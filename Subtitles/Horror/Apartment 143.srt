1
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,223
Check check.
One-two, One-two.

2
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,560
Check check. Check?
Okay, groovy.

3
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:23,105
Paul Ortega, reporting live
from the inside of a glorious van,

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,233
capturing this moment
for posterity. I'm...

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,652
what's the best way
to describe it? I'm the...

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,612
technical expert.
Technological...

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,157
I'm the expert, that's me.
Yeah, I know, I know.

8
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,743
Ellen Keegan--
young, beautiful,

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,746
gatekeeper of the group.
What's a gatekeeper, Ellen?

10
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,831
That's right, nobody knows.

11
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,292
Ellen is shy by day.
But by night?

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,877
Grrr.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,005
Ellen answers the phone.
You our secretary, Ellen?

14
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,132
I would love to scratch that.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,093
Yeah, Ellen still doesn't know
she's our secretary-- by day.

16
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,179
By night-- grrr.

17
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,765
Joseph Helzer-- Dr. Helzer.
My boss, Ellen's boss,

18
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,267
but that's obvious
given Ellen is the secretary.

19
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,519
- Ellen: Not the secretary.
- No? You're the telephone girl.

20
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,022
- Not the telephone girl.
- No? You're the gatekeeper?

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,690
- Exactly.
- Exactly. Ellen still doesn't know

22
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,941
she's the telephone girl.

23
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,943
Ow. It's Friday.

24
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,321
The sun is shining.
It's 2:00 in the afternoon--

25
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,615
- Ellen: Half past 2:00.
- Half 2:00, who cares? I do.

26
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,076
- Why? Because who am I?
- Ellen: An idiot with a camera?

27
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,495
I am the technological expert.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,041
Paul: From here
it looks like any old building.

29
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,460
- Helzer: From here they all do.
- Paul: That's true.

30
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,091
Sorry. We shouldn't have
loaded so much weight.

31
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,009
Paul:
Don't worry, you look great.

32
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,395
Hi.

33
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,940
Thank you so much for coming.

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,110
- Please, come in.
- Thank you, Mr. White.

35
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,028
- Hi.
- Hi.

36
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,281
I hope you don't mind.
It's just for our own records.

37
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,117
You know, internal use.

38
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,285
White:
Kitchen's on the left. Bathroom.

39
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,538
The kids' room is down
at the end of the hall.

40
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,915
Sorry for the mess.
Dining room, living room.

41
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,251
- Ellen: Well, so...
- Paul: Nice place.

42
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,628
- Here we are.
- Paul: I'm gonna put this down here.

43
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,005
Can we set up
our equipment in this room?

44
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,591
Yeah, of course, whatever.
Make yourself at home.

45
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,969
- Ellen: Just let me have a look.
- The children?

46
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,680
Yeah, uh...

47
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,224
my youngest is gonna
be home from school soon.

48
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,602
And Caitlin is in her room.

49
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,149
She's not really happy
about all this, so...

50
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,234
If you want, I can call her.

51
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,987
No, we've got all weekend.
One step at a time.

52
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,446
- It's okay.
- I'm going to get the rest

53
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,074
of the stuff from the car.
Does anyone want to give me a hand?

54
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,412
Paul:
Can I go?

55
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,959
Hey, little man.
Wave to the camera.

56
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,713
Oh, thank you.

57
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,423
- Ellen: What's your name?
- Benny.

58
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,633
Benny? That's a lovely name.

59
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,012
Good boy.
Can you wave to the camera?

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,555
- Paul: Wave one more time.
- Say hi.

61
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,599
- Say hi.
- Paul: Oh, thank you.

62
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,643
Woman:
Bye, Benny! Bye, Benny.

63
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,146
Do you... want some help
with your stuff or...?

64
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,356
- Paul: Well, actually...
- Ellen: No no.

65
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,027
No thank you, no, Mr. White.
We're fine. We'll see you up there.

66
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,570
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye, Benny.

67
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,030
Bye.

68
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,533
Big mouth.

69
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,047
Okay.

70
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,133
Check. One-two, one-two.

71
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,560
See? She's going to make a picture.

72
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,063
We're going to make a picture
of the whole weekend.

73
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,952
Scared? You scared?

74
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,537
Er... yeah. Now see, don't do that.
That's... that's not fun.

75
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,749
- You already got the kitchen, right?
- Yeah, we did.

76
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,793
- It's just the girl's room that's left?
- That's right.

77
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,170
Just a second.
Excuse me. Sorry.

78
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,005
Let me...

79
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,887
- Caitlin?
- Caitlin: Go away!

80
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,473
Sweetie, they need to set up
in your room, honey.

81
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,351
I'm sorry.
She's just at a really difficult age.

82
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,645
Ellen:
That's all right.

83
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,107
Caitlin, we are coming in, I have to
open the door. I'm really sorry, honey.

84
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,359
Leave me alone!

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,032
Maybe you can set up
in there later?

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,201
- Paul: Well, actually--
- Sure.

87
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,370
- Okay.
- Ellen: Yeah, it's no problem.

88
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,252
Paul:
I'm on it.

89
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,560
- Does this happen often?
- Yes.

90
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,729
Sometimes.
We don't know what it is though.

91
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,564
White:
Are there people living upstairs?

92
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,983
No, there's hardly
any tenants in this building.

93
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,193
- Is something wrong?
- It could be anything--

94
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,612
rusty pipes,
a rodent of some sort,

95
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,032
thermal dilation, woodworm,

96
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,908
mechanical vibrations.

97
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,202
Paul:
Yeah, sound abides by its own rules.

98
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,330
Yeah, that doesn't
sound like mice to me.

99
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,123
Tiptology.

100
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,125
Ellen:
Beats of unspecified origin.

101
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,044
Unknown.
Potentially anything.

102
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,759
Benny:
Paul, what's happening?

103
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,635
Paul:
Yeah, not now, buddy.

104
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,860
Helzer:
Paul, I need you to keep filming.

105
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,947
Ellen, change the frequency.
Raise the balance about 50%.

106
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,492
Let me know if you get
any espirical emission.

107
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,330
Nothing.

108
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,207
Ellen, keep doing what you're doing.

109
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,958
Paul, go upstairs,
see if anybody's there.

110
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,252
It's okay. No.
Guess what's behind me.

111
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,589
Guess what's behind me.
Guess what's behind me.

112
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,804
Helzer:
Yeah, Mr. White, you ready?

113
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,472
Have a seat.

114
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,890
Paul:
I'm just going to mic you really quick.

115
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,684
- Okay.
- It's just a simple mic. This...

116
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,270
- There we go.
- Helzer: Okay?

117
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,980
- Okay.
- Helzer: Hi, Benny.

118
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,900
Remember me?

119
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,568
Mr. Doctor.

120
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,278
My name is Alan White.

121
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:49,449
I was born
December 1 7th, 1 970.

122
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,035
- I used to be an agricultural engineer.
- Helzer: Mm-hmm.

123
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,956
- I'm no longer employed.
- Helzer: I'm sorry.

124
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,582
- Can you say that again?
- I'm no longer employed.

125
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,418
Helzer:
Do you know why we're here?

126
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,380
You wanna guess why we're here?

127
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,633
I am no longer married. I'm...

128
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,594
- I'm a widower, I guess.
- Helzer: Mmm.

129
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,222
My name is Benjamin White.

130
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,099
- Helzer: How old are you?
- Four.

131
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,436
Let's talk a little bit about why
you got in touch with the Institute.

132
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,312
Well, it kind of all started--

133
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,065
we used to live out in Riverside,

134
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,317
kind of out near
sort of Moreno Valley.

135
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,112
My wife Cynthia

136
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,198
was a teacher
at the local elementary school there.

137
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,992
She was very sick.

138
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,202
One time
she was in bed for a week.

139
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,621
White:
A few months after she passed away,

140
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,623
things...

141
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,877
things in the house
started to become very odd.

142
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,505
The lights were flashing
on and off,

143
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,176
on and off,
just all the time.

144
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,802
And we checked all the wires.

145
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,180
We revamped
the entire electrical system.

146
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,265
And he said that there
was nothing wrong.

147
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,435
Our stuff in the kitchen
were flying too.

148
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,479
There was one time
when we heard

149
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,564
that somebody was
using the typewriter.

150
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,317
I don't know who it was.
But we were sitting there, all of us--

151
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,112
Benny, me, Caitlin.

152
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,406
We just kind of laughed it off
and sort of pretended,

153
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,408
you know, "Oh..."
And Benny was like

154
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,619
"Oh, it's..."
you know, "it's Mom."

155
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,413
She's not dead or alive.

156
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,499
- Helzer: Is it scary?
- Huh-uh-uh.

157
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,875
When you see your mother,

158
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,877
- can you talk to her?
- Yeah.

159
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,671
- Does she talk back to you?
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,091
Helzer: Say that again, when you said
Benny pretended like it was Mom.

161
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,345
Well, he just--
ever since she died he's always kinda...

162
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,848
sort of played like
she was in the room,

163
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,059
like she was present.

164
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,102
Helzer:
Sorry. Sorry. We're almost there.

165
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,437
Okay.

166
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,022
Helzer:
Okay. Great.

167
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,566
Caitlin used to get
these scratches on her legs.

168
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,235
Really?

169
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,781
She had scratches on her legs.

170
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,783
- It wasn't me.
- White: Honestly, I started

171
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,202
to get really concerned
for the safety of my kids.

172
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,455
So I pulled up stakes

173
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,917
and we moved here to...

174
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,879
this-- this place.

175
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,757
And everything was fine,

176
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,677
it seemed like,
for a week or two,

177
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,721
and...

178
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,683
and then it--
and then it all started again.

179
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,071
Benny:
Good doggy.

180
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,384
Benny on computer:
Good doggy.

181
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,512
Good dog. Good dog.

182
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,397
- Ellen?
- Yeah?

183
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,958
Ellen: Hi, Benny.

184
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,420
Hey, Benny.

185
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,143
Benny:
Why is she putting it up there?

186
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,646
Paul:
'Cause she's kind of a big poser.

187
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,523
I'm putting the camera on the tripod
because I need it to stay still.

188
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,734
All of these pictures have to be

189
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,655
taken in a really kind of
particular way, Benny,

190
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,033
so I need it to stay still
for a few minutes at a time.

191
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,826
Do you want to do it?
Come here.

192
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,453
- Whoa! Good boy.
- Which button?

193
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,331
Press that button there.
You got it?

194
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,124
Here we go.

195
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,128
- Paul: Okay, anytime today.
- Yeah okay.

196
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,047
You try carrying this thing around.

197
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,219
- You look so determined.
- I am determined.

198
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,597
- I'm a professional, Paul.
- Oh, is that what they call you?

199
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,308
- Benny: What's this?
- Paul: Hey!

200
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,852
- Where'd you get that?
- From your backpack.

201
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,897
- Paul: It's a bomb.
- It's not a bomb.

202
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,899
- Give it back.
- Ellen: Don't mind him, love. Here.

203
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,651
- Paul: Benny.
- Ellen: Stop it, it's not a bomb.

204
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,444
- Paul: Yes, it is.
- Ellen: It's an infrared detector.

205
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,363
It detects mass of invisible energy

206
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,824
and it sees things we can't see,

207
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,368
just like Zelda hears things
we can't hear.

208
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,537
Hi. Is it all right if we take...

209
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,996
- Hi.
- ...a couple of pictures in here?

210
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,790
- Yeah yeah, of course.
- Ellen: Great. Thank you.

211
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,130
- Benny: The lights are on.
- Yeah.

212
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,966
Why are you taking pictures
with this light thing?

213
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,176
- What? With the flash?
- Uh-huh.

214
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,637
- Paul: Because...
- Nobody knows why

215
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,057
but sometimes when you
take a picture with a flash

216
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,684
you can see things.

217
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,562
- Benny: What things?
- Ellen: Just things.

218
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,314
You heard it, kid. "Things."

219
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,860
Ellen: Come on, Benny!
Let's go and do the next room.

220
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,529
Come on.
You can even take a picture.

221
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,573
What are these?

222
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,867
Paul:
Those are feet-slicing laser beams.

223
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,411
- I don't believe you.
- Ellen: Yeah well, you're right,

224
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,996
because they're motion sensors.

225
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,789
They can tell when people
are moving around.

226
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,458
Do you want to see?
Wait there.

227
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,878
So... ah!
It's changed, didn't it?

228
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,380
Benny: Yes.

229
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,350
We need to take a few pictures.

230
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,478
It'll just take a minute.

231
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,288
- It's all my dad's fault.
- Ellen: What?

232
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,709
I'm pretty sure I wasn't talking to you.

233
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,964
She hates me.

234
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,342
She's a teenager, Mr. White.

235
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,136
You shouldn't let her actions
affect you so much.

236
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,055
You're doing just fine.

237
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,848
The thing is that I was on a trip

238
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,100
the night that Cynthia--

239
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,604
I just wasn't home, you know?
So Caitlin...

240
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,608
blames me for everything.

241
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,987
She says that if I was--
stayed with her that night,

242
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,866
that if I had stayed
with her that maybe there...

243
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,245
that maybe she'd still...

244
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,664
maybe she'd...

245
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,916
Jesus Christ.

246
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,960
Did Caitlin see her mother die?

247
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,170
No.

248
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,172
No, God no. No.

249
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,093
She was with me when it happened.
Both my kids were.

250
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,138
Um...

251
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,642
God. I mean thank God that
nobody saw her die 'cause it was a...

252
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,311
it was terrible car crash.

253
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,397
There's no point in
over thinking these things.

254
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,569
What really matters--

255
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,697
and believe me when I tell you
it's of extreme importance--

256
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,701
it's what you do now,
how you handle the situation.

257
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,625
How do I talk to my daughter?

258
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,003
How?
I mean, I-- I--

259
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,756
I have no idea what to say to her.

260
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,469
I'm doing everything I can.

261
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,557
I'm trying.

262
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,269
But I just...

263
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,771
I don't know how
to communicate to her,

264
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,524
you know?
Cynthia was the one

265
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,110
that she really listened to.

266
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,322
She was the one that made
things work around here.

267
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,532
I just...

268
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,412
How do you talk to a teenage girl?
I don't know.

269
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,706
Helzer:
How did your wife do it?

270
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,257
Sometimes I like to think
that she's here,

271
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,928
that she knows
that I need her help.

272
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,689
Man on TV: Lloyd & Tuess,
which is a very well-known,

273
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,567
prestigious accounting firm,
has a very good piece--

274
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,653
by the way,
which you can get free.

275
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,614
It's 1 00 pages long.

276
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,699
Woman: If you can find somebody

277
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,660
to take it off your hands,

278
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,162
you'll be doing well
if you get 50¢ on the dollar.

279
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,247
Man:
Let us give you the number anyway.

280
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,626
- Man #2: Okay. Right.
- It's 800-35--

281
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,755
Hey, thanks, man.

282
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,888
- Hey.
- Hey.

283
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,015
- What'd you get me?
- I got it.

284
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,268
Okay? Don't look at me
like I don't get you what you want.

285
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,398
Man: Now I need to get out of it.

286
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,692
It's almost like a time-share...

287
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,486
- I'll get it.
- "Well, I want to sell it for profit."

288
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,322
Well, if you can sell it all,
you're going to be lucky.

289
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,699
- Hello?
- 500,000 people are trying

290
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,785
- to sell time-shares...
- Hello?

291
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,706
Nobody is there.

292
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,502
Paul: I just put
some anchovies in my sandwich.

293
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,337
- Ellen: Why?
- White: Hello?

294
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,008
Hello?

295
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,222
Benny: Mom?

296
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,861
Hello?

297
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,988
- This happens all the time.
- Paul, did you get that?

298
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,573
- Paul: Absolutely.
- Ellen.

299
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,867
- Ellen: Paul, give me the spotter.
- Benny: It's Mom.

300
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,503
Paul: Nobody?

301
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,633
- The kitchen.
- And nobody's there.

302
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,135
- White: Benny!
- Helzer: It's okay, it's okay.

303
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,887
They're not in there.
Paul, I want you to come first.

304
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,096
Paul:
Yep, I got it.

305
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,893
Oh man! All in order.

306
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,521
- There's just nothing there.
- Okay, in you go.

307
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,399
Paul:
Nothing.

308
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,736
Daddy.

309
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,821
It's okay, you're safe.
You okay?

310
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,407
I am not okay.

311
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,701
- White: Does anybody want any tea?
- Ellen: Yeah me.

312
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,496
I think we could all use a cup.
Where is it?

313
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,706
- Just up in the cupboard.
- Yeah.

314
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,461
White: Oh God, I thought
the whole kitchen had...

315
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,338
- Ellen: I know.
- ...gone absolutely mad.

316
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,340
Paul: It's the weirdest thing.

317
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,177
White:
Benny, wait. Wait!

318
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,387
This is how it started.

319
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,649
Paul: Just a second, please.
Hold this. You got it?

320
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,944
Ellen: Yeah.

321
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,321
Helzer:
Unusual electromagnetic activity.

322
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,448
We got alterations in the field.

323
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,244
Here's what I'm gonna do.
Keep the line going.

324
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,287
Ellen:
Temperature's dropping 1 0°.

325
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,414
- It just got really cold.
- Helzer: Stay on the line.

326
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,375
- Ellen: Yeah, got it.
- Okay.

327
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,502
And then take this,
bring it up here. Yep.

328
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,003
Ellen:
I'm ready.

329
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,713
Okay?

330
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,132
- Helzer: Yep?
- Yep.

331
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,553
Whew.

332
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,981
Helzer: Take the headsets off!
Are you okay?

333
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,316
- Oh my God, are you okay?
- Do you want me to film?

334
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,901
I'm fine. I got it.

335
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,675
- Ellen: Here we go.
- Helzer: Oh, thank you.

336
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,052
You're welcome.

337
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,720
- Paul: Thanks.
- Ellen: Sure.

338
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,309
Paul: So what do you think
is the matter with the girl?

339
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,648
It's not uncommon for children

340
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,984
to blame their parents
in the case of a separation.

341
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,487
Often it's just a projection
of their guilt.

342
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,989
They're trying to make sense
of feelings they don't understand,

343
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,076
and it can come out like a reproach.

344
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,745
It's the same thing with death.

345
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,373
Nobody wants to accept it.

346
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,210
And that girl is
at an especially conflictive age.

347
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,463
Paul:
So you think the father...?

348
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,716
I feel sorry for him.
He's having a terrible time.

349
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,927
He doesn't know what's going on.

350
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,722
When will you be able
to analyze the recordings, Paul?

351
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,059
I was gonna upload it tonight,
unless you want me to do it now.

352
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,061
No no no. No big deal.

353
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,313
Whenever you get a chance.

354
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,233
We're dealing with a ghost, right?

355
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,112
I mean, like one
of the good ones, right?

356
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,823
The raps could be anything.
But the crockery...

357
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,117
And who took the kettle
off the stove?

358
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,869
I've never seen anything
like it before in my life.

359
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,957
One step at a time, Ellen.
One step at a time.

360
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,340
- Hi, how's it going?
- Hey. All right.

361
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,758
Everything seems normal.

362
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,302
Ellen:
You know, I've been thinking.

363
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,804
I know it's too soon
to jump to conclusions,

364
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,098
but do you think this could be...?

365
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,767
I mean, it'd be amazing.

366
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,687
It's been years since
we've encountered a real haunting.

367
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,565
The kettle's driving me nuts.

368
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,402
Hold on.
Watch the teapot.

369
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,906
Damn.

370
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,451
- It's crazy, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,745
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

372
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,955
I've checked the readings
of the magnetometer

373
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,333
and only the children's room
shows anything irregular.

374
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,044
But I'm not even sure about that.
It was only for a second.

375
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,595
Ellen:
Hold on a second.

376
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,180
Okay, just back.

377
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,141
Stop.

378
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,268
Left.

379
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,689
Paul:
What the hell is that?

380
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,734
- Ellen: It looks like a human figure.
- Paul: That's what it looks like.

381
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,361
I don't know.
Hold on a sec.

382
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,076
Bring up the contrast.

383
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,662
Can you clean that up?

384
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,168
Paul:
Oh man.

385
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,295
Ellen: Shit.

386
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,593
Should we wake him up?

387
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,638
No, let him sleep.
He can see it tomorrow.

388
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,475
Do you want to get some sleep?

389
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,685
I can take over if you want.

390
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,357
Are you mad?

391
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,860
No, I'm fine.

392
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,488
Don't worry about me.
Go get some rest.

393
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,158
I'll...
I'll finish up here.

394
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,195
Rise and shine.
Hey, Benny.

395
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,447
You're already up.

396
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,325
Wake up, guys.

397
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,577
You guys almost slept
the entire day away.

398
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,454
It's a beautiful day,
come on wake up.

399
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,373
- Shut the window.
- Wake up, Caitlin.

400
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,124
Hey, Benny.
I made

401
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,418
blueberry pancakes
with eggs and bacon.

402
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,671
- My favorite.
- Yep, I know.

403
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,381
Okay, come on, Caitlin, let's go.

404
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,424
It's Saturday, Alan.
Shut the window.

405
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,718
I know it's Saturday, Caitlin,

406
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,429
but you guys have already slept
until almost 1 0:00, so let's go.

407
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,641
Come on, breakfast is on the table.
I made your favorite.

408
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,227
Fuck off.

409
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,605
Okay, go ahead, Benny.

410
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,774
Why don't you go ahead
and run to the table? Thanks.

411
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,193
Caitlin, when I ask you
to get up,

412
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,071
- you get up.
- Shut the window, Alan.

413
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,031
You are not to use that
language around Benny.

414
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,825
- Do you understand me?
- Shut the fucking window.

415
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,660
- What?
- It is Saturday.

416
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,954
What?
Get up, Caitlin.

417
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:25,124
Get up!
I'm fed up with your attitude.

418
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,585
Get up.

419
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,587
This is unbelievable.
Get up!

420
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,089
Don't touch me,
don't touch me, don't touch me!

421
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,008
- Don't touch me.
- Caitlin.

422
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,803
I will get up,
but do not fucking touch me.

423
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,311
Are you going to watch me
get dressed now?

424
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,661
White: Benny.

425
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,750
Thank you.

426
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,587
White:
How did everybody sleep?

427
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,631
- Just fine, Mr. White, thank you.
- Ellen: Mmm.

428
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,467
White:
I want to apologize

429
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,678
for not having any extra rooms
or beds or anything,

430
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,181
but maybe if one of you wants
to sleep in my bed tonight,

431
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,682
- that's fine.
- No no no.

432
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,560
- Paul: That's actually--
- We-- we-- we insist.

433
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,229
Don't put yourself out.

434
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,440
Thanks.
I really really appreciate it.

435
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,734
Thank you, Mr. White.

436
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,696
Caitlin, can you pass
the sugar, sweetie?

437
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,115
Pass it yourself.

438
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,660
And I'm not your sweetheart.

439
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,536
Caitlin, when you're in this house,

440
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,914
you do what I ask you to do,
when I ask you.

441
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,124
Do you understand me?

442
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,552
Benny, stop playing with your food.

443
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,015
Stop playing with--

444
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,396
Oh, I'm so proud of you, Paul.

445
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,940
I'm gonna send this tape to your ma.

446
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,526
Don't bother,
she has her own tapes--

447
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,945
Paul ironing,
Paul making the bed,

448
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,905
Paul masturbating.

449
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,615
Who needs to be good at their job

450
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,617
when they can wash dishes
for a living, eh?

451
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,704
One day,
and that day will soon come,

452
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,207
men around the world will see their
rights acknowledged and respected.

453
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,710
You're laughing now,
but we'll see how cheerful you are

454
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,003
the day men cast aside
their domestic chores

455
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,090
and conquer the workplace.
And we'll only be a couple steps away

456
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,426
- from the right to vote, you know.
- Hold on a second,

457
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,720
- step aside.
- So now that I'm done with the dishes,

458
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,514
- you just want me gone.
- Really, Paul, step aside.

459
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,149
How strange.

460
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,194
No no, wait.
Here, hold this.

461
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,448
Yeah.

462
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,455
Paul: Was it like this yesterday?

463
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,248
I've no idea.

464
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,795
Oh, shit.
It's a blind spot.

465
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,714
Ellen:
Oh, shit.

466
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,767
Paul:
There's gotta be some record if it.

467
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,186
We took pictures
of the entire living room.

468
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,443
- Ellen: There it is.
- Paul: Yeah, I see it.

469
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,862
White:
What does this mean?

470
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,448
Last night,
the photo was right side up.

471
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,825
There's no footprints
in the talcum powder,

472
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,786
so nobody could
have possibly moved it.

473
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,288
If nobody moved it then--

474
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,463
- Wait, the photo.
- Ellen: What photo?

475
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,633
The shadow, Ellen.
The photo we took in Caitlin's room.

476
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,261
It's not here.
It's been deleted.

477
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,201
Ellen: Jesus Christ!

478
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,119
- Did you get that?
- Ellen: Yeah.

479
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,497
- Please tell me you got that apport.
- Ellen: Yeah, I got it.

480
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,915
- Paul: Did you see that?
- Ellen: Yeah.

481
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,626
- Time to move on to the next stage.
- Paul: Oh man!

482
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,294
My God.

483
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,784
Heseltine?
Yeah, it's Helzer.

484
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,620
Paul:
It's better inside than outside.

485
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,289
Helzer: Okay?

486
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,666
Paul: Melting our asses off
in there, huh?

487
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,252
Helzer:
We got an apport this morning.

488
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,547
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Paul: Yeah, no worries, no worries.

489
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,260
The stuff that's going on
up there, is it safe?

490
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,345
Paul: We're checking
some things out. I mean,

491
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,389
what happened up there
is what we call

492
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,267
a brief episode
of phantasmogenesis.

493
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,895
And, essentially,
the ultrasound transistor

494
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,148
is supposed to be useful
in making annoying spirits disappear.

495
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,734
We don't know why,
but it does work, so.

496
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,279
Okay, put your hand on Zelda
and then I'm going to do the same thing,

497
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,949
and we're going to work out
which one of us has special powers.

498
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,702
So I'm going to concentrate
really, really hard

499
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,914
and I'm going to try
and make her hair go red, yeah?

500
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,537
- Ellen: Everything's clean.
- Paul: All clear, doctor.

501
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,039
- It worked.
- Ellen: Clean.

502
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,667
Paul:
Doctor?

503
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,460
I think we should--

504
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,424
It was just a draft.

505
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,012
Let me check.

506
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,830
Paul:
The flash drive.

507
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,040
Benny.
Today we're going to use

508
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,751
a whole bunch of
different machines, Benny.

509
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,212
White:
What is this?

510
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,090
We're setting up
an electrostatic generator.

511
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,092
Um, it's really hard to explain.

512
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,969
But if you could just bear with me.

513
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,471
No no. Excuse me.
I need to know what's happening.

514
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,725
The materialization of ghosts
depends on electrostatic charges.

515
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,769
The emission of these ions
boosts their presence.

516
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,772
- Something like that.
- So I can take my kids to their room?

517
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,775
Yeah, I want to go to my room,
but I'm not a freaking kid.

518
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,154
I really need them here.
Don't worry, it's not dangerous.

519
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,577
Ellen:
All yours.

520
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,546
What's that thing over there?

521
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,007
- That thing there?
- Yes.

522
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,675
It's a stroboscopic light emitter.

523
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,303
Oh.
And that gray thing over there?

524
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,889
Helzer:
Maybe we'll talk about that one later.

525
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,515
Do you know what stroboscopic light is?

526
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,725
Benny: Yes.

527
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,811
- Do you want me to tell you anyway?
- Benny: Yes.

528
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,898
Helzer:
You know the images on television,

529
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,234
like when you're watching a cartoon
or something like that on TV?

530
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,321
The images look stable,
but actually

531
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,948
each one is flickering
a certain amount of times

532
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,242
each second.
See what I mean?

533
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,995
- Hmm.
- Sometimes people say

534
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,290
they glimpsed a ghost
out of the corner of their eyes,

535
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,168
and that's how it is.
You understand?

536
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,128
- Yes.
- Good boy.

537
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,799
You know like discos
with flickering lights

538
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,842
that make everything go
wild and crazy?

539
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,469
- Yes.
- It's kinda like that.

540
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,304
Just go put out
the lights right now.

541
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,348
Ellen: Just stand right over there.
Thank you.

542
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,599
Right there. Great.

543
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,394
Benny:
I can't see anything.

544
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,480
Ellen:
Benny, love.

545
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,940
Paul:
Hey, Benny, come here.

546
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,858
Let me show you something.

547
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:15,070
See how on that really small screen

548
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,031
everything looks green even though
you can't see anything out there?

549
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,117
- Yes.
- Paul: Aha.

550
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,619
Well, that's 'cause these
cameras can see at night,

551
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,996
- even though we can't. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

552
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,582
Now we're going to change
the button because

553
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,210
there's going to be lots of light
and we're not gonna need it, okay?

554
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,087
Want to press the button?

555
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,864
Paul: Benny, Ellen, are you okay?

556
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,158
Helzer:
Lights, quickly! Lights up!

557
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,830
Paul:
Check over here.

558
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,458
Are you both okay?
What was that?

559
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,585
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I just need to--

560
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,670
one--

561
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,644
Aha.

562
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,455
Attention all patrons.

563
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,999
In case of an emergency,
please contact

564
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,293
the Los Angeles sheriff
at 323-

565
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,880
563-5000.
Please report

566
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,258
all unattended packages...

567
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,599
There you go.

568
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,193
I'm sorry, I just need
to fix your microphones.

569
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,903
Just say one-two,
one-two.

570
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,780
One-two, one-two.

571
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,090
It's an anechoic Faraday chamber.

572
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,010
We use it to carry out
psychophonic recordings.

573
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,305
The cage ensures
the authenticity of the psychophony

574
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,434
by completely isolating the recorder
from possible spurious radio wavelengths

575
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,602
and atmospheric sounds.
You got it?

576
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,646
Basically
if it picks something up,

577
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,815
it means there really is
something to pick up.

578
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,692
Whenever you're ready, doctor.

579
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,321
Mr. White, it's gonna be okay.

580
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,159
I'm going to recite
a series of questions out loud,

581
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,454
and I'm going to leave several seconds
of silence in-between.

582
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,664
- Understood?
- White: Sure.

583
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,959
Later we're gonna analyze
the tape and we'll check it in detail

584
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,212
to see if there's any sounds
other than my voice.

585
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,591
Sometimes it happens.
Not often.

586
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,471
Do you give us permission
to carry out this procedure?

587
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,474
White: Yeah. Can I take
Benny out of the room first?

588
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,559
If it's okay,
I'd rather everybody stays.

589
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,519
It's gonna be fine.
Don't worry.

590
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,532
Who are you?

591
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,505
Why are you here?

592
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,854
Are you dead?

593
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,160
Do you mean to do us harm?

594
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,297
All right, Mr. White.
Is there anything you want to add?

595
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,383
Caitlin:
Who killed you?

596
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,687
Helzer on tape:
Who are you?

597
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,783
Why are you here?

598
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,916
Are you dead?

599
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,215
Do you mean to do us harm?

600
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,850
Nothing.
I've listened to it 1 00 times.

601
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,477
There's just nothing there.

602
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,228
You want to do
another recording?

603
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,106
Don't worry.
It's just like I expected.

604
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,234
Mr. White, may I join you?

605
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,945
Sure.

606
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,036
- Oh, do you mind?
- No, go ahead.

607
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,097
Ellen: Can you feel it?

608
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,104
White:
What is it? What's happening?

609
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,032
Something is about to happen.

610
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,952
Paul: Look!

611
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,542
Ellen:
The temperature has dropped by 14°

612
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,585
in a matter of seconds
in the kids' room.

613
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,213
Better plug in, guys.
Batteries are about to die.

614
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,721
Dr. Helzer,
I have to go check on my kids.

615
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,557
White: Stay where you are.
Don't move.

616
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,141
Dr. Helzer, I've got
to go check on my kids.

617
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,977
Don't worry.
Stay where you are.

618
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,438
- Fire 'em up.
- Paul: Let me open up the program here.

619
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,193
Uhhh...

620
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,862
damn!
What is that?

621
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,782
- White: I've got to go. I've got to--
- Stay where you are. I told you!

622
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,826
- Can you get any closer?
- Not with the optic zoom.

623
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,620
I can try with the electronic one,
but we're going to lose definition.

624
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,038
- Helzer: Do it.
- Okay.

625
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,165
Yep.

626
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,258
White:
Oh my God. What's doing that?

627
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,052
What the hell is happening here?

628
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,596
I have to go and save her.

629
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,681
Helzer:
Stay where you are, for the final time!

630
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,058
- That's my daughter! My daughter!
- Mr. White!

631
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,977
Caitlin!

632
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,367
White:
I guess I just want to know why the...

633
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,494
ghost hasn't left.
I'm sorry, I'm just having

634
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,038
- a hard time saying this.
- Don't worry.

635
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,333
There is no ghost.

636
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,835
Look, I don't care what you call it,

637
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,838
but something weird is living here,

638
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,757
something that's...
I don't know.

639
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,592
Something supernatural.

640
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,054
What is it?

641
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,932
I can assure you there's nothing
supernatural in the universe, Mr. White,

642
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,852
because nature can't transcend itself.

643
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,980
These are just unexplained phenomena.

644
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,691
I'm afraid that parapsychology is really

645
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,485
just a collection of events

646
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,403
in search of a theory.

647
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,530
Perhaps the key lies
in finding a hypothesis

648
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,116
which can be applied
to each individual case

649
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:25,078
instead of insisting on one
that can be applied wholesale.

650
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,497
I can't understand a word
that you're saying.

651
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,916
I just want to know how we ended up

652
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,126
in a haunted house.
What did I miss?

653
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,961
That's precisely my point.

654
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,755
Your house isn't haunted.

655
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,590
We can rule that out.

656
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,177
Now I'd say that this is
a case of spontaneous

657
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,554
and recurring psychokinesis.

658
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,683
- A case of...?
- It's a poltergeist syndrome.

659
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,227
A poltergeist syndrome?
So we have...

660
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,853
spirits living in our house?

661
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,356
No no no.
It has nothing to do with that.

662
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,983
The phenomenon
of a haunted house

663
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,319
is always associated with a place.

664
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:02,115
It occurs in the same place
and over a long period of time.

665
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:06,035
In a haunted house,
we're up against ghosts,

666
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,372
specters--
dead people. in a word.

667
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,667
Now a ghost,
that's a dead person who has

668
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,253
died but they're not able to move on

669
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,547
or they don't want to for some reason.

670
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,549
A specter, that's different. It's...

671
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,843
it's like a recording,

672
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,221
a recording in light,
like an old film.

673
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,140
The poltergeist,
on the other hand,

674
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,017
that's always associated
with the psychism of someone alive.

675
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,645
After all, this phenomena started
in your other house

676
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,522
and followed you to this one.

677
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,816
It's kind of hard to believe
we'd be up against

678
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,402
two haunted houses,
wouldn't you say?

679
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,321
But we're scientists,
so we had to make sure.

680
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,744
But my-- my wife?

681
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,330
I'm afraid we can rule that out too.

682
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,626
Yeah, like I was saying,
the poltergeist syndrome?

683
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,463
That's associated
with the psychism of someone alive.

684
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,299
The phenomena are often violent,

685
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,384
but they're not supernatural.

686
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,720
The good news is
they don't last very long.

687
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,305
- The good news?
- Yeah.

688
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,183
They recur over
a relatively short period of time.

689
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,143
The cause isn't exactly known,

690
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,855
but they would seem
to come about with people

691
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,608
that are going through
periods of acute stress,

692
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,736
as if their subconscious rage

693
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:25,865
or sense of anxiety
or guilt is manifesting itself,

694
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,202
mobilizing substantial amounts
of psychic energy

695
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,538
and then channeling it
in extremely violent ways.

696
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,375
Girls-- adolescents

697
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,836
in the full flush of hormonal change

698
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,464
are often from where it stems,

699
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,008
but it can be the case
with little boys

700
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,803
or even adults under
a great deal of pressure.

701
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,556
This family-- and forgive me
for being so flippant--

702
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,601
has a number of odds-on favorites.

703
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,025
Hi, Lamson.
Thank you so much for coming.

704
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,569
It's no problem.

705
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,157
So how are you doing?

706
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,909
How are you doing?

707
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,038
White:
Caitlin, Benny! Grandpa is here.

708
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,957
- Why don't you come and say hi?
- Grandpa!

709
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,000
Lamson: Hey!

710
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:22,338
Benny: I packed all by myself.
I packed my train and my truck--

711
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,925
Caitlin, please come
say hi to your grandpa.

712
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:34,392
Caitlin, will you please come
and say hi to your grandpa?

713
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,400
I'm sorry. She hasn't
quite been herself lately.

714
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,652
So this is just for tonight.

715
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,240
I will come and get him tomorrow
first thing in the morning, I promise.

716
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,368
You know that Margaret
can barely move.

717
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,245
You know that, right?

718
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,205
I wouldn't have called you
if it wasn't important.

719
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,666
Benny:
Daddy, can I take Zelda with me?

720
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,835
You know, I don't think
it's a good idea, Benny.

721
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,004
Grandpa's got a lot on his plate.

722
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:06,924
I hope you know what you're doing.

723
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,386
Zelda. Zelda.

724
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,057
Come on.
Zelda, come on. Come on.

725
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,354
Helzer: It's the only way of determining
the cause of the anomalous events.

726
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:24,358
If the occurrences cease,
the boy's the cause.

727
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,985
If not,

728
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,905
it's for the best.

729
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,324
That boy's seen more
than enough already.

730
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,629
- That's fine, yeah. Take a seat.
- Thank you.

731
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,813
Helzer:
There are times when science seems

732
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,440
to have run out of answers,

733
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,442
and we have to turn

734
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,819
to those with a special gift.

735
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:12,615
Heseltine is one of the most
renowned psychics in the country.

736
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,242
- Sensitive.
- Helzer: Sensitive.

737
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,037
Now...
we're gonna try

738
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,665
an exercise in mediumship.

739
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,250
No, not exactly. Channeling.

740
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:27,004
White: I'm sorry.
What's that, like spiritism?

741
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,381
- No.
- Caitlin: Spiritism.

742
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,299
Channeling.

743
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,760
Caitlin:
Hallelujah, we're saved.

744
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,929
White:
Caitlin, please.

745
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,099
Good.

746
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,982
Would it be possible to get
a higher chair, please?

747
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,234
White:
A higher chair?

748
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,448
I'm sorry.
That's all I have.

749
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:58,536
Then could you bring me the telephone
guide, if it isn't too much trouble?

750
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,415
White:
Caitlin, would you mind?

751
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,920
- Hold on.
- Okay.

752
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,100
- You want two or...
- No, that's-- thank you.

753
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,810
Thank you.

754
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,146
I can enter an invisible world

755
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,565
by raising my vibration.

756
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,608
Not many people know this,

757
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:33,446
but the other side is just
90 centimeters above our dimension.

758
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,408
That's why it's so common for people
to see ghosts from the waist up.

759
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,668
Good.
Something may happen today,

760
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,920
but then again, it may not.

761
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,549
There's no way
of knowing ahead of time.

762
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,176
But from now on,
I need everybody

763
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,887
to please remain silent,

764
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,514
no matter what takes place.

765
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:17,907
If by some unlikely stroke
of good fortune,

766
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,911
you do see an undead materialize

767
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,873
before your eyes, please don't
get carried away by your emotions.

768
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,542
Please.

769
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:32,922
Running away from a ghost
is an unforgiveable lack of delicacy.

770
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,302
It's so tough for them to appear.

771
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,340
Helzer:
Okay.

772
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:22,638
Okay.

773
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:38,445
Is there anybody there?

774
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,623
Is there anybody there with us?

775
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,804
Is there anyone there with you?

776
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,931
Yes, me.

777
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,226
Ellen:
Oh, God. Jesus Christ!

778
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,937
Helzer:
Who are you?

779
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,356
Ellen: Shit.

780
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,775
There are lots of us.

781
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:20,196
Helzer:
Is this Caitlin?

782
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,489
How do we know this isn't Caitlin?

783
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,242
Caitlin's voice:
There are lots of us.

784
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,494
Cynthia?
Is that you, Cynthia?

785
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,288
Shut up!
Get your hands off of her!

786
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,749
Mr. White, are you okay?

787
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,751
- Helzer: Is this Cynthia?
- Ellen: Doctor, what's going on?

788
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,211
"Is this Cynthia?"

789
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,630
Helzer: Do you wanna
tell us something about the accident?

790
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,341
Accident?!
It wasn't an accident.

791
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:43,302
Why are you saying that? I wasn't even
with her. I wasn't even with you!

792
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,471
Don't you dare talk to this girl
after what you've done.

793
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,390
- Helzer: What did Alan do to you?
- Caitlin: Not to me. To the girl!

794
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,517
All right, to the girl.

795
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,062
- Caitlin: You saw him.
- What did we see?

796
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,232
- You saw him !
- What did we see?

797
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,108
White: I haven't done anything.
I swear to God!

798
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:01,820
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

799
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,489
- Paul: Fuck!
- Helzer: Nobody move!

800
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,200
- Everybody stay seated.
- Paul: Doctor.

801
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,077
Paul: Oh, my God!

802
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,871
Paul: Oh, God!

803
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,874
Paul: Jesus!

804
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,085
Paul: Ellen! Oh, fuck!

805
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,671
- Damn!
- Ellen: Jesus Christ!

806
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,673
Paul: Watch out!

807
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,341
Ellen:
Doctor!

808
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,344
Paul: No, no, no, no.

809
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,721
Paul:
Oh, God.

810
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,141
- So how come--
- Ellen.

811
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,102
Oh, God. Oh, my God! It's all right.

812
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,521
It's okay.

813
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,606
Come on, that's a good girl.
Come with me.

814
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,192
Come on, that's it.
You're okay.

815
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,986
That's it.
You're okay.

816
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,988
Come on, let's go to your room.

817
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,073
That's it.
You're all right.

818
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,285
You're all right.
Come on. Good girl.

819
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,505
Can I have a cigarette, please?

820
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,635
- I didn't know you smoked, Ellen.
- I do today.

821
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,348
Cheers. Cheers.

822
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,725
You know...

823
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,978
I'm starting to believe that
what Caitlin's saying might be true.

824
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,565
What's she saying, Ellen?
What's true?

825
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,360
We've ruled out
a haunting and possession.

826
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,529
Caitlin's own psychism has to be
responsible for the marks on her thighs

827
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,823
and the scratches
her brother's talking about.

828
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,159
Perhaps she's projecting
her psychic energy

829
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:15,662
to accuse her father of something,

830
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,124
to expose some secret.

831
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:22,961
A secret? Why doesn't she just
come out with it, nice and simple?

832
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,506
Wouldn't that be easier?
Why all these games?

833
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:30,260
Maybe-- I mean, I don't know,
maybe she's buried the memory

834
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,304
in the depths of her subconscious
out of shame and guilt.

835
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,100
And now-- now it's--

836
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,810
the secret's manifesting itself,

837
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,229
emerging in the form
of physical injury.

838
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,023
You're the psychologist, not me.

839
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,363
Is it possible that Alan was somehow
responsible for his wife's death?

840
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,198
He says she was sick,
but we don't know that.

841
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,700
All we know is what he's telling us,
his side of the story.

842
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,161
You know, maybe--
I don't know.

843
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,288
Maybe he couldn't stand
her anymore, you know?

844
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:03,419
Maybe Alan is like a wolf in--

845
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,006
Why is my daughter doing this to me?

846
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:11,635
My own daughter.

847
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,139
She hates me.

848
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,351
Your daughter thinks of herself
as a woman, Mr. White,

849
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,061
and she's not.

850
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,105
She's a little girl
that misses her mother.

851
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,358
She probably feels guilty
for having not been able

852
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,277
to avoid her death.

853
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,280
You can't let this get to you, Alan.

854
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,906
You got the children to think about.

855
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:36,368
All I do is think about my children.

856
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,037
That's all I do.

857
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,665
Tell me about your wife.

858
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,959
Tell me about Cynthia.

859
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:55,304
I don't-- I don't know.
I don't know how to describe Cynthia.

860
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,014
She's--

861
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,351
I guess she is
a sweet, caring woman.

862
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,148
She was a wonderful teacher.

863
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:10,068
She was loved by her students,

864
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,570
by her colleagues.

865
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,741
She was the perfect mother.

866
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,748
I can't-- I can't do this.

867
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,503
How do you describe a person anyway?
How do you?

868
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,632
You know,
sometimes I will-- I will--

869
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:34,218
lay in bed at night
and I will try to think about her

870
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,803
and I can't remember her face.

871
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,806
It doesn't make any sense at all.

872
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,522
I will shut my eyes as tight as I can,

873
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:50,776
and I'll dig my nails into my skin.

874
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,654
I try to-- I have to hurt
myself and then I'll--

875
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:56,490
and then maybe I'll feel
the need to cry--

876
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,617
to cry for a long time,

877
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,787
and her image will come back
to me, but not always.

878
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,748
When did she stop
taking her medication?

879
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,128
How do--
how do you know that?

880
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,964
She just stopped taking
it one day, didn't she?

881
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,925
She knew it was gonna change her.
She didn't do anything about it.

882
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,886
Why didn't you?
Did you stop loving her?

883
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,848
No.

884
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,729
No, I-- I couldn't do anything.

885
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,440
There wasn't anything
I could do. She wasn't--

886
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,734
she wasn't the kind of
person that would--

887
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,405
she didn't allow me
to help her in any way.

888
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:41,368
I-- I couldn't.

889
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,246
Yeah, I love her.

890
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,582
Then why were you
gonna get a divorce?

891
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:56,008
- How do you know that?
- It's in the statement you made

892
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,927
that night to the cops, Alan.

893
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,890
I don't just accept
a case as it comes along.

894
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:07,227
I do my research. Always.
What did you expect?

895
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,188
Now tell me about your wife.

896
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,317
Tell me about Cynthia, Alan.
Go ahead.

897
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,864
She was sick. She was very sick.

898
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,741
- She wasn't--
- I can't hear you, Alan.

899
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,576
It was really hard to be around her.

900
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:26,163
- Her temper, the illness.
- Helzer: I can't hear you.

901
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,123
She used to scream at the kids--

902
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,750
- Helzer: I can't hear you.
- She would scream at the kids.

903
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,919
- She was not a good mother.
- Speak up, for Christ's sake,

904
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,631
why don't you?
I can't hear a word you're saying!

905
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,508
- The illness changed her!
- I can't hear you!

906
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:42,846
She was a whore, okay?
She was a fucking whore!

907
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,892
Fuck!

908
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,270
Fuck!

909
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,234
She was fucking--
she was wicked.

910
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,404
She was--

911
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,948
she would spend
several days at a time in bed,

912
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,534
without even the will to wash.

913
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:08,580
Or she would leave the house without
so much as a word of explanation.

914
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:13,126
I had to look after the kids.

915
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:16,463
I had to give up my job.

916
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:20,842
I had to-- I-- I--
I neglected the business,

917
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,762
and my daughter blamed me.

918
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,972
She said that mom didn't want

919
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,433
to come home because

920
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,686
I didn't make her happy.

921
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,232
She would come home stinking!

922
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:41,530
You know, I helped her to be sick.
I would help her.

923
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,283
I fucking-- I undressed her.
I put her in bed,

924
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:48,787
and I would call the school
the next day making up excuses.

925
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,462
I had to hide it from the kids.

926
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,507
You know, she lost her job.

927
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,926
They got rid of her.

928
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,684
And towards the end of it,
you know, she would--

929
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,270
she would shut herself off at home

930
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:17,274
and she would be on the phone
all day long to God knows who.

931
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:21,778
The house was a--
things couldn't go on like that.

932
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:29,411
I asked her to take her medication.
I begged her.

933
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:34,249
I threatened her.
I threatened her with--

934
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,252
I told her I wanted custody
of the kids.

935
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,841
I told her we were going
and she just--

936
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,180
she just laughed
with that twisted grimace.

937
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,767
She just fucking laughed at me.
She laughed.

938
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,396
And one day,

939
01:02:56,564 --> 01:03:00,776
Caitlin came home from school
and she went up to see her mother,

940
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,028
and she found her in bed.

941
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,533
She wasn't alone.

942
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:12,412
No, she--

943
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,207
Caitlin saw how she--

944
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,755
She saw how this fucking pig--

945
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,090
this-- how--

946
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:30,180
I got there a little bit later.
Later than I should have.

947
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,772
I saw everything.

948
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,447
I beat the shit out of the guy.

949
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,991
I fucking threw him out of the house.

950
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,455
I lost control.

951
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:59,084
I hit her.

952
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,920
I hit her once, just one time.

953
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,469
Caitlin was screaming.
She was screaming.

954
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,221
She was screaming.

955
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,224
She was begging for help.

956
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,643
She was trying to--

957
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:20,146
she was saying-- she was
screaming at me not to hurt mom.

958
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,857
- But I--
- Ellen: You killed her.

959
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,234
Helzer:
Ellen, please.

960
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,750
I left the house without looking back.

961
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,547
I grabbed the kids
and put 'em in the car, and...

962
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,843
I didn't want them to see that.

963
01:04:56,934 --> 01:05:00,520
I wanted to go to the ends
of the Earth. I wanted to disappear.

964
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:08,945
So we drove and we drove,
and we fucking drove.

965
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,365
Helzer:
And she chased you?

966
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,121
The police found us just after midnight.

967
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,460
My cell phone was off the entire time.

968
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,629
I had no--
I had no idea.

969
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,550
They said that she had...

970
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,056
wrapped her car around a tree.

971
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,818
Caitlin blamed me for everything.

972
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,740
She made me responsible
for the death of her mother.

973
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,746
She couldn't accept

974
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,165
who she was, what she was.

975
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,043
Has anybody examined your daughter?

976
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:10,298
White:
Examined her? Who? Why?

977
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,386
She has the onset of schizophrenia.

978
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,763
It's the same condition
her mother suffered from.

979
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,936
Caitlin, that's enough!

980
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:28,566
- Paul: Ellen, grab the other camera!
- Ellen: Are you okay?

981
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,528
- Caitlin: Dad!
- Ellen: Oh, my God.

982
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,321
- Dad!
- Paul: What are we looking at here?

983
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,823
Who's shouting?

984
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:39,494
White: Caitlin! Caitlin!

985
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,706
I'm coming! Caitlin!

986
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:49,004
I'm coming!

987
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,381
Helzer:
I'm right behind you.

988
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,342
White: Caitlin!

989
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,262
Paul:
What the hell is going on, Doctor?

990
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,348
What is this shit?

991
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,434
Helzer:
Remain calm. Mr. White!

992
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,936
- White: Caitlin!
- Helzer: Don't panic. Don't panic.

993
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,981
White: Caitlin!

994
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,233
Caitlin, honey,
what's happening to you?

995
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,235
Paul:
The camera.

996
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,154
- White: Caitlin.
- Helzer: That's not me, guys.

997
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,197
Caitlin: Dad!

998
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:20,118
- Caitlin!
- Help, Dad, please!

999
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:24,330
- Dad, help! Help!
- I'm coming. I'm coming!

1000
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:27,917
Almost there, sweetie,
don't worry. Caitlin!

1001
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,586
Helzer: Mr. White!

1002
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:33,715
- I'm coming!
- Helzer: Mr. White!

1003
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,552
- Mr. White!
- Hold on, baby!

1004
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,223
- Dad, help me. Dad, help me!
- Caitlin!

1005
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,601
- Daddy!
- Paul: Watch out!

1006
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:48,855
You're gonna be fine.
I'm right behind you.

1007
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,815
Paul:
Shit!

1008
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,651
- Caitlin!
- Dad, help!

1009
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,833
Paul: Ellen!

1010
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,294
Helzer:
She's fine. Ellen's fine. Keep going.

1011
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,421
Paul:
Ellen, are you okay?

1012
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,132
She's fine, Paul.
Keep going.

1013
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:20,720
Keep moving, Mr. White!

1014
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:26,518
Caitlin, honey, I'm here.

1015
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,827
Mr. White!

1016
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:49,833
Paul:
Step aside, Doc.

1017
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,876
Holy shit!

1018
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:04,055
Help Mr. White!

1019
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:06,641
Caitlin!

1020
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:17,318
White: Caitlin, I'm here!

1021
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,445
White:
Look at me. I'm here.

1022
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,531
I can't move!

1023
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,867
Daddy, help me! Dad!

1024
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:26,286
- Caitlin, honey!
- Please, Dad!

1025
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:28,663
Daddy, help me.
I can't move!

1026
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,958
Paul, keep filming!

1027
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:35,253
- Caitlin: No, no! Help me!
- Honey, I'm here!

1028
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:39,424
Paul, keep filming!

1029
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:43,428
- Caitlin!
- Help, I can't move!

1030
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,597
Caitlin!

1031
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,183
- Help! Help!
- Caitlin!

1032
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,268
- Helzer: Mr. White!
- Daddy, help me!

1033
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,645
- Hold on, baby!
- Daddy, help!

1034
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:55,440
- Help me! Help me, please!
- Caitlin!

1035
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,776
Caitlin! Caitlin!

1036
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:08,995
Caitlin! Caitlin!

1037
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,456
Honey!

1038
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:22,342
Caitlin!

1039
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,723
Caitlin!

1040
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,364
Ellen: I'm gonna go to the hospital.

1041
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,408
I wanna make sure Caitlin's okay.

1042
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:30,660
You should come, too.
Someone should have a look at that arm.

1043
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,370
- I'll be fine.
- Ellen: You sure?

1044
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,373
- Okay.
- Paul: Okay, bye.

1045
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,527
Strange day, Doc.

1046
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,571
The strangest day of my life.

1047
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:10,241
With a possible exception or two.

1048
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,799
You know, I've been thinking.

1049
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,804
I've been lost all along, Doc.

1050
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:34,557
I mean, quite frankly,

1051
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:38,394
I don't even think Ellen knew.

1052
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:40,313
How did you know what was happening?

1053
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,732
Like, how soon did you know?

1054
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,859
Honestly?

1055
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:48,363
I probably knew the moment
we walked through the door, sort of.

1056
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,991
But we had to examine
every possible hypothesis

1057
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,161
to get to the truth.
We're scientists.

1058
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:59,290
We're not attorneys or psychics.

1059
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,668
- I am so tired, Paul.
- Oh, my God.

1060
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:06,172
I wish I was your age, but I'm not.

1061
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,674
Let's go.

1062
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:12,053
I'm not that young.
I just wanna put that out there.

1063
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,014
Helzer: The girl had a medical profile
suggesting a tendency

1064
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:17,016
towards schizophrenia...

1065
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:20,311
...which was easy enough
to connect to the mother's illness.

1066
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:24,273
Recent events coupled
with an unassimilated sexual awakening,

1067
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:27,443
which made her feel guilty
and dirty as deep down

1068
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:30,196
she sensed her own mother to be,

1069
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:33,116
amounted to a cocktail
she couldn't digest.

1070
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,119
Paul: Do you think
the girl's gonna be okay?

1071
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:38,204
Some people think of a poltergeist

1072
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:42,667
like a liberating psychological
mechanism, you know?

1073
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,919
Paul:
I never thought of it that way.

1074
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,548
I tend to think of it
as a way of not changing.

1075
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:50,716
Listen, I'm just gonna come back
tomorrow with Ellen to clean up,

1076
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:53,594
because right now
I just wanna get the hell out of here.

1077
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,097
I don't care where I go.

1078
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,399
- Hold on a second, Paul.
- Yeah.

1079
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:08,109
That camera's cold, distant view

1080
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,069
is gonna be the last witness
of our failure.

1081
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,572
After all, we weren't able
to prevent anything.

1082
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:14,490
You want me to turn it off?

1083
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:17,285
No, leave it for the police.
They're gonna want to see it all.

1084
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,247
Where are you heading?
You need a lift?

1085
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,500
I'm going to the police station
before they come looking for me.

1086
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:27,712
Paul: Man, I love cops.

1087
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:32,133
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.

1088
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,802
- You're welcome.
- You know what, Paul?

1089
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,472
- I'm hungry. I'm really, really hungry.
- Paul: Yeah.

1090
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,807
Helzer: Maybe the police can wait
after all. What do you think?

1091
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:43,060
Paul: Absolutely. I know
the perfect place. Not far from here.

1092
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,646
The burgers are terrible.
The fries are worse.

1093
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,815
The pie is decent.

1094
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,776
Helzer: Sounds like a plan.
First the burger, then we'll see.

1095
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:54,071
One step at a time, Paul.
One step at a time.
