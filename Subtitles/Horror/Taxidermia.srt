1
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,120
- Morosgoványi!
- Yes, Lieutenant!

2
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,880
What day is it today, Morosgoványi?

3
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Saturday, Lieutenant.

4
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,160
Second Saturday.

5
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,600
Bathing Saturday, Lieutenant.

6
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,520
What are the duties of an orderly
on a bathing Saturday, Morosgoványi?

7
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,840
I humbly report, he is obliged
to set up the trough

8
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,200
that serves as a bath tub,
in the kitchen

9
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,480
that is appropriately heated
and propped up

10
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,800
at four... six points,

11
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,200
then to fill it up with water
that has been boiled

12
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,200
to the correct temperature
from the pot outside,

13
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,600
according to demand and person.

14
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,080
And what makes the water boil,
Morosgoványi?

15
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,120
I humbly report,
the fire does and this has to be...

16
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,200
laid in the fireplace outside
in east-south-

17
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
easterly direction...

18
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,440
This is after?

19
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,920
After the wood has been chopped
to the correct size.

20
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,320
The correct size is?

21
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,560
Twenty, five, five...

22
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,680
Centimetres.

23
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,120
This is after...?

24
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,560
After the Lieutenant's
been accompanied out...

25
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,920
After...?

26
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,280
After the bicycle tires
have been pumped...

27
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,880
- After...?
- After the toilet's been scrubbed...

28
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
- After...?
- The muck's been carried out...

29
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,120
- After...?
- The straw's been carried in...

30
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,520
The other way around, Morosgovány,
the other way around.

31
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
Yes, the other way around!

32
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,480
This is after...?

33
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,000
- The Lieutenant's buttons
have been polished. - After...?

34
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,960
The daily field exercise
has been completed.

35
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,920
After...?

36
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
After the pig has been fed.

37
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,240
Quite right.

38
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,200
And?

39
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,960
What is it that the orderly never does,
Morosgoványi?

40
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,880
I humbly report, under no
circumstances does he peep.

41
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
Because if he peeps?

42
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,880
- His big mouth will be shot off!
- His harelip! Morosgoványi.

43
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes indeed, Lieutenant!

44
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
Hang on... hang on!

45
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,160
Too much, too much, too much!

46
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,880
Hang on! Hang on!

47
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,720
Just a drop more...

48
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,240
Good, good. Too much, too much!

49
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,560
Now, get out!

50
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,760
Don't you have
anything better to do? Get out!

51
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,320
And what are you smiling at?

52
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
What's true is true.

53
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,920
The poet was right.

54
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,120
For what, I ask,
does a man's dick stand erect?

55
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,080
Who knows that?

56
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,160
- Don't you think, Morosgoványi?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

57
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,520
And so I ask you straight,
Morosgoványi...

58
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,640
is there anything better
than the cunt of a woman?

59
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,960
Because you can call it
what you like...

60
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,680
...the cunt is still the common
denominator...

61
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,360
Isn't it?

62
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,280
And if it's not,

63
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,880
it's because it's not,

64
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
or because it's ugly...

65
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
I mean the word...

66
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,880
or unwashed, I mean.

67
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,240
- Or like a pig.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

68
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,000
For, I quite agree

69
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,080
that a poet's description
of a love chalice

70
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,600
is more beautiful...

71
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,520
Or a dewy lilly.

72
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,200
Or perhaps a pussy...

73
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,320
No doubt about that.

74
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,360
Or in the words of the song.
How does it go?

75
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,840
<i>If you were a rosebud, a rosebud,
I would be a bee.</i>

76
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,040
<i>I'd buzz up to you...</i>

77
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,520
But that's just how they say it.

78
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,640
When courting or being polite.

79
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,320
Because all they are
really saying is "cunt".

80
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,200
Do you understand?

81
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,560
The cunt, yes!

82
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,000
Because, listen, Vendel...

83
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I've got my own theory

84
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,520
that it's not the world
that makes cunt go around,

85
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,360
but it's cunt that makes
the world go around...

86
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,480
Erno, lunch is ready!

87
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you going on about?
Go and find something to do!

88
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,080
Leona! Now! I've had enough!

89
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,480
Not now! You're it!

90
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,760
Leona, come on, run, Leona!

91
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,400
Come on, come on, throw it then!

92
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,200
Girls!

93
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,840
Bedtime!

94
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,880
Girls!

95
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,200
Into bed, one, two.

96
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,160
Miss!

97
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,640
Sleep well.

98
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,400
Don't worry about your figure,

99
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,200
just grow nice and fat for me.

100
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,200
Sweet dreams!

101
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:53,680
<i>There is a poor, orphan girl...</i>

102
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,600
<i>She doesn't have a mother or father
to love her.</i>

103
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,840
<i>She has a friend, loneliness</i>

104
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,640
<i>and she washes clothes in the stream</i>

105
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,480
<i>morning and night</i>

106
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,960
<i>Her stepmother shouts at her
and beats her</i>

107
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:38,520
<i>Poor orphan, her life is miserable.</i>

108
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:51,880
<i>The little girl washes a white dress
in the little stream.</i>

109
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,920
HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN:
THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL

110
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,400
Don't be afraid of me.

111
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,960
But you're trembling.

112
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,480
Shall I magic
stars for you in the sky?

113
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,560
Yes.

114
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,640
- Would you like that?
- Yes.

115
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,880
You really want me to?

116
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,480
- Yes.
- Millions of tiny stars...

117
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,240
But you have to help me.

118
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,600
Give me your hand.

119
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,680
Yes, there.

120
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,640
I'm flying!

121
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,400
Here you are! My dear Leona!

122
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,880
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

123
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
To the final victory!

124
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,520
Cheers! Cheers!

125
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,400
Hey, where are you?

126
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,800
Here, Morosgoványi.
The candle supply.

127
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,160
Morosgoványi!

128
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,600
But won't you get cold, Mistress,
out of bed like this?

129
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,720
That only depends on you,
Vendel,

130
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,000
on how skilful you are.

131
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,320
Scratch me, Morosgoványi,

132
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,760
scratch me!

133
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:24,960
Keep scratching.

134
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,840
Are you undressing me, silly boy?

135
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,800
It's winter...

136
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,600
A woman can't afford to catch
a chill with her equipment,

137
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,920
you know, Morosgoványi. A woman
needs a lot of warmth, a lot.

138
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,760
Oh, yes. You.

139
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,720
Wait, I 'm going to throw
my guts up, hey.

140
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,640
I'm going to fuck you, Irma.

141
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,480
Can I say things like that?

142
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,400
Sure I can, damn it!

143
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,000
Fuck my cunt,
shove your prick right up.

144
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,520
Fuck my cunt,
shove your prick right up.

145
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,880
My little mangalica piggy.

146
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,120
My little mangalica,

147
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,480
my little pig,

148
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,120
my sow,

149
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,880
my piggy!

150
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,480
Tell me, Ferike, Leona,

151
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Vilma.
Tell me, Irmuska, you, you, you!

152
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,960
Let's shriek together.

153
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,680
And let's laugh and

154
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,160
let's grunt,
because life's too short.

155
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,960
And get it in,

156
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,040
get it in,

157
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,680
get it in!

158
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,800
As hard as you can!

159
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,760
Morosgoványi...

160
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Yes, Lieutenant!

161
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,360
Little Kálmán, my little son!

162
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,480
...and now, at this very moment,

163
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,600
if we can believe the scales,
and why shouldn't we?

164
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Our boy Kálmán Balatony
is moving into second place

165
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,360
behind Hristo Mehmedov

166
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,400
who's in position 2, so he's
only behind by a fraction

167
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,960
Ivan Duharin,
Soviet world champion...

168
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,480
Come on, come on!
You've got second!

169
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,440
...then Béla Miszlényi,
in a phenomenal fourth place!

170
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,160
The contender from of the 12th Regiment
of the Bulgarian Liberation Front

171
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,840
is keeping up
with the two Hungarians.

172
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,520
It's still impossible to tell
what the final result will be.

173
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,320
We know, who the winner will be,
but there is an incredible chase

174
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,360
for the second, third
and fourth place!

175
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,600
Colonel Ivan Duharin,
is now in first place,

176
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,080
followed by Kálmán Balatony
in the colours of Honvéd.

177
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,120
Come on Kálmán, come on Honvéd!
Then Hristo Mehmedov,

178
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,720
followed by Béla Miszlényi.
After him...

179
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Come on Hungarians,

180
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,040
come on Hungarians!

181
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
Come on Balatony!

182
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,320
Come on Miszlényi!

183
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,160
Come on Hungarians,
come on Hungarians!

184
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,760
Will Balatony be able to keep
his very shaky second place?

185
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,760
Of course he will,
58 seconds to go,

186
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,840
he's putting on an amazing finish.

187
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,720
And so is Miszlényi.

188
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,760
Miszlényi is third,
Balatony is 0.2 behind Duharin...

189
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,880
Only 0.1! Is he...?
No, he isn't.

190
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,440
You like her, don't you?

191
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,040
Leave her alone!

192
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,040
- You kept looking at her.
- I'm second all the same.

193
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,120
Because I pushed you.

194
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,360
Ah, Chick!

195
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,480
This competition
is more important than that.

196
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,000
This woman is going to be my wife.

197
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,800
Are you crazy?
You don't even know her.

198
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,120
What the fuck are you looking at
all the time?

199
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,320
You know where you are, Chick? No?

200
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,400
Then look out there to see
where you're standing.

201
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,440
At a turning point.
And you still fuck it up?

202
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,080
Is it worth anything to you
if you're second? Norway!

203
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,640
- Are you crazy?
- I'm second. - But how?

204
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,720
By a thread. Shut your face.

205
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,520
Just stare into your plate and eat!
It's not soup anymore.

206
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,880
You eat some false tooth or ring
or something and that's it.

207
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,880
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes.

208
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,800
I should think so.

209
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,320
Now, the lipid.
It's dry, dangerous

210
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,880
and full of shit like
gauze and wadding.

211
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,360
Only a little lubricant,
enough for three regurgitations.

212
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,800
Do I make myself clear?

213
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,960
Béla.

214
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,800
Béla, you keep up with Kálmán.
And keep an eye on the Russian!

215
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,800
It's good for you, too.
The Soviet's first and we're second.

216
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,800
Go, Honvéd! Go Hungarians!

217
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,680
The Vasilyev move worked and
the Garmeyer cross-swallow.

218
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,840
I don't know what his problem is.

219
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,280
The Garmeyer cross-swallow?
With bean soup?

220
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,400
You didn't even notice, did you?

221
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,200
And why not? Because the pacemaker
was watching the woman too!

222
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,080
I'm telling you,
you can be only third,

223
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,680
and only the champion
can take the women's champion.

224
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,920
All right. The champion
gets the women's champion!

225
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,120
Welcome to the Spartakiad.
We welcome

226
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,520
Comrade Gizella Aczél who competes
for the canning factory and

227
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,000
won the Junior World Championship
in Cuba in "sausage and beans".

228
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,200
And another international champion
in sport eating:

229
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,800
Comrade Bat Bulgana from Mongolia

230
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,640
who took gold in Beijing
in "hard-boiled eggs".

231
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,760
To your plates,

232
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,880
get set,

233
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
go!

234
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,120
And the fight has started
in the second course.

235
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,040
The two Hungarians are right
behind the Spartacus star.

236
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,960
The stakes are high
in the second round

237
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,600
with horse sausage chosen by
the Soviets, who knows?

238
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,560
Go Hungarians!

239
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,880
Tempo! You're first, come on!
Let's go! Come on!

240
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,800
And I can't believe my eyes.

241
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,440
Balatony's scales are showing 23.5,

242
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,800
no, 23.7 less than Duharin's.

243
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,600
Yes, Balatony is winning!
A historic moment!

244
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,720
It's good to be Hungarian
in Kecskemét.

245
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,360
A milestone in Hungarian sport eating!

246
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,120
Come on Balatony!
Come on Miszlényi!

247
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,720
Come on Balatony!

248
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,800
The spoon, the spoon!

249
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,120
...they keep on eating
but Kálmán's stopped.

250
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,080
It looks like lockjaw!
The others just keep on going

251
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,600
as the clock eats up the last
few seconds. But Balatony! Kálmán!

252
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,720
Comrade! What are you doing?
You can still win. Come on!

253
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,600
Oh, there seems to be a problem...
It is lockjaw, I'm afraid.

254
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,400
Let me tell you,
Cuba is a Socialist paradise.

255
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,000
And there are oranges everywhere.

256
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,080
You don't have to queue,
they just drop from the trees.

257
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,280
Hello, hello.

258
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,920
How are you, son, how are you?
You're getting your colour back...

259
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,960
Hello, you cheat!

260
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,360
Tinned strawberries.

261
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,920
Your favourite.

262
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,080
- Béla Miszlényi.
- Gizella Aczél. Congratulations.

263
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,320
I've heard so much about you,
Comrade Aczél.

264
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,720
I respect your results. If you
have results, you have everything.

265
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,000
Béla came second, after Duharin.

266
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,160
And this has its own consequences.

267
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,280
I hear, it's Norway.

268
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,600
Norway. They'll put me forward
for the European championship.

269
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,840
The most important thing is
that you're in one piece.

270
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,200
I can tell you this,
as one champion to another.

271
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,680
Isn't that right, Kálmán?

272
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,120
I brought some bananas.
Good and soft.

273
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,920
Nice.

274
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,240
- Do you want some, Comrade?
- No thanks.

275
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,640
Are you not coming, Comrade?

276
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,920
My car's outside, I can give you
a lift if you like.

277
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,000
Or you want to chat, Kalmán?

278
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,800
All right, my boy.
Don't let yourself go!

279
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,080
So then, good bye, Kálman.

280
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,120
Get well soon.

281
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,280
Bride for sale!

282
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,280
Faster, gentlemen, faster!

283
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,840
Come on, don't be mean!

284
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,120
Smile, Matyi, it's a wedding,
not a funeral!

285
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,120
Bride for sale!

286
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,480
Faster, Matyi, faster!

287
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,120
Have you grown roots or what!

288
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,480
Thank you, Juliska!

289
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,760
Laci, my old mate,
put the money in here.

290
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,680
Hey, don't take it out, put it in!

291
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,240
Bride for sale!

292
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,960
Let's run away!

293
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,520
Sure.

294
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,320
The bride's running away!

295
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,200
- Béla?
- Béla.

296
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,960
That fucking liar!

297
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,680
- Where is he?
- Not so fast.

298
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,040
It must be worked for, my boy.

299
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,680
First test: singing.

300
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,440
No you don't.

301
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,120
Norway.

302
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,600
Come with me.

303
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,520
I want you, Gizi.

304
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,960
I want to spend my life with you.

305
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,040
I love you, Gizi.

306
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:08,040
<i>It cannot be the time for farewell,</i>

307
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:16,240
<i>I only had you, no one else.</i>

308
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,560
<i>You took my dreams,</i>

309
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,560
<i>I still see your face.</i>

310
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,280
<i>A painful thought is haunting me:</i>

311
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,280
<i>Will you think of me,
when the night is over?</i>

312
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,240
<i>All our dreams are torn...</i>

313
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,560
We can go to Norway, Gizi!

314
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,520
Gizi! You're mine, Gizi!

315
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,440
I won you, Gizi!

316
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,400
Norway!

317
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:04,520
<i>And you have never loved
anyone like me.</i>

318
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:13,200
<i>Will you think of me,
when the night is over...</i>

319
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,960
<i>Don't tear all our dreams apart.</i>

320
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,280
<i>Lie that it hurts,
that it still hurts.</i>

321
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,920
Pista, Józsi, move!

322
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,200
Pali, don't just sit there!
Get to the machine!

323
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,240
Just how are you holding that hose?

324
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,080
Excuse me.

325
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,400
Good afternoon.
Comrade Szakacs said...

326
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,880
It's arranged.

327
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,040
Sit over there.

328
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,000
Menu: dessert, semolina pudding.

329
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
You get cocoa powder on it.

330
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,040
Sit up!

331
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,480
Spoons up.

332
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,360
You too!

333
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,920
Your spoon?

334
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,840
Marks, get set, go!

335
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,560
Semolina, mushy,

336
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,640
lumpy.

337
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,800
Don't forget to work your elbows.
Go for the cross-swallow.

338
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,960
Come on, ten seconds left.

339
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,160
Finished!

340
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,400
Oh, I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

341
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,080
Kiril Gottman.

342
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,720
Kzystof Dihar.

343
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,960
Jan Beher Kekes.

344
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
Béla Miszlényi.

345
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,080
I can't!

346
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,200
This is a totally different world.

347
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,320
It needs a different personality.

348
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,960
Listen to this, listen to that!
Do it like this, then like that!

349
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,800
Then the Bulgarians and
Soviets take everything.

350
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,280
- And Béla Miszlényi.
- I don't give a shit about him!

351
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,080
They gave him everything.

352
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,040
"Mister Miszlényi, please".

353
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,680
Throat expansion.

354
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,080
Where are we compared to them,

355
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,920
Chick?

356
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,120
Do you remember, Uncle Jeno?

357
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,440
With the Inota chocolate bar,

358
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,960
at the fluid stage, to be precise,

359
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,320
it was neither shaped nor cut.
Still hot.

360
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,720
I was in the sixth grade, I think.

361
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,160
The man in the factory told us
we could eat as much as we wanted

362
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,920
but not to put any
into our pockets or bags.

363
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,200
There was a girl, Ibolya,

364
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,480
I wanted to impress her.

365
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,800
I wanted to show that I was
good at something and

366
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
there are other things than
climbing a rope or singing.

367
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,760
"Can you give me a spoon
and soda", I asked.

368
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,440
I just counted to myself.

369
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,840
It was about 2.2 kilos
for the first round.

370
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,720
That was when I got the first buzz.

371
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,440
This trembling excitement

372
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,400
that my capacity is bigger than me.

373
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,720
The feeling that you are growing
bigger and bigger inside,

374
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,600
and deep and unknown chambers
open up.

375
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,480
Just a slip of a boy, Uncle Jeno,

376
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,080
and I still had the right feeling.

377
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,760
I wanted to bet him
200 cognac cherries,

378
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,760
they were a rarity then,
all went for export.

379
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,520
We didn't have them,
not even at Christmas.

380
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,000
But he said it was over,
and we had to leave.

381
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,320
"You're a fucking liar!"
I said to him. He didn't dare hit me.

382
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,040
He called the guard.

383
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,240
And what did I say?

384
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,040
That I should leave those losers
at Kinizsi Meat.

385
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,880
And that there'd be money
for the tram home

386
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,280
and a small snack after
competitions - sandwiches, juice...

387
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,520
I say the same right now.

388
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,400
And no bullshit.

389
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,560
You've got to work like hell!
Keep practicing!

390
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,400
When speed eating comes
into fashion again,

391
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,000
and the IOC admits it at last,

392
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,160
then we'll show the world

393
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,400
that Kálmán Balatony s a

394
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,200
real gem.

395
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,440
Dear Comrade Gizella, welcome to
our hospital. Our most modern ward

396
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,920
is named after the wife of the martyr
Tibor Szamuely. This is gynaecology.

397
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,480
Our doctors are patient and
the examination is painless.

398
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,360
- The staff are all excellent...
- That's important.

399
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,880
So, Comrade Gizella...

400
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,640
we transfer you
to vegetable wholesale.

401
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,760
You'll need to pee and we'll take
some blood, all right?

402
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,760
Congratulations!

403
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,560
You know, doctor,
there is a small problem...

404
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,360
Vegetable wholesale.

405
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,640
Yes, but Gizi competes
for the canning factory.

406
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,560
Vegetable wholesale.

407
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,320
- They're second division.
- With no calorie allowance.

408
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,360
No way. Internal order.
Pregnant women must transfer.

409
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,880
- Cyst or myoma?
- Cyst! - Myoma!

410
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,320
Tibor...

411
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,040
Ilonka...

412
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,280
János...

413
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,320
Or Piroska...

414
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,560
Or Miklós...

415
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,440
Lajos!

416
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,520
Comrade Aczél!

417
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,160
Gizike!

418
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,960
They said I'd find you here.

419
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,440
Comrade Svigadurin
would like to invite

420
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,320
our famous sportswoman and
her husband to join us onboard.

421
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,440
And the situation is...

422
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,320
well... you know... it was sort
of announced that...

423
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,720
You should give a short...

424
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,720
demonstration...

425
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,720
45 kg of red caviar,

426
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,040
in 20 minutes

427
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,760
in honour of the 20th anniversary
of the liberation.

428
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,760
The first minute is over.

429
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,520
So 45 kilos in 20 minutes,
do you understand?

430
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,320
I don't know,
but my stomach feels very odd.

431
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,240
No wonder after vomiting so much.

432
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,120
But I'm sweating
like Ili Fibinger in Parliament.

433
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,600
Don't be silly, that was
something totally different.

434
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,640
Goose liver got stuck in her throat,
poor thing.

435
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,960
I don't know,
something is definitely not right.

436
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,160
Hey, are you crying? You?
The canning factory champion?

437
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,000
Listen.

438
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,120
What about the time with
Fidel Castro and the soup? Hmm?

439
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,280
That great man clapped so hard,

440
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,640
he nearly fell off the podium.

441
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,000
All right, I'll tell the doctor
to stop everything.

442
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,440
Health is more important.

443
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,720
But we'll lose the trip to Sochi.

444
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,880
Come on, pull yourself together.
Wait, I'll blow down!

445
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,440
Dear Comrades...

446
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,240
now, more than ever,

447
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,680
we need helping hands to strengthen

448
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,800
the construction of communism...

449
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,280
now, when the most important issues
are real friendship

450
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,160
and honest brotherhood,

451
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,800
I thank you for this commemoration.

452
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,880
Are you OK, pussycat?

453
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,920
Have a drop of cognac!

454
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,400
It hasn't happened
since I was a junior.

455
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,400
That one, on the left,
in the top row.

456
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,320
- Is that little Lajos?
- Yeah, he's beautiful.

457
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,680
- A bit small though...
- It doesn't matter!

458
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,880
A child is a child.

459
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,840
We'll bring him up, pussycat.

460
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,680
LAJOS BALATONY - TAXIDERMIST

461
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,240
Thirty kilos of margarine
and 800 Champion Bars.

462
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,240
And this lolly...

463
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,960
- When do you finish today?
- 38,526.

464
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,440
- Are you here tomorrow?
- Ten bread rolls?

465
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,200
Move your arse!
What are you doing there?

466
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,800
Is that 15 kilos?

467
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,160
Don't spare any!

468
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,040
Margarine.
Sticky, oily vegetable fat.

469
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,800
Come on, start eating.

470
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,680
Hurry up, Gréta, what is it then?

471
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,480
Chew faster.
Watch out for the cross-swallow.

472
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,080
They should be able to eat the...

473
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,360
15 kilos by now.

474
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,440
This was well worth it.

475
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,360
She's really coming on!

476
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,000
All the hard work
is starting to pay off.

477
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,600
At least on those
who put some effort in.

478
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,760
But you,
I can't even look at you.

479
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,160
- Then don't look.
- Sure I won't.

480
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,440
These little things
are the apples of my eye.

481
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,200
I'd give anything just to stroke
those little hairy bellies!

482
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
Oh, you are beautiful.

483
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,080
Youuuuu!

484
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,120
Come on, let them out,
just for a minute!

485
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,720
No way.

486
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,640
Later.

487
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,680
I'll open it later. You'll see.

488
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,280
If it snaps,

489
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,120
if notice it snap,

490
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,080
I'll have a wash, clean myself

491
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,320
and open the door for Gizike.

492
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,800
You'd have to get up for that.

493
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,040
You'll see.

494
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,960
You watching that shit again?

495
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,680
The losers.

496
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,800
If only I were there!

497
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,720
- Can you believe it?
- Yeah, probably.

498
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,520
Arseholes.

499
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,760
Losers.

500
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,600
Gorging.

501
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,000
Arseholes.

502
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,000
I'd be a whatsit by now.

503
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,840
A, you know...

504
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,800
A world star.

505
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,680
But you won't make a fool out of me!

506
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,320
Who?

507
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,480
- Should I heat the meat up?
- Los Angeles?

508
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,360
- I've never been there.
- And you're not likely to...

509
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,240
But the Romanians went,
all the same.

510
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,040
Just look at this!

511
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,480
- Can I help you?
- Good afternoon.

512
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,240
I've got something.
I was told to come to you.

513
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,000
Wild or domestic?

514
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,400
Not really sure...

515
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,400
domestic, I guess.

516
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,840
Your name?

517
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,960
Regoczy.

518
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,760
Andor Regoczy.

519
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,000
Doctor.

520
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,200
How much is this?

521
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,720
It's not for sale.

522
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,040
38,526.

523
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,720
Only if you keep the schedule.

524
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,920
No meat until then.

525
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,880
Everything in its own time.

526
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,880
Black pudding

527
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,080
or industrial lard.

528
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,640
Well, if you don't eat Lajoska
before then,

529
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,480
though there's not much on him.

530
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,720
My little kittens.

531
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,960
All right,

532
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
grow nice and big.

533
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,960
You're my world sensation.

534
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,120
You could even be on television.

535
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,360
Sure you could.

536
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,400
If there was somebody

537
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,000
who'd arrange it! Right?

538
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,600
Clever girl, Gizi.

539
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,520
I myself started with fat.

540
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,840
- A long time back.
- And that's how it should be.

541
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,200
Come on, kitty,

542
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,200
eat it.

543
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,320
Maybe if you took the wrapper off...

544
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,320
Watch this!

545
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,440
Can you see?

546
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,280
And the silver paper?

547
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,640
It just slips down.

548
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,920
I can do 400 plain bars an hour

549
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:18,120
but 570 with the silver paper on.

550
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,920
- And does it come out?
- It gets absorbed.

551
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,560
I've never eaten anything that
should get absorbed and didn't.

552
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,920
It finds a role in the body.

553
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,840
Now, listen.

554
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,000
Check the time.

555
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,200
Ah, I'm just wasting my breath.

556
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,760
Cyst.

557
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,360
What did you say?

558
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,960
- Dad? - Don't you realise that
I'm ashamed because of you?

559
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,120
Because of me?
And you make me puke!

560
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,320
- I've never done anything but...
for you! - Why do you come then?

561
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,920
You don't have to do me a favour!

562
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,000
Carcass stuffer!

563
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,720
Alright then.

564
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,440
That's enough.
I just wonder

565
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,840
how long you'd survive.
For how many days?

566
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,680
You'd die of hunger, together
with your stinking competition cats.

567
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,400
You'd drown in shit and filth!
You can't go to the loo

568
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,320
- by yourself. - I can manage.
You don't have to do me any favours.

569
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,480
How would you manage?
I'm curious! Under yourself?

570
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,840
Get lost, shoo.

571
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,760
You don't realize that there's
no one you haven't chased away.

572
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,080
Only me, I'm such a fucked up idiot.
I won't come anymore, for sure.

573
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Who else would pay for pile of food
that you and these cats get through?

574
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,760
You son of a bitch!

575
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,600
Mum was right.

576
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,560
She was right when she left.

577
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,400
She didn't want to stay
in your huge fat arse

578
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:00,440
and rot along with you.
Because everything rots here.

579
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,520
Everything. But I won't!

580
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,040
Remember that! Loser!
Do you understand?

581
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,880
I'll smash your face, you shit!
Who do you think you are?

582
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,360
- You loser.
- So what? You want to hit me?

583
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,680
Come and hit me then.

584
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,360
It's never too late.

585
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,800
A fatherly slap.

586
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,120
Once in your life. Come on then,

587
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,520
I'll let you!

588
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,840
You don't even deserve a slap,
you bastard!

589
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,160
You stinking sack of shit!

590
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,880
Don't you bullshit a world star.

591
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:48,800
Just for comparison:
Igor Vostongonov made it with 3:21...

592
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,480
- In '69...
- Still no reason to bullshit me!

593
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,400
You carcass stuffer!

594
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,440
You don't know who I am!
What I've been through!

595
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,520
I worked hard!
I worked hard for success!

596
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,920
Who are you kidding,
you little runt?

597
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,880
- I had a vomiting technique
named after me! - Drop dead!

598
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,440
Chick!

599
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,520
We've got an infrared cabin,

600
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,760
sauna and turbo solarium
in the basement.

601
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:30,240
The recreation room
is next to the fitness room.

602
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,440
We've got back massage,
ayurvedic hand and head massage,

603
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,800
Swedish, Thai and sports massage
as well as tailor-made...

604
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,960
So you need to repeat this exercise
twenty times.

605
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,880
You could do fewer.

606
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:51,400
Stop for a while and rest
if you're tired.

607
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,920
Try not to push it
too much at the start

608
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,440
but focus on your muscles
and breathing.

609
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,560
In, out.

610
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,240
Alright, very good.

611
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,120
Don't do it too hard,

612
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,480
you can slow down a bit.

613
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,160
Focus on your body,
feel your muscles.

614
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,320
This exercise is good for your
pecs and can do wonders.

615
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,480
You'll notice the difference

616
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,680
when you leave the gym.

617
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,880
Five more to go, and then finished.

618
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,040
Good, very good.

619
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,520
Slower,

620
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,120
try to keep the distance
between your arms.

621
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,000
Good.

622
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,520
Well done,
finished for today,

623
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,840
stop it now.

624
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,600
Stop.

625
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,680
38,526.

626
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,760
1,474 back.

627
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,280
Here you are.

628
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,040
Good bye!

629
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,360
Dad.

630
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,400
It's me.

631
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,680
I'm back.

632
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,800
Fuck you, Galamb,
what are you doing!

633
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,560
Well, Dad.
You'll look really good.

634
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,560
Excuse me.

635
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,600
Hey!

636
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,520
Excuse me...
