1
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:16,184
Welcome!

2
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:18,344
Dr Atherton, I presume?

3
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:20,504
Wait! Not so fast!

4
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:25,184
We're in a hurry, Mr Manley!
We depart immediately.

5
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:26,504
Miguel Higueras, our assistant.

6
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:28,144
Mucho gusto.

7
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:29,744
Muy bien. Sorry I'm late.

8
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:33,664
I was held up in Caracas with fever.

9
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:35,624
Be sick on your own time,
Mr Manley!

10
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:41,264
I want close-ups of each specimen,
the forest and tepuis.

11
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:42,464
The what?

12
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:47,984
A tepui is a mountain with species
isolated for millions of years.

13
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:50,264
Any man-eating dinosaurs?

14
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:54,104
Only Atherton!
We'll hit a new one today.

15
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:56,864
Great(!) Anybody ever get lost?

16
00:02:56,864 --> 00:03:04,544
It's said men who climb
to the "rain desert" never return.
But don't worry - we'll fly!

17
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,224
He friendly?

18
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:34,144
I hope so.
He's our guide. Stick close.

19
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,464
Veinticuatro!

20
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:04,544
24-Hour Ant.

21
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,304
They bite?

22
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:09,944
They kill, Mr Manley,
in sufficient numbers.

23
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:12,064
So do some of the frogs.

24
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:14,024
Don't touch any!

25
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:16,424
Great(!)

26
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:37,144
This is where we're going.

27
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,264
We land here, then walk down.

28
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:46,424
It's a sinkhole. Thousands of years
of water have torn away the rock.

29
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:21,704
It's deep, 2,000ft, and dark at the
bottom. You'll need flash equipment.

30
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:40,784
Atencion, muchachos!

31
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:45,704
Stegolepis. Nutritious enough
to live on for weeks.

32
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:47,584
Thanks, I'll pass!

33
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:49,064
Plants your speciality?

34
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:52,424
Identifying new insects and spiders.

35
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:56,744
Great, just what the world needs(!)
More bugs(!)

36
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,984
What's your speciality, Manley?

37
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:05,744
Football.

38
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:34,544
Vamos! Vamos!

39
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:46,024
No-one mentioned poison ants
and frogs, but a 2,000ft drop?!

40
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:48,344
This is for the equipment.

41
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:51,544
Our guide will show us another way.

42
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:53,984
Vamonos!

43
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:57,704
Mr Manley!

44
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:59,944
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

45
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:11,104
Que pasa?

46
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:13,064
No voy. No voy.

47
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,344
What's with him?

48
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:20,624
This is as far as he'll go.

49
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,264
What?

50
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,544
Here we are.

51
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:50,384
Careful.
Careful, watch your step, man.

52
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:59,744
Amazing! The air temperature's
dropped 10 degrees in 100m!

53
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:01,664
Not far. Down there.

54
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:06,464
INAUDIBLE

55
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:23,384
Arrgghh! Arrgghh!

56
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:32,864
Manley, you all right?

57
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:35,624
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

58
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:38,624
HE SPEAKS IN SPANISH

59
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:40,904
What'd he say?

60
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:45,344
Be careful. You're too big
for us to carry out. Vamonos!

61
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:21,944
Wait up! Wait up!

62
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:53,024
What's that thing do?

63
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:56,504
Ever thrown a firecracker
into a pond?

64
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:58,664
Maybe when I was a kid. Why?

65
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,344
What happened?

66
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:03,424
All sorts of stuff floated
to the surface.

67
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:05,864
Exactly. Everybody ready?

68
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:12,224
ENGINE WHIRS NOSILY

69
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:41,144
Prepare yourselves, gentlemen.

70
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:43,664
For what?

71
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:02,624
For pictures, Manley!

72
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,664
What is it?

73
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:23,144
I think it's a new species
of butterfly.

74
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:26,024
We could call it Photius Manlii.

75
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:30,944
LARGE THUD

76
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:43,064
Extraordinary!
Look at these markings!

77
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:45,104
Don't just sit there!

78
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,504
Are you sure it's dead?

79
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:49,544
Yes. Quite dead.

80
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:01,024
Two more.

81
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:06,224
Highly unusual. So many spiders
this size in a confined area!

82
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:07,184
Look at the abdomen.

83
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,584
We must find a live specimen!

84
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:15,704
HE SCREAMS

85
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:19,064
HISSING

86
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:20,264
What the devil are you doing?

87
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:21,224
It was alive!

88
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:23,024
Don't be ridiculous.

89
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:24,584
It's just a spider...

90
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,744
It wasn't just a spider.

91
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:32,384
It was potentially a species
unchanged for millions of years...

92
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,184
and all you could do is squash it.

93
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:36,944
Profesor! No esta muerto.

94
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:39,064
HE MURMURS IN SPANISH

95
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:41,104
No esta muerto.

96
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:44,024
Impossible. They should be dead.

97
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:49,304
Very aggressive! We'll take two
alive, and preserve two.

98
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,144
Are you sure that'll do it?

99
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:14,024
This stuff will kill an elephant.

100
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:17,504
Millions of years,
then we come along!

101
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:22,544
How long will it take to get back?

102
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:27,424
What's wrong?
Still worried about dinosaurs(?)

103
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:29,504
This place gives me the creeps.

104
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:40,024
Incredible!

105
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:41,264
What is?

106
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:44,504
They have no reproductive organs.

107
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:48,344
Almost like worker bees
or soldier ants.

108
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:54,824
Well...if these are the soldiers,
I'd hate to see the general!

109
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:55,624
How are you feeling?

110
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:58,664
Like hell. This fever's killing me.

111
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:01,784
You don't look so good. Take a rest.

112
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,264
Ow!

113
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:13,904
HE CHOKES

114
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:28,304
STRANGLED CRIES

115
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,664
Senor!

116
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,304
Senor!

117
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:52,664
Profesor! Profesor! Profesor!

118
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:04,184
Esta muerto?

119
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:09,344
The fever.

120
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,104
Make sure we've got all his film.

121
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:16,784
Have we notified his family?

122
00:16:16,784 --> 00:16:20,624
I've contacted the US Consulate.

123
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,664
OK, seal him up.

124
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:25,064
HE SPEAKS SPANISH

125
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:02,504
I wish you wouldn't complain
about my driving!

126
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:05,264
You're pushing it, that's all!

127
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:07,664
Take it easy! Wait a minute!

128
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:09,344
All right.

129
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:17,744
Can you give me a hand?

130
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:19,664
Oh, yeah.

131
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:23,384
Oh, gee...

132
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,144
Oh, God!

133
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:30,104
I think I'll go move the hearse.

134
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:50,024
I'm sorry to pester you
in this already difficult time.

135
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:57,464
I know we decided on an open casket,
but we should maybe reconsider.

136
00:18:57,464 --> 00:19:01,544
I'm not sure how they work
down in South America...

137
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:07,424
but let me say their preservation
methods differ from ours.

138
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:11,744
No, you'd be welcome
to come down and decide...

139
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:15,584
But in this difficult time,
I'm not sure I would...

140
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:22,544
You do have the option...we could
put a photo on top of the casket.

141
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:27,304
Yeah. The one you had
in the newspaper would be nice.

142
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:29,264
Yeah. Oh, good.

143
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:30,544
All right.

144
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:37,624
DOG WIMPERS

145
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:41,264
CAT MIAOWS

146
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:03,704
BIRD SCREECHES

147
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:14,264
OK, kids, stake out your rooms!

148
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:15,344
Give me that!

149
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,264
Shelley!

150
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:22,544
Oh, Ross, smell that air!

151
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:25,784
HE SNEEZES

152
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,344
Oh, God!

153
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:37,144
Before we find what broke
in the move and that the breakfront
doesn't fit in the dining room,

154
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:40,664
let's chant,
"We did the right thing".

155
00:20:40,664 --> 00:20:42,464
BOTH: We did the right thing.

156
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:43,544
For the kids.

157
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,344
For all of us.

158
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,704
Goodbye crime, goodbye grime.

159
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:50,984
Goodbye culture, goodbye friends...

160
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:58,064
Hey, Dad,
there's a dead bird over here!

161
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:04,424
Well, don't touch it! Just go
into the house and find your sister.

162
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,944
Ross, the town is yours!

163
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:12,944
You're THE doctor.
Is there a more respected figure?

164
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:16,424
Respect is fine,
but I want to be feared.

165
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:19,784
Easy with that! That's... Don't...

166
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:26,744
Don't want to agitate the sediments.
Chateau Margaux. 127 bucks a bottle.

167
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,664
Tasty, huh?

168
00:21:29,704 --> 00:21:32,264
At that price, who can drink it?

169
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:34,184
Goes in the basement.

170
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:38,504
I mean, the cellar.

171
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,464
The wine cellar.

172
00:21:48,184 --> 00:21:51,464
I need a big padlock,
protect my investment.

173
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:53,504
Dad! Dad!

174
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:54,704
What? What's wrong?

175
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:57,584
Behind the boxes, a spider!

176
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:58,064
A spider? OK.

177
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:59,944
It was ugly! This big!

178
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,984
Calm down!
You're in the country now.

179
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:05,984
OK? Let's go find that spider.

180
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:08,984
Let's find Mom to take care of it.

181
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:12,824
Honey, we're in the living room!
We need you to kill a spider.

182
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:15,064
All right. Where is it?

183
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:16,904
Over there on the box!

184
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,184
Killing a spider? Cool!

185
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:20,984
Bad luck to kill one in a new house!

186
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:22,664
Just made that up, dear?

187
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,784
OK. Everything's OK.

188
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:31,984
Oh, poor thing!

189
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,024
It's more scared than we are.

190
00:22:35,024 --> 00:22:36,824
Let's give it a home in the barn.

191
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:39,224
Yeah, good idea, Shell.

192
00:22:56,384 --> 00:22:59,144
How come you're not afraid
of bugs like Dad?

193
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,584
I'm not afraid of bugs, just...
Careful of rusty nails!

194
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:04,504
Dad, chill out!

195
00:23:04,504 --> 00:23:05,144
Right here.

196
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:06,104
Yeah!

197
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:09,104
There. OK?

198
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:20,144
You won't miss
being in the thick of things?

199
00:23:20,144 --> 00:23:25,184
Stars winking, crickets singing...
we ARE in the thick of things.

200
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:30,104
I mean work. Strokes from the boss.
Christmas bonuses.

201
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:35,504
Office politics. Caffeine.
Adrenaline. Steady income.

202
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:37,784
We'll be fine.

203
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:41,744
Between my severance and your
potential patients, we'll be fine.

204
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:45,344
When are you meeting Dr Metcalf?

205
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:49,064
Thursday. The old coot passes
the torch at 10 sharp.

206
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,784
Wait.

207
00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:56,504
We can unpack in the morning.

208
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:03,664
I have some Napoleon brandy
in the basement...cellar.

209
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:05,864
Ross, I'm exhausted.

210
00:24:05,864 --> 00:24:09,584
It's bad luck not to make love
in a new house.

211
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:13,184
You just made that up,
didn't you, dear(?)

212
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:45,704
I have terrific news. Well,
for my patients it's terrific...

213
00:24:45,704 --> 00:24:47,024
..my wife is less than thrilled.

214
00:24:47,024 --> 00:24:48,584
What's that, Dr?

215
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:51,184
I'm postponing retirement.

216
00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:55,184
I don't know for how long, but...

217
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:56,864
But?

218
00:24:56,864 --> 00:25:03,704
I realised there's only one thing
left to do when you retire...

219
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:09,464
.. and too many friends have done
that 6 months after giving up work.

220
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,024
But you...

221
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:16,184
When we spoke four months ago,
you assured me...

222
00:25:16,184 --> 00:25:24,344
I'm not ready to retire, Doctor!
And if my wife can't rush
me into it, you sure as hell can't!

223
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:40,784
Excuse me.

224
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:43,904
You got to feed the meter, partner.

225
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:46,664
Well, I was just leaving.

226
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:48,704
Hmm, a little late, though.

227
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:52,304
I do have medical plates.

228
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:58,264
Oh, right! You're that new doctor!

229
00:25:58,264 --> 00:25:59,384
Ross Jennings.

230
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:01,544
Sheriff Lloyd Parsons.

231
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:03,464
You're a Yale grad?

232
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:04,504
That's right, yeah.

233
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:06,104
Yeah!

234
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:09,464
Just a school, isn't it(?)

235
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:12,064
That's enough, Lloyd Parsons.

236
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:14,104
You're writing him a ticket!?

237
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:16,424
What're you doing?!

238
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:20,464
What the whole town ought to do!
Your ticker-tape parade!

239
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:21,944
That's littering, Miss Hollins!

240
00:26:21,944 --> 00:26:24,464
Lloyd's been
a bully since 5th grade.

241
00:26:24,464 --> 00:26:29,984
I know, I held him back!
Walk me to my automobile.

242
00:26:31,544 --> 00:26:34,304
Thanks! How'd you know who I was?

243
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:40,304
We're neighbours. I gave you
a standing ovation when you arrived.

244
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:44,024
Sam Metcalf only recently
gave up leeches.

245
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:46,544
He also gave up retirement!

246
00:26:46,544 --> 00:26:52,984
We came thinking I'd have
his patients, now I've none!

247
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:56,744
No, Dr Jennings! You have one!

248
00:27:01,544 --> 00:27:07,304
Look at this light! On the best day
in the city we didn't get this!

249
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:12,464
Maybe they'll give me a show.
They do that in little towns.

250
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:18,344
"Molly Jennings - A Retrospective."
I need to take pictures first!

251
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,264
There's good news and bad.

252
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,864
Shall we go in reverse alphabetical
order, start with the good?

253
00:27:23,864 --> 00:27:25,544
Mm-hm.

254
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:31,064
I'm seeing my first patient today...
A great old dame, lives up the road.

255
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:33,304
Terrific. What's the bad?

256
00:27:33,304 --> 00:27:35,344
She's my only patient.

257
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:38,024
Today?

258
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:45,344
Metcalf changed his mind.

259
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:46,544
What?

260
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:49,064
He panicked.

261
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:57,344
He says if he retires, he'll lose
his zest for life and die
within 48 hours or something.

262
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:01,184
But we looked
in 14 different towns!

263
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:05,144
We bought a house! You rented
an office! What'll we do?

264
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:06,824
Kill him?

265
00:28:08,744 --> 00:28:10,664
I have my fax machine.

266
00:28:10,664 --> 00:28:16,424
I'll work part-time. Phone and fax
is all I need. My old clients...

267
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:20,024
Honey, we'll be fine,
just like you said.

268
00:28:20,024 --> 00:28:21,104
With one patient?

269
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:25,664
Maybe I'll be lucky
and she'll be ravaged by disease.

270
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:28,784
Like having seven patients in one.

271
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:37,184
Fit as a fiddle!
Not a damned thing wrong!

272
00:28:37,624 --> 00:28:39,904
Dr Jennings, I'm sorry.

273
00:28:39,904 --> 00:28:44,104
Think I was hoping
you were ravaged by disease?

274
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:47,264
What about my high blood pressure?

275
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:55,064
You have above normal
systolic pressure - less dangerous
than a diastolic elevation.

276
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:57,344
It doesn't need treatment.

277
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:59,384
Do I need these?

278
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:06,704
There's a difference between the two
types of hypertension. I think...

279
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:12,464
Dr Metcalf doesn't know
the difference between
his ass and a hole!

280
00:29:12,464 --> 00:29:14,984
Folks are comfortable with him...

281
00:29:16,184 --> 00:29:20,584
Though when he first hit town
they were standoffish.

282
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:21,944
How did he overcome it?

283
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:25,144
He threw a party, invited the town.

284
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:31,064
If he were half as good at medicine
as he is at public relations,

285
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:34,384
he could run for Surgeon General!

286
00:29:34,384 --> 00:29:39,944
Next month, when the afternoons are
cooler, we'll throw you a party!

287
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,984
Thanks.

288
00:30:18,224 --> 00:30:20,264
SHE GASPS

289
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:10,304
So, is your one patient
a walking health hazard?

290
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:11,984
I couldn't find a wart on her.

291
00:31:11,984 --> 00:31:14,024
Great(!) So what do we do?

292
00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:20,624
Enjoy the fact that now we don't
live in the city, we needn't
call this pasta.

293
00:31:20,624 --> 00:31:21,584
Skinny spaghetti?

294
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:23,624
No, Daddy's not done.

295
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:31,424
Margaret, my tragically
healthy patient, will throw
a get-to-know-Dr Jennings party.

296
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:34,184
No, Daddy's not done!

297
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:40,424
Some punch with the new GP
and Canaima will
abandon Doc Metcalf...

298
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:42,544
It's a nice gesture.

299
00:31:42,544 --> 00:31:43,184
Yeah, I thought so.

300
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:44,624
Can we play with Bunny?

301
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:47,944
Yeah. I want you both in
before dark, though.

302
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:53,944
Bunny Beechwood. She popped up this
morning. A neighbour. Seems nice.

303
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:58,744
Bet they'll chase fireflies
or something?

304
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:01,064
Wanna blow up a bullfrog? OK!

305
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:05,144
I got great shots in the barn!

306
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:10,144
If my camera picks up the web
with the detail my eyes did...

307
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:12,184
The web?

308
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:15,824
Our spider
made himself a hell of a home!

309
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:18,104
Even you would appreciate it!

310
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:23,704
Molly, how can I make this
more clear? I have a...

311
00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:28,064
Terrible fear of spiders.
I've seen what happens.

312
00:32:28,064 --> 00:32:32,144
Which is why you should
force yourself to look at the web.

313
00:32:32,144 --> 00:32:33,944
Look at the web?!

314
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:38,744
See it for the extraordinary,
beautiful thing it is.

315
00:32:38,744 --> 00:32:41,624
Therapy! We live in the country.

316
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:45,344
Time to work out
this irrational, paralysing terror.

317
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,384
It's not irrational.

318
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,664
I know. The incident.

319
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,744
It's like yesterday.

320
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:55,304
Nobody remembers anything
from when they were two!

321
00:32:56,384 --> 00:32:57,944
It's my first memory.

322
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:03,104
I can envision the crib,
all around me, clear as day.

323
00:33:03,104 --> 00:33:08,744
I can feel waking up, drowsy,
peaceful, secure - and there it was.

324
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:10,544
Probably a daddy-longlegs.

325
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:12,584
It seemed huge.

326
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:18,584
It came crawling through the bars
of the crib, touched my bare leg...

327
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:20,384
You were wearing a diaper.

328
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,144
All my limbs froze, just froze!

329
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:25,424
You were still half-asleep.

330
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,584
I was paralysed, Molly!

331
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:31,064
Try to understand
how it makes me feel.

332
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:36,344
I was unable to stop it
from crawling along my naked skin!

333
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:40,544
I can still feel
its hairy little legs, just...

334
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:42,584
Then up to my face...

335
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:48,824
I felt utterly helpless,
being explored by an alien thing!

336
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:56,264
Can you blame me
for being a spider...phobe...?

337
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,744
Arachnophobe.

338
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,704
Whatever.

339
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:09,344
You see it up there?
Right behind the ladder.

340
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:18,464
Impressive, huh?

341
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,304
Therapy, right?

342
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:42,224
Right.

343
00:34:43,504 --> 00:34:45,464
Yeah.

344
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:54,224
Oh...

345
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,144
Oh, God!

346
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:07,864
You see? You still
have full use of all your limbs.

347
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,584
God, have you seen it up here?

348
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:20,624
Molly, I think you spared
the 8-legged Frank Lloyd Wright!

349
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:24,224
Ross!

350
00:35:26,264 --> 00:35:28,064
BOTH SCREAM

351
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:30,704
Are you OK? Honey, it's OK!

352
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:32,864
What the hell was that?!

353
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:35,264
It's... Ugh!

354
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:37,784
Come on!

355
00:35:38,744 --> 00:35:44,624
Oh, God! Oh, no!
HE LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY

356
00:35:46,184 --> 00:35:48,064
Jesus!

357
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,504
Hold me, hold me!

358
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:51,464
No, no! No!

359
00:35:52,904 --> 00:35:54,904
Oh, my God!

360
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:10,064
FRANK SINATRA:
# The summer wind came blowing in

361
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:12,424
# From across the sea

362
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:20,464
# It lingered there
and touched your hair

363
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:22,784
# And walked with me

364
00:36:25,504 --> 00:36:27,464
# All summer long... #

365
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:33,704
No, thanks.

366
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:35,744
How do you find life here?

367
00:36:35,744 --> 00:36:39,224
After a few initial shocks,
we're adjusting.

368
00:36:39,224 --> 00:36:41,744
I've been checking on you.

369
00:36:41,744 --> 00:36:47,144
When I'm ready to throw in
the towel, Dr Jennings is your man.

370
00:36:47,144 --> 00:36:48,104
Henry Beechwood.

371
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:49,304
Ross. Jennings.

372
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:51,664
By all accounts, a fine physician.

373
00:36:51,664 --> 00:36:53,624
I'll remember that.

374
00:36:53,624 --> 00:36:56,264
This brings back memories!

375
00:36:56,264 --> 00:37:00,104
When I moved here,
the whole town threw me a party.

376
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:02,864
No, you threw yourself a party!

377
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,784
Now, THAT was a party!

378
00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:06,784
Now, THAT is a jerk!

379
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,704
Canaima welcomes you.

380
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:39,704
Thank you.

381
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:42,344
I was interested in something.

382
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,104
Could you give me a little help?

383
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:47,464
Should I have this removed?

384
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:49,664
What's Bunny showing them?

385
00:37:49,664 --> 00:37:53,504
Green Beret
hand-to-hand combat methods.

386
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,584
Becky, thought about
what you'll major in at college?

387
00:37:57,584 --> 00:38:00,784
Gym.
It's in the genes.

388
00:38:00,784 --> 00:38:04,304
Bobby's a Bronco star quarterback.

389
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:06,344
Hi.

390
00:38:06,344 --> 00:38:10,544
He could throw a football before
he could walk! I coach the team.

391
00:38:10,544 --> 00:38:12,544
Nepotism, huh?

392
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:14,984
Actually, we're Baptists.

393
00:38:16,904 --> 00:38:21,824
Nobody says to a mortician,
"Irv, think I might be dead?"

394
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:26,864
Drive you nuts?
Dipping a Dorito as somebody
shows you his growth!

395
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:28,664
How do you handle it?

396
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:33,704
I just mention that my wife
was a successful stockbroker.

397
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:37,784
What about
artificial intelligence stock?

398
00:38:38,144 --> 00:38:39,704
Why shouldn't I have another?

399
00:38:39,704 --> 00:38:41,584
You've had too much.

400
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:43,424
No! I'm thirsty!

401
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:47,744
(The Manleys...
Their son passed away recently.)

402
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:49,544
Oh, that's awful! How?

403
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:51,464
I'm not sure. He was a scientist.

404
00:38:51,464 --> 00:38:51,944
Photographer.

405
00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:57,104
He was on an expedition
down in Venezuela.

406
00:38:58,064 --> 00:39:03,584
Nobody'd tell me how! Or
even let me see him to say goodbye!

407
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:05,264
Let's go.

408
00:39:05,264 --> 00:39:10,424
Why wouldn't they let me see him?
I don't understand!

409
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:14,864
I had to recommend a closed coffin.

410
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:18,584
His body looked all chewed up.

411
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:20,624
Drained.

412
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:26,264
Like some vampire had a go at him.
It was something terrible.

413
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:29,744
Excuse us.

414
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,544
Oh, yeah.

415
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:33,544
That's the apple?

416
00:39:34,784 --> 00:39:39,464
Bet you made enough friends
to break Sam's death grip!

417
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:41,864
We can't thank you enough.

418
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:45,704
Nor I you, for freeing
me from the pills!

419
00:39:45,704 --> 00:39:49,864
I feel I could compete
in a triathlon!

420
00:39:49,864 --> 00:39:52,144
After your check-up, I agree!

421
00:39:52,144 --> 00:39:53,144
Bye-bye, Margaret.

422
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:55,144
Bye, Molly.

423
00:39:56,744 --> 00:40:00,424
Irv! Blaire!
Would you like a doggie bag?

424
00:40:00,424 --> 00:40:04,624
We're fine, thank you.
Great party, Margaret!

425
00:40:52,464 --> 00:40:55,544
Come on, honey, the party's over!

426
00:41:01,904 --> 00:41:06,024
Happy hunting, Felix!
See you in the morning!

427
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:41,904
You'd have had too much punch,
and been the life of the party.

428
00:41:47,784 --> 00:41:49,824
I missed you!

429
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:56,904
Aaargh!

430
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:49,584
Ross! Ross!

431
00:42:49,824 --> 00:42:51,744
Molly?

432
00:42:53,664 --> 00:42:55,704
Ross!

433
00:42:55,704 --> 00:43:00,864
I could have killed you!
The nails came straight... Oh, God!

434
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:07,104
It's all rotten. My wine cellar
is probably crawling with termites!

435
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:09,024
I'm surprised
we haven't fallen through the floor!

436
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:12,264
Well, I'll call the exterminator.

437
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:19,584
You're casual
about the death of my dream!

438
00:43:19,584 --> 00:43:23,904
I tried to thank Margaret
for yesterday, but her line's busy.

439
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:26,184
She's probably gabbing.

440
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:28,824
You want me to...

441
00:43:28,824 --> 00:43:32,304
Yeah, OK,
I'll go over and check on her.

442
00:43:41,904 --> 00:43:43,944
CAT MIAOWS

443
00:43:47,064 --> 00:43:50,784
Here, Kitty!
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!

444
00:43:54,024 --> 00:43:56,064
Margaret!

445
00:44:06,864 --> 00:44:08,064
What'd you think, Doc?

446
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:12,504
Heart attack. Bound to happen
sooner rather than later.

447
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:16,824
She had high blood pressure,
even with pills.

448
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:17,904
I took her off those.

449
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:20,064
What right did you have?

450
00:44:20,064 --> 00:44:22,304
She came to me as a patient.

451
00:44:22,304 --> 00:44:24,624
You didn't see
she was hypertensive?

452
00:44:24,624 --> 00:44:29,984
Her diastolic reading was normal,
her systolic below 160.

453
00:44:29,984 --> 00:44:33,864
This is a very serious matter,
young man!

454
00:44:35,544 --> 00:44:37,544
You may have killed her.

455
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:41,064
She was in fine shape. I want
an autopsy.

456
00:44:41,064 --> 00:44:42,144
Never!

457
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:44,064
She was my patient.

458
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:45,264
And mine for 40 years!

459
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:49,824
She wouldn't want to be butchered!
Nobody would want it for her!

460
00:44:49,824 --> 00:44:51,864
Give it to me, Irv.

461
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:54,264
I'm satisfied if you are, Doc.

462
00:44:54,264 --> 00:44:58,464
You come from a city,
where people don't care!

463
00:44:58,464 --> 00:45:01,584
I don't expect you to understand.

464
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:03,384
A little advice.

465
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:07,824
To fit in, learn to be
sensitive to people's feelings!

466
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:12,744
I'm interested in medicine,
not public relations(!)

467
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:19,584
Cardiac victims
don't bite their tongues off!
She had tetanic convulsions.

468
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:20,664
This case isn't closed!

469
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:22,704
You're damn right!

470
00:45:22,704 --> 00:45:29,304
I believe you may be guilty
of medical malpractice!
I intend to pursue it!

471
00:45:37,704 --> 00:45:42,624
I understand she was your patient.
Your only patient.

472
00:45:42,624 --> 00:45:47,664
Come by the gym tomorrow at 3.
I'll throw you some business.

473
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:51,744
Thank you, Henry!
Thanks, I appreciate that!

474
00:45:52,344 --> 00:45:57,264
Nice. Think he could say it
a little louder, though(?)

475
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:01,104
MUSIC PLAYS

476
00:46:07,944 --> 00:46:09,864
HE SIGHS

477
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:15,624
A little young, isn't it?

478
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:17,184
The wine?

479
00:46:17,184 --> 00:46:20,784
No. Margaret. To die at 68.

480
00:46:25,104 --> 00:46:32,424
You know, that's 10 years below life
expectancy of a Caucasian female.

481
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:37,704
You're a fine doctor. You knew what
you were doing taking her off pills.

482
00:46:37,704 --> 00:46:40,584
Like when I chose this town...

483
00:46:40,584 --> 00:46:48,744
with the country doctor from hell,
or this house, which is rotting
from the ground up(!)

484
00:46:49,104 --> 00:46:51,144
I'll take care of that.

485
00:46:51,464 --> 00:46:56,184
Well, Margaret's
still gonna be dead in the morning.

486
00:46:58,824 --> 00:47:01,824
I still wanna know what killed her.

487
00:47:17,904 --> 00:47:22,104
He was nailing something in the
cellar, and the wood disintegrated.

488
00:47:22,104 --> 00:47:23,904
Termites, huh?

489
00:47:23,904 --> 00:47:26,064
That's what my husband thought.

490
00:47:26,064 --> 00:47:28,224
He's an expert in these matters(?)

491
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:30,344
Well, no...

492
00:47:30,344 --> 00:47:32,424
Didn't think so.

493
00:47:32,424 --> 00:47:34,584
I'm glad you called me.

494
00:47:37,464 --> 00:47:40,544
No room for amateurs in this game.

495
00:47:51,384 --> 00:47:53,424
Oh! Oh!

496
00:47:58,824 --> 00:48:00,864
Ah, thank you.

497
00:48:04,224 --> 00:48:06,024
Haa!

498
00:48:06,024 --> 00:48:07,464
What is it?

499
00:48:07,464 --> 00:48:09,464
It's hard to say.

500
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:12,704
Would anybody object
if I tore the floor out?

501
00:48:12,704 --> 00:48:13,704
I would!

502
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:15,624
False alarm, then. Lead on.

503
00:48:17,304 --> 00:48:18,744
How bad is it?

504
00:48:18,744 --> 00:48:20,664
Ssshh!

505
00:48:22,344 --> 00:48:24,584
I didn't find a thing.

506
00:48:24,584 --> 00:48:26,904
Then why is the wood rotting?

507
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,944
I'll tell you why.

508
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:32,184
Bad wood.

509
00:48:32,184 --> 00:48:34,224
So...what do we do?

510
00:48:34,224 --> 00:48:36,504
Tear out bad wood.

511
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:39,384
Put in good wood.

512
00:48:40,824 --> 00:48:43,104
My husband thought
this'd make a good wine cellar.

513
00:48:43,104 --> 00:48:46,704
Yeah? I collect beer cans myself.

514
00:48:46,704 --> 00:48:51,264
I got a rare '74 Miller Lite
with a misprinted label.

515
00:48:51,264 --> 00:48:54,744
Only 100 in circulation.
He might want a look.

516
00:48:55,704 --> 00:48:58,464
Oh, no hard shoes on the court.

517
00:48:58,464 --> 00:48:59,544
Sorry.

518
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:07,944
I know what a blow losing Margaret
was. People keep score. You're only
as good as your last game.

519
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,504
I appreciate your concern.

520
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:12,024
I want you to enjoy Canaima.

521
00:49:12,024 --> 00:49:17,504
Clean water, fresh air.
No police sirens wailing all night!

522
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:20,304
Just crickets up the wazoo!

523
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:24,624
Actually,
I haven't heard any crickets lately.

524
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:26,624
I haven't, either.

525
00:49:26,624 --> 00:49:31,104
OK, Broncos, the doc's here!
Get ready to drop 'em!

526
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:34,344
Doc wants to hear you cough!

527
00:49:44,784 --> 00:49:46,704
HE COUGHS

528
00:49:55,824 --> 00:49:57,864
MORE COUGHING

529
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:05,784
HE COUGHS

530
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:09,384
HE COUGHS FEEBLY

531
00:50:11,664 --> 00:50:17,544
Call yourself Broncos? You look
like babies! Come on! Snap to it!

532
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,584
On the ball.

533
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:30,224
Hurry up, let's go! Come on!
Another play.

534
00:50:30,224 --> 00:50:35,864
Come on, you're moving
in slow motion!
Move it! Move it!

535
00:50:38,904 --> 00:50:40,704
Hike!

536
00:50:43,944 --> 00:50:47,144
A banana-out?!
That's a banana-split!

537
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,144
Shitty pass!

538
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:49,944
I heard that, McGrath!

539
00:50:49,944 --> 00:50:53,304
Garbage-mouth! Wash that mouth out!

540
00:50:53,304 --> 00:50:55,344
Miller! Yo!

541
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,744
You know the patterns?

542
00:50:56,744 --> 00:50:58,104
Like the back of my hand!

543
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:02,664
Get in here!
Run the same thing again.

544
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:06,144
Come on, we're waiting on you!
Let's go!

545
00:51:06,144 --> 00:51:09,984
Come on, Miller! Wanna play?
Let's go!

546
00:51:10,704 --> 00:51:12,744
Thanks.

547
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:14,664
Run it!

548
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:16,824
Set! Hut! Hike!

549
00:51:23,544 --> 00:51:25,304
Arrggh!

550
00:51:26,664 --> 00:51:27,984
Come on! Come on, up, up!

551
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,584
Easy up! Let's up!
That's back! Let's go!

552
00:51:33,704 --> 00:51:35,664
Miller, you all right?

553
00:51:35,984 --> 00:51:36,984
Coach!

554
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:39,384
What's wrong with Miller?

555
00:51:39,944 --> 00:51:42,144
Back up, let him breathe!

556
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:44,424
What's wrong? What is it?

557
00:51:44,424 --> 00:51:46,824
Come on, give him some air!

558
00:51:48,144 --> 00:51:50,784
OK, let's get his helmet off.

559
00:51:50,784 --> 00:51:54,264
Real easy.
Support his head. Easy, easy!

560
00:51:54,264 --> 00:51:56,184
Real gentle.

561
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,904
Real gentle.

562
00:52:03,264 --> 00:52:05,184
Look out, look out.

563
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:18,864
From what I hear
it wasn't a very hard tackle.

564
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:24,024
I only wish I knew. You see,
Dr Jennings examined him last.

565
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:36,264
Hey...

566
00:52:36,264 --> 00:52:38,264
Why so gloomy?

567
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:44,264
Bunny Beechwood says
everybody's calling you Dr Death.

568
00:52:45,024 --> 00:52:47,184
That's just silly, Shelley.

569
00:52:47,184 --> 00:52:50,184
They say you want
to cut people up into pieces.

570
00:52:50,184 --> 00:52:52,224
Oh, Tom, look.

571
00:52:52,224 --> 00:52:54,584
It's called an autopsy.

572
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:56,784
It's not a pleasant thing.

573
00:52:56,784 --> 00:53:01,224
But sometimes it's the only way
to see what happened.

574
00:53:01,224 --> 00:53:05,904
But some doctors won't accept it.

575
00:53:05,904 --> 00:53:12,504
Some doctors won't accept
city methods don't work
in a small town.

576
00:53:12,504 --> 00:53:18,704
Both Margaret and that poor boy did
seem healthy. Odd, don't you think?

577
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:24,864
If I autopsied every heart attack,
I'd be run out of Canaima!

578
00:53:24,864 --> 00:53:28,464
Poor Sam. You think life
is a popularity contest!

579
00:53:30,144 --> 00:53:33,704
You're not jealous
of our new doctor?

580
00:53:33,704 --> 00:53:35,664
What?!

581
00:53:35,664 --> 00:53:37,944
You made me lose my timing!

582
00:53:37,944 --> 00:53:41,504
You're yelling, Sam.
Come on to bed.

583
00:53:41,504 --> 00:53:43,224
Come on!

584
00:53:45,024 --> 00:53:46,904
I need a shower.

585
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:50,544
I'd love to take walks
around the neighbourhood with you.

586
00:53:50,544 --> 00:53:52,944
It's not the same, Evelyn.

587
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:58,464
I need to know how far I've gone,
and exactly how long it took me.

588
00:53:59,784 --> 00:54:01,344
Floor's cold, Sam.

589
00:54:01,344 --> 00:54:03,824
You're right. You're always right!

590
00:54:08,784 --> 00:54:10,704
Damn!

591
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,264
What's wrong?

592
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:14,064
Some damn thing bit me.

593
00:54:16,104 --> 00:54:17,624
It's just a spider!

594
00:54:17,624 --> 00:54:21,744
Spider?
It felt like a damn cougar! Damn!

595
00:54:22,824 --> 00:54:24,384
Damn!

596
00:54:25,344 --> 00:54:26,904
I'm having a seizure!

597
00:54:26,904 --> 00:54:28,824
Sam, what should I do?

598
00:54:28,824 --> 00:54:31,704
Get an ambulance. Call Jennings.

599
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:33,624
My God!

600
00:54:38,304 --> 00:54:39,864
I'll be right there.

601
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:42,624
What's going on?

602
00:54:42,624 --> 00:54:44,184
Metcalf. He's having a seizure.

603
00:54:45,144 --> 00:54:48,264
Thank God you didn't examine
HIM this morning!

604
00:54:51,984 --> 00:54:53,984
Why's the Coroner here?

605
00:54:53,984 --> 00:54:55,944
I don't know.

606
00:54:55,944 --> 00:54:58,104
Milt, this isn't necessary!

607
00:54:58,104 --> 00:55:00,384
I'll be the judge, Lloyd.

608
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:02,304
Wait out here.

609
00:55:02,304 --> 00:55:04,464
Guard the house, or something, hmm?

610
00:55:04,464 --> 00:55:06,504
Guard the house(!)

611
00:55:07,584 --> 00:55:10,824
Was he alive when you got here?

612
00:55:10,824 --> 00:55:13,944
He'd been dead maybe five minutes.

613
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:17,424
Whatever it was,
it was abrupt and acute.

614
00:55:17,424 --> 00:55:21,264
Massive coronary
or cerebral haemorrhage?

615
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:25,704
His wife says he was bitten
by a spider before he seized.

616
00:55:25,704 --> 00:55:27,704
Oh, right(!)

617
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:29,744
Sam told me about you.

618
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:34,224
The hotshot who won't accept
anyone else's diagnosis.

619
00:55:34,224 --> 00:55:37,104
I'll accept it if I agree with it.

620
00:55:37,104 --> 00:55:38,784
Good.

621
00:55:38,784 --> 00:55:42,144
Let me show you something.
Down here.

622
00:55:45,744 --> 00:55:48,504
I believe that's a spider bite.

623
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:52,104
I'll buy that.

624
00:55:52,104 --> 00:55:54,624
But I doubt that killed him.

625
00:55:54,624 --> 00:56:02,424
In 20 years I've seen one
spider-bite fatality...
a black widow and a child.

626
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:05,904
No, my guess is
Sam overexerted himself.

627
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,304
He used the treadmill
before he keeled over.

628
00:56:08,304 --> 00:56:10,904
Yeah, well, you may be right.

629
00:56:12,144 --> 00:56:16,824
I want an autopsy.
Tissue samples, blood toxicology.

630
00:56:16,824 --> 00:56:18,744
Wait just one second!
Shut up, Lloyd.

631
00:56:18,744 --> 00:56:20,544
You'll get Evelyn's permission?

632
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,504
Of course.

633
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:22,584
Need a ride home?

634
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:24,744
No, I'm all right, thanks.

635
00:56:24,744 --> 00:56:28,304
Take care! You're the town doctor!

636
00:56:28,304 --> 00:56:30,264
Say "Ah".

637
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:32,904
Ahhh.

638
00:56:32,904 --> 00:56:37,104
OK, we'll treat this inflammation
with antibiotics.

639
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:41,424
So I don't get any ice cream?

640
00:56:41,424 --> 00:56:43,704
I'll buy you a double scoop!

641
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:45,744
Who's next?

642
00:56:45,744 --> 00:56:48,144
I'll take that, thank you!

643
00:56:48,144 --> 00:56:50,064
Step right this way.

644
00:56:50,064 --> 00:56:51,384
Have a seat. Be right with you.

645
00:56:51,384 --> 00:56:53,424
Thank you.

646
00:56:57,144 --> 00:57:00,384
OK, hotshot, are you sitting down?

647
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:08,664
Sam died from a minute amount
of an unidentified toxic substance
in his blood.

648
00:57:08,664 --> 00:57:14,904
'My office isn't ruling out
poisoning, or even killer spiders.

649
00:57:14,904 --> 00:57:21,984
'It looks like a heart attack to me,
but I'll support
whatever you'd like to do.'

650
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:26,064
I gotta have those bodies exhumed,
Milt. I gotta be sure.

651
00:57:27,024 --> 00:57:30,504
OK, whatever you think necessary.

652
00:57:31,544 --> 00:57:33,504
Thanks.

653
00:57:33,504 --> 00:57:35,624
Are you out of your mind?

654
00:57:35,624 --> 00:57:41,424
Once more, I want Margaret Hollins
and Todd Miller exhumed.

655
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:45,384
Hey! Hey! Hey...

656
00:57:45,384 --> 00:57:51,384
You pull them out the ground when
they should be enjoying
eternal rest...

657
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,784
I'll just get a court order!

658
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:56,064
Milt Briggs is on my side.

659
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:04,344
This is a very bad business,
Mr Yale Graduate, Big City Doctor!

660
00:58:04,344 --> 00:58:06,264
No shit(!)

661
00:58:16,824 --> 00:58:17,784
Hi, Dad!

662
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:18,864
Hi, honey!

663
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:20,664
What's going on?

664
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:23,264
Shelley's staying
the night with Bunny.

665
00:58:23,264 --> 00:58:26,904
We'll take good care of her,
Dr Jennings.

666
00:58:29,904 --> 00:58:31,704
Wait.

667
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:37,104
There may be some spiders
that are very dangerous, OK?

668
00:58:37,104 --> 00:58:39,864
I want you to be aware of this.

669
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:43,944
If you see one,
don't try to capture or kill it.

670
00:58:43,944 --> 00:58:46,344
Just run. You understand?

671
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,064
Run!

672
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:51,824
We'll do that, Dr Jennings.

673
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:54,984
Don't worry about anything.

674
00:58:54,984 --> 00:58:57,264
THEY GIGGLE
BUNNY: Yo, Dr Death!

675
00:59:00,984 --> 00:59:02,984
Are you all right?

676
00:59:02,984 --> 00:59:04,944
No.

677
00:59:15,744 --> 00:59:17,664
All clear.

678
00:59:24,504 --> 00:59:30,624
"The spider was asleep.
It had been a very, very busy day."

679
00:59:30,624 --> 00:59:32,664
OK, your turn, Bunny.

680
00:59:33,624 --> 00:59:35,184
# The itsy-bitsy SPIDER...

681
00:59:35,184 --> 00:59:37,344
SHE SQUEALS

682
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:40,824
# Crawled up the water spout

683
00:59:40,824 --> 00:59:45,024
# Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

684
00:59:46,064 --> 00:59:50,424
# Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain

685
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:55,824
# And the itsy-bitsy spider
crawled up the spout again. #

686
00:59:55,824 --> 00:59:57,464
It's my turn now.

687
00:59:57,464 --> 01:00:02,184
"Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet,
eating her curds and whey.

688
01:00:02,184 --> 01:00:03,944
"Along came a SPIDER...

689
01:00:03,944 --> 01:00:05,544
THEY BOTH SCREAM

690
01:00:05,544 --> 01:00:08,664
"..that sat down beside her, and
frightened Miss Muffet...

691
01:00:08,664 --> 01:00:10,304
BOTH: Aarrgghh!

692
01:00:10,304 --> 01:00:13,704
Settle down, or Shelley can't stay!

693
01:00:13,704 --> 01:00:15,264
We can't sleep!

694
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:16,824
We keep scaring each other.

695
01:00:16,824 --> 01:00:19,344
Why don't you sleep in my room
for a while? OK.

696
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:22,584
Nah, we don't need this.

697
01:01:03,504 --> 01:01:05,544
Argh! Oh, God!

698
01:01:08,184 --> 01:01:09,864
CRICKET CHIRPS

699
01:01:19,824 --> 01:01:21,384
You son of a bitch!

700
01:01:22,704 --> 01:01:24,744
FRANTIC CHIRPING

701
01:01:25,824 --> 01:01:30,144
Where are the other crickets?
Where are all your buddies?

702
01:01:50,424 --> 01:01:52,344
PHONE RINGS

703
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,984
Atherton.

704
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,024
Yes, Dr Atherton?

705
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:05,544
I'm Ross Jennings.

706
01:02:05,544 --> 01:02:12,144
I'm a general practitioner and I've
a problem that may be spider related.

707
01:02:12,144 --> 01:02:16,104
You're the foremost authority
on the West Coast, or any coast!

708
01:02:17,544 --> 01:02:25,184
Every so often in some little town
there's a health scare -
an unexplained outbreak.

709
01:02:25,184 --> 01:02:28,464
Spiders make convenient culprits.

710
01:02:28,464 --> 01:02:35,304
'On every suburban acre there are
50,000 to 60,000 spiders

711
01:02:35,304 --> 01:02:39,984
and each spider
eats about 100 insects a year?

712
01:02:39,984 --> 01:02:44,424
'So, 5 million insects are consumed
per acre annually.'

713
01:02:44,424 --> 01:02:51,024
Perhaps man might find the planet
uninhabitable without spiders.

714
01:02:51,024 --> 01:02:59,064
'I've nothing against them,
but we've had 3 deaths and I fear
there'll be more.

715
01:02:59,064 --> 01:03:03,504
'Lend me your
expertise for an afternoon.'

716
01:03:03,504 --> 01:03:05,304
It's a town called Canaima.

717
01:03:05,304 --> 01:03:06,864
Canaima?

718
01:03:06,864 --> 01:03:08,664
'Yeah. You know it?'

719
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:10,664
It's familiar.

720
01:03:10,664 --> 01:03:14,304
Let me see what I can do.
Where are you, exactly?

721
01:03:22,944 --> 01:03:24,984
Collins. Collins!

722
01:03:26,424 --> 01:03:27,504
Oh. Sorry.

723
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:30,504
Are you equally busy tomorrow(?)

724
01:03:50,544 --> 01:03:51,624
Dr Atherton?

725
01:03:51,624 --> 01:03:55,464
No, Chris Collins, his assistant.

726
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:58,064
I'm Chris. Atherton's busy.

727
01:03:58,064 --> 01:04:02,184
He's found a new species
of spider in South America.

728
01:04:02,184 --> 01:04:05,184
Er, to us it's a big deal.

729
01:04:06,744 --> 01:04:10,344
I hope you can help.
We'll be examining bodies.

730
01:04:10,344 --> 01:04:12,744
Sounds like a blast(!)

731
01:04:13,704 --> 01:04:16,104
We're looking for bites.

732
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,384
Like this.
That's a spider, isn't it?

733
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:25,464
Er, I'm not sure. I think so.

734
01:04:26,424 --> 01:04:30,144
But even at several times
the potency of Latrodectus...

735
01:04:30,144 --> 01:04:31,824
Latro... Black widow, right?

736
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:39,744
Right. It'd take more than
one bite to kill. This death
and the bite are coincidental.

737
01:04:39,744 --> 01:04:41,384
Hey, guys, how's it going?

738
01:04:43,344 --> 01:04:45,384
Poor Margaret!

739
01:04:45,384 --> 01:04:49,944
She was a good wife,
good teacher, good neighbour...

740
01:04:49,944 --> 01:04:54,344
Excellent cook.
Anything you want, just shout.

741
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:57,864
I want some fresh air.

742
01:04:57,864 --> 01:05:00,504
Chris! Chris! Come here!

743
01:05:05,544 --> 01:05:08,544
Still think it's a coincidence?

744
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:11,064
That's a spider bite.

745
01:05:11,304 --> 01:05:13,344
The tissue around it is macerated.

746
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:16,304
A mark behind the left ear.

747
01:05:16,304 --> 01:05:18,264
PHONE RINGS

748
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:22,344
Atherton.

749
01:05:22,344 --> 01:05:24,384
'Chris Collins.

750
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:27,384
'We've a big problem in Canaima.

751
01:05:27,384 --> 01:05:33,744
'They've 3 dead. The cause seems
to be a spider deadlier
than any I've seen.

752
01:05:33,744 --> 01:05:35,784
'They want to quarantine the town!'

753
01:05:35,784 --> 01:05:37,344
Are you sure?

754
01:05:37,344 --> 01:05:39,504
This is way out of my league.

755
01:05:39,504 --> 01:05:43,464
It's a decision you have to make.
You better come up.

756
01:05:44,744 --> 01:05:47,904
I can be there
tomorrow afternoon...

757
01:05:47,904 --> 01:05:51,504
But, Collins,
try and find me a specimen.

758
01:06:52,464 --> 01:06:54,144
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

759
01:07:12,464 --> 01:07:14,504
Bring the keys? ^

760
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:16,584
Great. Perk up, Lloyd!

761
01:07:16,584 --> 01:07:21,384
If we find the spider that did this,
you can arrest him!

762
01:07:33,024 --> 01:07:35,664
Milt, will you cover
the living room?

763
01:07:36,464 --> 01:07:39,624
Chris, you check out back.

764
01:07:40,704 --> 01:07:42,984
And, Lloyd...take the kitchen.

765
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:49,584
I'll just... I'll oversee...
I'll just coordinate the...

766
01:07:49,584 --> 01:07:52,224
I'll just stay right here.

767
01:08:58,584 --> 01:09:00,984
What is all that crap?

768
01:09:00,984 --> 01:09:05,384
Leftovers. Mostly cricket parts.
Wings, legs.

769
01:09:06,504 --> 01:09:10,584
We haven't heard any crickets
for weeks.

770
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:17,264
Arrggh!

771
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:20,664
Ross! Here! Ross!

772
01:09:20,664 --> 01:09:22,224
Sheriff, don't move!

773
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:24,864
It's dead! Shit!

774
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:27,384
What could have killed it?

775
01:09:27,384 --> 01:09:30,264
The shock of seeing Lloyd?

776
01:09:36,264 --> 01:09:37,304
KNOCK ON DOOR

777
01:09:37,304 --> 01:09:39,864
There are other people
in this house!

778
01:09:39,864 --> 01:09:41,904
Dad, go away!

779
01:09:43,104 --> 01:09:44,984
Dad, go away!

780
01:09:44,984 --> 01:09:47,664
Use the one down here, Henry!

781
01:10:41,744 --> 01:10:43,344
SHE SCREAMS

782
01:10:45,584 --> 01:10:47,544
Never a moment's peace!

783
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:49,584
SHE SCREAMS

784
01:10:51,024 --> 01:10:53,144
What happened? Are you OK?

785
01:10:53,144 --> 01:10:54,624
SHE SCREAMS AGAIN

786
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:05,624
Why don't we take the dead spider
and get out?

787
01:11:05,624 --> 01:11:07,224
You don't get off that easy!

788
01:11:07,224 --> 01:11:09,384
The dead spider's desiccated.
No use to us.

789
01:11:09,384 --> 01:11:11,264
You mean macerated.

790
01:11:11,264 --> 01:11:14,664
No, desiccated.
Dried up, drained of blood.

791
01:11:14,664 --> 01:11:15,744
Macerated is the...

792
01:11:15,744 --> 01:11:16,944
Chewing they do.

793
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:18,984
Chewing, right.

794
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:22,304
They're like little vampires.

795
01:11:22,304 --> 01:11:25,464
This trip to find
the spider species, where'd he go?

796
01:11:25,464 --> 01:11:29,064
South America. Venezuela. Why?

797
01:11:34,104 --> 01:11:35,784
Is that one of 'em?

798
01:11:35,784 --> 01:11:38,544
I'd say it's a damn fine suspect.

799
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:53,064
Ross, you're gonna
have to take a step towards it.

800
01:11:54,264 --> 01:11:55,704
Chris, I'm scared to death!

801
01:11:55,704 --> 01:12:02,664
We all are, but our brains secrete
a neuro-transmitter to help us.

802
01:12:02,664 --> 01:12:05,864
I don't have
that particular neuro-transmitter.

803
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:08,064
Yes, you do.

804
01:12:18,624 --> 01:12:20,624
Wow.

805
01:12:27,144 --> 01:12:28,664
DOG BARKS

806
01:12:31,704 --> 01:12:39,704
You need an asbestos glove,
the Doomsday weapon
in Delbert's war on creepy-crawlies.

807
01:12:39,704 --> 01:12:44,544
I coat it with Denon EC.
It's biodegradable, organic.

808
01:12:44,544 --> 01:12:49,544
You should see the beasties twitch
when they get a whiff!

809
01:12:57,344 --> 01:12:58,544
Er, Delbert...

810
01:13:01,224 --> 01:13:08,664
There's a rumour going
that a spider killed Sam,
maybe Margaret, even my Bronco.

811
01:13:08,664 --> 01:13:10,344
Doubtful, Henry.

812
01:13:10,904 --> 01:13:16,824
In Florida, one of my colleagues
bumped into a nest of black widows.

813
01:13:16,824 --> 01:13:19,584
Over a dozen bites, and lived.

814
01:13:22,944 --> 01:13:28,104
Course, he probably lost control
of his bodily functions.

815
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:35,624
Nothing here.
But I'll hunt the alleged arachnid
and spritz him to kingdom come.

816
01:14:16,544 --> 01:14:17,544
DOG BARKS

817
01:14:17,544 --> 01:14:20,144
Yeah, that's right! I'm bad!

818
01:14:21,264 --> 01:14:22,824
KNOCK ON DOOR

819
01:14:29,544 --> 01:14:32,184
Dr Atherton... Ross Jennings.

820
01:14:33,744 --> 01:14:35,184
Come in.

821
01:14:36,224 --> 01:14:37,904
Did you find another specimen?

822
01:14:37,904 --> 01:14:42,104
Yes. I also called
the town mortician.

823
01:14:42,104 --> 01:14:44,424
Months ago, there was a corpse.

824
01:14:44,424 --> 01:14:48,264
The body was desiccated,
drained of blood.

825
01:14:48,264 --> 01:14:54,504
Irv agreed, if the spider was big
and spent long enough on the body...

826
01:14:54,504 --> 01:15:00,864
I know why you've heard of Canaima.
This was Jerry Manley's hometown.

827
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:03,264
Manley the photographer?

828
01:15:03,264 --> 01:15:07,664
I think a Venezuelan spider hitched
a ride in his coffin.

829
01:15:13,344 --> 01:15:18,384
The fangs, injectors,
are disproportionately large.

830
01:15:18,384 --> 01:15:19,544
3 poison sacs.

831
01:15:19,544 --> 01:15:22,824
Now, let's test the venom.

832
01:15:29,184 --> 01:15:34,944
The toxin and amount injected
determine the effect of the bite.

833
01:15:34,944 --> 01:15:38,664
And the place
where the subject is bitten.

834
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:41,664
It can lead to paralysis or death.

835
01:15:46,344 --> 01:15:48,384
SQUEAKING

836
01:15:48,384 --> 01:15:53,064
I'd guess this toxin
is fatal at a fraction of that dose.

837
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:55,104
I'd agree.

838
01:16:01,104 --> 01:16:03,104
No sex organs.

839
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:08,544
That would make them drones -
or soldiers!

840
01:16:09,704 --> 01:16:16,824
That's typical in organised insects
- bees, ants. I never saw it
in spiders!

841
01:16:16,824 --> 01:16:18,024
I have.

842
01:16:18,024 --> 01:16:19,584
Venezuela, right?

843
01:16:19,584 --> 01:16:22,344
Right. This is a descendant.

844
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:28,304
Somehow, a male mated with a house
spider to make a deadly strain.

845
01:16:28,304 --> 01:16:31,104
But with no sex organs,
it can't reproduce.

846
01:16:31,104 --> 01:16:37,584
True. And the accelerated growth
rate suggests a short life cycle.

847
01:16:37,584 --> 01:16:39,744
We already saw a dead one.

848
01:16:39,744 --> 01:16:41,184
That could be the good news!

849
01:16:41,184 --> 01:16:43,224
Let's discuss the bad!

850
01:16:44,304 --> 01:16:49,784
The species I found in S America
live at the top of the food chain.

851
01:16:49,784 --> 01:16:55,944
They spread out
from a nest in a web-like pattern,
and dominate the area.

852
01:16:55,944 --> 01:17:00,984
In their habitat, they're contained
by geography - not true here.

853
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:05,904
So the original male's
the granddaddy of 'em all,

854
01:17:05,904 --> 01:17:06,864
and he's sending troops to battle.

855
01:17:06,864 --> 01:17:08,424
Right. Er...

856
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:11,624
Excuse me! Professor?

857
01:17:11,624 --> 01:17:13,224
This is our town exterminator.

858
01:17:13,224 --> 01:17:16,344
McClintock.
Nice to meet a colleague.

859
01:17:16,344 --> 01:17:20,304
He came across one of the offenders
a few hours ago.

860
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:22,704
Have you brought it with you?

861
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:25,464
It's still on the bottom of my shoe.

862
01:17:26,664 --> 01:17:28,824
You can't tell what it is any more.

863
01:17:31,224 --> 01:17:36,864
In this first generation,
the original male produced a queen.

864
01:17:36,864 --> 01:17:40,224
They'll build a nest
for the queen to guard.

865
01:17:40,224 --> 01:17:47,024
She'll create
reproductive offspring,
and then this town is dead.

866
01:17:47,024 --> 01:17:51,024
And the next town,
the next town, and the next.

867
01:17:51,024 --> 01:17:55,824
Irv owns the mortuary where it
originated. If we kill the male...

868
01:17:55,824 --> 01:17:59,664
And nest.
I'll call the Dept of Agriculture.

869
01:17:59,664 --> 01:18:00,744
OK. Phone's in the office.

870
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:02,904
See you at the mortuary.

871
01:18:02,904 --> 01:18:05,064
Sheriff, give me a ride.

872
01:18:05,064 --> 01:18:07,344
I am not a chauffeur!
Shut up, Lloyd.

873
01:18:07,344 --> 01:18:09,024
Damn! It's busy!

874
01:18:09,024 --> 01:18:12,584
Irv takes the phone off the hook
for Wheel of Fortune.

875
01:18:12,584 --> 01:18:14,144
Let's go!

876
01:18:27,384 --> 01:18:29,384
NOISE FROM TV

877
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:38,744
Blaire, real or fake butter?
Fake!

878
01:18:43,424 --> 01:18:45,024
Irv, hurry!

879
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:46,584
Buttery, hot and delicious!

880
01:18:57,504 --> 01:19:02,664
'$1,000. T. There are two Ts.
That's quite a start!'

881
01:19:02,664 --> 01:19:04,104
He needs to buy a vowel.

882
01:19:10,944 --> 01:19:13,184
Buy a vowel!

883
01:19:15,264 --> 01:19:17,264
TYRES SCREECH

884
01:19:18,744 --> 01:19:20,384
Delbert!!

885
01:19:25,104 --> 01:19:27,024
What'll this nest look like?

886
01:19:27,024 --> 01:19:30,624
Well, you'd know if you found it.

887
01:19:30,624 --> 01:19:33,984
The area would be dark, warm, moist.

888
01:19:33,984 --> 01:19:37,184
A musty smell,
and you'd see an egg sac.

889
01:19:37,184 --> 01:19:39,144
Like your basic egg sac.

890
01:19:39,144 --> 01:19:44,664
Uh, white, cocooned, pulsating,
about the size of a softball.

891
01:19:44,664 --> 01:19:47,424
And no other spiders around.

892
01:19:47,424 --> 01:19:48,504
What do you mean?

893
01:19:48,504 --> 01:19:55,464
Spiders are cannibals, she wouldn't
want any others near her offspring.

894
01:19:55,464 --> 01:20:00,824
Tell them - even if it means
interrupting a dinner party!

895
01:20:00,824 --> 01:20:02,784
Sheriff!

896
01:20:08,664 --> 01:20:10,224
Where is this?

897
01:20:10,224 --> 01:20:13,584
The Daniels place.
Jennings bought it.

898
01:20:13,584 --> 01:20:14,904
Take me there!

899
01:20:34,344 --> 01:20:36,424
NOISE FROM TV

900
01:20:36,424 --> 01:20:37,504
Hey, Irv! Irv!

901
01:20:39,664 --> 01:20:41,464
Ross...

902
01:20:41,464 --> 01:20:43,624
Canaima welcomes you.

903
01:20:43,624 --> 01:20:46,984
Irv, we have an emergency! We...

904
01:20:57,184 --> 01:20:58,144
Aarrghh!

905
01:21:05,224 --> 01:21:07,864
I'll get us into the mortuary.

906
01:21:09,544 --> 01:21:10,864
Ross. Ross!

907
01:21:39,184 --> 01:21:40,504
We've found it!

908
01:21:44,344 --> 01:21:49,384
Go to the mortuary, get
my assistant and the exterminator.

909
01:21:49,384 --> 01:21:51,744
Right, I'll do that.

910
01:21:51,744 --> 01:21:56,104
Stay here, sir - I'm not
responsible for you! Fine!

911
01:22:10,744 --> 01:22:14,224
The killings are so arbitrary,
maybe there's more than one nest.

912
01:22:14,224 --> 01:22:16,024
No, there's just one.

913
01:22:16,024 --> 01:22:17,344
What was it Atherton said?

914
01:22:17,344 --> 01:22:21,304
They radiate
from a central nest. Got a map?

915
01:22:21,304 --> 01:22:22,264
Thinking about buying here...?

916
01:22:22,264 --> 01:22:23,824
Come on, get a map, please!

917
01:22:23,824 --> 01:22:25,624
Here. Here.

918
01:22:25,624 --> 01:22:31,024
The Kendalls. The Kendalls' house.
Mark that down on there.

919
01:22:31,984 --> 01:22:33,544
And the old guy - the doctor.

920
01:22:33,544 --> 01:22:35,584
Metcalf.

921
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:37,944
Kid died on the football field
behind the school.

922
01:22:37,944 --> 01:22:41,304
This is fun!
I found one at Beechwoods'.

923
01:22:41,304 --> 01:22:42,504
The old lady...

924
01:22:42,504 --> 01:22:44,104
Margaret.

925
01:22:44,104 --> 01:22:46,224
Is that all of them? That's it.

926
01:22:46,224 --> 01:22:48,184
In the centre, that's the mortuary?

927
01:22:48,184 --> 01:22:49,984
No, that's a house.

928
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,544
Who the hell lives there?

929
01:22:52,504 --> 01:22:54,144
I do.

930
01:23:00,064 --> 01:23:03,544
The whole time the nest was
in MY barn!

931
01:23:03,544 --> 01:23:08,344
I doubt it. A spider
would find your barn a tad breezy.

932
01:23:08,344 --> 01:23:12,064
In that respect,
spiders are like you and me.

933
01:23:12,064 --> 01:23:13,704
I frankly doubt the nest is there.

934
01:23:13,704 --> 01:23:15,984
I frankly know it is.

935
01:23:15,984 --> 01:23:19,264
I was in the barn.
I saw a web. There's a web.

936
01:23:19,264 --> 01:23:22,984
A web does indicate
an arachnoid presence.

937
01:23:22,984 --> 01:23:25,504
They got a saying
in Benelux countries...

938
01:23:25,504 --> 01:23:29,224
Just drive, Delbert.
Just get us there, please!

939
01:23:47,824 --> 01:23:51,544
My, you've been busy! Incredible!

940
01:24:18,664 --> 01:24:20,704
Supper's ready!

941
01:24:21,784 --> 01:24:22,864
Come and get it!

942
01:24:23,824 --> 01:24:25,264
HE SCREAMS

943
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:41,344
I gotta get my family out.
Destroy what's in the barn!

944
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:44,344
Check.
Better uncork my private stock.

945
01:24:44,344 --> 01:24:46,864
There may be spiders in the house!

946
01:24:46,864 --> 01:24:48,904
Yeah, right, let's go.

947
01:24:53,944 --> 01:24:58,264
Give me a minute to look around
here, then we go in.

948
01:25:02,224 --> 01:25:04,024
Hello-o-o!

949
01:25:06,504 --> 01:25:09,064
HE WHISTLES

950
01:25:11,464 --> 01:25:15,664
Hello-o-o! Trick or treat!

951
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:20,824
Hey!

952
01:25:25,224 --> 01:25:27,184
Gotcha! Got ya!

953
01:25:31,144 --> 01:25:34,144
Now, let's see what we got up here.

954
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:43,864
Aargh!

955
01:25:47,224 --> 01:25:50,904
Oh, my God!
They got the professor.

956
01:25:50,904 --> 01:25:51,424
'How come she's not here?

957
01:25:51,424 --> 01:25:55,984
'She had meetings...'

958
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:58,344
Honey!

959
01:25:58,344 --> 01:25:59,184
In here, Ross!

960
01:25:59,184 --> 01:26:00,384
Hi, Dad.

961
01:26:07,384 --> 01:26:12,624
I expected you for dinner,
I got worried.

962
01:26:12,624 --> 01:26:15,064
Sorry, I didn't get a chance to call.

963
01:26:19,024 --> 01:26:20,944
SHE GASPS

964
01:26:26,584 --> 01:26:28,144
OK, every...

965
01:26:41,064 --> 01:26:44,464
Everybody just get up,
very slowly...

966
01:26:52,824 --> 01:26:54,904
..and walk towards the door.

967
01:26:59,184 --> 01:27:01,264
OK, quick and quiet!

968
01:27:01,264 --> 01:27:04,624
We're gonna need
another way out of here.

969
01:27:06,904 --> 01:27:10,864
Upstairs...the bathroom.
Climb onto the roof. Quick!

970
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,024
Just go!

971
01:27:14,224 --> 01:27:16,024
Watch yourself, Ross!

972
01:27:18,184 --> 01:27:20,224
Come on, Shelley! That's right!

973
01:27:21,784 --> 01:27:24,024
Argh! Argh! Argh!

974
01:27:24,024 --> 01:27:25,824
Ross!

975
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:30,744
They're swarming!
I've never seen them so aggressive!

976
01:27:30,744 --> 01:27:32,104
They're chasing us.

977
01:27:32,104 --> 01:27:34,344
Hi, you guys. I'm Chris.

978
01:27:35,344 --> 01:27:36,904
Ah! Spiders!

979
01:27:37,944 --> 01:27:40,024
Put that under the door!

980
01:27:40,024 --> 01:27:42,064
Oh, God!

981
01:27:44,104 --> 01:27:45,664
Mom, where are we going?

982
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,464
I'll go first.

983
01:27:49,744 --> 01:27:50,544
Come on, let's go!

984
01:27:50,544 --> 01:27:51,544
Come on, Shelley!

985
01:27:51,544 --> 01:27:52,944
One at a time!

986
01:27:52,944 --> 01:27:54,064
Careful out there!

987
01:27:55,864 --> 01:27:57,504
Down the trellis, honey!

988
01:27:58,104 --> 01:27:59,104
Ross! Ross!

989
01:27:59,104 --> 01:28:00,424
Ross, get out of there!

990
01:28:03,424 --> 01:28:05,424
Wait for me! Tommy!

991
01:28:06,904 --> 01:28:08,944
Ross, get out of there!

992
01:28:13,864 --> 01:28:15,024
Where's Ross?

993
01:28:15,024 --> 01:28:17,104
Right behind me! Oh, no!

994
01:28:22,704 --> 01:28:23,824
Shit!

995
01:28:26,584 --> 01:28:28,704
BOTH: Spiders! Spiders!

996
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:31,144
Shelley, Tommy, come here!

997
01:28:31,144 --> 01:28:33,784
Get them away from the house!

998
01:28:40,344 --> 01:28:42,304
Rock and roll!

999
01:28:44,704 --> 01:28:46,744
MUFFLED: All right, party time!

1000
01:28:48,184 --> 01:28:50,184
Yeah! Yeah!

1001
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,864
Take that! Come on!

What is it?
Musty...musty smell, moist, dark...

1006
01:29:56,824 --> 01:30:00,784
No spiders. There's no spiders.

1007
01:30:01,864 --> 01:30:05,064
It's dark, musty. It's the nest.

1008
01:30:05,064 --> 01:30:07,024
Nest.

1009
01:30:07,624 --> 01:30:09,664
Nest. The queen.

1010
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:13,864
Oh, shit! I'm in the goddamn nest!

1011
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,664
Help! Help!

1012
01:30:22,744 --> 01:30:24,784

1013
01:30:24,784 --> 01:30:28,384
I found the nest!
And there's the queen!

1014
01:30:29,304 --> 01:30:31,264
Chris! Shit!

1015

The itsy-bitsy spider...

1037
01:35:51,424 --> 01:35:54,264
climbed up the water spout.

1038
01:35:54,264 --> 01:35:56,904
Down came the rain...

1039
01:35:56,904 --> 01:35:59,704
and washed the spider out.

1040

Ross, it's OK.

Everything's OK.

Jesus! God, spiders!

1054
01:38:36,184 --> 01:38:40,024
Most are dead. The ones
Delbert didn't get are dying.

1055
01:38:40,024 --> 01:38:41,224
The kids...?

1056
01:38:41,224 --> 01:38:44,344

Know what I'll miss
about the country?

1062
01:39:16,744 --> 01:39:18,064
What?

1063
01:39:18,064 --> 01:39:20,944
I dunno. That's why I'm asking.

1064
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,784
At least we got out with our lives.

1065
01:39:23,784 --> 01:39:25,744
Yes.

1066
01:39:26,784 --> 01:39:28,744
And the Margaux.

1067
01:39:30,424 --> 01:39:35,944
To office politics, Xmas bonuses,
caffeine, adrenaline...

1068
01:39:35,944 --> 01:39:39,544
To things we know,
events we can control...

1069
01:39:39,784 --> 01:39:41,344
RUMBLING

1070
01:39:51,904 --> 01:39:53,944
That was a minor tremor.

1071
01:39:53,944 --> 01:39:57,424
It wouldn't even show
on that scale...that...

1072
01:39:57,424 --> 01:39:59,464
Richter scale.

1073
01:39:59,464 --> 01:40:01,504
Just a cable car going by.
Cable car, yeah.

1074
01:40:01,504 --> 01:40:02,584
We should check the kids.

1075
01:40:02,584 --> 01:40:03,984
The kids!

1076
01:40:43,264 --> 01:40:46,024
