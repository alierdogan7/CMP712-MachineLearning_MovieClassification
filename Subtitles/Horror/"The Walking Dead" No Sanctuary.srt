Terminus...

00:00:04,753 --> 00:00:06,748
Tomorrow we go to the end of the line.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,931
Then, Washington.

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,924
I love you, Lizzie.

6
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,357
You don't need to stay.

7
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:14,816
We can't stay.

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,541
Just in case...

9
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:20,198
Welcome to Terminus!

10
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:23,351
Go to the train car. Now!

11
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:24,208
Rick!

12
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:27,292
They're gonna feel pretty stupid
when they find out

13
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:30,026
they screwed with the wrong people.

Alex: <i>We should never
have put up the signs.</i>

<i>What the hell did we</i>

18
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,040
We brought them here.

19
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:01,931
We were trying
to do something good.

20
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:05,507
- ( laughs )
- We were being human beings.

21
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:08,486
What are we now, Gareth?

22
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:11,092

Abraham: <i>They seemed nice
enough, but I was ready to go.</i>

25
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,838
<i>We just got here, but, damn,</i>

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,741

31
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:48,405
Sasha: <i>Before they put you in
here, you didn't see Tyreese?</i>

32
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,576
- Michonne:<i> No.</i>
- Sasha:<i> Good.</i>

33
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,046
Daryl: <i>Black car with a
white cross painted on it.</i>

34
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:55,584
<i>I tried to follow it.</i>
<i>I tried.</i>

35
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:57,223
Maggie:
<i>But she's alive?</i>

36
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:59,626
Daryl:

<i>Shut up!</i>

42
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,938
All right, got four of them
pricks coming our way.

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,079
Y'all know what to do.

44
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,148
Go for their eyes first.

45
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,415
Then their throats.

46
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,892
Man: <i>Put your backs to the walls

<i>( footsteps on roof )</i>

Hey, guys. What were
your shot counts?

59
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:34,187
- 38.

00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:47,801
Your shot count?

62
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,109
Crap, man, I'm sorry.

63
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,910
It was my first roundup.

64
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,745
<i>After you're done here,</i>
<i>go back to your point</i>

65
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,313

66
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:00,082
Kaylee won't be gathering
them until tomorrow.

67
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,816
( muffled ) Hey.

68
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:03,883
Hey, let me talk to you.

69
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:07,988
Four from A, four from D?

70
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,257
Man:
<i>Yeah.</i>

71
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,260
Hey, let me talk
to you for a minute.

72
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:13,593
Let me talk to you for a minute.

73
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,528
- Let me talk to you for a minute.
- What?

74
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,898
Don't do this.
We can fix this.

75
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,735
- No, you can't.
- You don't have to do this.

76
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:22,339
We told you there's a way
out of all this.

77
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,642
You just have to take a chance.

78
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,915
We have a man
who knows how to stop it.

79
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:33,182
He has a cure. We just have
to get him to Washington.

80
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,951
You don't have to do this, man.

81
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:37,052
We can put the world
back to how it was.

82
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:40,389
Can't go back, Bob.

83
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:42,424
We can!
You don't have to do this!

84
00:06:56,606 --> 00:06:59,371
We saw you go into
the woods with a bag

85
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:01,541
and come out without it.

86
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:04,413
Had to pull my spotters back
before we could go look for it.

87
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,513
What was in it?

88
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:11,615
You hid it, right?

89
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:14,118
In case things went bad?

90
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:18,391
Smart.

91
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:20,326
Still, we'll find it.

92
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:22,396
But it's too dangerous
to go out there right now.

93
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,074
What was in it?

94
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:34,944
I'm curious.

95
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:38,682
And it was a big bag.

96
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:45,055
You really gonna let me do this?

97
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:47,158
Well, let me take you out there.

98
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,562
I'll show you.

99
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,433
Not gonna happen.
This might.

100
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:54,368
Rick:
<i>There's guns in it.</i>

101
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:58,436
AK-47.

102
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,340
.44 Magnum.

103
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,215
Automatic weapons.
Nightscope.

104
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,550
There's a compound bow

105
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:10,755
and a machete with a red handle.

106
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,623
That's what I'm gonna
use to kill you.

107
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,295

108
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,631
( sighs )

109
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:27,634
Thanks.

110
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:30,537
You have two hours
to get them on the driers.

111
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,873
I'm gonna go back
to public face.

112
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,274
Now's the time we can get messy,

113
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,474
but we need to dial
it all in by sundown.

114
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:37,375
- Got it.
- Yes, sir.

<i>in six different directions.</i>

There was a lot

168
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,760
We need to set off our
charges all at the same time

169
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:34,829
to confuse the dead ones away.
That's good for you, too.

No, it isn't.

171
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:39,067
There's a herd heading
toward Terminus right now.

172
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,735
We don't want
to confuse them away.

00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,670
Back off!

363
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:13,238
Put your weapons on the ground.

364
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,739
Kick them over right now.
Right now!

365
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:22,808
Tyreese:
<i>Please.</i>

366
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:29,975
Please, don't.
Don't hurt her.

00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,079
Go outside.

Go outside!

370
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,115
Just one twist, man.

371
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:41,653
- Don't!
- Don't make me!

372
00:31:43,622 --> 00:31:46,556
( crying )

373
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:48,526
Go outside.

374
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,033
All right.

378
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,038
Cynthia, do you copy?

379
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,107
- <i> ( pounding )</i>

( grunts )

383
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:46,157
Yeah.
That's how it works.

384
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:49,804
I won't.

385
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:52,139

<i>( gunfire continues )</i>

391
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:33,635
What's the cure, Eugene?

392
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,870
It's classified.

393
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,439
We don't know
what's gonna happen.

394
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,148
Abraham:
You leave him be.

395
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,955
- We need to keep working.
- Yeah, but it's time to hear it.

396
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:46,526
'Cause we don't know
what's coming next.

397
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:49,863
What's next
is we get out of this.

398
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:51,233
Even if I told you all,

399
00:33:51,235 --> 00:33:53,203
even if I provided
step-by-step instructions

400
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:55,706
complete with illustrations
and a well-composed FAQ

401
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:58,709
and I went red-ring,

402
00:33:58,711 --> 00:34:00,711
the cure would still
die with me.

403
00:34:00,713 --> 00:34:02,913
I'm not gonna let that happen.

404
00:34:05,384 --> 00:34:07,751
The best-case scenario,
we step out into a hellstorm

405
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:09,722
of bullets, fire, and walkers.

406
00:34:09,724 --> 00:34:10,891
I'm not fleet of foot.

407
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:12,227
I sure as hell can't take
a dead one down

408
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:13,895
with sharp buttons
and hella confidence.

409
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:17,398
Yeah, but we can and we will.

410
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:22,033
You don't owe us anything.

411
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:24,403
Not yet.

412
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:26,770
But we just want to hear it.

413
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:28,604
You don't have to.

414
00:34:44,526 --> 00:34:46,062
I was part
of a 10-person team

415
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:48,364
at the Human Genome Project
to weaponize diseases

416
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:50,600
<i>to fight weaponized diseases.</i>

417
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:54,637
Pathogenic microorganisms
with pathogenic microorganisms.

418
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,539
Fire with fire.

419
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,575
<i>Interdepartmental</i>
<i>drinks were had,</i>

420
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:01,811
relationships made,
information shared.

421
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,880
I am keenly aware
of all the details

422
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:06,447
behind fail-safe
delivery systems

423
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,714
to kill every living
person on this planet.

424
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:11,453
I believe with a little tweaking
on the terminals in DC,

425
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:13,088
we can flip the script.

426
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,390
Take out every last
dead one of them.

427
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,426
Fire with fire.

428
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:28,839
All things being equal,
it does sound pretty badass.

429
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:31,437
So let's get back to work.

430
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:34,073

- Go, go, go!
- Carl!

00:35:43,884 --> 00:35:45,850
Come on.
Let's go!

435
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:23,715
Up and over.

436
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:26,150
Let's go! Move!

437
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,829
Man:
<i>Let's go! Move!</i>

<i>Come on!</i>

439
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,352
Right here.

Abraham: The hell are we
still around here for?

Rick:
<i>Guns, some supplies.</i>

442
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:10,502
<i>Go along the fences.</i>
<i>Use the rifles.</i>

443
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:12,739
<i>Take out the rest of 'em.</i>

444
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:14,541
What?

445
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:16,878
They don't get to live.

446
00:37:18,882 --> 00:37:21,885
Rick, we got out.
It's over.

447
00:37:23,754 --> 00:37:26,857
It's not over till
they're all dead.

448
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:29,026
The hell it isn't.
That place is on fire.

449
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:30,828
Full of walkers.

450
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,767
Abraham: <i>I'm not dicking
around with this crap.</i>

451
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,267
We just made it out.

452
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:36,368
The fences are down.

453
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,203
They'll run or die.

454
00:37:58,524 --> 00:38:00,524
( laughs )

455
00:38:26,684 --> 00:38:28,753
Did you do that?

00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:36,361

457
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,841
You have to come with me.

What happened?

464
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,273
There were a bunch
of walkers out here

465
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:16,144
and he got his hands
around Judith's neck.

466
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:18,145
No, he's dead.

467
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:21,782
I-- I had to.

468
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:23,083
So I did.

469
00:40:24,183 --> 00:40:25,650
I could.

470
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,992
I don't know if
the fire is still burning.

471
00:40:35,528 --> 00:40:36,828
It is.

472
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:42,031
Yeah. We need to go.

473
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,599
Daryl:
Yeah, but where?

474
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:45,401
Somewhere far away from there.

475
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,744
We'll talk to him.

476

No! No!

484
00:42:08,414 --> 00:42:11,450
It's okay.
It's okay.

We will.
