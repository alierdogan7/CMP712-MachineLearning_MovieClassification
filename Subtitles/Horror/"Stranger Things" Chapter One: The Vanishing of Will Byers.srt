00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,150
[Mike] Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

10
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,820
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

11
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,860
- It is almost here.
- What is it?

12
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,280
What if it's the Demogorgon?

13
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,410
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

14
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,530
It's not the Demogorgon.

15
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,870
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,080
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya. [chuckling]

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
- [snorts]
- [all chuckling]

18
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,960
[softly] Wait a minute.

19
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,590
Did you hear that?

20
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,090
That... that sound?

21
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,840
Boom... boom...

22
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,680
- [yells] Boom!
- [slams table]

23
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,696
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

24
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,390
That came from something else.

25
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,850
- The Demogorgon!
- [all groaning]

26
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,456
- We're in deep shit.
- Will, your action!

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,770
- I don't know!
- Fireball him!

28
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,150
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

29
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,070
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

30
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,690
- Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
- Cast Protection.

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,490
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

32
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,360
It stomps towards you.

33
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,450
- Boom!
- Fireball him!

34
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,830
- Another stomp, boom!
- Cast Protection.

35
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,750
- He roars in anger!
- [all clamoring]

36
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,330
- Fireball!
- [die clattering]

37
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,040
- Oh, shit!
- [Lucas] Where'd it go?

38
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,830
[Lucas] Where is it?
[Will] I don't know!

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,460
- Is it a 13?
- [Will] I don't know!

40
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,776
[Lucas] Where is it?
[Dustin] Oh, my God!

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,436
[Karen] Mike!
[Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,606
[Karen] Mike!
[Lucas] Can you find it yet?

43
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,720
[Will] No, I can't find it!

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,470
- Mike!
- [Dustin] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

45
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,340
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

46
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,550
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,810
[Lucas] Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
[Will] Why do we have to go?

48
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,600
- Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
- It's a school night, Michael.

49
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,150
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

50
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,830
- But that'll ruin the flow!
- Michael...

51
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,110
I'm serious, Mom.

52
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,650
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

53
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,716
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

54
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,610
You've been playing for ten hours?

55
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,740
- Dad, don't you think that 20 more...
- I think you should listen to your mother.

56
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,290
- [static crackling on TV]
- [grunts] Dang dumb piece of junk.

57
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,290
[Will] Oh, I got it!

58
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,250
- Does the seven count?
- It was a seven?

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,460
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

60
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,260
[Dustin] Yo, hey, guys.

61
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,220
- Does anyone want this?
- [both] No.

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,850
[Nancy] Yeah.

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,230
No, I don't think...

64
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,940
Yeah, he's cute.

65
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,360
Barb, no, I don't think so.

66
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,900
- Barb, you're not...
- Hey, Nancy.

67
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,216
There's a slice left if you want it.

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,580
- Sausage and pepperoni!
- Hold on.

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,380
- There's something wrong with your sister.
- What are you talking about?

70
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,316
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- [Lucas] Yeah.

71
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,860
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

72
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,720
[Dustin] Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,090
She's always been a real jerk.

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,050
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

75
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,576
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,810
[Mike] Four years ago!

77
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,350
[Dustin] Just saying.
[Lucas] Later.

78
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,980
- It was a seven.
- Huh?

79
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,810
The roll, it was a seven.

80
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,110
The Demogorgon, it got me.

81
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,150
[grunts] See you tomorrow.

82
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,840
[Lucas] Good night, ladies.
[Dustin] Kiss your mom 'night for me.

83
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,260
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

84
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,010
- Any comic?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,010
[Dustin] Hey! Hey!

86
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,060
I didn't say "go"!

87
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,150
Get back here!

88
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,360
I'm gonna kill you!

89
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,860
[Will] I'll take your <i>X-Men 134!</i>

90
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,700

It's time to get up.

Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

- I'm sure he just stayed over.

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,610
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

174
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,110
Will didn't spend the night?

175
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,620
[Karen] <i>No, he left here</i>
<i>a little bit after 8:00.</i>

176
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,040
Why? He's not home?

177
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,960
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

178
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
- Thank you so much. Bye.
<i>- Okay. Bye.</i>

179
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,390
[school bell ringing]

180
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,900
That's weird.
I don't see him.

181
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,586
[Lucas] I'm telling you, his mom's right.

182
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,440
He probably just
went to class early again.

183
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,086
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

184
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,030
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,370
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

186
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,080
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

187
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,750
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

188
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,010
[sighs]

189
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,340
[mimicking Dustin]
I'd go with Toothless.

190
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,890
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

191
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,720
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

192
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,810
[mimicking Dustin]
"I told you a million times."

193
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,930
- [chuckles]
- Do the arm thing.

194
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,060
Do it, freak!

195
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,320
- [bones cracking]
- [both groaning]

196
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,650
[Troy] God, it gets me every time.

197
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,820
- Assholes.
- [Mike] I think it's kinda cool.

198
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,080
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

199
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,040
Like Mr. Fantastic.

200
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,370
[Dustin] Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

201
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,460
[bell ringing]

202
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,510
[Barbara] So, did he call?

203
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,140
Keep your voice down.

204
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,800
Did he?

205
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,640
I told you, it's not like that.

206
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,980
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

207
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,980
We just...

208
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,610
made out a couple times.

209
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,070
"We just... made out a couple times."

210
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,490
Nance, seriously,

211
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,650
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

212
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,160
No, I'm not.

213
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,910
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

214
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,790
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol...

215
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,160
Oh, that's gross!

216
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,420
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

217
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,340
- Two-time thing.
- [chuckles]

218
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,470
You were saying?

219
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,350
- Steve...
- Mmm-hmm?

220
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,110
- I have to go.
- In a minute.

221
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,480
[bell ringing]

222
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,860
Steve.
I really, like...

223
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,780
Seriously, I have to go.

224
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,240
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

225
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,200
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

226
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,200
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

227
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,540
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

228
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,330
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

229
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,580
- Well, then, just let me help.
- You failed chem.

230
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,670
- C-minus.
- Well, in that case...

231
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,090
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

232
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,130
- Are you crazy? My mom would not...
- I'll climb through your window.

233
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,446
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

234
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,720
You are crazy.

235
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,696
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

236
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,010
We can just...

237
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,020
We can just, like, chill in my car.

238
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,060
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

239
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,560
Steve... I have to study.

240
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,360
I'm not kidding.

241
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,730
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

242
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,490
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

243
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,120
[sighs]

244
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,040
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

245
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,250
To study.

246
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,420
[bell ringing]

247
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,760
Good of you to show.

248
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,520
[Hopper slurring] Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

249
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,270
- Hey, Chief.
- Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

250
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,416
- Oh, yeah?
- [chuckles] Yeah.

251
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,040
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

252
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,070
[officers laughing]

253
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,690
While you were drinking or sleeping,

254
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,740
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

255
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Phil Larson called.

256
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,580
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

257
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,120
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

258
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,460
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

259
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,080
On a more pressing matter,

260
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,210
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

261
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,050
[muffled] Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

262
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,340
- Just give me a minute.
- Joyce is very upset.

263
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,300
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

264
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,720
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

265
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,680
- Chief, she's already in your...
- Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

266
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,940
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

267
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,610
[sighs deeply] And I apologize again.

268
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,070
I'm going out of my mind!

269
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,740
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

270
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,830
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

271
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,516
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well, you never know.

272
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,306
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

273
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,976
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,670
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

275
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,710
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

276
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,300
He's not like... most.

277
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,260
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

278
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,180
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

279
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,310
- They laugh at him, his clothes...
- His clothes?

280
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,350
- What's wrong with his clothes?
- I don't know.

281
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,730
- Does that matter?
- Maybe.

282
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,860
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

283
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,650
Lonnie... [sighs]
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

284
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,070
[softy] Called him a fag.

285
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,070
- Is he?
- He's missing is what he is.

286
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,950
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

287
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,080
[scoffs]

288
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,420
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

289
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,316
- But he has nothing to do with this.
- Why don't you give me his number?

290
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,276
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

291
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,510
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

292
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,720
the kid is with a parent or relative.

293
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,310
[stammers] What about the other time?

294
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,730
- What?
- You said, "99 out of 100."

295
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,850
- What about the other time, the one?
- Joyce.

296
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,060
The one!

297
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,980
- Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
- [sighs]

298
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,876
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

299
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,046
in the four years I've been working here?

300
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,296
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

301
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,450
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

302
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,250
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

303
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,990
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

304
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,790
He will talk to me before he talks to...

305
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,830
- What, a pig?
- A cop!

306
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,920
[voice breaking] Just find my son, Hop.

307
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,880
Find him!

308
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,640
[man] Dr. Brenner.

309
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,270
[scientist] This way, gentlemen.

310
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,190
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

311
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,110
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

312
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,950
[air hissing]

313
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,170
[guns cocking]

314
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,930
[elevator humming]

315
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,060
[elevator thuds]

316
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,980
[squelching]

317
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,660
[low growling]

318
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
[indistinct growling]

319
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,930
[man 1] This is where it came from?
[man 2] Yes.

320
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,010
[man 1] And the girl?

321
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,760
She can't have gone far.

322
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,600
[growls]

323
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,430
[music playing faintly]

324
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,740
[Ben] All right, and one more.

325
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,676
[man] Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

326
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,240
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

327
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,660
[man] I don't know,
37 points per game average...

328
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,620
[Ben] Thirty-seven now, but...
[man] Mr. Basket.

329
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,060
[indistinct chatter]

330
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,110
Hey!

331
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,320
Come here!

332
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,360
Hey, come here!

333
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,080
You think you can steal from me, boy?

334
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,750
What in the hell?

335
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,130
- [bell ringing]
- [Mr. Clarke] Remember, finish chapter 12

336
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,010
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

337
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,220
and other forms of science investigation.

338
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,180
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

339
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,310
[trailing off] It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

340
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,350
So, did it come?

341
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,810
Sorry, boys.

342
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,770
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

343
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,980
it came.

344
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,490
Yes!

345
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,360
The Heathkit ham shack.

346
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,966
[Mike] Whoa.
[Mr. Clarke] Ain't she a beaut?

347
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,030
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

348
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,290
Think bigger.

349
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,370
- California?
- Bigger.

350
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,830
Australia?

351
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,370
- [boys exclaiming]
- [Lucas] Oh, man!

352
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,340
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

353
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,500
Lucas!

354
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,960
- Sorry.
- [Dustin chuckles]

356
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,930
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

357
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,720
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

358
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,470
[Lucas] What are you doing?

359
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,786
[in Australian accent]
Hello, this is Dustin,

360
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,810
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

361
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,060
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

362
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,150
- [Mike laughs]
- [knock on door]

363
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,070
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

364
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,820
[overlapping chatter]

365
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,620
Okay, okay, okay.

366
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,660
One at a time, all right?
You.

367
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,380
- You said he takes what?
- Mirkwood.

368
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,040
- Mirkwood?
- Yeah.

369
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,630
- Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
- I have not. That sounds made up to me.

370
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,510
No, it's from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

371
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,470
- Well, <i>The Hobbit.</i>
- It doesn't matter.

372
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,390
- He asked!
- [mockingly] "He asked!"

373
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,060
- [Mike] Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

374
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,100
- What'd I just say?
- Shut up.

375
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,480
One at a damn time.
You.

376
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,770
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

377
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,296
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

378
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,876
- Yeah, all right, I think I know that...
- We can show you, if you want.

379
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,240
I said that I know it!

380
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,240
- We can help look.
- Yeah.

381
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,240
- No.
- [boys clamoring]

382
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,450
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

383
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,750
Immediately.

384
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,620
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

385
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,790
no nonsense.

386
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,840
This isn't some <i>Lord of the Rings</i> book.

387
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,710
<i>- The Hobbit.</i>
- Shut up!

388
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,170
- Hey!
- [Mike] Stop it!

389
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,380
[boys bickering]

390
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,390
[softly] Do I make myself clear?

391
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,150
Do I make myself... clear?

392
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,940
[Mike and Dustin] Yes, sir.
[Lucas] Yeah.

393
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,490
Ring-a-ding-ding!

394
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,290
Anybody home?

395
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,000
[Will] Password?

396
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,040
Uh, Rada...

397
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,880
[stammering] Radaga... Radagast?

398
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,380
[Will] Yeah. You may enter.

399
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,930
[Joyce] Thank you, sir.

400
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,550
So, guess what?

401
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,100
I got off early and...

402
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,850
Ta-da!
<i>Poltergeist.</i>

403
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,536
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

404
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,940
I changed my mind.

405
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,860
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

406
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,400
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

407
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,490
Oh, yeah?

408
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,240
Not even of clowns?

409
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,400
No.

410
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,870
What about my witch?

411
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,370
- No. Mom...
- Ooh...

412
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,290
- I'm not five anymore.
- But Will Byers...

413
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,970
- I'm going to cook you up in my...
- Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

414
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,120
[sighs]

415
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,290
[Jonathan] Will?

416
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,960
- [shouting] Will?
- Will?

417
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,760
Will?

418
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,300
- Will?
- Will!

419
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,100
- [Jonathan] Will!
- Will?

420
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,720
[Joyce] Will!

421
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,480
Where are you?

422
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,070
Geez.

423
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,700
Your parents forget to feed you?

424
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,200
Is that why you ran away?

425
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,870
They, uh...

426
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,040
They hurt you?

427
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,630
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

428
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,390
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

429
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,640
All right.

430
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,850
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

431
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,960
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

432
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,380
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

433
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,440
We got a deal?

434
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,070
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

435
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,530
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

436
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,330
See? Like this. Here.

437
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,330
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

438
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,880
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

439
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,000
[sighing]

441
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,260
Eleven?

442
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,600
What's that mean?

443
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,220
What's it mean?

444
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,560
- No.
- Well, I'll be damned.

445
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,350
She speaks.

446
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,110
"No"? No, what?

447
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,900
[clicks tongue] All right.
I guess no more food, then.

448
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,150
Eleven.

449
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,570
Yeah.

450
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,450
What's it mean?

451
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,620
Eleven.

452
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,500
All right, then.

453
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,330
[chuckles] Here you go.

454
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,170
Take it easy, take it easy.

455
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,460
[sighs]

456
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,170
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

457
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,380
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

458
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,090
kidnapped or something.

459
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,180
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

460
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,730
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

- Hey! I got something.

471
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,290
- That his bike?
- Yeah, he must have crashed.

472
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,340
[Callahan] You think
he got hurt in the fall?

473
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,620
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

474
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,630
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

475
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,340
He would've walked it home.

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,830
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- [Jonathan] Yeah.

514
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,250
So...

515
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,370
maybe he came home.

516
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,500
[stammers] You think I didn't check
my own house?

517
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,380
I'm not saying that.

518
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,050
- Has this always been here?
- [Joyce] What? I don't know.

519
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,970
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

520
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,760
You're not sure?

521
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,930
- [Joyce sighs]
- [dog barking]

522
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,850
[barks]

523
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,730
Hey.

524
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,110
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

525
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,700
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

526
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,010
[indistinct squelching]

527
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,310
[squelching stops]

528
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,320
- [Callahan] Hey!
- Jesus!

529
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,990
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

530
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,530
- [exhales]
- What's going on?

531
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,830
Hello?

532
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,000
- Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
- Listen, I want you to call Flo.

533
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,476
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

534
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,630
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

535
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,000
[Callahan] Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

536
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,866
[Mike] We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

537
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,770
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says...

538
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,406
- I don't care what the chief said.
- Michael!

539
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,166
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

540
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,400
More reason to stay put.

541
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,520
- Mom!
- End of discussion.

542
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,660
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

543
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,160
- That's cool, right?
- No, not cool.

544
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,490
What? Why not?

545
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,790
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

546
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,920
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

547
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,790
- This is such bullshit.
- Language.

548
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,290
So we're under house arrest?

549
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,356
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

550
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,670
- Wait, this is Will's fault?
- Nancy, take that back.

551
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,300
- No!
- You're just pissed off

552
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,340
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

553
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,220
- Steve?
- Who is Steve?

554
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,720
- Her new boyfriend.
- You are such a douchebag, Mike!

555
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,600
- Language!
- [groans]

556
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,690
Nancy, come back.

557
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,770
Come back!

558
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,280
[sighs] It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

559
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,030
You see, Michael?

560
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,466
- You see what happens?
- [shouting] What happens when what?

561
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,080
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

562
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,200
That is really unfair, son.

563
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,500
We care.

564
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,290
[sighs]

565
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,170
- Mike!
- Let him go.

566
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,300
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

567
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,590
What did I do?

568
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,510
Hey! What'd I do?

569
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,600
[boy] Will!
[man 1] Will Byers!

570
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,730
[man 2] Will!

571
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,650
[woman] Will, we're here for you, bud!

572
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,520
[volunteers shouting indistinctly]

573
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,740
[Mr. Clarke] He's a good student.

574
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,240
- [Hopper] What?
- Will. He's a good student.

575
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,950
Great one, actually.

576
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,370
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

577
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,750
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

578
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,830
[Hopper] I always had
a distaste for science.

579
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,880
[Mr. Clarke] Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

580
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,300
[Hopper] Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

581
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,010
[Mr. Clarke chuckles] Ratliff?
You bet.

582
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,260
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

583
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,140
[Hopper] Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

584
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,260
Sarah, my daughter...

585
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,810
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

586
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,360
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

587
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,190
I never needed to look elsewhere.

588
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,530
[Mr. Clarke] Your daughter,
what grade is she?

589
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,360
- Maybe I'll get her in my class.
- No, she, uh...

590
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,990
She lives with her mom in the city.

591
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,540
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

592
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,620
- She died a few years back.
- Sorry?

593
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,960
His kid.

594
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,970
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

595
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,890
<i>- Lucas?</i>
- Hey, it's Lucas.

596
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
I know it's you.

597
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,230
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

598
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,940
I'm done. Over.

599
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,440
I'm worried about Will. Over.

600
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,570
[sighs] Yeah.

601
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,320
This is crazy. Over.

602
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,030
I was thinking...

603
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,370
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

604
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,460
He cast Fireball.

605
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,290
<i>- Over.</i>
- What's your point? Over.

606
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,090
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

607
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,050
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

608
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,260
<i>Over.</i>

609
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,470
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

612
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,356
[whispers] What are you doing here?

613
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,670
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

614
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,590
- I figured we'd just study here.
- No. No way.

615
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,930
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

616
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,810
So just... bear with me.

617
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,180
[window rattles]

618
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,850
What'd I tell you?

619
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,400
Ninja.

You like that ice cream, huh?

623
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,580
Smile looks good on you.

624
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,000
You know, smile?

625
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,880
- [chuckles]

[knocking on door]

627
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,760
All right.
You just sit tight.

628
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,220
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

629
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,100
- [knocking continues]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

630
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,730
- Hey, can I help you?
- Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

631
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,126
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

632
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,900
- So try back tomorrow morning.
- Connie Frazier. Social Services.

633
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,860
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

634
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,780
- That's a heck of a drive.
- Not too bad this time of night.

635
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,176
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

636
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,160
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

637
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,880
- Children I work with usually are.
- Right, right.

638
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,300
- So, where is she?
- Right. She's in the kitchen.

639
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,210
- Come on up. I'll introduce you.
- Thank you.

640
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,100
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

641
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,276
- It's fine.
- You know, it's funny.

642
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,860

Hey, guys.
You feel that?

652
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,770
- I think maybe we should go back.
- No.

653
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,480
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

654
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,690
Come on.

00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,160
[whispers] Steve.
Steve, come on.

683
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
What?

684
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,450
Are you crazy?
My parents are here.

685
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,660
That's weird, I... don't see them.

686
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,170
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

687
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,840
- get another notch on your belt.
- No. Nancy, no.

688
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,050
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

689
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,720
You mean, you're not a slut.

690
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,640
That's not what I'm saying.

691
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,470
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

692
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,230
Shut up.

693
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,480
Bad Steve.

694
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,110
[groans] Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

695
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,740
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

696
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,700
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

697
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,040
[Steve grunts]

698
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,710
"Compared to the rate
of inorganic reactions,

699
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,540
the rate of organic reactions
is generally..."

700
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,090
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain falling]

701
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,590
[Joyce] Jonathan, wow.
You took these?

702
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,010
These are great.

703
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,100
[sniffling] Wow, they really are.

704
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,350
I know I haven't been there for you.
[stammers] I've been...

705
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,520
working so hard and I...

706
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,440
I just feel bad.
I don't even...

707
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,980
barely know what's going on with you.
[chuckles]

708
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,820
All right?
I am sorry about that.

709
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,200
[Jonathan sobs softly]

710
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,490
Hey, what is it?

711
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,740
What is it, honey?

712
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,910
- Nothing. [sniffles]
- Tell me. Tell me.

713
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,040
- Come on. You can...
- No.

714
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,290
It's just...

715
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,356
[voice breaking]
I should've been there for him.

716
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,380
[hoarsely] No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

717
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,680
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

718
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,430
He is... close.
I know it. [stammers] I...

719
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,810
I feel it in my heart.
[sniffles]

720
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,350
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

721
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,690
[sniffles]

722
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,780
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at this.

723
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,240
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

724
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,650
[both laugh]

725
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,740
- I mean, that's it, right?
- Yeah.

726
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,620
[hoarsely] That's it.
That's the one.

727
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,160
- [sighs]
- [phone ringing]

728
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,120
- Hello?
- [static on phone]

729
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,830
- Hello?
- [static continues]

730
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,960
Lonnie?

731
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,800
- Dad?
- Hopper?

732
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,920
- [muffled breathing on phone]
- Who is this?

733
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,840
[breathing continues]

734
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,260
Will?

735
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,220
- Will?
- It's Will?

736
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,970
- [scrambled voice chitters]
- [static]

737
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,430
- [sobs]
- Mom, it's Will?

738
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,916
- [yelling] Who is this?
- [indistinct growling]

739
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,100
- [yelling] What have you done to my boy?
- What? What?

740
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,650
Give me back my son!

741
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,520
- [electricity surges]
- [screams]

742
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,440
- [groans]
- Hello?

743
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,780
Hello, who is this?

744
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,610
- Hello? Who is this?
- [sobbing]

745
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,160
- Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?
- [muttering incoherently]

746
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,966
- [sobbing] It was him.
- Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

747
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,200
- Yes.
- What did he say?

748
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,410
[sobbing] He just breathed.
He just breathed.

749
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,460
- [Jonathan] And was someone else there?
- I...

750
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,250
- Mom, who was there? Who was it?
- It was him.

751
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,050
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

752
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,260
[sobbing]

753
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,720
- [thunder rumbling]
- [Mike] Will!

754
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,220
- Will!
- [Lucas] Byers!

755
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,060
[Dustin] I've got your <i>X-Men 134!</i>

756
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,890
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

757
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,230
[Lucas] Seriously, Dustin?

758
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,600
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

759
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,400
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

760
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,480
No, you're just being a big sissy!

761
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:37,490
[Dustin] Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

762
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,450
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

763
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,370
- And we have no weapons or anything?
- Dustin, shut up.

764
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,450
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

765
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,660
- Shut up. Shut up.
- [rustling]

766
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,410
Did you guys hear that?

767
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,880
- [rustling]
- [indistinct screeching]

768
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,590
- [rustling]
- [boys gasp]

769
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,980
