This is what is known,

there has always been man

11
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:58,564

14
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:12,634
Since the beginning, the two
have been locked in conflict.

15
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,814
The vampires were quicker,
stronger,

16
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,551
but man had the sun.

17
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,896
It was not enough.

18
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:52,415
And so it went
like this over many years.

19
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:56,249
The two races destroying
not only each other,

20
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:58,982
but the world itself.

00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:03,156
Facing extinction,

mankind withdrew behind walled Cities
under the protection of the Church.

23
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:13,672
And then the ultimate
weapon was found,

24
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:15,305
the Priests.

25
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:25,451
Warriors with
extraordinary powers,

26
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:29,316
trained by the Church
in the art of vampire combat.

27
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,118
They alone turned
the tide for man.

28
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:38,764
The remaining vampires
were placed on reservations.

29
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,328
And, fearing the power
of the weapon they created,

30
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:46,302
the ruling Clergy
ordered the Priests disbanded.

31
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:50,943
The former warriors to be
integrated back into a society,

32
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,104
that no longer needed them.

33
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:57,680
And as the years passed,

34
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:02,316
the few surviving Priests
faded into obscurity

35
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,182
like the vampire menace
before them.

still spotty,

close to zero.

a life outside this outpost.

The boy was mistaken.

walls is absolute.

in the Church's ability
to keep them safe.

175
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,430
You will not shake that faith.

176

If you take any action
to leave the Cities,

179
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,742

myself clear, Father?

183
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:12,689
Yes, Monsignor.

184
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,761
Try to remember your vow,

185
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:22,497
to go against the Church
is to go against God.

Don't be shy.

189

you'll be torn apart.

He'll come after me.

196
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:09,484
Really?

197
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:11,713
What makes you so sure?

198
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:13,855
He'll come after me.

I'm absolutely

I sacrificed everything
to serve them.

205

Now they won't listen to me.

206

207

You and the other Priests
did your jobs.

208

It's not over.
Not for me.

209
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:53,995
You can't break your covenant to hunt
down a small group of scavengers.

210
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,260
It would be sacrilege.

211
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,068
I have to.

212

we have left.

with the help of your grace

230
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:34,030

the near occasions of sin,

why I should.

I don't blame any
of you for bein' scared,

261

but the vampires are gone
and they're not comin' back.

262
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:26,929
You'll have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't too common out here.

263
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:31,969
Is it true what they say
about Priests?

268
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,762
and returned an old man.

After the war was over, Shannon
figured you'd come back.

00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:20,976
I couldn't save her.

273
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:26,785
I tried, but I never
had your gift.

274
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,854
You gave her a life
I no longer could.

275
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,860
I will always be
grateful to you for that.

276
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:39,537
Never a day went by when I didn't
wish she'd forget about you.

277
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,283
You find Lucy.

278
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:55,112
You bring her home safe.

279
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,817
And you promise me
somethin', brother,

280
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:02,059
kill 'em all.

281
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:11,533
Most people out here know the Clergy think
of us as a bunch of godless heathens.

282
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:13,366
And that's how we like it.

283
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:16,168
It means they tend to keep their
noses out of our business.

284
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,875
So you can imagine
how surprised I was

285
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:21,912
when they contacted me
askin' if I'd seen you.

286
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:26,147

is to be arrested immediately.

Said she's in God's hands now.

288
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:35,492
Problem is, we both know outside
of a week, Lucy will be dead.

Or worse, infected.

290
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:40,222

respect to God...

cutting me out of this.

came and got you.

294

you can keep them safe here.

you'll do any good out there?

296

297
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:23,866
