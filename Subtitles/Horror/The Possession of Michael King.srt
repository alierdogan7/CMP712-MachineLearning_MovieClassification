1
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,525
Oh, my God. Enough, camera addict.

2
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,068
MAN:
Okay, okay. Just a second, though.

3
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,195
Before I turn it off, what is
your New Year's resolution?

4
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,821
Ha! Really?

5
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,199
Yeah, I want to get it on tape
so that I can hold you to it.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,617
Please, you don't keep those.

7
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,827
That is a fantastic attitude
you have right there.

8
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,329
We're going to this time.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,831
Yeah? All right, fine.
(CLEARS THROAT)

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,292
I solemnly swear

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,878
on this New Year's resolution

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,631
to go to the gym and get in shape.

13
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,966
Oh, hell, yeah.

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,260
How about you, ladybug?
What's your New Year's resolution?

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,636
What's that?

16
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,473
It's like a vow or a promise that
you make to be a better person.

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,725
Yeah, or always eat your spinach.

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,644
- Yuck.
- Okay, I got one for you.

19
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,230
How about you tell your mommy that
you love her at least once a day?

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,607
- Okay.
- You can start right now.

21
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,901
- I love you, Mom.
- How about you, Fishbone?

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,653
What's your resolution?

23
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,863
- Your turn.
- My resolution.

24
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,991
To make a documentary
about this family

25
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,867
so that I can show the whole world

26
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,578
what a lucky guy I am.

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,288
- WOMAN: You are a lucky guy.
- That's right.

28
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,456
And I thank God every day.

29
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,208
If only you believed in God.

30
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,835
Yeah, that'd probably
help a little bit.

31
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,420
Oh, crap. You know what?

32
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,380
I didn't put change in that meter.
We're gonna get a ticket.

33
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,757
- Dad, can you help me?
- What's up?

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,925
- Here, I got it.
- You sure?

35
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,803
- Yup.
- Thanks, babe.

36
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,853
So, Beverly, your psychic powers,

37
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,813
when did you first discover them?

38
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,691
Well, everyone's born
with them, you know.

39
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,278
But most folks don't know
how to develop them.

40
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,364
MAN: And your predictions, how many
of them you think have come true?

41
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,950
Well, all of them.

42
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,493
(LAUGHS)

43
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,621
MAN: Have you ever felt
like you were preying

44
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,497
on someone's superstitions?

45
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,333
Or their emotions?

46
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,501
You know, for example,
like telling a mother

47
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,046
that her missing son
would return alive

48
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,174
or breaking up a family
by advising for divorce.

49
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,717
You know what I mean?
Have you ever felt like

50
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,219
you led somebody
down the wrong path?

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,555
No, I don't think so.

52
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,474
You know, it's interesting,

53
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,060
my wife, she's always
wanted to go to Europe.

54
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,187
I finally put this
big trip together,

55
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,023
then at the last
second, she cancels.

56
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,067
She says that she needed to be here

57
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,903
for this big break in
her acting career.

58
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,365
A break that you
told her was coming.

59
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,868
I did.

60
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,163
And I'm guessing it hasn't, huh?

61
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,416
No.

62
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,377
It will.

63
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,087
Yeah, I don't think so.

64
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,761
And why is that?

65
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,265
She's dead.

66
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,140
Her name was Samantha.
Samantha King.

67
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,643
Yeah. She'd been coming
to you for years.

68
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,521
Oh, Sa...

69
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,065
oh, Samantha. Oh, gosh.

70
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,484
Fluke accident. Wrong
place, wrong time.

71
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,112
But, you know, the funny thing is

72
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:20,616
is that if we'd been on that trip,

73
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,994
if she hadn't listened to you
and we'd gone to Europe,

74
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,830
she'd still be alive.

75
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,873
Oh, God.

76
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,625
Oh, you can't think that I had...

77
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,212
You were giving her
spiritual guidance.

78
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,132
Guidance based on visions
you were receiving

79
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,009
from beyond the veil, from
higher powers, right?

80
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,344
And these visions,

81
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,974
they interfered with
her life, Beverly.

82
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,851
And she is dead as a direct result.

83
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,438
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

84
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,356
Okay, then admit it. Admit it.

85
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,359
Admit that all this,
this is just a scam.

86
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,613
That what you claim to do,
your psychic routine...

87
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,657
this is just a show, right?

88
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,160
This is a performance here.

89
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,498
Come on, Beverly. Come on.

90
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,378
I'm afraid that I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

91
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,132
Please?

92
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,020
MAN: What happens when you die?

93
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,390
I mean, everybody has
a theory, a guess,

94
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,184
a story that they'd
like to believe.

95
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,562
But at the end of the
day, we don't know.

96
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,356
Our ancestors worshiped fire

97
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,906
and sacrificed children
to vengeful gods.

98
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,030
We didn't know any
better back then.

99
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,449
What's our excuse now?

100
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,034
It's the 21st century,

101
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,078
yet we're still arguing
evolution versus creationism.

102
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,914
And why?

103
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,385
Because the truth scares people.

104
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,462
Nobody wants to die.

105
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,381
Nobody wants to cease to exist.

106
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,760
We want to believe that if
we follow a set of rules,

107
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,347
rules that were laid out by
some ancient, made-up god,

108
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,683
we're gonna continue on
in heaven as a spirit.

109
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,061
We're gonna be reincarnated.

110
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,564
While all that sounds great,

111
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,608
is any of it authentic?

112
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,827
I mean, what's the truth?

113
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,405
See, the truth is that
religion and spiritualism

114
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,867
are the most profitable
businesses in the world.

115
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,577
That throughout history,

116
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,913
there's never been a
single shred of evidence

117
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,508
that any of it is real.

118
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,961
Well, I've decided to prove it.

119
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,588
I want to test the
most authentic spells,

120
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,638
rituals, and summonings
that I can find.

121
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,679
I'm only going after the
blackest of the black magic.

122
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,640
The stuff that people
are scared of.

123
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,392
So that when they don't work,

124
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,185
people will pay attention.

125
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,895
And maybe, just maybe,

126
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,276
the world can take a step
forward collectively into reality.

127
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,989
The cameras will be
rolling on me 24/7

128
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,658
in the hopes that if
I uncover anything,

129
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,410
anything at all,

130
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:14,337
I'll have found the first
ever documented proof.

131
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,585
I'm the testing ground.

132
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,337
Me, Michael King.

133
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,341
So, God or the devil,

134
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,468
if you're out there,

135
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,137
prove it.

136
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,515
Come and get me.

137
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,022
Ladybug, what are you doing?

138
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,150
Why are you up?

139
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,610
I had a scary dream.

140
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,988
Uh-oh. Come here.
What was it about?

141
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,656
A monster.

142
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,367
A monster? Okay.

143
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,788
Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if this particular monster

144
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,167
is a tickle monster.

145
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,501
- (GROWLS)
- (LAUGHING)

146
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,045
Come on. Come here, come here.

147
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,796
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

148
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,007
See, Fishbone's right.
Old Crowley here...

149
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,551
old Crowley here is the best
defense against tickle monsters.

150
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,970
- Get away! Get away!
- What are you doing?

151
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,263
- Hey, sis.
- What's going on?

152
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,350
Oh, we are... she had a nightmare.

153
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,935
Yeah, take Crowley with you.

154
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,770
Hey, listen.

155
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,022
Why don't I get in bed with you

156
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,857
and make sure that there
are no more monsters?

157
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,192
- Okay.
- Okay?

158
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,652
I think that's a great idea.

159
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,528
I'm really good at
fending off monsters.

160
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,697
Aunt Beth is the best.
Hey, young lady.

161
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,366
Where do you think you're going?

162
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,245
Are you okay?
All right, give me kisses.

163
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,704
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Dad.

164
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,081
Crowley's gonna take
care of you, okay?

165
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,832
- And Fishbone.
- Okay.

166
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,044
What is all this stuff, Michael?

167
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,713
I mean, you wonder why she's
getting all these nightmares?

168
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,298
Seriously?

169
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,093
It's my new project.

170
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,720
Oh, right.

171
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,222
What?

172
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,557
I thought that you would
be happy, of all people,

173
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,902
to see me, you know, getting
back to work and moving on.

174
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,816
This isn't really
moving on, Michael.

175
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,486
- Well, it is for me.
- Okay.

176
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,113
I'm gonna go put her to bed.

177
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,782
Okay, so last night I posted an ad.

178
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,743
Documentary filmmaker seeks
proof of the supernatural.

179
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,247
There must be, I don't know, over
300 hits on this thing already.

180
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,791
We've got Satanists,
voodoo, necromancy.

181
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,584
I even have a priest on here.

182
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,837
I guess that's Los
Angeles for you, right?

183
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,172
We're gonna have no shortage
of material, that's for sure.

184
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,550
CAMERAMAN: What if one of these
fucking Satanists is a serial killer?

185
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,010
- What then?
- Are you serious?

186
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,679
Don't be such a pussy.

187
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,348
So, Father Gibbons,

188
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,892
the Church won't talk
about it publicly,

189
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,854
but behind closed doors you claim

190
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,107
they're performing exorcisms.

191
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,317
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

192
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,446
Okay. And these demons
that they're exorcising,

193
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,906
is there any proof
that they're real?

194
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,450
A physical proof?

195
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,119
Like horns and brimstone?

196
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,288
Fire, that kind of thing?

197
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,623
Well, any kind of thing.

198
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,795
I just don't understand why there's
never been any documented evidence.

199
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,131
What makes you think there's not?

200
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,216
I haven't seen any.

201
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,885
Well, I mean, of
course you haven't.

202
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,184
You haven't been allowed to.

203
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,725
Okay, listen, you
stated in your e-mail

204
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:24,605
that you had a real
experience, real proof,

205
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,649
but you don't, do you?

206
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,743
Okay.

207
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,654
When I was 10,

208
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,702
my father...

209
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,911
he started to take advantage of me.

210
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,413
Every night he would
come into my room...

211
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,998
(BELLS TOLLING)

212
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,501
close the door...

213
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,422
My mother, she must have known.

214
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,841
She prayed all the time.

215
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,135
That was her remedy.

216
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,513
God.

217
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,264
Well, I prayed to God,

218
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,851
but He never stopped
my father, not once.

219
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,276
So I gave up on God.

220
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,946
Started to pray to the devil.
(COUGHS)

221
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,444
Told him I would do anything

222
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,039
if he'd just make my father stop.

223
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,035
Well, one night not long after,

224
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,037
in the middle of one of his visits,

225
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,207
my father had a heart attack.

226
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,961
Died on the spot.

227
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,754
Wow.

228
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,590
That's awful.

229
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,969
I mean, what happened
to you, it's awful.

230
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,679
But come on.

231
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,809
I mean, how is that anything more
than just a strange coincidence?

232
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,189
Well, not long after, I...

233
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,734
began to hear him

234
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,778
calling out to me,

235
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,321
saying things.

236
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,241
I mean, awful, awful things.

237
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,744
The devil?

238
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,627
You hear him...

239
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,089
you don't answer.

240
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,462
Because if you do, he will
know you're listening

241
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,934
and he will never let you go.

242
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,429
MICHAEL: Hmm.

243
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,773
Right.

244
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,936
Thank you for your time.
Appreciate it.

245
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,858
I ordered a demon summoning
kit off the Internet.

246
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,446
I lit the traditionally
evil-looking black candles.

247
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,615
I even sprung for the
expensive incense

248
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,326
because their Internet site said

249
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,831
that the demons get insulted
by the cheap stuff.

250
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,584
Got one plastic ritual altar.

251
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,461
Nice. Very nice.

252
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,714
And one photocopied booklet.

253
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,842
A lot of money went into
that guy right there, huh?

254
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,221
I also used Ellie's coloring
set to draw my symbols.

255
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,224
Somehow crayons seemed appropriate.

256
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,100
So basically what you do is this.

257
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,394
You draw the symbol

258
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,689
for the demon that
you wish to summon.

259
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,358
All right?

260
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,612
You read the spell from this.

261
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,823
Then you light it,

262
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,659
put it in the altar.

263
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,494
Voila.

264
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,043
(FRENCH ACCENT) Instant demon.

265
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,540
Well, surprise, surprise,

266
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,169
the demons were a no-show.

267
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,672
Although...

268
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,143
(GROANS) ...something's happening.

269
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,138
(GROWLS)

270
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,307
Okay, there's no demon.

271
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,685
It was worth a shot.

272
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,108
So we got in touch
with a demonologist.

273
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,653
And after negotiating a small...
well, smallish... fee,

274
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,322
we've convinced him to
summon a demon for us.

275
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,825
- (KNOCKS)
- MAN: Just a sec.

276
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,036
Hi. Michael King.

277
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,122
This is Jordan.

278
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,040
So why do people
always summon demons,

279
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,959
never angels?

280
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,253
People summon angels all the time.

281
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,005
They just don't want to interfere.

282
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,841
Now, demons, on the other hand,

283
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,260
they're just dying to come here.

284
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,595
It's most tempting to do that
when we're kind of weak,

285
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,097
out of sorts.

286
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,975
Some people meditate for years
to achieve the proper mind set,

287
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,821
but we use tricks...

288
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,074
to get us there faster.

289
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,901
- MICHAEL: Uh, grape juice?
- With LSD.

290
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,903
How much LSD?

291
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,031
If you're nervous about this part,

292
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,626
we should stop right now.

293
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,079
There are two prevalent
methods for summoning demons.

294
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,249
The first is by offering the
demon something up front.

295
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,586
A human life, continued servitude,

296
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,588
your own soul.

297
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,882
I don't recommend those paths

298
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,301
as once performed they're
very hard to undo.

299
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,553
The second method entails
creating the type

300
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,639
of frenetic atmosphere
demons are drawn to...

301
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,434
chaos, blood,

302
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,270
sex, violence.

303
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,064
I'll need some of your essence.

304
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,982
Uh, saliva?

305
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,406
Semen.

306
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,454
(CHUCKLES) You're kidding, right?

307
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,950
And I have to get it in this cup?

308
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,370
- Bathroom's right over there.
- Okay.

309
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,706
Ever hear of auto writing?
Scrying? Psychography?

310
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,376
It's how we're going
to pick your demon,

311
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,503
- the one we're going to summon.
- Okay.

312
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,132
Close your eyes.

313
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,769
Now, clear your mind.

314
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,980
Open yourself up to the beyond.

315
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,893
Allow their energy
to flow through you,

316
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,613
to use you.

317
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,442
Let their energy flow.

318
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,287
Breathe.

319
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,541
Breathe.

320
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,827
I'm sorry, I'm not very susceptible
to this kind of stuff.

321
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,581
- I'm sorry.
- You did just fine.

322
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,840
Just a minute here.

323
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,467
So what are we looking
for here? What's this?

324
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,719
To see if the image that you drew

325
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,389
matches up with one of the demons.

326
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,641
And you think that I drew this?

327
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,601
Look.

328
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,229
Daungore.

329
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,440
"Commander of 37 legions.

330

Seeker of the defenseless,

00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,902
the nonbeliever.

332
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,447
Known also as the Great Mocker,

338
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,669
It's Latin for

339
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,094
"torture until madness."

340
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,937
I feel pretty weird, man.

341
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,892
(LAUGHS) Okay, look at this, man.

342
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,603
This look safe to you?
This is fucked up.

343
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,573
This is fucked up.
Look at all this plastic.

344
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,568
They're gonna kill me in here.
That's what they're gonna do.

00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,778
Oh, my God.

346
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,156
I'm losing my mind.
This is a bad idea.

347
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,036
This is bad. Jordan,
check this out.

348
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,545
Dude, maybe we should get
the fuck out of here.

we gotten ourselves into?

So necromancy is considered
the blackest of the black arts.

390
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,073
Why is that?

391

Well...

392
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:07,622
I think it gets most of its bad rap

393
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,875
because of the method
employed in performing it.

394
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,920
You mean dealing with corpses,
graves, funeral rites.

395
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,172
Right, right. That kind
of creeps people out.

396
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,632
Sure.

397
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,968
But as a mortician,

398
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,312
it's all part of my day job.

399
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,229
And as far as the magic goes...

400
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,144
it's really no different

401
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,855
than what any of these
mediums are doing

402
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,483
except we just employ a
slightly different method

403
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,988
in raising the dead.

404
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,791

MORTICIAN: A freshly deceased body

406
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:54,210
works best because the
soul may still be lingering.

407
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,962
Then we can kind of confuse it.

408
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,132
You know, make it think
that it's still alive

409
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,177
and that all it needs to do is just
get back inside of its living body.

410
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,554
Okay.

411
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,515
This is a mild anesthetic

412
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,020
similar to Novocain.

413
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,692
- Okay. Doing all right?
- Yeah.

414
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,112
Okay, it'll start to numb
in just a couple minutes.

415
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,573
The more that we can
make you appear

416
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,327
like that body the
soul once inhabited,

417
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,297
the better our chances.

418
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,665
You feel that?

419
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,542
- No.
- Okay.

MORTICIAN: The astral corpse,

421
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,339
it wants to keep living.

422
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,883
Living is what it knows.

423
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,220
You know? And unless it's
already grown accustomed

424
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,598
to the afterlife,
it's what's normal.

425
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,820
And it's desperate
to cling on to that.

426
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,107
The Sonoran Desert toad

427
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,027
contains dimethyltryptamine,

428
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,655
or DMT,

429
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,877
the most powerful
psychedelic on the planet.

430
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,247
The human body produces DMT.

431
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,374
It's released when we die.

432
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,335
It helps us pass to the other side.

433
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,754
But taking it while
we're still living

434
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,424
simulates a near-death experience.

435
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,769
I'm going to need to let it dry.

436
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,681
Prepare it.

437
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,224
It's gonna take some time.

438
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,773
We need to wait until
it's dark anyhow.

439
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,941
This Novocain is wearing
off on my stomach,

440
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,945
so this is starting to
hurt like a bitch, man.

441

Oh, there he is.

442
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,576

all turned around in here.

444
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,455
did you kill these things?

The toads, their pain,

446
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,420
agony, it creates
this sort of energy

447
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,423
that draws in the spirits.

448
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,925
Assume the position.

449
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,552
On your back.

450
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,679
Right.

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,181
The smell of burning DMT

452
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,901
can be intensely nauseating.

453
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,735
Like burning plastic.

454
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,568
Now, as it takes effect,

455
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,486
the world will shatter

456
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,489
and your body will quickly follow.

457
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,992

you're starting to die,

458
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,661
like you don't know how
to breathe at all.

459
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,538
But it's okay.

460
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,665
You just need to let go

461

- and go with it.

536
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,582
now that I've noticed it, I'm...

537
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,084
I'm fixated on it.

538
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,460
Hey there.

539
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,588
We're at this reading
by Erica Bell.

540
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,007
She's a relatively
well-known medium.

541
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,968
And then afterwards we
get to interview her.

542
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,928
So come on, let's check it out.

00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,682
Okay, was there something
with her throat?

545
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,350
Her breathing?

546
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,269
She had esophageal cancer.

547
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,438
She wants you to know she's okay.

548
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,315
- (APPLAUSE)
- She's watching over you.

549
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,610
And you're... no, hang on.

550
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,196
No, wait a minute. Someone
else is butting in here.

551
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,822
Lots of spirits want to talk today.

552
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,699
This is good. Okay.

553
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,284
All right, somewhere over here.

554
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,579
Yes. Yes, this is a
very strong signal.

555
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,122

556

She really, really wants to talk.

Right, she passed recently.

558
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,004
Happened kind of quickly,
an accident maybe.

559
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,465
Okay, she has a message.

560
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,218
No, that can't be right.
She wants to...

561
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,553
Michael, listen to me.

What happened?
We're not really sure.

567
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,817
Erica was about to
tell us something

568
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,741
and then she went
into that seizure.

569
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,202
I mean, was she actually
channeling Sam?

570
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,038
Or was that just all
part of her show?

571
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,831
And then the seizure

572
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,334
was just like a strange
coincidence or something.

573
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,752

it after dinner, all right?

- Thanks. Oh, fuck!
- Jeez.

me something like that?

that I could shake
this noise in my head,

Overtone? What does that mean?

613
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,143
It's when a singer
manipulates their voice

614

to have multiple pitches
at the same time.

615

I did it accidentally.
