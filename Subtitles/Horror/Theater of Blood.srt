00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,627
That damned editor's cut the
best part of my review.

2
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,672
So I noticed, dear. You ought
to have a chat with him.

- (PHONE RINGS)
- Oh.

4
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,298
My most provocative comment, too,

5
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,722
where I said the leading lady
attacked her role with both hands

6
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,640
and strangled it to death.

8
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,439
Yes, I'm the chairman of the Bermondsey
Housing and Redevelopment Committee.

9
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,026
Really, Constable, you
don't need me for that.

10
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,075
Oh. Well, if you feel that I'm the
only one who can handle it, yes.

11
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,792
Yes, I'll be there within the hour.

Apparently squatters have settled in the
ruin of that tenement we're tearing down.

13
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,500
- I have to throw them out.
- Must it be you?

14
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,754
- Yes, they need someone with authority.
- But you have the Critics Circle meeting.

15
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:01,634
- I can handle this in a very few moments.
- Please don't go. Let someone else do it.

16
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,729
- Why? What's worrying you?
- I had such a bad dream last night.

17
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,817
We were at the zoo. There was a storm
and lightning broke open the lions' cages.

18
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,437
- Well?
- We ran from the animals, but you fell.

19
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,564
Before I could help,
they tore you to pieces.

20
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,034
I'm not going anywhere near
the zoo today, my dear.

21
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,576
You might ring Perry Devlin and tell him
I'll be a bit late for the Critics meeting.

22
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,541
George, I read your
horoscope this morning.

23
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,708
It said March is a difficult month.
Avoid unexpected engagements.

24
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,627
The ides of March, eh?

25
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,797
Well, we must not put our faith in dreams
and horoscopes, must we, my love?

26
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,966
I'll call you later.

Only too happy to help the police.

31
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:42,109
They're a stubborn lot, sir. I'm afraid
you're going to have to be very firm.

00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,656
Yes, well, let's get
on with it, then.

He was my friend,

But Brutus says he was ambitious,

00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,737
and Brutus is an honourable man.

68
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,035
He hath brought many
captives home to Rome,

69
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,456

general coffers fill.

to leave shortly.

be kept waiting.

- That's uncalled-for, Merridew.
- Would you look after Georgie?

- She gets so nervous in committee.
- Take that revolting animal away.

- I say wait. It's only courtesy.

- I say get on with it.

And let your gorgeous secretary send him
the minutes of our profound deliberations.

that glorious secretary isn't with us.

- George Maxwell is dead.

he's been cut to ribbons.

I don't know. They just say
he's been hacked to pieces.

All right, Sergeant.

115
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,308
I haven't seen a man cut like that in
all my 20 years in the police force.

116
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,276
Nor me. And that's only his head!

117
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,822
Any idea who did this?

118
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,318
We know by the different weapons
used there were at least six,

119
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,036
but we've yet to
discover who they were.

120
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,199
Found something
interesting, Mr Devlin?

121
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,371
No, only this old poster.

122
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,789
Oh, yes. I saw him once.

123
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,883
He's a very, um...
very vigorous actor.

124
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,212
That's a good description.

125
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,055
- I take it you didn't like him.
- No, I didn't.

126
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,471
I could never write
anything good about him.

127
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:32,598
Funny, but you begin to resent an actor if
you always have to give him bad notices.

128
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:48,197
Edward Lionheart alive! Incredible.
Quite incredible. I can hardly believe it.

129
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,450
Very much alive, sir. Very
anxious to see you, sir.

130
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,044
Oh, the old Burbage Theatre.
I thought it had been burnt down.

131
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,256
There was a fire, sir. Mr
Lionheart's fixed the place up.

132
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:02,002
- He's preparing for a comeback.
- Oh, most interesting.

144
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,382
But I can't see him.

00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,019

148
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,480

151
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:06,505
Oh, my dear sir, what a pleasure
to see you well and alive.

152
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:12,053
Yes, it was a remarkable
resurrection, as you shall hear.

153
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:16,303
What a great honour you should choose
me to tell your stories to the world.

154
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:20,557
Well, I've always admired
you as a critic, Snipe.

155
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,777
Your clever turn of phrase, your
use of analogy and metaphor.

156
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,398
One always felt that you were
striving to be complimentary.

157
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,150
- Most generous...
- But not always complimentary.

158
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,154
Critics make errors.
After all, we're all human.

159

incapable of sharing.

160

You must admit I was most enthusiastic
about your performance as Achilles.

161
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:47,251
Oh, yes. Yes, now that you mention it,
I vaguely recall you wrote some review.

162
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,547

166
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:02,857
- Well, something of that sort.
- A splendid review, my dear Snipe.

167
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,694
- What else did you say?
- More, in the same vein.

168
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,731

00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,958
"That actor's oft-expressed desire
for solitude is well known.

172
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:25,877
"He must derive much satisfaction in
knowing that he is absolutely alone

173
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:30,376
"in his opinion of this
lamentable production."

174
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,514
- Did I write that?
- Your name is Hector Snipe?

175
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:40,512
I can only say that you were one actor
who could always accept criticism.

176
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,398
Criticism is one
thing, my dear Snipe.

177
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,735
Then there is the little matter of
the Critics Award Presentation.

178
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,400
I can't accept blame for that.

179
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:55,402
Devlin was president of the Circle, and
you know how persuasive he can be.

180
00:18:55,426 --> 00:19:00,703
Devlin? Do you think you can
hide your guilt behind his?

181
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,700
Maxwell thought so, too.

182
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:09,833
It's all right, sir. No need to worry,
sir. You're among friends here, sir.

183
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:14,804
Oh, thank you, my dear man. I was
getting a little bit nervous.

184
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,548
We were rehearsing
Troilus and Cressida.

185
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,268
The scene where Hector,
believing he was among friends,

186
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,854
was brutally murdered by
them without warning,

187
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:29,228
and his body dragged from the
battlefield tied to a horse's tail.

188
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:34,073
Lionheart, I came here for an interview,
not for a lecture on Shakespeare.

189
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,696
Now, tell us this remarkable
story of your resurrection.

190
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:43,416
It's a grave tale, Snipe,
and difficult to write,

191
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,627
but I am sure you can
rise to the occasion.

192
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,798
Stand back! Get out of the way!

193
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:09,484
The dragon wing of night
o'erspreads the earth.

194
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,355
My half-supp'd spear, that
frankly would have fed,

195
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:17,109

196
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,865

In the midst of life,
we are in death.

199
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,208
We therefore commit his
body to the ground.

resurrection to eternal life

Man that is born of a woman hath but a
short time to live and is full of misery.

204
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,149

down like a flower.

205
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,776

never continueth in one stay.

206

Almighty God, Father of all
mercies and giver of all comfort,

207
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,283
deal graciously, we pray
thee, with those who mourn,

208
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:11,879
that casting every care on thee, they
may know the consolation of thy love,

209
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,466
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

210
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,086
- Amen.
- Who's that girl?

211
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,884
- Sh!
- I'm sure I know her from somewhere.

212
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,053
Do be quiet, Perry.

213
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,096

kept the world in awe,

should patch a wall to
expel the winter's flaw.

Yeah. Hector Snipe.

- A critic?
- Yeah.

228

But he's supposed to be
one of the mourners.

00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:27,053
George Maxwell, Hector Snipe...
both dead, both critics. Now, why?

230

Who hates you enough to want
to kill two of your circle?

231
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,053
Critics are likely to
make enemies, Inspector.

232
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,431
You might call it an
occupational hazard.

233
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:40,107
But, darling boy, they won't start killing
people for writing bad notices, will they?

234
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:46,109
Well, why not? A play fails, directors,
writers, actors, careers ruined.

235
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,368
Plenty of motivation
there, I should think.

236

Are you saying some lunatic in the
theatre might be trying to kill us all?

237
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:57,086
It's a distinct possibility. I'd like
you all to give it some thought.

in touch with me... at once.

I'm going to be ill.

- What?

Hello, Edwina.
I thought it was you.

00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,649
Well, the brilliant
Peregrine Devlin.

245
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,019
Wielder of the brutal aphorism.

246
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,192
Master of the killing phrase.

247
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,407
My father's murderer.

248
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:13,454
- That's a bit melodramatic, isn't it?
- Oh, forgive me. I forgot.

that drove him to take his own life.

- I understand the greatest ever actor

Never. Not one good review.

253
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:31,051
In his entire career your father refused
to appear in anything but Shakespeare.

254

A truly great actor illuminates
the present as well as the past.

255

I attacked him in order to goad
him into the 20th century.

What do you want, Devlin?

257
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,270

posthumous attack on him?

00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,189
No.

00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,715
But how did you know this?
I haven't seen anything in the papers.

341
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,630
Sprouty decapitated.

342
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,299
I was supposed to take him to
our rehearsal this morning,

343
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,422
but when I called at his house...

344
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,891
There, there, my child.

345
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,021
- Can I get you a brandy?
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

346
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,897
It's just that Mr Sprout was
such a good friend to our group.

347
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,610
He took such an interest in me.

348
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,357
I'm not surprised, my dear.

349
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,075
Old Sprouty always had
an eye for talent.

350
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:43,204
- You are an actress?
- Yes, but only an amateur.

351
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,328
Mr Sprout was kind enough to
say he'd watch us rehearse

352
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:50,003
and give us the benefit of
his professional opinion.

353
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:55,801
Can you imagine how brave it was of poor
Mrs Sprout, even in her terrible distress,

354
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,891
to suggest that I come
to you, his best friend,

355
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,976
and ask you to substitute?

356
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:07,603
- Right now, you mean?
- Oh, but could you?

357
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,397
Could you?

358
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,023
Well, I'd do anything
for old Sprouty.

359
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:18,994
Perhaps after rehearsal, we could
have a little supper together?

360
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,781
And then you could tell
me what you think of me.

361
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,375
About your performance, you mean?

362
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,208
Yes. Shall we go?

Oh, God, Merridew. Don't be so
disgusting. I need another drink.

What about our families?
What about my wretched wife?

- We're the targets. Not our families.
- Yes, you're right, Mr Devlin.

- What is it, Sergeant?
- Mr Dickman, sir.

372
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,182
His office said he was at lunch,

373
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:35,278
so I sent a car to the restaurant right
away, but I'm afraid we missed him.

374
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,365
- Missed him?
- Only just.

- Come on.

It's living theatre with

you need my help.

in a bondsman's key,

whispering humbleness say this:

"Fair sir, you spit on me
on Wednesday last,

"another time you call'd me dog..."

00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,681
Ah, we're doing The
Merchant of Venice.

00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,970
And you are Antonio.

393

Me Antonio? I'm no actor.
I'm just a critic.

394

You'll find we've made several
slight alterations in the text

395

and one rather large cut.

before thou hadst a cause,

397

to have the due and
forfeit of my bond.

- It's your cue.
- Oh.

Make no more offers,
use no further means,

plain conveniency,

and this man his will.

No, no, no, with more feeling.

Let me have judgment
and this man his will!

look upon the bond.

may claim a pound of flesh

the merchant's heart.

There is no power in the
tongue of man to alter me.

Most heartily I do beseech the
court to give the judgment.

Why then, thus it is:

You must prepare your
bosom for his knife.

and upright judge.

you anything to say?

shall lose your friend,

he pays your debt.

used, I believe... inadequate.

the Best Actor Award was going to him.

to his feet to accept it.

withheld it from me.

You deliberately humiliated me before
the press, my public and my peers.

determined denial of my genius.

We've denied you nothing.

acknowledged that I was the master

00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,110
with your overweening malice,

508
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:23,358
give the award to a
twitching, mumbling boy

509
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:28,955
who can barely grunt his way through
an incomprehensible performance.

510
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,573
No, no.

511
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:32,450
It is mine!

512
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:36,875
Father.

513
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,424
Father, please come away.

514
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,174
You mustn't do this.

515
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,599
You're only helping
them to hurt you more.

516
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,273
Edwina...

517
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,192
Oh, my God!

518
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:06,071
What have I done?

519
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,791
Father.

520
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,928
My God, we've got
the entire family!

521
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,596
Look at him. Really!

522
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:36,598
To be, or not to be:

523
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,941
that is the question.

524
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:43,187
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

525
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:47,738
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

526
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:53,163
or to take arms against
a sea of troubles,

527
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,999
and by opposing end them?

528
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,705
To die, to sleep. No more.

529
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:04,379
And, by a sleep to say
we end the heartache

530
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,131
and the thousand natural
shocks that flesh is heir to.

531
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,260
'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wish'd.

532
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,105
To die.

533
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,983
To sleep.

534
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,602
To sleep.

535
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,651
Perchance to dream.

536
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,451
Ay, there's the rub.

537
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:35,449
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come

538
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:40,044
when we have shuffled
off this mortal coil,

539
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,130
must give us pause.

540
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:49,344
Butchers!

541
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:09,282
There's the respect that
makes calamity of...

542
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,489
so long life!

543
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:29,503
It's all our faults. We took advantage
of the occasion to humiliate him.

544
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:34,303
Yes, well, that's very moving, Mr Devlin...
thank you, miss... but just one question:

545
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,267
how does a dead man
commit three murders?

546
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,682
Obviously he's not dead, Inspector.

547
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:44,434
All right. Accepting your theory...
Sergeant, what's the next play on the list?

548
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,777
The Merchant of Venice.

549
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:50,524
- What's the murder in that, then?
- There is no murder in that.

550
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:54,949
Excuse me, Inspector. This
just arrived for Mr Devlin.

551
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,876
"I'm sorry to have missed the meeting,
but my heart is with you. Dickman."

552
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,296
Open that.

553
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,843
Ugh!

554
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:15,798
Horrible!

555
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,597
You said there was no murder
in The Merchant of Venice.

556
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:22,563
The pound of flesh
Antonio owed to Shylock.

557
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,692
It's Lionheart all right.

558
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:30,404
Only he would have the temerity
to rewrite Shakespeare.

559
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,160
Ah, splendid. Thank
you so much, Officer.

560
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,286
Excuse me, sir. How long
will this wine tasting take?

561
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,005
Oh, well, I'd say within the hour.

562
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:51,797
- I'll be waiting for you right here, sir.
- Thank you so much, Officer.

563
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,554
- May I see your invitation?
- Oh, yes.

564
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:03,930
Ah, yes, Mr Larding. We're honoured.
This way, please.

565
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:08,355
- Thank you.
- I suggest you try a sip of wine.

566
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:24,918
LIONHEART: Now is the
winter of our discontent.

567
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:30,665
Made glorious summer
by this sun of York.

568
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:36,467
And all the clouds that
lour'd upon our house

569
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:40,842
in the deep bosom of
the ocean buried.

570
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:48,479
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths.

571
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:54,151
Our bruised arms hung
up for monuments.

572
00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:03,240
Our stern alarums changed
to merry meetings.

573
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:10,588
He capers nimbly in
a lady's chamber

574
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,757
to the lascivious
pleasing of a lute.

575
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,897
Well, now, Larding.

576
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:39,450
HIPPY: Ladies and gentlemen,
if you will follow me now.

577
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,035
This way to the wine cellar.

578
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,498
How do you do? Hello.

579
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:57,172
So my performance of Richard the Third
cast such a spell upon the audience

580
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,091
that it put this reviewer into a

581
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:05,184
"deep sleep from which he awoke much
refreshed and relieved by the knowledge

582
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,148
"that he had been spared the ordeal of
attending to the ageing matinee idol's

583
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,984
"ranting and posturing."

584
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,773
Well, we shall see if
we cannot stir you

585
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,777
to more rapt attention
with today's performance.

586
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,744
(DOOR OPENS)

587
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:28,662
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul:

588
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,285
here Clarence comes.

589
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:30,640
As I am subtle, false
and treacherous,

590
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:35,938
this day should Clarence
be closely mew'd up.

591
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,903
But soft.

592
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,523
Here come my executioners.

593
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:45,868
I believe you have a passion
for our Chateau Margaux '59.

594
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,486
Oh, rather!

595
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:51,741
Mm! Oh, yes. That's absolutely
my favourite Médoc.

596
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,617
Oh, rather.

597
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:57,087
Mm. Oh, yes, it's a fine,
robust conditioned wine, yes.

598
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,548
Sirs!

599
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:02,509
Be sudden in the execution.

600
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:06,972
Withal obdurate, do not hear him
plead, for Larding is well-spoken,

601
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:12,141
and perhaps may move your
hearts to pity if you mark him.

602
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,763
Hello, hello? What's all this, eh?

603
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,482
This is supposed to
be wine tasting.

604
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,146
(ALL LAUGH DRUNKENLY)

605
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,040
(GASPS) Lionheart.

606
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,961
- Impossible!
- No!

607
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:49,841
No, Larding. Not impossible.

608
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,933
It is I... Lionheart.

609
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,771
You disgusting winebibber.

610
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,936
So this reviewer slept
through my Richard, did he?

611
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:03,733
Because you had guzzled so much wine
beforehand you slept like a drunken hog

612
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,152
through one of my
finest performances!

613
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,652
But you will recall that
the Duke of Clarence,

614
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,905
and I would like you to try
out for that part, Larding,

615
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,374
was drowned in a butt of wine.

616
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,127
Look behind you, my lord.

617
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,216
Oh, no, no, please,
please. Oh, please...

618
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,960
No, no! No, don't!
No, please don't!

619
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,962
Argh!

620
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,176
(GASPS AND SCREAMS)

621
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:42,313
Excellent, Larding. Excellent.
I shall make an actor of you yet.

622
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,061
Argh!

623
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:57,408
I thought you might enjoy
that Chambertin '64, Larding.

624
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,877
It's a vintage that
comes on very well.

625
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:06,251
And, uh, don't hesitate to complain
if it isn't sufficiently chambré.

626
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,516
I wonder if he'll travel well.

627
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:33,160
Good. That seems to work OK. Now,
don't move your head too much.

628
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,241
I'm busy, Devlin.

629
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,870
Edwina, four of my colleagues
have been murdered.

630
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:46,339
Their deaths relate directly to your
father's last repertory season.

631
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:50,461
If you were as imaginative in your
reviews, Devlin, you'd be a better critic.

632
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,548
Before another murder
is committed...

633
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:59,304
My father was incapable of harming
anyone, let alone killing four people.

634
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:02,306
Five, Miss Lionheart.
Better make that five.

635
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,267
Larding's just been found dead.

636
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,110
He was drowned.

637
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:11,197
It seems his lungs were
filled with Chambertin 1964.

638
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,737
Oh, my God. Richard the Third.

639
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:16,203
Clarence drowned in
a butt of malmsey.

640
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:22,001
Miss Lionheart, will you accompany us to
the police station to make a statement?

641
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,164
Sergeant.

642
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,259
It's not her, Inspector.
It's her father.

643
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:35,973
Look, when two people have the same
motives for murder and one is still alive,

644
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,966
who would you arrest?

645
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:42,141
Just go about your normal life
and leave the rest to us.

646
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,442
Hello, there. Where is everybody?

647
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:37,238
MAN WITH GERMAN ACCENT: De Toqueville
had a death in the family.

648
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,077
Oh.

649
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,205
Well, since you have
no worthy opponent,

650
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:49,296
perhaps you would be good enough to
have a bout or two with me, huh?

651
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,210
I'd be delighted.

652
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,925
I fence twice a week, but
I've never seen you before.

653
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:58,673
No, this is my first visit.
I'm afraid I'm not very good.

654
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:03,519
No, I have been very ill.
I had a serious accident.

655
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:06,388
- I broke a few limbs.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

656
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,562
No. Everything is all right now.

657
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,105
(CHUCKLES) Ja.

658
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,354
I'm splendid.

659
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,616
En? garde!

660
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,194
Just a minute. Your sabre.
There's no button.

661
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,702
Oh, so you noticed that, eh?

662
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,496
Well, then.

663
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,916
There. Now you do not
have one either.

664
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,255
You see!

665
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:35,467
- Lionheart!
- Alive and triumphant.

666
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,177
And you thought me slain.

667
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:54,357
Lionheart is immortal. He
can never be destroyed.

668
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,605
Never! Never!

669
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,873
Up! Up!

670
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:21,259
I thought you were alive, but how?
I mean, how did you survive?

671
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:26,601
There's no longer any reason why you
shouldn't be told what happened.

672
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,523
(SHOUTS)

673
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,407
(ALL SCREAM AND SHOUT EXCITEDLY)

674
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:03,316
LIONHEART: O, brave new world,

675
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:08,112
that had such lovely
creatures in it.

676
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,696
DEVLIN: I've nothing
against you, Lionheart.

677
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,281
Why don't you get away while

must be familiar with the duel scene.

the others, didn't you?

686

How many actors have you
destroyed, as you destroyed me?

687
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:52,989
How many talented lives have you
cut down with your glib attacks?

and toil of a theatrical production?

women in the noblest profession of all?

you talentless fools,

creative efforts of others

692

to create yourselves?

693

kill Larding and the others.

have to be punished.

listen to that demented rubbish of yours.

Argh!

702
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:55,301
You didn't have to go to such pains
to prove Lionheart was still alive.

hundreds of times. It was him.

706
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,861
Actually, Mr Devlin, we're convinced
you're right. It's Lionheart. He's our man.

707
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:13,277
Naturally, we had to
release his daughter.

708
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:16,698
I'd keep an eye on her, if I were you.
She's a devoted daughter.

01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:39,686
"of Miss Lillywhite as Lavinia
and Miss Mole as Tamora,

843
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:45,158
"one is irresistibly
reminded of a ham sandwich."

844
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,698
My reputation.

845
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,159
Hark, villain!

846
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:55,251
I will grind your bones to dust,

847
01:20:55,267 --> 01:21:00,248
And make two pasties
of your shameful head.

848
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:15,188
Now you know what he looks like, so
keep your wits about you and eyes open.

849
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:20,397
Well, Sergeant, we've got four police
cars in front of Devlin's home

850
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,690
and three here at Merridew's.

851
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:26,987
They'll be bringing him home by
armoured car from work in ten minutes.

852
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,906
That should discourage
our Mr Lionheart.

853
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:32,405
Yeah, what's the next
murder, Inspector?

854
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:35,032
Intended murder,
you mean, Sergeant.

855
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:37,205
It's Titus Andronicus.

856
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:41,502
Two chaps are mutilated and beheaded,
another stabbed and thrown in a pit,

857
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:46,469
and to cap it all some queen is made
to eat her children baked in a pie.

858
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:52,179
It's hardly a comedy, Sergeant.
Still, I think we'll be able to hand...

859
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,723
That's him! After him.

860
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,770
That's him! After him, all of you!

861
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,819
(SIRENS)

862
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,371
Move it!

863
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,091
Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh!

864
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:56,306
Where are my babies, eh?

865
01:23:56,323 --> 01:23:58,676
Daddy's home!

866
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:02,812
Ooh-ooh!

867
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:06,479
Where are my doggy-woggies?
My doggy-woggies?

868
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,977
Ooh.

869
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,069
Come to Daddy.

870
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:13,532
I know where you are. (CHUCKLES)

871
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:17,820
I know where you're hiding.

872
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,453
Meredith Merridew,

873
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:26,329
this is your dish!

874
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:27,796
(FANFARE)

875
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,458
Oh! Oh!

876
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:33,426
What a divine surprise.

877
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:37,632
I've often thought, "What if
I was on This is Your Dish?"

878
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:42,891
And now that I am, I can't
think of anything to say,

879
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:46,390
except this is a very great honour.

880
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:50,520
Merci. Please be seated, monsieur.

881
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:55,024
There. Now, we will
make you comfortable.

882
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:57,196
There we go.

883
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:01,367
- Which is the camera?
- That one right over there, monsieur.

884
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:08,962
For what we are about to receive, may
the Lord make us truly thankful.

885
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,547
Amen.

886
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:13,216
Ooh.

887
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,381
(SIREN)

888
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,100
Keep your eyes on the road!

889
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:27,272
What are you trying to
do, Sergeant? Kill us all?

890
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,575
Come on, Sergeant!

891
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:50,378
LIONHEART:
This is the best vintage, monsieur.

892
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,793
Soixante-six.

893
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:58,462
Oh!

894
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:01,682
Oh, I hope everything is to
monsieur's satisfaction.

895
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:04,597
- Simply delicious.
- Bon d'accord

896
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:07,688
I wonder where my
babies have got to.

897
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:11,684
My doggies, you know. I always
think of them as my babies.

898
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,812
Of course you do,
monsieur. And so do we.

899
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:17,359
That is part of your surprise.

900
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:20,109
I wish they were here
to share this with me.

901
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:24,204
Why, there they are,
both baked in that pie.

902
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,995
Whereof their mother
daintily hath fed,

903
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:33,043
eating the flesh which
she herself hath bred.

904
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,382
Oh. Mm.

905
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,593
(TUTS)

906
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:41,589
What was that? Where are my dogs?
Where are my babies?

907
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:46,014
Well, if Monsieur cannot do without his
dogs, then he shall have his dogs.

908
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,353
- Props!
- (ALL WHISTLE)

909
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:55,602
You see, monsieur, two dogs...

910
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,025
two pies.

911
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:01,400
We knew that Monsieur
would be hungry.

912
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:03,619
Oh... oh...

913
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:10,333
You do remember, monsieur,
how in Titus Andronicus,

914
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:14,125
the Queen Tamora was served her
own children baked in a pie.

915
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:18,752
Of course, in your case we've
used only the tenderest morsels.

916
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:22,091
Do have some more.

917
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:29,061
Now, will you ever again ruin the
reputation of an honest man?

918
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:31,475
- No.
- Ah-hah.

919
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:35,150
- Have you learnt your lesson?
- Yes.

920
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,816
Can I be certain you will
never again offend me?

921
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,028
Yes!

922
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:42,069
You're quite right, I can be sure.

923
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:46,449
Thou detestable maw,

924
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:50,996
gorg'd with the dearest
morsel of the earth,

925
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:54,746
thus I enforce thy
rotten jaws to open,

926
01:27:55,562 --> 01:28:00,133
and, in despite, I'll
cram thee with more food!

927
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:01,968
(MERRIDEW CHOKES)

928
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:23,482
Pity.

929
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:26,201
He didn't have the stomach for it.

930
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:31,929
This is Hamlet calling Fortinbras.
Hamlet calling Fortinbras.

931
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,929
- 'Can you hear me?'
- This is Fortinbras.

932
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,306
You're loud and clear, Hamlet.
Everything all right?

933
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:42,061
Yes. I've reached the rendezvous.
She should be here any moment.

934
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,938
Fine. Let's have a check
on the homing device.

935
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,781
Right.

936
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:49,655
(BEEPS)

937
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:58,039
Good. As long as that signal keeps
coming in, we can't lose you.

938
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,411
Come in, Horatio.

939
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:02,210
'Come in, Horatio.
Are you receiving me?'

940
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:15,557
Receiving you, Fortinbras.
Is my signal clear?

941
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,805
'We're tied to your tail, Horatio.'

942
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,952
She's just coming.
I'm signing off now.

943
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:44,126
- He's not far from here. Shall we go?
- Edwina, I have to be honest with you.

944
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:47,376
There's a homing device in the
car. The police will follow us.

945
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,845
- But you gave me your word!
- Look, the man's homicidal.

946
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,465
I'm not tackling him on my own.

947
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,218
Yeah, you're right. But
you'll have to let me drive.

948
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:59,937
- Why?
- If he sees you, he won't give himself up.

949
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:02,103
Yeah, all right.

950
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,229
Don't worry, I can handle him.

951
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:09,773
Ooh!

952
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:13,781
'Horatio to Fortinbras. He's
started up the engine now.'

953
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:15,245
Right.

954
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,836
(BEEPS)

955
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:48,194
'Horatio to Fortinbras. We are
stopping. They are getting out.'

956
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:50,860
- (WHISTLING)
- 'I hear a train whistle.

957
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:55,406
'Yes, I can definitely identify
it as a train. T-R-A...'

958
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:57,575
(CRASH)

959
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,111
Good day, Mr Devlin.

960
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:39,576
Welcome to the Critics
Circle Awards Presentation.

961
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:46,373
You will remember it, of course.

962
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:50,044
It was a memorable
occasion for all of us.

963
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:53,635
Today, however, we are
going to restage it

964
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:56,630
and you will again
present the awards.

965
01:32:57,822 --> 01:33:01,267
Nothing you can do will sway
me from my original judgment.

966
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:05,355
Your judgment was ill-considered
and irresponsible.

967
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:06,518
It was neither!

968
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:10,731
We gave the award to
William Woodstock

969
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:13,480
because your performances
lacked originality.

970
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:15,983
Lacked originality?

971
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:21,489
My Julius Caesar... cut down by a
drunken mob in an abandoned warehouse.

972
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:26,540
My Titus Andronicus... "This is
your dish, Meredith Merridew."

973
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:31,540
My Othello... one of the greatest
performances in the history of the theatre.

974
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:35,134
Nothing you can do or say
will alter my decision.

975
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,013
We shall see.

976
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:53,400
No! Not one drop, until
you tell us where he is.

977
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:56,648
Be fair, Inspector. Think what
he'd do to me if I told you.

978
01:33:56,673 --> 01:34:00,619
He'll do nothing! We'll put him away
where he'll never harm a soul again.

979
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:04,948
- D'you want a drink or don't you?
- Yes, please, Inspector.

980
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:08,998
- I'm just dying for a drop.
- First tell us where Lionheart is.

981
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:18,258
You will recall, Mr Devlin, that the last
play in my repertoire was King Lear.

982
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:23,179
And I'm sure you will remember
the fate that befell Gloucester.

983
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:29,682
He was blinded, Mr Devlin, to
improve his vision of events.

984
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:36,815
Perhaps a similar adjustment will
rectify your critical faculties.

985
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:45,576
Lionheart, think of your daughter.

986
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:49,452
Think of what you've done to her
with this insane vendetta of yours.

987
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:52,036
MY daughter?

988
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:56,757
What have I done to
you, my daughter?

989
01:34:56,774 --> 01:35:02,847
Good my lord, you have begot
me, bred me, lov'd me.

990
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:07,060
I return those duties
back as are right fit.

991
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:10,680
Obey you, love you,
most honour you.

992
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:14,309
Give him the award.

993
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:25,363
- Forgotten the words, Mr Devlin?
- I remember them, but I won't say them.

994
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,205
You will repeat after
me, Mr Devlin.

995
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:33,916
With this award we not only honour a
consistently brilliant interpretative artist,

996
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:39,965
but we also recognise his outstanding
contribution to the English theatre.

997
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:42,587
Therefore it is my
privilege to announce

998
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:45,386
the Best Actor of the
Year Award goes to...

999
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,634
- William Woodstock!
- (APPLAUSE, CHEERING)

1000
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:53,102
No! Present me the
award, Gloucester,

1001
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:57,398
or you will lose your eyes and have
to smell your way through the world.

1002
01:35:57,418 --> 01:36:02,399
As Lear said at his greatest moment:
Never, never, never, never, never!

1003
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:07,279
Never, never, never, so be it.

1004
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:11,203
- Edwina, you will give me the award.
- Yes, Father.

1005
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:15,420
It will be the last thing
that Mr Devlin will ever see.

1006
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:21,509
The Critics Circle is happy to present
this award for Best Actor of the Year

1007
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:24,800
- to Edward Lionheart.
- (APPLAUSE, CHEERING)

1008
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,583
(SIRENS)

1009
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:07,597
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
always a nostalgic moment

1010
01:37:07,613 --> 01:37:09,932
when we come to the
end of a season,

1011
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:14,179
especially one that has been
as successful as this one.

1012
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:18,149
Will you join me in the
toast to the Immortal Bard?

1013
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:20,018
William Shakespeare!

1014
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:22,396
ALL: William Shakespeare.

1015
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,693
Shakespeare!

1016
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,443
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

1017
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:31,237
Burn.

1018
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,249
Burn.

1019
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:39,003
Come, fire.

1020
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:43,792
Consume this petty world.

1021
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:47,545
And in its ashes...

1022
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,633
let my memory lie.

1023
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,325
Help him.

1024
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:11,570
Help your master!

1025
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:15,741
Help!

1026
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,753
This is your master's
glorious hour.

1027
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:35,844
Please. Please help.

1028
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:48,690
A plague upon you,
murderers, traitors all!

1029
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,081
O, my daughter.

1030
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:01,544
How does my royal lord?

1031
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:03,959
How fares your Majesty?

1032
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,959
You did me wrong to take
me out of the grave.

1033
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:11,880
Thou art a soul in bliss,

1034
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:14,803
but I am bound upon a wheel of fire

1035
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:20,226
that mine own tears do
scald like molten lead.

1036
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:21,893
We are not the first

1037
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:25,769
who, with best meaning,
have incurr'd the worst.

1038
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:30,523
For thee, oppressed king,

1039
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:32,821
am I cast down.

1040
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:40,116
Stay!

1041
01:39:40,141 --> 01:39:42,414
Stay awhile.

1042
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:52,049
Howl.

1043
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:56,012
Howl, howl, howl!

1044
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:59,932
O, you are men of stones!

1045
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:05,642
After him!

1046
01:40:19,722 --> 01:40:21,950
Look, he's heading for the roof!

1047
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:31,793
There he is!

1048
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:39,300
Fool. If he doesn't come
down, he'll be burnt alive.

1049
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:37,112
Had I your tongues and eyes,

1050
01:41:37,633 --> 01:41:41,328
I'd use them so that
heaven's vault should crack.

1051
01:41:41,971 --> 01:41:44,119
She's gone for ever!

1052
01:41:45,683 --> 01:41:51,210
I know when one is dead,
and when one lives.

1053
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:54,379
She's dead as earth.

1054
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,846
Aaargh!

1055
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:09,273
Were those lines from King Lear?

1056
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:13,645
Yes. Yes, it was a
fascinating performance.

1057
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:17,023
But, of course, he was
madly overacting as usual.

1058
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:21,904
But you must admit he did
know how to make an exit.
