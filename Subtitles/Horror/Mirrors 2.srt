1
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,921
MAX: it was my fault.
l was the one driving when it happened.

2
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,481
After the accident, l started seeing things,
things that couldn't be real.

3
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,921
But l'm not crazy.

4
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:16,222
{GLASS SHUTTERING}

5
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,761
l know.

6
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,281
Your father knows.

7
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:24,361
Anyone who knows you knows that.

8
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:31,041
Look, Max, l've seen you every day
for the past two months.

9
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,281
Maybe you're starting to let go
of your misplaced guilt.

10
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:40,161
Maybe you're ready to stop blaming
yourself for what happened.

11
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:44,521
But there's no one else to blame.

12
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,201
it’s gotten to the point
where l look in the mirror...

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,001
and l'm not even sure
what's real anymore.

14
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,321
Fancy mirror.

15
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,001
Later.

16
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,601
You're a lady-killer, Schow.

17
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:23,801
Lady-killer.

18
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,881
What's going' on?

19
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:05,481
Hey! What-

20
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:10,982
{SCREAMING}

21
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,681
No!

22
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:38,082
{SCREAMING LOUDLY}

23
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:05,083
{CONTINUE SCREAMING LOUDLY}

24
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:25,401
Yeah.

25
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,681
Max.

26
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:29,681
- Who's this?
- Are you still sleeping? What time is it?

27
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,481
- Dad? Is that you?
- Of course it's me.

28
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,401
Yeah. Is everything all right?

29
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,721
Yeah. Did l wake you up?
You don't sound good.

30
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,761
- l'm fine. l'must getting some sleep.
- Thank you.

31
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,201
Careful over there.

32
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,121
Just getting to the point where l can
sleep through the night again.

33
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,361
Good, good.
You gotta get your rest.

34
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:49,601
- Keller.
- Yeah?

35
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:52,601
- Five minutes.
- Okay, that's great.

36
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,121
That is the Mayflower
signature right there.

37
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:00,841
That glass has been through so much.

38
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:02,921
You can see the care
that went into making it.

39
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,921
Even the base came
from the original store.

40
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,281
So that gives us the- its spirit.

41
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,641
l think it's perfect.

42
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,761
Look, Max, for the last two months
the police have been all over us...

43
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,841
looking for that missing girl.

44
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:20,161
Max, we may not be able
to open on time.

45
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,041
Really? l didn't know that, Dad.

46
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,881
And then last week
our night security guard goes crazy.

47
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:27,321
He cuts himself up bad and he quits.

48
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:31,921
Max, l've got weeks of work to do
and mo weeks out from opening.

49
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,001
The last thing l need to be doing...

50
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:36,081
is looking for a new night watchman.

51
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,961
l'm just not sure l'm ready yet, Dad,
after all that's happened this year and-

52
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,721
Max. This is what you need.

53
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:45,281
And, honestly,
right now l need you, Max.

54
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,841
l know it'll help you
take your mind off things.

55
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,601
- Yeah.
- Look.

56
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:53,081
- l think it's goanna be good.
- All right, Dad. l'll do it.

57
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,241
Thanks for the opportunity.

58
00:09:56,361 --> 00:10:00,001
No, no, no, thank you, Max.
l tell you what.

59
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:03,561
Why don't you come in to work
a little early and find me...

60
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,641
so that we can say hello
before you clock in. Okay?

61
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,801
- Yeah. Sure. l'll come find you.
- All right.

62
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,761
- We'll see you in a little bit.
- Okay, Dad.

63
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,841
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

64
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,441
Shoot.

65
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:49,521
l got it.

66
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,041
Just trying to help.

67
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,201
That may or may not be the case...

68
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:08,441
but you should put that on your punch list,
then take care of that first thing tomorrow.

69
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,521
Would you do that?

70
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,881
Jenna, will you take care
of the accessories? That'll be great.

71
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,321
Ladies and gentlemen, the thing
l am most proud of in the entire store.

72
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:22,881
- This is my son Max.
- Hi.

73
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,641
- How are you, son?
- Good.

74
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,321
Yeah? Get some rest?

75
00:11:26,441 --> 00:11:28,241
- Yeah.
- Okay.

76
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:30,121
l wanna introduce you
to a few people.

77
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,681
This is Keller Landreaux.

78
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,521
He's goanna be our store manager
when we open in a few weeks.

79
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,801
Keller told us that we could buy
property down here in New Orleans...

80
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,721
for a song and a dime.

81
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:42,961
That's exactly what we did.
Smart man.

82
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:44,721
Glad to meet you, Max.

83
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,521
My pleasure.
Thanks for having me.

84
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,721
And this beautiful young lady
we have right here...

85
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:53,121
this is Jenna McCarty.

86
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:55,001
Jenna is the head buyer
for the store...

87
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:58,081
and she has promised to bring us
a little bit of that Fifth Avenue flair...

88
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,801
to Bourbon Street, yes?

89
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,121
Sure.
Nice to meet you, Max.

90
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:03,201
You too.

91
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:06,961
You know, Max,
Ladies love a man in uniform.

92
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:12,481
Yeah, Dad, l'm sure the polyester pants
really help seal the deal.

93
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:17,561
And last but not least
l'd like to introduce you to Ryan P-

94
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,321
- What was your last name?
- Parker.

95
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:22,641
l'm just kidding you. Ryan Parker,
our vice president in charge of operations.

96
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,601
- Good to meet you, Max.
- Likewise.

97
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:28,441
While you're out there on your rounds,
you see something that doesn't look right...

98
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,641
you got a problem
with plumbing or electric, fire...

99
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,361
you get a candy bar stuck
in the vending machine, you call Ryan.

100
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:37,841
That's after you call me.

101
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:43,041
Listen. l'm goanna let you go.
l know you got a job to do.

102
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,481
And we need to continue on our rounds.
Good luck out there.

103
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,161
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right.

104
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,081
Shall we?

105
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:08,082
{SCREAMING}

106
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,921
You all right?

107
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,201
Sorry. First night.

108
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:31,401
So, Max, you say you've been
having those visions again?

109
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,761
Yeah.

110
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,121
Were you taking drugs or had you been
drinking when you had this episode?

111
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:42,201
No. It was last night at my new job.

112
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:46,921
l saw a woman
in one of the mirrors at my work.

113
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,881
You saw a woman?

114
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:53,201
Yeah. She was looking back at me
from the other side.

115
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,641
Her reflection looked like a corpse.

116
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,921
She probably reminded you
of Kayla in some way.

117
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,521
Your mind's way of
processing the mental shock.

118
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,521
And the pills l prescribed?

119
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,601
Yeah, l took one.

120
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,841
- That's all?
- Yeah.

121
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:14,921
Good.

122
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:18,561
l wanted to take more,
but l decided not to.

123
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,321
Very good.

124
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:22,801
So should we put
the straitjacket on me now...

125
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,161
or should we wait until my time's up?

126
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,521
l'm not worried about you, Max.

127
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,401
- No?
- Not at all.

128
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,601
What you're telling me,
it's a good thing.

129
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:33,721
Yeah?

130
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:38,681
These representations of Kayla,
hallucinations or not...

131
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,561
are a sign that you're starting
to get your life back in order...

132
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,121
that maybe you're starting to let go of
your misplaced guilt about her death...

133
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,961
that you're ready to stop blaming yourself
for what happened.

134
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:54,561
What intrigues me...

135
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,881
is that now that you've stopped wallowing
in the drugs and the alcohol...

136
00:15:58,001 --> 00:16:00,041
now that you're sober...

137
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,961
your mind is ready to begin
processing the tragedy in earnest.

138
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,561
You wanna come see me again
next week...

139
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,441
get back to a regular
appointment type thing?

140
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,521
Sure.

141
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,201
Yeah.
l'll run the numbers tomorrow.

142
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:49,801
Okay. And then l placed the orders
for size 8 through 12.

143
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,121
- No. No!
- Why? But-

144
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:56,161
it’s like l told you earlier. l don't
want to order any of the larger sizes.

145
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,641
But l don't-
Why, Jenna?

146
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,721
Why?

147
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:02,081
Because this Mayflower has to convey
the message that it's a boutique.

148
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,681
And boutique
implies skin and bones.

149
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,921
Yeah, l'm really sure.
Right, right. Okay.

150
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,841
So, if we do the research...

151
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:12,521
and it shows that the demographic
is full of heifers...

152
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,401
then we'll order accordingly.

153
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,961
But listen to me- Until then, four is
the new eight. Do you understand me?

154
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,881
- Yeah, l got it.
- Thank you. Talk to you later.

155
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,241
Camera in the bathroom?

156
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,801
Henry, you dirty dog.

157
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:40,681
Just want to check in
on my new favourite employee.

158
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,521
l'm good. Just happy to be here,
Mr. Landreaux.

159
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,401
We're happy to have you, Max.

160
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,721
Your dad entrusted me with the opening
of the new Mayflower as my top priority.

161
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,961
You seem committed,
being here so late.

162
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,521
Yeah. l can't let anything
interfere with our grand opening.

163
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:00,081
Yeah. l should do my rounds.

164
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,521
Hey, Max,
will you do me a favour?

165
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:07,001
Call me Keller.
We're all family here at the Mayflower.

166
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,361
Okay.

167
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,761
Jenna?

168
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:24,201
What are you-

169
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,081
No!

170
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:01,001
Fuck.

171
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,201
Morning', rookie.

172
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,321
So, how did that last night go?

173
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,281
Everything all right?

174
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:57,041
Dr. Beaumont's office.

175
00:24:57,161 --> 00:25:00,681
This is Max Matheson. l need to see
Dr. Beaumont as soon as possible.

176
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,561
Okay, let me see what l have.

177
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,481
How do you think this happened?

178
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,521
l don't know.

179
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,281
Looks more like a-
just a terrible accident...

180
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:21,401
but maybe someone killed her.

181
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,121
Homicide by handmade guillotine?

182
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:27,601
That would impress even yours truly.

183
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:29,841
Yeah, me too, Pete.

184
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,321
Me too.

185
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,161
- Dr. Beaumont?
- Yes?

186
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,401
Do you really believe all that, your
explanation for what's happening to me?

187
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,241
Well, of course.
There's really no other explanation.

188
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,161
And the fact that it's
all related to the mirrors...

189
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,321
that that's how
l'm seeing these visions?

190
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:02,561
Reconnaissance.

191
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:04,041
What's that?

192
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:08,921
it’s a French term from Jacques Lacan's
mirror stage of psychoanalytic theory.

193
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,401
The ego is a product
of false reflections.

194
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,281
Reconnaissance-

195
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:17,721
when the subject is alienated
from his or her self.

196
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:21,521
in English?

197
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:24,121
Nobody sees anything in a mirror...

198
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:26,801
that isn't simply a part of them...

199
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:29,521
not even things
they think they're seeing.

200
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:33,321
Every culture has its own particular
myth set regarding mirrors.

201
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:35,361
in Korea, for example...

202
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:39,881
it's believed that a person's soul
can be trapped inside of a mirror...

203
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,841
as it leaves the body.

204
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:46,241
You've heard the old adage, a cracked
mirror brings seven years bad luck.

205
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,121
And even here
in the South's recent past...

206
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,801
it was not uncommon to cover
all of the mirrors in a house...

207
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,641
where the wake of a deceased person
was being held.

208
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,561
There's even a clinical diagnosis...

209
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:02,601
for an intense fear of mirrors
called spectrophobia.

210
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,681
Lots of psychic baggage
in them there mirrors.

211
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,281
So l guess
l'm doing pretty well, then?

212
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:10,761
in light of all you've been through...

213
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:13,761
combined with all the superstitions
we hold regarding mirrors...

214
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:17,361
l'd say you're doing
pretty good indeed.

215
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,521
How are you holding' up?

216
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,081
Fine.

217
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:19,041
Your father didn't tell you.

218
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,601
Tell me what?

219
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:24,801
Jenna McCarty,
the woman you met the other day...

220
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:27,161
she died last night.

221
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,321
They found her in her apartment.

222
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,281
How did she die?

223
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:35,681
The police said she fell through glass.

224
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,201
it ripped her head off.

225
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,241
it was a horrible accident.

226
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:43,681
Such a tragedy.

227
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,041
Are you all right?

228
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:53,201
Yeah. l'm... just surprised.

229
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:56,121
You sure?

230
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:57,601
Yeah.

231
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,001
- Will you call me if you need anything?
- Yeah.

232
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:03,801
Thanks.

233
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,881
l still can't believe it.

234
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,961
Hello?

235
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,241
Are you here? It's me.

236
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:02,641
Hello?

237
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,481
Oh, God.

238
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,361
l'm really starting to lose it again.

239
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:43,962
{SCREAMING}

240
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,361
''P.'' ''P.'' Parker.

241
00:33:57,062 --> 00:34:00,762
{SCREAMING}

242
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,121
Where's the number?

243
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:51,822
{PHONE RINGING}

244
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:52,961
God!

245
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,481
Oh, God!
{SCREAMING}

246
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,921
Hi. You've reached Ryan's
answering machine.

247
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,081
l'm unable to get up
and get the phone right now...

248
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,761
so leave me a message with your name
and your phone number...

249
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,201
- Come on, goddamn it.
- and l will get back to you shortly.

250
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:36,721
Take care.

251
00:36:05,022 --> 00:36:08,722
NO,NO!

252
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:32,023
{SCREAMING LOUDLY}

253
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,561
You ever seen a 10-56 like that?

254
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,321
l'm not sure.

255
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,441
One thing l know-

256
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,281
This is the second death of an employee
who worked at the Mayflower.

257
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:08,481
The third, if you count the girl
who went missing two months ago.

258
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:23,201
- Officer.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:25,801
The witnesses.
Where'd you put 'em?

260
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:30,521
Hey, Pic.

261
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,001
Check out the badge.

262
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,041
He's definitely a person of interest.

263
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,761
Hello?

264
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:02,801
Yeah, hi, Dad.

265
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:06,881
What time is it?

266
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:09,041
l don't know. It's late.

267
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,281
What's going on, Max?

268
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:16,801
l'm just- l'm calling
to let you know that l'm-

269
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,721
l'm goanna be quitting my job.

270
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,961
Are you all right?

271
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,161
No, not really.

272
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:28,241
l can't keep working there.

273
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:31,801
it’s too much.

274
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:34,001
Too much?

275
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,241
Yeah.
l think l'm seeing things again.

276
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:39,201
l'm really sorry.

277
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:41,121
l don't care about the job.
Just-

278
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,601
- l need to know that you're okay.
- Yeah.

279
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,401
l'm okay.

280
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,361
Stop by tomorrow and drop off
your ID badge and all that, you know.

281
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:01,441
Yeah, l will.
Thank you for understanding, Dad.

282
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,201
Max, l'm your father...

283
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:06,041
and l do support you.

284
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,361
You know that.

285
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:09,121
Yeah, l do.

286
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,721
Okay.

287
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:12,481
Get some rest.

288
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,681
Okay.

289
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:42,561
What's wrong with you?

290
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,321
Dad!

291
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:39,601
Dad!

292
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:43,361
Max, what are you doing here?

293
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,481
l know what l need to do.

294
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:49,641
l came by-

295
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,961
- l changed my mind.
- Good for you.

296
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,241
l wanna stay at the Mayflower.

297
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,921
Come here.
Give me one.

298
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:02,081
Thank you.

299
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,881
it’s goanna be okay.

300
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,321
Yeah, l know.

301
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:10,001
We don't know why things happen
the way that they do...

302
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,441
but they have a tendency
to work themselves out.

303
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,761
Everything happens for a reason, Max.

304
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,601
Yeah. Right.

305
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,721
Are you hungry?

306
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,761
Want a slice?

307
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,801
l'm good.

308
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:41,441
- Can you hold up a sec?
- Just need a minute.

309
00:42:42,361 --> 00:42:44,201
May l help you?

310
00:42:46,361 --> 00:42:48,481
Detective Huston, Homicide.

311
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,121
Detective Piccalilli.
What he said.

312
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,481
Homicide?

313
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,561
We just come by to ask you
a few questions...

314
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,641
about some fellow employees
at the Mayflower...

315
00:42:57,761 --> 00:43:01,001
see if you might know anything about 'em
that might be of interest to us.

316
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,641
We went by your house.

317
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:04,201
You weren't there.

318
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,841
Okay. And?

319
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:10,721
And why don't you tell us.

320
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:13,001
Tell you what?

321
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,561
You heard about one
Miss Jenna McCarty, correct?

322
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:19,281
Yes.

323
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:21,321
And you were also at the home...

324
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,881
of Mr. Ryan Parker earlier tonight,
weren't you?

325
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:29,441
Yeah. But-

326
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,161
Then certainly you must have
gathered that he was dead, right?

327
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:33,401
Right.

328
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,201
Brutally murdered, as a matter of fact.

329
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,041
Hence, homicide.

330
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:40,841
Plural, actually, Pic.

331
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:43,721
Homicides, with an S.

332
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:45,401
You're right, man.

333
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,721
There've been two homicides...

334
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:50,161
involving employees
of the Mayflower this week.

335
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:52,241
Since you were
at the scene of the crime tonight-

336
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:53,761
And in charge of security-

337
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:58,001
it stands to reason that you might have
an opinion or two about these matters.

338
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,601
Am l a suspect?

339
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,921
No.

340
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,201
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

341
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:14,561
Not officially.

342
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,441
What, not officially?

343
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,001
At this point the only thing
you're suspected of...

344
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,281
is being a lousy security guard.

345
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:30,601
So, why were you out front
of the deceased's home earlier tonight?

346
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,041
Kind of a creepy coincidence,
don't you think?

347
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,921
No.

348
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,041
l don't think
it was a creepy coincidence.

349
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,761
Not at all.

350
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:46,481
And l might be a lousy security guard,
but it seems to me that the two of you are...

351
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,681
not too much better
at the detective stuff.

352
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:52,961
lf you'd have done your homework,
you would've seen that...

353
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,401
Mr. Parker is
the vice president of operations...

354
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,601
here at this particular branch
of the Mayflower Department Store.

355
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,281
And per protocol,
if anything goes wrong, it is my duty...

356
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:05,121
to contact Mr. Parker immediately.

357
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,081
Why not just call him?

358
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,081
As soon as you stop badgering me
and you get back to your work...

359
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,401
you'll be happy to see that the phone
records indicate that l did, in fact...

360
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,801
try to call Mr. Parker.

361
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,281
Probably, l might add, during the time at
which Mr. Parker was being, as you say...

362
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:22,321
brutally murdered.

363
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,841
Might be kind of hard for me
to have been the one killing him too.

364
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:32,241
So you ran over
to the deceased's home...

365
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:35,561
to let him know you were
having a problem with-

366
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,641
With the mirrors.

367
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,521
So unless there are any other questions,
l'd really like to get back to my work.

368
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,081
- No more questions.
- For now.

369
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,241
- We just wanted to stop by.
- Say hi.

370
00:45:53,361 --> 00:45:56,161
And let you know that
we got our eye out on you.

371
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,361
l feel so much safer knowing that.

372
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:04,561
Thank you very much, Detectives.

373
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,121
l don't understand.

374
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,041
Who are you?

375
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,161
What do you want?

376
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,401
She worked here.

377
00:49:48,841 --> 00:49:52,521
- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Elizabeth Reigns?

378
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,641
Hi. Elizabeth.

379
00:50:04,441 --> 00:50:06,561
Hi. l'm Max.

380
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,001
Hi.

381
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,041
You wanna talk about my sister?
You said you might have some information.

382
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,721
Yeah.

383
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,561
l think maybe l've seen her recently.

384
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,921
Where?

385
00:50:26,001 --> 00:50:28,161
At the Mayflower.

386
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:30,401
Where at the Mayflower?

387
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:34,721
in the mirrors.

388
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:40,081
What- In the mirrors?
What do you mean, in the mirrors?

389
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,321
Yeah, l know it sounds crazy...

390
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:46,081
but l see her reflection
in the mirrors.

391
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,801
And l-
Then l turn around and she's gone.

392
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:53,081
She's not there anymore.

393
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,081
l don't know
who put you up to this.

394
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,681
My sister, my little sister Eleanor has
been missing for almost two months now.

395
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:01,961
And you just turn this
into some kind of joke.

396
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:06,161
No, it's not a joke.

397
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,121
Listen to me.

398
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,201
- Listen, l'm serious.
- Don't touch me!

399
00:51:12,881 --> 00:51:15,121
Just don't touch me.

400
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,041
l know what l said, it sounds crazy.

401
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:21,761
it’s the truth.

402
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,561
So this started happening the first night
that you were working there?

403
00:51:29,321 --> 00:51:30,841
How can that be?

404
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:32,921
How is it that out of everyone
that works there...

405
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,561
you're the only one
that can see my sister?

406
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:40,721
A year ago,
l was driving with my fiancée.

407
00:52:01,281 --> 00:52:02,321
What?

408
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,521
Nothing'.

409
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:08,761
Okay.

410
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:16,401
Can you reach into the backpack,
grab my phone for me?

411
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,161
- Yeah.
- l need to call my dad.

412
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:21,881
Okay, hang on. Drive safe.

413
00:52:22,001 --> 00:52:24,681
- Okay, Max?
- Yeah. l got it.

414
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:26,561
- Please. Thank you.
- l can see.

415
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,281
Perfectly?

416
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:31,361
- Come on, l'm a great driver.
- Yeah.

417
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,441
Okay.

418
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,001
Where did you say it was?

419
00:52:36,881 --> 00:52:38,041
in the front there.

420
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,641
Front. Front.

421
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:45,641
- Are you sure?
- Honey, it's right there.

422
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:56,401
Any luck?

423
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,081
Oh, my God.

424
00:53:01,001 --> 00:53:04,121
Max Matheson,
is this what l think it is?

425
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,201
- Well, what do you think it is?
- l don't know.

426
00:53:36,921 --> 00:53:38,921
A drunk driver.

427
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,801
He hit you?

428
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:42,881
l swerved to avoid him.

429
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:45,961
l wrapped my car
around a telephone fall.

430
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,441
Technically, it was my fault.

431
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,081
And your fiancée, she-

432
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:55,281
she died in the accident?

433
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,001
We both did.

434
00:55:50,441 --> 00:55:51,801
Start an IV.

435
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,121
Stay still, sir.

436
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,761
They brought you back.

437
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:11,841
Maybe l brought back
something with me...

438
00:56:11,961 --> 00:56:16,121
some ability to see
the other side or something.

439
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:23,601
Afterward, l just got pretty
screwed up for a while-

440
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,281
drugs, alcohol...

441
00:56:25,401 --> 00:56:27,361
whatever l could put into me.

442
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,121
Like l was trying to get
closer to her or something.

443
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,721
- Wasn't your fault.
- l was the one driving.

444
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:38,121
You were trying to swerve to get out
of the way. You were trying to save her.

445
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:42,001
Yeah, but l couldn't.

446
00:56:43,961 --> 00:56:46,121
l couldn't save her.

447
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,761
You wanted to see her again.

448
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:52,001
Yeah. More than you could ever know.

449
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:00,881
How long's your sister been missing?

450
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,681
About two months.

451
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:07,841
And you still think she's-

452
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:11,201
Dead?

453
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,521
Of course, the cops say that young women
up and leave all the time to start new lives.

454
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,281
But Eleanor and l...

455
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:29,881
we weren't just sisters, we were
best friends, we were soul mates.

456
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:31,921
And the night that she...

457
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,481
disappeared...

458
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,121
l woke up from a deep sleep,
screaming for no reason.

459
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,041
My heart was beating so fast,
l thought it was goanna explode.

460
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,561
l knew right then and there.

461
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,961
What was your sister doing
the day she disappeared?

462
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,841
Working at the Mayflower.

463
00:57:55,961 --> 00:58:01,001
There was some sort of party that night
and she was- she'd just been hired on.

464
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,081
They were having
a groundbreaking celebration.

465
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,601
l gotta get to work.

466
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,321
Yeah, l gotta get some sleep.
l gotta work again tonight.

467
00:58:21,441 --> 00:58:24,081
Call me if anything else comes up.

468
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,841
Absolutely.

469
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,041
Thank you, Max.

470
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,641
l haven't done anything.
Not yet, anyway.

471
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,121
But you're trying.

472
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,121
That's more than anyone else
has been willing to do around here.

473
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,201
Eleanor.

474
00:59:26,921 --> 00:59:29,081
l'm tying my best.

475
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,481
l'm tying my best. Really.

476
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:41,041
Please. Stop doing this.

477
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,721
Wait. What are you doing?

478
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:53,921
Please, don't- don't do this.

479
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,161
Please.

480
00:59:56,281 --> 00:59:57,641
No.

481
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:02,281
Tell me what l need to do.
Please, tell me. Just-

482
01:00:02,401 --> 01:00:04,561
What is it? What?

483
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,481
Hello.

484
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,561
What night did she disappear?

485
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,441
it was a Wednesday night.

486
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,641
What was the specific date?

487
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:44,001
How come?

488
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,441
Well, it's a long shot,
but l thought maybe...

489
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,681
if something happened to Eleanor while
she was working here at the Mayflower...

490
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:53,001
maybe the security cameras
caught something.

491
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:57,161
it was Wednesday, September 22.

492
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,201
The 22nd.

493
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:12,321
it’s not here.

494
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:13,401
What?

495
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,001
it’s missing.

496
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,881
- Missing?
- Yeah.

497
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:19,241
Somebody erased it.

498
01:01:19,361 --> 01:01:22,441
- Who?
- Well, give me a minute.

499
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:27,561
Yeah, last viewed September 24.

500
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,481
Two days after she disappeared.

501
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,681
Who was the last person
to view those files?

502
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:36,761
Yeah, last viewed,
Henry David Schow.

503
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:38,121
Who's that?

504
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,361
He's the security guard l replaced.
The guy cut himself up and then quit.

505
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:45,441
They say he's gone totally Cray.

506
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,601
All after my sister went missing.

507
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,761
Can you pick me up?

508
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,481
Henry Schow?

509
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,481
Henry, you in there?

510
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:15,201
- Henry, is that you?
- Stay away from me.

511
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:17,961
Come on.
Henry, open the door.

512
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,841
l said stay away.

513
01:02:23,961 --> 01:02:28,041
Henry, we're not here to hurt you.
We just wanna ask a couple questions.

514
01:02:29,801 --> 01:02:32,001
Don't shut- Henry!

515
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:35,401
Who are you?

516
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,441
l'm your replacement at the Mayflower.
l'm the new night security guard.

517
01:02:41,401 --> 01:02:42,681
You've seen her then?

518
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:45,921
Seen who?

519
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,361
Her.

520
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,841
Eleanor.

521
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:54,361
What do you know about Eleanor?

522
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:56,961
Nothing'. l don't know nothing'.

523
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,281
Henry, you don't have to lie to us.

524
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:03,361
- l'm not lying!
- Yes, you are! What are you hiding?

525
01:03:04,841 --> 01:03:07,281
She wants to kill me.

526
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,561
Why does my sister want to kill you?

527
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,241
Your sister?

528
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:32,001
Henry, did you kill my sister?

529

No. l don't know

533
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,721
What files?

534
01:03:50,841 --> 01:03:52,801
The digitized security camera files.

535
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:54,961
The one from the night
she went missing.

536
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,961
The ones you erased, Henry.

537
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,161
l was just following orders!

538
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:04,401
Henry, who told you
to erase those files?

539
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,001
Mr. Landreaux, Keller Landreaux...

540
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,441
asked me to get rid of 'em,
said it was important.

541
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,321
- Keller.
- That's when your sister first showed up.

542
01:04:12,441 --> 01:04:14,321
That night.

543
01:04:14,441 --> 01:04:17,241
That's when she started
haunting all my mirrors.

544
01:04:17,361 --> 01:04:19,721
Henry, there's something
you're not telling us.

545
01:04:19,841 --> 01:04:22,001
l told you everything.

546
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,241
Henry, now, my sister
went missing the next day.

547
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,201
And somebody asked you to erase
those security files from the cameras...

548
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,881
and you didn't think that
was a little bit suspicious?

549
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:32,601
No, l didn't.
l didn't think that. l-

550
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,921
l just didn't wanna know.

551
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,841
Henry, you need to tell us everything
that happened that night. Everything.

552
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,281
l just want her to leave me alone.

553
01:04:45,401 --> 01:04:48,521
She's not goanna stop this
until she gets what she wants.

554

l went along with him.
