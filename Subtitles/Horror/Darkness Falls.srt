It is said that over 150 years ago,

in the town of Darkness Falls,

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,930
Matilda Dickson
was adored by all the children.

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:01,144
Whenever one of them lost a tooth,
they would bring it to her

6
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,856
in exchange for a gold coin...

"The Tooth Fairy."

One night, fire tore through
her home on Lighthouse Point,

so sensitive to light, she
could only go out at night,

They hanged her,

her hideous face to the light.
