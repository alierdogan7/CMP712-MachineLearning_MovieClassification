English subtitles: Praveen Nautie (Nautie)

9
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:09,831
You witnessed the murder of a girl. 
Talking will help you to understand that it is not your fault.

10
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:12,349
That would be a beauty. Let's just get this part.

11
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,296
Start telling me what happened that night in Newcastle.

12
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:19,180
- Do you remember the killer? - I see that devil every time I close my eyes.

13
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:23,916
- With "demon" you mean "killer". - With 'devil' I mean <i> demon </ i>, shit.

14
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,303
Disgusting creature. It smells like a butcher.

15
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:32,835
Look what happens, John. You feel guilty for failing to protect the girl, then ...

16
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:35,865
You make killer in this incarnation of evil.

17
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:38,335
We are all powerless against demons.

18
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,476
- Not all, boss. - Ah, yes ...

19
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:48,524
Before interning here three months ago, you worked as an exorcist, demonologist ...

20
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,634
- "Master of the Occult Arts"? - It says master, right?

21
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:56,998
I should switch to "amateur paltry". I hate to brag.

22
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:01,451
- Well, you did not stop the girl's death. - "Astra".

23
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:06,213
Her name was Astra.

24
00:02:06,214 --> 00:02:10,677
Do not care about his death. It is his conviction that drives me to despair.

25
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:13,013
- Dragged to Hell ... - John, it's time to face the truth.

26
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:15,278
Nine years, suffering for eternity.

27
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,697
- Only those who suffer here is you. - It's my fault, man.

28
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:21,000
- There are no demons. - You already said!

29
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:24,764
Now make me believe it.

30
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,753
That's what I paid you, is not it?

31
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:36,275
I want to be able to stop to do my rituals.

32
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:39,923
If I make a cup of tea I move nine times.

33
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:44,989
Here I am nine minutes to drink, so I sit for nine minutes.

34
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:48,991
Everything always in multiples of nine, you know?

35
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:50,992
But today ...

36
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:57,576
Today I stopped doing the ritual, and nothing horrible happened.

37
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:59,523
Only Mexican tea once.

38
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:35,795
Girl? Whatever you are painting here, better stop now.

39
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,103
Girl?

40
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:46,057
No. No, no, no ...

41
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:48,360
That's not my problem.

42
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:53,817
Shit ...

43
00:03:55,506 --> 00:04:00,030
I turn to the entity inside. Who are you? Say your name.

44
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,415
Listen to me!

45
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,586
In the name of the Creator, I command you to leave this place!

46
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:14,057

52
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,862

- What does it mean? - What I've been wasting my time here.

54
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,339
I have work to do.

55
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:21,251
She who did this.

57
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,878
- The girl above. - What?

58
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,952

Well, well! What have we here? Is in trouble, doll?

- Get back! - My name is John Constantine.

00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,139
This is the opposite side.

76
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:52,190
- I swear, I'm not standing behind you. - What are you talking about? Who is behind me?

77
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,412
It is possibly the "what", not "who".

If you do not listen to me, will be dead by morning.

81
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:06,441
I'll call the police.

82
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:12,049
If you're so determined to call the authorities ... They can find me here.

83
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,838
Or you can, if you like breathing.

00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:20,470
"Master of the occult arts" ...?

85
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:24,018
I'll make new cards.

86
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:45,889
Whoever it is, I'm a pretty nasty guy! Ask anyone.

87
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:56,707
- You should not be down here. - I can say the same for you.

88
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,070
- This here is the work of mining. - That's what I'm doing.

89
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:05,687
- What brings you back to the streets, John? - The girl, of course.

90
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:09,466
- An old friend asked me to protect her. - Must be a dead friend.

91
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:12,635
He made the request after owning a body, but could my attention.

92
00:10:12,636 --> 00:10:15,927
- Who are you? - You can call me Manny.

93
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,347
- I was told to take care of you. - "Take care of me"?

94
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:24,233
No offense, sir, I do not want angels on my ass. That would spoil my reputation.

95
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:29,952
- Hospice too. - Is it? Have I left. I'm great.

96
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:34,181
Hear that? I'm fine!

97

- Bate wings here. - You're not fine, John.

98
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:44,753
You ordered a girl to Hell. Along with your soul.

99
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:48,744
Now, I can not change your destiny, but can reduce their suffering.

100
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:54,902
- It will take advantage of the defeat of another will. - Their is estraordinÃ¡ria!

Do not worry about me, mate. I can handle an attack of the devil.

102
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:02,006
I'm not so sure. You spent time out of the game.

103
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:06,601
It has a lot of panic here. People feel what's coming.

104
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,641
And what is coming?

105
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,329
We should go.

106
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,349
Wait!

107
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:23,307
What is coming?

108
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:28,021
- You saved my life. 
- No problem, I work five minutes away.

109
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:31,130
Thank you, Talia. I really appreciate the ride.

110
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:34,493
I'm just glad you dodged that crazy. 
It looked like a rapist.

111
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:38,918
- Yeah, really scared me. 
- You sure you're okay?

112

00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:23,055
This is a crime scene.

118
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:26,436
Oh my god, Talia ...

119
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:28,637
Talia ...

120
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:00,624
What the fuck ...?

121
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,303
Calm! I'll get you there.

122
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:56,217
- Thanks for the ride. - Be careful.

123
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:02,874
You always go to the police?

124
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:07,534
My friend was killed last night.

125
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,247
Sorry about that.

126
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,264
I found on my door. What is it?

127
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:20,487
The Eye of Horus. 
Egyptian symbol of protection, so they say.

128
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:24,342
There was a man in the hallway 
yesterday. I think he killed Talia.

129
00:15:26,832 --> 00:15:30,763
Liv, meet Chas. My oldest friend.

130
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,098
He who has the symbol, which kept you alive.

131
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:37,177
- I'm glad you're okay. 
- He does not talk much.

132
00:15:37,446 --> 00:15:39,285
Now, to business.

133
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,797
If we do not get you to a safe place, 
the bodies will keep appearing.

134
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:45,292
Why would anyone want to kill me? I am a nobody.

135
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:48,074
I hate to end your happiness but you is not nobody.

136
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:53,029
I met his father, Jasper Winters. 
I promised him I would take care of you.

137
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,016
This is not possible. 
My father died before I was born.

138
00:15:57,454 --> 00:16:02,071
Who told you that was lying. 
Jasper died last year.

139
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:05,845
He was a good man.

140
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,235
So there you go.

141
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:14,020
Abra. Belonged to him. He wanted you to have this.

142
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:31,232
- Everybody out! Chas, take them here. 
- Come out!

143
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,984
That was my table. 
I should be sitting here.

144
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:37,670
Who is behind you can track you,
 feel your energy.

145
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:40,077
Will not give up until you are dead.

146
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:50,436
- Oh my God! Talia ...?

147
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,378
- She's alive! - Is not. Something is using it.

148
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,320
It's all wrong. They never act so openly.

149
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,678
Who are you? Who sent you?

150
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:13,512
- Liv? - Gone.

151
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,272
Wonder.

152
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:23,482
Mother, look into my eyes and say it again: when my father died?

153
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm not ready for that conversation.

154
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:31,382
You deprived me of it my whole life. 
I do not care if you do not want to talk now.

155
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,649
- Who was he? 
- He was just a guy.

156
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,843
I met him at a show. 
He did not want to see you after you were born.

157
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:42,360
And God knows that his grandmother
 - God rest her 
- did not encourage it.

158
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:47,151
- A friend of his found me. 
- Do not know how, Jasper did not know where we lived.

159
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:51,176
The man I met said it was his. 
Have you seen this before?

160
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:58,208
Liv ...? What?

161
00:17:58,422 --> 00:17:59,964
Grandma ...

162
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:07,307
Liv! Dear! What happened?

163
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:16,966
- What is happening to me? 
- Are you waking up. Seeing the world as it is.

164
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:19,548
- As your father. 
- That means what?

165
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:24,983
Holy impatience! The disease of the twenty-first century.

166
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,189
Where's the necklace?

167
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:31,762
Look around.

168
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:58,144
- What are they? - Souls. Trapped, looking for an exit.

169
00:18:58,251 --> 00:19:00,885
- You see them? - No.

170
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,232
What else do you see?

171
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:12,884
- There's a train coming. - It is?

172
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:19,486
What r u doing? Comes a train! Let me go!

173
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:22,017
What you 'doin? The train is coming!

174
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:27,825
We have to go off the rails! Let me go, let me go!

175
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:47,166
- What happened? - A ghost train.

176
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,867
The more involved the dead, but are vivid visions.

177
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:53,079
- All this is impossible. 
- Deny will not make it go away.

178
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,831
- How can I see these things? 
- Sounds like you have the gift of his father.

179
00:19:56,832 --> 00:20:00,808
When you touch the pendant, 
you concentrate your skill and see what he saw.

180
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:05,073
There are worlds beyond our own. Plans of parallel existence.

181
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:09,962
Entities between us ... Jasper could see it all.

182
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:13,263
He tried to teach me, but ...

183
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:18,053
- I had no talent. - You said you were coming.

184
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:22,141
We can talk later. Now, we are the prey.

185
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:24,164
Leave your car for your mother, you come with us.

186
00:20:36,122 --> 00:20:40,147
John would tell me about Jasper. I want to know how he died.

187
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:42,867
In Ragley.

188
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,853
- Were you there? - Enough.

189
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:49,455
Just thought what's behind me might want revenge for something that my father did.

190
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,827
I do not care why.

191
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:56,108
I just want to send it back and pay off my debt to his father.

192
00:20:56,844 --> 00:21:00,975
- Turn it off. - I can not.

193
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:08,460
Chas!

194
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:18,533
- John ...? - Astra?

195
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:23,301
Who is following me? Does it go away! Please!

196
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,008
Come here, I'll protect you.

197
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:31,555
- You will not catch her! 
- You can not save her ...

198
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:35,519
- Do not go! You will not get it! - John! Get me out of here!

199
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,420
- No. ..! - John!

200
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,848
John, get us out of here! Help us!

201
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:52,846
John helps us! My foot is stuck!

202
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:57,061
- Do something, please! - Okay, calm down!

203
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:16,920
The Santa Cruz commands you! 
The Star of David commands you!

204
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:21,852
The Lord commands you: Get out of this place!

205
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:26,202
Exit this place <i> Dispersum in Ventum </ i> (If disperse with the wind!)

206
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:29,116
Disappear now!

207
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,320
I think I caught him. Come forth, Chas!

208
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:36,994
The Lord commands you. The Lord commands you.

209
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:39,966
The Lord commands you!

210
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:46,024
Chas, beware!

211
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:48,587
- No. ..! - Do not!

212
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:56,522
There are millions of demons. 
We have to figure out which one you want dead.

213
00:22:56,523 --> 00:23:01,269
- Do not worry, you're safe here. 
- 'You're kidding! After what happened to Chas?

214
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,867
Things are not what they seem, love. If you want to get out of this alive, need to understand.

215
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:09,302
I do not understand half of what he says! You say something clararamente?

216
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:13,171
This house belonged to his father. If that day came ...

217
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:19,224
I promised I would put those keys in your hands.

218
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,442
Clear enough for you?

219
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:28,079
Jasper said I should take care of you. He had to keep away ...

220
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,573
- For your safety, naturally. - There is nothing natural about it.

221
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:47,221
This is crazy! Can you survive an apocalypse down here.

222
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:51,279
It is, or start one. Jasper used this place for divination.

223
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:56,730
Nobody found trouble faster than his father. Literally.

224
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:04,919
Put it there, love, before he "lower" you.

225
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:21,498
This looks like a map of Atlanta. What are these places?

226
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:25,029
- "Cascade of Illusions"? - Jasper called "mapping".

227
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,790
He started drawing the map itself, with things he saw.

228
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:32,059
- You said he thought trouble? - Divination with Crystals.

229
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,335
Place the pendant over a map for you to see.

230
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,502
Ah, here it is!

231
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:41,555
I thought the demon that is hunting you. Goes by the name Furcifer.

232
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:45,260
That bastard angel was right. The stakes are rising.

233
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:47,603
- What angel? - Nevertheless, Keep your eyes on the map.

234
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:50,465
Furcifer draws its power from electricity.

235
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:53,774
Can manifest in lightning and storms.

236
00:24:54,966 --> 00:24:59,058
In addition to controlling power lines, and ... dead bodies.

237
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,644
I still do not understand why.

238
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:04,175
You are a threat to the darkness that is rising.

239
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:06,942
Now you can see these things, they can see you.

240
00:25:06,943 --> 00:25:09,541
Most of them do not like to be seen.

241
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:13,011
Eleminar you are a precaution.

242
00:25:15,654 --> 00:25:19,086
- Ouch! - Secure! Let the blood drip.

243
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,056
- My god, what is this? - What you asked: trouble.

244
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,874
What blood showed?

245
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:35,606
Edgewood Avenue. And then have something bad going on there?

246
00:25:35,607 --> 00:25:38,333
Will happen. It is day now.

247
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:41,668
Most things that its powers located hunts at night.

248
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:45,001
- We should tell someone. - Not exactly have a service for this, right?

249
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:50,239
- We have to do something. - We're making. Keeping you alive.

250
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:54,438
I have an idea to end what is attacking you, but ...

251
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:59,623
- Means to use you as bait. - Why do you feel now 'doin' that?

252
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:04,361
I have a contact at the University of Ivy that can help. Just be quiet until I get back.

253
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:08,475

Can I help you, sir?

You know, there's a line between tÃªnua take charge and pursue.

256
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:28,093
I was right, right? Crazy down here.

257
00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:31,475
Can you open the door, please? My time is precious.

258
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:57,781
That's new.

259
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:10,364
- He discovered that the girl is hunting? - A demon elite.

260
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:11,813
Oh really ...?

261
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,709
And you think something can come here without much help?

262
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,576
Sounds like you want me to find out some information.

263
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,692
- I want to. - How come?

264
00:27:21,693 --> 00:27:25,900
We're here from the beginning, John. Beginning of time.

265
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:29,591
We were put here to guide the evolution of the human spirit.

266
00:27:29,592 --> 00:27:34,149
An invisible hand on his shoulder a whisper in the wind ...

267
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:39,233
- Not the most efficient way. - You want to do everything with their own hands.

268
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,374
Escorradio way, friend.

269
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:47,091
- That's what the First of the Fallen did. - For different purposes.

270
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:49,829
Listen. If you find out what we are facing,

271
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:52,754
I will use this information to save lives.

272
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:58,292
And my life? You condemned me to Hell.

273
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:04,082
Why should I risk my last days on Earth ...

274
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:09,446
Why, indeed? You are a sideshow.

275
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:12,078
- A vendedorzinho cheap magic. - Whoa there ...

276
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,568
Your decisions are questionable and without any conscience.

277
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,845
Why should you risk your spare time?

278
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,466
Because you are doomed to Hell.

279
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,539
At least so far.

280
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:39,710
Are you suggesting that it is not too late to save my soul?

281
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:46,327
All right, sir?

282
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:49,007
No.

Never.

You know, the cops Newcastle still looking for the man who killed Astra.

338
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:19,502
The Triangle of Solomon, with some ancient runes and Enochian alphabet.

339
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:22,557
When it arrives, you have to enter the circle.

340
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:26,107
The label will handle it, and I can send him to hell.

341
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:27,953
This should work.

342
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:32,764
It's time. Enter the circle.

343
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:40,936
No, no! It's my highest score.

344
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:50,783
- Where are you from, John? - The passion of my parents.

345
00:34:51,551 --> 00:34:54,212
- You do that a lot. - Do what?

346
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:56,549
- Hides emotions with humor. - I do, is it?

347
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:59,773
A strange mood, which makes me wonder if you're a sociopath.

348
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:04,617
Sorry if I do not drown in my feelings, I believe in repressing the past.

349
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:07,291
- What matters is where we are. - Do not believe it.

350
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:10,968
You risked your life to convince me that my past is important.

351
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:14,002
Come on, John, I'm trusting you with my life.

352
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:18,438
The least you can do is to share some personal detail.

353
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:21,503
My mother died at my birth.

354
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:25,003
It is a great detail.

355
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:28,086
My father said it was my fault.

356
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:34,105
He had a nickname for me, I heard all night.

357
00:35:34,256 --> 00:35:36,256
"Hello, killer!"

358
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:41,407
And every night since then he gave me a punch in the head and said:

359
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:45,046
"This is for what you did with your mother, murderer".

360
00:35:45,716 --> 00:35:51,521
- You imagine how his mother was? - There's no point imagining. I'll find it.

361
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:55,587
As a teenager, I started reading every book he could find on the occult.

362
00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:00,859
I learned spells, rituals, curses ... I learned to rely on dead things.

363
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:03,123
But her.

364
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:08,406
Not yet.

365
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:12,269
If you can summon people, may invoke my father?

366
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:14,534
You would not like the outcome.

367
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:17,358
Prepare yourself.

368
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:27,058
- I told you to call me. - Do not you wanna stay here.

369
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,006
Oh, he wants to, yes.

370
00:36:30,382 --> 00:36:32,277
Not the guard.

371
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:39,881
Stay there, Liv.

372
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:44,759
You killed that good man. I should have foreseen this.

373
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,138
You want it, boss? Come and get it.

374
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,093
If you insist ...

375
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:09,805
<i> Hic incipit of existing world ... </ i>

376
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:12,745
<i> In nomine Dei udders ... From hoc existing world ... </ i>

377
00:37:12,747 --> 00:37:14,460
<i> In nomine Dei udders ... </ i>

378
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:17,727
Nergal said in its ritual power lack of intent.

379
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:23,058
Liv, run!

380
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,532
John!

381
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:30,322
Thought he could ambush me? That could use electricity?

382
00:37:30,622 --> 00:37:32,802
Night ...

383
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:43,377
In this place I am a God.

384
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:45,131
That reminds me.

385
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:46,974
I almost forgot.

386
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,134
Hope it works, John ...

387
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:11,381
- What happened? - "Power of intention."

388
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,820
Let me out, John. I release the soul of the Astra.

389
00:38:34,822 --> 00:38:36,693
As if you could ...

390
00:38:40,674 --> 00:38:43,335
John, are you?

391
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:45,573
- Astra ...? - John!

392
00:38:49,005 --> 00:38:52,710
I wanna go home ... take me home!

393
00:38:56,011 --> 00:39:00,901
Release me, and her soul will be free.

394
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:08,917
John, I'm afraid!

395
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,526
<i> Ethera me ... </ i>

396
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,528
<i> Aperi Circulum ... </ i>

397
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:22,433
<i> potest berius evicte ... </ i>

398
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,728
Stop John, is not the Astra. Not her.

399
00:39:30,526 --> 00:39:32,775
I'm afraid ...

400
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:42,161
Think you can control my life? I got news for you, pal!

401
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:48,168
I'm behind the Astra. I go after Nergal.

402
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:51,909
Can pass it on, in Hell.

403
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:54,866
<i> In Christo cuam ignis ... </ i>

404
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:56,976
Ex hoc <i> that this ... </ i>

405
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,095
John!

406
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,540
<i> Et testo, solid ex facto </ i>

407
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:03,504
<i> ... Ex Constantine </ i>

408
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:23,412
You 'okay?

409
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:27,941
Have a friend down there will take you home.

410
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:35,783
Go!

411
00:40:44,013 --> 00:40:45,629
Who is Astra?

412
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:50,355
She was the daughter of a friend of ours in Newcastle, England.

413
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:55,468
Was possessed by a demon. John made his way ...

414
00:40:55,857 --> 00:40:58,991
Invoked an even more powerful demon.

415
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:02,337
- Nergal? - He said he would ...

416
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,774
Order him to take away the lowest demon.

417
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:08,976
- But he was led Astra? - It's ...

418
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:12,586
After ripping it to pieces in front of us.

419
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:18,021
Look, even John believes he has everything under control.

420
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:22,679
Do you believe that. It's the "magic" of it.

421
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:25,501
But also his curse.

422
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,808
If I were you, I'd stay away from him, Liv.

423
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:33,468
I can not tell you that, but he wanted his father had said.

424
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,414
This is the Edgewood Avenue.

425
00:41:37,777 --> 00:41:41,378
John told me to use the crystal that avenue today and appeared on the map.

426
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,524
Stop, stop the car.

427
00:41:49,391 --> 00:41:54,813
Let me go, let me go! What ...?

428
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:59,068
Who would ... Who would ...?

429
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:02,552
Who would do that to a kid ...?

430
00:42:11,785 --> 00:42:16,146
A teenager was killed tonight. On Edgewood Avenue.

431
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:18,731
We knew something was going to happen and I could not stop!

432
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:20,991
Forget this philosophy, that will leave you crazy.

433
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:22,946
Or we can save innocent lives!

434
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:26,756
I have to find out if anyone else is having problems.

435
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:29,871
I went to the library, I used the guessing game with the crystal and look:

436
00:42:29,872 --> 00:42:31,997
It is happening everywhere!

437
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:36,088
Accept advice: go back to the rental car, living in a hole hobbit.

438
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:38,444
- It will keep you safe. - I do not care to be sure!

439
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:45,678
Not with people dying! I need to find these people and prevent, as my father. But ...

440
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,004
- I can not do this alone. - You're sniffing the wrong post.

441
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:52,663
I paid my debt to your father, you're alive.

442
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:54,819
If you will not do for them, make the Astra.

443
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,327
- Write her loss worthwhile. - I'll think about it.

444
00:43:06,882 --> 00:43:08,406
Thanks, buddy.

445
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,838
Congratulations. You made her believe that it was all her idea.

446
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:19,062
Easy. Was difficult to convince Richie to divert ten blocks up the avenue.

447
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,926
- Why did not you help her? - She does not trust me.

448
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:24,571
It had to be her idea.

449
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:28,748
A pity. That man in Edgewood Avenia lost his life.

450
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:32,760
"Sorrow" is what I face every day.

451
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:36,487
Liv and the boy would die tonight.

452
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,710
I could only save one.

453
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:42,131
So ... you're going to hell ...

454
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,227
You will find that kind of strength we are facing.

455
00:43:45,228 --> 00:43:48,268
- It's what you wanted, right? - I have to ask ...

456
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:53,656
You are doing it to save lives ... Or save your miserable soul?

457
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:58,484
It's a trick question. I will not answer.

458
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,339
Pays the bill? I owe the bastard ''re ignoring me.

459
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,081
<i> My name is John Constantine. </ i>

460
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:26,055
<i> I am the one who comes out of the shadows, wearing an overcoat and arrogance. </ i>

461
00:44:26,056 --> 00:44:30,782
