        (woman moaning)

00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,715
           (panting)

5
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:43,028
           (giggling)

6
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,076
                        - Hurry!

7
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,245
                        Get him!

8
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:03,148
                     Over there!

9
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,289
                  Where are you?

10
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,938
          Gotcha now.

11
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:32,244
If you wanted to play house, all
     you had to do was ask.

12
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:42,955
Haven't you ever
kissed a girl before?

13
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,657
Aww, it's easy.

14
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,595
All you do is close your eyes
and pucker up.

15
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,097
Like this.

16
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,248
           (laughing)

17
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,919
             Mm-mm.

18
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,488
                    We wanna see
              what's down there.

19
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:23,328
              I'll show you mine
           if you show me yours.

20
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,272
      Come on, lover boy.

21
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:44,316
           (laughing)
           That's it?

22
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:47,152
Looks like an acorn!

23
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,425
            - Mmm...

24
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,862
  - Hey, come back! Come back!

25
00:04:56,864 --> 00:05:00,599
     Come back, lover boy!

26
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,212
         (door opening)

27
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,281
       Bye! See you soon!

28
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:17,743
        (twigs cracking)

29
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:24,916
          (screaming)

00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:31,623

31
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,464
           (gasping)

32
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,733
            Help...

33
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,936
           Please...

34
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,712
         Please help...

35
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,235
       I'm sorry! What...

36
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,538
         I was kidding.

37
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,449
       No... No! Please!

38
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:34,085
   I'll do whatever you want!
           I'm sorry!

39
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,289
           Please...

40
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,926
        I'm begging you,
        I'm begging you!

41
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,728
        No, no, please!

42
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,531
          (screaming)

43
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,600
          (splashing)

44
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,648
 (children's laughter echoing)

45
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,866
       (messages binging)

46
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:23,328
           (exhaling)

47
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,833
           - ...Well?

48
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:36,508
           (scoffing)
          "All right"?

49
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,911
        Honey, this here
   is some Grade A prime rib.

50
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,987
     We've been over this.

51
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,323
     I don't have a choice.

52
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,092
       - You could always
          sell drugs.

53
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,761
   - Oh, my God, what are you...
       Go back to your computer,

54
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,264
     I wasn't done with my show.

55
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,533
  Uh, okay, then get in here and
 close the door, I'm buck naked.

56
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,568
       - Well, you better
        get used to it.

57
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,971
It is your new business attire.
     - Joke all you want,

58
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:09,207
but it's either this
or drop out of school.

59
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,044
 - I thought you said your mom
        could swing it?

60
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,046
- The tuition and her mortgage?
           I mean...

61
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,215
 - Not without my dad's income.
         Not for long.

62
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,217
 - Well, breaking news for ya,

63
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,319
      there are other ways
      a gal can earn cash

64
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,656
 besides flashing her vertical
  smile all over cyberspace.

65
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,225
          Look, Kylie,

66
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,161
   you're better than this -

67
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,565
            and I strongly doubt
         your dad would approve.

68
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:37,168
All right, look; it's not
prostitution, or even stripping.

69
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,538
There's no sleazy men slipping
singles into my g-string
while copping a feel.

70
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,108
   - Yeah, but it's porn, Kylie!

71
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,611
Technically. But it's not like
skanky<i> Boogie Nights</i> porn.

72
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,680
I mean, it's just me
and a few unmanned cameras

73
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:52,183
doing things I'd probably
be doing anyways.

74
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:56,821
Metal and glass - that's all.

75
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,823
    - And a whole wide world

76
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,426
   of douchebags whacking off
       on the other side!

77
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,695
       Ugh... I gotta go.

78
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,798
         Have fun with
    your little nudie site.

79
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,778
           (giggling)

80
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,181
  -<i> My name's Mia. Welcome to</i>
    Girlhouse.<i> Come inside!</i>

82
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,765
      (rock music playing)
        -<i> Come on, boys. </i>

83
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:45,470
 <i> I'm so wet and ready for you.</i>
            (beep)

84
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:51,943
           (moaning)
      -<i> Oh, yeah. Yeah... </i>

85
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,846
          <i> Oh, oh...</i>

86
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,849
          <i> Oh, mm...</i>

87
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,522
        (phone ringing)

88
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,325
    -<i> Hi, you've reached the</i>
   <i> voicemail of Linda Atkins,</i>

89
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,327
   <i> please leave a message.</i>
            (beep)

90
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,329
     - Hey, Mom, it's me.
    Great news... Um, I got

91
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,999
  a part-time job working for
     one of my professors.

92
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,903
It pays really well, so I'll be
 able to send you some money.

93
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,006
    Also, I decided to move
 off campus with some friends.

94
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:25,043
 It's way cheaper and way more
   spacious than the dorms.

95
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:28,646
     Oh, yeah, and, wait,
     here's the best part:

96
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,182
  I got this scholarship that
     begins next semester,

97
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,184
       so you won't have
       to pay my tuition

98
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:38,556
 from now on. I miss you, Mom.
        Talk soon. Bye.

99
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:44,829
        - Kylie Atkins!
    What changed your mind?

100
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,366
        - Got my eye on
      a new pair of shoes.

101
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,741
  - (Gary): My detractors say
  I'm just some smut pedlar,

102
00:12:56,743 --> 00:13:00,512
  preying on the weaknesses of
      young women and men.

103
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,814
       I say screw them.

104
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:06,651
     The fact is, I'm one
     of the fastest-rising
   entrepreneurs in America.

105
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,220
          I'm no pimp.

106
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,790
      I'm the Hugh Hefner
     for the 21st century.

107
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:16,694
     - Um, about the pay.
  Can I really expect to make

108
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,897
      as much as you said?
           - Minimum.

109
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,366
   Anything above base salary
         is up to you.

110
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,702
We track every eyeball and every
 girl every second of the day.

111
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:28,273
   You bring dollars, you get
   rewarded. Sky's the limit.

112
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,775
            - Now...

113
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,977
How do I make sure one of these
guys doesn't end up stalking me?

114
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,979
      - Today,<i> Girlhouse </i>
      is the most secure,

115
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,516
 technologically advanced site
         of its kind.

116
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,386
 My team of top engineers work
       around the clock

117
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,621
  from an untraceable location
           to ensure

118
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,957
  that<i> Girlhouse</i> can never be
      tracked or hacked.

119
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:54,632
     Team, say hi to Kylie.

120
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,535
     - (all):<i> Hi to Kylie.</i>

121
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:01,005
          - Bye, team.
     With this little baby,

122
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,475
I can monitor and control every
   aspect of the site 24/7.

123
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,477
     Cameras, microphones,

124
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,414
 computers - I can block it all
   with the push of a button.

125
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,318
   <i> Girlhouse</i> is pretty much
   the Fort Knox of websites.

126
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,429
           (moaning)

127
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:30,201
        - Um... How much
      of that is required?

128
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,570
 - Uh, nothing's ever required.

129
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,672
    Everything and everyone
     you do is up to you.

130
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,444
  Look, when I approached you
   in the quad last spring,

131
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,047
 it was because I could see you
     were someone special.

132
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,317
         I knew you had
   what it takes to be a hit.

133
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,129
          Here we are.

134
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,365
        Home sweet home.

135
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,901
           After you.

136
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,081
             Steve.
        - (Steve): Gary.

137
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,183
        - This is Kylie,
      our newest resident.

138
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,185
          - Pleasure.
             - Hi.

139
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,422
      - Steve and Big Mike
       oversea security.

140
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,557
 Along with the perimeter wall
           out back,

141
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,494
     they're our low-tech
     last line of defence.

142
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,898
    - How often do you have
     to turn people away?

143
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,768
- Uh, a few times a year
some college chump

144
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,604
follows one of the girls home.
No big deal.

145
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,440
 - Yeah. Especially when you're
   an ex-NC State linebacker.

146
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,923
      (TV playing quietly)

147
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,336
   - (TV):<i> Okay, so now we're</i>
    <i> at this nice state...</i>

148
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,404
         - Shit, Gary!

149
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,740
        You didn't say
      you were coming by!

150
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:19,143
   - And that's Kat. She's...

151
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,512
        Well, she's Kat.
        (door slamming)

152
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,884
        Uh, we have over

153
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,520
  50 cameras around the house.

154
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:33,391
   I encourage you to utilize
      as many as you can.

155
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:37,195
  - So, like, hundreds of guys
   are watching us right now?
          - Thousands,

156
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,263
      at any given moment.

157
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:47,805
     - Why do they want to watch
 all the boring stuff like this?

158
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,974
    - well, it gives members
         the sensation

159
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,010
of actually getting to know you.

160
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,012
 - It's what makes us different
       from other sites.

161
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,681
   - (Gary): There's our Kat.
 - These guys will fall in love

162
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,683
  with you, 'cause they're not
     getting just the sex,

163
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,852
        they're getting
       a full experience.

164
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,987
        It's kinda like
       they live with us.

165
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:06,457
       - Except each girl's full
 identity is always kept secret.

166
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,127
    Members can never figure out
            where or who you are

167
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,496
                   in real life,

168
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,498
       and if some random viewer
             does recognize you,

169
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,834
              we block or delete
    any attempt to broadcast it.

170
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,305
   - Should we take the tour?

171
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,750
         That's Devon,
      our main attraction.

172
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,720
             Devon.

173
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,489
This is Kylie, our new roommate.

174
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,726
           (chuckles)

175
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,529
         - A little on
 the wholesome side, eh, Gare?

176
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:49,167
        Hope she doesn't
      devalue the product.

177
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,137
- She thinks you're competition.
    Take it as a compliment.

178
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,206
            Come on.

179
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:01,712
            Okay...
           (knocking)

180
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,248
     (loud music playing)
   That's Janet. She's doing

181
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,884
a chat right now, probably with
 a bunch of millionaire execs.

182
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,554
         She's big with
     the Fortune 500 crowd.

183
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,756
    - That's 'cause I'm all
      business, bitches!

184
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,125
 - This is Kylie, the new girl.

185
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,328
    - Hey, girl. Okay, boys,

186
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,031
 you wanna see my spreadsheet?

187
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,133
           - Okay...

188
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,069
       - Get that. Yeah!

189
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,039
           (knocking)

190
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,642
    This is Heather's room.
      She's the wild one.

191
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,812
           (moaning)

192
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:38,416
 Also the loudest in the sack.

193
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,585
When she's knocking boots you're
      gonna hear about it.

194
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,587
          Literally,
    the whole house shakes.

195
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,823
      - Hey! Gare, thought
     I heard you out there.

196
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:49,260
 - Hey, Heather, this is Kylie.
     - Hey, hun. Pleasure.

197
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,963
Gare, you still owe me for that
  3-way last week, remember?

198
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,199
- Oh, God, I'm sorry. I forgot.
    I'll get on that, okay?

199
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,536
            - Okay.
          - All right.

200
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,872
   Good luck, and live sexy.
      (Heather laughing)

201
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,975
           Take care.
        (blowing kisses)

202
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,277
- Okay, come on.

203
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:16,087
   - Here it is. New girl always
           gets the third floor.

204
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:26,097
        - It's perfect.

205
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,366
        - Here you are.
            - Hey!

206
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,404
         I missed you.

207
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,773
      Kylie, this is Mia,

208
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:39,377
         my girlfriend.
             - Hey.

209
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,880
            - Hey.
     - I know, I know what
   you're probably thinking,

210
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,449
  "How do they justify living
 here, doing this for all those

211
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,019
 sleazy guys out there," but we
  don't look at it like that.

212
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,288
The members may not necessarily
        be our fantasy,

213
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,691
 but we definitely are theirs.

214
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,195
      And they're not all
   creepy losers. You'll see.

215
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,330
            Come on.

216
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,399
              Bye!

217
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,753
  - (Kylie): And you all go to
         Selby College?

218
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,755
       - (Kat): Are you kidding?
  I dropped out when I found out

219
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,024
     how much money I could make
          here. It's ridiculous.

220
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,860
- Mm-hmm. No college for this
girl. Gary found me in Vegas.

221
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,862
       - Stripping, or...
             - No.

222
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,898
Making $5 foot-longs
at Subway.

223
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
- Now she puts about 5
foot-longs in her subway

224
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,569
          each week.
- Yeah, for a lot more than $5.

225
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,072
      - (laughing): Yeah!
        (all laughing)

226
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:45,076
 - (Devon): Yeah, I go to Selby,
but that's not where I met Gary.

227
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,145
       I was in a bikini contest
                 in South Beach,

228
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:51,382
    he was judging. I offered to
       blow him for first place.

229
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,252
           - ...And?
  - I didn't realize there was

230
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,521
                 a second judge,
           and I came in second.

231
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,691
- (Janet): Okay, what about you?
What's your story?

232
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,527
       - I'm from Topeka.
           - Mm-hmm.

233
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,530
          - Siblings?
      - I'm an only child.

234
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,200
   - What do your parents do?
    - My mom is a housewife.

235
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,669
                   - Hmm, sweet.
            What about your dad?

236
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:15,439
- He, um... He passed away.

237
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,009
             - Oh, I'm so sorry.

238
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:21,045
        Recently, or...
     - Like, 3 months ago.

239
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,784
- But anyway, I'm really happy
to know about

240
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,420
  the off-camera room. I might
 need to use the bathroom there

241
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,756
 until I get more comfortable.
            - Yeah.

242
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,758
   - (Heather): Some guys pay
     serious coin for that.

243
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,826
             - Ew!
       - Shut, up, Devon,

244
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:39,163
      you fucking love it.
- (Devon): Okay, ladies, ladies,

245
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:42,867
    ladies, I think it's time...

246
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,770
            - Oh...
       - (Kylie): Time...

247
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:48,606
        - Time for what?
        - To get naked!

248
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,608
  (all laughing and cheering)

249
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,477
            (typing)

250
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,383
    - Okay, boys. Here I am.

251
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,653
      - Okay, remember -
  just you and your computer.

252
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:20,504
      - No tricks, but...

253
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,008
     ...maybe a few treats.

254
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:34,118
              ¶¶¶

255
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:44,729
              ¶¶¶

256
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,797
 - ¶ Well, I've flown around ¶

257
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,168
   ¶ Gone from town to town ¶

258
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,071
        ¶ But I never ¶

259
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:01,412
        ¶ I'd never met
       someone like you ¶

260
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,492
           - I don't know, Gare.
It's a little junior high to me.

261
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:18,295
   - Just give her a minute.

262
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,542
   - (laughing): Oh, really?

263
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:34,979
    Are you here for these?

264
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,982
          (chuckling)

265
00:23:56,235 --> 00:24:02,807
      - Here we go, gang.

266
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,777
 - ¶ Oh, the words that I sow ¶

267
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,549
    ¶ They let it be known ¶

268
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,618
         - Damn, girl!

269
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,687
           Nice rack.

270
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,632
             - Yes!

271
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,935
  I knew this girl would kill.

272
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:33,270
       - (woman): Jimmy,
       time for dinner.

273
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:38,709
      - In a minute Mom,
      I'm doing homework.

274
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,448
        (phone ringing)

275
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,910
        - (Ben): Dude,
      clean up your shit.

276
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,479
- Dude, dude, shut up. You gotta
 get in here and see this girl,

277
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,448
     right now. Right now!
         - All right,

278
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,517
 you can clean up later, then.

279
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,157
                - Fuckin' way...

280
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,927
        - I know, right?
         Hot as balls.

281
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,230
 - No, dude; I know that girl.
          (scoffing)

282
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:36,667
                    I'm serious,
            that's Kylie Atkins.
      I went to school with her.

283
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,671
   - You know this creature?
         Not possible.

284
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:43,607
Okay...

285
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:46,043
  - Dude, what are you doing?

286
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,178
- Why, are you in love with her?
          - What? No!

287
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,715
    - Oh, my God. How long?

288
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:57,655
        - Kindergarten.
      - Does she know?...
     Naw, that makes sense.

289
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:00,524
          - You're a total dork,
                    and she's...

290
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:04,728
            ...that.

291
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,102
      - You are a natural!
           (laughing)

292
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,205
 - I loved it. How did it feel?
      - You know, just me
        and my computer.

293
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,644
      - Oh! It's Loverboy.

294
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:23,581
     He's always on here.
     He's a total sweetie.

295
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,649
       You should say hi.

296
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:31,589
<i>Sorry, Loverboy, you just missed</i>
<i>me. Can you come back tomorrow?</i>

297
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,625
    <i> We'll chat one-on-one.</i>

298
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:40,631
           <i> You bet.</i>

299
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:46,070
 <i> That works, I'll look for you.</i>

300
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:48,072
   <i> By the way, great handle.</i>

301
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,641
<i>Anyone with "love" in their name</i>
        <i> is okay by me.</i>

302
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:56,380
      (breathing heavily)

303
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:04,722
          (rewinding)

304
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:08,225
<i>Anyone with "love" in their name</i>
        <i> is okay by me.</i>

305
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,844
       (muffled moaning)

306
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,435
     (moaning gets louder)

307
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:55,673
      -<i> Aw, yeah... Oh...</i>

308
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,355
         - (Alex): Wow.

309
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:21,225
       You are really not
       taking this well.

310
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:24,128
            - Yo...

311
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,130
- Think about it this way, man.

312
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,132
   From now on, you literally
        get to jerk off

313
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,734
      to your dream girl.
  - She goes to Selby College,

314
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:34,004
           actually.
    - Like, Selby in Milton?

315
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,006
           - Mm-hmm.
       Dude, that's like,

316
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,809
70 miles from here. You gotta go
  get her. I'm serious; dude,

317
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:41,512
she's not only right around the
    corner, she's gettable.

318
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:44,715
          "Gettable"?
 Why, 'cause she's doing porn?

319
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:47,217
   - Exactly! Dude, it's got
      self-esteem issues

320
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,787
     written all over it.
  - No, you don't understand.

321
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,989
 There must be an explanation.
       Kylie was always

322
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,991
  the hottest girl in Topeka,

323
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:56,994
  but she was never...a slut.

324
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,930
   - How would you know that?

325
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,932
You said it yourself, you were
too much of a pussy to ever

326
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,501
talk to her, so why don't you
drop some fertilizer

327
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,603
down on those floors, and grow
your little apple seeds

328
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,806
into Granny Smiths
and go get her!

329
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:12,409
  -Mm-hmm, yes. Gonna do that.

330
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,812
      - Fucking gorgeous.

331
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,553
      (footsteps falling)

332
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,719
        (gate unlocking)

333
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,678
           (giggling)
     - Drink up, buttercup!

334
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:36,860
   (electronic lock opening)

335
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,929
 - (Heather): We need to switch
       shots for clothes.

336
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,931
- (Devon): Strip war? Hell yeah!
         - Yeah, yeah.

337
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:44,768
 - (counting cards): "Go-suck-
    cock-for-a-liv-ing..."

338
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,972
             Fuck!
       (Heather laughing)

339
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,974
 Lady luck over here! What, did
     you fuck a leprechaun

340
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:55,712
          last night?
    - Shirt's off, sourpuss.

341
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,454
       - Perfect... Ahh!
       (glass shattering)

342
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:09,026
 You scared the crap out of me!

343
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,028
- What are you doing here?
You know you're not supposed

344
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,330
          to be here.
   - Gary's gonna be pissed.

345
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:17,167
 - Whatever. I had nowhere else
      to go. I'm broke and
        homeless, okay?

346
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,772
   - Anyways, I'm clean now,
      so I can come back.

347
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:25,042
 - I highly doubt you're clean.
      - And Gary's already
         replaced you.

348
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:28,078
      - What? You serious?

349
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,148
         That's my bed!

350
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:35,085
        - She's pretty.
        - ...And nice.

351
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,654
 - ...And not a heroin addict.

352
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,161
  - Gary, if you're watching,

353
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:47,431
     <i> I swear I'll be good</i>
         <i> from now on.</i>

354
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:51,668
   <i> Besides, you need some</i>
   <i> latin</i> panocha<i> up in here,</i>

355
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,672
 <i> give this house some flavour.</i>

356
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:59,009
    Look, I'm off the crank,
    I promise, just give me
        one more chance.

357
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,082
       You sure you wanna
        give up on this?

358
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,991
         (Gary typing)

359
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:15,993
        (tablet pinging)

360
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:20,097
    - He says you can stay
    on the couch...for now.

361
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,000
- Thank you so much, papi, I...

362
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,469
 I won't let you down, I swear.

363
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:31,675
 (women shouting and laughing)

364
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,047
 - (Heather): Okay, who's next?

365
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,449
   - (Janet )I need you guys
       cheering for me!

366
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,719
         Ready, girls?
         Pay attention!

367
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,088
           (cheering)

368
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,290
       Whose turn is it?
          Who's next?

369
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,426
        - (Devon): Woo!

370
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:53,130
          (chuckling)

371
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:30,033
 - (Loverboy): Is that coconut?

372
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:37,674
        I've missed you.

373
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:40,744
    - (girl):<i> Gotcha now...</i>

374
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,220
           (mumbling)

375
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,834
           You got clean for me?

376
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:10,073
           (sniffing)

377
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:14,644
     I knew it was coconut.

378
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,739
             - Hey.

379
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,741
       - Linda Lovelace,

380
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,310
         in the flesh.

381
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,514
   Saw your show last night.
    Definitely got me hard.

382
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:53,683
 The house looks nice though -
 score. When are you going to
    invite me over for tea?

383
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,286
   - No can do. The location
        is top secret.

384
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,288
    - Really? What about all
    the guys that come over

385
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,857
    to pork your brains out?
     - They are blindfolded

386
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,859
       on the drive over.
       - You're kidding.

387
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:05,362
             - No.
            - Kinky.

388
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,697
        (phone ringing)
         (hanging up)

389
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:11,768
         Tell her yet?
  - I'm really not too worried

390
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,038
     about her logging on
  and finding out, so...nope.

391
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,359
      - Kylie... Wow! Hey.

392
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,962
          - Uh, hi...
            - Yeah.

393
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:42,332
  - Ben Stanley. What are you
doing here, do you go to Selby?

394
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:45,302
- No, I don't, actually, I go to
  Old North Tech in Charlotte.

395
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:47,304
But I have a chemistry lab here,

396
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:50,140
         twice a week.
             - Oh.

397
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:52,542
 - So, wow! It's so good to see
    you. Were you in Topeka
          this summer?

398
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,644
           - ...Yeah.

399
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:57,247
- 'Cause I... I didn't see you.
         - I didn't...

400
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,549
        ...get out much.

401
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,851
         My...dad died.

402
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,788
  - Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

403
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,023
             Wow...

404
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,392
         Well, I mean,
    I didn't know your dad,

405
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,628
     but if he contributed
        to making you,

406
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,765
       he must have been
        pretty awesome.

407
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:19,469
     You look different...
       from high school.

408
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,905
       Late growth spurt,
      that's what that is.

409
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,474
    - Well, it's good to...
    - Hey, do you wanna...

410
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:27,410
   Sorry, do you wanna maybe
   go for coffee some time?

411
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,146
       Or like, a snack?
          - "Snack"?

412
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:32,182
     - Yeah... I don't know
       why I said snack.

413
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:34,451
 - Um... Yeah, that'd be great.

414
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,753
    - Cool, when...should we
            do that?

415
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,022
        - Gimme a call.
            - Okay.

416
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:47,097
   - Wait, is that the time?
            - Yeah.

417
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,099
         - I gotta go.
    - Where? I'll walk you.

418
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:51,935
   - No, um... No, it's okay.
      I... Across campus.

419
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,771
    It's far away. Call me!

420
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,400
     (message tone binging)

421
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:26,670
 Hey, Loverboy, sorry I'm late.

422
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,245
      Aww, not this girl.
       Let's go private.

423
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,753
             So...

424
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:46,289
Do you want me to get undressed?

425
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,693
     (message tone binging)
            - Oh...

426
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:53,563
          Just talk.
          (chuckling)

427
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:57,300
   Okay, sure. I can do that.

428
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,539
 <i> What do you wanna talk about?</i>

429
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,508
   - (girl's voice):<i> Come on,</i>
          <i> lover boy!</i>

430
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,147
 - (Kylie):<i> Um.. The girls say</i>

431
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,516
 <i> you're something of a regular.</i>

432
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,691
<i>I like that. Means you're loyal.</i>

433
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:29,165
   <i> What do you do for work?</i>

434
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:40,677
    <i> Oh, like programming?</i>

435
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:45,181
     How do you like that?

436
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:51,588
       Oh, that's...nice.

437
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,427
            <i> Aww...</i>

438
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,130
   <i> Thanks, Loverboy. You too.</i>

439
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:08,938
      <i> What do you mean?</i>

440
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:20,450
      True, but sometimes
      you can just tell.

441
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:31,795
       <i> Well, I'm sure</i>
    <i> you're very handsome.</i>

442
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:44,007
   <i> Are you sure you don't</i>
   <i> want me to get undressed?</i>

443
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,141
         <i> It's okay,</i>
   <i> it's what I'm here for.</i>

444
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,178
        (phone buzzing)

445
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:54,651
   <i> Sorry, Loverboy, can we</i>
   <i> pick this up another time?</i>

446
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:11,568
   <i> Wait, how did you do that?</i>
   <i> Gary said this place was</i>

447
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,604
    <i> impossible to hack...</i>

448
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:19,976
      <i> - Yes, Loverboy,</i>
   <i> I think you're beautiful.</i>

449
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:24,581
             <i> Bye.</i>

450
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:36,559
   - It's weird, we've known
      each other since...

451
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,195
- Since kindergarten... I think.

452
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,197
            - Yeah.
           (laughing)

453
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,200
And this is the first time we've
   actually really hung out.

454
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,603
        - That is weird.

455
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:48,905
       - Who else do you
 keep in touch with from home?

456
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:51,708
  - Oh, just my close friends.
      You know, my homies.

457
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,877
             Um...

458
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:56,679
        What about you?

459
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,748
       - No one, really.

460
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,284
     It's weird, you know,
    sometimes it feels like

461
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:04,354
 you have so many friends one
minute, and then you leave home

462
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,356
and you're basically all alone.

463
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:08,358
   - It's hard to picture you
        as not popular.

464
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,395
  - I mean, I have friends...

465
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:15,698
     - And now you have me.

466
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,202
         - I do, do I?

467
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,205
           - Mm-hmm.

468
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,444
           (laughing)

469
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:04,113
 - Uh, well, this is me, so...

470
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:08,184
          - Very nice.

471
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:12,755
- Hey, uh, you know there's this
      matinee on Saturday

472
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,758
        of<i> Rear Window, </i>
      it's playing at that

473
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,161
  old theatre by the river...

474
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,563
 - Do you have a chemistry lab
       on Saturday, too?

475
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,665
- Oh... Yeah, no, no, no. Um...

476
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:26,235
  But Hitchcock is definitely
   worth the 70-mile drive.

477
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:29,105
           (laughing)
 - Yeah, I'll see you Saturday.

478
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,040
      - See you Saturday.

479
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:37,213
- Good night.

480
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:40,249
                   - Good night.

481
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:44,320
           (dialling)

482
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,990
           (ringing)
         - It's Kylie.

483
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:51,260
   I need a pick-up. Thanks.

484
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:58,534
      - (Alex): How's that
        exam prep going?

485
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:01,304
You know, I think you might be
the only straight person I know

486
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,740
        to turn it off
    when the nudity starts.

487
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,742
         Which does beg
  the interesting question of,

488
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,744
       you are straight,

489
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:11,481
          aren't you?
           - Dude...

490
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,983
      I'm gonna tell her.

491
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,920
        ...That I know.
       - About<i> Girlhouse?</i>

492
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:21,424
        Bad idea, dude.
       - Okay, um... Why?

493
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:23,926
  - If she knows, then she'll
think that you think she's easy.

494
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:26,896
  Any girl on a site like this
        must be a whore.

495
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:28,898
   - But I don't think that.

496
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,067
 - It's not gonna matter, dude.

497
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:34,704
You wanna keep this thing going,
then trust me: do not tell her.

498
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,677
        (phones ringing)

499
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,420
                    - Excuse me.

500
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:34,464
                             Hi.

501
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:45,007
         Wow, looks intimidating
                       in there.

502
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,610
        You must be pretty smart
         if you know how to work

503
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:50,079
    all those wires and buttons.

504
00:45:51,883 --> 00:45:54,350
      I've always been attracted
                   to smart men.

505
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:56,619
                Men with brains.

506
00:45:56,621 --> 00:46:00,690
           But do you wanna know
               what's not smart?

507
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:04,293
                What's not smart
         is coming to a job site

508
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,963
     and then sexually harassing
           one of the employees.

509
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:09,832
      I saw what you were doing.

510
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,001
             Tongue hanging out,

511
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:14,237
          like some thirsty dog.

512
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,973
           Get a good peek? Hmm?

513
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:20,543
          One word to your boss,

514
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:22,545
          I could have you fired
                      like this.

515
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:25,915
   Next time, think twice before
      preying on innocent women.

516
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:28,518
                         Got it?

517
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,553
                         I said,

518
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:33,990
      you got it, you sick perv?

519
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:41,931
          (screaming)

520
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,139
           OH MY GOD!

521
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,776
  Hmm. Not so smart after all.

522
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:06,122
 - (Kylie): Poor Jimmy Stewart,
  with those two broken legs!

523
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:08,691
  - But he got the girl, so...

524
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,693
          - It is a pretty steep
                 price for love.

525
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:14,330
  - (in Jimmy Stewart voice):
     No price is too steep
       for love, Kylie.

526
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,466
     That was good, right,
         a good Jimmy?

527
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:19,702
  - (Kylie): What are the odds

528
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,572
  that we bump into each other
    like that the other day?

529
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:25,074
                     It's crazy!

530
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:28,244
- Well, maybe
it wasn't so random.

531
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:30,746
             - What do you mean?

532
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:33,950
- I um... I know.

533
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:38,387
...About<i> Girlhouse.</i>

534
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,994
                    - Oh, I see.
     You saw something you liked

535
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:47,196
        and you wanted to sample
                the merchandise.

536
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,866
- No, it's not like that at all.
I don't understand...

537
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:52,468
    - You don't understand.
        - Then help me.

538
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,438
       - I'm going to go.
           - Kylie...

539
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,708
I only brought it up 'cause I
don't want it to be an issue

540
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,644
moving forward.

541
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:04,247
           - Porn is not what it
               used to be, okay?

542
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:07,283
     It's totally different now.
   It's mainstream and accepted.

543
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,119
  I mean, think about Sasha Grey
               or Jenna Jameson.

544
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,522
There's no stigma. Nobody cares.
         - Yeah, but...

545
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:18,094
       ...shouldn't they?
        - I don't know.

546
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,897
- What about these other guys

547
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,933
that are coming to the house?

548
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:26,702
      - Fair. It's not required.

549
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:29,105
- Okay, but I assume

550
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:31,741
it's a big part of the job
sooner or later.

551
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,177
 - Not necessarily.<i> Girlhouse</i> is
  different. It's not like that.

552
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,380
           The guys that log in,

553
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,482
         it's not just for that.

554
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:41,484
                  They feel like
     they're getting to know us.

555
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:43,486
          They develop feelings,
        they fall in love, even.

556
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:46,956
- Come on, Kylie. They just
want to fuck you. That's all.

557
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,492
                - Well, I am not
              that type of girl.

558
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:51,494
- Yeah, that's what
I keep telling myself.

559
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:53,496
                - You know what,
               you have no right

560
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:56,265
              to judge me, okay?

561
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,001
           You have no idea what
    I'm going through right now.

562
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:01,971
                  I'm doing this
 so I don't have to quit school.

563
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:05,441
  My dad's gone and my mom needs
       all the help she can get.

564
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,311
    And you know what, the guys?

565
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:10,479
        That's the toughest part
                     about this.

566
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,848
 Okay? I'm hoping I can just get
    in there, make as much money

567
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,619
      as I can, and then get out
   before that becomes an issue.

568
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:24,994
       I've thought this through
                     completely.

569
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:29,565
              I really don't see
  how anything bad could happen.

570
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:33,402
          - I'm sorry.

571
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:40,176
        So... Is this, you know,
           going to be a problem

572
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:43,079
                 moving forward?

573
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:45,982
     - Not until you ask me
       to stay the night.

574
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:50,386
   I am extremely camera-shy.

575
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:49,545
      -<i> No idea, Loverboy. </i>

576
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,648
     <i> I'm kinda busy here.</i>

577
00:50:56,754 --> 00:51:00,990
     <i> Loverboy, I'm trying</i>
        <i> to do a show.</i>

578
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:10,099
   <i> Jesus! I said I don't know</i>
        <i> where she is.</i>

579
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,668
<i>You really are a pathetic freak.</i>

580
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:27,149
-<i> You were with him last night? </i>
  -<i> Yeah, I had sex with him </i>

581
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:30,119
<i>the other night and then I told</i>
   <i> you that he was small.</i>

582
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:33,956
  - Well, I mean, he's okay...

583
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,525
    - Well, you told me that
        he was small...

584
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,261
        - Who is that?
 - Oh, my God, look who it is!

585
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:43,032
     It's Loverboy... Yeah.
        - Oh, Loverboy!

586
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:45,401
Hey, Loverboy, I'm just curious.

587
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:48,537
    How did you come up with
    that handle, "Loverboy"?

588
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:52,441
       You must be quite
       the ladies' man.

589
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,543
Could have gone with "Loserboy".

590
00:51:56,681 --> 00:52:00,516
   (girl's laughter echoing)

591
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:02,518
          (laughing)
         - Definitely.

592
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,653
  - Janet! Janet! Come say hi
         to Loverboy.

593
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,490
     - Aww, poor Loverboy!

594
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:11,060
         Don't be mean.

595
00:52:11,062 --> 00:52:16,098
    - (Anna): Enough of him.
        I mean, anyways.

596
00:52:46,364 --> 00:52:51,000
          (screaming)

597
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:55,364
           - What...

598
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,347
      (car radio playing)

599
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:21,957
         (lock beeping)

600
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,467
      (muffled electronic
        music playing)

601
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:01,363
             (thud)

602
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:13,342
           (grunting)

603
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:17,012
     (banging door on head)
          (screaming)

604
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:42,104
       (muffled shouting)

605
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,009
      (muffled screaming)

606
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,481
       (inhaling deeply)

607
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:06,128
 - (Loverboy): Enjoy the show.

608
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:13,936
     - Come on, have dinner
        with me tonight.

609
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:15,938
We can drive back to Charlotte.

610
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,476
   We can go to this awesome
    barbeque place, you can
     meet my roommates...

611
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:23,312
    - How would I get back?

612
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:25,481
  - You could spend the night.

613
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:28,484
- I told you I have study group.

614
00:56:28,486 --> 00:56:31,487
  But I'll take a rain check.

615
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:34,990
Because meeting your roommate is
totally worth the 70-mile drive.

616
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:39,061
        (both laughing)
           - Funny.

617
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:02,518
  - Is this some kind of joke?

618
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:10,859
          Hey, buddy!

619
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:13,562
       Private property,
       you can't be here.

620
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:25,174
        Turn around now,
       before I make you.

621
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:27,976
       All right, well,
       you asked for it.

622
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:30,612
    Ahh! Fuck, that... Oof!

623
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,125
        (neck breaking)

624
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:02,010
           (beeping)

625
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:04,079
        (door unlocking)

626
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:11,553
    (muffled music playing)

627
00:58:11,555 --> 00:58:13,622
       (muffled moaning)

628
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,394
  - (Anna): Ooh, baby... Mm...

629
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:26,935
              ¶¶¶

630
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:37,145
          Oh, baby...

631
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:44,686
           (moaning)

632
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,755
         (door opening)

633
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:56,098
        Can I help you?

634
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,467
     (breathing ominously)

635
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:09,211
         Let me guess.
     You're here for Devon?

636
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:17,319
      No, wait... Heather.

637
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:20,989
   She likes that kinky shit.

638
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:28,163
        Well, run along.
      Her room's upstairs.

639
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,736
- Homie, you're really starting
     to piss me off, man.

640
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,806
      (frantic breathing)

641
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:42,277
        (weakly moaning)

642
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,783
           (choking)

643
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:58,260
        (choking stops)

644
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:20,248
 (inhaling and exhaling deeply)

645
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,954
             - Hi.
             - Hey.

646
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:39,067
      (rap music playing)

647
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:46,208
      -<i> All right, boys,</i>
<i>ready to have your minds blown?</i>

648
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:49,511
           (beeping)

649
01:00:54,518 --> 01:00:56,518
        <i> Only 3 of you?</i>

650
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,988
 <i> ...Or only 3 of you with your</i>
     <i> hands free to type?</i>

651
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:17,406
      - Yeah, screw this.
     I'm going one-on-one.

652
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:24,346
 - Sorry, fellas. Tugboat and I
       are going private.

653
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:29,885
      (soft music playing)

654
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,690
       - I'm going to go.
    Got a lot to do tonight.

655
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:38,493
   - Reading<i> War and Peace</i> or
    showing your lady parts
      to all of humanity?

656
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:42,230
          - Real cute.

657
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:03,919
         - What the...

658
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,927
             Okay.

659
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:23,505
         What the fuck?

660
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,193
 -<i> What are you talking about? </i>

661
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:52,467
- Maybe jerking off really does
       ruin your vision.

662
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:21,696
           Aw, shit!

663
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,376
 <i> What's your problem, Tugboat?</i>

664
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:42,484
 <i> Okay, is this a prank? Are you</i>
   <i> trying to freak me out?</i>

665
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,553
          <i> Not cool.</i>

666
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:58,366
     <i> Okay, you know what?</i>

667
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:00,368
     <i> If that's how you're</i>
         <i> going to be,</i>

668
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:03,772
<i>this session is over. Fuck you.</i>

669
01:04:03,774 --> 01:04:07,275
          (screaming)

670
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:11,213
      -<i> HELP ME! NO! AHH!</i>
          -<i> Shut up!</i>

671
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:14,049
            - Jesus!

672
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,588
 Dude, I need you to come here,
           right now.

673
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:24,559
       (Devon screaming)

674
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:29,397
       - Somebody help...
           (choking)

675
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:39,174
         - What is this, a joke?

676
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,380
               - Ahh, my face...

677
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,449
- What's that they say
about beauty?

678
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:51,086
   Something about skin deep?
          (screaming)

679
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:53,922
 - Is this real? Is this really
      happening right now,

680
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:55,924
    or is it, like, some gimmick
            to drive up traffic?

681
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:59,594
 - I don't know! They did some
    weird shit before, but
      nothing like this!

682
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,271
                   Nobody knows.

683
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:12,340
Call 911, now, right now! Do it!
             I gotta warn Kylie.

684
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:30,959
           (dialling)

685
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,966
        (phone buzzing)

686
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:50,612
             Shit!

687
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,055
        - What the fuck?
      - (dispatcher):<i> 911,</i>
    <i> what's your emergency?</i>

688
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:02,057
 - Hi, um, I don't really know
       how to explain...

689
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:04,059
     So I'm on this website
       called<i> Girlhouse.</i>

690
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:06,127
         - "Girlhouse"?
 - It's a pornographic website.

691
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,129
 -<i> Sir, I'm not following, this</i>
 <i> line is for emergencies only. </i>

692
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,131
- Look, I realize that, but I'm
   pretty sure I'm watching

693
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,000
 a girl being murdered online.

694
01:06:12,002 --> 01:06:15,036
        -<i> Where is she? </i>
     - I don't know! Um...

695
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:16,972
    -<i> Is she in Charlotte? </i>
   - I have no fucking clue!

696
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:19,040
     I'm pretty sure she's
    somewhere in the state.

697
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:22,010
-<i> Well, if you don't know where</i>
   <i> she is, how am I supposed</i>
        <i> to help her? </i>

698
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:24,946
          <i> Sir? Sir?</i>

699
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:28,616
    - That's it. That's it.
           (sobbing)

700
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,190
        - (Devon): Why?

701
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:39,728
   - He's putting on a show.
 - I can't get a hold of Kylie.

702
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:43,665
    Did you call the cops?
   - They can't do anything.

703
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,667
     - What do you mean--
     - We don't know where

704
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:49,671
     the house is. It could
   be fucking anywhere, man.
Did Kylie ever tell you? Dude...

705
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:57,812
         - No, no, NO!
      DON'T, DON'T, DON'T!

706
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:00,949
       (screaming loudly)

707
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:11,426
            - Ugh...

708
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:13,595
       - This is insane.
     Dude, there has to be

709
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:15,797
     some way to find them.
 - From a live video broadcast?

710
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:18,333
- What about the website, okay?
It has to be registered, or...

711
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:20,735
-<i> Girlhouse</i> prides itself on its
impenetrability, man. Trust me.

712
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:22,904
      I've snooped around.
           - Well...

713
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:26,074
         Okay, we know
  they're in Carolina, right?
 Kylie goes to Selby in Milton,

714
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:28,710
 so it can't be far from there.
 - That really narrows it down.

715
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:41,790
  - Fucking call the cops again,
     man! Do something! See what

716
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:43,825
   they have on the website, all
        right? Business records,

717
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:47,162
licences, tax receipts,
anything. And then I need
you to hop onto that computer

718
01:07:47,164 --> 01:07:49,831
   and work your magic. You're a
friggin' CompSci major, dig into

719
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:51,900
   your bag of wizardry and then
   hack the fuck into that site.

720
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:54,335
- Well what are you going to do?
  - I'm gonna drive to Milton.

721
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:57,238
Hopefully you'll have an address
for me by the time I get there.
         - That'll take

722
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,240
      an hour and a half!
 - I'll be there in 45 minutes.

723
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,810
Don't let me down, okay?
Kylie's life may depend on this.

724
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:05,280
     - No pressure, right?

725
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:10,919
         (whimpering)
     - I'm so... Please...

726
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:19,194
            - MOM...

727
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,698
           (sobbing)

728
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,771
            - Oof..

729
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:37,212
 (inhaling and exhaling deeply)

730
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,751
            - Damn!
          - Close one.

731
01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:02,137
- (man on TV):<i> Are you married?</i>
          <i> Happily?</i>

732
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:04,572
   - (woman):<i> Who is happily</i>
      <i> married nowadays? </i>

733
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:07,942

01:09:10,013 --> 01:09:12,814
- Come on, you buy this crap?

736
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:14,816
    - It's called love, dumbass.

737
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:18,653
  Believe it or not, some people
                still want that.

738
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:21,589
- Please, there are far too many
     distractions nowadays.

739
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:26,060
 Porn sites, the dating sites,

740
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:28,830
       cheating sites...

741
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,232
  You really think if this guy
         had<i> Girlhouse </i>

742
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:34,569
   he'd have acted this way?

743
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:37,872
 He'd be too busy watching you.

744
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:47,815
             - Okay, 20 minutes,
               then we can fuck.

745
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:50,418
                        Stop it.

01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,755
                Stop it, I wanna
                watch the movie.

747
01:09:53,757 --> 01:10:00,895

is too long.

748
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:13,575

         (both moaning)

01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:34,896
- (Bret): Bro, are you serious?

754
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:38,700
    You wanna watch, log on
      like everyone else.

755
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:44,305
      (Heather screaming)

756

      Take it easy, guys.

761
01:11:34,024 --> 01:11:37,158
      Fuck! That's enough.

762
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,600
                   - No, no, no!

763
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:48,536
      Don't go in there,
don't go in there, turn around!

764
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:51,606
 (muffled moaning and panting)

       (hyperventilating)

773
01:13:18,661 --> 01:13:22,797
- Okay, I think that's enough
for me. I'm gonna rinse off

774
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:26,234
and head upstairs before I pass
     out. You wanna come?

775
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:28,369
                  - In a minute.

776
