Great meeting last night.

524
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,297
Very comforting to the parents.

525
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,342
- Listen, are you alone?
- Yes.

526
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,428
Good, because I got something
I wanna show you.

527
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,529
I'm faxing to you now.

528
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,957
Are you looking at it?
Tell me that's not her.

529
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,962
- Who?
- Loralee Sherman. Tell me that's not her?

530
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,090
Oh, jeez Brent, you are cracking up.

531
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,301
A few years ago,
I thought about contacting her.

532
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,977
I traced her to West Virginia.

533
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,771
About two hours from here.
This time I'm going out there.

534
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,188
Listen, Brent... Nobody has seen
or heard of her for over 25 years.

535
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,400
Now why the hell would she be showing up
now as some sort of psycho killer?

536
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,281
Put the phone down, I'll call you back.

537
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,868
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

538
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,871
Were you listening to me?
What did you hear?

539
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,663
No, I didn't hear anything. I just
picked up the phone to call Mom.

540
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,500
I couldn't figure out how
to get a line out, that's all.

541
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,723
Sorry, honey.
This case, I guess it's, uh...

542
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,938
guess it's really getting to me.

543
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,891
I'm sorry, baby,
it's not your fault, honey.

544
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,692
It's not your fault.

545
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,377
- Hi, Sheriff Marken.
- Hello, Sandy.

546
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,540
Oh, my God, Jody. Are you okay?
Everybody's been asking about you.

547
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,416
Sheriff! Rolly, prisoner wants
to make a full confession.

548
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,919
I hope it's faster than
last week's confession.

- What?

the whole entire school.

has this thing for virgins.

552
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:14,726

off endangered species list. And have sex.

You ready to come home?

- I was gonna go to school with Sandy.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

When I was in high school...

696
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,704
there was a girl named Loralee Sherman...

697
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,915
that claimed she was raped by...

Was there any evidence?

703
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,895
- Did she identify them?
- Yeah.

704
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,602
Then why weren't they charged?

705
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:12,152
Because they were from good families,
stars of the football team.

706
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:16,194
That kind of thing. And she was just
this loner that nobody cared for.

707
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,951
She just thought she was
smarter than everybody.

708

held up in court.

would have held up now.

then he told them what happened?

He couldn't do that.

on the side of the road.
