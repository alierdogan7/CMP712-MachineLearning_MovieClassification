00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,520
Mr. Falk? James Sandin.
I talked to John over at repairs...

2
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,040
and he took care of it.
It's all fine

3
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,980
The system is working without a hitch,
you're going to be locked in tight tonight.

4
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,170
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, Mr. Falk, safe night.

5
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,900
<i>- James Sandin's Office.</i>
- Sue, I took care of Falk.

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,220
What do you know?
You hear anything?

7
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,240
You're number one, Mr. Sandin.
You got it, sir.

8
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,370
- You come out on top.
- Thank you very much. </ I>

9
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,290
Thank you.

10
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,320
- Congratulations to you too, Susan.
- You don't have to say that.

11
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,340
No, Susan, it's a team win.

12
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,370
Thank you.

13
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,970
- Okay, safe night.
- Safe night, Mr. Sandin.

Mr. Cali!

25
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,570
- Getting in one last walk in before lockdown?
- Yes.

26
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,590
Did you do the systems check
I recommended?

27
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,100
- Of course, there are no problems.
- OK, it's the same one I use.

28
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,620
I only sale the best.

29
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,140
Nobodies bothering us tonight.

30
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,670
Well, you have a safe night,
Mr. Sandin.

31
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,490

Wife: I'm in the kitchen.

38
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,520
What a day! What a day. Everybody
is doing security checks. It's crazy.

39
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,540
Traffic is even worst than last year

40
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,570
Something smells good.

41
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
Great!

42
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,640
I'll put them in the water,
they look dry.

43
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,240
- Where are the kids?
- In their room, of course.

44
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,270
- We got about an hour before commencement.
- Dinner isn't going to be ready for a while...

45
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,290
OK, good.

46
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,900
Well, I have to make a few phone calls.

47
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,750
- One thing.
- Yeah.

48
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,450
Zoey's is getting worse.
She has been pouting all day.

49
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,890
So, you're gonna have to do something
about the Henry situation. I can't stand it.

50
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,090
There's nothing to do with her. He is 18,
he's not getting any younger

51
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,700
She is going to have to sulk,
get over it

52
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,350
But I have some good news for all of us.
I'll tell you at dinner.

53
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,370
<i>History has proven over and over again.
We are a inherently violent species, </i>

54
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,100
<i>Wars, genocide, murders, the denial of our
true selfs is the real problem. </i>

55
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,540
<i>The Purge not only contains societal
violence to a single evening.</i>

56
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,970
<i>But the countrywide catharsis
creates a  psychological stability...</i>

57
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,170
<i>by letting us release the aggression
we all have inside of us.</i>

58
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,870
I love you.

59
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,320
- Let's growl.
- What?

60
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,350
- Growl.
- Why?

61
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,370
Because, everyone says
I love you and it's used...

62
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,900
and we need to find our own thing.

63
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,340
- No! I'll look silly.
- Come on.

64
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,550
- No.
- Do it. It's our way of saying " I love you".

65
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,850
Try it.
Seriously.

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,020
I think my dad's home.

67
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,540
I'm sorry, baby,
but you have to get going.

68
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,650
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,670
And you have to get home
before lockdown.

70
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,700
Come on.

71
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,850
[Growls]
- Really?

72
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,100
Someone is getting ready for tonight.

73
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,850
Be careful.

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,600
Mary!

75
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,620
I'm so glad I caught you.

76
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,070
I come bearing gifts.

77
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,590
What have I done to deserve
a gift, Grace?

78
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,500
I was baking and I made way too many cookies.
Hi Grace!

79
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,640
- Hi!
- Ohhh cookies! I hope you're hungry.

80
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,670
Those cookies are crazy good.

81
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,690
They're lovely.

82
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,720
To have a safe night,
ladies.

83
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,740
- Bye!
- Goodbye!

84
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,770
Thank you, Grace.

85
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,370
Just as I needed more cookies, right?

86
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,520
The new edition to your house.

87
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,540
It's just amazing.

88
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,150
- Thank you.
- You know not everyone is happy you build it, Mary.

89
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,850
Whatcha you mean?

90
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,290
You know your husband sold a new
security system

91
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,320
to almost every home in this community.

92
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,920
Some people are actually saying that...

93
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,370
this neighborhood paid for...
that new edition on your home.

94
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,390
Are people really saying that?

95
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
Relax, it's just some good ole
neighbor gossip. Don't worry about it.

96
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,020
You're too sensitive.

97
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,020
So, are you having your
annual party, Grace?

98
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,020
No, too much trouble. We just going to
lockdown, and watch some Purge event special...

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,020
Thanks for the cookies.

100
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,040
Goodnight.

101
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,650
You're welcome.

102
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,670
- Have a safe night, Mary.
- And you, Grace.

103
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,390
Jesus.

104
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,000
You scared me to death.

105
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,000
You can't keep creeping up
on me like that, Charlie.

106
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,100
So, quit playing with Timmy,
and help me set the table.

Now.</i>

109
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,100
Charlie, that's twice today.
You're gonna give me a heart attack?

110
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,540
I'm sorry, Mom.
Check it out. I made some adjustments, look!

111
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,570
I installed a night vision program...

112
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,090
and I insulated this motor so
you can now barely hear him.

113
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,720
And you can now play music to
accompany him on his missions.

It's tonight, isn't it?

Just remember all the good
the Purge does, OK?

It's all that matters.

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,870
- A little bit.
- Good. Tell you what, take Timmy away...

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,390
and come help me finish up.

125
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,000
- OK?
- OK.

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,070
Sorry, I forgot to take
my vitals earlier.

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,020
By the way, there is a slight deviation
in the heart rate.

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,070
- nothing to worry about.
- Okay, thank you.

136
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,670
Zoey, your day.

137
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,700
I don't want to do this anymore.
It's stupid.

138
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,140
Great! Fine. Pop test, piano,
a normal day.

- Who cares?
- I do. I care, very much.

140

And what about practice?
Are you ready for your recital?

141

Of course you are, because you're

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,870
I did it.

Thank you. It was a team effort,
you know.

All right, Charlie. You're next.

152
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,990
Well, we studied history
of tonight in History.

153
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,520
And in English I wrote a story about
a man whose love was so powerful,

154
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,540
that it can kill people.
Cuts out his own heart.

That is so sweet.

- Zoey!
- We're eating dinner!

Zoey, that's not funny...

159
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,250
- Don't encourage her.
- We're trying to eat.

Well, it's later than I thought.

Alright, it's time to lockdown.
Let's go.

Just thank God we weren't invited.

you would kill someone too?

Okay, and ...

224
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,720
Yes! If your mother and I were so inclined
we would participate.

225

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,570
Henry!

345
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,100
OK.

346
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,540
Here's the plan.

347
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,150
You two stay put here
and I'll just...

348
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,590
I'll go out there,
and I'm going to find Zoey...

349
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,620
and I'm going to bring her back here.

350
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,640
- Henry tried to kill you.
- Mary...

351
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,670
I've got to make sure she's OK.

352
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,690
Okay? I have too.

353
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,320
He didn't shoot me.

354
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,740
I'll find her.

355
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,450
- I'll go.
- I can't let you go...

356
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,770
with that man out there.

357
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,790
OK, I can't let you do that.

358
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,820
Let me go get her.

359
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,840
You just stay here with Charlie.

360
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,250
- OK?
- You be careful, okay?

361
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,350
I will.

362
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,350
Zoey!

363
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,290
Zoey!

364
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,400
Zoey! Listen to me!

365
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,520
You okay, sweetheart?

366
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,120
Yeah.

367
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,300
[Zoey calling outside]

368
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,100
Charlie! Mom!

369
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,120
Charlie you wait here, I will be right on
the other side of the door.

370
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,150
Baby!
Zoey!

371
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,600
[Machine gun fire down the street]

372
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,770
Mom?

373
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,790
Zoey.

374
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,820
Are you okay? Is Charlie OK?

375
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,840
- Father all right?
- Everyone is fine.

376
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,870
I didn't know Henry
was going to do that.

377
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,890
I didn't know that he wanted
to kill him.

378
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,920
- Why would he do that?
- Mom?

379
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,940
Charlie, give me a second....

380
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,970
He's died.

381
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,990
Mom?

382
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,020
Charlie, give me a second.

383
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,620
- Zoey, let's see what Charlie wants.
- Mom, now!

384
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,520
What is it, baby?

385
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,540
- You wanna see this.
- Tell Dad that I'm sorry.

386
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,150
Zoey!

387
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,850
Zoey!

388
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,770
Henry is dead.

389
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,990
I killed him.

390
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,020
I know, I saw Zoey.

391
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,040
- Is she OK? She alright?
- She's not hurt.

392
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,650
I couldn't get her to come with me.

393
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,100
What are we going to do?

394
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,270
I have to show you something.

395
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,870
Oh, god.

396
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,100
Now that one is saying something.

397
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,120
Good evening, Mr. Sandin.

398
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,150
Your home tells me that you are
good folks, just like us.

399
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,470
One of the haves.

400
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,590
And the blue flowers tell me
that you support the Purge.

401
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,200
We willing to treat you fairly,
so, listen closely.

402
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Let me introduce us!
We are some fine, loyal, very educated,

403
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,250
guys and gals.

404
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,270
We have gotten gussied up these terrifying disguises...

405
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,300
as we do every year...

406
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,270
ready to violate,

407
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,870
and annihilate,
to cleanse our souls.

408
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,900
But things took a turn.

409
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,920
Our target escaped us, and...

410
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,500
So, one of your good neighbors
informed us that you...

411
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,940
the Sandin's...

412
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:24,550
have inexplicably given him sanctuary.

413
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,570
The man you shelter is nothing
but a dirty, homeless pig.

414
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,520
A good testimony of a just society who
has audacity to fight back.

415
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,120
Killing one of us as
we attempted to execute him tonight.

416
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,570
The pig doesn't know his place,

417
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,590
and now he needs to
be taught a lesson.

418
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,200
We need you to return him to us.

419
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,220
Alive.

420
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,250
So that we may Purge
as we are entitled.

421
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,350
Here's the plan, Sandins!

422
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,600
You have to provide us with permission
to break into your home.

423
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,270
If you don't...

424
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,870
If you don't, we're going to come in
and release the beast on him

425
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,320
And on you.

426
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,340
And ah...

427
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,950
We can enter any home we want.

428
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,390
And we will want...

429
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,000
As long as we want
on this fine night.

430
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,850
Don't force us to hurt you.

431
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,870
We don't want to hurt one
of our own.

432
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,500
Please, just let us Purge!

433
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,520
Toodaloo, Sandins.

434
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,100
Cut it, cut it now!

435
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,500
C'mon, let's work on the back-up.

436
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,520
The powers down
over the whole house.

437
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,550
They can't get here, right?
They can't get into our house.

438
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,990
I don't know, it's hard to say.

439
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,600
You don't know?

440
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,040
You sell these security systems.
What do you mean you don't know?

441
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,070
We have tested the system.
It works 99% of the time.

442
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,090
It looks good. It's strong,
it keeps people away.

443
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,120
It looks good.

444
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,140
It's not built for
worst case scenarios.

445
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,570
It is impenetrable?

446
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,270
No, nothing is impenetrable.

447
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,800
Things like this are not suppose to
happen in our neighborhood.

448
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,820
But they are happening, James.

449
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,850
They're happening right now.
Do you see this?

450
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,870
Listen, sit down, just sit down.
Please, we've got to calm down.

451
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,020
Okay, sit down, sit down, listen.

452
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,440
To answer your question,

453
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,570
Yes, they could get into here.

454
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,090
OK, they could tunnel underneath us.

455
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,120
They could smoke us out.

456
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,140
Improvise a battering ram.

457
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,170
OK, I'm sorry, but it's true.

458
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,770
So, here's what we're going do.

459
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,240
We'll gonna give them
what they want.

460
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,850
We'll find that man

461
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,870
And we're gonna force him outside.

462
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,900
Now...

463
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,340
we have guns...

464
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,370
And he doesn't.

465
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,970
But they'll kill him.

466
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Why should he die?

467
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,020
It's either him or us, Charlie.

468
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:31,500
[Girls outside taunting, shooting guns]
I bet the boys won't let us go inside.

469
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:39,500
Not killing anyone wouldn't be any fun, please!

470
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,100
Fuck!

471
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,850
Where is he?

472
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,100
There he is.

473
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,850
Look at me.

474
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,870
Come on,
look over here.

475
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,600
Where are you?

476
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,620
Come on!

477
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,100
Polite Leader:
<i>Hey, Mr. Sandin!</i>

478
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,120
<i>Sorry to interrupt,
but I must have a word.</i>

479
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,150
<i>Anybody at the front door?
I just need a moment of your time.</i>

480
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,150
[Knocks on door]

481
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,650
There you are.

482
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,370
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

483
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,100
Tell me, why haven't you delivered
the filthy swine yet?

484
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,120
Are you protecting him?

485
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,870
I certainly hope not, Mr. Sandin.

486
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,170
No, of course not.

487
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,200
I just can't find him.

488
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,990
You see, this is a misunderstanding.

489
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,020
My son let him in, he's a young boy
who doesn't know better.

490
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,440
But I support what occurs
here tonight, 100%.

491
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,070
OK? I sell security equipment.

492
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:41,090
So, I would never deny yours
or anybodies else's right to Purge.

493
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,120
You see...

494
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,720
Give us the homeless pig,
you fuck...

495
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,520
Sorry about that.

496
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,540
I don't condone that
kind of behavior.

497
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,150
Just keep in mind, Mr. Sandin...

498
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,590
he was my friend, and you...

499
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,200
...are not.

500
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,220
Our equipment is arriving soon.

501
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,250
And we will get him.

502
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,270
Soon after that...

503
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,300
we will need him.

504
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,850
- I'll go get him.
- You should do that.

505
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,350
Hey, Charlie.

506
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,370
I don't know what going on here.

507
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,400
There are people outside.

508
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,850
Henry is dead.

509
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,870
I'll be OK, I have his gun.

510
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,720
Stay where you are.

511
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,320
Please be safe, okay?

512
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,770
I'm gonna go hide
in your secret spot.

513
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,790
No.

514
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,400
I love you.

515
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,420
Don't.

516
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,520
Zoey?

517
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,550
Get back.

518
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,490
Into the hall. Let's go.

519
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,100
Drop your gun.

520
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,100
Dad, please.

521
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,850
Drop it.

522
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,870
<i>Don't hurt her. </i>

523
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,020
Zoey, I will not let him hurt you.

524
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,040
Leave her alone.

525
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,070
No, you son-of-a-bitch. I will let her go
when this night is over.

526
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,090
You're gonna get us all killed,
you know that

527
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,120
They're going to come in here,
and they are gonna kill us all.

528
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
They are coming here!

529
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,170
You have got to leave my family
out of this, OK?

530
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,190
If you don't drop your gun,
I will hurt her.

531
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,220
- and I will hurt you.
- We didn't do anything to you.

532
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,820
- I don't deserve this.
- I don't deserve this, either.

533
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,850
Now listen, I don't want
to hurt any of you.

534
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,870
But I am "NOT" dying tonight!

535
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,900
Drop the gun, please.
Drop it.

536
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,340
Please.

537
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,440
Listen to me, okay?

538
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,770
You are going to die tonight.

539
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,790
And you can either you die like a man and
walk outside there by yourself...

540
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,820
or you can die like a coward,

541
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,840
And get my wife and my children
killed along with you.

542
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,990
OK? So, take that gun away from
my daughter's head.

543
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,600
Shoot it, Mary!
Shoot it!

544
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,270
Oh, shit.

545
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,920
Mary! Mary! Zoey!

546
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,520
She's unconscious.

547
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,370
Okay.
Okay.

548
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,790
- We gonna need some rope.
- What?

549
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,420
Mary, we have to get some rope,

550
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,440
and we have to tie him up,

551
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,470
and get him outside.

552
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,070
And we're gonna end
this goddamn night.

553
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,020
Alright? Do you hear me?

554
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,240
OK.

555
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,570
Alright Charlie,
c'mon, help me.

556
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,170
Sweetheart?

557
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,000
Sweetheart.

558
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,920
I'm almost done here.
As soon as we get the legs secured.

559
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,940
Let me see.

560
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,970
You're doing great.

561
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,990
Here's what we're gonna do.

562
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,020
I'm gonna roll him into that chair
and drag him outside.

563
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,490
Okay? You got it?
You ready?

564
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,020
Charlie, concentrate
on your sister, OK?

565
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,740
In case she wakes up.

566
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,570
Charlie, I need the light.

567
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,170
Thank you, son.
Alright, okay.

568
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,520
Good job. You're doing great.

569
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,540
Alright, great. I'm gonna get the chair here.

570
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,250
Okay? We are almost done.

571
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,590
I'm gonna pick him up on the count of three.
You can help...

572
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,720
Keep the light on us, Charlie.

573
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,740
OK, one, two...

574
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,300
Three!

575
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,320
OK. Alright, get the tape
and tape him in there.

576
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,350
Hey, hey, hey! Quiet down, quiet down!
I got it. I got it, OK!

577
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,600
Alright, alright! You gotta calm down!
He's gonna break the tape!

578
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,040
- Cut his wound.
- What?

579
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,650
Get the letter opener and open his wound!

580
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,670
Get the letter opener,
I said!

581
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,920
- Grab the letter opener!
- No! Mom!

582
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,520
I'm just trying to protect my family.

583
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,100
Calm down!

584
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,040
- Mom!
- Come on, Mary, do it!

585
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,990
Do it, Mary! Do it!
Right on his wound!

586
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,020
Yes, yes.

587
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,040
Want to do it again?

588
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,070
Mom!
Stop!

589
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,090
Do it!

590
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,700
Alright, alright!

591
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,500
Cut!
Cut!

592
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,520
You gonna sit in the chair?

593
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,520
Now he's ready,
help me up, help me up!

594
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,570
Alright, alright.

595
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,170
OK, OK,
I got it.

596
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,020
Stay right there, alright?
Stop it.

597
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,040
Just let me tape you
to this chair, alright?

598
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:31,650
Mary, where's the tape?

599
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,890
You are making it much more difficult...

600
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,120
than it needs to be.

601
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,140
Do you understand me?

602
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,750
Alright,
alright.

603
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,350
Look at this! Look at this man!
Look at what we're doing to him.

604
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,350
Come on Mary,
let's get this over with.

605
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,000
Come on, Mary!

606
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,770
- Look at me!
- I can't.

607
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,790
Yes, you can, baby.
Baby, I need you right now.

608
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,520
OK. Hey! Look at me! Huh...

609
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,420
Mary!
Mary?

610
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,520
We don't have no other choice.

611
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,140
This is so wrong.

612
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,570
Baby!

613
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,590
- This is so wrong.
- We don't have no other choice.

614
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,890
Don't touch me.
OK, look at you!

615
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,920
No, no.

616
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,000
Don't touch me.

617
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:48,150
When did this happen?

618
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,350
James, look at you.

619
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,370
What the hell happened
with us, James?

620
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,400
Charlie!

621
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,850
Charlie!
Baby, where did you go?

622
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,870
Charlie!

623
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,020
Charlie!

624
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,290
Charlie, where... ?

625
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,900
Charlie!

626
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,850
Zoey.

627
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,870
Hey, are you alright?

628
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,600
Sit down, sit down. You hit your head.
Are you okay?

629
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,620
Good!

630
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,670
I'm so sorry about Henry.

631
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,390
Okay?

632
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,520
I'm so sorry.

633
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,140
But we're going to make it through tonight

634
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,170
We will and ...

635
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,770
everything is going to be OK.

636
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,220
No, it...

637
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,820
What?

638
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Look at what you doing.

639
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,520
Nothing, is ever going to be OK again.

640
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,100
Don't say that.
Don't say that.

641
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,850
Save your children.

642
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,870
Take me outside.

643
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,600
Charlie!
Charlie!

644
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,600
[Car horns honking outside]

645
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,850
I want all these barricades down!

646
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:20,870
Polite Leader: Get everybody to cover
every door and every window.

647
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,520
James, where's Zoey?

648
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,140
I don't know, she ran out here.

649
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,570
The street thugs outside are coming in.

650
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,590
They've got chains on the door
and the windows.

651
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,620
They're going to pull them,
and come inside.

652
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,220
- Baby you were right.
- No, I wasn't right about anything.

653
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,250
You know what, they're right outside.

654
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,690
I have another idea.

655
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,300
What are you gonna do?

656
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,650
Charlie! Charlie...

657
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,770
listen to me! Listen to me.

658
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,290
You take this gun, alright?

659
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,820
You want me to go outside?

660
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,840
No.

661
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,870
You gonna go and hide in the basement and
you'll not come out for anybody, alright?

662
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,890
-OK.
- You got that? You're a good boy.

663
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,520
Alright!
Go! Go!

664
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,520
You just gave our son a gun.
What the hell are we doing?

665
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,550
We're gonna fight.

666
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,740
Why don't you take this one as well.
The safety is off.

667
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,480
- We have a lot of rounds.
- What do I do?

668
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,770
You will cover the other
side of the house.

669
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:19,370
This is our home,
our kids live here,

670
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:23,570
If anyone tries to come in, you blast him,
you will not hesitate.

671
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,400
Polite Leader:
Hey, Mr. Sandin!

672
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:33,420
I'm sorry to tell you,
but your time is essentially up.

673
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,870
And you failed!

674
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:40,470
You failed to deliver
the homeless swine.

675
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,920
I am very disappointed that you fine folks,

676
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,940
should know better, 
that piece of filth,

677
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:50,970
that you are protecting,

678
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,570
exists only to serve our need to Purge!

679
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,600
So, I bid thee sweet farewell, Mr Sandin.

680
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,040
Release the beast, boys...

681
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,650
let the purge commence!

682
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,350
Go!

683
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,020
Are you okay?

684
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,040
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

685
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:44,070
No, I'm OK!

686
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,670
Charlie: Let's go!
James: C'mon, c'mon

687
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,020
Cooper!

688
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,420
Come look for the little lady Sadin.

689
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:41,650
Jesus...

690
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:44,670
Send her to me.

691
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,120
Dad!

692
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,140
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

693
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,670
Okay.

694
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,770
- Mom and Zoey, OK?
- Yeah, they're gonna be fine.

695
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,990
It's okay.

696
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,020
Your soul has been cleansed,
Mr. Sandin.

697
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,620
You've purged.

698
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,520
