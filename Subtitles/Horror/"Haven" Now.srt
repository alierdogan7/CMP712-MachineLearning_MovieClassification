00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,629
(Audrey) Previously on<i> Haven...</i>

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,413
- Hello, Dove.
- Croatoan.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:06,539
Not "Dad"?

4
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,389
Clearly we have a lot of catching up to do.

5
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:11,309
What they did to you, turning you
into the Barn's controller...

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,977
Could you do it to me?

7
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,646
Vince! What have you done?

8
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,256
What I had to.

9
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:19,768
(Audrey) It's a Holloway trouble,

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,054
where a building merges with a person.

11
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:23,222
[phone rings]

12
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,223
Are you trying to talk to me?

13
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,785
It's Laverne.

14
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,894
Who am I talking to right now? Duke?

15
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,112
No.

16
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,948
This is what I am.

17
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,283
Croatoan's inside your head.

18
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,701
You can force him out.

19
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,878
Don't let him control you.

20
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,067
Daddy?

21
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,244
I need to teach you a lesson.

22
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,012
[crack] [screams]

23
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:50,916
You can control the Troubles
that you take from people?

24
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,002
They're gifts, and in the right hands,

25
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:54,303
they can accomplish anything.

26
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,071
I created you.

27
00:00:58,176 --> 00:01:01,143
All the times that you
asked me to kill for you,

28
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:04,430
look what I have become,
what you turned me into.

29
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,489
I got snacks from the vending machine.

30
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,741
Please tell me you got the P3 unstuck,

31
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,193
and that's a Baby Ruth in your hand.

32
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:18,744
[groans]

33
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,615
- Sorry.
- Ah.

34
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:23,949
Granola.

35
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,618
Laverne controls the vending machine now.

36
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,745
She only dispenses the healthy stuff.

37
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:30,256
A little healthy wouldn't hurt.

38
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,543
How you holding up?

39
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:35,961
You must be exhausted.

40
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,264
Croatoan locked me in a child's room

41
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:43,352
and said he was going to help
my friends, make them happy.

42
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,888
It was scarier than a flat-out threat.

43
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,325
Sounds terrifying.

44
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:49,525
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,644
He was different than I expected.

46
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,362
So much hurt.

47
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,561
He really thinks that he's
doing the right thing.

48
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,399
By getting you to help him trouble people.

49
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,034
It's more than that.

50
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,153
He's a father that wants his daughter back.

51
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,539
But you are not his daughter.

52
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,458
Mara was. She's dead.

53
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,130
But when he looks at me, he sees her.

54
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,753
Which is why we need to
get this thing fixed,

55
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:21,223
get that Barn built, send that
monster back to the Void.

56
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,478
Has Vince come up with anything yet?

57
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:25,960
No, not yet.

58
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,930
Dwight's working on it with him.

59
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:30,075
He's got him stashed away just in case...

60
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,268
In case Duke comes after him.

61
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,486
Has anybody seen him since
he took the census?

62
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,688
No.

63
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,106
If Croatoan gets those Troubles,

64
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:38,274
he's going to use them against us.

65
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:40,555
He is not gonna get the chance.

66
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,195
We're gonna get Duke back.

67
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,367
[dramatic music]

68
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,970
[metallic clatter]

69
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:14,143
[breathing heavily]

70
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,366
Victor Kirby.

71
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,904
I knew your aunt.

72
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,330
She could see the future too.

73
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,392
Anyone she touched...

74
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:35,454
Vanessa knew exactly how
they were going to die.

75
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,036
What do you want?

76
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,543
Your trouble.

77
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:41,086
But why?

78
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,574
It's horrible.

79
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,307
Not for Croatoan.

80
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:48,260
He can turn it into a power,

81
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,397
use it to show his daughter

82
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,817
how amazing the future can be

83
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,319
if she joins him.

84
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,338
Please don't.

85
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,276
You look so worried, Kirby.

86
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:07,079
But don't you know what's going to happen?

87
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,949
Haven't you seen how you're
going to meet your end?

88
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,534
I've tried,

89
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:16,038
but I can only see how
other people die, not me.

90
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,416
If you had seen it,

91
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:22,044
it would've looked a lot like this.

92
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,796
[groans]

93
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,302
I know how it ends for you, Crocker.

94
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,633
I can see it.

95
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,610
Just like Vanessa did.

96
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,536
I'm not that man anymore.

97
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:22,941
<font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix
www.addic7ed.com</font>

98
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:28,524
Vince says there's nothing
in his new programming

99
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:30,025
to fix the Aether core.

100
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:32,561
I was afraid of that.
How's he doing otherwise?

101
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:34,029
He says he feels mostly the same,

102
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,397
but it's gotta be weird.

103
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,828
Being turned into an
otherworldly crystal, yeah.

104
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:41,987
I'd feel better if I at least
knew where you hid it.

105
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,375
You can trust me, Nathan.

106
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,745
Of course I can.

107
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:50,663
You keep working with Vince.

108
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,548
We'll try to and figure out a
way to fix the core on our end.

109
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,551
I'll call you if we manage
to come up with something.

110
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:02,381
Why don't you want to
tell them about Lizzie?

111
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,927
Because you're afraid they'll take her?

112
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,890
I need to know what she is.

113
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:09,431
An Aether creature maybe...

114
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,120
Like the ones William made?

115
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,550
Or a product of a trouble?

116
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:16,021
A resurrection trouble.

117
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:18,824
You don't think she could
actually be Lizzie?

118
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:21,243
No. My daughter's dead.

119
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,419
It's Duke. He's out there.

120
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:34,006
(Lizzie) Daddy, what's wrong?

121
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:35,708
Nothing, honey. Everything's fine.

122
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,543
Why is he just standing there?

123
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,211
What's he waiting for?

124
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:40,929
Okay, I want you to take
Lizzie to the back stairs.

125
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,848
If Duke comes in, I want you to both run.

126
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,133
But what about you?

127
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:45,384
I'll buy you some time.

128
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:46,385
Couple of minutes.

129
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:47,770
You can't confront him.

130
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:49,971
I can't let him get a hold of you.

131
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:52,524
He might be here for Lizzie.

132
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:54,193
Please.

133
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:10,376
Lizzie, I need you to go
with Uncle Vince, okay?

134
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,533
No, I want to stay here with you.

135
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:16,904
Honey, it's a game.

136
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:18,405
You and Vince go hide

137
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:20,324
and see how long it takes
for me to find you.

138
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,159
Oh, I love hide and seek.

139
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:24,495
Okay, you count down from
100, and we'll hide.

140
00:07:24,497 --> 00:07:26,964
Come on. I know a good hiding spot.

141
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:36,890
100, 99...

142
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,066
98...

143
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,545
97...

144
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,770
Oh, he was stabbed in the chest.

145
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:51,522
It looks like Duke's work, all right.

146
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:55,047
Poor Victor. He didn't stand a chance.

147
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:56,994
Anyway, I gotta go.

148
00:07:56,996 --> 00:07:58,946
Intern's watching baby Aaron,

149
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:01,164
and she keeps giving him apple juice.

150
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,001
You think Croatoan's tough,
try an infant on a sugar high.

151
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:08,672
Vickie.

152
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,377
Vickie still has her sketching trouble.

153
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,882
So maybe if she can draw the Aether core,

154
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:19,349
she can put it back together.

155
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,852
- She can make it whole again.
- It's worth a shot.

156
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:23,631
I'll have her meet us at the station.

157
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,141
Croatoan.

158
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:45,489
You must be Nathan.

159
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:47,711
An "ask questions later" kind of guy.

160
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:49,580
- I like you already.
- You bastard...

161
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:53,083
Nathan, the Troubles he holds...
We can't hurt him.

162
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:55,586
Smart, pragmatic.

163
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:56,920
That's my girl.

164
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:58,589
And right as usual.

165
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:03,427
Strike me, and your
internal organs liquefy.

166
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:05,762
A trouble I gathered from your census.

167
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:09,349
Why did Duke kill Kirby?
To take his trouble?

168
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:12,569
Collecting Troubles was
what I designed him to do.

169
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,439
So you could take them with
you, use them for your revenge?

170
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:17,274
No, you're going to design those Troubles.

171
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:20,777
Oh, these are for my personal use.

172
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:22,079
So what, you're just here

173
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,780
to make sure Duke stays on schedule?

174
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:25,575
No, no, Duke's fine.

175
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,906
I'm here to talk to you, Nathan.

176
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,719
You're a lucky man.

177
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:36,677
From my conversations with my daughter,

178
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,428
I can tell she loves you very much.

179
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,013
And she'll do anything to make you happy.

180
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:42,902
And that's very hard to find.

181
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,802
Leave Nathan alone.

182
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:49,168
As I promised you, I'm here to help him.

183
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:51,908
Nathan,

184
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:58,231
what if I could offer you
a new life far from here,

185
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:02,869
the life you've always wanted
with the woman you love?

186
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,658
Audrey.

187
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,035
There she is, Nathan.

188
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:18,051
Everything you've ever wanted.

189
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,188
And I'm giving her to you.

190
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:32,608
You want to give me a copy of Audrey?

191
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:35,192
One that loves you with all her heart.

192
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,279
I'll take you both outside the shroud,

193
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:42,115
set you up in a new life
far away from here.

194
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:44,901
Neither one of you will remember Haven.

195
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:48,738
Nathan, I'm offering you a fresh start.

196
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,576
Why?

197
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:54,411
Why would you do this?

198
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:56,609
Oh, Dove,

199
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:00,917
what is coming...

200
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:05,672
It'll be such a wonderful time for us.

201
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,841
You don't have to worry about Nathan.

202
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:11,096
This way you know he's taken
care of, that he's happy.

203
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:14,187
You think that copy can make me happy?

204
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:16,870
I assure you you will never know

205
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:19,584
or be able to tell the difference.

206
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,655
Well, if she's so perfect,

207
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:23,490
why don't you just keep her for yourself?

208
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:24,991
I said you would never know the difference.

209
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:26,293
I'm her father. I would know.

210
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:28,445
You think I would abandon Audrey

211
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,995
for some illusion?

212
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,586
I belong here in Haven
with Audrey, fighting you.

213
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:09,927
What do you want, Duke?

214
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:12,762
Question is, what do you want, Dwight?

215
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,648
Right now I want to kill you
for murdering my friends

216
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,099
and betraying us to Croatoan.

217
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:19,902
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.

218
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:22,405
Do you have a second choice,

219
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:25,675
like, perhaps, raising your daughter?

220
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:27,526
My daughter's dead.

221
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:30,579
No. She's right in there.

222
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:33,165
- That's not Lizzie.
- Are you sure?

223
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,702
Croatoan used a very special
trouble to bring her back.

224
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:38,788
He must really like you.

225
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,456
Yeah. Why did he send you here, Duke?

226
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,791
What does Croatoan want?

227
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:44,396
The controller crystal.

228
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,013
What makes him think I have it?

229
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,782
He knows that you have it.

230
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:50,933
The crystal isn't here.

231
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:53,352
Then go and get it.

232
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:57,640
Deliver it to Croatoan, and
he will let you keep Lizzie.

233
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,275
I think you know me better than that, Duke.

234
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:02,028
Then he will come for her.

235
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:06,532
Or maybe he'll just send me.

236
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:16,792
Where's Lizzie?

237
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:17,993
Upstairs.

238
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,569
What did Duke want?

239
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,883
He said Lizzie's some kind
of gift from Croatoan,

240
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,217
an example of his power.

241
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:27,303
He's going to let you keep her?

242
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,545
I'm not even sure she is a her.

243
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:32,258
I mean, come on, Vince, she
can't really be my daughter.

244
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,643
I see the way you look at her, Dwight.

245
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:36,729
It's not just that child.

246
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:39,515
A part of you has been
brought back to life here.

247
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:50,414
Losing Lizzie...

248
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:55,039
watching those bullets tear
into her, it was like dying.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,367
For a long time, I wanted to die.

250
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:04,250
Thought about ending it, a lot.

251
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,643
I know.

252
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,543
I was afraid for you.

253
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:09,628
[sighs]

254
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,873
It took so long to crawl out of that hole.

255
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:19,972
I can't go through that again.

256
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:21,466
I know.

257
00:14:22,643 --> 00:14:25,694
And to this day, I feel responsible.

258
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:27,509
I led the Guard.

259
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:30,876
They were my men who shot Lizzie.

260
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:34,309
I couldn't make it right back then.

261
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,406
I can never make it right.

262
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:43,546
How terribly ironic if Croatoan can.

263
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,675
I can't believe I let you
involve Intern in all of this.

264
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,093
What if Croatoan finds out

265
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:00,396
she's helping you and sends Duke after her?

266
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,231
If my trouble can fix it,

267
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,849
you know I have to try, Gloria.

268
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:05,768
Yeah, well, it doesn't
mean I have to like it.

269
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,318
It's really good, Vickie.

270
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:11,273
When I'm done, if we fold it here,

271
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,075
the crack in the core should close.

272
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,245
And then we will give it to Vince,

273
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:18,247
and finally we can build a new Barn.

274
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:19,686
Get rid of Croatoan.

275
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:22,368
[chuckles] Rock, paper, scissors.

276
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,452
Stick with the paper, kid.

277
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,120
They never see it coming.

278
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:27,396
Got a few more security cameras going.

279
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:29,424
Perimeter looks good.

280
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,095
(Audrey) Nathan.

281
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,517
We...

282
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,352
I think we might need to
talk about something.

283
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:41,476
Ah.

284
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,834
I'm not leaving you.

285
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:47,359
Croatoan's offer has to be a little...

286
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,978
tempting.

287
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,036
You're asking me if I
want all this to be over,

288
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,901
live behind some white picket fence,

289
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,073
adopt a shelter dog?

290
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:00,443
Of course I do.

291
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,626
But I want that with the
real Audrey Parker,

292
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,661
not some copy.

293
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:09,131
You wouldn't even remember
that she wasn't real.

294
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:13,836
How can I claim to love you as much as I do

295
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:17,089
if I don't at least give you that chance?

296
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:20,809
Your asking me to consider this is exactly

297
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:25,898
the reason why I never, never could.

298
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:31,060
Vickie's almost done with the core.

299
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:35,407
We are gonna beat Croatoan, save Duke,

300
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,244
and get our lives back.

301
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:39,578
Yeah.

302
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,780
[phone beeps]

303
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,999
Laverne, do you have something?

304
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,340
(Audrey) Duke.

305
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:03,949
Come out, come out,

306
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:07,872
wherever you are.

307
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,342
Where did they run to, Laverne?

308
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:21,512
[chuckles]

309
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,937
You can play all the games you want.

310
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,806
I'm getting what I came for.

311
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:45,125
Vickie, you have been very, very busy.

312
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:57,509
Still warm, Nathan.

313
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:02,898
Okay, what do we do now?

314
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,700
Well, we can't stay here.

315
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:06,568
Why? We're 3 feet above the lava.

316
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,516
We need to rescue the princess
before the dragon gets her.

317
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:10,706
I thought you were the princess.

318
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,074
No, silly, I'm Lizzie the Lionhearted,

319
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:13,492
and you're Dwight the Dauntless.

320
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:14,743
It's how we always play.

321
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:16,661
Right. Right. Okay.

322
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:18,831
Well, we need some stepping stones.

323
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,504
- Here goes nothing.
- Hang on.

324
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:26,922
[both laugh]

325
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:28,640
We made it. Did we rescue the princess?

326
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,319
Yes, but you melted your feet.

327
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:32,728
Oh. [exhales]

328
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,996
Darn.

329
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,370
It's been a while. I'm a little rusty.

330
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,473
Dad, we played last week.

331
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,103
Lizzie...

332
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:45,607
That was a lot of fun.

333
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,409
There's some milk and
cookies in the kitchen.

334
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:49,445
- I'd say we deserve them.
- [laughs]

335
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:56,335
She has no idea she died?

336
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:58,504
No, but she remembers everything else.

337
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,579
She even called herself
Lizzie the Lionhearted.

338
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:01,673
How could she know that?

339
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,376
Have you noticed anything
different about her?

340
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:06,845
Not yet. But the cookies...

341
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,931
- The cookies are a test.
- A test?

342
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,383
It's been a thing for her
since her mother left.

343
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,185
I stocked that kitchen
with ten types of cookies.

344
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,020
If that's my daughter,

345
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:16,605
she'll bring out two types... her
favorite and her least favorite,

346
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,557
and they'll be arranged on
the plate like a flower.

347
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,858
Oh.

348
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:26,565
Milk and cookies, Mr. Teagues.

349
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:32,654
[laughs] What a polite young lady.

350
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,907
Thank you, Lizzie.

351
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,504
How's it going, Vickie?

352
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:50,839
- Almost there.
- Hurry.

353
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,674
Laverne may have been able to
move this wall to hide us,

354
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:54,142
but Duke won't be fooled for long.

355
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:55,844
Or fooled at all.

356
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:58,754
Duke knows this place like the
back of his hand, poor kid.

357
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:00,933
Finished.

358
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:01,934
Good.

359
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,519
So if you fold it,

360
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:06,071
the core should be able
to fuse together, right?

361
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:09,491
- Nathan.
- Duke.

362
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,443
Stop.

363
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,494
Don't make me shoot.

364
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,979
Duke.

365
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,497
Go.

366
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:18,917
[grunts]

367
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,371
We have to get the core fixed.

368
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,423
Laverne, slow him down.

369
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:29,877
[gasps]

370
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:31,635
(Duke) I want that drawing, Vickie.

371
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:32,494
Oh, Jesus.

372
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:35,384
Duke, please. This isn't you.

373
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:39,471
Oh, this is me, just with improvements.

374
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,057
The Duke I know stands up
to bullies like Croatoan.

375
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,775
You don't want to hurt Vickie.

376
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:47,068
I should've killed you
when you were a statue.

377
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:49,982
[grunts]

378
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,617
Go.

379
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,235
- The Aether core.
- Got it.

380
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:54,847
No.

381
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,240
You don't.

382
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:04,162
Ah.

383
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,498
No.

384
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:28,045
I always liked your trouble, Vickie.

385
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,881
I can't wait to try it out.

386
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,197
Oh, is it your turn now?

387
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:49,150
You going to tell me how
much I mean to you?

388
00:21:49,152 --> 00:21:50,568
How we're family?

389
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,952
No.

390
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:53,307
No?

391
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,242
Hundreds and hundreds of
your little speeches...

392
00:21:58,244 --> 00:22:01,996
"trouble whispering"
all of your little lambs.

393
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:07,420
You must have something special
in your bag of trick for me.

394
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:09,672
I'm not going to tell you
what you already know,

395
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:11,922
that what you're doing is wrong.

396
00:22:11,924 --> 00:22:14,925
I'm not going to beg for our lives, Duke.

397
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:17,318
Don't be so melodramatic.

398
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:21,015
Croatoan wants you alive.

399
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:23,669
Nathan too, for now.

400
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:27,521
As long as the old lady
doesn't get in my way,

401
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:32,100
I will take the artiste and go.

402
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,361
[sobs]

403
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:38,032
- I will not let you kill Vickie.
- Oh, I see.

404
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:42,870
You'll only let me kill when
it serves your purpose.

405
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:45,539
Well, I don't work for you anymore.

406
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,258
You never worked for us.

407
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,094
No, Duke's right.

408
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:51,887
We used you.

409
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:55,976
I used you.

410
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:59,019
When we found out about
the Crocker family curse,

411
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:00,554
about what it could do,

412
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:02,857
I used that as a tool to stop the Troubles

413
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:05,025
because that's what I was sent here to do.

414
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:08,145
But I didn't think about how
much it was going to hurt you,

415
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:11,010
how killing all of those people, how...

416
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:14,406
how it would change you.

417
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,569
It didn't change anything.

418
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:22,376
This was always meant to be.

419
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:24,662
I don't think it was.

420
00:23:26,276 --> 00:23:29,744
I think you were fighting your destiny.

421
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:34,588
And if left alone, maybe
you might have even won.

422
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,056
But I didn't know that.

423
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:40,227
And I came along, and I
sent you on that path.

424
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:44,343
And for that, I am truly sorry.

425
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:49,937
I know how it feels, Duke,
to be fighting to be the person

426
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:51,689
that you want to be when everyone

427
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:53,440
is telling you to be someone else.

428
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:56,277
Croatoan thinks that I'm his daughter.

429
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:58,445
I-I look like her.

430
00:23:58,447 --> 00:23:59,864
I sound like her.

431
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:02,583
Do you know how easy it
would be to just say,

432
00:24:02,585 --> 00:24:04,002
"Sure,

433
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,819
it's good to see you, Dad,"

434
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,019
and stop being scared?

435
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,931
I'm so tired.

436
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:27,379
I'm so tired of fighting my destiny.

437
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:31,979
But I can't give up.

438
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,822
Because when I look in the mirror,

439
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:38,119
I only see me.

440
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:43,371
I see the person that I truly am.

441
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,569
The only person I want to be.

442
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:51,886
So tell me, Duke, when
you look in the mirror,

443
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:54,969
when no one else is around,

444
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:59,256
who are you?

445
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:19,326
I'm Duke Crocker.

446
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:21,946
And I just want to go
back to being a pirate.

447
00:25:25,418 --> 00:25:26,450
Yes.

448
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,634
Time to eat your peanut butter.

449
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:45,052
I already ate mine.

450
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:46,335
Yuck.

451
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,772
Maybe we shouldn't eat the
cookies we don't like.

452
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:50,307
But we always do it that way.

453
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:52,097
You have to eat the yucky one.

454
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:53,963
Why, Lizzie?

455
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:57,102
Why do we always eat a
cookie we don't like?

456
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,240
'Cause that's how life is.

457
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:01,402
Sometimes it hands you a bad cookie,

458
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:02,903
like when you got hurt in the Army

459
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:05,572
or when Mom left us.

460
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:08,869
But if you hang in there,

461
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,995
the good cookies will come, right?

462
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:13,247
Right, like how we still have each other.

463
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:19,711
Like how we still have each other.

464
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:23,674
[gentle music]

465
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:31,192
Hey.

466
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:33,635
(Gloria) Welcome back, kiddo.

467
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:35,596
Glad to be back.

468
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,110
I knew you could beat him.

469
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:39,304
Yeah, not soon enough.

470
00:26:40,162 --> 00:26:41,275
We have to make sure

471
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:42,693
that Croatoan doesn't find out about you.

472
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:44,111
Is there any way that you

473
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:46,080
can use your phasing trouble
to get out of town?

474
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:47,664
I'm not going anywhere.

475
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,618
I'm going to kill Croatoan.

476
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,704
No. No way.

477
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:55,616
You're not going anywhere near him.

478
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,960
Nathan, the things that he made me do,

479
00:26:59,962 --> 00:27:02,262
the people I killed, the friends I hurt,

480
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:05,716
what I did to the both of you...
He's trying to split you up.

481
00:27:05,718 --> 00:27:07,801
He knows you are stronger together.

482
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:11,472
Please, you have to let me help.

483
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:12,973
I need to make things right.

484
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:14,308
You will.

485
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,476
I promise.

486
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:18,312
But we have to be careful.

487
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:20,364
If Croatoan gets a hold of
one of your Troubles...

488
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:23,317
[eerie music]

489
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,736
[groaning]

490
00:27:27,156 --> 00:27:28,906
What? What's wrong?

491
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:30,309
He knows.

492
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,910
Croatoan knows.

493
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:35,001
He's taking them. I can't stop him.

494
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:41,832
What can we do?

495
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:49,643
There's got to be something that we can do.

496
00:27:49,645 --> 00:27:51,562
There is.

497
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,341
You have to kill me.

498
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:11,648
You have to kill me. Now.

499
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:13,201
Before he takes any more.

500
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:14,736
There has to be another way.

501
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:15,737
There isn't.

502
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:16,738
Duke...

503
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,288
Whenever a Crocker has died,

504
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,574
the Troubles stayed with them.

505
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,347
If I'm dead,

506
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:27,080
Croatoan has no way of collecting them.

507
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:29,716
No, Duke.

508
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,803
I can't.

509
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:34,226
Yes, you can, Nathan.

510
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:39,760
You can to save Haven, to save Audrey.

511
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:42,562
No. No, not like this.

512
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:43,730
Look, I'd do it myself, right?

513
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:45,182
I'd go up to the roof and jump.

514
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,935
But if I break open and
bleed out all my Troubles,

515
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:49,772
then I died for nothing.

516
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:53,698
Croatoan took everything from me.

517
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,159
I have to take something back.

518
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:59,746
I have to choose my destiny.

519
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:06,670
I have to show Croatoan that
Duke Crocker's nobody's bitch.

520
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:11,959
So please.

521
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:16,964
Please.

522
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,132
Come on, please.

523
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,969
Please!

524
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:23,470
[sighs]

525
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:25,973
Gloria?

526
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:27,774
No, I'm sorry, Duke.

527
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,647
Do you see that?

528
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:35,449
Who knows which one that was?

529
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:38,402
You have no idea the horrible Troubles

530
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:39,820
that I've taken inside of me.

531
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:43,707
And if I let Croatoan
get them, then he wins.

532
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,650
That's not my destiny.

533
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,640
That's not me.

534
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:55,649
No.

535
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,007
Nathan, please.

536
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,259
I can't do it myself.

537
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:03,654
There's no time.

538
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,846
I know.

539
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:07,431
[sighs]

540
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:09,366
Everything's gonna be all right.

541
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,108
[gasps]

542
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:21,862
(Audrey) Nathan.

543
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,030
[grunts]

544
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:24,531
[crying]

545
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:36,760
Hey.

546
00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:40,797
Duke, it's gonna be okay, all right?

547
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,625
We love you.

548
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,104
You are the bravest man I ever met,

549
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:49,022
Duke Crocker, you always have been.

550
00:30:49,024 --> 00:30:51,352
So much we've done together.

551
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:54,861
So much we never could've done without you.

552
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:58,398
I owe you so much.

553
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,983
I will spend the rest of my life

554
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,486
trying to repay that debt.

555
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,076
Oh, God.

556
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:12,079
[somber music]

557
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,391
[exhales]

558
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,746
(Vince) I'm so sorry.

559
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:50,250
What Duke became wasn't who he was.

560
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:53,957
No, and in the end, it's what saved us.

561
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,173
Maybe all of Haven.

562
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,291
It stopped Croatoan from
getting his Troubles.

563
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,788
The Aether core, it's destroyed.

564
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,380
There will be no way to build a new Barn,

565
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,882
no way to end the Troubles.

566
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,885
[somber music]

567
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:29,039
Dwight, maybe you can just help me

568
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:30,457
get him to the truck.

569
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:32,159
We'll put him on ice until we can give him

570
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:36,296
a proper burial at sea with Jennifer.

571
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,631
He would like that.

572
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:38,832
(Nathan) Yeah.

573
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,717
At sea.

574
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:48,642
I'm gonna take a walk. Be back in a minute.

575
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,346
[sighs]

576
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,855
[footsteps approaching]

577
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,358
Oh, Dwight, glad you came.

578
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,660
That makes one of us.

579
00:33:06,662 --> 00:33:08,111
Difficult decision, I'm sure.

580
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,196
You brought the crystal?

581
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:10,280
The crystal's useless now.

582
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:11,364
Why do you even want it?

583
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,866
Useless to you.

584
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,202
I can do wonders with the
technology behind it.

585
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:16,586
What do you mean?

586
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:22,560
This room is similar to the
one my daughter grew up in.

587
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:27,547
I intend to make an exact
copy of this entire house.

588
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,932
You want to rebuild a house?

589
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:33,019
Not a house, a home.

590
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,915
When Audrey joins me,

591
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,977
we'll live here together, and
we'll be a family once again.

592
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,979
Without Charlotte, of course.

593
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,232
Because you murdered her.

594
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,377
Charlotte betrayed me.

595
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:52,372
She had me banished.

596
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:55,292
Then she tried to poison Mara with lies.

597
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:56,493
Then she killed her.

598
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,161
Mara was evil.

599
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,080
Like father, like daughter.
But Charlotte...

600
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:01,748
Charlotte was good in the sack.

601
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,650
Yeah, she had that going for her.

602
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,803
You know, Dwight,

603
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:09,172
you're lucky that I have
other concerns right now.

604
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,174
You've seen what I can do with people

605
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,051
who try to take what's mine.

606
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,313
So...

607
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:19,948
the crystal or Lizzie?

608
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,174
Which are you gonna bring me?

609
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:26,189
Are you really going to walk away?

610
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,271
I'm giving you a second chance
with your daughter, Dwight.

611
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:32,517
I, more than anyone, know
how remarkable that can be.

612
00:34:32,998 --> 00:34:36,950
Are you really going to walk away from it?

613
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:42,982
I'll be back in a few hours.

614
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:46,160
With the crystal.

615
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,878
You made the right choice, Dwight.

616
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:51,264
You all have.

617
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:58,355
[soft music]

618
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:14,507
[chuckles]

619
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:18,220
Thanks, Laverne.

620
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:21,044
I needed that.

621
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:23,330
[phone ringing]

622
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:28,585
Laverne, what is it?

623
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:31,022
Is some... Is something wrong?

624
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:41,204
Good, Nathan's back.

625
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:47,083
Laverne, where is he going?

626
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,522
Try to follow him.

627
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,081
No.

628
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:02,619
Where are they going?

629
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,413
Last time it was the carrot,

630
00:36:08,415 --> 00:36:10,115
so I assume you're here with a stick.

631
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:11,616
[chuckles]

632
00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:14,870
There's that wry sense
of humor the girls love.

633
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:18,423
Mara thought William was hilarious.

634
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:21,676
I thought he was a moron.

635
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:22,878
What do you want?

636
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,463
To offer my condolences.

637
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:26,018
Shame about Duke.

638
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:30,029
The Crockers grew so
cowardly over the years.

639
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,720
Duke died so you wouldn't get

640
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,179
any of his Troubles.

641
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:34,940
He died a hero.

642
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,858
He walked away from greatness.

643
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:41,563
Have you thought any more about my offer?

644
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,065
No.

645
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,729
My future's here.

646
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,153
Not without Audrey, it isn't.

647
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,657
What have you done with Audrey?

648
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:54,126
Where is she?

649
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,328
Audrey is going to be exactly
where she belongs...

650
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,631
By her father's side, which means you...

651
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:05,220
Need to leave Haven.

652
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,403
I knew you'd come here, someplace familiar.

653
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:27,692
If you need to talk...

654
00:37:27,694 --> 00:37:30,078
What have you done with Nathan?

655
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,580
If you've hurt him...

656
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,830
Hurt him?

657
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,501
Nathan told me he had said his good-byes.

658
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,309
His good-byes?

659
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,791
What does that mean?

660
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,210
Before he left with your copy.

661
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,182
I thought you knew. I'm so sorry.

662
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,470
No.

663
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:57,556
No, that's not true.

664
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,206
I'm afraid it is.

665
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:02,414
Nathan is...

666
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:05,030
beyond the shroud.

667
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,692
[indistinct chatter]

668
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:26,968
Parker.

669
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,003
Nathan.

670
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,641
This is weird.

671
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,208
Yeah.

672
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:36,144
What can I get you two?

673
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:39,431
Uh, actually maybe you could tell me,

674
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:42,601
did you see us come in?

675
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:45,770
Oh, things get so busy
around here sometimes,

676
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:48,039
all I see are hash browns.

677
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:49,533
But...

678
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,277
now that I come to think of it,

679
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:54,246
I could've sworn this table was empty,

680
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,867
and then I turned around,
and there you were.

681
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,369
Ah, maybe we all need a cup of coffee?

682
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:03,121
- Sugar.
- Black.

683
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,172
Thanks.

684
00:39:20,474 --> 00:39:22,524
Don't worry.

685
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:28,146
At least we're together.
We'll figure it out.

686
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:29,147
Yeah.

687
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:31,190
We always do.

688
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,239
Nathan told me he changed his mind.

689
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,457
The tragedy of having to kill his friend...

690
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:41,326
He realized the futility of fighting me.

691
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:42,712
No.

692
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:46,248
Nathan never would've left
of his own free will.

693
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,906
I'm sorry, but it's true.

694
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,641
He begged me to take him away from Haven.

695
00:39:51,004 --> 00:39:55,320
He said that saving the world

696
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:58,343
had become too exhausting.

697
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:00,645
I know you're upset.

698
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:02,847
But really, isn't this what you want?

699
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:04,766
Nathan far away

700
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:07,652
from the terrible dangers
he would've faced?

701
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:12,691
Dangers?

702
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:14,359
Well, once we begin our experiments,

703
00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:16,861
there will be a lot of trial and error.

704
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:19,090
Things will become...

705
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,283
volatile.

706
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,085
No. I'm not helping you.

707
00:40:25,872 --> 00:40:27,872
This is what you were meant to do.

708
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:29,908
Nathan abandoned you.

709
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,111
But not me.

710
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:37,382
I will never abandon you.

711
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:48,143
You don't have to be so morose.

712
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:52,897
Attitude is the paintbrush
that colors our world.

713
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:02,240
[thunder]

714
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:05,160
What we're about to do will be wonderful.

715
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:15,470
[shivers]

716
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,756
What is that?

717
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:20,596
Mm, the question is, what is behind that?

718
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,786
I'm using an abrasion trouble

719
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,934
to create an opening to the Void.

720
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,683
Why is it...

721
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:29,768
Turning black?

722
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,403
It's filling with Aether.

723
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,105
And soon it will rain,

724
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:37,692
and then you and I will begin our work.

725
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:38,993
And it won't seem like work

726
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:41,946
because we'll have casual Friday,

727
00:41:42,818 --> 00:41:45,456
we'll have music, bring dogs.

728
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:53,925
Take a few hours before
there's enough Aether

729
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:56,264
and we can get to work, so...

730
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:59,547
go grieve,

731
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:00,765
make your peace,

732
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:04,719
do whatever you have to do to move on,

733
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,083
because Nathan

734
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:08,844
is gone.

735
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:11,849
Your life

736
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:16,528
is with me, here,

737
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,751
now.
