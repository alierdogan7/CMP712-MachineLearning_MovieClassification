1
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,780
Hey, Jerry.

2
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,150
Hey, Mr. Kowalski.

3
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:34,319
Call me Dennis.
It's okay.

4
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,388
Just wanted to say
we're very pleased.

5
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,823
You're doing a great job.

6
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,358
Thank you,
Mr. Kowalski.

7
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,826
That's what
I told that lady
from the courts.

8
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,262
"A great job," I said.
She's your lawyer?

9
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,930
She's a court-appointed
psychiatrist, Dennis.

10
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,933
- Thank you for...
thank you for saying that.
- No problem.

11
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:52,437
So, Jerry, the thing is,
is Milton Fixtures every year

12
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,439
has the company party,
a barbecue.

13
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,676
- Okay.
- And we get one representative
from each department

14
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,545
to help put it on,
usually the new guy.

15
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,881
And the new guy
in Shipping is you.

16
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,350
So, you...

17
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,785
want me to help
plan the party?

18
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,787
It's voluntary,
off the clock.

19
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,489
There will be
others, too.

20
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,824
Someone from Sales,
a guy from Design,

21
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,561
that cute English chick
in Accounting, Fiona.

22
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,763
- You wanna do it?
- Yes, I do!
Of course I do.

23
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:18,897
- Thank you.
- Cool.

24
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,465
First meeting
is tomorrow night at 5:00.

25
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,767
Yeah, I wanna get it on.
I wanna get it on.

26
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,468
The company buys
pizza and beer.

27
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,603
Okay, I'm in.
Thank you, Dennis.

28
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:25,938
- It'll be fun.
- Thank you, Dennis.

29
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,573
Okay, okay.

30
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,623
Bosco!

31
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,526
Who's my guy?
Who's my guy?

32
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,528
Who's my guy?
Who's my guy?

33
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,263
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

34
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,497
<i>You're a good boy!</i>

35
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,734
You're a good boy!

36
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,443
<i>What you doin', Jerry?</i>

37
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,944
Something for work.

38
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,647
<i>Those assholes give you
homework now?</i>

39
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,817
Trying on a shirt
for tomorrow.

40
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,587
- They got something
that they want me to do.
-<i> A shirt?</i>

41
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,956
-<i> Shouldn't that be</i>
<i>a straitjacket?</i>
- Shut up.

42
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,692
<i>You act like</i>
<i>they're doing you a favor</i>
<i>to let you work there,</i>

43
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,394
<i>like they should be able
to fuck you in the ass</i>

44
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,795
<i>without lube
whenever they want,</i>

45
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,497
<i>like some big privilege,</i>

46
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,400
<i>letting you work for free
on their picnic.</i>

47
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,870
How do you know
about the picnic?

48
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,040
- <i> I know everything, Jerry.</i>
- I'm not talking to you.

49
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,609
<i>They'll mock you</i>
<i>the second you leave</i>
<i>the room, Jerry.</i>

50
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,611
<i>You're an unstable
crybaby.</i>

51
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,946
I'm not a crybaby.

52
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,781
<i>You're crying right now,
liar.</i>

53
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,416
<i>Come on.</i>

54
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,917
<i>The only reason
they don't fire your ass</i>

55
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,719
<i>is because you're
so hopelessly pathetic,</i>

56
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,454
- <i> you amuse them.</i>
- Shut up!

57
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,532
Before we break up here,
I wanna go over

58
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,734
<i>the assignments.</i>

59
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,469
We're... we're just gonna
go around the table, okay?

60
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,038
Can your comment wait?

61
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,773
I just wanna say
that the picnic

62
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,608
<i>is gonna be a good place
to reach out</i>

63
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,010
and form relationships
with other people.

64
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,581
Duly noted, Jerry.

65
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,884
We all wanna
get out of here, so...

66
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:21,019
John, you'll be setting up
the barbecue grills

67
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,388
in the parking lot,
Dave's bringing drinks,

68
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,390
Sheryl's providing
decorations,

69
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,426
and Fiona's doing
the music.

70
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,827
- Any questions?
- Oh, yeah.

71
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,430
I've got an idea
while we were sitting here.

72
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,432
You know
the office corridor?

73
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:36,335
I thought it would be
the perfect place
for a conga line.

74
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,769
Mmm, like at a wedding?

75
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,472
Or a cruise ship.

76
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,341
It's really easy.
Anyone can conga.

77
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,609
I'll set my head on fire
before I conga.

78
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,479
Men are afraid to dance.
The male ego is too fragile.

79
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,681
I'm not afraid.
I'm a man.

80
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,982
I think it sounds
real fun.

81
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,385
Thanks, Jerry.

82
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,554
<i>Well, it's not</i>
<i>the coolest thing</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

83
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,622
but we're talking about
a party in a toilet factory,
after all.

84
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,925
Okay, it's settled.
We'll go with the conga line.

85
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,860
Moving on.
Jerry?

86
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,862
I'm setting up
the P.A. system tomorrow,

87
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,864
so if everything works out,
I'm good to go.

88
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,433
And, uh,
I thank you all.

89
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,136
And my extension
in Shipping is 5-1865.

90
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,373
- No.
<i>Dave,</i>
<i>go screw yourself.</i>

91
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,708
Sheryl, Dave, come on.
We're done here.

92
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,377
We'll see you all
at the picnic.

93
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,846
Anyone who wants
the leftover pizza,

94
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,048
please take it.

95
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,616
- Bye.
- Bye.

96
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,629
Hey, do you want
any of this pizza, John?

97
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,897
Cold pizza?
No, thank you.

98
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,599
Oh, free pizza.

99
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:41,967
What's better
than free pizza?

100
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,770
Lots of things.
Sushi, for example.

101
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:45,871
I don't know.
That's like raw fish, right?

102
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,606
No.

103
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,976
It's perfectly cooked rice
seasoned by a master chef

104
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,545
on top of which he places
specially selected slices

105
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,615
of the highest quality,
line-caught ocean fish.

106
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,451
Raw fish.
Gross.

107
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,653
You should
stick to fast food.

108
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,891
- Jerry?
- Hey, Fiona.

109
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,859
Hey.

110
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,662
Can your sound system
play music from an iPod?

111
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,597
I think so, yeah.

112
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,133
Cool, it's a plan.
See ya.

113
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,617
How are you doing,
Jerry?

114
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,619
Oh, uh, very well,
thank you.

115
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,954
Excellent, yeah.

116
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,489
Do tell.

117
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,825
Well, uh...

118
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,126
they like me at work.

119
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,095
- You're a likeable man.
- <i> We're having a...</i>

120
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,597
a what do you call it...
a picnic,

121
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,099
and they asked me
to help out on it.

122
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,469
I was afraid
to say yes...

123
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,839
and then I said yes.

124
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,874
- And?
- Um...

125
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,809
and now I'm setting up
the sound system.

126
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,011
That's wonderful news.

127
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,880
You're becoming
part of something.

128
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,483
Any side effects
with the meds?

129
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,818
I don't know.

130
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,221
- <i> Are you taking them?</i>
- I don't know.

131
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,556
You have to take them.

132
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,158
Okay.

133
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,828
<i>Any thoughts of suicide?</i>

134
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,129
No, none.

135
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,032
Do you ever hear voices?

136
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,568
Mm, voices? No.

137
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,737
I mean...

138
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,206
when someone's
talking to me.

139
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,675
<i>You hesitated
a little bit there.</i>

140
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,797
It just makes me think
of my mother.

141
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,548
Angels was what
she called her voices.

142
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,150
Yeah.

143
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,653
Angels were
her coping strategy.

144
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,921
The voices were real to her.

145
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,123
Angels were
a reasonable attempt

146
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,058
to craft a logical
explanation.

147
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,960
I know.
I know that.
Yeah, I know.

148
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,263
She was the best mother
that she knew how to be,
you know?

149
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,298
Right, exactly.

150
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,035
Do you have any questions
for me, Jerry?

151
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,038
Oh, yeah.
I got a big one for you.

152
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,774
- Okay.

153
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,043
There's a girl.

154
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,112
I like her.

155
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,547
Go on.

156
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,816
I don't know
how much to tell her,

157
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,119
you know,
about you and this
and my mom and stuff.

158
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,987
And?

159
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,229
I don't wanna
scare her away.

160
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,594
But I don't wanna
lie to her, either.

161
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,329
<i>I'm thinking</i>
<i>that if the subject</i>
<i>comes up, um...</i>

162
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,665
I'll just tell her.

163
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:30,869
But if it doesn't,
I'll just leave it be.

164
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,805
You answered
your own question, Jerry.

165
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,007
Why are you smiling?

166
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,676
We're gonna conga
tomorrow.

167
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:41,179
- Conga?
- Yeah.

168
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,714
You know,
like at a wedding.

169
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:43,882
It's gonna be amazing.

170
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,351
Conga?

171
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,343
Hey, buddy!

172
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,380
Oh, Bosco, what a day!
What a day!

173
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,415
I wish you
could've been there!

174
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,632
Did you fuck
the bitch?

175
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,888
I don't have
to answer that.

176
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,358
And you'll
never fuck her either,
because you disgust her.

177
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,827
- Shush!
- Yeah, shut up, cat.

178
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,129
<i>- She's from England,
- Jerry.</i>

179
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,931
In her eyes,
you're a ridiculous peasant.

180
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,200
Oh, oh, yeah.
Guess what.

181
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,070
I'm not a peasant,
Mr. Whiskers. Hmm?

182
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,006
I'm thinking that this
is a real good time
for a walk, Jerry.

183
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,975
I think that's
a fantastic idea.

184
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,943
You're out your league.

185
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,312
<i>She drinks tea in carriages
and fucks men</i>

186
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,784
- Not Jerry Hickfang.

187
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,053
- Go choke on a hairball.
- Cat hater.

188
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,187
Come on, Bosco.
Let's go, buddy.

189
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,222
<i>Come on.</i>

190
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,707
Okay,
I'll tone it down
a little bit.

191
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,443
You have
the greatest hair, Tom.

192
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:54,012
In the back.
It's awesome.

193
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,023
- Shift's over, Jer.

194
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,372
- Jerry.
- Hi.

195
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,776
Fiona.

196
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:27,412
You said I should come by
Accounting sometime.

197
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,314
- I did?
- Yeah.

198
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:32,417
When we were
getting ready
for the picnic.

199
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,353
No, I-I don't recall
saying that.

200
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,055
<i>Hi, Jerry.
I'm Lisa.</i>

201
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,890
Accounts Receivable.

202
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,826
Jerry.
Packing and Shipping.

203
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,129
Some of
the Accounting chicks

204
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,297
are going out
for a couple of drinks

205
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,533
if you wanna pack
and ship out with us.

206
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,903
Oh, yeah.
That sounds... yeah.

207
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,438
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

208
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Okay.

209
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,042
Ugh.

210
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,345
<i>So he looks me in the eye
and he says,</i>

211
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,281
"Let's move to America, Fi.
Let's get married."

212
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,851
So, after I've sold
everything and moved,

213
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,387
that's when
the knobhead decides that
he's not the marrying type.

214
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,789
Aw.

215
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,825
Yeah, six months later,
he marries Jill.

216
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,961
Now they've got three kids
and I'm stuck in this
stupid temp job.

217
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,564
I think it's time
to move back home.

218
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,132
I know karate.

219
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,573
Thanks for coming out,
Jerry.

220
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:29,575
It's cool.

221
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,313
Do you want my last
Krunchy Choo-Choo?

222
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,416
- I only had a bite.
- Yeah, sure.

223
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,987
Hey, can you give me
a ride to my car?

224
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,356
Or, just home,
you know.

225
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,995
- Sorry.
- Um...

226
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,298
You're giving a ride
to Fiona.

227
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,834
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay, Jerry.
I've got a lift.

228
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,168
- So...
- I don't mind, Fi.

229
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,410
I'd love to, uh,
give you a ride.

230
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,608
Okay.

231
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,909
So, you...

232
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,444
<i>you're... okay.</i>

233
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,280
I can just get a cab.

234
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,565
- What are you
doing this weekend?
- I was hoping on...

235
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,435
There's this cool
Chinese restaurant
that I wanted take you to.

236
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,937
- <i> Shi Shan.</i>
- Chinese?

237
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,541
Yeah, but it's more
than just egg rolls
and fortune cookies.

238
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,077
- Do you wanna go?
- When?

239
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,079
On Friday night.
I'll pick you up after work.

240
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,547
No, it's... it's all right.
I don't need a lift.

241
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,382
Or just meet there, then?

242
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,884
The show starts at 7:00.

243
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,385
There's a show?

244
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,921
A show, yes.
More than just a show.

245
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,923
The best spectacle
in the world.

246
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,057
- You'll love it.
- Wow.

247
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,627
- Prepare to be amazed.
- Okay. Cool.

248
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,162
I'll get there early.
I'll save you a seat.

249
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,331
- All right.
- All right.

250
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,371
All right.
Thanks for the ride,
Jerry.

251
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,139
All right.
No problem, Fiona.

252
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,574
Have a good night.

253
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,329
Got a date

254
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,299
with Fiona
on Friday night
from England.

255
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,401
Well, fuck me.

256
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,269
I'm an asshole.

257
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,939
<i>I apologize, man.
You were right.</i>

258
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,074
<i>Cat food's in the kitchen, Jer,
and I can't open the can.</i>

259
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,643
- <i> I don't have thumbs.</i>

260
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,428
Who's my good boy?

261
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,562
Who's my good boy?

262
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,203
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Lisa.

263
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,438
- Hey...
- Alison.

264
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,706
- What's up?
- Where's Fiona?

265
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,375
She just left.
Do you have something for her?

266
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,477
Yeah, she needs
this address.

267
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,012
Shi Shan.

268
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,313
It's the restaurant
where we're gonna meet.

269
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,748
We'll make sure
she gets it.

270
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,685
- Is there anything else?
- No.

271
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,721
Make sure
she gets that, okay?
It's important.

272
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,456
- Yeah, we'll make sure.
- Okay.

273
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,564
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, he's gone.

274
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,099
What is this about?

275
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,568
Oh, it's this
Chinese restaurant.

276
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,103
I said I might
meet him over there.

277
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,437
Well, no.
You can't.

278
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,772
Tonight's karaoke.

279
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,273
Oh, yeah.
Karaoke.

280
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:53,077
Well, just call him and
tell him you can't make it.

281
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,213
No, I don't
want to upset him.

282
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,547
I'll wait until
the office closes

283
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,416
and then I'll leave
a message on voicemail.

284
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,658
You're a real sweetheart,
Fiona.

285
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,267
Whaa!

286
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,328
Hey, fish.

287
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,097
"Hi, Jerry.

288
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,266
How you doing,
man?"

289
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,768
Well, I'm a little
bit bummed.

290
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,770
"No duh.

291
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,773
She stood you up."

292
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,775
I'm sure there's a reason.

293
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,477
"I sure hope so.

294
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,280
I wish I could help you,
Jerry, but I'm just a fish."

295
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,682
Oh.

296
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,352
- Oh, Jesus.
- Have you seen Alison?

297
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,255
- No. I think she's gonna
keep going, actually.
- Oh, shit!

298
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,690
- Oh, no.
- Now my phone's fucked.

299
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,360
- Oh...
- No, that's all right.

300
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,695
I was gonna walk back
to the plant...

301
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,697
Oh, no.
I'll give you a ride.

302
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,699
- Yeah.
- Thank you!
You're the best!

303
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,401
- Okay, you ready?
- Okay.

304
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,336
- Go!

305
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,274
You okay?
- Yeah.

306
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,775
It's so horrible!

307
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,137
Ahh! It's like being
in England again.

308
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,293
You want me to wait?

309
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,961
- No.
- Have a good night.

310
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,300
Ugh.

311
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,782
Bloody hell!

312
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,986
Ugh.

313
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,721
Shit!

314
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,297
Ahh!

315
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,400
Jerry!

316
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,668
<i>Fiona?</i>

317
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:13,971
Jerry.

318
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,683
- Ohh.
- Fiona, you're soaked.

319
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,486
- <i> Get in.</i>
- Wow.

320
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,855
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

321
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,723
What are you doing out here?

322
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,992
I was listening to music.

323
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,727
I-I went to Shi Shan.

324
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,397
<i>I didn't see you there.</i>

325
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,832
Didn't you get my message?

326
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,602
No. No.

327
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,071
- No.
- I'm so sorry, Jerry.

328
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,011
<i>Well, you, uh...</i>

329
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:57,048
need a hot chocolate
or something?

330
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,849
<i>I suppose I owe you,
don't I?</i>

331
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,719
Go on, then.
I'm freezing.

332
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:03,821
I... you're sitting
on a blanket.

333
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,557
- Oh.

334
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,800
<i>Don't stare, Jerry.</i>

335
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,702
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

336
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,871
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not the end
of the world, Jerry.

337
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,809
<i>Oh...</i>

338
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:28,779
God, I'm starving.

339
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,981
<i>Let's get something
to eat.</i>

340
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,550
I got crackers
in the glove box.

341
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:33,951
Oh, no.

342
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,554
We need something horrible
and greasy tonight.

343
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,356
- Do you know Doran's?
- Uh-uh.

344
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,590
You're gonna love it.

345
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,959
It's this terrible, cheap,

346
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,728
<i>all-night burger joint
out by the county line.</i>

347
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,963
- We go.
- And you wanna
go there tonight?

348
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,898
Yes and yes!

349
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,500
Full steam ahead,
Captain.

350
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,069
- And don't spare the chili.
- Yeah, all right.

351
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,949
You know, they say
a lot of things about you
up in Accounting.

352
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,651
Like what?

353
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:10,421
Well, that arty chick Lisa,
she thinks you're hot.

354
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:16,160
And everybody else,
we just wonder where
you're from.

355
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:20,398
Oh, my family
moved here from Berlin
when I was seven.

356
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,869
You know, a kid's gotta go
where his parents take him.

357
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,545
I don't even
have that excuse.

358
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,116
Why do you
live here, then?

359
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,819
Oh, God.
Well, if you
find out, call me.

360
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,888
- Hm.
- No, sorry.

361
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,423
No, that came out wrong.
I'm sorry.

362
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,924
You don't like Milton?

363
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,093
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
It's nice.

364
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:52,630
You know,
the people are friendly.
It's pretty.

365
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:56,167
No. High school football
and karaoke bars isn't enough.

366
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,438
I'm bored.

367
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,007
Insanely bored.

368
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:05,142
You like
heaven better, huh?

369
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,011
Heaven?

370
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,780
- What?
- Where you're from.

371
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,483
Heaven?

372
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:16,454
Hardly.
No, I'm from Reading.

373
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,122
Reading is a lot closer
to hell.

374
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:22,726
Oh.

375
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,795
You like trivia?

376
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,230
- <i> Yes. Why?</i>
- I got a good one.

377
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:29,533
Okay,
there's tons of angels
in the Bible,

378
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,101
but only four of them
have names,

379
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,171
three of which are Michael,
Raphael, and Gabriel.

380
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,108
Who's the fourth?

381
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,944
You're not getting
all religious on me,
are you, Jerry?

382
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,112
No, I... this...
this is fun.

383
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,014
Come on, guess.
Who's the fourth?

384
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,784
I don't know.
Freddy the Angel.

385
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,786
No. Not Freddy.
You know this.

386
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,054
You know his name,
I promise you.

387
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,655
You're forgetting one thing.

388
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,594
You're forgetting
that he's an angel.

389
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,786
Jerry, kill me.
I wanna die.

390
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,623
Take your knife
and cut my throat.

391
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,625
<i>- Don't worry,
- I'll help you.</i>

392
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:28,826
What?

393
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,795
No, no, Jerry!

394
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,517
- No! Don't!
- I gotta do it.
I gotta do it.

395
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,301
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

396
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,143
The fourth angel is Lucifer.

397
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,280
What?

398
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:52,216
Lucifer is an angel
that, uh... a fallen angel.

399
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,788
Fio... Fiona.

400
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,123
<i>Fiona!</i>

401
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,658
<i>He asked me to do it.</i>

402
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,795
Fiona, don't run.

403
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,664
You'll get lost.

404
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,737
- Ah!
- Fiona!

405
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:19,577
- - Ah!

406
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,040
Oh, I don't know
how that happened.

407
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,890
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

408
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,694
Oh...

409
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,333
- You... you're in pain?

410
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,602
You're suffering?

411
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,642
- I love you.

412
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,938
I'm so sorry.

413
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,041
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

414
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:25,943
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

415
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,911
I'm sorry.

416
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,101
- Hi, Jer.
- Not now, buddy.

417
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,503
What the hell
you been doing?

418
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,135
It's okay, Bosco.

419
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,304
Pretty bad situation, buddy.

420
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,373
I know.

421
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,876
Maybe the best thing
to do is just, um,

422
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:07,377
go to the cops
and explain everything.

423
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,447
- Just tell them
what happened?
- Mmm, yeah.

424
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,152
I think you're right.

425
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:17,488
Be good to get it
off my chest.

426
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,023
If I wait, it'll be
a million times worse.

427
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,358
Thanks, Bosco.

428
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,428
You are both
so fucking naive.

429
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,830
<i>You go to the cops
and you say,</i>

430
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:29,233
<i>"Hey, man,</i>
<i>I accidentally stabbed</i>
<i>that English chick.</i>

431
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,901
Oh, oh, oh."

432
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,402
You think
they'll all nod
and understand

433
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,138
<i>the way your
stupid dog does?</i>

434
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,373
- I don't know.
<i>- Well, I do know.</i>

435
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:41,011
where tattooed meth addicts
will buttfuck you daily

436
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,546
<i>for 15 years to life.</i>

437
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:44,381
<i>You're a good man
who made a mistake.</i>

438
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,550
Nobody is gonna
rape you, Jerry.

439
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,552
<i>But he did mean to do it.</i>

440
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,954
- No.
- Not the deer.

441
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,257
That was an accident.
I'm talking about the girl.

442
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,125
- <i> You wanted to kill her.</i>
- Never.

443
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,894
Why'd you take
the knife, then?

444
00:29:56,896 --> 00:30:00,430
Oh, my God.

445
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,432
- I'm evil.
- No, you're not.

446
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,101
I've killed things
on purpose, Jerry.

447
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:06,103
There's no shame in it.
It's instinct.

448
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:09,439
<i>The only time</i>
<i>I felt truly alive</i>
<i>is when I'm killing.</i>

449
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:13,377
The only time
I've ever felt
truly alive.

450
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,546
<i>You see what I mean?</i>

451
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:18,415
But you have to do something
about the body, Jer.

452
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,384
What about the body?

453
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,020
Well, some hiker
stumbles across it,

454
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,055
and pretty soon
it's "CSI: Milton."

455
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:27,558
<i>And guess
whose hair and fiber</i>

456
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,593
<i>and spit and blood
are everywhere.</i>

457
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,094
Yours, Jerry.

458
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,564
Go get rid
of the fucking body,
dipshit.

459
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:34,898
I don't know.

460
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,935
I don't know.

461
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,205
<i>I don't know.</i>

462
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,059
<i>- Hey, Jerry.
- How you doing?</i>

463
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,561
Oh, hey, Sheriff Weinbacher.
I'm good, really good.

464
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,364
Well, what happened here?

465
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,202
A deer jumped in the window.

466
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,405
It was horrible.

467
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,041
- <i> But you're okay?</i>
- Uh... um, yeah.

468
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,510
What did you do with the deer?
That's probably good meat.

469
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,712
Oh.

470
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,647
Uh, I ju... I left it
on the side of the road.

471
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,249
But I shouldn't have
done that.

472
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,684
I screwed up.
I'm really sorry
about that.

473
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,385
No, it was an accident.

474
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,055
I'm not gonna write you up
for hunting out of season.

475
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:41,024
Thank you.

476
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,459
Thank you,
Sheriff Weinbacher.
I appreciate it.

477
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,295
No problem, Jerry.
You get that window fixed, okay?

478
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,431
- - Yeah, I'll do it
right this afternoon.

479
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,166
Cool.
Drive safely, Jerry.

480
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,534
You, too.

481
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,603
Hello?

482
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,640
Oh, crap.

483
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,676
That's... that's right now,
isn't it?

484
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,511
Okay.

485
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,048
Yeah, no, I'm on my way.

486
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,450
On my way.

487
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,995
Headaches?

488
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,497
- Trouble sleeping?
<i>- No.</i>

489
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,435
- Suicidal impulses?
- Uh-uh.

490
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,739
Do you hear voices?

491
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,641
I hear your voice now.

492
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,577
<i>Disembodied voices.</i>

493
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,546
<i>Voices that seem to be
coming from somewhere else.</i>

494
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,015
Not really.

495
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,490
Jerry...

496
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,625
do you find yourself
crying a lot lately?

497
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,127
Uh-uh.

498
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,129
No.

499
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:54,564
- <i> No?</i>
- Mm-mm.

500
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,369
Are you still taking
the medication?

501
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,071
Usually.

502
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,175
You have to take it
every day without fail.

503
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,743
I know.
I know, but...

504
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,578
But what?

505
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,552
The medication,
it smooths things out,
and that's okay, right?

506
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,490
But even though
there were bad moments...

507
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:23,060
- <i> Very bad moments?</i>
- Very bad.

508
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,664
There are also moments
of inspiration and beauty,

509
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,434
when all the world
makes sense

510
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:33,103
and the elegant
secret mechanics
of Man and God

511
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,105
are revealed
in their many dimensions,

512
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:37,207
and the universe
is laid out before mine eyes

513
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,742
and it is a blessed place.

514
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,712
You totally stopped taking
the pills, didn't you?

515
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,414
Totally.

516
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,284
Thanks for your honesty,
Jerry.

517
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,753
Our relationship depends
on the cooperation

518
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,788
of the Department
of Corrections.

519
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,725
If you become noncompliant,
I have to report that.

520
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,429
- They'll put me away?
- Let's not find out.

521
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,465
Let's make you compliant.

522
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,334
- Take the pills.
- Okay. Okay.

523
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,669
Let's not find out.

524
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,336
Ow.

525
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:49,366
<i>Aw, what's the matter, buddy?</i>

526
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,001
I really liked her.

527
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,469
<i>I know you did, buddy.</i>

528
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,638
She's a good kid.

529
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,806
I bet you miss her a lot.

530
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,975
Yeah.

531
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,810
I love you guys.

532
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:18,862
<i>Don't take those pills,
Jerry,</i>

533
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:21,531
<i>unless you wanna say good-bye
to your old friends.</i>

534
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,832
I'm not sure
it's a good idea

535
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,668
to be talking
to your cat, anyway.

536
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,369
Yup.

537
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,772
- Or dog, either.

538
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:32,676
<i>Take those drugs
and you will enter</i>

539
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:35,038
a bleak and lonely
world, Jerry.

540
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,020
<i>Jerry.</i>

541
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,822
<i>Jerry.</i>

542
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,858
Hi, Fiona.

543
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,660
Look what you did to me.

544
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,729
I'm so sorry.

545
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,566
Friday I had
a pretty cushy gig.

546
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:59,836
I had lots of friends.
I was the office hottie.

547
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,439
Now I'm a severed head
in a fridge.

548
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:04,474
Sucks to be me,
Jerry.

549
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:07,010
What can I do about it now?

550
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,412
<i>Take the meds,
you useless wanker.</i>

551
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:11,481
Take them.

552
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:12,782
Take them!

553
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,196
See?
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

554
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,046
<i>Mama?</i>

555
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,151
<i>- Mama?
- Jerry!</i>

556
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:51,855
- Mama?
- <i> Where are you?</i>

557
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,790
Jerry.

558
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,725
- <i>- Pass him over.</i>

559
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:59,028
<i>Go.</i>
<i>Pass him over.</i>
<i>I got him.</i>

560
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,731
- I love you, Jerry.
- Bunny Monkey is my friend.

561
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:05,802
Bunny Monkey
is not real!

562
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:12,041
<i>Mom? Dad?</i>

563
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:17,046
Gotta learn reality
from fantasy, Jerry.

564
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,882
You've got to.

565
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:20,417
It's a sock!

566
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,852
- Be brave, Jerry.
- I love you, Bunny Monkey.

567
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,155
- It's a...
- Don't listen to Mack.

568
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:28,024
- ...a fucking...
- Stay with me
in my world, Jerry.

569
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,193
...sock!

570
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,694
- Just a sock!

571
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,997
<i>A fucking sock.</i>

572
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,239
<i>I wish you
were never born!</i>

573
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,563
<i>You and your mother,
you're fucking psychos.</i>

574
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,692
No.

575
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:38,027
Bosco?
Hey.

576
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,737
- <i> Mr. Whiskers?</i>

577
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,942
Say something.

578
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:55,104
Come on, say something.
Tell me to go F myself.

579
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:01,284
Don't leave me alone.
Come on.

580
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,785
- Tally ho, Jerry.
- Fiona, you're back!

581
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:11,054
Quite.
And jolly well high time.

582
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:13,756
Bloody blooming right
it's jolly well high time.

583
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,826
- You look smashing.
- Those bleeding pills
are rubbish.

584
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:19,295
I super-hate those pills.

585
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,931
I only took them
because you told me to.

586
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,869
Tsk.
Beastly drugs.

587
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,038
They made me look like
a sodding Jack-o-lantern.

588
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,040
You know what.

589
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,277
And you're stinky, too.

590
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:35,812
But now you smell like...

591
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:38,147
You smell
like baby shampoo.

592
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:41,117
- You're beautiful.
- Thanks, Jerry.

593
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,152
What a fab cracking day
to come back.

594
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,021
Perfect day.

595
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:48,057
And I'm eating
Honey Nut Crunchys
with 2% milk.

596
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,359
Hip hip, hooray!

597
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,965
How's the cereal,
chummy chum?

598
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,000
Mmm, delicious.

599
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:58,868
Scrummy.

600
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,370
God save the queen.

601
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:01,938
- <i> Hey, Jerry.</i>
- Mm-hmm?

602
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,239
Jerry.

603
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,241
Can you get me a friend?

604
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:06,676
A friend?

605
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,045
I get so lonely
in the fridge.

606
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,415
Mmm.

607
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,252
Like, kill someone on purpose?

608
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:19,255
By George,
that's it.

609
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,290
Kill someone.

610
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:24,661
What about Lisa
from Accounting?

611
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:26,963
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

612
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,098
Please, Jerry?

613
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,101
Don't be such
a Nancy Boy about it.

614
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,169
Please?

615
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,707
I don't know.

616
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:40,043
- I love you, Jerry.
- I love you, too, Fiona.

617
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,165
I love you so much.

618
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,718
<i>Want some of my Crunchys?</i>

619
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,687
All right, then,
Governor.

620
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,858
Mm. Mm-mm.

621
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,226
- Ow!

622
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,840
Hey, Jerry.

623
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:45,341
Hey, Mr. Kowalski.

624
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,177
I saw you on Friday.

625
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,345
You saw me?

626
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,481
Yeah, I saw you.
You didn't see me?

627
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:53,182
No, I didn't
see you at all.

628
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:54,517
You were at Shi Shan.

629
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,319
I saw you in the window
eating beef chow mein.

630
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,354
Oh! At the restaurant.

631
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,856
Yeah, it's my favorite.

632
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:01,357
Shi Shan.

633
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,925
Thank you for seeing me.

634
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:06,095
I-I didn't do it on purpose.

635
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,398
No, I mean,
I'm just thankful for...
for seeing each other.

636
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,434
You okay, Jerry?

637
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,770
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

638
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:15,271
If you say so.

639
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,873
- See you, Jerry.
- Okay.

640
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:20,376
Oh, one more thing.
Have you seen Fiona?

641
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,911
Fiona?

642
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:24,847
English Fiona
from the party.

643
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,415
Mm-mm. No.
What's up?

644
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:27,917
It's the end
of the quarter.

645
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,385
We're trying
to close out the books

646
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,254
and she's not
answering her phone.

647
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:34,390
Plus, her car is still
in the factory parking lot.

648
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,493
That's sad.

649
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,896
She was nice.

650
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,330
Maybe she went back
to her own country.

651
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:43,466
She wouldn't need
her car anymore.

652
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,802
I'm gonna miss her a lot.

653
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:53,910
Jerry.

654
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:59,315
<i>Oh, that's good.</i>

655
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,119
<i>Oh, that's very good.</i>

656
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:10,326
<i>Oh, that's even better.</i>

657
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:21,537
Oh, Jerry, change
the fucking channel
before I explode.

658
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,607
<i>Oh, that's more like it.</i>

659
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:27,176
Oh, I feel
so much better.

660
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,445
<i>- Jerry is back.
- Yeah!</i>

661
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:32,849
<i>Fuck those pills.</i>
<i>That headshrinker doesn't</i>
<i>care if you're happy.</i>

662
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,183
<i>She just wants you
to be obedient.</i>

663
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,018
She's not a bad person.

664
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,020
Not if you want to be
a slave to drugs.

665
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,155
Just say "no."
I do.

666
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:41,057
<i>Check it out.</i>

667
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:43,192
<i>A crocodile killed
a motherfucking antelope.</i>

668
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,327
It's a gnu.

669
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,629
Oh, yes, of course.

670
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:48,898
Are you gonna
kill someone else?

671
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,434
Me? No.
Of course not.

672
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:54,503
Sick, disturbed cat.

673
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,038
<i>Why not, Jer?</i>

674
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,907
-<i> We both know</i>
<i>you want to.</i>
- No.

675
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,642
<i>You killed by accident.
That felt good.</i>

676
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:01,878
<i>Now do it on purpose,
Jerry.</i>

677
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,112
<i>Just once.</i>

678
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:04,614
- <i> See what it's like.</i>
- Shut up.

679
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:07,316
I don't have to listen to you.
You're just a cat.

680
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:09,585
Well, a cat that can
talk and reason.

681
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,287
That's a miracle
for the ages.

682
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,122
So what?

683
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:15,224
<i>But a guy who
talks to his cat...</i>

684
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,627
<i>well, that's one step away
from the loony bin.</i>

685
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:19,262
<i>Find someone else,
kill them,</i>

686
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:21,530
and you'll discover
what it feels like

687
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:24,600
to be truly alive.

688
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:27,270
- By killing?
- It's better than sex.

689
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,972
He is wrong.

690
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:32,608
We're not like
the pussy, Jerry.
We have morals.

691
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,111
- That's a good boy.
- Did you hear that?

692
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:37,113
I earned the right
to be called a good boy.

693
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:39,682
You earned the right
to be hit by a mini-van.

694
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,595
Knock, knock.

695
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,064
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Lisa.

696
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,566
What's up, big guy?

697
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,969
I was over here.

698
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:02,451
Just thought I'd see
what you're up to.

699
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:08,177
I'm trying to figure out
how to get out of here early.

700
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,512
Early?

701
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:12,214
Shoot, man.
It's past 5:00 now.

702
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:13,482
Oh.

703
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,955
- Do you wanna get a drink?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

704
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,691
You wanna go
to TGI Fridays?

705
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:23,559
Fridays kind of sucks
on Tuesdays.

706
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:24,593
We could go
to David's, though.

707
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:25,728
It's cool.
You'll really like it.

708
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,097
- Good. Yeah.
- Okay.

709
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,534
You wanna... now?

710
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,270
- Yeah, now.
- Yeah.

711
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:36,038
Yeah.
If you're ready, I'll...

712
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:48,718
The divorce was final
in September or something.

713
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,720
I mean, it went,
like, really quickly

714
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:53,990
because I basically
agreed to everything.

715
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:57,026
You know, he got the house
and the car and I got the cat.

716
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,194
What kind of cat?

717
00:49:58,196 --> 00:50:01,030
Um, I don't know.

718
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,565
Like a black and white.

719
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,600
It's a rescue.
It's cute.

720
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:07,169
Are you good with cats?

721
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,771
No, the real question
is are cats good with me?

722
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:11,540
Because
they pretty much own us,
not the other way around.

723
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,542
Oh, my God, yeah.

724
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:15,378
- Right?
- <i> You've got that right.</i>

725
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,514
Yeah, I mean,
if I don't give my cat
everything he wants,

726
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:19,682
it's just like,
watch out.

727
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:22,118
Yeah, yeah. Me, too!
Me, too. Me, too.

728
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,588
Yeah, I tried switching
to dry cat food.

729
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,124
He was not having it.
He tore up my couch.

730
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:29,625
- <i> No.</i>
- I know.

731
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,160
- Serves me right, though.
- They're very demanding, huh?

732
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,695
Yeah.

733
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,031
- What's your cat's name?
- Mr. Whiskers.

734
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,299
And he is a son of a bitch.

735
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,268
- How about you?
- Pig Head.

736
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,736
- 'Cause...

737
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,472
...that's what he is...
a pig head.

738
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,207
- Oh.
- Pig Head.

739
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,743
- He's so cute, though.
Do you wanna meet him?
- Yeah.

740
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:50,679
He's probably tearing up
my apartment right now.

741
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,681
Oh, now?

742
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:55,217
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

743
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,386
O-okay.

744
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,588
Uh, yeah, okay,
if you're okay to drive.

745
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,223
I'm just gonna go
to the bathroom.

746
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,225
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

747
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,591
I'm not, um,

748
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:38,127
in the habit of...

749
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:40,763
going home with somebody
after one date, you know.

750
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,631
I... but...

751
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:45,668
um, sometimes you just
gotta say, "what the hell,"
I guess.

752
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:50,206
Yeah, you just gotta
cut loose.

753
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,508
Oh, actually, I'm...
I'm that way, actually.

754
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,376
Can we go...
can we go somewhere else?

755
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:56,479
Where?
- It's a surprise.

756
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,506
Where are we?

757
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:25,948
This is where
I grew up.

758
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,611
It's beautiful.

759
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,146
You think so?

760
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:33,182
Yeah, this is so romantic.
What did you guys grow?

761
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:35,651
Hah. Nothing.

762
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,353
My stepdad had big plans,

763
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:41,190
but he was gone
all the time with the Army.

764
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:45,361
- And my mom...
well, she pretty much...
- What was she like?

765
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:46,395
Uh, German.

766
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:51,700
Beautiful...

767
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:53,402
but mostly sad.

768
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,907
Why was she sad?

769
00:52:57,909 --> 00:53:00,576
He made her choose
between leaving him

770
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,912
and leaving Berlin.

771
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:05,754
She spent
the rest of her life
homesick.

772
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,684
You okay?

773
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,188
Huh.

774
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,689
That was
my favorite window.

775
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,651
I spent
a lot of time there.

776
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,827
You didn't have
any friends?

777
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,563
No, not really.

778
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:22,264
They called...
the kids called me

779
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:23,899
"Gesundheit"
and "Fahrvergnügen"

780
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:27,236
and the "The Ultimate
Crying Machine."

781
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:30,206
- Kids are cruel.
- I know.

782
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,909
I used to...
I used to sit there

783
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:37,479
and I would
look up at the...
at the night sky

784
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:40,749
and I'd make believe that
the stars were my friends.

785
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:43,886
That's stupid, huh?

786
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,288
- No, it's sweet.
- Oh.

787
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,394
They're coming for me,
Jerry.

788
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,897
I'll...
I'll stop them.

789
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,633
It's too late.

790
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:32,968
They already know.
I told them.

791
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,903
What...
what did you tell them?

792
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,975
I told them
that sometimes I can hear

793
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,745
the secret conversations
of the world.

794
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,047
Things no one else hears.

795
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,450
The animals...

796
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,954
the angels talking to me.

797
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,857
Sometimes I hear them,
too, Mom.

798
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,360
I know you do, Jerry.

799
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,333
Never tell anyone.

800
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:06,935
I told them
and they won't let me alone.

801
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:08,771
Promise me you'll never tell.

802
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:10,973
- Promise.
- I-I promise.

803
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,508
<i>Never.</i>

804
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,543
They don't understand.

805
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,679
They<i> can't</i> understand.

806
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,552
What's that sound?

807
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:30,392
It's the hospital people...

808
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:32,354
and they have the sheriff
with them.

809
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:37,032
- I can't go back.
I can't go back.

810
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:40,102
I can't go back.
I can't go back.

811
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,440
I can't go back.

812
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,759
Finish it.

813
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:05,394
Finish it.

814
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:07,062
Finish it, please.

815
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,367
Jerry, finish it,
please.

816
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,069
Please.

817
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,807
Please, Jerry...

818
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,409
finish it, please.

819
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,387
Jerry.

820
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,391
What is it?

821
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:42,564
My... my mom... my mom died
up in that room.

822
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,807
- Sorry... I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

823
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:52,941
Hey.

824
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,012
It's okay.

825
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:07,689
It's just...
I'm s... sad.

826
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:32,448
Take me home...

827
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,008
Hey.

828
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,510
Thanks.

829
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:40,682
That was
a wonderful night, Jerry.

830
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,618
I think so, too.

831
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,689
I'm really glad
you asked me out.

832
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,158
- Me, too.

833
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,727
You're so mysterious,
you know.

834
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,864
The first time
you came up to Accounting

835
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,066
I could tell
there was something
deep about you.

836
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:00,969
Hmm.

837
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,874
You seem
a million miles away.

838
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,043
What's on your mind?

839
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,245
This night
turned out differently
than I was expecting.

840
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,652
- Different good?
- Definitely.

841
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:21,657
- I don't feel alone.
- Me, neither.

842
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,294
We have to get going.

843
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,964
Work. Oh.

844
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:30,232
- Yeah. I know.
- Oh.

845
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,167
It seems like the last thing
I wanna think about.

846
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:34,202
I know.
I gotta go home
and feed my cat and dog.

847
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:35,871
They're gonna be
furious with me.

848
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:37,272
- Do you want me
to give you a ride?
- No, it's okay.

849
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:39,107
- I'll walk.
- Yeah?

850
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,709
Yeah. Come up
to Accounting later.

851
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:42,210
Just pretend you're
delivering something.

852
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:43,779
We can make out
in the copy room.

853
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:45,781
- I'll try.
- Okay.

854
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:47,716
- Bye.
- Bye.

855
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,852
- <i> Bye.</i>
- Bye.

856
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,809
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

857
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:15,844
- I want to smell
her crotch, Jer.
- Come, here. Hey, sit.

858
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:19,181
Where the fuck's my food,
fuck face?

859
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,717
Aw, I had the best night
of my whole life.

860
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:22,918
Mwah!

861
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,886
<i>Who's a good boy?</i>

862
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:27,189
Yeah.
Oh. Oh.

863
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:31,059
Food.

864
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:32,694
Hey, Mr. Whiskers.

865
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:34,997
<i>Food. Now.</i>

866
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:39,201
I left you a little gift
on the sofa.

867
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:41,870
<i>A reminder why you can't
leave us alone without food.</i>

868
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,885
Jerry.

869
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:58,220
Hey.

870
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:00,255
Get me a friend!

871
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:04,159
- What am I supposed to do?
- <i> I do not know.</i>

872
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:07,996
- <i> Pretend everything's fine.</i>
- Really?

873
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,198
<i>Well, it got you this far,
didn't it?</i>

874
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,000
I guess so.

875
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:37,159
- Hey, Jerry?
- What?

876
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:39,227
They need you
up in Accounting.

877
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:40,328
Some problem
with payroll
or something.

878
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,164
Okay.

879
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:48,770
I found some irregularities
in your records.

880
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:50,072
We need to do an audit.

881
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:51,707
- What?
- Come on.

882
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,211
- Close the door.
- Close the door.

883
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:58,714
Come here.

884
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,283
Oh.

885
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,722
Oh.

886
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:08,857
Oh, thanks, Jerry.
Jerry was just, uh...

887
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:12,027
he just faxed...
uh, fixed the copier.

888
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,228
I can make a copy later.

889
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,764
I gotta...
I'm gonna go.

890
01:02:15,766 --> 01:02:17,065
Okay.

891
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:26,241
- Lisa, you dog.
- Woof, woof.

892
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,009
Hey, are you
still doing payroll?

893
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:31,012
Yeah, I'm a payroll lifer.
Why?

894
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,314
Can you give me
Jerry's address?

895
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:34,382
I wanna bring him
a gift or something.

896
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:35,884
Like a whoopie cake.
It's nothing.

897
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:38,754
Or you could just ask him.

898
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:41,223
I want it to be a surprise.

899
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:42,491
Please?

900
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:49,498
That's a lot
of cheese sandwiches
to eat in one sitting. 41?

901
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,134
<i>And that tiny Sonya Thomas
always wins.</i>

902
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:53,802
<i>And now a grimmer story.</i>

903
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:55,337
A woman murdered...

904
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:58,140
<i>her partial remains
dumped in the woods.</i>

905
01:02:58,142 --> 01:03:00,142
- So sad.
- So terrible.

906
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:01,543
Reporter Sheila Hammer

907
01:03:01,545 --> 01:03:03,879
<i>has an Action One News
exclusive.</i>

908
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:06,348
The grisly discovery Tuesday
near Milton

909
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:09,217
of an unidentified
female stabbing victim

910
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,520
has local police on the hunt
for a serial killer.

911
01:03:11,522 --> 01:03:13,121
Jerry,
you're a serial killer.

912
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,422
- Sheriff Weinbacher.
- No, he isn't.

913
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:16,458
- Shh!
- Now, with the aid
of the FBI

914
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,461
we have developed a profile
of the unknown killer.

915
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:22,430
Male, late 20s
or early 30s,

916
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,232
white,
lower-middle class.

917
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:26,301
- <i> Trouble fitting in.</i>
- That's you, Jerry.

918
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,103
- Can I have an autograph?
<i>- Shh!</i>

919
01:03:28,105 --> 01:03:30,972
Will he kill again?

920
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,475
Well,
if he's not stopped soon,
every indication is...

921
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,977
<i>he will kill again.</i>

922
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,846
You hear that, punk?

923
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:38,980
No, no, no.
No, no.

924
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,515
- You're a killer.
- Oh, my God.

925
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:42,350
- A serial killer!
- I don't wanna be a killer.

926
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:45,854
Too late, shitbag!
There's no turning back.

927
01:03:45,856 --> 01:03:48,590
You're a stone-cold
murdering maniac!

928
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,163
<i>Told you so.</i>
- Told me so what?

929
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,199
Well, I told you
you like killing.

930
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:59,601
And now the cops,
they say the same thing.

931
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,403
<i>Jerry.</i>

932
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:05,574
<i>Jerry.</i>

933
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,112
<i>Jerry.</i>

934
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,015
What are they saying
about you, love?

935
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,852
- That I'm a killer.
- Take me out.

936
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:19,287
Let's talk about it.

937
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,957
What if I am?

938
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:24,192
- Serial killer?
- Yeah.

939
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,294
Well, is it something
that you are...

940
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,363
like being brown-eyed
or right-handed...

941
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:31,399
or is it something
that you choose,

942
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:32,934
<i>like being an accountant?</i>

943
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:34,269
I wish I knew.

944
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:35,937
You can still make
the choice, Jerry.

945
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:37,472
You're still a good man.

946
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:41,076
Well, I try to be a good man.
I wanna be a good man.

947
01:04:41,078 --> 01:04:43,445
- Then there's the cat.
- Fuck you, blaming it on me.

948
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:45,280
Hold... hold...
hold on a second.

949
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:48,350
Look, I know
what is good.
I know.

950
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:50,452
I-I wanna lead
a righteous and just life.

951
01:04:50,454 --> 01:04:52,387
I wanna be
an upstanding member
of the community.

952
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,891
But, I mean,
you know, Mr. Whiskers,
he makes me do bad things.

953
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:58,460
The cat was nowhere near
when you killed me, Jerry.

954
01:04:58,462 --> 01:05:01,129
See? See?
Thank you, lady-head.

955
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:03,064
Okay, first of all,
not true.

956
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:06,167
Second of all, I know
right from wrong, okay?

957
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:09,537
I know it.
I try to be good.

958
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:11,339
But then certain...

959
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:17,913
horrible things happen
and I'm filled with...

960
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:21,116
with terror and dread,
standing outside of myself.

961
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:24,386
Even though I<i> know</i>
what I've done,

962
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:28,390
I also feel like...
like it wasn't me.

963
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:32,227
Pretty complicated
inside the human mind, huh?

964
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:34,930
It was you
that killed me, Jerry.

965
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,531
- You.
- Okay, that's true,

966
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:39,467
but in a certain sense,
it wasn't me.

967
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:41,703
It was, uh...

968
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:44,506
- You gonna say it was me?
- No, I wasn't gonna say that.

969
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:46,074
<i>- Oh, oh, all right.
- Devil's ad-vo-cat.</i>

970
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:47,575
Let's say it was me...

971
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,011
but, you know that
I'm a talking cat.

972
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:51,346
There's no such thing.

973
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:54,549
Everything I say
is really you.

974
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,351
It's true, buddy.
It's all you.

975
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:58,253
- What?
<i>- Come on, Jer.</i>

976
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,354
You know that.

977
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:02,390
Your pets are spot-on,
Jerry.

978
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:06,161
I kind of suspected that.

979
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,265
But if there's me,

980
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:12,600
the regular me,
standing here,

981
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:14,602
the me who's talking now,

982
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:17,038
and... and...

983
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,340
and I wanna be good...

984
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:20,675
then there's you,
you, and you

985
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:22,877
trying to make me be
something else.

986
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,014
Am I good?

987
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:28,149
No. You're bad.

988
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:29,751
She's wrong.
You're a good boy.

989
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:32,420
They're both wrong.
You are what you are.

990
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:35,256
That's it.

991
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,425
I am...

992
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:42,464
<i>Someone's here!</i>
<i>Intruder! Intruder!</i>
- Bosco, Bosco.

993
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:45,166
I got your back, Jerry.
I got your back, Jerry.

994
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,768
- I got your back Jerry.
- Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay.

995
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,604
Just a second.
Just trying to put my dog away.

996
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:51,506
Hey, Jerry,
is that my new friend?

997
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,444
Oh, Jerry, I just need
a whiff of her butt.

998
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:58,279
- Jerry.
- Shh.

999
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:00,181
Oh, Jerry!

1000
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,453
- Hey, Lisa.
- <i> Hi, Jerry.</i>

1001
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,325
Um, surprise.
Sorry.

1002
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:12,160
No, I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm so glad that you came.

1003
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:13,795
No, no.
I'm imposing.
I can tell.

1004
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:15,697
- Oh. You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1005
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,333
Um, I brought you
some cakes.

1006
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:23,071
You're amazing.
Thank you for this.

1007
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:24,506
There's four of them.

1008
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,109
Sorry, if...
do you have company?

1009
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:30,078
Or am I interrupting?

1010
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,746
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

1011
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:35,116
Yeah... I... it's just that
what you heard is, um...

1012
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:37,218
that I... sometimes
I talk to my pets.

1013
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,687
- A lot of the time.
- No, me, too.

1014
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:41,222
All the time.

1015
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,559
And they sometimes
talk to me sometimes.

1016
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,594
- I get that.
- Yeah?

1017
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:49,230
- Thank you for the cake.
- Are you locked out?

1018
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,832
Uh, it's okay.

1019
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:53,735
I'll figure out
how to get in somehow.

1020
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:57,105
You don't need
to stay around.

1021
01:07:57,107 --> 01:08:00,408
And how are you gonna get in?

1022
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,444
There's a skylight.

1023
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:04,612
I can totally get in
through the skylight.

1024
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:06,381
Really?

1025
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:09,350
You know, I...
I'm pretty good
at getting in places.

1026
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:11,119
I lose my keys
all the time, so...

1027
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:13,154
I'm gonna use the skylight.

1028
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,857
Oh.

1029
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:30,472
Jerry?
You okay?

1030
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:33,108
<i>Um, fine!
How are you?</i>

1031
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,776
Fine.

1032
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:38,146
Jerry, I'm... um...

1033
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:39,514
Jerry, I'm gonna
just... okay.

1034
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:40,882
<i>Okay.
Bye, Lisa!</i>

1035
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:42,550
<i>Thanks for stopping by.</i>

1036
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:52,875
Jerry, I got it open.

1037
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:57,765
Ooh! Hey.

1038
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,400
Hey, buddy.

1039
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,902
- Oh.

1040
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:03,171
Hey, Jerry?
Jerry!

1041
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:05,373
Uh... come on.
Come on.

1042
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,674
No, no, no.
I don't wanna play.

1043
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:08,843
- Come on.

1044
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:10,645
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1045
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,480
Okay, good boy.
Good boy.

1046
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,748
Lisa.

1047
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,750
I-I told you I was gonna
go through the skylight.

1048
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:24,285
Jerry, I'm sorry.

1049
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:26,287
- Why... why would you...
- I apologize.

1050
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:28,289
...go through
the door like that?

1051
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:29,624
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

1052
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:31,593
- I'm just gonna go home.
- No, no, no, no.

1053
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:34,229
Please, please.
Please, please stay.
It's okay, it's okay.

1054
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:37,832
She... she's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1055
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:39,367
She's the best.

1056
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,835
Jerry,
who are you talking to?

1057
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:42,537
No, no.

1058
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:45,006
Wait, wait.

1059
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,976
No!
No! No! No!

1060
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:49,510
- Jerry, I'm just gonna go.
- No, I'm not gonna...

1061
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:51,546
I'm not gonna hurt her.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1062
01:10:51,548 --> 01:10:52,847
I'm not...
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1063
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:54,349
It's fine.
It's fine.

1064
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:56,251
It's...

1065
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:58,486
- They're really
gonna hate me.
- No...

1066
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:01,408
No, no, Lisa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1067
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,558
Lisa. Hey.

1068
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,561
- Lisa, plea... please.

1069
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,631
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1070
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:10,932
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?</i>

1071
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:15,670
Please, open the door.

1072
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:19,607
- No!

1073
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,510
<i>No!
Lisa, come on!</i>

1074
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:24,512
She won't...

1075
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,620
Ow!

1076
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,923
- Lisa.

1077
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:42,730
Ow.

1078
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,574
Lisa?

1079
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,711
I'm... I'm gonna
come in now, okay?

1080
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,900
I am so, so sorry.

1081
01:12:18,902 --> 01:12:21,769
Jerry,
I won't tell anyone.

1082
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:24,439
I... I wish
that you didn't
have to see that.

1083
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:25,940
I just wish
that we could go back

1084
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:27,742
<i>to the beginning,
you know?</i>

1085
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:30,345
We can.

1086
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:31,646
We can.

1087
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,950
I'm really sorry.

1088
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:37,485
No, I'm sorry.

1089
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:40,054
I'm sorry
I got scared earlier.

1090
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:41,723
I know.
That was scary.

1091
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:43,424
I didn't...

1092
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:44,559
I didn't mean to...
to scare you.

1093
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,527
It's okay.

1094
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,136
I'm fine now.

1095
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:57,638
I know, I know.
I know.

1096
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,608
You hit me so hard.

1097
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:03,111
No, it's okay.

1098
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,493
Oh, are you okay?

1099
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:22,130
Oh, God, I don't know
how that happened.

1100
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,501
- I'm so sorry.
- Jerry...

1101
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:30,805
I-I wanna go home.

1102
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:35,977
Jerry.

1103
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,787
<i>It's okay.
It's okay.</i>

1104
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:47,688
<i>I know you're suffering.</i>

1105
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,657
<i>I'm gonna help you.</i>

1106
01:14:24,727 --> 01:14:26,894
Shite.

1107
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:29,897
You did what you
had to do, Jerry.

1108
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:32,567
Figure it out
in the morning.

1109
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:33,835
Meow.

1110
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,972
Oh, it's okay, buddy.

1111
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,507
Everything's...

1112
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:43,511
Everything's gonna be okay.

1113
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:44,846
You're a good boy.

1114
01:14:44,848 --> 01:14:46,714
Woof.

1115
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:47,982
Woof.

1116
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,855
<i>What?</i>

1117
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:58,025
You want a piece, huh?

1118
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:00,194
Wha... huh?

1119
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:01,762
What?
Want some of this?

1120
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:03,231
Hah!

1121
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,007
What?

1122
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,919
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name,

1123
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:26,254
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

1124
01:15:26,256 --> 01:15:27,788
on earth as it is in heaven.

1125
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,690
Make Jerry and Mr. Whiskers
and Bosco good boys.

1126
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,226
<i>Amen.</i>

1127
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:35,596
<i>Hey, Lisa, sweetie,</i>

1128
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:38,232
maybe give me a call
or a text when you get this?

1129
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:39,767
Hope you're okay.

1130
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:41,736
I can't reach her,
either.

1131
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:44,605
Are you guys watching
the video of the baby
peeing on the senator?

1132
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:48,109
No email,
no Facebook updates.

1133
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:51,012
She was going out
with that Jerry guy
from Packing and Shipping.

1134
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:54,115
- I can't reach him, either.
- Jerry the pizza guy?

1135
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:56,717
- God he's weird.
- You've heard the rumors,
right?

1136
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,952
No.

1137
01:15:57,954 --> 01:16:00,274
Go to the "Tri State
Herald" website.

1138
01:16:02,257 --> 01:16:06,060
July 9th, 1997.
Front page.

1139
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,236
Oh.

1140
01:16:57,245 --> 01:17:00,381
<i>Intruder! Intruder!</i>

1141
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:01,916
<i>I'll take the bullet
for you, Jerry.</i>

1142
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:03,784
<i>I'll take
the bullet for you, Jerry.</i>

1143
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,720
- Oh, oh!
<i>- Don't pee yourself.</i>

1144
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:08,189
It's not the dog catcher,
unfortunately.

1145
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:11,158
Shh.
What do we do?

1146
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,794
Oh, Jerry.
I got an idea.

1147
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,005
Hi, Jerry.

1148
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:25,106
Hi, Alison.

1149
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:42,123
- Hey, Jerry?
- Yeah?

1150
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,425
<i>You remember last week
when, uh... when you...</i>

1151
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:46,227
when you said
there was an invisible line

1152
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:47,662
that separates
good from evil,

1153
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:49,330
and you thought
you'd crossed it.

1154
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,298
<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>You're a good boy"?</i>

1155
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,333
Yeah, I remember.
So what?

1156
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,035
I've changed my opinion.

1157
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:58,272
So you think
I'm evil, Bosco?

1158
01:17:58,274 --> 01:17:59,740
I'm certain of it.

1159
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:05,946
Welcome to my world,
Jerry.

1160
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:08,082
I don't wanna be
a part of your world.

1161
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:09,950
<i>You're already there.</i>

1162
01:18:09,952 --> 01:18:11,752
<i>Become what
you're meant to become.</i>

1163
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,822
Fiona?

1164
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:16,724
What do you think
I should do?

1165
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,162
Well, you can't
go back to work.

1166
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:23,431
Can't stay here, either.

1167
01:18:23,433 --> 01:18:25,266
I think it's time
to see if the cat

1168
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:27,802
knows what
he's talking about.

1169
01:18:27,804 --> 01:18:30,071
- She's right.
- I totally agree.

1170
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:32,273
Well, meow to that.

1171
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:33,741
Just go around
killing people?

1172
01:18:33,743 --> 01:18:34,942
I like people.

1173
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:37,945
Aye.
Fuck the dog.

1174
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:39,980
Do it for the pleasure
it brings.

1175
01:18:39,982 --> 01:18:42,149
<i>Come on, Jerry.</i>

1176
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:43,451
<i>We'll get a bigger fridge.</i>

1177
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:45,186
<i>The first five
are always the hardest.</i>

1178
01:18:45,188 --> 01:18:47,188
<i>Don't listen to him, Jerry.</i>

1179
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:48,989
<i>I don't know about you girls,
but that Jerry guy...</i>

1180
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,858
<i>And he's going crazy.
He's losing it.</i>

1181
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:54,295
<i>He's in a troubled place
right now.</i>

1182
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:56,130
- - Hey, that's my boy.
You can do it.

1183
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:16,083
Shut up!

1184
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:30,431
Hi.

1185
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,433
<i>Jerry.</i>

1186
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,470
I got a lot
going on right now.

1187
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:39,173
What happened?

1188
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:42,309
Well, um,
I've been crying a lot.

1189
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:44,178
All the time.

1190
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,413
And I stopped
taking the drugs.

1191
01:19:46,415 --> 01:19:48,849
What? Why?

1192
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:50,351
The cat made me do it.

1193
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:53,320
Your cat made you?

1194
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:56,023
Mm-hmm.
No, no, kind of.

1195
01:19:56,025 --> 01:19:58,025
I mean,
Mr.... Mr. Whiskers
does the talking,

1196
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,860
but it's really me.

1197
01:19:59,862 --> 01:20:01,362
See?
I'm making progress.

1198
01:20:01,364 --> 01:20:03,197
It's not the cat.
I know that now.

1199
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,866
Jerry,
we had an agreement.

1200
01:20:05,868 --> 01:20:08,149
<i>I know.
I'm sorry.</i>

1201
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,405
Dr. Warren,
I'm a bad person.

1202
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:14,175
<i>Don't be so hard
on yourself.</i>

1203
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:16,443
<i>I appreciate your honesty.</i>

1204
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,847
I'm disappointed,

1205
01:20:19,849 --> 01:20:23,150
but, hey, it's not like
you killed someone.

1206
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:26,020
Um...

1207
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:27,488
<i>What, Jerry?</i>

1208
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,491
It... uh, it is
kinda like that.

1209
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,460
Kinda like that
times three.

1210
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:39,533
What are you saying, Jerry?

1211
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:43,337
Three peo... three people
who aren't alive anymore
because of me.

1212
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:47,341
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. I know.

1213
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,376
I feel terrible about it.

1214
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:51,979
And I... I really need
your help right now.

1215
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,216
- I'll help you, Jerry.
- Thank you.

1216
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,951
Go ahead.
I'm listening.

1217
01:20:56,953 --> 01:20:58,886
Oh...

1218
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:03,123
Okay, you remem...
you know the conga line?

1219
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,526
At your company party.

1220
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,628
- <i> Yeah.</i>
- Yeah.

1221
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,466
Uh, everyb... everybody sang
"Happy Song."

1222
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:15,402
<i>And you know
that English girl Fiona?</i>

1223
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:19,106
<i>We congaed and</i>
<i>we were supposed</i>
<i>to go to Shi Shan...</i>

1224
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:22,509
see an awesome show and...

1225
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:24,144
What are you doing,
Dr. Warren?

1226
01:21:24,146 --> 01:21:25,446
- Give me that.
- No!

1227
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:28,916
- I'm being held!
- It was an accident!

1228
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:31,652
I liked all of them
and I wish they were all alive.

1229
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:33,387
But there's nothing
that I can do about that now.

1230
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:36,257
- Do you have packing tape?
- What? Why?

1231
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:38,859
Because I can't
let you go and I still
need a lot of therapy.

1232
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,230
No, stay there!
You stay there now!

1233
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:46,467
- Back! Back!
- Jerry, you're really
upset right now.

1234
01:21:46,469 --> 01:21:48,235
Let's discuss this.

1235
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:50,037
- Okay.
- Stay calm.

1236
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:51,639
I understand.
Jerry, don't do this.

1237
01:21:51,641 --> 01:21:53,761
- Don't do this, Jerry. No.
- Shh, shh. It's okay.

1238
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:08,122
Okay, we haven't got
a lot of time,

1239
01:22:08,124 --> 01:22:09,423
so we gotta get
into the big issues.

1240
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:10,958
Do you believe in God?

1241
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,960
- Mm.
- Me, too.

1242
01:22:12,962 --> 01:22:14,461
And I totally think
that He has it out for me.

1243
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:16,130
<i>He gives...
cuts everyone else slack</i>

1244
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:17,364
and then totally craps
all over me,

1245
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:20,167
and I wanna know why.

1246
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:23,103
Why would
He put a little boy in a home
with a father like that,

1247
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,571
make my mother
lose herself so completely

1248
01:22:24,573 --> 01:22:28,242
that she'd rather die
than be with me?

1249
01:22:28,244 --> 01:22:29,944
But if He is all-knowing,

1250
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:31,645
then God must be okay
with me killing people.

1251
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:33,047
Mm-mm.

1252
01:22:33,049 --> 01:22:35,015
Ah, a shrink
who wants to talk.

1253
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:36,550
Mmm.

1254
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:38,185
But if I untape you,
we're gonna get

1255
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,521
on the fast road
to mental health, okay?

1256
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:42,423
Hey, you start doing
the silent shrink thing,

1257
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:44,058
and I can't predict
what I'll do.

1258
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,661
- Uh...
- <i> Now...</i>

1259
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:49,630
why do I hear voices?

1260
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,668
Oh, a lot of people
hear voices.

1261
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,271
Or thoughts they can't stop.

1262
01:22:57,273 --> 01:22:59,273
A lot of people?

1263
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:00,975
<i>Yeah.</i>

1264
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:03,077
It might be a voice
telling them

1265
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:05,546
they're worthless
or stupid or...

1266
01:23:05,548 --> 01:23:09,049
or it could tell them
to indulge every desire...

1267
01:23:09,051 --> 01:23:11,085
drink that drink,
take that drug,

1268
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:13,087
follow every sexual impulse.

1269
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:14,521
Or it could be
a cynical voice

1270
01:23:14,523 --> 01:23:16,390
<i>telling them
nothing matters,</i>

1271
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,525
<i>that their efforts
are insignificant.</i>

1272
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,060
You hear stuff like that?

1273
01:23:20,062 --> 01:23:23,364
Yeah.
I have thoughts.

1274
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:25,166
Not exactly
the same as you,

1275
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:28,102
<i>but similar.</i>

1276
01:23:28,104 --> 01:23:31,605
<i>They tell me that I'm fat
or psychotherapy is...</i>

1277
01:23:31,607 --> 01:23:35,576
is not a worthwhile exercise,
that... that it's not real,

1278
01:23:35,578 --> 01:23:38,645
that I should've aimed higher
than a government job,

1279
01:23:38,647 --> 01:23:41,548
that my potential
is being squandered,

1280
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:44,184
<i>that I'm unworthy of love.</i>

1281
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:48,088
But none of that's true.

1282
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,356
So what do you do about it?

1283
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:54,128
Well, I can't
shut them off entirely...

1284
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,463
nor would I want to...

1285
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:59,133
but I can argue
against them.

1286
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:00,401
Just because
you have thoughts

1287
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:02,536
doesn't mean
you have to act on them.

1288
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:08,709
You don't have
to act on them?

1289
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:11,345
<i>No.</i>

1290
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:14,214
Being alone in the world

1291
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:17,051
is the root of all suffering.

1292
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:19,153
<i>But, Jerry,</i>

1293
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:21,688
<i>you're not alone.</i>

1294
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:27,728
Whoa.

1295
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,802
See, that's like
10 years of therapy
in 10 seconds.

1296
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:44,144
- Where are we going?
- Home.

1297
01:24:44,146 --> 01:24:45,479
I gotta feed my pets.

1298
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:05,799
- All right, let's go.
- No, no, no.

1299
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:08,435
You go inside,
I'll wait here
and watch the road.

1300
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:14,641
So that if I see him coming,
I can honk the horn
and warn you,

1301
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:16,677
and then you can
run back immediately.

1302
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:18,712
You're a real hero,
John.

1303
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:38,432
Alison?

1304
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:26,914
Ah...

1305
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:31,718
John, call the police.
Call the...

1306
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,707
Mr. Whiskers?

1307
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,677
- Bosco.

1308
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:59,546
- Oh, my God, Jerry,
what have you done?
- Please be quiet.

1309
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:02,282
- Please be quiet.
- Let me go, for God's sake.

1310
01:27:02,284 --> 01:27:03,483
Mr. Whiskers?

1311
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:05,352
What are you gonna do?

1312
01:27:05,354 --> 01:27:06,653
I told you
I don't know, already.
All right?

1313
01:27:06,655 --> 01:27:10,224
- Bosco!
- What are you gonna do?

1314
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:12,593
- What are you going to do?
- I told you, I don't know.

1315
01:27:12,595 --> 01:27:14,695
My pets are missing.

1316
01:27:20,702 --> 01:27:23,637
Jerry, let me go,
for God's sake.

1317
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,307
Everything is gonna be okay.

1318
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:50,831
Mr. Whiskers?!

1319
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:52,399
Bosco?!

1320
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:55,569
Bosco?!

1321
01:28:00,743 --> 01:28:03,610
Hey, loser.
Is this the bitch
you've been fucking?

1322
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:06,647
No. No. No. No.

1323
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:08,649
Mr. Whiskers.
That is my psychotherapist.

1324
01:28:08,651 --> 01:28:10,517
Great job she's doing.

1325
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:12,352
<i>You're the picture
of mental health.</i>

1326
01:28:12,354 --> 01:28:13,920
- Where's Bosco?
- He got hit by a mini-van.

1327
01:28:13,922 --> 01:28:16,623
- I'm lost without him.
- <i> Good.</i>

1328
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:20,394
Now you can kill her without
all his pathetic yelping.

1329
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:23,964
<i>- No, no, no.
- It's okay.</i>

1330
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:25,632
It's okay.
I'm gonna just do this.

1331
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,768
Oh, God.

1332
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:30,837
- Jerry?
- Yeah.

1333
01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:33,707
- I'm scared.
- She wasn't scared last week

1334
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:35,876
when she threatened
to send you back to
the loony bin.

1335
01:28:35,878 --> 01:28:37,744
Me, too.

1336
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,882
Wha... what can I do
to make you more comfortable?

1337
01:28:41,884 --> 01:28:43,517
Huh?

1338
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:45,752
- I want to make a phone call.
- She'll call the cops.

1339
01:28:45,754 --> 01:28:48,789
- You'll call the cops.
- No, no, no, I... I...

1340
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:51,491
I just don't
want to be alone.

1341
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:55,862
Oh, oh, oh!
Stay right there.

1342
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:57,964
Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait...

1343
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:02,102
You don't have to be alone.

1344
01:29:02,104 --> 01:29:04,538
Ah, here, here, here.

1345
01:29:09,712 --> 01:29:11,745
Mr. Whiskers!
Dr. Warren!

1346
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:13,680
Fiona!
Cut it out!

1347
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:18,051
- Mr. Whiskers!

1348
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:42,142
Hey.

1349
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:45,879
You did the best
that you could.

1350
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:48,415
It's not your fault.

1351
01:29:48,417 --> 01:29:51,051
What are you gonna
do to me?

1352
01:29:51,053 --> 01:29:52,886
N-nothing.

1353
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:55,155
Nothing.
It's... it's fine.

1354
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:06,733
Put me the fuck down,
you goddamn psycho.

1355
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,535
I'll shit in your hand.

1356
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:12,172
<i>The suspect's car is
in the parking lot.</i>

1357
01:30:12,174 --> 01:30:13,740
- Here. Here.
- <i> I want you two on the right.</i>

1358
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:15,942
Fan out and spread around
the building.

1359
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:18,478
- Cover all exits.
- All right, keep low, guys.

1360
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,415
-<i> Keep low.</i>
-<i> Watch, around the back,</i>
<i>around the back.</i>

1361
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,726
Ahh!

1362
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:38,932
<i>Is this your brilliant
escape plan, Jerry?</i>

1363
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,934
<i>Sneak out the back door.</i>

1364
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,636
<i>It's your favorite door,
isn't it?</i>

1365
01:30:42,638 --> 01:30:43,918
It's the best I've got.

1366
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:55,115
<i>This'll fool 'em</i>
<i>since you're bulletproof</i>
<i>and invisible.</i>

1367
01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:59,553
<i>Run, Jerry.</i>

1368
01:30:59,555 --> 01:31:01,488
<i>It's been nice
knowing you, pal.</i>

1369
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:21,541
- Sheriff's department.
<i>- I'm here.</i>

1370
01:31:21,543 --> 01:31:23,743
- Nobody move.
- <i> Don't hurt me!</i>

1371
01:31:23,745 --> 01:31:25,679
I smell gas.

1372
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:30,150
- Can't you smell that?
- We'll check on it.

1373
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:32,552
- Where'd Jerry go?
- He went in there.

1374
01:31:32,554 --> 01:31:35,555
Suspect last seen
in the bathroom.

1375
01:31:35,557 --> 01:31:38,158
- Was he armed?
- I don't know.

1376
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:40,660
<i>I found a cat.</i>

1377
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:45,765
- <i>- Come in here.</i>

1378
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:57,911
<i>Jerry.</i>

1379
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:02,716
<i>Hey, we found a cat
and a dog.</i>

1380
01:32:02,718 --> 01:32:04,551
<i>Call the animal shelter.</i>

1381
01:32:04,553 --> 01:32:06,753
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

1382
01:32:06,755 --> 01:32:08,622
We believe
he's in the bowling alley.

1383
01:32:08,624 --> 01:32:09,990
- You think he's armed?
- I don't know.

1384
01:32:09,992 --> 01:32:13,827
- Then we have to assume he is.
- Please don't hurt him.

1385
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:15,262
He's very ill.

1386
01:32:15,264 --> 01:32:18,031
Our first priority
is our own safety, Doctor.

1387
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:26,273
Tactical team on scene.

1388
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:28,675
First responders... clear.

1389
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:30,277
Bedroom... clear.

1390
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:39,753
- Go! Go!
- Preparing to descend.

1391
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:44,124
Gas leak!

1392
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:55,302
<i>- Jerry.
- Jerry.</i>

1393
01:32:55,304 --> 01:32:57,671
<i>Jerry, you're almost home.</i>

1394
01:32:57,673 --> 01:32:59,973
<i>Come home, Jerry.</i>

1395
01:32:59,975 --> 01:33:02,042
<i>Come, come with us.</i>

1396
01:33:02,044 --> 01:33:05,812
<i>- Jerry.
- Come, Jerry.</i>

1397
01:33:05,814 --> 01:33:08,582
<i>We're all waiting
for you.</i>

1398
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:11,251
<i>Come.</i>
<i>You'll never</i>
<i>be alone anymore.</i>

1399
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:13,687
<i>Come home, come.</i>

1400
01:33:13,689 --> 01:33:16,122
<i>You'll never
be alone anymore.</i>

1401
01:33:16,124 --> 01:33:18,625
<i>Jerry, come with us.</i>

1402
01:33:35,677 --> 01:33:39,145
<i>As in you're gonna be
charbroiled, Jerry.</i>

1403
01:33:39,147 --> 01:33:41,147
<i>- You run.</i>
<i> No.</i>

1404
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:43,149
<i>You stay.</i>

1405
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:45,852
<i>You're no good to yourself
or anybody else.</i>

1406
01:33:45,854 --> 01:33:47,354
<i>You let the fire
put you to sleep.</i>

1407
01:33:47,356 --> 01:33:51,691
<i>Isn't that what they say
right before they kill you?</i>

1408
01:33:51,693 --> 01:33:52,993
<i>Jerry knows that.</i>

1409
01:33:52,995 --> 01:33:55,195
<i>He can end
the suffering tonight.</i>

1410
01:33:55,197 --> 01:33:56,997
<i>- Unless you want to be
- Jerry The Human Torch,</i>

1411
01:33:56,999 --> 01:33:58,865
<i>get the hell out.</i>

1412
01:33:58,867 --> 01:34:01,167
<i>Stand your ground, buddy.</i>

1413
01:34:01,169 --> 01:34:03,870
<i>There's nothing left
for you in this life.</i>

1414
01:34:19,353 --> 01:34:22,822
<i>We could've filled 10 more
refrigerators, Jerry.</i>

1415
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:24,858
<i>Shush, pussy.</i>

1416
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,160
<i>If he survives,</i>
<i>he'll only cause</i>
<i>more suffering,</i>

1417
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,162
<i>pain, and death.</i>

1418
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,331
<i>It's over.</i>

1419
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:32,832
<i>Jerry's going home.</i>

1420
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:50,316
You win, pup.

1421
01:34:50,318 --> 01:34:51,785
I have to confess...

1422
01:34:51,787 --> 01:34:54,954
this alpha thing
suits you well.

1423
01:34:54,956 --> 01:34:57,223
I kind of like you,
Bosco.

1424
01:34:57,225 --> 01:34:59,959
Me, too.

1425
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:03,229
I like you,
Mr. Whiskers.

1426
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:06,066
But now it's time
for each of us to go
our own way.

1427
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:09,369
Good-bye, friend.

1428
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:10,970
Good-bye, Mr. Whiskers.

1429
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:25,218
- Mom?
- Hey, Jerry.

1430
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:27,187
- Dad?
- Creep.

1431
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:29,823
Hey, Fiona, Lisa.

1432
01:35:29,825 --> 01:35:31,545
- Good evening, love.
- Hi, Jerry.

1433
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:36,796
- Mmm... Alison?
- Hey, Jerry.

1434
01:35:36,798 --> 01:35:38,932
I'm sorry
I killed you guys.

1435
01:35:38,934 --> 01:35:40,300
Let's not bring up
the bad things.

1436
01:35:40,302 --> 01:35:42,068
Let's just be happy.

1437
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,943
Jesus.

1438
01:35:49,945 --> 01:35:51,277
Hi, Jerry.

1439
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:53,413
Thanks for the love
and thank you for coming.

1440
01:35:53,415 --> 01:35:55,815
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1441
01:35:55,817 --> 01:35:58,384
- Are my pets gonna be okay?
- You betcha.
