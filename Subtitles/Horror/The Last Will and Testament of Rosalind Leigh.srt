00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:35,601
( Wordless
vocalizing )

2
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:53,172
Woman: <i>Sometimes,</i>
<i>late at night,</i>

3
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:57,075
<i>you can still</i>
<i>feel the loneliness...</i>

4
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:02,781
<i>Like an animal</i>
<i>in the dark,</i>

5
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,984
<i>ready to pounce.</i>

6
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:09,688
<i>It can make</i>
<i>a warm memory</i>

7
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,660
<i>seem empty</i>
<i>and unfamiliar.</i>

8
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:20,832
<i>Past things</i>
<i>seem insignificant.</i>

9
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:26,939
<i>And even faith</i>
<i>can seem trivial</i>

10
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:30,209
<i>and worthless.</i>

11
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,950
<i>My dear Leon.</i>

12
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,886
<i>I remember</i>
<i>the day you were born.</i>

13
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:45,657
<i>You were</i>
<i>my little angel.</i>

14
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,861
<i>Always</i>
<i>so full of joy.</i>

15
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,634
<i>So full of life.</i>

16
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:06,878
<i>And then,</i>
<i>one day...</i>

17
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,780
( Growling sound )

18
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,916
<i>Everything changed.</i>

19
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,720
Man: Our father
who art in heaven,

20
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,088
hallowed be thy name.

21
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,823
<i>More than anyone,</i>

22
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:21,960
<i>you deserved</i>
<i>an explanation.</i>

23
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,730
<i>You needed to know</i>

24
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:29,101
<i>why your father</i>
<i>did what he did.</i>

25
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:34,006
<i>But that is</i>
<i>God's secret.</i>

26
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:40,646
<i>You were too young then,</i>
<i>too angry to accept it.</i>

27
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:46,385
<i>Too stubborn to see</i>
<i>that the soul lives on</i>

28
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:48,820
<i>long after death.</i>

29
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:53,925
<i>You closed yourself</i>
<i>away,</i>

30
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,761
<i>and as you grew,</i>

31
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:59,064
<i>i prayed that</i>
<i>your faith would return.</i>

32
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:04,036
<i>But you only became</i>
<i>more distant.</i>

33
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,809
<i>And sometimes,</i>
<i>late at night,</i>

34
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,345
<i>you still feel</i>
<i>the loneliness,</i>

35
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:20,719
<i>and you've learned that pain</i>
<i>doesn't give up that easily.</i>

36
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,357
<i>That despair is an affliction</i>
<i>of the godless.</i>

37
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,193
( Busy signal
beeping in phone )

38
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,895
<i>My dear Leon,</i>

39
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,030
<i>you are in</i>
<i>a terrible danger</i>

40
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:37,235
<i>unless you can recognize</i>
<i>that your soul lives on</i>

41
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,037
<i>long after death.</i>

42
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,308
<i>It is the only thing</i>
<i>that can save you...</i>

43
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:49,715
<i>And bring us</i>
<i>together again.</i>

44
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,179
( Phone ringing )

45
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,854
Man: <i>Hi. This is bill Phillips</i>
<i>with tribal trade.</i>

46
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,356
<i>I'm not available</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>

47
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,491
<i>Please leave a message,</i>

48
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:42,027
<i>and I'll return your call</i>
<i>within 24 hours.</i>

49
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,464
<i>Thank you for</i>
<i>using voicemail.</i>

50
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:49,000
Bill, it's Leon.
Give me a call.

51
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,301
Woman: <i>I wish we could talk</i>
<i>like we used to.</i>

52
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:04,643
<i>But once you left,</i>
<i>you never came back.</i>

53
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:10,682
<i>It's been so long</i>
<i>since you even called.</i>

54
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,189
<i>It's so hard</i>
<i>being alone.</i>

55
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,626
<i>There are always</i>
<i>strangers at the door,</i>

56
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:25,964
<i>and they always</i>
<i>want something.</i>

57
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,099
( Pounding )

58
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,637
<i>This house</i>
<i>is a holy place.</i>

59
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:47,212
<i>And even though you never</i>
<i>visited me here...</i>

60
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,718
<i>I have left behind</i>
<i>a few reminders for you.</i>

61
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,126
<i>I leave everything I have</i>

62
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:05,397
<i>to the only person</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

63
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,733
( Door closes )

64
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,436
<i>You.</i>

65
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,186
( Door hinge squeaking )

66
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:08,313
( Car starts,
drives away )

67
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:47,018
( Loud scraping sounds )

68
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,957
( Brief low growl )

69
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,588
( Leon speaking
indistinctly )

70
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,563
I spent the entire week
preparing for this,

71
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,832
and I walk in,
and it's all right here.

72
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,901
Bill: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>what to tell you, Leon.</i>

73
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,970
<i>I had strict orders</i>
<i>to buy everything you sold.</i>

74
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,640
And you didn't think
that I'd find that interesting?

75
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,075
<i>Uh, had no idea.</i>

76
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,944
You don't think
it's a little weird

77
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,313
that somebody is only
interested in items

78
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,547
from my personal
collection?

79
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,449
<i>I'm a broker,</i>
<i>you know the drill.</i>

80
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,519
<i>Confidentiality</i>
<i>is always assured.</i>

81
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,955
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>I swear,</i>

82
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,023
<i>i had no idea</i>
<i>it was your mother</i>

83
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,893
<i>who was buying up</i>
<i>all your items.</i>

84
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,929
<i>You gotta believe</i>
<i>me, Leon.</i>

85
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,465
<i>Hello?</i>

86
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,001
<i>You there?</i>

87
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,002
Yeah.

88
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,738
<i>I got enough on my mind</i>
<i>just getting the best price,</i>

89
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,441
<i>never mind keeping tabs</i>
<i>on who's buying.</i>

90
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,543
- <i>You know what</i>
<i>I'm saying?</i>
- Yeah.

91
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,679
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>you saw her anyway?</i>

92
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,949
It's been a while.

93
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:28,720
<i>I'm sorry. I know</i>
<i>it's a tough time.</i>

94
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,788
<i>Listen, if you wanna put</i>
<i>any of that stuff</i>

95
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,623
<i>back on the market,</i>
<i>just let me know, okay?</i>

96
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,893
<i>I can move it for you all over</i>
<i>again, double your take.</i>

97
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,595
Okay. Yeah.

98
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,597
Um... thanks, bill.

99
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,965
<i>Yeah. Don't mention it.</i>

100
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,735
<i>Call me if you need</i>
<i>anything, okay?</i>

101
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,603
Yeah.

102
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,640
Bye.

103
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,157
( Leon chuckles )

104
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,215
Woman: Come back here.

105
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,914
( Sharp intake
of breath )

106
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,983
( Leon gasps )

107
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,299
( Clicking light switch
on and off )

108
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,903
( Woman whispering )
<i>Believe.</i>

109
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,187
( Remote clatters
loudly )

110
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,391
<i>... angry God!</i>

111
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,960
<i>Ours is</i>
<i>a fearful God!</i>

112
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,463
<i>We have the signs.</i>

113
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,400
- <i>We have the word...</i>
- ( Volume lowers )

114
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,369
<i>Of his ministers</i>
<i>on the earth,</i>

115
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,038
<i>and by our faith,</i>
<i>we see</i>

116
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,874
<i>what the unbelievers</i>
<i>cannot.</i>

117
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,780
<i>...hosts of angels.</i>

118
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:06,851
<i>The world is full</i>
<i>of atheists,</i>

119
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,520
<i>and sinners</i>
<i>of the mind,</i>

120
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:12,957
<i>but we are</i>
<i>people of the faith...</i>

121
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,166
( Loud banging
on door )

122
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,453
Hi.

123
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,489
Man: Hello.
I'm from next door.

124
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,959
I was a good friend
of your mother.

125
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,261
Oh, hi,
I'm Leon.

126
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,129
I know
who you are.

127
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,332
She spoke about
you often.

128
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,434
We're very saddened
by what happened.

129
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:07,338
We mourned her long,
and miss her deeply.

130
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,573
Thanks. I appreciate that.

131
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,208
May I come in?

132
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,011
Now's not really
a great time, but...

133
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,480
Perhaps later then?

134
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,449
Yeah.

135
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:22,520
We are a close
community here.

136
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,122
We've had many
special moments

137
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:28,158
in this old house.

138
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,661
It is
truly blessed.

139
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:34,298
Do you believe
in angels, Leon?

140
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,568
Your mother
believed in them deeply,

141
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,969
as do we.

142
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:43,173
Perhaps you will join us
once you're settled in.

143
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:47,311
Yeah, sure.
Thanks for stopping by.

144
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,346
One more thing.

145
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:53,350
There's an animal
that's come out
of the woods.

146
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,553
It's probably sick,

147
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,389
so it might
be dangerous.

148
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,158
You should
be careful.

149
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,960
Okay, I will.

150
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,462
The woods
belong to God,

151
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,031
but every so often,

152
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:11,135
something bad
comes out of them.

153
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:13,137
Okay, I'll keep
that in mind.

154
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:17,341
Bye, Leon.
God bless you.

155
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,443
Yeah.

156
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,095
( Sighs )

157
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,600
( Thunder crashes,
rain falling )

158
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:43,520
( Cell phone ringing )

159
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,358
Anna.

160
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,493
<i>Leon, what's up?</i>

161
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:52,362
Hey. Uh, not much.
How are you?

162
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:55,365
<i>Well, I'm busy,</i>
<i>as usual.</i>

163
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,435
Yeah. Uh...

164
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,471
<i>You called.</i>

165
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:03,707
Yeah. I, uh...

166
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,579
( Laughs ) I... I can't
remember why I called.

167
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,446
Um...

168
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,882
<i>Look, I really don't</i>
<i>have time for this.</i>

169
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:15,385
Okay, no, no, no.
It's just, um...

170
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,323
I'm at
my mom's place now.

171
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:21,492
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

172
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:23,594
Yeah, it's...

173
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,295
I had no idea.

174
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,297
- Um...
- ( Anna sighs heavily )

175
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,568
Something happened that
I can't really explain.

176
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,404
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

177
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,606
Um...

178
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:40,144
You know, I was
just around and settling in,

179
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:42,613
and, uh, I left
the room for a second,

180
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,715
I came back,
and there's this statue

181
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:46,550
on the TV when
I didn't put it there.

182
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:49,920
In fact, I distinctly remember
seeing it in the basement.

183
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:53,557
<i>- And you're sure?</i>
- I'm positive.

184
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,295
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

185
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,264
How am I feeling?

186
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,266
( Laughs )
Uh...

187
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:05,602
I wanna know why
that statue's on the TV.

188
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:08,806
<i>Tunnel reality.</i>

189
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,574
Tu... what?

190
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:11,441
<i>I'm surmising,</i>

191
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,678
<i>but the statue has</i>
<i>connotations for you.</i>

192
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,947
<i>Probably not</i>
<i>positive ones.</i>

193
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,816
<i>Is that true?</i>

194
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,384
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

195
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:22,252
<i>So look, you didn't</i>
<i>see the statue,</i>

196
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,588
<i>because you didn't</i>
<i>wanna see it.</i>

197
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,256
<i>It's probably because</i>
<i>you didn't feel</i>

198
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,325
<i>emotionally ready</i>
<i>to see it, and yet,</i>

199
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,694
<i>you clearly have a need</i>
<i>to come to terms with it</i>

200
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,963
<i>since you were the one</i>
<i>that brought it up the stairs,</i>

201
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:36,567
<i>and put it in plain view</i>
<i>so that you would notice it.</i>

202
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:41,538
<i>It's the statue your mother</i>
<i>gave you, isn't it?</i>

203
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,274
Yeah, yeah.

204
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,910
<i>Same one she used</i>
<i>to punish you?</i>

205
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:49,246
It wasn't...

206
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:50,881
It was more of a test.

207
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,950
<i>No, you don't test</i>
<i>a nine-year-old boy</i>

208
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:55,319
<i>by lighting candles</i>
<i>and asking him</i>

209
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:57,387
<i>if he believes in God.</i>

210
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,423
Could've said yes.

211
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:00,691
<i>Yes, but you said no.</i>

212
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,961
<i>And then, she'd start to</i>
<i>blow out all the candles,</i>

213
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:06,897
<i>and what would she say</i>
<i>was gonna happen</i>

214
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:11,235
<i>when all the candles</i>
<i>were blown out?</i>

215
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,672
<i>Leon.</i>

216
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,274
What?

217
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,977
<i>I want to hear you</i>
<i>say it.</i>

218
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:23,881
Said the angel would
turn its back and...

219
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,250
Stop protecting me.

220
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:29,853
<i>And that's why</i>
<i>i never liked your mother.</i>

221
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,594
Well, you cleared
it up for me.

222
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,797
<i>Well, it's far from</i>
<i>clear to me.</i>

223
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,034
<i>Okay. I think you need</i>
<i>to give it some more thought,</i>

224
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:47,804
<i>and allow the feelings</i>
<i>associated with the statue</i>

225
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,940
<i>to express themselves.</i>

226
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,742
Yeah, yeah.

227
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,410
<i>You need to.</i>

228
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,345
<i>So is that all?</i>

229
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:58,582
You still talk
like a doctor.

230
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,051
<i>I am a doctor.</i>

231
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,454
<i>Good night, Leon.</i>

232
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,690
Night, doctor.

233
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:27,371

236
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:05,675
<i>There was a time</i>
<i>when I was everything to you.</i>

237
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,911
<i>A time when</i>
<i>you loved me</i>

238
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,947
<i>as much as</i>
<i>i loved you.</i>

239
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,451
<i>A time when you sought</i>
<i>my comfort</i>

240
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:17,087
<i>whenever you were sad,</i>

241
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,656
<i>or afraid.</i>

242
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,529
<i>But you never liked</i>
<i>the game of candles.</i>

243
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,867
<i>You never could</i>
<i>forget it.</i>

244
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:37,574
<i>And a desperate thought</i>
<i>entered your head.</i>

245
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:42,579
<i>That's when you</i>
<i>started to hate me,</i>

246
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,448
<i>your own mother.</i>

247
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:49,019

<i>How can I help you</i>
<i>tonight?</i>

358
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:22,878
I just had a disturbance
a few minutes ago.

359
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,081
I think, um, someone
may have been trying

360
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,316
to break in my house.

361
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:29,485
<i>Would you like me to call</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

Yes.

394

397
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:25,868
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>

398
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,371
What is that moving?

399
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:32,174
<i>It appears to be</i>
<i>an animal.</i>

400
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,043

There's... there's
somebody in the house.

418
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:48,010
- <i>Who? Who is it?</i>
- I don't know. I just...

<i>Have you called</i>

420
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:51,113
No, no, no.
It's, um...

421
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:53,415
It's not that kind
of somebody.

439
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:29,651
<i>Feel it rising</i>
<i>in your body,</i>

440
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:32,187

- Yeah.
- ( Banging
continues )

442

01:01:44,068 --> 01:01:45,233
Yeah.

446
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,803
<i>Flowing through you,</i>
<i>calming you,</i>

447

<i>washing away</i>
<i>everything around you,</i>

448
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:53,275
<i>until the only thing</i>
<i>that is left</i>

449
01:01:53,277 --> 01:01:54,576
<i>is the calm.</i>

450
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:56,178
<i>Now open your eyes.</i>

451
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,281
( Leon breathing

Okay.

458
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,632
<i>So no more calls, okay?</i>

459
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:19,301
No.

460
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:21,369
<i>Good night, Leon.</i>

461

<i>Believe.</i>

473

No.

No.

<i>Leon?</i>
<i>What time is it?</i>

01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:34,569
I wanna sell everything.

I want it all gone.

01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:37,772
I'll send you
a full inventory

485

<i>Um... yeah.</i>
<i>Sure.</i>

487
01:09:43,046 --> 01:09:47,248
Okay? Thanks.
Sorry for waking you up.

490
01:10:51,147 --> 01:10:56,251
<i>So much</i>
<i>i need to explain.</i>

491
01:10:57,219 --> 01:11:01,322
<i>I waited so long</i>
<i>for you to come back.</i>

492
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:06,394
<i>I waited so long.</i>

493
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:13,835
<i>Until I realized</i>
<i>you never would.</i>

494
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:20,742
<i>That night, I saw</i>
<i>something through the window,</i>

495
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:24,646
<i>and I told myself</i>

496
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:27,348
<i>it was just a cat.</i>

497
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:32,186
<i>I tried to occupy myself,</i>

498
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:34,956
<i>but I was afraid.</i>

499
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:40,128
<i>I could feel it</i>
<i>watching me.</i>

500
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:44,098
<i>I wanted to talk to you</i>
<i>to tell you</i>

501
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,367
<i>that I'd made a mistake,</i>

502
01:11:46,369 --> 01:11:48,903
<i>that you were</i>
<i>more important to me</i>

503
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:52,874
<i>than anything else</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

504
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:57,312
<i>But my thoughts</i>
<i>were confused,</i>

505
01:11:57,314 --> 01:12:00,214
<i>and I kept thinking</i>

506
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:05,987
<i>it was too big</i>
<i>to be a cat.</i>

507
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:15,830
<i>That's when I realized</i>
<i>what I'd been trying to ignore</i>

508
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,966
<i>for so long.</i>

509
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:24,038
<i>That you had turned</i>
<i>your back on me.</i>

510
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:29,110
<i>That you abandoned me.</i>

511
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:33,748
<i>That you</i>
<i>no longer cared.</i>

512
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:42,890
<i>That my little angel</i>
<i>would no longer protect me.</i>

513
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,225
( Gasping )

514
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:47,762
<i>And when faith is gone...</i>

515
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:55,203
<i>Loneliness can be</i>
<i>a monster.</i>

516
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:30,037
<i>I thought you would</i>
<i>come to me then.</i>

517
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,342
<i>But you never did.</i>

518
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:48,289
<i>The funeral</i>
<i>was empty without you.</i>

519
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,532
<i>The loneliness</i>
<i>is worse now</i>
