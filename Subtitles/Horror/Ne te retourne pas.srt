1
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:09,252
DON'T LOOK BACK

2
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,200
Let's go, Jeanne.

3
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:09,872
Robert...

4
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,284
Come on, have a seat.

5
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,024
All right...

6
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,851
Why do you insist?

7
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,463
Why are you so set
on writing fiction?

8
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,092
You didn't like it?
No.

9
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,203
Forgive me but I'd rather be frank.

10
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,200
It doesn't work. Drop it.

11
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,810
I want to write this story.

12
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,074
Your thing, Jeanne,
isn't stories or novels.

13
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,714
You write remarkable biographies.

14
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,915
Intrusive historical studies.

15
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,713
Even your guides are original.

16
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,850
That's not writing,
that's journalism.

17
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,686
Really? And?

18
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,955
I'm sick of it.

19
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,656
I want to change. As a little girl...

20
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,364
That was ages ago.

21
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,130
You need a subject
you can get a hold on.

22
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,705
Why do you insist
on writing about childhood?

23
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,276
But... That's what inspires me.

24
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,380
The trouble is, it doesn't.

25
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,746
There's stuff here.

26
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,443
But only isolated images.

27
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,782
The heroine observes
but has no flesh or emotions.

28
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,284
It's too detailed for a story
that doesn't hold water.

29
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,356
All the details are important.

30
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,330
I want the descriptions
to be precise.

31
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,432
I know, Jeanne, but it's so cold.

32
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,168
You don't draw enough
on your own memories.

33
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,171
I have no memories.

34
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,542
Nothing before I turned 8.

35
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,339
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

36
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,410
Your mother never said.
You neither.

37
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,255
But...
Never mind!

38
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:01,588
We have objects, photos.
My mother told me things...

39
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,996
Memory isn't information.
It's feelings, emotions...

40
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,191
It eludes me
so it interests me.

41
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,935
I need to write this.
I need to find my childhood.

42
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,374
My life lacks something.

43
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,377
Thanks for your time.

44
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,322
Jeanne...

45
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,355
Are you ok?

46
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,068
Yes...

47
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,683
How many?

48
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,376
1.

49
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,580
3 for me.

50
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,495
Nadia, your call.

51
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:28,974
1,000--

52
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,066
I'll see you.

53
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,171
A thousand in.

54
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,180
Raise by 3.

55
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,478
Fold.

56
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,356
All right.

57
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,019
Raise you 1,000--

58
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,060
I'll stake the pot.

59
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,321
Come on, children.

60
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,898
Drawings and coats. Let's go.

61
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,028
Jeanne...

62
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,030
Nadia, play.

63
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,263
Just a second, dear!
Count me out.

64
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,373
He's not interested?

65
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,709
No.

66
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,011
Why not?

67
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,281
Too descriptive, factual, detailed...
Too cerebral.

68
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,879
Detailed?
Forget it.

69
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,325
Let me read it and see.

70
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,824
No, not yet.

71
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,986
Maybe autobiography
isn't right for you.

72
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,795
I read them "Jeanne's Stories".

73
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,195
It's 30 years old!

74
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,329
Was that your dad?
Was he your brother?

75
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,738
Were they nice?

76
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,436
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Don't worry, my kitten.

77
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,545
Nadia, are you coming?

78
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,120
Have dinner at the club.

79
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,915
I hate seeing you play.

80
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,815
I hate their mugs.
Somewhere else...

81
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,085
No, I'm tired.

82
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,122
You'd look better
without those highlights.

83
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,262
Bye, you darlings!

84
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,404
Bye, Grandma.

85
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,405
I'll call you later.

86
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,207
Just a second!

87
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,459
Robert's a jerk.
Your book's great!

88
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,732
I cancelled my dinner.
I'll stay in.

89
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,169
No, I hate that!

90
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,869
Just for us. The kids love it.

91
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,100
Go on then...

92
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,649
Come on, smile.

93
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,094
Shit!

94
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,959
One boy's scared of apples.

95
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,034
Weird!

96
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,493
Enough. Let's eat!

97
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,469
Revisiting your works?

98
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,404
No, it's nothing.

99
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,002
I had more imagination then.

100
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,609
It's old.
Use what inspires you now.

101
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,708
Mum said that too.

102
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,208
Maybe it's a bad idea then.

103
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,628
Look at me.
Talk. It's recording.

104
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,657
You'll be slaves to this thing.

105
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:42,859
He's a pain!

106
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,294
I won't stay.

107
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,997
Let go of her.
- Leave me alone!

108
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,097
Mind the table.

109
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,335
Stop, I don't like that.

110
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,078
Again? Stop it!

111
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,179
Fascinating.

112
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,353
Who does the dishes?

113
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,892
Am I tired or something?

114
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,796
It looks like the table's parallel
to the window.

115
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,266
Yes, like usual.

116
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,820
You moved it.

117
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,661
Why did you move the table?

118
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,368
It's been there since we moved in.

119
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,802
I don't mind as long
as you put things back.

120
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:00,979
Léa...

121
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,301
What is this crap?

122
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,688
What are those movements
and looks about?

123
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,689
Maybe the tape skipped.

124
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,159
You're so childish!

125
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,111
Is this for me?

126
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,539
No.

127
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,846
Was your film good?

128
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,086
Stop, I hate that.

129
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,860
I let you work. I deserve a reward.

130
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,122
I'll make hot chocolate.

131
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,396
Morning.

132
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,971
I couldn't wake you.

133
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:36,971
The table's still there?

134
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,475
What? Don't start that again.

135
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,103
I have a say
in the kitchen layout too, you know.

136
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,219
Where's the honey?

137
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,189
Just put everything back.

138
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,296
I hope you remember because I do.

139
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,024
I can't spend my time looking for stuff.

140
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,664
No one touched a thing.

141
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,733
What's up with you?

142
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,165
Want to check my cock too?

143
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,139
It was to the right before and...

144
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,469
Very funny.

145
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,611
Jeremie! Hands on the table!

146
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,523
Eat up.

147
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,219
Léa, sit down too!

148
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,475
What's on the 27th?

149
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,715
Who are you signalling to?

150
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,847
Someone opposite?

151
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,117
Are you crazy?

152
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,688
Of course. I'm crazy!

153
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,054
Move this damn table!

154
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,896
Calm down.
No!

155
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,698
That's boiling!

156
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,825
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

157
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,372
I'll do it!

158
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,607
Ok, it's no big deal.

159
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,004
I'm tired.

160
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,847
I'm just tired, ok.

161
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,908
Let's do your hair.

162
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,450
Stop it!

163
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,493
No! Leave me alone, Dad!

164
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,183
Stop it!

165
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,453
It wasn't a bad birthday party.

166
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,432
Sit still or I'll hurt you.

167
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,527
I like other people's homes.
They're weird.

168
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,871
I don't like his mum.

169
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,469
She flattens my hair
and she smells of eggs.

170
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,603
Raw eggs or cooked?

171
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,439
Ham, rather.

172
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,792
No way, but go ahead.

173
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,761
Misconduct.

174
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,897
I'll invent something.

175
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,205
Totally fake, I don't care!

176
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,232
Enough to fire him.

177
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,480
I'm losing time, customers,
my sanity...

178
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,520
He's not just plain incompetent,

179
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,987
he's after us. And he'll find us!

180
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,653
What's wrong?

181
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,988
Nothing.

182
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,029
Off you go.

183
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,236
See you.

184
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:12,387
The trainee's pissing me off.
I'll end up punching him.

185
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,387
Do... do you want a drink?

186
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,270
Little bird...

187
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,601
Come to my hand...

188
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,279
Léa?

189
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,639
You scared my bird away!

190
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,689
Get your pyjamas on.
Grandma won't be long.

191
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,324
Which poster is best
for our Woody Allen day?

192
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,832
I prefer that one.

193
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,496
What's all this?

194
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,800
You've gone off the apartment?

195
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,643
No, they're just doodles.

196
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,538
You're obsessed with that table.

197
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,684
Any idea where my Bulgarian necklace is?

198
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,886
Jeanne, answer me.

199
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:22,482
I see changes everywhere.
The table and all the rest.

200
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,758
Even your faces, your eyes.

201
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,621
What do you mean?

202
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,598
This apartment is totally unfamiliar.

203
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,730
I recognize things, the furniture...

204
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,297
But it's not us.

205
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,741
And in the photos and videos,

206
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,407
I don't recognize anyone at all.

207
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,211
It's another family.

208
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,786
Outside, I'm ok.

209
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,650
But here...

210
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,495
You can't be serious?

211
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,418
Not recognizing things is bad.

212
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,581
It's a brain problem.

213
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,751
A lesion, maybe a tumour.

214
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,188
A tumour?

215
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,388
You're freaking me out!

216
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,825
I recognize you.

217
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,491
You said you didn't.

218
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,267
I do, I recognize lots of things.

219
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,702
I don't have a tumour!

220
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,278
Maybe it's your eyes.

221
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,416
See the optometrist.
Call Feldmann.

222
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,282
I'm scared...

223
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,961
Maybe it's nothing.

224
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,297
But you need to check.

225
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,625
Everything's ok.

226
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,299
We'll relax tonight.

227
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,469
No talking about books.

228
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,377
Good evening.
Hello, Teo.

229
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,785
Are you well?
Very. The kids have eaten.

230
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,858
Jeanne's in our room.
I'll go in.

231
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,292
A drink?

232
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,657
You don't return my calls?

233
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,322
I haven't had time.

234
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,225
It stresses me when you worry.

235
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,863
Thank you.

236
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,498
No...

237
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,713
I won't insist.
I don't understand but...

238
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,473
Never mind.

239
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,818
There's food in the fridge.
Thanks for the shawl.

240
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,356
Basically, a woman witnesses a crime.

241
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,465
She hears a shot go off near her.

242
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:20,466
Everyone around her
tries to play down the trauma.

243
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,567
But, soon after, she goes deaf.

244
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,767
I'm lost.

245
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,945
That's not what happens.
Shut up!

246
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,804
She links it to the detonation.

247
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,916
But her husband doesn't remember,
even though he was there.

248
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,351
It's like he's erased it.

249
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,221
So she starts suspecting him,

250
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,527
suspecting the people around her

251
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,721
because they act weird with her.

252
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,465
And...

253
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,995
She spies on others, searches...

254
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,899
You're scared she could get killed.

255
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,405
But she realizes she already
got killed at the start.

256
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,945
It sounds great.

257
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,213
That's bullshit!

258
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,308
Have you forgotten your Italian?

259
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,809
I remember it perfectly.

260
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,716
Ok, ok...

261
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,416
Is that enough or shall I go on?

262
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,917
Anyway, that's not the story.

263
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,563
A woman sees an accident
and realizes it's a crime.

264
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,671
The police won't listen
and you realize it's a conspiracy.

265
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,229
It doesn't make much sense.

266
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,387
We'll see and decide.

267
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,387
What are you doing?

268
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,792
Nothing. I don't know...

269
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,565
Why are you crying?

270
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,367
What?

271
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,411
I'm not crying.

272
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,982
I don't understand.

273
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,787
I'm not sad.

274
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,183
I didn't even realize.

275
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,256
Are you hiding something?

276
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,995
The novel, your eyes...

277
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,632
You're miles away.
You're never with us.

278
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,868
Even the kids have noticed.

279
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:57,639
They said so?

280
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:15,421
Has the book put you in this state
or is it something else?

281
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,730
I don't know...

282
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,769
I don't know.

283
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,506
I don't understand.

284
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,216
I'll make an effort.

285
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,287
Right...

286
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,487
Come to bed, it's 3 a.m.

287
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,297
Are you crazy?

288
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,231
Watch where you're going!

289
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,231
This can't be real...

290
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,284
Here you go.

291
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:58,995
Thank you.

292
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,598
Forgetting is normal.
You never call your own number.

293
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,740
What happened?

294
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:14,903
She's all on edge.

295
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,705
I had a memory lapse but I'm ok now.

296
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,350
Come on, the kids are alone.

297
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,988
See you tomorrow.

298
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,949
What's happening tomorrow?
The same as usual.

299
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,417
Want to turn vegetarian?

300
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,372
Hurry up!

301
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,682
Come on in.

302
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,454
Jeremie! Léa!

303
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,888
Children!
We're in our room!

304
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,626
Jeremie!

305
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,847
Mum!

306
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,557
I'm hot, I'm sweating.
I'll go and change.

307
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,571
Let's choose cartoons.
Yeah!

308
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,451
Jeanne?

309
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,260
What's wrong?

310
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,761
What's wrong?

311
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,232
You see?

312
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,369
Yes, your face is really red.

313
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:05,933
Is that all?

314
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:08,942
What do you mean?

315
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,944
I don't get it.

316
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,883
What's going on?

317
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,582
What's wrong?
Sit down.

318
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,887
I'm burning up...

319
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,429
What did Feldmann find?

320
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,737
Nothing.

321
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,301
Well, he did...

322
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:40,709
Some ocular pressure.
It could be that.

323
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,473
What else could it be?

324
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,209
Nothing. I don't know...

325
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,784
You got a prescription?

326
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,944
Yes.

327
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,280
You don't seem sure.

328
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,783
Let's call him and ask.

329
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,587
No, not now, please.

330
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,326
Tomorrow, ok?

331
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,535
You feel hot?
Yes.

332
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,610
Hot how?
Stop, your hands are cold!

333
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,546
They'll cool you.
Stop it!

334
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:22,777
Stop!

335
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,424
Let's go away
after the Woody Allen day.

336
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,689
It'll do us good.

337
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,629
Why not the Hotel Borgne?
You liked it.

338
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,030
Borgne?
Yes.

339
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,733
Never been there.

340
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,701
It wasn't me.

341
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,606
You sang "I Was a Fireman"
in the harbour karaoke bar.

342
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,210
That was definitely you.

343
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,942
That was there?

344
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,650
How do you know?

345
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,484
I mean, you remember?

346
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,791
Teo...

347
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:14,998
I miss you.

348
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,537
I can't help this.

349
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,542
It'll get better soon.

350
00:41:58,382 --> 00:41:59,644
Relax.

351
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,284
Relax...

352
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:14,724
Teo?

353
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:16,817
Teo?

354
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,589
No!

355
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,432
Get off me, you bastard!
Get off me!

356
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,445
I'm sorry.

357
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,881
No, it was good.

358
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,222
The look of disgust,
"Get off me, you bastard"...

359
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,451
I love it.

360
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:52,923
I didn't dare ask

361
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,991
but calling me "piece of shit"
would be even better!

362
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,282
Dad, the movie's over

363
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,755
Mum will wash you.

364
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,559
I'm going out for some air.

365
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:31,634
No...

366
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,667
Get me to hospital.

367
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,404
Jeanne has always been fragile.

368
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,879
She had an accident at the age of 8

369
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,985
that left her with amnesia.
Maybe it's important.

370
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,717
These changes you see...
What has changed exactly?

371
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,322
Everything.

372
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,632
Colours, objects,

373
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,428
other people...

374
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:07,729
Me...

375
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,504
You? What are you like?

376
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:12,939
I'm...

377
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:18,942
I've always had brown hair
and pale green eyes.

378
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,582
And how do you see your husband?

379
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,689
Fine. Fine...

380
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,521
Handsome.

381
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,531
Well, fairly handsome.

382
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:41,497
I see him with short, brown hair,
fairly dishevelled,

383
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,668
dark blue eyes,

384
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,741
a small scar on his forehead,

385
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,836
broad shoulders,

386
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,979
a slight stoop,

387
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,648
fairly tall, a dark complexion...

388
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,679
But you don't have to agree.

389
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,659
No, I see him the way you do.
But, before...

390
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,360
He had brown eyes...

391
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:10,261
a light complexion,
very dark, wavy hair...

392
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,868
He was bigger, heavier...

393
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,198
He was the man I'd always lived with.

394
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,972
Sorry, but he's not the same man.

395
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,735
This is incredible!

396
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,605
Mr. Garsch,
let's try to understand this.

397
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,809
Could you leave us together?

398
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:30,419
Yes.

399
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:31,985
Thank you.

400
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,239
Yes? I'm listening.

401
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:53,906
Nothing, that's all.

402
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,571
There were those changes,
those signs...

403
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,173
They were like...

404
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,578
signs addressed to someone,

405
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,618
sly expressions.
But they've vanished.

406
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,519
It was like a secret between them,

407
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,422
unrelated moments...

408
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,354
A dream?

409
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,726
No, not at all.

410
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,567
Does the idea of change alarm you?

411
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,732
Not to this extent.

412
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,368
This seems staged.

413
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,306
My husband and children
seem to be manipulating me.

414
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,572
You said you'd changed too.

415
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:34,709
So, you think the problem lies with you.

416
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,382
There's something else.

417
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:40,787
It can't be me alone.

418
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,621
It's all so otherwise.

419
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,696
When you say "otherwise".

420
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,922
You could be saying, "the other lies".

421
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:51,863
You think I'm lying?

422
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:53,760
I said "the other".

423
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,302
What other?

424
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,332
Just an idea...

425
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:01,001
This concern about manipulation,
hidden reality...

426
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,708
It's just what I hear.

427
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,979
Perception is shaped
by what we believe or know.

428
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:13,450
It's like a drawing that has
a second one hidden within it.

429
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,791
I just drew
plans of my apartment to...

430
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,728
That's not what I meant.

431
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,330
It was a metaphor.

432
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:27,727
I don't know.

433
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,469
Lies...

434
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,837
I don't know...

435
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,243
I think she needs therapy
but it's her decision.

436
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:48,322
Putting her under observation
could complicate things.

437
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:52,553
There's no neurological trouble,
so see how it develops.

438
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:53,821
Thank you.
Goodbye.

439
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,329
Thank you.

440
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,334
I want to go to my mother's
to take a break.

441
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,334
You used to need me, not your mother.

442
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:05,939
Will you drop me off?

443
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,622
Careful, you're driving too fast.

444
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,692
Please don't be angry with me.

445
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,661
Call me tomorrow?

446
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:02,656
Yes.

447
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,777
Mum?

448
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,579
Mum?

449
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:20,509
Mum?

450
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:21,901
Sweetheart?

451
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:23,704
Just a second.

452
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:25,774
Mum...

453
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,509
I feel so weird.

454
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,284
Take me home with you.

455
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,922
Give me 10 minutes, ok?

456
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,556
Why not now?
How long have you been here?

457
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,593
I can't right now!

458
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,261
In 10 minutes.

459
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,856
10 or 15, I don't know.

460
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,596
Have a drink.

461
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,383
Madam?

462
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,577
Something to drink?

463
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,845
Nothing. Thank you.

464
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,190
Ace.

465
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,588
1,000--

466
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,760
Your call, sir.

467
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,544
3 queens win.
