00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:46,277
<i>Here's a bulletin from Washington.</i>

3
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,969
<i>I just feel as if everything</i>

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,018
<i>I've got an animal head right there.</i>

5
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:56,745
<i>Do you know what did it?</i>

6
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,721
<i>We say it's the only way to look terrific.</i>

7
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,907
<i>- He understands all about the gifts.</i>
<i>...recent string of fatal attacks.</i>

00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:09,357
<i>This next one coming up is in the park.</i>

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,880
<i>It's the second victim.</i>

10
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:20,585
<i>She's ours.</i>

11
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:26,438
<i>Now with this film out,</i>
<i>the public is dying to see her.</i>

12
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,668
<i>It's for real.</i>

13
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,500
<i>... Dr. George Waggner explains</i>

<i>You can take it out.</i>

15
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,273
<i>We saw pictures</i>
<i>just like we saw in his room.</i>

16
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:53,801
<i>It is, after all, what we are.</i>

<i>... TV, Channel 6, Los Angeles.</i>

18
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:56,999
<i>Repression.</i>

19
00:01:57,616 --> 00:02:00,812
<i>Repression is the father of neurosis...</i>

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,604
<i>of self-hatred.</i>

21
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:07,467
<i>Stress results</i>
<i>when we fight against our impulses.</i>

22
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:12,424
<i>We've all heard people talk about</i>
<i>animal magnetism...</i>

23
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,344
<i>the natural man...</i>

24
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,094
the noble savage...

25
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:19,883
as if we'd lost something valuable...

26
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,760
in our long evolution
into civilized human beings.

27
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:24,741
There's a good reason for this.

28
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:26,952
Man is a combination...

29
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:31,751
of the learned and the instinctual,
of the sophisticated and the primitive.

30
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:35,788
<i>We should never try to deny the beast...</i>

31
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:37,605
<i>the animal within us.</i>

32
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:41,576
- The minute anything breaks, cut to Chris.
- Before Doc pitches his book?

33
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:45,509
Hell, he's been coaching Karen on
how to talk to this psycho. He won't mind.

34
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:53,444
How much?

35
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:59,118
How much for a half and half?

36
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:01,033
Sorry, but excuse me.

37
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:03,562
Excuse me.

38
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:08,107
- You're that TV lady, ain't you?
- Yeah, buzz off.

39
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:10,886
Jesus.

40
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:13,769
- Did Karen see this?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,049
Oh, shit.

42
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,660
She never even mentioned
seeing the victims.

43
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:20,557
She didn't want you to worry.

44
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:25,160
I'm worried.

45
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,931
Okay, guys, this is the jackpot.

46
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:41,676
I'm on Western between<i>...</i>

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,258
<i>I'll transmit as soon as Eddie calls.</i>

48
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:48,426
- I don't like the interference.
- It's the best rig we got.

49
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:52,045
No, it's all that neon out there.
It messes up the signal.

50
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,469
I'll get our people to cruise Western.

51
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,185
Boy, there's a lot of
flotsam and jetsam out tonight, ain't there?

52
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,197
Seems like there's more of them
every time I get out here.

53
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,766
I wonder where they come from,
where they're going to.

54
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:09,476
I don't know where they're from,
but they got to where they're going.

55
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,461
<i>... six, David Jail, 1455.</i>

<i>Repeat, report any sighting.</i>

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,691
She's wearing a purple and lavender outfit.
We'll be able to spot her pretty easy.

59
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,861
Yeah, I've seen her on the news.

60

Good evening.

00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:19,012
- Terry, how are you?
- Good. How's it going?

72
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,288
I'll need a few more minutes.

73
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:29,197
Jesus, there's a guy standing
right outside the booth now.

74
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:30,605
I don't know if it's him or not.

75
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:33,159
Lieutenant Shantz, Detective Kline...

76
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,400
this is Karen's husband.

77
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:38,089
You've got quite a brave young lady there,
Mr. White.

78
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,193
Neill, Bill Neill.
My wife uses her maiden name.

79
00:05:41,263 --> 00:05:43,019
Bill Neill. Stanford, right?

80
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,341
So how is it going?

81
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,611
I have not got a clean word from Karen
in the last 15 minutes.

82
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:50,759
15 minutes?

83
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,540
<i>Hello.</i>

84
00:05:57,647 --> 00:05:59,403
Hold it. She's transmitting.

85
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:03,084
<i>Come on, Eddie. I know that it's you.</i>

86
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:06,989
Yeah, I'm alone.

87
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,024
Are you wearing what I asked you to?

88
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:13,860
Good.

89
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,813
Where's the sound?

90
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:24,364
- That's it.
- What?

91
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:26,373
I'm afraid we might've lost her.

92
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,603
Lost her?

93
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:32,557
What the hell kind of
half-assed operation is this?

94
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:36,972
Okay, Eddie, I'll be there
in just a little while.

95
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:44,493
Okay, mister, it's all yours.

96
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,978
You said you'd never be out of contact.
What kind of operation are you running?

97
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:59,363
- They have people in the area...
- What does that mean, <i>"</i>in the area<i>"</i>?

98
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,813
They will find her!

99
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:26,284
Okay, guys, this is it.
I'll keep the transmitter open.

100
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:50,599
- Hello, Eddie.
- I knew you'd come, Karen.

101
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,180
We have a lot to talk about, you and me.

102
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:04,296
- Can I turn around and see you?
- Not yet, Karen.

103
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:07,079
Just watch.

104
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:12,454
- Yeah, she asked me directions to it.
- How long ago?

105
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:13,956
A couple of minutes.

106
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,094
<i>The struggle between mind and body...</i>

107
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,723

<i>It produces anger, frustration,</i>
<i>the strain of modern-day living...</i>

109

<i>in a world that is moving too quickly.</i>

110
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:29,258
Three minutes to commercial.

111
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:31,335
Two, push in to a single on the doctor.

<i>All of us have a great</i>
<i>untapped potential for living.</i>

<i>The gift of life.</i>

00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:57,549
Camera 2, give me a two-shot.

120
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,741
She didn't feel a thing, Karen.
None of them do.

121
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:05,038
They're not real, the people here.
They're dead.

122
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,859
They could never be like me.

123
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:10,382
But you're different, Karen.

124
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,948
I watch you on TV.

125
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,785
And I know how good I can make you feel.

126
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,690
I'm going to light up your whole body.

127
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,680
Turn around now, Karen.

128
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:37,133
I want to give you something.

129
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:51,207
There's a broad that came in here.
She emptied the place out.

130
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,902
She's watching movies.

131
00:10:58,543 --> 00:10:59,491
Please!

132
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:11,310
My God, Jesus Christ!

133
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:15,078
Put your piece away!

134
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:21,130
I knew I shouldn't have let
that broad back here.

135
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,143
Go to remote. Take it.

00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,503
What happened back there?

140
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,995
Don't ask me, Lieutenant.

Nothing newsy.

I don't know what happened in there.

152
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,895
I don't remember.

Please, don't do it!

I turned around, but I didn't see him.

00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:00,551
- It's Number 27, down the hall.
- Thank you.

158
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:03,628
Did the guy say anything else?

159
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:08,140
He just said he worked with a kid
named Eddie, that he thought lived here.

160
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:11,368
- He did say the kid hated washing dishes.
- Who doesn't?

161
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:13,605
Here we go.

162
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,443
Charming.

163
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,081
Oh, God.

164
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,508
It's just your average, red-blooded,
all-American boy.

165
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:53,130
Get out of here!

166
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,197
Boy, Doc's gonna have a field day
with these.

167
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,270
Karen.

168
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:05,159
Look at this.

169
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:09,416
Not bad. The kid had talent.

170
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:14,692
He could've designed
the Marquis de Sade coloring book.

171
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,251
I think we better call the cops.

172
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:38,789
Eventually.

173
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:40,711
Look at this.

174
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,525
I wonder if this is a real place.

175
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,498
So what's the story
on our next Norman Rockwell?

176
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:55,682
This sort of person is controlled
by the right hemisphere of the brain.

177
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,010
That dominates the non-rational...

178
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,438
the artistic, the creative impulses.

179
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:07,403
It's not unusual
for a killer to draw as well as that.

180
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:11,047
It's not a bad angle, Doc.
Do you mind putting that on tape for us?

181
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,164
Not at all.

182
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,197
We're pushing Fred for a half-hour special
called <i>The Mind of Eddie Quist...</i>

183
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,019
although we're focusing, really,
on the beast in all of us.

184
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:20,165
Good idea.

185
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,953
- So you found the last name?
- He signed his work.

186
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:28,516
So he did.

187
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,898
I'm sorry.

188
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:38,565
I guess I'm just not quite ready yet, okay?

189
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:40,841
You'll be okay.

190
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,822
Don't worry.

191
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,550
<i>Stand by, Cameras 1 and 2.</i>

192
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:59,523
<i>- Then I'm on the air.</i>
- 2, push on in.

193
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:02,278
Are you sure you're up to this?

194
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:05,797
- Nothing like diving in head first.
- That's what the old man says.

195
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:07,306
Here's our girl.

196
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:13,383
We're gonna make ratings history tonight.
You'll be the cynosure of all eyes.

197
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:15,874
That means everybody
is going to be watching you.

198
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,113
Everybody wants to see
the lady who caught Eddie the Mangler.

199
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:21,188
Terrific. You have my copy?

200
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:22,980
Good luck.

201
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:26,018
- Boy, she seems shaky.
- Looks fine to me.

202
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:29,700
- We go in 10 seconds.
<i>- Don't let this be the last stop for your car.</i>

203
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:34,347
<i>- Keep your runabout running right...</i>
- Five, four, three<i>...</i>

204
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:37,547
<i>This is KDHB TV, Channel 6, Los Angeles.</i>

205
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:38,658
Up on 2.

206
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:43,523
<i>It's the 5:00 edition</i>

00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:56,330
Are the tapes on that train wreck ready?

212
00:17:57,803 --> 00:18:01,480
<i>... 14 injured in train derailment.</i>
<i>More on the Mideast earthquake.</i>

<i>Now, here's Karen White.</i>

216
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:16,964
Good evening.

217
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:39,457
Get her out of there.

218
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:42,857
- Roll 7.
- Cue the editorial.

219
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:47,875
<i>... proclaimed no immediate danger</i>
<i>to nearby residential areas.</i>

220
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:54,122
Let's pause now for an editorial
from our General Manager, Fred W. Francis.

221
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,779
Here's Fred.

222
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,938
<i>In keeping with this station's pledge</i>
<i>of community involvement...</i>

223
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:03,524
<i>we present an editorial</i>
<i>from KDHB station manager, Fred Francis.</i>

224
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,801
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. You need a little more time.

225
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:13,857
<i>There's been a lot of talk in the past month</i>
<i>about our culture of violence.</i>

226
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,657
Who knows? Maybe she's pregnant.

227
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:19,203
Get in touch with Fujiama, Fujimoto,
or whatever the hell her name is...

228
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:21,544
and get her ready for the 11:00 report.

229
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:24,133
Now there is a pro.

230
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:29,834
You can't be afraid of dreams.

231
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,574
I can't help it. All I remember...

232
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,197
is pushing open the door...

233
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:40,105
and then I'm outside...

234
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:44,713
and the police are there, Bill's there,
and the remote crew, and it's over.

235
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:52,391
There's blood on me, and I can't imagine
who it might have came from.

236
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,976
You can't remember
anything that happened inside the booth?

237
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,328
No, not really.

238
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,311
Just weird little pieces in my dreams.

239
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:06,751
How're you and Bill?

240
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:09,088
Trying to communicate.

241
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:15,622
- Tell me, Doctor, how crazy am I?
- Completely bananas.

242
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:17,569
I think so.

243
00:20:17,643 --> 00:20:20,992
I recommend that you go out to the Colony
for a week or two.

244
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:24,224
- Your place up north there?
- That's right.

245
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,982
I only recommend it
to very special patients...

246
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,505
ones who I think will benefit
from its environment.

247
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:32,000
It's a place where you can
recharge your batteries.

248
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:35,304
<i>It'll enable you to try and get back</i>
<i>to what you really are.</i>

249
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:37,513
<i>What goes on up there?</i>

250
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:41,321
<i>Seminars, group therapy. It's very low-key.</i>

251
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:44,706
<i>It'll be a good place</i>
<i>to try and tackle this amnesia thing.</i>

252
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:48,516
I don't know if I want to remember.

253
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:50,303
What?

254
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:55,240
Doc said, once I remembered what
happened, it wouldn't scare me anymore.

255
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:56,616
I'm not so sure.

256
00:20:57,483 --> 00:20:59,686
Honey, give this place a chance, okay?

257
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,987
We've got to do something.

258
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:05,446
I hope these people aren't too weird.

259
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:22,532
Jerry Warren, softwares.

260
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:24,997
Bill Neill, hardware.

261
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:26,175
Hardware?

262
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:27,689
He doesn't get it, Bill.

263
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:31,104
I own a couple of health clubs, barbells,
hardware. This is my wife Karen.

264
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:32,967
Hi, nice to meet you.

265
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:35,555
- Prime rib?
- No, I try to stay away from meat.

266
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,765
- Maybe later. Thank you.
- Thank you.

267
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:40,224
Did you see that meat?

268
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:44,969
Oh, my God!
We watch you on the news all the time.

269
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:47,235
You're our second favorite...

270
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:50,602
right behind<i>...</i>
What's the name of that Oriental girl, Jerry?

271
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,423
This is my wife, Donna.

272
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:57,375
- Get me out of here, Bill.
- Looky here!

273
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,109
Welcome to the Colony!

274
00:21:59,499 --> 00:22:02,728
Charlie Barton, Bill and Karen<i>...</i>

275
00:22:02,794 --> 00:22:04,682
- White.
- Neill.

276
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:08,522
Charlie's on our board. He put up
all the cattle for tonight's barbecue.

277
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:10,982
I seen you on television!

278
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,546
Thank you.

279
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:16,772
If you fellows don't mind,
I'm going to borrow Karen...

280
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:19,046
and give her the run-down on the Colony.

281
00:22:19,114 --> 00:22:21,219
- Don't leave out the juicy stuff.
- I won't.

282
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,468
Come on.

283
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,018
- Let's get this boy some bacon.
- You say when now, Bill.

284
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:50,209
Can't go on like this.

285
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:52,991
Damn teeth are shot.

286
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,663
Hell of a note.

287
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:05,957
You want some?

288
00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:08,032
Sure, why not?

289
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,468
What's in it?

290
00:23:14,283 --> 00:23:15,330
It's good.

291
00:23:16,874 --> 00:23:17,823
I'm Bill.

292
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:19,489
I know.

293
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,776
I'm looking for my wife.

294
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:28,609
Why?

295
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:35,170
Excuse me.

296
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:45,189
...opening up and letting it all come out.

297
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,877
I've found parts of me
I didn't even know existed.

298
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:51,329
Now you can see why I brought you here.
You won't be cold here.

299
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:55,777
- Speaking of cold, how is your bungalow?
- It's quite nice, thanks.

300
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,989
- We're neighbors.
- You are?

301
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:02,787
Tell me something else.
Do you miss the television?

302
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:05,704
Are you kidding?
I don't have to pin my hair up.

303
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:06,053
Are you kidding?
I don't have to pin my hair up.

304
00:24:14,023 --> 00:24:16,129
Hello, Marsha. How are you?

305
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:19,651
Take this book back.
I don't want my brother reading it.

306
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,374
I think he said he'd like to.

307
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,959
You've done enough damage already.

308
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,038
- Bitch.
- No.

309
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:39,005
We can all learn a great deal from Marsha.

310
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:41,382
She's a very elemental person.

311
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:43,750
It's all that natural energy.

312
00:24:44,423 --> 00:24:45,885
She's a nymphomaniac.

313
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,908
It's just that it's so unchanneled.

314
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:54,913
She has a long way to go.

315
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:54,565
Let me go! I want to end it!

316
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:56,192
Easy, buddy, just calm down.

317
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,914
This is the only way.
I got to end it, I got to burn!

318
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:01,253
Calm down. Think a minute.

319
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,967
You got to let me do it, Doc.

320
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:06,820
- Jesus.
- Don't worry.

321
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:11,654
That's one of Erle's favorite tricks.
He's just trying to get attention.

322
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:14,947
I want to end it. It just goes on and on.

323
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:16,738
You know better than that.

324
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:19,775
The old man shouldn't drink.
It really gets him loose.

325
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:23,267
Believe me, come tomorrow...

326
00:26:23,463 --> 00:26:26,562
people will be so pleased
to see that you're safe and sound...

327
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:28,573
they won't think anything more of it.

328
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:30,435
You get a good night's sleep.

329
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,249
Everything will seem better
in the light of day.

330
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:35,584
There, now.

331
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,490
Bill, wake up, there's something out there!

332
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,469
Outside. Something was howling.

333
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:55,231
- Listen.
- The wind.

334
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:59,360
There was something howling before.

335
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,570
Okay, sure. Somebody's dog.

336
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,317
Not like any dog I ever heard.

337
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:06,332
Honey, you were raised in L.A.

338
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:08,644
The wildest thing you ever heard
was Wolfman Jack.

339
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:10,140
This is the country.

340
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:12,735
Come on, let's try to get some sleep, okay?

341
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:15,867
Good.

342
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:53,829
You heard something outside.
Why shouldn't you call the police?

343
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:58,082
I'm embarrassed.
I wish we hadn't even called them.

344
00:29:58,148 --> 00:30:01,345
Look at this!
All the balls on my side of the court again.

345
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:04,413
What you ladies need is a good retriever.

346
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:11,298
Doc said on the phone that you folks
had a coyote problem out here.

347
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:14,203
- You're famous, ain't you?
- Sort of.

348
00:30:14,308 --> 00:30:17,243
Sam, this is Karen White.
Karen, Sam Newfield.

349
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,546
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- I used to watch you all the time.

350
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,387
You're prettier than Walter Cronkite.

351
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,137
Karen thought she saw something moving
in the bushes last night.

352
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:31,939
Coyotes is liable to come into a setup
like this to look for garbage.

353
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:34,208
- Did you hear anything?
- Me?

354
00:30:35,076 --> 00:30:36,636
I sleep like the dead.

355
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:40,676
Tattoo? I don't remember one on him
when he came in.

356
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:42,272
The coroner<i>...</i>

357
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:44,954
The coroner said
that he had one on his shoulder.

358
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:47,483
Some kind of animal head, right there.

359
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,162
I don't get many of you TV people in here.

360
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:54,848
Mostly it's the newspaper guys
who like to come in, look at the meat.

361
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:57,084
I don't know how you can stand it.

362
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,835
Doesn't bother me.
Want to unwrap him, Ross?

363
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:04,545
Let's see, Quist is still with the John Does.
We haven't had time to re-file him.

364
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:07,452
Only thing that freaked me out
since working here...

365
00:31:07,524 --> 00:31:09,248
is the night old Stu Walker came in.

366
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:13,025
The guy who worked here.
I say goodnight to him at the shift change...

367
00:31:13,092 --> 00:31:16,704
a couple hours go by, then we get a delivery
from the Oceanside unit.

368
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:18,178
I unzip the bag.

369
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,137
There's old Stu, smiling up at me,
leaking sea water out his ears.

370
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:24,545
Visitors, Eddie!

371
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:27,676
Where is he?

372
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:30,142
He was here this morning.

373
00:31:30,884 --> 00:31:32,411
God! Look at the door.

374
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,155
You don't suppose somebody
could have stolen him, do you?

375
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,595
He didn't get up and walk out on his own.

376
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:47,774
There're cows around here?

377
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:51,904
Charlie Barton's got a couple of acres
of pasture just down the hill.

378
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:56,124
They don't sound right.

379
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,162
I'm not really sure
how cows are supposed to sound.

380
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:03,742
Not like that.

381
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,786
Jerry's got a rifle, doesn't he?

382
00:32:11,332 --> 00:32:13,983
Haven't you done assertiveness training?

383
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:18,203
Before I hooked into Doc, I did it all.

384
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:22,113
I did EST, TM, Scientology...

385
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,449
iridology, primal screamers.

386
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:28,514
I don't know. I figure
another five years of real hard work...

387
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,522
and maybe I'll be a human being.

388
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:34,105
I don't see nothing.

389
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:37,697
I didn't hear anything so funny anyway.

390
00:32:39,716 --> 00:32:41,756
- Oh, Jesus!
- Christ!

391
00:32:45,412 --> 00:32:47,038
- Now what?
- What's wrong?

392
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,507
- Great!
- What's wrong?

393
00:32:49,892 --> 00:32:52,761
- What's wrong?
- Let me look at it. Let me see.

394
00:32:54,468 --> 00:32:56,737
Here. I can tell about batteries.

395
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:03,196
God, Donna. Now we're stuck out here
in the middle of Timbuktu someplace!

396
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,718
- Watch that gun.
- God!

397
00:33:06,788 --> 00:33:09,505
Sorry to scare you, ma'am.
I thought you was a cowjacker.

398
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,321
There's another one back up yonder,
tore up the same way.

399
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:15,771
- You know what did it?
- It ain't a coyote, that's a cinch.

400
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:17,280
You girls all right?

401
00:33:18,404 --> 00:33:20,771
Nothing like a quiet week in the country.

402
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:25,177
A little straighter.

403
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,830
All right, now the quick shot again.
Think fast.

404
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,318
You have potential, Bill.

405
00:33:33,156 --> 00:33:35,425
I think you're ready for your bullets.

406
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:38,717
Don't you guys usually use a dog
in this kind of hunt?

407
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:41,537
Usually. But these clowns
would shoot all of them.

408
00:33:42,244 --> 00:33:44,317
Besides, who needs dogs? We got T.C.

409
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,647
That boy's part bloodhound.

410
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:51,899
I still think it was UFOs,
them cattle mutilations.

411
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:55,932
Good, Erle. You watch the skies for us now.
That'll be your job.

412
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:59,003
- I want to talk to you.
- I thought you had a session.

413
00:33:59,076 --> 00:34:02,459
I do. But I don't want you to go do this,
not just for my sake.

414
00:34:02,532 --> 00:34:03,841
Are you kidding?

415
00:34:05,764 --> 00:34:09,790
- I've never been on a wolf hunt before.
- This is a wolf hunt, not a coot show.

416
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,416
The boys are calling me.
Do you see the boys?

417
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,518
<i>What happened then, Karen?</i>

418
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:49,691
I hear something else.

419
00:34:50,115 --> 00:34:52,832
Somebody else is breathing,
he's in there with me.

420
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:56,483
It's Eddie, and he closes the door.

421
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:59,036
And he puts a quarter into the slot.

422
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,411
And the movie starts.

423
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:05,724
And then he whispers something to me.

424
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,810
He whispers something to me,
and then he tells me...

425
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,681
I can finally turn around and look at him.

426
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,259
Turn around, Karen.

427
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,049
What do you see?

428
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:20,856
What's there, Karen?

429
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:23,996
- What do you see?
- What's there?

430
00:35:24,484 --> 00:35:27,233
- I can't see him.
- Just try. He's right there.

431
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,308
- What do you see?
- What's there?

432
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:35,265
I can't see him! I can't.

433
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:38,397
Okay. That's far enough for now.

434
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:42,075
I'm sorry.

435
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:54,074
I got him. First shot.

436
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:57,976
And he said he wasn't no hunter.

437
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,415
We get 'em all:

438
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:24,120
sun worshippers,
moon worshippers, Satanists.

439
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:27,070
The Manson people
used to hang around here and shoplift.

440
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:28,284
Bunch of deadbeats.

441
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:31,388
Do you know of any groups
that are into stealing corpses?

442
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,702
Body snatching?

443
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:36,447
If you want to read about it, I've got a book.
Slide me down.

444
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:39,895
Hold it.

445
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,322
You name it, I've got the book.

446
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:46,722
<i>"</i>A number of young women
were killed in the next month...

447
00:36:46,786 --> 00:36:49,688
<i>"</i>their bodies exhibiting signs
of animal attack<i>."</i>

448
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:51,291
What's that?

449
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:54,329
<i>Warlocks, Werewolves and Demons.</i>

450
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:05,376
If you're going to purchase, purchase.
If not, leave them. You'll get them greasy.

451
00:37:05,634 --> 00:37:08,384
We'll find out if any of Eddie's killings
were on a full moon.

452
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,305
That's a lot of Hollywood baloney.

453
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,687
Your classic werewolf can change shape
any time it wants, day or night.

454
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:17,024
That's why they're called shape-shifters.
I've got a dozen books on it.

455
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,505
- What about killing it with silver bullets?
- Sure, silver bullets or fire.

456
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:23,927
It's the only way to get rid of them.
They're worse than cockroaches.

457
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:26,555
They come back from the dead
if you don't kill them right.

458
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:27,903
Plus, they regenerate.

459
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,556
Cut off an arm or leg,
stick a knife in the heart. Nothing.

460
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:33,343
They look dead,
but three days later, they're as good as new.

461
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,061
- Do you believe in this?
- What am I, an idiot?

462
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,366
I'm making a buck here.
You want books, I got books.

463
00:37:38,435 --> 00:37:41,402
I got chicken blood, I got dog embryos,
black candles, wolfsbane.

464
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:43,580
Look at this, silver bullets.

465
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:46,496
Some joker ordered them.
.30-06. Never picked them up.

466
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:49,727
I take BankAmericard,
American Express, Visa.

467
00:37:49,794 --> 00:37:52,315
- You gonna buy that or what?
- Yeah, these two.

468
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:56,798
- There's some incredible old pictures here.
- That's a good book.

469
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:02,394
Did you see any wolves?

470
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:04,545
Nope. Just lots of rabbits.

471
00:38:05,186 --> 00:38:07,674
- What do you do with these things?
- Eat 'em.

472
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:11,740
My sister will cook it up for you, if you want.

473
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:14,042
No, I try to stay away from meat.

474
00:38:14,402 --> 00:38:15,864
Your wife might like it.

475
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:18,721
You kill something you don't eat.
Now, that's a sin.

476
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:21,816
I never thought of it like that.

477
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:23,800
Our place is just over there.

478
00:38:23,874 --> 00:38:26,394
My sister would be glad
to cook it up for you.

479
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:29,436
Are you sure?

480
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,357
Marsha just loves to cook.

481
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:42,204
Are you sure?

482
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,914
How long will it take?

483
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,745
I'll cook it later.

484
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:01,881
It happened so fast
that I didn't even see what it was.

485
00:41:01,954 --> 00:41:05,370
- Jesus, Doc, is that necessary?
- Can't take any chances.

486
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:07,863
God!

487
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,976
I want to go home.

488
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,199
I wouldn't advise traveling right now.

489
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:16,864
A bite like that can be pretty serious.

490
00:41:20,382 --> 00:41:24,212
<i>- Yes, that's the sign of the werewolf.</i>
<i>- That's just a legend though, isn't it?</i>

491
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:27,069
<i>Yes, but like most legends,</i>
<i>it must have some basis in fact.</i>

492
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:30,877
<i>Probably an ancient explanation</i>
<i>of the dual personality in each of us.</i>

493
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,442
<i>How does it go?</i>

494
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,382
<i>"Even a man pure in heart</i>
<i>and says his prayers by night...</i>

495
00:41:36,446 --> 00:41:39,316
<i>"may become a wolf</i>
<i>when the wolfsbane blooms...</i>

496
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:41,364
<i>"and the autumn moon is bright."</i>

497
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,613
You're reading. I'll get it.

498
00:41:44,575 --> 00:41:47,837
- Who's calling at 11:30?
- It's my phone, I'll get it.

499
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:49,528
I'll get it.

500
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,086
- You want me to get it?
- You get it!

501
00:41:58,399 --> 00:41:59,806
No, we're still up.

502
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:01,555
What?

503
00:42:02,974 --> 00:42:06,487
You're kidding me.
No, listen, we'll come right up, okay?

504
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,399
We'll be right up. Just calm down.

505
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,573
Okay. Bye-bye.

506
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,142
What is it?

507
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:16,244
Bill just got bitten by a wolf.

508
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:20,284
<i>... whoever is bitten</i>
<i>by a werewolf and lives...</i>

509
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,332
<i>becomes a werewolf himself.</i>

510
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,529
<i>Come on, Terry, it's only a movie.</i>

511
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:29,884
<i>You go on ahead and I'll be up as soon as</i>
<i>I pitch the special to the old man.</i>

512
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,798
<i>Relax, will you?</i>
<i>It was probably just some stray dog.</i>

513
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:35,259
- Hello, good friend.
- Hello.

514
00:42:35,327 --> 00:42:36,537
How are you?

515
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:37,785
Are you okay?

516
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,701
I don't know what her last name is.
Donna calls her Marsha the Man-Eater.

517
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,354
And she lives in this shack...

518
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:50,428
with these furry little animals
hanging from the rafters.

519
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:53,405
You think she's trying
to make the move on Bill?

520
00:42:53,598 --> 00:42:56,053
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

521
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,585
I sound paranoid, don't I?

522
00:43:01,342 --> 00:43:03,131
Karen, you sound fine.

523
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:08,308
God, no veggies.
I totally forgot about Bill and his dinner.

524
00:43:08,383 --> 00:43:13,117
Bill, I'm really sorry.
I totally forgot about you not eating meat.

525
00:43:13,502 --> 00:43:15,641
No sweat. It's terrific.

526
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:18,842
No, really. I get hungry enough,
I'll eat anything.

527
00:43:39,646 --> 00:43:41,469
Give me this book here.

528
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:46,236
I just thought maybe we'd<i>...</i>

529
00:43:47,455 --> 00:43:49,397
Your timing is incredible.

530
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:53,595
Sorry, honey. Those shots are...

531
00:43:58,942 --> 00:44:00,950
We're just out of sync, aren't we?

532
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,801
We never want the same thing
at the same time.

533
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,807
Goodnight, Bill.

534
00:44:29,887 --> 00:44:32,821
<i>Turn around, Karen.</i>

535
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:37,534
<i>What do you see?</i>

536
00:44:38,558 --> 00:44:40,282
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

537
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,253
Bill, it's<i>...</i>

538
00:44:48,414 --> 00:44:49,941
Screw you, then.

539
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:52,563
Jesus.

540
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:13,844
<i>Over here, Terry.</i>

541
00:53:11,515 --> 00:53:12,628
Hello?

542
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:16,794
Anybody here?

543
00:55:54,903 --> 00:55:56,081
Oh, God!

544
00:56:14,391 --> 00:56:15,568
Oh, God!

545
00:56:47,383 --> 00:56:48,397
No!

546
00:58:00,183 --> 00:58:01,907
Come on, Christopher.

547
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:10,252
Christopher, you're not
going to believe this.

548
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:19,986
I'm in the bathroom.

549
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:24,629
I had that dream again.

550
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:27,445
This time I think you were in it.

551
00:58:27,928 --> 00:58:30,383
No wonder, honey.
You've been asleep all day.

552
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:33,751
Jesus, where did you get
those scratches on your back?

553
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:39,054
I guess they're from the other night,
when I got attacked.

554
00:58:39,223 --> 00:58:41,645
They weren't there the other night.

555
00:58:42,775 --> 00:58:45,296
Karen, you're really getting paranoid.

556
00:58:48,215 --> 00:58:52,044
- You've been with her, that Marsha girl?
- Don't lay your fantasies out on me.

557
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:55,468
- I'm not gonna take that...
- I know, it's all a big conspiracy...

558
00:58:55,543 --> 00:59:00,278
You don't have one inch of backbone!
She walks by you like a bitch in heat...

559
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:06,221
Don't touch me.

560
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:18,476
I'm going over to Doc's and call Chris.

561
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:22,228
He'll come pick Terry and me up.
You can do whatever you want.

562
00:59:22,615 --> 00:59:25,931
- You don't know what it's like.
- I don't want to know.

563
00:59:32,567 --> 00:59:34,422
<i>... and Eddie Quist, he lives...</i>

564
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:38,065
Calm down. You're not making any sense.
Eddie Quist is dead.

565
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:41,237
I saw pictures just like we saw in his room.

566
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:44,045
Christopher, the landscape...

567
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:46,998
it's here at the Colony.

568
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:49,492
It's real.

569
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,757
- Where are you, at Doc's?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

570
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:56,687
Christopher, I'll tell you something.

571
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,080
I think he's got to be a part of this.

572
01:00:01,303 --> 01:00:03,986
Is there some kind of file cabinet there?

573
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:08,371
<i>Are you sure you're all right?</i>

574
01:00:08,695 --> 01:00:10,899
Yeah, I'm okay.

575
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:14,028
It sure is good to hear your voice.

576
01:00:14,935 --> 01:00:17,172
Look in the files under <i>"</i>Quist<i>."</i>

577
01:00:18,903 --> 01:00:20,725
You won't hang up, will you?

578
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:24,850
I'll get the police there as soon as I can.
Just go look in the file.

579
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:28,369
Okay, hold on.
Never mind, you're coming with me.

580
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,093
<i>"</i>Quist, Marsha<i>."</i>

581
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:45,837
<i>"</i>Quist, T. C<i>."</i>

582
01:00:50,871 --> 01:00:53,237
It's Eddie Quist.

583
01:01:19,959 --> 01:01:23,123
Operator, get me
the County Sheriff's Department, quick!

584
01:01:41,558 --> 01:01:43,151
No, don't bother.

585
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:47,796
I'll get hold of the state boys
and we'll meet you over at the center.

586
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:51,025
I wouldn't worry, Mr. Halloran.
I'm sure she's safe.

587
01:02:43,254 --> 01:02:46,963
Those are real silver. I got to check
with a jeweler to find out what to charge!

588
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,207
Bill me.

589
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:50,450
Crazy fuck.

590
01:03:02,773 --> 01:03:04,660
I got to use your phone.

591
01:03:06,837 --> 01:03:09,259
Jesus Christ, what happened in here?

592
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,321
- Hello, Karen.
- Eddie.

593
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:17,902
I'm glad you came.

594
01:04:18,517 --> 01:04:20,459
I wanted to see you again.

595
01:04:22,965 --> 01:04:24,394
I saw you die.

596
01:04:28,213 --> 01:04:31,595
You said on the phone
that you wanted to get to know me.

597
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,710
Here I am, Karen.

598
01:04:34,549 --> 01:04:35,858
Look at me.

599
01:04:39,253 --> 01:04:41,806
I want to give you a piece of my mind.

600
01:04:43,093 --> 01:04:44,817
I trusted you, Karen.

601
01:08:01,268 --> 01:08:04,683
Take it easy, pal.
Not all of us got enough money for a Mazda.

602
01:08:04,756 --> 01:08:06,828
Some of us have to work for a living.

603
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,136
I'm in a hurry here. This is an emergency!

604
01:08:15,252 --> 01:08:18,798
Come on out of there now, miss.
We've been waiting for you.

605
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,511
Took some persuading, did she?

606
01:09:45,907 --> 01:09:47,314
Where's Bill?

607
01:09:47,988 --> 01:09:49,394
He's one of us now.

608
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:52,755
In time, he would have brought you
over to us. Our secret will be safe.

609
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,609
It's wonderful, Karen.

610
01:09:54,772 --> 01:09:57,260
When I was first bitten, I fought against it.

611
01:09:57,331 --> 01:10:00,266
So did Jerry. And then we found the doctor.

612
01:10:00,628 --> 01:10:03,279
He helped us. He helped us to adjust.

613
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:06,510
You see, Karen,
he understands all about the gift.

614
01:10:07,476 --> 01:10:10,510
He knows how to use it, how to control it.

615
01:10:10,867 --> 01:10:14,184
You'd have Bill back.
There's still time if you accept the gift.

616
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,431
It was a mistake to bring her to the Colony.

617
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,769
We should have stuck with the old ways.

618
01:10:18,836 --> 01:10:21,935
Raising cattle for our feed.
Where's the life in that?

619
01:10:22,004 --> 01:10:25,452
- Humans are our cattle.
- Humans are our prey.

620
01:10:25,844 --> 01:10:28,495
We should feed on them,
like we've always done.

621
01:10:28,564 --> 01:10:31,378
Screw all this <i>"</i>Channel your energies<i>"</i> crap.

622
01:10:31,635 --> 01:10:33,675
But the danger of exposure<i>...</i>

623
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:38,701
We need this shelter to plan,
to catch up with society.

624
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:42,989
Times have changed and we haven't.
Not enough.

625
01:10:43,059 --> 01:10:44,466
Shut up, Doc!

626
01:10:48,276 --> 01:10:50,829
You wouldn't listen to me. None of you.

627
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,722
<i>"</i>We can fit in,<i>"</i> you said.

628
01:10:56,564 --> 01:10:58,386
<i>"</i>We can live with them<i>."</i>

629
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:01,260
You make me sick.

630
01:11:01,812 --> 01:11:03,568
You're through, Doc.

631
01:11:04,436 --> 01:11:05,897
She's ours now.

632
01:11:23,348 --> 01:11:27,025
See what your friend did to me that night?

633
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:31,597
What's the matter with you all? Have you
forgotten everything you've learned?

634
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:33,707
She can't disappear. She's well-known.

635
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:36,332
Right, we've got to make this
look like an accident.

636
01:11:36,404 --> 01:11:38,128
I won't let you do this.

637
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:48,554
You can't tame what's meant to be wild.
It ain't natural.

638
01:11:51,796 --> 01:11:55,854
<i>Violence is part of the human condition,</i>
<i>as history shows us.</i>

639
01:11:56,596 --> 01:12:00,305
<i>Coping with that fact,</i>
<i>living with it, presents each of us...</i>

640
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:06,635
<i>Fortunately, most of us are able</i>
<i>to deal constructively with those choices.</i>

641
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:10,027
<i>But for others, the animal lure of mayhem...</i>

642
01:12:10,484 --> 01:12:13,451
<i>the physical sensation</i>
<i>of life-and-death struggle...</i>

643
01:12:13,524 --> 01:12:15,346
<i>produces gratification.</i>

644
01:12:15,411 --> 01:12:18,445
<i>According to the autopsy reports,</i>
<i>Eddie's victims were bitten...</i>

645
01:12:18,516 --> 01:12:21,265
<i>almost as if</i>
<i>they had been attacked by an animal.</i>

646
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:23,600
<i>Doctor, what can you tell me</i>
<i>about lycanthropy?</i>

647
01:12:23,668 --> 01:12:25,806
<i>Where did you learn that term?</i>

648
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:28,909
<i>- On the</i> Late Late Show.
<i>- It's a mental disorder.</i>

649
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:33,006
<i>There are dozens of cases.</i>
<i>People like to walk about on all fours...</i>

650
01:12:33,076 --> 01:12:37,069
<i>to make bestial groans and sighs.</i>
<i>They prefer to eat raw meat.</i>

651
01:12:37,364 --> 01:12:39,982
<i>That certainly seems like</i>
<i>an awfully big coincidence...</i>

652
01:12:40,052 --> 01:12:43,630
<i>Karen being attacked by someone</i>
<i>with this kind of delusion.</i>

653
01:12:53,715 --> 01:12:56,017
<i>You're not going to believe this.</i>

654
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:58,543
<i>I've been attacked...</i>

655
01:13:04,212 --> 01:13:05,772
Hello, brave boy.

656
01:13:07,923 --> 01:13:09,069
Eddie?

657
01:13:10,164 --> 01:13:13,131
You know me, and I don't know you.

658
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:15,823
- Now why is that?
- Where is she?

659
01:13:16,468 --> 01:13:18,475
Why? Is she your girlfriend?

660
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:20,777
Where's Terry?

661
01:13:21,555 --> 01:13:24,425
Just down at the ritual center,
down the path.

662
01:13:25,268 --> 01:13:27,657
That's where Waggner sends us to...

663
01:13:28,468 --> 01:13:30,450
unwind.

664
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:33,644
- He's so repressed.
- What did you do to her?

665
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:37,233
She's got a sexy voice.

666
01:13:38,066 --> 01:13:40,368
I like a woman with a sexy voice.

667
01:13:44,434 --> 01:13:46,344
Listen to this part here.

668
01:13:47,314 --> 01:13:48,776
You are crazy.

669
01:13:50,482 --> 01:13:52,937
I'm much more than that, bright boy.

670
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:54,599
I'm much more.

671
01:13:56,402 --> 01:13:57,449
Here.

672
01:13:58,322 --> 01:13:59,500
Take it.

673
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:03,592
Call it a gift.

674
01:14:06,994 --> 01:14:08,684
Come on, bright boy.

675
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,097
Don't you know anything?

676
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:31,952
Put her and her friend in the car...

677
01:14:32,018 --> 01:14:36,458
pour gasoline over them, set fire to them,
and push them off the Coast Road.

678
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:42,475
Chris, run! They'll kill you!

679
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,355
That gun won't do you any good, mister.

680
01:14:49,202 --> 01:14:50,991
Don't come any closer.

681
01:15:29,202 --> 01:15:30,958
I have silver bullets in here.

682
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,481
Silver bullets, my ass.

683
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:35,727
Get up, T.C.

684
01:15:46,194 --> 01:15:47,601
They're real.

685
01:15:53,297 --> 01:15:56,014
Don't come any closer, Doc, please.

686
01:16:05,362 --> 01:16:06,639
Thank God!

687
01:16:20,529 --> 01:16:22,220
Karen, get the door!

688
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:26,375
Take the rifle.

689
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:35,628
Come on!

690
01:16:38,002 --> 01:16:41,318
- Is that the only door in the barn?
- Yeah, I think so.

691
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:45,862
- Where's Terry?
- They killed her.

692
01:16:46,162 --> 01:16:47,722
And I think Bill.

693
01:17:45,906 --> 01:17:47,182
Take this.

694
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:56,071
Get it started!

695
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:17,777
- How'd you find out about them?
- Terry called, right after...

696
01:18:17,842 --> 01:18:19,598
Stop, it's Sam.

697
01:18:28,338 --> 01:18:29,385
Duck!

698
01:18:47,217 --> 01:18:48,941
I smell gas. Come on.

699
01:18:57,425 --> 01:18:58,854
Give it to me.

700
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:03,339
Come on!

701
01:19:12,721 --> 01:19:14,150
Lock the door!

702
01:19:39,472 --> 01:19:40,454
Go!

703
01:20:09,136 --> 01:20:11,307
We have to warn people, Chris.

704
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:13,705
We have to make them believe.

705
01:20:25,583 --> 01:20:28,104
There! I'm an artist. You look terrific!

706
01:20:28,944 --> 01:20:30,635
I know you are. Thanks.

707
01:20:31,183 --> 01:20:33,572
If you're done, Fran, thanks a lot.

708
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:46,471
- I'm not sure I can go through with this.
- You have to.

709
01:20:46,543 --> 01:20:48,518
Okay, stand by on the set.

710
01:20:48,687 --> 01:20:51,917
Five, four, three, two<i>...</i>

711
01:20:52,944 --> 01:20:53,958
<i>Good evening.</i>

712
01:20:54,031 --> 01:20:57,479
<i>More word on that fire that's burning</i>
<i>out of control up the coast tonight.</i>

713
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:01,381
<i>Firefighters have discovered the blaze</i>
<i>seems to have started at the Colony...</i>

714
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:03,244
<i>an experimental living community...</i>

715
01:21:03,312 --> 01:21:06,378
<i>founded by author and behavior expert,</i>
<i>Dr. George Waggner.</i>

716
01:21:06,447 --> 01:21:07,691
She's ready.

717
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,248
How does she look?
Does she look all right to you?

718
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,037
<i>Reports so far indicate</i>
<i>that bodies have been discovered...</i>

719
01:21:13,104 --> 01:21:15,438
<i>both inside and outside</i>
<i>the Colony buildings...</i>

720
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,892
<i>many of them burned beyond recognition...</i>

721
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:21,928
<i>in what authorities on the scene are calling</i>
<i>a Guyana-like spectacle.</i>

722
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,928
<i>Now for an exclusive eyewitness report</i>
<i>on the incident, we welcome back...</i>

723
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,644
If she shows any sign of freezing,
like the last time, go right to commercial.

724
01:21:29,711 --> 01:21:30,922
Take one.

725
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:33,774
Good evening.

726
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:38,150
From the day we're born...

727
01:21:38,255 --> 01:21:39,979
there is a battle we must fight.

728
01:21:40,047 --> 01:21:43,724
<i>A struggle between</i>
<i>what is kind and peaceful in our natures...</i>

729
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,280
<i>and what is cruel and violent.</i>

730
01:21:46,352 --> 01:21:48,174
What the hell is this, an editorial?

731
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,508
That choice is our birthright
as human beings...

732
01:21:50,575 --> 01:21:54,088
and the real gift
that differentiates us from the animals.

733
01:21:54,992 --> 01:21:57,261
<i>It is as natural to us as the air we breathe...</i>

734
01:21:57,327 --> 01:22:00,327
Did you pass this material?
She's not reading from the prompter.

735
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,254
We changed it a little bit.

736
01:22:02,383 --> 01:22:04,325
But now, for some of us...

737
01:22:04,783 --> 01:22:07,053
that choice has been taken away.

738
01:22:07,824 --> 01:22:09,798
A secret society exists...

739
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:12,714
and is living among all of us.

740
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:17,354
<i>They are neither people nor animals...</i>

741
01:22:17,424 --> 01:22:19,693
<i>but something in between.</i>

742
01:22:20,304 --> 01:22:23,086
<i>Monstrous mutations,</i>
<i>whose violent natures...</i>

743
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:25,802
- Ready one, take one.
<i>...must be satisfied.</i>

744
01:22:26,416 --> 01:22:30,060
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>because I've been where you are...</i>

745
01:22:30,127 --> 01:22:31,982
- That's enough.
- Leave it.

746
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:33,803
- Leave it? Cut!
- Leave it!

747
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:35,497
But I have proof...

748
01:22:37,103 --> 01:22:39,820
and tonight I'm going to
show you something...

749
01:22:41,263 --> 01:22:42,954
to make you believe.

750
01:22:53,712 --> 01:22:55,500
Holy shit!

751
01:23:04,175 --> 01:23:05,582
What is this?

752
01:23:05,999 --> 01:23:10,025
- What are you kids watching?
- The news lady's turned into a werewolf.

753
01:23:10,832 --> 01:23:12,009
Oh, boy!

754
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,447
Switch, damn it!

755
01:23:41,327 --> 01:23:42,985
<i>Doesn't that look good?</i>

756
01:23:43,055 --> 01:23:46,765
<i>Tender, meaty chunks</i>
<i>of tantalizing nutrition...</i>

757
01:23:46,831 --> 01:23:49,384
Things they do with special effects
these days!

758
01:23:49,455 --> 01:23:51,822
Did you see the one
about the guy in the spaceship?

759
01:23:51,887 --> 01:23:53,131
It was real.

760
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:56,069
She turned into a werewolf,
and they shot her.

761
01:23:57,391 --> 01:23:58,951
You're plastered!

762
01:23:59,663 --> 01:24:01,256
Doesn't mean it wasn't real.

763
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:05,517
Ernie, put a pepper steak on for me,
and a hamburger for the lady.

764
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:08,550
- How do you want that?
- How do you want it, honey?

765
01:24:12,015 --> 01:24:13,063
Rare.

766
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,443
<i>Go now...</i>

767
01:26:35,183 --> 01:26:36,874
<i>and heaven help you.</i>
