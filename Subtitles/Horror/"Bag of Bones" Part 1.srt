557
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:17,684
Sweetheart, what were you thinking?

558
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,790
- I wanted to go swimming!
- [Sighs]

559
00:46:20,672 --> 00:46:21,987
Her name's Kya?

560
00:46:23,407 --> 00:46:26,081
Kyra, but sometimes I call her Ky.

561
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:27,729
Oh.

562
00:46:28,443 --> 00:46:30,931
- I'm... I'm Mattie Devore.
- Hi, Mattie.

563
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,956
- I'm not a bad mother. I swear to God.
- No, I didn't say you were.

564
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:35,395
Please don't mention this to anybody.

565
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:37,482
We're... we're going through
a little bit of a hard time.

566
00:46:38,474 --> 00:46:40,457
Yeah, well, I think
it's a little late for that.

567
00:46:44,296 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah.

568
00:46:45,564 --> 00:46:47,318
Well, thanks for saving
my little girl.

569
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:49,350
I guess God sent you here
at the right time.

570
00:46:49,402 --> 00:46:51,319
God's got nothing to do with it.

571
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:56,357
I was just going to Buddy
Jellison's for a hamburger.

572
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:58,142
[Both chuckle]

573
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,911
This is a little bit weird
for me, but, uh,

574
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:02,530
you're one of my favorite writers.

575
00:47:02,615 --> 00:47:04,616
And I can't believe you just
showed up out of nowhere

576
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:05,834
and saved my little girl!

577
00:47:05,918 --> 00:47:07,752
Oh, thank you.
And you know who I am?

578
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,337
Of course.

579
00:47:09,422 --> 00:47:11,790
You, uh, inherited
that house on the lake,

580
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:12,791
but you haven't been back since...

581
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:15,159
Yeah, since my wife died.

582
00:47:15,161 --> 00:47:17,212
[Quietly] Yeah.

583
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:21,139
Well, um, you take care
of yourself now, okay?

584
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,488
Stay out of the road.
Nice to meet you, Mattie.

585
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,720
Nice to meet you.

586
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,893
- Bye.
- Bye!

587
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:31,113
Bye, Kyra!

588
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:41,574
[Tires screech]

589
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,301
Hey.
Hey, uh, you want a menu?

590
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,638
Uh, I was told
to order a villageburger.

591
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,306
One villageburger coming right up.

592
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,808
Uh, what do you want on it?

593
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:02,211
Everything.
And a local brew.

594
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:04,263
Grab a seat.
We'll bring it to you.

595
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,065
Thank you.

596
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,902
Villageburger, aud!
And drag it through the garden.

597
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:13,506
[Sighs]

598
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:15,358
See you made a new friend
this afternoon.

599
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:18,061
Yeah, yeah.
Two, actually.

600
00:48:18,745 --> 00:48:24,084
I hear that Mattie Devore can be
quite a dear in the right position.

601
00:48:25,608 --> 00:48:26,317
Yeah.

602
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:29,409
You hear a lot,
old-timer?

603
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:32,533
More than you know, son.

604
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:35,793
Old don't mean dead.

605
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:44,735
Thank you.

606
00:48:47,212 --> 00:48:48,916
[Sighs] You'd do well
to keep your distance

607
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,766
from Mattie Devore,
Mr. Noonan.

608
00:48:52,056 --> 00:48:53,046
- Mm.
Uh-huh.

609
00:48:54,589 --> 00:48:55,939
How do you know my name?

610
00:48:56,163 --> 00:48:58,128
We don't see a celebrity
here every day.

611
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:00,818
Yes, well, I'm hardly
what you'd call a celebrity.

612
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:04,338
Well, we take what we can get.

613
00:49:04,372 --> 00:49:06,791
I'm really sorry to hear about
what happened to your wife.

614
00:49:06,825 --> 00:49:09,493
Hmm.

615
00:49:09,495 --> 00:49:11,962
She was a doll.

616
00:49:11,996 --> 00:49:13,514
So when she'd come in here
and eat, uh...

617
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:15,165
Would she be alone?

618
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,351
Uh, I guess so.

619
00:49:17,502 --> 00:49:20,337
Or sometimes
with Bill Dean and his wife,

620
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,390
sometimes with Brenda Meserve,

621
00:49:23,442 --> 00:49:26,510
and maybe another friend or two.

622
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:29,113
"Another friend or two,"
huh? Yeah.

623
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,781
Maybe. Yeah.

624
00:49:30,816 --> 00:49:33,200
Why are you so interested in who

625
00:49:33,285 --> 00:49:35,202
your wife was eating with,
Mr. Noonan?

626
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:37,988
Mike. Mike.
Just... just call me Mike.

627
00:49:38,022 --> 00:49:42,660
I don't know, I guess
I'd just like to know

628
00:49:42,694 --> 00:49:44,962
what life was like
for a year on Dark Score.

629
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:47,531
You know, all those years that
I couldn't make it up here.

630
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,834
So...
Hmm.

631
00:49:49,868 --> 00:49:51,836
Anyway.

632
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,537
Mattie Devore...
She's a...

633
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:56,474
A nice enough girl,
only she can be trouble.

634
00:49:56,508 --> 00:49:58,375
That ain't fair, Buddy.

635
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:00,427
Mattie Devore's in trouble
and with the wrong people.

636
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:01,679
Person.

637
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,380
And who's that person?

638
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:04,849
Max Devore.

639
00:50:04,883 --> 00:50:07,268
He's a mean old son of a buck.

640
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:09,570
I mean, he owns that big,
uh, computer company.

641
00:50:09,604 --> 00:50:11,555
Multi-millionaire.

642
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:14,191
Yeah, I think I, uh, may have
seen him yesterday afternoon

643
00:50:14,225 --> 00:50:16,360
in the window
of that old resort up there.

644
00:50:16,394 --> 00:50:17,995
- Mm, warrington's.
- Mm, yeah.

645
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:21,248
Yeah, that's the fella.
Mean old cuss.

646
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:23,417
He wants custody
of the little girl, Kyra.

647
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:24,785
And why would he want to take
his daughter's little girl away?

648
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:26,453
- Daughter-in-law.

649
00:50:26,505 --> 00:50:28,873
Mattie married Devore's only son.

650
00:50:28,907 --> 00:50:30,925
- Devore had the boy
when he was 60-something

651
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:32,710
with some Vegas showgirl
who's no longer

652
00:50:32,744 --> 00:50:34,094
in the picture, of course.

653
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:37,848
- Oh, okay.
- And so about a year ago,

654
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,184
Lance, that's Devore's son,

655
00:50:40,218 --> 00:50:43,137
he goes a little Dark Score crazy.

656
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:45,022
What does that mean?

657
00:50:45,056 --> 00:50:47,658
He tried to drown the little girl.

658
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:50,361
His own flesh and blood.

659
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:51,896
And Mattie ended up killing Lance

660
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,448
just to protect the little girl,
and ever since then,

661
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:57,067
Devore's made it his mission
to take Kyra away from her.

662
00:50:57,101 --> 00:50:59,709
And what Max Devore wants,
Max Devore gets.

663
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,241
[Both laugh]

664
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:44,468

670
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:20,128
Hello?

671
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,864
Mr. Noonan?

672
00:53:24,107 --> 00:53:24,604
Yes?

673
00:53:25,511 --> 00:53:28,751
- I understand you met
my daughter-in-law today.

674
00:53:30,799 --> 00:53:33,428
Ah, this must
be Mr. Devore.

675
00:53:34,357 --> 00:53:36,531
Yes, well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

676
00:53:36,776 --> 00:53:39,144
I'm concerned about my granddaughter.

677
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:43,139
I was told there was
an incident in the road today.

678
00:53:43,249 --> 00:53:46,317
- Uh-huh.
How did you get my number?

679
00:53:46,335 --> 00:53:48,954
You were seen talking to them.

680
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:50,822
Yeah, I met a woman and a little girl

681
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,791
on the road this morning, yes.

682
00:53:52,825 --> 00:53:55,761
I stopped to ask directions
to Buddy Jellison's cafe.

683
00:53:55,828 --> 00:53:58,847
Don't lie to me,
Mr. Noonan.

684
00:53:58,881 --> 00:54:01,600
Why are you protecting
my daughter-in-law?

685
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:06,054
Did she promise you something, hmm?

686
00:54:06,272 --> 00:54:07,722
Listen to me,
Mr. Devore!

687
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:09,224
I don't like your tone of voice,

688
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:10,725
and I don't know how
you got my number,

689
00:54:10,777 --> 00:54:12,861
but you can shove it up
your ass, you understand?

[Knocking at door]

761
00:59:29,661 --> 00:59:31,892
- Mr. Michael Noonan?
- Uh-huh, that's me.

762
00:59:31,997 --> 00:59:32,716
This is for you.

763
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:35,082
Just take it.

764
00:59:38,437 --> 00:59:40,099
What is it?
A subpoena?

765
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:42,678
To appear in the offices
of Elmer Durgin,

766
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,333
<i>attorney-at-law and guardian
Ad Litem of Kyra Devore.</i>

767
00:59:45,644 --> 00:59:47,445
And it's my duty to remind you
of the penalty

768
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,530
should you fail to...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

769
00:59:48,614 --> 00:59:50,148
I'll be there.

771
00:59:53,402 --> 00:59:55,570
Let me give you a piece of advice.

772
00:59:55,621 --> 00:59:58,189
Don't mess
with Mr. Devore.

773
00:59:58,207 --> 00:59:59,541
Or he'll squash me like a bug?

774
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:01,242
[Scoffs] I believe the script says,

775
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:05,213
"let me give you a piece of advice.

776
01:00:05,297 --> 01:00:08,633
Don't mess with Mr. Devore,
or he'll squash you like a bug."

777
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:10,301
That's right,
you can say stuff like that

778
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:12,137
because you're the hot shot
book writer.

779
01:00:12,204 --> 01:00:16,174
[Clicks tongue] That it?

780
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:18,893
[Sighs] I'll see you
at the deposition, Noonan.

781
01:00:18,978 --> 01:00:21,729
Sounds good.

783
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:43,751

help her?

785
01:00:57,216 --> 01:01:00,251
Is that what you're trying to say, Jo?

786
01:01:00,269 --> 01:01:03,421
Help Mattie Devore?

Is that you?

796

Sara?

Is that you?

798
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:52,335
I think we might have company, Jo.

You didn't think you and your wife

were alone, did you, baby?

833
01:04:33,713 --> 01:04:37,767
You want me, just like all them boys.

What boys?

835
01:04:41,555 --> 01:04:43,222
You'll see, baby.

You'll see.

Help her.

01:05:29,019 --> 01:05:31,136
Who?

842
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:35,140
Mattie?

843
01:05:35,158 --> 01:05:38,577
And write.

844
01:05:38,612 --> 01:05:44,450
You have to write.

845
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:47,503
I can't write.

846
01:05:47,537 --> 01:05:51,156
I can't write without you, Jo.

847
01:05:51,174 --> 01:05:53,992
I'll help you now.

848
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:56,795
I promise.

I still love my wife.

854
01:06:36,933 --> 01:06:38,614
Then you should do what she says.

855
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:41,322
Didn't she tell you to help me?

856
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:47,319
That's not what she meant.

857
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:53,470
[Whispers]
You have no idea what Jo meant.

858
01:06:53,505 --> 01:06:56,507
No idea.

Michael Noonan.

<i>As you know, I'm Kyra Devore's
guardian Ad Litem.</i>

869
01:07:35,966 --> 01:07:37,904
You know what that means,
Mr. Noonan?

870
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:41,988
You've been appointed by
the judge to decide what's best

871
01:07:42,072 --> 01:07:43,956
for Kyra, should a custody trial
become necessary.

872
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:46,942
Very good.

873
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,995
And the judge would not,
in such a case,

874
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:52,149
be required to base his decision
on my conclusions.

875
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:55,279
But that's usually what happens.

876
01:07:56,169 --> 01:07:59,639
[Electric whirring]

877
01:08:07,598 --> 01:08:09,632
Sorry to be late, Elmer.

878
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:12,944
George had trouble getting here.

879
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,715
Let's turn to your first meeting

880
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:18,505
with Mattie and Kyra Devore
on the highway, shall we?

881
01:08:18,716 --> 01:08:19,405
Sure.

882
01:08:20,327 --> 01:08:22,314
Kyra Devore was all alone.

883
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,259
Her mother wasn't with her, right?

884
01:08:24,288 --> 01:08:25,866
- That's a poorly-phrased
question,

885
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,371
but I suppose the answer is yes.

886
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:30,661
I'm flattered to have
my grammar corrected

887
01:08:30,685 --> 01:08:32,029
by a best-selling author.

888
01:08:33,136 --> 01:08:34,692
Is this
a better-phrased question?

889
01:08:35,382 --> 01:08:37,027
You could have run Kyra Devore over

890
01:08:37,028 --> 01:08:39,529
'cause she was playing in
the middle of the road, correct?

891
01:08:39,694 --> 01:08:41,445
The phrasing isn't better, no.

892
01:08:41,652 --> 01:08:43,199
And my answer is absolutely not.

893
01:08:43,681 --> 01:08:44,832
I was driving the speed limit.

894
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,625
I saw Kyra in plenty of time.

895
01:08:46,781 --> 01:08:48,147
So it's your experience
that most people obey

896
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,816
the speed limit
on that stretch of the road?

897
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,534
I haven't spent that much time
on Dark Score Lake.

898
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,086
I can't say.

899
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,988
Even in your limited experience,

900
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:58,357
do you think that most people
obey the speed limit

901
01:08:58,475 --> 01:08:59,659
on that road, Mr. Noonan?

902
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,994
I haven't done
a traffic survey. Sorry.

903
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:06,232
Okay, Mr. Noonan.
Then answer me this.

904
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:09,201
If you hadn't carried
Kyra Devore to safety,

905
01:09:09,236 --> 01:09:11,187
isn't it possible that
she could've been hit

906
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,506
by another car?
[Whispers] Just wait.

907
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,842
You know what?

908
01:09:15,893 --> 01:09:18,611
I left my crystal ball at home.

909
01:09:18,646 --> 01:09:21,497
[Chuckles] I really can't say.

910
01:09:21,499 --> 01:09:23,316
I'd like to remind you

911
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,368
you're under oath,
Mr. Noonan.

912
01:09:25,402 --> 01:09:27,287
I'd like to remind you that
I answered your question,

913
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:31,023
leading as it was.

914
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:34,327
Under oath...

915
01:09:34,361 --> 01:09:37,463
[Sighs]

916
01:09:37,498 --> 01:09:39,916
Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Durgin.

917
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,385
If you're on Kyra Devore's side,

918
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:45,088
why does it actually seem that
you're working for Max Devore?

[Taps gavel]

920
01:09:51,879 --> 01:09:55,565
This meeting is adjourned.

921
01:10:01,722 --> 01:10:04,274
This isn't over yet, Noonan.

922
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,276
Oh, thank God, Max.

923
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,827
It's just starting to get fun.

924
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:10,914
I couldn't agree more.

925
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:25,211
Mike!

926
01:10:25,245 --> 01:10:27,263
Hi.

927
01:10:27,298 --> 01:10:29,716
Thank you!

928
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,301
It's...
Yeah.

929
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,753
It's my pleasure.
Really.

930
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,773
I have to pick up Kyra from day care.

931
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:38,391
Would you like to walk me to my car?

932
01:10:38,425 --> 01:10:41,427
Sure.

933
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,529
Why not?

934
01:10:43,564 --> 01:10:47,200
So are you working on a new book?

935
01:10:47,234 --> 01:10:48,484
- Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

936
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:50,036
Oh, my God, I'm so lame.

937
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,771
That must be
the most annoying question,

938
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,457
right up there with, "where
do you get your ideas from?"

939
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,210
<i>That is an annoying question.</i>

940
01:10:57,244 --> 01:10:58,912
The one about working on a new book?

941
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,297
Well, that's just...

942
01:11:01,332 --> 01:11:02,318
Writer's block?

943
01:11:04,952 --> 01:11:07,921
Mm.

944
01:11:07,955 --> 01:11:09,555
Yeah.

945
01:11:09,623 --> 01:11:11,758
My next book,

946
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:13,309
the one that's coming out
this winter...

947
01:11:13,344 --> 01:11:15,294
<i>Yeah, I know about it.
Red shirt man, right?</i>

948
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,629
Yeah.

949
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,681
I wrote that book over a decade ago.

950
01:11:19,206 --> 01:11:20,323
It's a trunk novel,

951
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,936
a book I never thought
should see the light of day.

952
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:24,971
I passed it off to my agent
as a new novel

953
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:28,491
just to keep my little...
[Sighs]

954
01:11:28,525 --> 01:11:30,026
Dilemma a secret.

955
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,911
Nobody knows it's an old book?

956
01:11:31,946 --> 01:11:34,313
Nobody but you.

957
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:37,533
Well, your secret's safe with me, sir.

[Chuckles]

959
01:11:40,955 --> 01:11:45,091
My agent, my little agent Marty,

960
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:46,676
after he read
the first couple of pages,

961
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,999
he called me up and, uh...
[Laughs]

962
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:54,020
You know what he...?
[Laughs]

963
01:11:54,072 --> 01:11:55,539
- You know what he said?
- What?

964
01:11:55,573 --> 01:11:57,824
This is the best thing
I've written in years.

965
01:11:57,858 --> 01:12:00,661
Well, call it classic Michael Noonan.

966
01:12:00,712 --> 01:12:02,295
Yeah, you could do.

967
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:05,966
Marty would, you know.
But Marty lies.

968
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,335
All the time.
[Chuckles]

969
01:12:08,369 --> 01:12:09,636
He always wants to say
the right thing,

970
01:12:09,671 --> 01:12:13,590
but says the wrong thing.

971
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:16,643
Thomas Hardy said that...

972
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:19,396
Compared to the dullest human
being walking on the earth,

973
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:22,683
the most brilliantly drawn
character in any novel

974
01:12:22,717 --> 01:12:27,387
is nothing more than a bag of bones.

975
01:12:27,405 --> 01:12:29,222
The only problem is that
sometimes I feel like

976
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,526
nothing more than
a bag of bones myself.

977
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,228
A bag of bones without
the energy or the... the talent

978
01:12:35,246 --> 01:12:37,447
to do what I thought I was born to do.

979
01:12:37,532 --> 01:12:39,132
I...

980
01:12:42,903 --> 01:12:44,571
I don't think I can write anymore.

981
01:12:44,589 --> 01:12:48,542
You miss her a lot, don't you?

982
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:50,844
Yeah.

983
01:12:50,878 --> 01:12:53,680
I saw her once.
She was very beautiful.

984
01:12:53,715 --> 01:12:56,133
Where did you see her?

985
01:12:56,184 --> 01:12:58,051
At warrington's.

986
01:12:58,085 --> 01:12:59,936
I was, uh, a waitress there.

987
01:12:59,971 --> 01:13:02,255
And I was working a shift
with my friend Laurie wilton,

988
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:06,526
and... and I saw her, and I said,
"there's Mrs. Noonan,

989
01:13:06,561 --> 01:13:10,147
the writer's wife.
Isn't she pretty?"

990
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:11,481
I think Laurie was more interested

991
01:13:11,532 --> 01:13:13,316
in the guy your wife was sitting with.

992
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:16,203
What guy?

993
01:13:16,237 --> 01:13:17,454
He was just a guy, I guess.

994
01:13:17,488 --> 01:13:21,324
- Oh.
- Did I say something wrong?

995
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:23,443
Yeah, I mean, who was the guy
having dinner with my wife?

996
01:13:23,461 --> 01:13:25,078
I'm... I'm sorry.
I, um...

997
01:13:25,112 --> 01:13:26,797
No, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

998
01:13:26,831 --> 01:13:31,752
It's just...
I'm sorry.

999
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:33,386
It's just...
[Clears throat]

1000
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:35,222
After Jo died,

1001
01:13:35,256 --> 01:13:39,125
I found out she was pregnant.

1002
01:13:39,143 --> 01:13:42,846
[Sighs] Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.

1003
01:13:42,897 --> 01:13:44,297
No, no.
It's not your fault.

1004
01:13:44,315 --> 01:13:48,802
It's just...Messy.
Complicated.

1005
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,687
Plus the fact...

1006
01:13:50,772 --> 01:13:53,690
I keep thinking that Jo...

1007
01:13:53,775 --> 01:13:58,128
That she brought me here.

1008
01:13:58,179 --> 01:14:00,046
After she died, she brought you here?

1009
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,182
For a reason.

1010
01:14:02,216 --> 01:14:07,086
Like what?

1011
01:14:08,392 --> 01:14:10,997
I don't know...
Yet.

1012
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,151
Crazy, right?
[Laughs]

1013
01:14:15,799 --> 01:14:17,014
Not to me.

1014
01:14:17,236 --> 01:14:19,254
Yeah, well,
maybe she did bring me here

1015
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:20,969
so she could finally tell me what...

1016
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,594
She was doing here.

1017
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:29,231
Or maybe it's to get you
to write again.

1018
01:14:30,604 --> 01:14:31,313
Yeah.

1019
01:14:32,975 --> 01:14:34,256
Maybe you're right.

1020
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:42,998
Okay.

Look at you.

1025
01:15:08,973 --> 01:15:10,471
Just look at you.

1026
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:12,318
Hmm.

1027
01:15:22,154 --> 01:15:23,028
All right.

1028
01:15:24,035 --> 01:15:25,552
Let's just move that there.

1029
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:27,780

1030
