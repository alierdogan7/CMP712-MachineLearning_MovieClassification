01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:34,948
#<i>I want to feel the fire #</i>

1176
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:38,610
#<i>But I want to be the fire #</i>

1177
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:42,656
#<i>I know you'll be ready #</i>

1178
01:37:42,757 --> 01:37:46,625
# <i>When my daughters fly #</i>

1179
01:37:46,728 --> 01:37:50,425
# <i>You rush to kill</i>
<i>the feeling #</i>

1180
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:54,433
#<i>But you will now</i>
<i>need healing #</i>

1181
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:58,130
# <i>Will you be ready</i>
<i>oh #</i>

1182
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,072
# <i>To do or die #</i>

1183
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:05,134
# <i>'Cause pain can't hurt you #</i>

1184

1186
01:38:12,487 --> 01:38:16,014
# <i>With the</i>

1189
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:27,561
# <i>Yeah the pain's</i>

1190
01:38:27,669 --> 01:38:32,106
#<i>For your empty soul inside #</i>

1191
01:38:39,814 --> 01:38:42,840

1196
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:59,488
#<i>I'm only half human</i>
<i>oh #</i>

1197
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,866
# <i>When the day is done #</i>

1198
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:07,805
#<i>My only friend's</i>
<i>black coffee #</i>

1199
01:39:07,909 --> 01:39:11,868
#<i>She tells the walls</i>

1200
01:39:11,979 --> 01:39:15,506
#<i>My only peace of mind</i>

1201
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:18,676
#<i>From a smoking gun #</i>

1202
