A little wine.

Why are you doing this to me?

This decanter of the finest

This decanter of the finest
scotch that money can buy,

532
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,466
This decanter of the finest
scotch that money can buy,
right now.

533
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:19,903
Scotch that money can buy,
right now.
50,000.

534
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:20,871
Right now.
50,000.
>> this is what, a test?

535
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:21,805

It's not real.

536
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,674
>> this is what, a test?
It's not real.
>> oh, no... [chuckles]

537
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:25,776
It's not real.
>> oh, no... [chuckles]
I am deadly serious, conway,

and you know that I am.

I am deadly serious, conway,
and you know that I am.
The glass of wine or the whole

540
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,385
And you know that I am.
The glass of wine or the whole
damn decanter.

541
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,552
The glass of wine or the whole
damn decanter.
Now, it seems to me that the

542
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:38,689
Damn decanter.
Now, it seems to me that the
wine is... That's pretty simple,

543
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,524
Now, it seems to me that the
wine is... That's pretty simple,
isn't it?

544
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,660
Wine is... That's pretty simple,
isn't it?
But the scotch.

545
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:48,098
Isn't it?
But the scotch.
Well, we could consider that a,

546
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,902
But the scotch.
Well, we could consider that a,
a momentary lapse to...

00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:55,906
Well, we could consider that a,

Regarding tonight's game.
Please allow me to alleviate any

Please allow me to alleviate any

>> well, it is not a quiz or a

563
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:05,175
>> what exactly is the game?
>> well, it is not a quiz or a
trivia contest, nor is it a test

564
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,410
>> well, it is not a quiz or a
trivia contest, nor is it a test
of brute strength or

565
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,145
Trivia contest, nor is it a test
of brute strength or
athleticism.

566
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,646
Of brute strength or
athleticism.
At its core, it's just a

567
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,115
Athleticism.
At its core, it's just a
children's game, and I would

568
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,484
At its core, it's just a
children's game, and I would
wager that some of you here this

569
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:16,086
Children's game, and I would
wager that some of you here this
evening have played "would you

570
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:20,357
Wager that some of you here this
evening have played "would you
rather?" at some point.

571
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,828
Evening have played "would you
rather?" at some point.
So, how do we play?

572
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,965
Rather?" at some point.
So, how do we play?
In each round, each player

573
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,933
So, how do we play?
In each round, each player
will be given a choice between

574
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:34,338
In each round, each player
will be given a choice between
"a" or "b", uh, and usually, uh,

575
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,939
Will be given a choice between
"a" or "b", uh, and usually, uh,
neither choice is very

576
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,940
"a" or "b", uh, and usually, uh,
neither choice is very
attractive.

577
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,108
Neither choice is very
attractive.
Let's see if I can give you

578
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,278
Attractive.
Let's see if I can give you
an example: Travis.

579
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,381
Let's see if I can give you
an example: Travis.
Travis, would you rather...

580
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:49,253
An example: Travis.
Travis, would you rather...
Kiss iris or peter?

581
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,788
Travis, would you rather...
Kiss iris or peter?
[scattered chuckling]

582
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,722
Kiss iris or peter?
[scattered chuckling]
[chuckles]

583
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,490
[scattered chuckling]
[chuckles]
>> guess I'd kiss iris.

584
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,458
[chuckles]
>> guess I'd kiss iris.
>> very good.

585
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,361
>> guess I'd kiss iris.
>> very good.
Now, this is where our version

586
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:58,862
>> very good.
Now, this is where our version
of the game is different.

587
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:02,199
Now, this is where our version
of the game is different.
Whatever you choose, you <i>must</i>

588
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:05,235
Of the game is different.
Whatever you choose, you <i>must</i>

589
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:08,372
Whatever you choose, you <i>must</i>

597
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:22,853

598
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:25,722

<i>Now, as the game continues,</i>
<i>with one dilemma after another,</i>

00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:28,492
<i>Now, as the game continues,</i>

01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:36,064
Really.
Do tell.
>> this is gambling 101

1331
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:36,831
Do tell.
>> this is gambling 101
right here.

1332
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:37,832
>> this is gambling 101
right here.
You just gotta look for the

1333
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:38,533
Right here.
You just gotta look for the
patterns.

1334
01:10:38,535 --> 01:10:39,200
You just gotta look for the
patterns.
It's all patterns,

1335
01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:43,338
Patterns.
It's all patterns,
it's psychology.

1336
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,172
It's all patterns,
it's psychology.
And drowning does sound

1337
01:10:44,174 --> 01:10:45,707
It's psychology.
And drowning does sound
pretty bad.

1338
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:47,976
And drowning does sound
pretty bad.
So, I'm guessing you think

1339
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:49,777
Pretty bad.
So, I'm guessing you think
I'm gonna choose the envelope to

1340
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:50,845
So, I'm guessing you think
I'm gonna choose the envelope to
avoid "duggins" holding me

1341
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:51,813
I'm gonna choose the envelope to
avoid "duggins" holding me
underwater for two minutes and

1342
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:54,515
Avoid "duggins" holding me
underwater for two minutes and
drowning, is that it?

1343
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:55,683
Underwater for two minutes and
drowning, is that it?
>> bevans.

1344
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:58,686
Drowning, is that it?
>> bevans.
>> whatever.

1345
01:10:58,688 --> 01:10:59,687
>> bevans.
>> whatever.
If you were facing a normal

1346
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:00,421
>> whatever.
If you were facing a normal
player, that's exactly what

1347
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,390
If you were facing a normal
player, that's exactly what
you'd do.

1348
01:11:02,392 --> 01:11:03,458
Player, that's exactly what
you'd do.
Put something really shitty in

1349
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,593
You'd do.
Put something really shitty in
that envelope, so all the other

1350
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,763
Put something really shitty in
that envelope, so all the other
players think twice.

1351
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:09,897
That envelope, so all the other
players think twice.
But I know you.

1352
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,232
Players think twice.
But I know you.
You've looked into my past.

1353
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:12,233
But I know you.
You've looked into my past.
So you know all about my

1354
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:15,670
You've looked into my past.
So you know all about my
gambling experience.

1355
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:16,838
So you know all about my
gambling experience.
So you probably have anticipated

1356
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,672
Gambling experience.
So you probably have anticipated
that I was gonna figure

1357
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:18,640
So you probably have anticipated
that I was gonna figure
this out.

1358
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:19,774
That I was gonna figure
this out.
>> come on, come on, come on,

1359
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:20,575
This out.
>> come on, come on, come on,

1360
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:22,443
>> come on, come on, come on,

Your time is running out.

1361
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,544
Make a decision.
Your time is running out.
>> the envelope.

1362
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:24,379
Your time is running out.
>> the envelope.
Obviously.

1363

>> the envelope.
Obviously.
[paper rustling]

1364

Obviously.
[paper rustling]

>> [sighs]
what is this?
>> oh.

1366
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:43,831
What is this?
>> oh.
You have to light off a

1367
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,434
>> oh.
You have to light off a
firecracker in your hand.

1368
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:47,935
You have to light off a
firecracker in your hand.
That's it.

1369
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:49,470
Firecracker in your hand.
That's it.
>> [sighs] good.

That's it.
>> [sighs] good.

>> [sighs] good.
[chuckles]

1372
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,511
[chuckles]

Gambling 101.

1373
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:57,679
See?
Gambling 101.
Why are you pointing a gun in

1374
01:11:57,681 --> 01:11:58,346
Gambling 101.
Why are you pointing a gun in
my face?

1375
01:11:58,348 --> 01:12:02,350
Why are you pointing a gun in
my face?
I'm agreeing to this.

1376
01:12:02,352 --> 01:12:10,124
What the hell is this?
>> you have to light it, peter.
It's what the envelope says.

1377
01:12:10,126 --> 01:12:11,092
>> you have to light it, peter.
It's what the envelope says.
>> but it's not a firecracker.

1378
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:13,494
It's what the envelope says.
>> but it's not a firecracker.
That's a quarter stick.

>> but it's not a firecracker.
That's a quarter stick.
>> you know, you're right.

That's a quarter stick.

Maybe you ought to move away

>> you know, you're right.
Maybe you ought to move away
from the table.

Maybe you ought to move away
from the table.
You're gonna make an awful mess.

1383

From the table.
You're gonna make an awful mess.
>> let it go before it goes off.

You're gonna make an awful mess.

You know, peter, maybe it's
a dud.
Did you think about that?

1393
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:54,001
A dud.
Did you think about that?
Did you consider that?

Did you think about that?
Did you consider that?
And of course, we won't know

And of course, we won't know
