1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,803
Johnny.

2
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,443
Johnny.

3
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,451
Johnny.

4
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,991
Harry!

5
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,924
How are you?

6
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,434
Hello?

7
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,874
Yes, this is Harold Angel.

8
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,241
Yep, middle initial "R,"
just like in the phone book.

9
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:04,976
Excuse me? Winesap.

10
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,542
Herman Winesap
of Winesap and Mackintosh.

11
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,055
Hold on a second.

12
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,726
Okay, Winesap...

13
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,161
of Winesap and Mackintosh.

14
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,732
Okay, I got it.

15
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:26,537
Of course I know
what an attorney is.

16
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,540
Yeah, it's like a lawyer,
only the bills are bigger.

17
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,038
Sure, I'll hold. Asshole.

18
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,646
Mr. Winesap, yeah,
Harold Angel.

19
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,060
Well, yeah, I could be free.

20
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,188
Well, would this be with your firm?

21
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,565
Okay, give me that again.

22
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,936
Louis.

23
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,941
How do you spell that?

24
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,571
Cyphre. Okay.
What is it, foreign?

25
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:12,549
A foreigner? Is your client
a foreign gentleman?

26
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,420
Okay.

27
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,013
Well, Mr. Winesap, could you give me
a few more details?

28
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,521
Okay.
No, I know the place.

29
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,626
Well, it's a long way up,
but I can be there.

30
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,454
Hallelujah!

31
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,716
Permit me to be transmittable,
hallelujah.

32
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,317
Permit me to be reincarnatable,
hallelujah.

33
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,024
Permit me to be reproducible,
hallelujah.

34
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,303
For His kingdom is yours,
today, right now.

35
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:10,468
Hallelujah. Follow me.
Follow me through his paths.

36
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:14,137
Hallelujah. I want you to show right now
how much you love God.

37
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,341
I want you to show
as your tithe.

38
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,283
I want you to open up your hearts
and open up your wallets.

39
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,787
And open up your purses.
And open up your pockets.

40
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,290
And give it up.
Praise the Lord.

41
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,761
Somebody's been talkin' about me, about
I've been riding around in a Cadillac.

42
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,457
If you love me,
and you wanna give to me...

43
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,898
then I should be
in a Rolls Royce.

44
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,466
Let's hear it, Brother. Let's go. Yes!

45
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:44,907
Hey! Hey! Come on.

46
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,310
- Mr. Angel?
- Yeah.

47
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,611
Herman Winesap.

48
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,811
Would you come
with me, please?

49
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,133
An unfortunate husband...

50
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,362
of one of Pastor John's flock
took a gun to his head.

51
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,371
Most unpleasant.

52
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,867
Mr. Angel? Please?

53
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,132
Mr. Angel.

54
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,934
Allow me to introduce my client,
Monsieur Louis Cyphre.

55
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,530
Hiya. Harry Angel.

56
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,076
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Angel.

57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,017
I don't want to appear rude or impolite,
but do you have any I.D., before we begin?

58
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,212
Sure. Yeah. Here.

59
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,290
Let me see what I got here.

60
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,484
How's that?

61
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,438
Nothing personal. It's just
that I'm a little overcautious.

62
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,169
- You know how these things are.
- Oh, I know.

63
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,737
So, how did you hear about me?

64
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,850
I guess you guys just looked
in the phone book, huh?

65
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,596
Usually that's what happens.

66
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,029
Because my name is Angel.
It's under A's.

67
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,328
People...
You know, people are lazy.

68
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,403
They flick through.
They see the first name in the book.

69
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,496
- Johnny Favorite.
- Excuse me?

70
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:58,008
Do you by chance remember
the name Johnny Favorite?

71
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,204
Remember the name Johnny?
No, I don't think so.

72
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,715
- You never knew him?
- Am I supposed to know him?

73
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,809
He was a crooner before the war.
Quite famous in his way.

74
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,654
Well, I'll tell ya,
Mr. "Cyphre," you know, l...

75
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,825
Mr. Cyphre.

76
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,319
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

77
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,300
Mr. Cyphres. I usually don't get
involved in anything really heavy.

78
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,566
I usually handle
small-time stuff:

79
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,234
Insurance jobs, divorces,
things of that nature.

80
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,110
I get lucky,
sometimes I handle people.

81
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:39,173
But I don't know no,
you know, crooners...

82
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,776
or anybody famous, you know?

83
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,915
- His real name was Liebling.
- I don't...

84
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,319
I don't know
any Liebling either.

85
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,328
So what is it you guys
want from me?

86
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,160
- Does this man owe you money?
- Not quite.

87
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,395
I gave Johnny some help
at the beginning of his career.

88
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,701
So were you, like, his...
his agent?

89
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:06,744
No, no, no.
Nothing so...

90
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,906
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.

91
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,782
Certain collateral was involved, to be
forfeited in the event of his death.

92
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,320
You're losin' me a little bit.
Are we talkin' about a guy who's dead?

93
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,516
No, he was drafted in '43.
North Africa.

94
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,083
Special Entertainment Services.
There was an attack.

95
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,390
He was badly injured
about the head and face.

96
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,730
- He had...
- Amnesia, I think you call it.

97
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,998
- Shell shock?
- Shell shock. Yes.

98
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,438
- I know how that feels.
- Why? Were you in the services?

99
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,476
Yes, I was in
for a short period of time.

100
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:43,845
But I got a little fucked up real quick.
Excuse my language.

101
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,884
And they shipped me
back home...

102
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,283
and I sort of missed
the whole shebang.

103
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,515
You know, the war, the medals,
the whole nine yards.

104
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,592
And I guess you could say
I was lucky.

105
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:57,561
Well, Johnny wasn't so lucky.
He returned home a virtual zombie.

106
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:02,396
Favorite's friends had him transferred
to a private hospital upstate.

107
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:06,301
There was some sort of radical
psychiatric treatment involved.

108
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,169
Favorite's lawyers
had the power of attorney to...

109
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,676
Pay the bills, things like that.
But you know how these things are.

110
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,508
He remained a vegetable,
and my contract was never honored.

111
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,242
I see.

112
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,615
I don't want to sound mercenary
or anything, but you must understand...

113
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,780
that my interest in Johnny
is only in finding out if he's alive...

114
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,084
or if he's dead.

115
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:30,652
Each year my office receives
a signed affidavit confirming...

116
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,199
that Johnny Liebling is indeed
among the living.

117
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,167
Until this last weekend,
when quite by chance...

118
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:42,070
Monsieur Cyphre and I were in the vicinity
of the hospital just outside Poughkeepsie.

119
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:46,474
We decided to check for ourselves
but were given misleading information.

120
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,310
- Yeah, the runaround.
- Yes. I didn't want to cause a scene.

121
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,611
I hate to have any sort of a fuss.

122
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,050
So I thought perhaps you could...

123
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,612
subtly, in a more quiet manner...

124
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,284
- You want me to check it out.
- Check it out.

125
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,697
Okay. Yeah.

126
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,460
It's funny. I have a feeling
I've met you before.

127
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,995
I don't know.
I don't think so.

128
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,921
Do you by chance remember
the name Johnny Favorite?

129
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,862
His real name was Liebling.

130
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:48,197
My interest in Johnny is only in finding
out if he's alive or if he's dead.

131
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,779
- May I help you?
- Yes.

132
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:38,050
My name is Harry Conroy, and I'm
with the National Institute of Health.

133
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,554
Is there anyone in particular
you'd like to see, Mr. Conroy?

134
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:47,291
The Institute is conducting a survey
of incurable trauma cases...

135
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,426
and I understand you have a patient here
fitting that description.

136
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,134
I'm afraid we can't let you see anyone
without an appointment, sir.

137
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,004
Oh, sure. I appreciate that.
But maybe, you know...

138
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,840
you could check the files
and make sure I'm on the right track.

139
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,438
I don't want to bother
anybody unnecessarily.

140
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,644
Okay? Thank you.

141
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,849
- What's the name of the patient?
- Liebling. Jonathan Liebling.

142
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,255
One moment please.
I will check.

143
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,893
So, was you workin' here
last weekend?

144
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,900
No. Day off.

145
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,235
- Did you do anything nice?
- My sister's wedding.

146
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,733
We did have a Mr. Liebling...

147
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,074
but it says here
he was transferred.

148
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,148
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's what it says here.

149
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:41,550
- Well, when was that?
- Years ago. December '43.

150
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,986
May I take a look at this?
Thank you.

151
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,794
- Is this recent?
- It's an old file.

152
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:54,389
It's in ballpoint. You know, they
weren't too big on ballpoint in '43.

153
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,866
- Is that ballpoint?
- Yeah.

154
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,234
Well, I'll be.
They didn't have ballpoints back then?

155
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,307
No.

156
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,003
This here Dr. Fowler...

157
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,011
does he still work here?

158
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,638
Just part-time. He's old.

159
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,086
Thank you.

160
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,469
About time for your evening fix?

161
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,883
Who are you?
How'd you get in here?

162
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:04,179
Through the mail slot.
I'm a private detective.

163
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,688
Breaking and entering is a serious
crime, whoever or whatever you are.

164
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,820
Well, hey, man,
call the police.

165
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,865
Which you won't do in case
they discover your little opium den...

166
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,367
you got in the icebox there.

167
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,040
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled
to keep pharmaceuticals at home.

168
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,446
Hey, look, Doc, tell it
to somebody else, all right?

169
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,281
We're not talkin' about
a Band-Aid and two Bongateen.

170
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,049
- How long you been hooked?
- What do you want of me?

171
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,354
Information about Johnny Liebling.

172
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,187
I vaguely remember treating
a patient of that name many years ago.

173
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,266
Hey, look, Doc,
I'm not foolin' around here.

174
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:54,931
Either you start giving me some straight
answers, or I'll call the police myself.

175
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,908
I've seen the works cookin' upstairs,
pal, and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.

176
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,105
I remember. He was in detainer
during the war. Neuro case.

177
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:06,617
No chance of recovery. So we transferred
him to a V.A. Hospital in Albany.

178
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,380
Hey, Doc, I hate to shake you up,
but I checked with Albany.

179
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,753
He's not there.
You faked the transfer.

180
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,383
Well, I did that quickly
because he had a visitor recently.

181
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,429
In 12 years, he hadn't had a visitor.

182
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,226
Popular guy, huh?

183
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,796
- Where is he now?
- I honestly don't know.

184
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,099
Look. Come here.

185
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,835
I haven't seen him since
he was a patient in the war.

186
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,312
Look, Doc, you're in a cold sweat.
Look at you.

187
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,612
You can't wait for me to leave here so
you can raid the goodies in the icebox.

188
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,945
Now, the sooner
you get out with it...

189
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:47,151
the sooner you can shoot yourself
to Palookaville, okay?

190
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,591
I'm gonna ask you again.

191
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,595
Where is he?

192
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,961
I don't know.

193
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,500
Some people came one night
many years ago.

194
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,435
He got in the car with him and
drove away. I never saw him again.

195
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,029
He got into a car?
I thought this guy was a vegetable.

196
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,168
When he first came here, he was
in a coma, but he soon recovered.

197
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,212
But he still suffered
from acute amnesia.

198
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,847
The friends?
Who were the friends?

199
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,215
The gentleman's name was Kelly.
Edward Kelly.

200
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,018
The young lady, I don't know her.

201
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,887
- She stayed in the car.
- Where were they taking him?

202
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,019
I think down south. The man said,
"We're taking him home."

203
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,888
- What was the deal?
- $25,000.

204
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,023
For what?

205
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,000
To maintain the pretense that he was
still a patient in the hospital.

206
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,298
Well, didn't the administration suspect?

207
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,533
But why should they?
I kept the charts up to date...

208
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,078
and no one asks questions
when the bills get paid.

209
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,847
I want you to tell me
about Johnny Liebling.

210
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,385
- What did he look like?
- I have no idea what he looked like.

211
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,513
His face was damaged. He had
extensive facial reconstruction.

212
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,148
He was still in bandages
the day he left.

213
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,784
Tell me about this guy Kelly.

214
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,796
- It's so long. I have only a vague memory.
- Come on.

215
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,959
I can't remember. He was well-dressed.
He had a southern accent.

216
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,969
- L...
- What?

217
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,198
- Truly can't remember.
- All right, Doc. All right.

218
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,832
Hey. We're gonna have
a little lie-down, all right?

219
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,605
I'm gonna go out,
and I'm gonna grab a cheeseburger.

220
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,910
Maybe a few hours cold turkey
will refresh your memory. All right?

221
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,411
Come on.

222
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,457
Watch yourself there.

223
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,585
Okay, Doc. We're gonna
take a little nap now.

224
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,926
Sit your ass down.

225
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:36,125
I'm gonna clear your mind
a little bit.

226
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,567
I'm gonna go out.
Maybe when I get back...

227
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,935
I'll fix you some goodies
from the icebox, all right?

228
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,601
Listen, you tell me what I want to know,
I'll be out of your hair forever.

229
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,605
Johnny.

230
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,683
Harry. Harry.

231
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,087
Harry.

232
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,364
Hey, I'm back, Doc.
I brought you a little somethin'.

233
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,805
I didn't think you'd want
a cheeseburger and a shake.

234
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,689
- I won't. Bye.
- Bye.

235
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
- Hey, Allie.
- Hey, Harry.

236
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,327
That your boyfriend?

237
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,804
- He got a car and everything?
- Yeah.

238
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,841
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

239
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,842
- Ohh.
- Bye.

240
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,208
See you later.

241
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,678
- Did you see him?
- No.

242
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,844
- Why not?
- 'Cause it would have been difficult.

243
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:59,549
- Why?
- Why? 'Cause he's not there.

244
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:05,593
Your Johnny Favorite walked out of
Sarah Harvest Dodd's 12 years ago...

245
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,791
wearin' his best suit and a new face
wrapped in bandages.

246
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,130
With a headache.

247
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,502
He took off with some guy
called Kelly and a girl.

248
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,973
Do you know this Kelly?

249
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,379
Well, it seems that this guy
Kelly paid off...

250
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:26,473
some bent doctor called Fowler to
pinch-hit for your guy all these years.

251
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,213
He's been coverin' up
for him ever since.

252
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,957
It looks like our Johnny has found
himself a perfect disappearing act.

253
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,124
It seems so.

254
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,797
You know what they say about slugs.

255
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,140
No, what do they say about slugs?

256
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:53,039
They always leave slime in their tracks.

257
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:03,845
- You'll find him.
- No, I won't find him.

258
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,424
'Cause I left out one little detail.

259
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:15,193
This Dr. Fowler guy ended up dead with
his fuckin' brains blown out all over.

260
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,700
- Fowler?
- Yeah, Fowler.

261
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,498
- Did you kill him?
- No, I didn't kill him.

262
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,505
But the cops might think I did.

263
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:28,175
Hey, look. I took on $125 a day
missing persons job with you.

264
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,010
Now I'm a murder suspect.
That's it. I'm out.

265
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,110
Such are the hazards
of your profession, Mr. Angel.

266
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,520
If the fee bothers you,
we can have it adjusted.

267
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:43,151
No, Cyphre, you bother me.
Listen, the closest I ever come...

268
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:46,560
to death is standin' on the corner on
2nd Avenue watching the stiffs go by...

269
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,998
in the hearse, all right,
that's the way I like it.

270
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,070
Are you afraid?

271
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,403
Yeah, I'm afraid.

272
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,537
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately
to send you a check for $5,000.

273
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:05,582
If you don't want the job,
I'll engage someone else.

274
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,015
- $5,000?
- $5,000.

275
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,528
You must want this Johnny
pretty bad.

276
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,893
I don't like messy accounts.

277
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:31,671
You know, some religions think that
the egg is the symbol of the soul.

278
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,404
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

279
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,119
Would you like an egg?

280
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:49,416
No, thank you.
I got a thing about chickens.

281
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:04,233
I've got a higher plane

282
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:13,869
I've got a higher plane

283
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,843
Oh, yeah

284
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,306
- A higher plane
- Oh, yeah

285
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,206
I don't know why

286
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,505
I've found it

287
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:54,381
- I've got a higher plane
- Oh, l...

288
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,614
Gavilan weighs 146 pounds
tonight, just a pound...

289
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,016
under the welterweight limit.

290
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,520
Turner weighs 1441/2.

291
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:43,617
It's a $270,000 gate, an all-time
record for the welterweight title.

292
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,155
It's after 11:00, Harry.
You're late.

293
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,861
I'm sorry. Did you get it?

294
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,407
If I lose my job,
I'll come and be your secretary.

295
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:59,806
Hey, I couldn't pay you what the Times
pays. Besides, they're not gonna miss it.

296
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,778
They must be digging up stuff
like this all the time.

297
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,144
Hiya, Johnny.
Where the fuck are you?

298
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,416
Johnny Favorite was a crooner,
like you said.

299
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,248
I didn't realize he was so big.

300
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,688
He used to be in a band called
the Spider Simpson orchestra.

301
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:17,249
- All dead. Only Spider's here in town.
- Oh, yeah? Where is he?

302
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,626
I wrote it all down.

303
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,291
The dyke in Archiving's library
is getting suspicious.

304
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,664
My boss hasn't researched
a story in years.

305
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,760
You can get the files.

306
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:31,274
Spider's in an old people's home
on 138th Street.

307
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,276
Oh, wonderful.
I get to go to Harlem again.

308
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,040
There was a picture of Johnny
with a guy called Toots Sweet.

309
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,614
- A guitar player.
- And?

310
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:41,276
No one's heard of him for years.
Now here's the juicy bit.

311
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,617
He was engaged to a rich broad,
name of Margaret Krusemark.

312
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,212
Dad Ethan owns half of Louisiana.

313
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,657
Met Johnny at a high school prom
in New Orleans.

314
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,321
Johnny shit on her, and she went
back home to Daddy.

315
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,831
- Oh, yeah, there's lots under spells.
- Spells?

316
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,163
What do you mean, spells?

317
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:02,672
You mean like eye of a newt
and toe of a frog, that kind of shit?

318
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,674
Seems she's a bit of a crackpot.

319
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,041
Casting spells at society do's
and stuff.

320
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,775
Didn't go down too well
with the Ivy League stiffos.

321
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:16,411
Oh, yeah, she was known
as the Witch of Wellesley.

322
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,751
The Witch of Wellesley.

323
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:22,314
- Did I do good?
- Yeah, you did great.

324
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:27,490
So, what do I got? I got some kind
of religious loony for a client.

325
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,964
I gotta find Johnny Golden Tonsils.

326
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,630
We don't know where he is.
He probably doesn't know who he is.

327
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,937
I got a geriatric bandleader
at a home in Harlem.

328
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:42,479
I got a guitar player
called Toots Sweet.

329
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,845
- What else I got?
- A hard-on.

330
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,348
Are you okay?

331
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,924
January 3, 1955.

332
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:39,128
Copy: : Winesap and Mackintosh,
attorneys.

333
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,104
As reported,
Johnny Favorite has not been...

334
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:47,075
in the Sarah Dodd Nursing Home
of Poughkeepsie for the last 12 years.

335
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:51,638
He was taken away by a man
called Edward Kelly and a girl.

336
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,149
The girl is unidentified.

337
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:58,279
Kelly paid a Dr. Fowler $25,000
to falsify reports...

338
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,415
stating Favorite was still
at the hospital.

339
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:11,393
The doctor is now deceased.

340
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,632
Before Johnny's accident, it seemed
his career was goin' great...

341
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,471
till he started to dump
on everyone around him.

342
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,705
I tracked down Spider Simpson,
Johnny's old bandleader.

343
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,873
Spider now resides at
the Lincoln Presbyterian Hospice...

344
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:29,976
for the Elderly, on 138th Street.

345
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:34,581
Johnny also had a close buddy,
a guitar player called Toots Sweet.

346
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,592
Toots went back to Algiers.

347
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,687
That ain't Algiers in Africa.
That's Algiers in New Orleans.

348
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:45,758
I think maybe Margaret went
back there too, and maybe Johnny.

349
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:51,035
Oh, yeah. According to Spider,
Johnny had a secret love.

350
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:55,078
A black lady called
Evangeline Proudfoot.

351
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:59,980
Evangeline ran some kind
of spooky store in Harlem...

352
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,484
called Mammy Carter's.

353
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,655
You don't need
to know that, Cyphre.

354
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:16,290
I think secret loves
should stay secret.

355
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,899
And the only other person
Johnny was seeing regularly...

356
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:25,965
was a palm reader out in Coney Island
called Madame Zora.

357
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,931
Hey, you Izzy?

358
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,933
Yeah.

359
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,334
- It looks like the last of the sun, huh?
- Yep.

360
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,703
Hey, listen. The guy in the arcade over
there told me you might be able to help.

361
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,901
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

362
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,911
I'm lookin' for a Madame Zora.

363
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:05,312
Yeah, sure, I know her.
A friend of the wife before the war.

364
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,180
- It's the fortune teller, right?
- Yeah, and then some.

365
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,279
Real creepy. I hate those
hocus-pocus bitches. Fuckin' witch.

366
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,290
Her and the wife got along real well.

367
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,326
The wife's a Baptist. Oh, here.

368
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,053
Have a nose shield.
Go on. Take one.

369
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,862
I found a whole boxful
under the boardwalk.

370
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,903
There's not much sun
in the city right now.

371
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,665
Yeah, but it keeps the rain off too.

372
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,708
Hey, listen. You ever hear
of a Johnny Favorite?

373
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,573
- The singer?
- The crooner.

374
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,510
Used to visit Madame Zora
all the time?

375
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,014
I heard of him, but I don't know
nothin' about him.

376
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:42,415
Ask the wife. She'll know. She's always
singin' stupid tunes off the radio.

377
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,852
She knows all that kind of shit.

378
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,685
- She likes the water, huh?
- Nope. Hates it.

379
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,228
She's gettin' on the heavy side.
She thinks it's good for varicose veins.

380
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,223
All right. Thanks.

381
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,167
Listen. What do you do around here
in the summertime?

382
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,832
- I bite the heads off of rats.
- What do you do in the winter?

383
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,239
Same.

384
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,885
Excuse me!

385
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,483
I was just talkin'
to your husband over there!

386
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:27,792
I was inquiring about a Madame Zora!

387
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:31,163
Yeah, I knew her before the war.
Madame Zora, you say?

388
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:34,203
Yeah, she was some kind
of gypsy fortune-teller.

389
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,604
Yeah, she used to have the booth
across the boardwalk from me.

390
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,541
She weren't no gypsy.
She was a debutante.

391
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,874
She was messin' with more
than readin' tea leaves.

392
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,143
Did you ever see her with a guy
called Johnny Favorite?

393
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,517
Yeah, he was cute. Used to visit her
all the time. She was real stuck on him.

394
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:55,581
The guy with the golden tonsils, they
used to call him. I knew all his tunes.

395
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,924
Hey, did you ever hear of a...
of a Margaret Krusemark?

396
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:04,296
Don't be a gazoony, fella.
Madame Zora was Margaret Krusemark.

397
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,637
Well, what happened to her?

398
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:13,005
Packed up her stuff one day and closed
up for good. Went back home. Down south.

399
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,511
Do you have any idea where
I could find Johnny Favorite?

400
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,014
Nope.
Maybe the cemetery.

401
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,516
Wanna hear one of his tunes?

402
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:26,352
I cried for you

403
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:30,860
Now it's your turn to cry over...

404
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:33,429
Hey, thanks for the nose shield.

405
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,260
- Okay.
- I'm gonna need it where I'm goin'.

406
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,698
- In Brooklyn?
- Nah. Louisiana.

407
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,633
Nice.

408
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,428
Where'd he go?

409
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:41,109
Mr. Angel.

410
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,413
Sorry to keep you waitin'.
You're a little early.

411
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,956
Well, I had a bad line.
I didn't know if it was 4:00 or 4:30.

412
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,358
Wow, this is really
a wild place you got here.

413
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,798
Yes, I've been very happy here.

414
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,165
Hey, you know, I never
had my fortune read before.

415
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,637
- Does this take long?
- I'll just take the details now.

416
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,301
It usually takes me
a couple of days to do a chart.

417
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,613
Tea?

418
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,176
- Do you want some tea?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

419
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,693
Darjeeling, jasmine or oolong?

420
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,600
- Oolong.
- Not many people like oolong.

421
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,611
You play the piano?

422
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,280
No, not exactly.

423
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,817
Sing?

424
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:52,013
Well, I can carry a tune,
but not really.

425
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,089
So, who's this mean-looking guy?

426
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,898
It's my father.

427
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,967
Oh. I'm sorry.

428
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,127
Don't worry. He hates it too.

429
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:10,502
You know, he really looks like one
of those guys in an old pirate movie.

430
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,074
What's his name?

431
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:16,579
- Ethan.
- Ethan. Ethan Krusemark.

432
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,478
Well, I'll tell ya, you know,
I never saw any of Ethan's movies.

433
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,662
Do you speak French, Mr. Angel?

434
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,789
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- I'd prefer it if you didn't smoke.

435
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,597
Oh, that's okay.

436
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:45,573
- Cream or sugar?
- No. Straight up is fine, thank you.

437
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,440
Now. I'm gonna need
your exact date of birth.

438
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,445
Sure.

439
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,606
Okay, I was...

440
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,184
born February 14.

441
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,352
1918. That's Valentine's Day.

442
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,186
How curious.

443
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,322
I used to know a boy who was born
on that exact same date.

444
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,833
Oh? Really?

445
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,200
Well, you know how it is.
All the soldiers home on leave and all.

446
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:19,742
Hey, maybe we could pull your friend's
chart and save ourselves some time.

447
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,209
I don't think so, Mr. Angel.

448
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:26,373
Every person's very different.
I don't think you'd like his chart.

449
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:32,452
- Place of birth?
- Brooklyn, New York.

450
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,888
Why, was he a jerk
or something, your friend?

451
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,558
Yeah, you could say that.

452
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:44,729
So, I guess you just didn't get along.
You and Johnny.

453
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,907
You and Johnny Favorite?

454
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,213
Who are you?

455
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,480
I was an old army buddy.

456
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:08,024
I thought that you two
were kind of a... You know.

457
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,253
All right. Look.
I ain't no army buddy.

458
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,591
I'm just a guy who was
paid to snoop around.

459
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:17,963
But to tell you the truth, I wasn't born
on Valentine's Day.

460
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,435
It's Johnny's future
that I'm interested in.

461
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:25,030
Johnny has no future. He's dead.

462
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:28,339
He died 12 years ago, and Mr. Angel,
I'd like you to leave.

463
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:33,439
Look, I know you're probably thinking
who's this creep lookin' to snitch around.

464
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,144
I don't want to sound nosy
or nothin', but...

465
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:40,451
He's dead, Mr. Angel.
And if he isn't, he is to me.

466
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:44,994
Wow. He must've hurt you
pretty bad.

467
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:47,620
We all have our scars, Mr. Angel.

468
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,995
Well, look. You know, I don't know
too much about this guy...

469
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,967
but he must've been really stupid
if he let you go.

470
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,632
Lies and cruelty come very easy
to some people. Good-bye, Mr. Angel.

471
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:01,507
It's a pity. You know, I really would've
liked to have gotten my palm read.

472
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,410
Could've held your hand
a little while longer.

473
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,785
I don't think you'd like what I see.

474
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:16,219
That's a very pretty necklace
you got there.

475
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,488
- Hi.
- Hi.

476
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,193
You got any
Hygeia the Conqueror root?

477
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:56,824
- Powdered or hanging?
- I don't know. I'm not really sure.

478
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,370
- Caught in the rain, huh?
- Yeah.

479
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,872
Two roots. $1.20.

480
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:09,139
Listen, I have a question
I wanna ask you.

481
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,340
I have an acquaintance
back in Harlem...

482
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,441
who used to deal
in Hygeia the Conqueror root.

483
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:18,316
And her name was Evangeline.
Did you ever hear of her?

484
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,550
Practically everyone around here
is called Evangeline, mister.

485
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:24,650
After the poem.
You know the poem?

486
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,730
Yeah, I know the poem.
This...

487
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:32,234
This acquaintance of mine had a store in
Harlem. It was the same name. Carter.

488
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:37,330
Everybody uses the name, mister. Like
Howard Johnson? This is the real place.

489
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:42,970
Her name was Proudfoot,
Evangeline Proudfoot.

490
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,709
Yeah, I knew her.

491
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,411
She used to come back here all the time
when she was livin' in New York.

492
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,749
Well, do you know
where she is now?

493
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:56,121
She got sick. Died.
Went back to Holy Shelter Swamp.

494
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:59,593
They buried her in Almondville.
She was waitin' on some fella.

495
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,756
- Just like in the poem, huh?
- Just like the poem.

496
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,766
$1.20.

497
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,334
Well, who was the guy?

498
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,168
She never told.

499
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,111
Okay, thanks.

500
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:27,278
- A week, you say?
- Yeah, at most.

501
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:27,713
What you crying for?
What? What?

502
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,911
What you crying for?

503
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,786
Let's go see Grandma.
Who's over there?

504
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,791
It's Grandma. Grandma.

505
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,941
Let's go.

506
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,877
Give me your hand.

507
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,163
Soap.

508
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:41,515
Excuse me?

509
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:47,229
- Miss Proudfoot?
- Yeah.

510
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,331
Oh, I'm sorry.
I got these from some guy...

511
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,427
and it's funny
how some babies react to 'em.

512
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,943
- I'm sorry.
- Stop crying.

513
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:07,374
Listen, I was hoping maybe
I could talk with your mama.

514
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:11,352
Yeah? You're a little late for that.
Did you know her?

515
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,752
No, I've never met her,
but I was hoping...

516
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,519
maybe she could answer
a few questions for me.

517
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:20,926
- What are you? Some kind of cop?
- No. My name's Harry Angel.

518
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:25,195
How are you?
I'm a private detective.

519
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,463
- So what's...
- Epiphany.

520
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,972
- Epiphany?
- Yeah.

521
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,066
Your mama left you
with a very beautiful name, Epiphany.

522
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:37,305
- Not much else.
- Oh.

523
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,645
Well, actually, to be quite frank,
I'm looking for a friend...

524
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,514
of your mama's,
a guy called Johnny Favorite.

525
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,815
Yeah? I met all of mama's friends.

526
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,480
I never met anyone called Favorite.

527
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:54,159
Jesus. Oh, shit!
I got a thing about chickens.

528
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,692
Yeah. This guy Favorite.

529
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:03,432
He was friends with your mama,
back in New York City, before the war.

530
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,906
Yeah? She never told me.

531
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,477
My mama had a lot of guys.
She liked men.

532
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,274
How 'bout a guy
named Toots Sweet?

533
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:14,282
He was a friend of Favorite's.
Did you ever meet him?

534
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,614
He was supposed to be
a pretty good guitar player.

535
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,881
I was gonna go try
to catch his act tonight.

536
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,959
Well, listen, I'm gonna be stayin' here
in town, in a hotel.

537
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:30,294
And I figured if maybe, if you could
remember anything that might help me...

538
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,494
maybe you could give me a call.

539
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:44,710
You're a very pretty girl, Epiphany.
Your name suits you.

540
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:50,618
Chickens.

541
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,956
Hey, what are you after him for?
Johnny Favorite?

542
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:04,625
I'm not really after him. I'm just
being paid to find out where he is.

543
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,634
He could be six feet under.

544
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:10,499
Then I'll have to buy a shovel.

545
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:34,594
And I had one small cup of tea

546
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,958
You just walked out of my life

547
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,769
Left them low-down
dirty blues with me

548
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,945
It was on

549
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:57,281
Oh, Lord, it was on

550
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,378
On a rainy day

551
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,049
One time for Toots

552
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:07,124
It was on

553
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,791
- Oh, Lord it was on
- How's it hangin', sugar?

554
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,800
On a rainy day

555
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,267
Go ahead.

556
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,497
Hey, that was some beautiful tune
you were singing in there, Mr. Sweet.

557
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,502
- Toots, son. Thank you.
- Yeah, listen. Can I buy you a drink?

558
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,765
No, I get mine on the house.
Two Sisters cocktails.

559
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:53,001
Don't know what's in 'em, but I get
a bigger kick than I do six stingers.

560
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:56,670
Listen. You know that I heard
you play years ago in New York?

561
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,715
Yeah, it was before the war
at the old Dicky Wells bar.

562
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,716
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

563
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:06,812
You was hammin' it up pretty good
with some cat called Johnny Favorite.

564
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,323
Yeah, I vaguely remember
playin' with that guy once.

565
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,826
Yeah, you and him was buddies,
weren't you?

566
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,419
No. He made a record of one of my songs,
but that don't make us buddies.

567
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,863
Say, are you a dick or book writer?

568
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,434
I'm neither.
What I am, I'm a journalist.

569
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,697
You see, what I'm doing is,
I'm doing this piece.

570
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:25,434
The piece is on Johnny and
the old Spider Simpson Orchestra.

571
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:29,342
I remember Spider. He used to play them
drums like two jack rabbits fuckin'.

572
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,038
Got to go, son.
Ain't got much time.

573
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:35,049
A piss and a spit and back to work.
Try one of them Two Sisters cocktails...

574
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,585
and then you can make the whole
thing up, any way you want to.

575
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,986
That's what you newspaper people
do anyway, don't you?

576
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:53,727
He starts his lovin'
when you get through

577
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,103
Can't even take a piss.

578
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,807
Hey, look, pal. I just wanted
to have a little talk...

579
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,145
with you about Johnny Favorite
and Evangeline Proud...

580
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,481
I'm too big to go hidin' under beds.
I don't know nothin'.

581
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:14,421
Two Sisters cocktails are the only thing
I'm interested in nowadays. Fuck!

582
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,606
- What's going on, Toots?
- Nothing.

583
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:35,166
Mind your own business.
I wanna piss.

584
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,441
If you don't get the hell out of here,
I may clean you out on the sidewalk.

585
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:40,573
You gonna wish your little
white ass never was born.

586
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,844
Please.
I got a thing about chickens.

587
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:48,049
So take a tip, honey
And just leave my door

588
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:52,856
Because your key don't fit
in my lock no more

589
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:55,328
You got the right key

590
00:58:55,431 --> 00:59:01,597
You're knockin' on the wrong door

591
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,498
Zu Zu Mamou

592
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,534
With your pigtail on

593
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:37,629
Say somebody crossed you
Now your mind is gone

594
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,470
If it hurts you too bad

595
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,568
Call for help

596
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:47,412
Don't be ashamed to call a doctor when
there ain't nobody left to tell ya now

597
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,649
Zu Zu Mamou

598
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,050
All right, now. Hey.

599
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:48,062
This is the end of bullshit time,
pal, okay?

600
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:50,132
I got a good look
at you and Epiphany...

601
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,930
doin' your hot-shoe number
with the chicken.

602
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,799
And listen.

603
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:59,102
I ain't up on all this voodoo shit.
I'm from Brooklyn.

604
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,802
We ain't all Baptists
down here, sonny.

605
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:03,902
What's the story
with this Proudfoot girl?

606
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:08,416
She's a mambo priestess, like her mom.
Has been since she was 13.

607
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,612
When's the last time you saw Johnny
Favorite at one of those chicken stuffings?

608
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:13,951
He used to run around
with Mom Mambo, didn't he?

609
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:17,355
I told you, I ain't seen him
since before the war.

610
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,587
What about the chicken foot
in the john, huh?

611
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:23,893
- Means I got a big mouth.
- Not big enough, Toots.

612
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,527
What's this fuckin' star you wear
in your mouth? I'll tell you what.

613
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:32,165
I'm gonna give you my hotel number,
and you give me a call...

614
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,641
in case you hear anything.

615
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,672
You never know,
the next time you get...

616
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:42,308
a special delivery chicken foot,
you may need a little help.

617
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,285
I'll tell you, as far as I'm concerned...

618
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,323
any dead chicken's
a good chicken to me.

619
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,098
Hey, only cops and bad news
don't knock.

620
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,225
Only private dicks sleep so late.

621
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,327
That's quite a dream you were having.

622
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:46,033
I was on my way to Mandalay again.

623
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:51,608
Shit. That's some leak you got up there.

624
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,349
Here. This your name?

625
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:08,854
- Yeah.
- That your hotel?

626
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:12,162
- You're standin' in it, ain't you?
- Your handwritin'?

627
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,994
I think so.

628
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,436
Then perhaps you'd like
to tell us why...

629
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:21,271
we found that in the hand
of a dead guitar player?

630
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:29,582
- Toots Sweet is dead?
- Yeah. Toots Sweet.

631
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:32,449
Only this one weren't so quick.
This one took time.

632
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,089
How did he die?

633
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:39,059
Technically, asphyxiation
by his own genitalia.

634
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,829
But not so technically.

635
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:45,492
Somebody cut his dick off, stuffed it
in his mouth and choked him to death.

636
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,593
Took to redecoratin' his apartment
with the poor jerk's blood.

637
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,298
So, when'd you see him, Angel?

638
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:55,070
- I interviewed him yesterday around 1:00.
- In connection with what?

639
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,668
Missing person.

640
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,374
Who?

641
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:04,943
Some cat took a walk 12 years ago. I saw
Toots in an old photograph with him.

642
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,487
What's the name of this party
you're lookin' for?

643
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,580
Sorry, friend. Can't say.
That's right of privacy.

644
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,387
- I'm workin' for a New York lawyer.
- Name?

645
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,860
Ah, come on, man.

646
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:17,399
Winesap. You want his number,
you want his address?

647
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,333
Ask Tess Trueheart over there.
It's in the book he's flickin' through.

648
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,700
It's under "W," genius.

649
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,069
You know Ted Williams,
the baseball player?

650
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,199
Yeah.

651
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:30,638
Herman Winesap.

652
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,211
All right, is that it, guys?

653
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:39,480
That's it.

654
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:42,489
You and your "right to privacy"
can go eat lunch.

655
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:43,990
But don't stroll too far, Angel.

656
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:46,891
Not till we talk
to this lawyer of yours.

657
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:57,366
You ever watch
the Mickey Mouse Club?

658
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:02,502
'Cause you know what today...
today is?

659
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:07,742
Today is Wednesday.
It's "anything can happen" day.

660
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,169
Hey, man, you want a tune?

661
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,804
Yeah, I got a tune for you.

662
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,305
Hiya, boys.

663
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:16,674
Ah, same to you.

664
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:20,312
Hey, I'm gettin' kind of hungry.
You wanna sell some of those things?

665
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,083
Hey, Pop.

666
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,898
- Ten cents a sack.
- Sure, man, give me a sack.

667
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:38,164
Ah, shit! Get...

668
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:56,690
You listen good, mister.

669
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:59,852
Margaret Krusemark's old man
wants you on that train home.

670
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,396
Get that fuckin' thing
away from me!

671
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:07,094
If you don't, my dog here's gonna
bite your fuckin' face clean off.

672
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,526
What happened to you?

673
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,655
A dog bit me.

674
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:38,858
Yeah, so?
What do you want?

675
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:42,736
Well, right now, l...
I need a laundry.

676
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,069
- Listen, "Epithany."
- Epiphany.

677
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,633
Epiphany. I got something
on my mind I wanna ask you.

678
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:53,442
Yeah. The other night
I saw you and Toots Sweet...

679
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:57,212
boogyin' with the cock-a-doodle-doo
out in the woods.

680
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,514
Looked like you all
were havin' some party.

681
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,784
Yeah, so what's your problem?
It's a free country.

682
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,222
Not for chickens it ain't.

683
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,794
Oh, yeah, you got a thing
about chickens. I remember.

684
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,831
Listen, Epiphany,
Toots is... Toots is dead.

685
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,833
I know. I heard.

686
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:15,096
- And you set him up.
- No, I didn't.

687
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:18,764
You were the only one
that knew I was seein' Toots.

688
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:22,901
Yeah. You're the one that sent the
gift-wrapped chicken for two, aren't you?

689
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:25,377
Yeah, well, Toots had a big mouth.

690
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,109
I guess he did, judgin' by
what the cops found in it.

691
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:30,650
Quite a cute religion you got.

692
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,915
Well, nailing a man to a cross
ain't so cute, either.

693
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,013
Yeah, I know. You got to kill
a chicken to make the soup.

694
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:42,063
We don't go around murdering people,
all right? What about Johnny Favorite?

695
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:45,327
Oh. So now you remember
him after all, huh?

696
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,732
Yeah, he was my father.

697
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,331
Mince?

698
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,342
Mince, I'm gonna pick
the baby up later, okay?

699
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:56,411
He's gonna be all right.

700
01:16:56,511 --> 01:17:01,574
Hey, look, if you got anything you're
holding out, now's a good time to tell.

701
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:03,913
Nothing to tell.

702
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:07,580
Johnny never came back
from the war.

703
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:11,250
Mama waited. Mama died.
It's sad and simple.

704
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:15,595
Epiphany, there's too many
dead bodies floatin' around...

705
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,688
even for Louisiana.

706
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,962
I'd tell your old man
to look out for you.

707
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:24,232
- You do have a husband.
- No. No husband.

708
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:29,069
Jesus, you got
beautiful eyes, Epiphany.

709
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,941
You really do.
They're truly beautiful.

710
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:36,484
They're the kind of eyes you can tell
just what's goin' on inside.

711
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:39,315
- Right now you're scared.
- I manage.

712
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:46,683
- Hey, well, listen...
- Yeah. I'll call you if I hear anything.

713
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,990
Hey.

714
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,121
Call me if you don't.

715
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,401
All right?

716
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,692
I have a message for you.

717
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,859
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

718
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:26,951
I'm so glad you could come.

719
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:29,758
Yeah. I didn't know
you were comin' to town.

720
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:31,526
I have a speaking engagement
in Baton Rouge...

721
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,727
and I thought it would be opportune
to catch up on your progress.

722
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:37,134
I'm tellin' ya...

723
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,503
Progress ain't too good.

724
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,270
I found out a lot of stuff.

725
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:46,074
But so far, no Johnny Favorite.

726
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:47,808
How unfortunate.

727
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,611
All I got is a bellyful
of hocus-pocus...

728
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:52,744
and three stiffs.

729
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,822
- Stiffs?
- Yeah.

730
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:58,450
Dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.
Murders.

731
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,687
- Murders.
- Yeah.

732
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:07,768
I got Fowler... Johnny's doctor
bumped himself off.

733
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:11,236
I got this old voodoo guy,
Toots Sweet.

734
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:15,867
He got choked to death with a part
of the body meant for pissing with.

735
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:17,877
This is a church, Mr. Angel.

736
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,482
Well, I'll tell you something.
I know it's a church...

737
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,778
but there's a lot of religion
going around with this thing.

738
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:28,288
It's very weird, and
I don't understand it. It's ugly.

739
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,255
They say there's just
enough religion in the world...

740
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:33,122
to make men hate one another,
but not enough to make them love.

741
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:35,128
Oh, is that what they say?

742
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:38,028
Well, I'll tell you something,
Mr. Cyphre, there...

743
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:40,693
wasn't too much love around
for Johnny Favorite.

744
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:45,000
All right, that guy was bad luck
and it's starting to rub off on me.

745
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,700
I'm a murder suspect
already in two cases.

746
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:51,802
The police found my name
and my address in Toots Sweet's hand.

747
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:54,643
I know.
Winesap told me.

748
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:57,547
You must be careful, Mr. Angel.

749
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:00,018
And a third? You said
there were three murders.

750
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:04,888
I checked out Johnny's little society
girlfriend... Margaret Krusemark.

751
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:08,326
- Do you know her?
- Vaguely.

752
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:13,094
Vaguely? Let me tell you, I'm a little
fed up with fuckin' "vaguely."

753
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:16,602
"Vaguely" is puttin' a noose around
my neck and I'm startin' to choke.

754
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,765
So, Mr. Cyphre,
did you know her or not?

755
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,367
I knew about her,
but I never actually knew her.

756
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:25,173
All right. Well,
I'll tell you what.

757
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,047
She was doin' my chart. I gave her
Johnny's birth date... February 14...

758
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:36,115
Except someone got to her and took
out their own Valentine's card.

759
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:39,921
They split her open
and they cut out her heart.

760
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:45,532
I guess she couldn't predict
the future for herself.

761
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:48,296
The future isn't
what it used to be, Mr. Angel.

762
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,803
- And your conclusions?
- I haven't any.

763
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,740
All I know is Johnny's runnin' around
bumpin' off everyone he used to know.

764
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:58,370
And more and more it's me
who's on the line for it.

765
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,881
I'm bein' set up, and it's scarin'
the shit out of me, all right?

766
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:05,919
So why don't you just tell me and level
with me what the fuck is goin' on here?

767
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:11,482
Just Johnny Favorite and the debt
that's owed to me, Mr. Angel.

768
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,994
I have old-fashioned ideas
about honor.

769
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:17,826
You know, an eye for an eye,
things like that.

770
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:21,295
Who the fuck are you, Cyphre?

771
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,963
Watch your language.

772
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:27,599
Hey, I don't give a fuck
if this is a church, okay?

773
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:30,075
Churches give me the creeps.
I don't like churches.

774
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:33,375
- Are you an atheist?
- Yes, I am.

775
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,847
I'm from Brooklyn.

776
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,043
I'll be in town for a day or two.

777
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:40,746
Let me know what else you find,
and if you need money...

778
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,517
No, no, the money's fine.

779
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,822
But if I ain't careful, that
5,000 bucks you gave me...

780
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:49,920
could just buy me a seat
on the electric chair.

781
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,968
Hi.

782
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,868
Frightened eyes never lie.

783
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,669
Come on.
Come on inside.

784
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:44,082
- Where's your child?
- He's with Mincy.

785
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:45,709
She's bringing him over later.

786
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:49,517
She's got 14 of her own,
so he'll be okay there.

787
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:54,687
Look, Epiphany, you're very welcome
to stay here or I'll get you a room.

788
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:56,787
No, I'm okay.

789
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:59,890
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna
have a drink. You want a drink?

790
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:04,703
You're gonna have one anyway.

791
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,603
- I've been thinkin', Epiphany.
- Yeah?

792
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:15,445
I was wondering what the hell your mama
ever saw in a guy like Johnny Favorite?

793
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,883
I don't know. Whatever he had,
he sure stole her heart away.

794
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:23,654
To tell you the truth,
the guy was a creep.

795
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,749
Well, she sure missed him.

796
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,454
I mean, I'll tell ya.

797
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:32,294
What does a lady see in a guy that runs
around choppin' up pigeons, you know?

798
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,027
You know what they say.

799
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:37,571
It's always the badass that makes
a girl's heart beat faster.

800
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:42,774
Did she ever say
anything about him?

801
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:45,038
- Johnny?
- Yeah.

802
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,842
- Just two things.
- Yeah, like what?

803
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:53,650
She once said that Johnny Favorite
was as close to true evil...

804
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:56,121
as she ever wanted to come.

805
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:59,785
- What else did she say?
- He was a terrific lover.

806
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:06,628
How old are you, Epiphany?

807
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,464
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.

808
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:13,371
That's kind of young
to have a kid, isn't it?

809
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,137
It's old enough.

810
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:20,413
- So, where'd the father go?
- I never knew him.

811
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:25,479
I'm sorry. To tell you the truth.

812
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:29,045
I don't know why
I took this room.

813
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,819
It was at Bamboucher.

814
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,329
When the spirits possess you,
it's called chevalier.

815
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:40,890
Oh, yes, I'm familiar
with that... Chevrolet.

816
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,166
- Chevalier.
- That's what I said: Chevrolet.

817
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:47,173
Mounted by the gods.

818
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:50,438
- Oh, so the gods got you pregnant?
- Yeah.

819
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:52,445
I understand that. Sorry.

820
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,981
I'm not. It was
the best fuck I ever had.

821
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,072
Want to dance?

822
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,142
In here?

823
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:23,540
Yeah, here.

824
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:32,176
I got bit by a dog this mornin'.
I can't move around.

825
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:36,018
Well, you won't feel a thing.

826
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:40,025
- Well, I'll dance with you.
- Yeah?

827
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,119
- Yeah. But you gotta promise.
- What's that?

828
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,130
No chickens.

829
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:47,360
- Okay.
- Come on. Jump on.

830
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:58,177
And I really

831
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,304
Had my fun

832
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:04,408
With all the boyfriends

833
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:07,852
The good time men friends

834
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:12,052
I've still had to walk this road

835
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,822
All by myself

836
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:18,126
I was that playgirl

837
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,828
A careless gay girl

838
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:24,928
But I put

839
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:28,167
Them all on the shelf

840
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:32,110
I found my true love

841
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:35,808
With you forever

842
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,977
And my life

843
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,318
Has just begun

844
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,051
'Cause now you've set

845
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:46,990
My soul

846
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,893
On fire

847
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:53,195
And I really

848
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:56,395
Had my fun

849
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:59,996
Good-bye to playboys

850
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:03,544
Those hey-hey-hey boys

851
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:08,014
Good-bye to everyone

852
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,516
But you, my love

853
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:13,109
Well, no more heartaches

854
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:17,890
No more heartbreaks

855
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:20,927
I'll swear by all

856
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:24,021
The stars above

857
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:27,260
Well, all my soul

858
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:30,599
My love, my heart

859
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,806
I miss you, darling

860
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,777
But I'm coming up

861
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,906
'Cause now you've set

862
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:44,610
My soul

863
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,949
On fire

864
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:18,809
All right, I'm comin'.

865
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:23,817
I should've recognized the knock.

866
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:26,751
Well, at least you got reason
for sleepin' late this time.

867
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:29,152
Down here, Angel, we don't
mix with the jigaboos.

868
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:31,384
The colored folks
keep to themselves.

869
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:33,653
Well, hey, I ain't from down here.

870
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:36,321
- You cut yourself?
- A dog bit me.

871
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:40,891
Somebody named Margaret Krusemark
figure in this missing persons case?

872
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,734
- No. Why?
- She's dead.

873
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:48,570
That nigger guitar player of yours,
he don't matter a shit.

874
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:51,577
He was into voodoo.
They 86'd one or two a week.

875
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:56,241
This Krusemark dame, she comes from
a Louisiana money family... white money.

876
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:59,842
So two people get bumped off in
the same week. What's the connection?

877
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:02,320
- Similar circumstances.
- Like what?

878
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:04,687
Did she get her dick cut off too?

879
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:08,694
No. Some fucker cut her heart out,
neat as a butcher on Decatur Street.

880
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:12,129
Look, mine's a missing persons. It's not
a murder, okay? Why you telling me this?

881
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:14,793
I want to know the name
of the party you're lookin' for.

882
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:17,200
I already told you.
Call New York. Talk to the lawyer.

883
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:21,969
I did. That fancy mouthpiece, he gave me
the same big-city shit as you.

884
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,444
What do you want me to say?
Hey, you and Effie Klinker over there...

885
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:28,276
why don't you just fuck off
and leave me alone?

886
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:31,749
This ain't jigaboo town, ass wipe!
You play jump rope with Louisiana law...

887
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:35,812
and I'm gonna stuff your big-city smarts
right up your New York ass!

888
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:41,088
This Krusemark broad, she was into
stargazing, black magic, all kinds of shit.

889
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:46,394
There ain't nothin' worse for a cop than
people who get killed for nutso reasons.

890
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:51,869
Sorry if I made a mess. Maybe you
can get your nigger to clean it up.

891
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,915
Girl of my dreams

892
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:05,781
I love you

893
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:09,379
Honest I do

894
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:15,224
You are so sweet

895
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:23,902
If I could just hold your charms

896
01:32:24,005 --> 01:32:27,941
Again in my arms

897
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,476
Life...

898
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:32,978
What's that tune you're singin'?

899
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:36,414
You don't know it?
It's one by Johnny Favorite.

900
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:39,577
My mom used to sing it
to me all the time.

901
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:45,485
- You okay?
- Yeah.

902
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:51,361
If I could just

903
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:54,332
Hold your charms

904
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:58,933
Again in my arms

905
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:03,770
Life would be complete

906
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:43,672
Shit!

907
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:31,357
Thanks.

908
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,501
What do you want, Mr. Angel?

909
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:51,976
I guess you already knew that.

910
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:53,706
Why should I?

911
01:35:53,814 --> 01:35:56,146
A couple of your morons
with a matching poodle...

912
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,946
have been chasing
my balls around for days.

913
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:02,753
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.

914
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:06,816
As far as I know, that dance band
scumbag is dead.

915
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:11,125
That dance band scumbag may be
the one that killed your daughter.

916
01:36:11,232 --> 01:36:14,167
Who's employing you?

917
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:15,860
I can't say.

918
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:17,938
I'll pay.

919
01:36:18,038 --> 01:36:20,006
So do they.

920
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:23,076
Twelve years ago you and your daughter
snatched Favorite...

921
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:26,146
out of some nuthatch
up in Poughkeepsie.

922
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:31,241
You paid a junkie doctor 25 grand to
pretend Johnny was still a turniphead.

923
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:35,254
You did a pretty good job
until a week ago.

924
01:36:35,356 --> 01:36:38,154
You used the name Edward Kelly.

925
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:45,522
Let's walk over here. It's a little
private, and you can sample our gumbo.

926
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:48,033
That's all right.
I got a nasty stomach.

927
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,763
Besides, Cajun cooking kills me.

928
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:59,238
It's a pity about your stomach.
You'd have enjoyed our gumbo.

929
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:22,295
I was Edward Kelly. It was me
who paid Fowler the 25 G's.

930
01:37:23,537 --> 01:37:26,131
- Did Favorite know you?
- No.

931
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,707
He acted like a sleepwalker.

932
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:30,174
He just stared out the window
and watched the lights go by.

933
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:34,305
Where were you takin' him?

934
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:37,942
Times Square. It was New Year's Eve,
1943. I just dropped him off...

935
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:42,250
in the crowd and he walked out of
our lives forever, or so we thought.

936
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:46,588
You're tellin' me that you paid 25 grand
for a guy and you lost him in a crowd?

937
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:48,889
I did it for my daughter.

938
01:37:48,996 --> 01:37:51,760
It was some sort of hocus-pocus
she and Johnny were foolin' around with.

939
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:53,527
- My daughter was obsessed.
- I know.

940
01:37:53,634 --> 01:37:55,534
I found a mummified hand
in her room.

941
01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:59,732
The "hand of glory." It was supposed
to be able to open any lock.

942
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,331
It was the right hand of a
convicted murderer...

943
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:04,104
cut off while his neck
was still in the noose.

944
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:07,305
Or so Margaret believed.

945
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:10,611
- Black magic.
- Black, white, what difference does it make?

946
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,709
- Margaret was always...
- Evil.

947
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,981
Evil is a dunghill, Mr. Angel.

948
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:17,887
Everyone gets on his own and
speaks out about someone else's.

949
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:22,019
Margaret wasn't evil.
She was a strange kid, though.

950
01:38:22,129 --> 01:38:24,461
She was into tarot cards
before she could read.

951
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:26,863
Who got her started?

952
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:29,265
Some maid, governess...
who knows?

953
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:32,806
Some maid, some governess... Everything
you tell me is a crock of shit!

954
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:37,310
You're the one that got her started!
You're the fuckin' devil worshipper!

955
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:39,675
The prince of darkness
protects the powerful.

956
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:42,806
- That's a crock of shit!
- I can't help it if you don't believe.

957
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:47,445
You come straight with me, you slimebag,
or I'll save this state an execution.

958
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:50,921
I introduced Johnny Favorite
to my daughter. He was very powerful.

959
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:53,892
I once watched him conjure up
"Lucifuge" in my living room.

960
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:55,689
He was in it much deeper than me.

961
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:58,959
He made a pact with Satan.
He sold his soul.

962
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:00,795
You expect me to swallow that?

963
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:02,061
Swallow it. Spit it out.
I don't give a damn.

964
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:06,333
That's a crock of shit, you
lying, old, fucking motherfucker!

965
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,568
- He sold his soul for stardom.
- For stardom? Are you...

966
01:39:09,677 --> 01:39:13,340
- That's a crock of shit!
- Satan rose from the depth.

967
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:16,610
It was magnificent, except he thought
he could outwit the prince of darkness.

968
01:39:16,717 --> 01:39:20,278
Johnny sold his soul. Then when he
made it big, he tried to duck out of it.

969
01:39:20,387 --> 01:39:22,252
That's a crock of shit!

970
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:25,189
Johnny came across an obscure rite
in an ancient manuscript.

971
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:28,489
- He needed a victim his own age.
- Why?

972
01:39:28,595 --> 01:39:32,895
To steal their soul. So Toots and Johnny
picked up a young soldier.

973
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:33,796
Who?

974
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:36,836
Just a soldier celebrating New
Year's eve in Times Square.

975
01:39:36,937 --> 01:39:39,497
- Who was this soldier?
- They took him back to Johnny's hotel.

976
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:42,973
- That's where the ceremony took place.
- What ceremony?

977
01:39:43,077 --> 01:39:45,477
The boy was bound naked
on a rubber mat.

978
01:39:45,579 --> 01:39:48,707
There were complicated incantations
and stuff in Latin and Greek.

979
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:51,216
A pentacle was branded
on his chest.

980
01:39:51,318 --> 01:39:55,118
Margaret handed Johnny a virgin dagger
and he sliced the boy clean open.

981
01:39:55,222 --> 01:39:57,713
And he ate his heart.

982
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:01,022
He cut it out so quickly the heart was
still beating when he wolfed it down.

983
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:05,121
Johnny's plan was to drop out
and resurface as the soldier.

984
01:40:05,232 --> 01:40:07,962
But before he could work
things out, he was drafted.

985
01:40:08,068 --> 01:40:11,094
Then Johnny was injured, sent home
without even knowing who he was.

986
01:40:11,205 --> 01:40:13,799
Who was that boy?

987
01:40:13,907 --> 01:40:19,174
Only Johnny knew. He sealed the dog tags
in a vase and gave it to Margaret.

988
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:21,873
It was Margaret's plan
to drop him off in Times Square.

989
01:40:21,982 --> 01:40:25,884
That would be the last place that
he'd remember before it happened.

990
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:32,019
He needed a victim...
someone his own age...

991
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:38,423
to steal their soul.

992
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:43,094
And he sliced the boy
clean open and he ate his heart.

993
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:46,468
Who was the boy?

994
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:51,033
Johnny's plan was to drop out
and resurface as the soldier.

995
01:40:51,145 --> 01:40:53,272
Or maybe he gained possession
of the guy's soul.

996
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,870
He still looked like Johnny to me.

997
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:06,525
Oh, shit!

998
01:43:10,717 --> 01:43:12,617
No!

999
01:43:17,724 --> 01:43:20,955
I know who I am!
I know who I am!

1000
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:44,048
Alas.

1001
01:43:44,151 --> 01:43:48,747
How terrible is wisdom when it brings
no profit to the wise, Johnny.

1002
01:43:50,424 --> 01:43:52,551
Louis Cyphre.

1003
01:43:54,127 --> 01:43:57,255
Lucifer.

1004
01:43:57,364 --> 01:44:00,458
Even your name
is a dime-store joke.

1005
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:04,697
Mephistopheles is such
a mouthful in Manhattan, Johnny.

1006
01:44:04,805 --> 01:44:08,036
You think posing as the devil...

1007
01:44:08,141 --> 01:44:11,907
just 'cause it scared some
superstitious old guitar player...

1008
01:44:12,012 --> 01:44:15,709
and that witch
and that nutty old man...

1009
01:44:15,816 --> 01:44:17,943
You think it's gonna scare me?

1010
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:21,509
It ain't, 'cause I know who I am.

1011
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:25,558
And you killed them,
and you're tryin' to pin it on me.

1012
01:44:25,659 --> 01:44:28,787
And I know who I am.

1013
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:32,456
If I had cloven hoofs and a pointed
tail, would you be more convinced?

1014
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:36,562
You're crazy.

1015
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:39,969
I know who I am.
You're trying to frame me.

1016
01:44:40,073 --> 01:44:43,406
You're trying to frame me.
Cyphre, I know who I am.

1017
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:46,411
You murdered them people.
I never killed nobody.

1018
01:44:46,513 --> 01:44:49,778
I didn't kill Fowler...

1019
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:51,783
and...

1020
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:54,149
and I didn't kill Toots...

1021
01:44:54,254 --> 01:44:57,519
and I didn't kill Margaret
and I didn't kill Krusemark.

1022
01:44:57,624 --> 01:45:00,149
I didn't kill no one.

1023
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:03,593
- I'm afraid you did, Johnny.
- My name's not Johnny.

1024
01:45:03,697 --> 01:45:05,790
All killed by your own hand.

1025
01:45:05,899 --> 01:45:08,527
Guided by me, naturally.

1026
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:12,162
Frankly, you were doomed from the moment
you slit that young boy in half.

1027
01:45:12,272 --> 01:45:14,536
And Johnny...

1028
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:19,169
for 12 years you've been living on
borrowed time in another man's memories.

1029
01:45:22,749 --> 01:45:25,445
Hey, I'm gonna tell Winesap,
'cause he knows.

1030
01:45:25,552 --> 01:45:28,885
Winesap? Well, he's dead.

1031
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:30,047
Nasty accident.

1032
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:36,194
Don't worry. No one will mourn
one less lawyer in the world.

1033
01:45:36,296 --> 01:45:39,527
There's death everywhere
these days, Johnny.

1034
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:44,127
But what gives human life
its worth anyway?

1035
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:47,832
Because someone loves it or hates it?

1036
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:51,934
The flesh is weak, Johnny.
Only the soul is immortal.

1037
01:45:57,617 --> 01:46:00,211
And yours belongs to me.

1038
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:06,918
I know who I am.

1039
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:14,265
That's it, Johnny.
Take a good look.

1040
01:46:15,335 --> 01:46:17,530
However cleverly you
sneak up on a mirror...

1041
01:46:17,637 --> 01:46:20,538
your reflection always
looks you straight in the eye.

1042
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:23,006
I know who I am!

1043
01:46:32,519 --> 01:46:34,077
- Well...
- Girl of my dreams

1044
01:46:34,187 --> 01:46:36,849
I love you

1045
01:46:36,957 --> 01:46:41,394
Honest, I do

1046
01:46:41,495 --> 01:46:48,958
You are so sweet

1047
01:46:50,203 --> 01:46:53,468
If I could just
hold your charms

1048
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:58,237
- I know who I am!
- Again in my arms

1049
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:03,140
Then life would be

1050
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:07,414
Complete

1051
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:11,423
Since you've been gone, dear

1052
01:47:12,692 --> 01:47:15,923
Life don't seem the same

1053
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:20,461
Please come back

1054
01:47:20,567 --> 01:47:24,128
With me

1055
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:29,572
And after all's said and done

1056
01:47:29,676 --> 01:47:34,511
There's only one

1057
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:38,380
Girl of my dreams

1058
01:47:38,485 --> 01:47:41,750
That's you

1059
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:09,538
Why'd you come back?

1060
01:48:19,893 --> 01:48:21,793
I live here.

1061
01:48:23,597 --> 01:48:25,656
Who is she?

1062
01:48:27,701 --> 01:48:30,727
She ain't "Angel, Harold."

1063
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,738
She's my daughter.

1064
01:48:35,842 --> 01:48:38,538
Bullshit. Who is she?

1065
01:48:39,946 --> 01:48:43,382
She's Epiphany Proudfoot.

1066
01:48:43,483 --> 01:48:45,974
She stayed here for a little while.

1067
01:48:48,655 --> 01:48:50,850
Long enough for you
to kill her, right?

1068
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:53,084
Unless that ain't your gun
up her snatch.

1069
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:12,605
You're gonna burn for this, Angel.

1070
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:17,877
I know.

1071
01:49:19,686 --> 01:49:21,586
In hell.

Johnny.
