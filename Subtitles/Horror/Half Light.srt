1
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,330
TOY: Time for action!

2
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,370
Gangrene, you slimeball!

3
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,690
Hands up!

4
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,690
TOY: Gangrene, you slimeball!

5
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,170
- Hey, Thomas.
- Hi, Brian.

6
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,690
- How was school, eh?
- Fine.

7
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,930
good.

8
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,050
Time's up, you slimeball.

9
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,210
- Let's go outside.
- I'm almost done.

10
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,410
Come on, mom, you promised.

11
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,850
I know
and I am a terrible mother.

12
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,970
- You're horrible.
- Horrible?

13
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,010
- You're dreadful.
- Dreadful? Oh!

14
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,650
Well, I知 gonna be horrible
and I知 gonna be dreadful

15
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,730
if I don't finish
this chapter.

16
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,610
So I need at least...

17
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,450
- five minutes.
- Three.

18
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,410
Four.

19
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,410
Deal. We're escaping outside!
Whoosh!

20
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,570
- Hey.
- Hey.

21
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,890
What did they say?

22
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,730
Not interested.

23
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,810
What do they know?
They rejected my first novel anyway.

24
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,650
It's Tabitha king
syndrome.

25
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,770
Stephen King's wife.

26
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,330
She's a good enough writer,
but no one knows her.

27
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,130
All they know is Stephen King.

28
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,530
They'll know you
one day.

29
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,410
Look at all the help
you've given me.

30
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,690
That's editing, darling.
It's not the same thing.

31
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,050
See? "not sufficiently
mysterious for a mystery,

32
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,330
nor sufficiently thrilling
for a thriller."

33
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,130
You know, it wouldn't
be the worst thing

34
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,690
to add a few thrills
and resubmit it.

35
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,650
Throw in some more blood?

36
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,690
Psychopath jumping
out of the closet with an axe?

37
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,090
No, it's not
the English tradition.

38
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,490
I thought a sort of style, wit...

39
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,650
imagination.

40
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,050
Darling, you have wit?

41
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,130
Very good.

42
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,130
You're the best editor in London
is that so bad?

43
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,370
Max Perkins saved Hemingway.

44
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,410
Yes, well, no one
remembers max Perkins,

45
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,570
and he's right up there
with Tabitha what's-her-face.

46
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,730
Well, I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

47
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,810
Well, you do realize,
darling, that...

48
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,370
that I知 supposed to be
saying that to you?

49
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,410
Hey, when can I read some?

50
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,050
About three minutes.
That's all Thomas has given me.

51
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,410
Okay, three minutes it is.

52
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,370
TOY: Action alert!

53
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,690
Hand's up!

54
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,730
Action alert!

55
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,970
Hands up!

56
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,850
Brian, dinner's ready.

57
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,450
Yeah, coming.

58
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,850
Thomas.

59
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,570
Thomas?

60
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,890
Thomas?

61
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,810
Thomas?

62
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,930
Thomas?

63
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,970
Thomas! No!

64
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,450
Oh, baby.

65
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,730
Brian! Come on.

66
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,490
Come on! Breathe!

67
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,970
Brian!

68
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,250
no...

69
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,570
no no...

70
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,450
no!

71
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,690
WOMAN: I searched
every website.

72
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,570
This is everything you want.

73
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,410
It's remote, quiet,

74
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,730
- no one around for miles.
- Ingonish cove.

75
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,170
You'll get so much writing done
it's got the boats we used in Suffolk

76
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,690
do you know how long
you might want it for?

77
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,930
I don't know.

78
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,490
Just whatever it takes
for me to finish this book.

79
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,850
It looks great.

80
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,450
Well, Brian hasn't
been any help.

81
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,010
He should have been
there for you.

82
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,730
Yeah, weli...
he tried.

83
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,690
Look, whatever we had,
we lost a long time ago.

84
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,130
Yeah, I know.

85
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,690
But are you really gonna
be okay out there, all by yourself?

86
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,690
- It's only been eight months.
- Yeah, I知 fine.

87
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,570
Would you like to get some tea?

88
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,690
Yeah.

89
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,690
I'll get you wherever you are!

90
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,650
If you're really gonna go,
take these with you.

91
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:09,290
You know I was wanting to try
it without it for awhile, Robert.

92
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,690
It's just in case.

93
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,690
Rachel.

94
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,930
Shall I call Bartlett?

95
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,730
I'm not up for divorce
lawyers right now.

96
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,570
Let's just deal with all that
when I get back.

97
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,450
- ROBERT: So how did it go?
- BRIAN: All this time,

98
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,010
she's never talked
to me about Thomas.

99
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,370
She won't open up to me at all.

100
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,850
You've got to remember it's not
the same for you.

101
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,530
What, because he's not my son?

102
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,170
Because you weren't
the one who left the gate open.

103
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,610
- Hello.
- WOMAN: Rachel, how are you?

104
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,530
You should see where
I am right now.

105
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,930
- You're there already?
- It's beautiful,

106
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,050
and there's not another
house around for miles.

107
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,090
They said there
was a lighthouse
there as well?

108
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,010
- Mm-hmm.
- You've got one in your book
haven't you?

109
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,570
You can do some research.

110
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,570
RACHEL: It's perfect.
It's exactly what I wanted.

111
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,850
If I can't write here,
I can't write anywhere.

112
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,090
Ah. At least you're
not stuck writing crap

113
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,970
for a crap paper,
like I am.

114
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,690
It's not that bad.

115
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,010
It keeps the bills at bay.

116
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,410
- Almost
- yeah, which is good for you.

117
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,010
Which I don't
need reminding.

118
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,650
Hey, remember...

119
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,370
if you want me to come out there,
you just say the word.

120
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,250
Thanks.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna be okay.

121
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,650
I really... I really think
I知 gonna be okay.

122
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,530
Excuse me...

123
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,450
excuse me? Am I headed the
right way into town?

124
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,970
Sorry?

125
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,450
Am I...

126
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,890
am I headed the right
way into town?

127
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,690
Yeah, you just follow up the beach.
You can't miss it.

128
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,690
Okay, I wasn't sure.

129
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,010
Are you traveling through?

130
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,170
Oh, no no, actually, I致e just
moved into foster road, number 1.

131
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,650
Foster road, number 1?
Are you sure?

132
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,370
I think so.
It's the only house on the road.

133
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,330
Yeah, that's it.

134
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,250
I'm Finlay Murray,

135
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,810
what passes for a police
sergeant round here.

136
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,290
- And I知 Mary.
- Hello. Rachel Carlson.

137
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,650
- So you here
on your own?
- Yeah.

138
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,050
Well, if you hang on,
I値l give you a lift in.
It's a wee bit of a hike.

139
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,930
Thank you,
but this is what I知 here for.

140
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,850
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

141
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,490
- Okay.
- To the beach.

142
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,010
- Yep.
- All right. Thank you.

143
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,890
Your son's waiting for you.

144
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,250
On the swings.

145
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,730
He's been waiting for you.
He told me.

146
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,930
My son?

147
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,210
I'm sorry.

148
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,010
It must have been
someone else's little boy.

149
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,530
Wait. Can I talk to you?

150
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,370
I was mistaken,
that's all.

151
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,690
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

152
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:23,450
THOMAS: Mom? We're escaping outside
come with us.

153
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,650
You promised,
but you never came.

154
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,330
It's impressive,
don't you think?

155
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,010
Quite.

156
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,290
I didn't realize that there was
anyone else around.

157
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,690
Carry on.

158
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,290
Lighthouses are a dying breed.

159
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,530
I'm Angus McCulloch,
the lighthouse keeper.

160
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,370
Rachel.

161
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,930
Sorry, I just assumed

162
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,330
that all lighthouses
were automated now.

163
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,850
Well, most of them are.

164
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,530
In a few years,
I値l be gone, too.

165
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,610
So what brings
you out here?

166
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,650
I'm researching
lighthouses for a book.

167
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,970
It's a long way from America
just to see a lighthouse.

168
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,610
No no, I live in London
actually.

169
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,210
I'm just out here
doing some writing.

170
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,610
Oh, you're in
the cottage.

171
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,570
It's about time
someone moved in.

172
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,530
It's been empty for years.

173
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,170
Well, you've certainly
come to the right place

174
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,530
to write a book.

175
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,690
Did you meet the horses yet?

176
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,130
That's a story for you.

177
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,690
A Spanish galleon shipwrecked,

178
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,370
right there, 1754.

179
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,010
The entire crew died,

180
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,090
but a few horses
swam here to safety,

181
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,130
and they've been here
ever since.

182
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,130
And they've never
been off the island?

183
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,730
I can think of worse.

184
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:25,930
Yeah.

185
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,370
Listen, I知 just
putting some dinner on.
You're welcome to stay,

186
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,570
have something to eat.

187
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,690
I can tell you
everything you need
to know about lighthouses.

188
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,410
Thanks, I need to get back.

189
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,890
I'm still unpacking boxes.

190
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,330
Well, look, maybe next week.

191
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,210
Same time?

192
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,850
I'll cook some extra
and if you don't show,

193
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,330
I値l eat with the horses.

194
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,810
We should be friends.

195
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,690
We're neighbors now.

196
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,570
We should.

197
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,930
RACHEL: "to my love in
honor of what we decided yesterday."

198
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,290
"Forever yours, k."

199
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,650
"Page 145, line 7."

200
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,490
"Today I begin to understand
what love must be,

201
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,730
if it exists.

202
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,650
When we are parted,

203
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,050
we each feel the lack
of the other half of ourselves.

204
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,050
We are incomplete,

205
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,650
like a book
in two volumes

206
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,930
of which the first
has been lost.

207
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,170
This is what
I imagine love to be...

208
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,730
incompleteness in absence."

209
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,970
ACTION MAN:
I'll get you wherever you are!

210
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,490
Thomas.

211
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,010
Thomas.

212
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,410
Mama.

213
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,570
It's okay, mom.

214
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,850
Don't go.

215
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,690
- Don't run, don't go.
- I won't.

216
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,370
Come. Be with me.

217
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,650
Ah!

218
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,210
Hello.

219
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,850
You turned up at last.

220
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,170
Good timing
I知 just burning the fish.

221
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,730
It's good to see you.

222
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,650
How's your research coming?

223
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,650
Well, it's all right.
Could be better.

224
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,450
That's why I知 here.
I was hoping I could get a tour.

225
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,450
Okay.

226
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,730
How about some lunch
before the tour?

227
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,650
Is there anything
else on the menu?

228
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,170
Why is it that everyone
paints their boats

229
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,690
the exact same color
as their houses?

230
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,930
Well, that's actually
a tradition here.

231
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,690
The wife needs to be able
to look out on the water

232
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,770
and know her
husband's okay.

233
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,650
That's very romantic.

234
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,730
And we also
get a tax break
on the paint.

235
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,810
Which is also very romantic.

236
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,410
Very romantic.

237
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,770
RACHEL: I can't make it!

238
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,970
Quick.

239
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,850
Do you ever get lonely
working out here?

240
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,650
You never get lonely
sitting at your typewriter?

241
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,370
Sometimes.

242
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,250
I like being alone.

243
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,970
Do you really
like it?

244
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,690
Or do you think it's
just something you've
gotten used to?

245
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:08,610
Or maybe I like it
because I致e gotten used to it.

246
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,970
- I love it out here.
- Who do you talk to?

247
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,450
Who do
you
talk to?

248
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,690
Isn't that what you
love about writing?

249
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,650
The solitude?

250
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,010
I write because...

251
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,770
well, I don't function
very well as a human being

252
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,650
unless I知 writing

253
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,930
well, what are you writing now?

254
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,690
I'm not.

255
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,250
RACHEL: Don't tell me
you paint as well!

256
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,770
Oh, no.

257
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,930
Kate, my wife.

258
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,890
She...

259
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:06,370
we haven't seen each
other for a long time.

260
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,850
She loved it out here at first.

261
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,890
But in the end,
the isolation was too much for her.

262
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:19,490
Loneliness
can make you
a little crazy, I think.

263
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,370
Come on.

264
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,090
Wow!

265
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,770
Kate could never understand
why I wouldn't leave here.

266
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,090
But my father lived here

267
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,690
and his father before him.

268
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,610
My great-grandfather,

269
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,770
he built the balcony

270
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,810
from wood that was washed
ashore from a shipwreck.

271
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,690
This is him.

272
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,810
I could never leave here.

273
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,730
You'll see why.

274
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,890
Come on.

275
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:03,330
By the way,
I致e brought you something

276
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,730
as a thank you for the tour.

277
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,130
It's one of my books.

278
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,130
- I had it sent.
- Thanks.

279
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,930
"Dreamers awake,"
by Rachel Carlson.

280
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,650
I'm impressed.

281
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,730
Is it a comedy or a tragedy?

282
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,250
Well, it's a mystery.

283
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:26,210
But please be kind... it is
the first novel I had published.

284
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,930
Weli...

285
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:30,690
I値l find out
all about you.

286
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,970
Maybe.

287
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,770
If you need any help,
just send out a flare.

288
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,690
- I'll keep an eye out for you.
- Thank you. I really...

289
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,690
I really enjoyed that today.

290
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,330
Aye. Me too.

291
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,610
SHARON: So have you
slept with him yet?

292
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,530
RACHEL: It's just nice to have
someone to talk to.

293
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,610
Meaning you haven't
slept with him.

294
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,650
You know,
you're starting to sound

295
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,690
like you're conducting
a tabloid interview, my friend.

296
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,330
You know me, always working,

297
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,930
always looking for the angle.

298
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,690
And you know I rely
on you for my kicks.

299
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,650
Is that the sea I can hear?

300
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,610
Yes, it's less
than 10 feet away.

301
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,690
- Can you hear the crashing?
- Wow, look at you.

302
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,330
Number one best sellers,

303
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,250
waves at your feet,
romance on a deserted island.

304
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,690
Tough life.

305
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,370
Rachel, I知 sorry.
That came out wrong.

306
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,610
Sharon, forget it.
It's okay.

307
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,370
Look, I wouldn't have made it
this far without you.

308
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:14,410
I mean it.
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

309
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,690
Okay.

310
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,690
Okay, don't peek.

311
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,850
Qu... qu... qu-quick quick quick.

312
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,690
Ready?

313
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,410
- RACHEL: Smile.
- Okay.

314
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,690
RACHEL: And no faces this time.

315
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,410
Hurry hurry,
come on, come on.

316
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,930
Wait wait wait.
It's gonna come.

317
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,370
- You smiling?
You promise? - Yes.

318
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,570
- Yes.
- You promise?

319
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,570
ANGUS: Rachei...

320
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,850
are you okay?

321
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,690
Rachel?

322
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,090
Is something wrong?

323
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,170
What's wrong?

324
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,250
I think I need to get back.

325
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,410
Why?

326
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,490
I'm sorry.

327
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,330
- Afternoon, Rachel.
- Afternoon.

328
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,530
Are we gonna see you
here on Sunday?

329
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:58,250
I don't think so.
Your man and I aren't
on very good terms.

330
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,970
Don't you worry about
that.
All the more
reason to come.

331
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,770
Your cross is broken.

332
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,970
I know.

333
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,210
It's this
weekend's chore.

334
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,970
It's the gate, isn't it?

335
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,130
What?

336
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,130
Why you're so sad.

337
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,410
You left the gate open.

338
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,770
You haven't been able
to go out there since
he died, have you?

339
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,490
RACHEL: All right, ready?

340
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,130
All right, here we go.

341
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,690
Now face this way.
Okay, good.

342
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,410
Okay, let's smile.

343
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,330
Smile.

344
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,210
MORAG: He's beside you,
your son.

345
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,650
He's dripping wet.

346
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,450
He follows you everywhere.

347
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,210
He's trying to hold your hand.

348
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,930
What's she been saying?

349
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,650
More of her psychic
mumbo-jumbo?

350
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,690
Listen, don't worry,
she'll say anything to get
somebody to talk to her.

351
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:48,330
Watch your fingers. Jim,
get us that dustpan and brush.

352
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,130
MORAG: Yes yes, I can hear her.
I'm not answering.

353
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,690
- RACHEL: Is anybody here?
- I should have never
have gone to see her.

354
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,690
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

355
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,810
I'm not listening.

356
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,130
You can keep talking,
but I知 not listening.

357
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,290
I'm not getting out
of this chair

358
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,090
for the love of god or money.

359
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,930
I can't save her.

360
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,330
I can't save anyone.

361
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:31,690
Things are gonna get worse.

362
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,490
Rachel. Come in.

363
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,450
Do you think it's possible?

364
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,690
Do you think I could be
getting messages from him?

365
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,690
I don't know.

366
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,250
Maybe.

367
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,730
Maybe the dead miss us

368
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,810
even more than we miss them.

369
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,850
I've replayed it so many times.

370
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:38,370
If I壇 only gone out to play
with him like I said I would,

371
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,410
that this never would
have happened.

372
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,650
And I keep thinking of him

373
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:50,370
in the water, struggling,
and I wasn't there.

374
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,330
I'm the mother.

375
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,210
I'm supposed to be there to
protect him, and I wasn't.

376
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,690
I came here thinking
that I could write,

377
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,690
and that everything
would be okay.

378
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,970
And you know what?
It's not okay.

379
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,210
It's not okay,
and I知 not okay.

380
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,890
Rachel, shh.

381
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,570
Shh shh shh.

382
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,330
What is this?

383
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,290
It's an old Celtic ballad.

384
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,490
"Caileag an stoirm."

385
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,690
"Girl in the storm."

386
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,250
It's beautiful.

387
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,370
I finished your book.

388
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,690
Did you learn all about me?

389
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,690
Maybe.

390
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,770
Here.

391
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:09,330
I made something for you.

392
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,850
To inspire you.

393
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:26,850
I'll leave a key out for you...

394
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:32,290
so you can come up
whenever you want to,

395
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,170
in case I知 out
fishing or something.

396
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,930
Look,
it's mother-of-pearl.

397
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,370
I love these.

398
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,050
Do you know the old
Celtic legend about them?

399
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,810
- About those?
- Yeah.

400
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,650
No.

401
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,890
Come on.

402
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:13,690
First,
we have to bury it together.

403
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,090
- Together.
- Right.

404
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:22,450
And then if one
of us ever returns

405
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,290
and digs it up, then...

406
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:28,410
then we were meant
for each other?

407
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:33,130
Well, actually,
I don't know because
I just made it up.

408
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,450
Very Celtic of you.

409
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:38,930
You know, I was thinking
that exact same thing.

410
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,930
Do you know Mary,
Finlay's wife?

411
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,690
She's having a little
birthday thing

412
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:48,850
in the village tomorrow,

413
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,610
and I was thinking
that maybe you'd like to go.

414
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,610
I'd love to go.

415
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:04,610
So like, 2:00?

416
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,690
2:00

417
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:17,690
hey, Rachel.

418
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,850
I'll see you tomorrow.

419
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,610
2:00, right?

420
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,690
RACHEL: "she lay there

421
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,690
in the half light of the cabin

422
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:31,650
unable to sleep.

423
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,770
In the morning,
she told him she had,

424
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,650
for there were still
some limits

425
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,610
to the things she could
say to him then.

426
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,290
But most of the night,
she watched his eyelids

427
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,970
and his lips and his face.

428
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:49,050
And in the stillness,

429
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,250
she felt peace."

430
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,490
- Hey, Rachel, how you doing?
- Hello.

431
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,490
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I知 all right.

432
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,610
Rachel, you made it!

433
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,490
Oh, great.

434
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,250
- There you go, honey.
- I've got something for you.
Happy birthday.

435
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:52,530
That's so sweet of you.
Thanks very much.

436
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,330
Would you like a drink?

437
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:58,490
- A lager.
- It's on the way.

438
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:40,530
Rachel, your glass is empty.

439
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:44,010
Happy birthday to you

440
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:47,690
happy birthday to you

441
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:51,410
happy birthday, dear Mary

442
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:54,450
happy birthday to you.

443
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,530
Happy birthday.

444
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,690
Excuse me, Mary,
I知 sorry to interrupt.

445
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,850
I'm meeting a friend here
Angus McCulloch.

446
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:33,450
- I thought you might
have seen him.
- What are you talking about?

447
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,410
Well, he was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

448
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,650
The lighthouse keeper.

449
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,810
Aye, I know who he is.

450
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,650
What does he look like,
your Angus?

451
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,490
Um...

452
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,770
dark hair, nice blue eyes.

453
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:52,010
Aye, that sounds like Angus.

454
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,650
I've not seen him
these seven years,

455
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,250
and neither have you,
'cause he's dead.

456
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:00,450
No, there must be some mistake.

457
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,330
Oh, he's dead all right,
him and the wife.

458
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,050
I chose the dress
we buried her in.

459
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:10,730
No, you're kidding,
right?

460
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:19,130
Reverend, you've been
out to the lighthouse,
haven't you?

461
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,330
No, not for years.

462
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:24,770
- Nobody goes out there anymore.
- But you know Angus McCulloch.

463
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,050
I used to, aye, but...

464
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:31,530
he's been dead for six...
no, seven years.

465
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,730
Is this a joke?

466
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,490
Rachel, this isn't funny.

467
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,530
People here don't
laugh about this.

468
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,090
What is this?

469
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:05,450
Why... why are you doing this?

470
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,930
Angus?

471
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:06,450
Loneliness can make you
a little crazy, I think.

472
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,450
ANGUS:
Kate could never understand

473
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:28,410
why I wouldn't leave here.

474
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,490
But my father lived here,

475
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:34,530
and his father before him.

476
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,210
I could never leave here.

477
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:54,570
Maybe the dead miss us
even more than we miss them.

478
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:09,250
FINLAY: Rachel.

479
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,810
What are you doing here?

480
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:15,130
You're gonna stir up trouble.

481
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,690
I came to look for Angus.

482
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:20,250
Angus McCulloch is dead

483
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,370
and buried.

484
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,970
I saw him jump off
that cliff over there.

485
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:29,250
I was with him, right here,
last night.

486
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:31,530
You couldn't have been.

487
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,970
Seven years ago

488
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,090
I came out to visit Angus,

489
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:41,450
just as I had done
dozens of times before.

490
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,530
There was a tape playing...
"caileag an stoirm"...

491
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,890
Angus's favorite song.

492
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:53,250
I found Kate inside.

493
00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:00,050
Angus came home early
from the village,

494
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:03,610
caught her in bed
with a local fisherman...

495
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,530
Gordon McCloud.

496
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,490
It had been going on
for months.

497
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:13,690
Angus was the only
one that didn't know
anything about it.

498
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,130
I caught a glimpse of him,

499
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,890
through the window.

500
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,370
I followed him up to the balcony,

501
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,930
but I was too late.

502
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,810
I felt for him.

503
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:29,250
We all did.

504
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:31,410
He just worshipped Kate.

505
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,170
When he caught her with Gordon,

506
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,930
he must have just snapped.

507
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,650
I heard all this from Kate.

508
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,610
She lived long enough
to tell me that Angus
didn't kill her.

509
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:46,530
She came between them
in the struggle.

510
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,170
Just before she died,

511
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:52,650
she prayed that Angus
would forgive her.

512
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,010
We all knew what was going on.

513
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,810
Nobody said anything.

514
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:04,530
Those three deaths are
as much on our hands
as they are on his.

515
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:10,010
It just can't be the same man.

516
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,490
I...

517
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:18,890
I can prove he was here.

518
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,490
If I can just get
this film developed.

519
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:30,730
There's a photo
of us together, and...

520
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:38,250
well, I... I must
have just misplaced
the film somewhere.

521
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,930
You couldn't have met
anyone out there.

522
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:44,530
He also did
a carving
for me that...

523
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,690
- Rachel.
...was right here.

524
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:49,370
Rachel, nobody goes
out there anymore.

525
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:51,810
The lighthouse was automated
after the murders

526
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,210
so we wouldn't have to.

527
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,970
And nobody's lived
in this house since then, either.

528
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:58,890
What do you mean,
this house?

529
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:02,530
Well, this was
Gordon McCloud's house.

530
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:07,530
He and Kate used to signal
each other with lights

531
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:09,890
when Angus was away.

532
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:22,010
This who you mean?

533
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:39,210
This just doesn't make any sense.

534
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,890
I've been with him practically
every day this last month.

535
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:47,730
We've eaten together,
we've walked on the beach,
we've been with the horses.

536
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:49,650
It's not like
I致e been out there

537
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,490
talking to myself all this time.

538
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:55,530
Well, if you've been flirting
with Angus McCulloch,

539
00:59:55,570 --> 01:00:00,530
who's that buried
in Ingonish cemetery?

540
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,090
You didn't believe us, eh?

541
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:09,250
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

542
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:14,250
You still haven't
fixed the cross.

543
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:18,770
No. No, I haven't.

544
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,530
It's this weekend's chore.

545
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,890
Excuse me.

546
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,530
You have some newspapers
missing on the microfilm.

547
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:06,890
It's a miracle we have
any there at all.

548
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,050
What you looking for?

549
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:12,330
Anything around
February 12th or 13th, 1998.

550
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:13,770
The McCulloch murder.

551
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:16,170
Kids probably pinched them.

552
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,530
Gory murders... kids love 'em.

553
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,530
What about internet access?

554
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:32,530
The computer's being fixed.

555
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,010
Sorry.

556
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,810
Look. I just need anything

557
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:45,050
that has a photo
of Angus McCulloch.

558
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,330
Try Ullapool public library.

559
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,850
MAN: You have reached
Ullapool public library.

560
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:04,530
We are closed at this time and
will reopen on Monday at 9:00.

561
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,530
- He wasn't there?
- No.

562
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,610
I don't understand.
His stuff, his boat...

563
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,250
- something must have been there.
- No no, nothing was there.

564
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,210
It was like he never existed.

565
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,650
There must be some explanation.

566
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,090
Yeah.
Heck, I知 losing it,

567
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,530
that's the explanation.

568
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:35,890
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

569
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:37,930
Have you spoken to Robert?

570
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,890
No. Maybe he was right

571
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:42,490
and I shouldn't have
gone off the medication.

572
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:44,490
Rachel, just come home.

573
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,490
Just get out of there
and come back.

574
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:51,530
You know what?
Maybe I did imagine Angus.

575
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:55,450
He seemed so perfect.

576
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:57,970
And there isn't
anything that perfect.

577
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:00,490
- Is there?
- Listen, I知 coming to you.

578
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:01,930
I'll get on the next plane

579
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:04,250
and I値l be there in a few hours.

580
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,490
You just sit tight.

581
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:08,690
You stay there, okay?

582
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,410
Okay.

583
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:13,530
I'll see you soon.

584
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:13,250
Rachel!
What are you doing here?

585
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:16,290
I knew you'd be here!

586
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:23,210
Rachel!
Come down
and meet me inside.

587
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,050
Sharon, he's here... Angus.

588
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:31,730
- What?
- He was on the balcony.

589
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:34,130
I saw him, then I saw you,
and then he was gone.

590
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:36,850
You didn't see him.
You didn't see anything.

591
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:39,530
- Your mind is playing
tricks on you. - No no.

592
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,530
- No.
- Come on, let's go home.

593
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:47,330
Sharon, he's right there,
in the doorway.

594
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:49,770
- There's no one there.
- Turn around.

595
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,370
I am not gonna turn around.

596
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:53,050
I'm not buying into this fantasy.

597
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,250
There's nobody there.

598
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:57,450
Listen to me.

599
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,650
I want you to do something for me.

600
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,970
Close your eyes.
Do this.

601
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:04,530
Close your eyes
and when you open them again,

602
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:07,490
he'll be gone.
You have to do this.

603
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:12,130
You make him go away
now,
and he'll never come back again.

604
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:18,010
Close your eyes.

605
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:21,290
And now he'll be gone.

606
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:29,090
He's coming towards us.

607
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:35,490
He's right behind you.

608
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:39,250
See?

609
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:43,090
Nothing.

610
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:47,130
Can we go now?

611
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:12,530
WOMAN: Legs, 11.
We have legs, 11.

612
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:16,170
Now what about 1 and 6?
It's sweet 16.

613
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:19,730
We'll not see that again,
will we?

614
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:23,690
And the next number is 88...
two fat ladies.

615
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:25,970
Bingo, bingo!

616
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:28,210
Where's Finlay?

617
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:32,090
Is he in here?

618
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:38,690
Would you come with me? I want
you to come with me right now.

619
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:41,810
What are you talking about?
I can't come with you.

620
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:44,090
Rachel, what are you doing?

621
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,650
He stabbed her right here.

622
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:09,530
So there'd be blood everywhere.

623
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:12,170
She was right here.

624
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:15,530
Well, she's not here now.

625
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:18,930
Come on, let's go.

626
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:22,730
She was here.

627
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:28,090
We need to do something.
Get more police here.

628
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,490
I'm not taking
anyone else out there.

629
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:32,610
I'm telling you,
someone must have moved the body.

630
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:33,970
Rachel, Rachel.

631
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,370
I want you to listen to me.

632
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:38,730
Angus McCulloch is dead.

633
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:41,850
And I値l bet your friend
is at home right now

634
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:45,970
reading the newspaper
and eating scones.

635
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:06,210
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message after the beep.

636
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,210
She's not there.

637
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:13,330
Yes, but that doesn't
mean she came up here.

638
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:16,450
Wherever she is, I知 sure
she's absolutely fine.

639
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,010
I want you to spend tonight

640
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,490
with Mary and me.

641
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:26,450
I don't think
you should be alone.

642
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,450
What do you think,
I知 making this up?

643
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:34,290
Nobody's out to get you.

644
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,770
Listen,
if this was one of your books,

645
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:39,290
which would you believe?

646
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,610
That the heroine fell in love

647
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:45,650
with a ghost who
then murdered her best friend,

648
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:47,530
or...

649
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:51,090
that she imagined it

650
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:53,330
and she needs some help?

651
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:59,330
I'm not crazy.

652
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,290
Weli...

653
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:04,890
the offer's there.

654
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:08,450
I'm at the other end of the phone.

655
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:14,450
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message after the beep.

656
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,850
Hi, it's me.

657
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:19,170
I don't know where you are.

658
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,490
I don't know if you came out here.

659
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:23,090
I don't know what's going on,

660
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:28,170
but if you could call me
when you get this...

661
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,010
okay?

662
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:35,290
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message after...

663
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:38,770
hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message a...

664
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,650
leave a message
after the beep.

665
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:43,730
Leave a mes...

666
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:53,730
Dr. Freedman, table for four.

667
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:54,570
This way, sir.

668
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:57,210
- Hello.
- RACHEL: Robert, it's me.

669
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,450
Rachel, listen,
I知 just in a restaurant,

670
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:01,490
- can I call you back?
- No no no.

671
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:05,010
Listen, I don't know
how to explain this,

672
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:08,530
but I think that Sharon
came out here

673
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:11,050
and that she may have been hurt.

674
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:13,490
What?
What are you talking about?

675
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:15,770
I need you to do me a favor,
okay?

676
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:18,050
Rachel, slow down.
What's happening?

677
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:22,010
I don't know what's happening.
That's just it.

678
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:26,210
Can you please just
go to Sharon's?

679
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:29,050
She's not answering
her phone or her cell.

680
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:30,450
What for?

681
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,530
I just need you
to go there, okay?

682
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:34,330
And then call me, okay?

683
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:35,730
Well, why shouldn't she be there?

684
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:39,330
Look, I just need you to
go there and then call me.

685
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,730
Listen, Rachel,
can't this wait?

686
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:43,130
- I've got friends here.
We're about to... - no.

687
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:46,370
Please, can you just
do this for me? Okay?

688
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:49,570
Okay. I'll go there,
and I値l call you.

689
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:52,490
Okay, I知 gonna
be waiting.

690
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,530
Okay.

691
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:02,370
All right, sorry about that.
Thanks very much.

692
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:04,490
Thank you. Okay.

693
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:53,210
I need to talk to you.

694
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:55,330
Come in.

695
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:59,530
The Scots call it
"da-shealladh."

696
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:01,530
"Second sight."

697
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,490
It's been my ruin.

698
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:07,490
You think the living
are full of regrets?

699
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:10,770
You ought to hear the dead
endlessly lamenting.

700
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:14,610
"Never made up with my children."

701
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:16,930
"Ignored my parents."

702
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:19,050
"Never told anyone I love them."

703
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:22,930
This isn't some kind
of game, is it?

704
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:26,770
I mean, you just
wouldn't make this up.

705
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:29,490
My son drowned.

706
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:33,050
I just want to
know that you...

707
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,890
that this isn't something
you would take lightly.

708
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:39,530
He follows you everywhere.

709
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:42,170
He's trying to warn you.

710
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:45,610
About what? What?

711
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:47,250
Angus?

712
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,490
What are you saying?

713
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:51,530
- Are you saying he's not dead?
- Oh, he's dead.

714
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:54,530
His ghost's out there
wandering the island.

715
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:56,690
Suicides are
forever trapped

716
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:58,770
between our world and the next.

717
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:02,370
When I cross, I don't want
anything on my conscience.

718
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:05,210
Don't go back to the island.

719
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,130
Leave Ingonish cove tonight.
Your life's in danger.

720
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:10,890
That's what Thomas has
come back to tell you.

721
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:14,650
I have to go back to
get Thomas's things.

722
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:16,650
Well, do it quickly.

723
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:28,770
Would you like some of mine?

724
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:31,490
Yeah, one second. Hello.

725
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:35,490
- Have you gone to Sharon's?
- I called her.
She's not answering.

726
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:39,530
What's this
all about?

727
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:44,890
- Would you excuse me a second?
- Yeah, sure.

728
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,450
Can I try a bit?

729
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:47,970
Are you awake?

730
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:50,330
Robert.
What a surprise.

731
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:53,170
I'm sorry to call you so late.
Do you have a second?

732
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:55,970
Yes, I知 just doing a little
late-night editing.

733
01:16:56,010 --> 01:17:00,490
- What's going on?
- Something strange is
going on with Rachel.

734
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:01,530
She's called me twice.

735
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,570
She's going on about Sharon
being hurt somehow.

736
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,130
She's not
making sense.

737
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:08,970
I knew she shouldn't have
gone out there by herself.

738
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:11,770
You don't think she's gonna
do anything stupid, do you?

739
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:14,690
The way she sounded,
nothing would surprise me.

740
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,210
Christ.

741
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,450
I-I was worried about this.

742
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:21,970
Well, listen,
I知 gonna call her now.

743
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:25,130
I think you should,
and get Sharon to also.

744
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:27,210
Yes, of course, of course.

745
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,250
Well, thanks for calling.

746
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:33,530
Okay, tell me how it goes.
I hope everything's okay.

747
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,730
Yes, I will.

748
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:38,010
Back from the dead?

749
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:45,810
You look good for a corpse.

750
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,490
Where's the rest
of it?

751
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:03,650
- You get it when we get it.
- Well, my price just doubled.

752
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,130
Four million,

753
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:09,810
slightly more than you told me.

754
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:14,330
Do you know what the funny
thing about you and Brian is?

755
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:17,810
You always talk about him.

756
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:21,650
All the ways the two
of you are going to...

757
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,570
enjoy the money.

758
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:25,490
But Brian,

759
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:27,530
he never talks about the money,

760
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:29,450
and he never talks about you.

761
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:31,290
He always talks about her.

762
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:35,610
Her books, her success,
her imagination.

763
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:39,210
It's envy of her... isn't it?

764
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:42,770
That brought you two together?

765
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:51,090
You both just want to be her.

766
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:55,210
The ghost has a heart, huh?

767
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,170
Is that why you were
on the balcony?

768
01:19:57,210 --> 01:20:00,210
You were meant to be downstairs.

769
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:03,370
Tonight?
I wasn't on the balcony.

770
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:06,530
I was downstairs the whole time.

771
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:08,450
And besides,

772
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:10,810
you're the ones who
have been improvising.

773
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:14,530
What's with all the messages
from her dead kid?

774
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,490
We never did that.

775
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:19,450
Good idea, though.
But we never did it.

776
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,890
How do you get your
hands on the money?

777
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:27,530
I thought you were
the guy who never asked.

778
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:30,050
"I do the job. They pay me.

779
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:31,490
I go home."

780
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:35,610
You did the job, so go home.

781
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:39,970
You didn't fall for her,
did you, Patrick,

782
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:44,770
while you were pretending to
fall for her?

783
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:49,530
Your whole life may
have just collapsed.

784
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:57,250
Do you remember

785
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:59,930
what I was doing

786
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:02,610
when we first met?

787
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:07,690
Yeah.

788
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:10,090
I thought you might.

789
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:15,210
I want the rest of the money.

790
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:19,890
I won't tell you again.

791
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:30,130
Sharon.

792
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:36,890
It was a pleasure killing you.

793
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:47,010
MAN: All aboard!

794
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:50,010
Sir!

795
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:53,530
All aboard!

796
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:27,610
RACHEL: I love these.

797
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:34,930
Do you know the old
Celtic legend about them?

798
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:41,130
First, we have
to bury it together.

799
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,490
Together.

800
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:04,530
And then if one
of us ever returns

801
01:27:04,570 --> 01:27:07,490
and digs it up, then...

802
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:10,930
ANGUS: Then we
were meant for each other?

803
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:15,330
Well, actually, I don't know
because I just made it up.

804
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:13,730
Rachel.

805
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:28,450
Just room for one more inside.

806
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:31,530
MARY: So there was nothing at all
out there on the island?

807
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:34,410
FINLAY: No,
poor girl must be crazy.

808
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:37,250
She's got "ghosts
in the attic."

809
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:41,010
Hey, I love this bit.
It's great.

810
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:44,410
This is where Hugo
the dummy comes alive.

811
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:50,530
It's nearly midnight.

812
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:58,930
- Finlay, I need your help
out on the island.
- For god's sake.

813
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:01,570
Rachel's in danger.
It might be too late already.

814
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:04,210
It's very late tonight.
You come back in the morning.

815
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,490
Finlay, please,
I need your help...

816
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:10,530
Finlay. The last time she tried
to warn us about something,

817
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:12,490
we all ignored her.

818
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:16,650
And we had three funerals
the next Sunday.

819
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:46,170
- SHARON: Brian, wait.
- Look, relax.

820
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:49,250
Everything's gone perfectly.

821
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:52,250
Everyone thinks she's crazy...

822
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:56,490
the whole village,
even her own shrink.

823
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:58,890
She's in love with a ghost.

824
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:01,770
She sees murders
that don't happen.

825
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:05,570
No one...

826
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:08,890
no one's gonna blink an
eye when she kills herself.

827
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:17,530
Then her grieving
husband inherits 4 million.

828
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:22,170
And you thought

829
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,850
I had no imagination.

830
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:38,490
BRIAN: Just in case
she loses courage,

831
01:31:38,530 --> 01:31:42,530
just in case she wants to save
herself at the last moment...

832
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:48,530
she throws the key
out of reach.

833
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:59,570
- Throws the anchor overboard.
- Wait!

834
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:03,650
- What?
- There's someone out there.

835
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:12,850
BRIAN: Did you see Patrick
get on the train?

836
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:14,730
SHARON: No.

837
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:17,530
It's gotta be him.

838
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:21,250
What's he doing?

839
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:23,970
I don't know.

840
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:27,290
We've gone too far
to stop now.

841
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,970
Brian, she's awake.

842
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:17,250
Don't look.

843
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:21,010
It's over.

844
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:24,490
We've gotta see about Patrick.

845
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:12,530
THOMAS: Don't forget
look behind you.

846
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:43,490
He's not here.

847
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:46,410
This place gives me the creeps.

848
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:48,410
What if Patrick was
telling the truth?

849
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:50,930
What if he wasn't
on the balcony?

850
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:55,530
Remember all those sailors
who said they saw Angus's
ghost on the island.

851
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:58,930
Yeah, drunk Scot sailors...

852
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:01,490
very reliable.

853
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:04,970
He's not here.
Let's go.

854
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:10,410
Start tying yourself up!

855
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:38,330
This isn't one of
your stories, Rachel.

856
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:44,090
There's not gonna be
a happy ending.

857
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:06,970
Patrick.

858
01:36:08,410 --> 01:36:12,850
No, not Patrick.

859
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:25,770
No!

860
01:38:58,570 --> 01:39:02,610
It's better this way,
you know?

861
01:39:02,650 --> 01:39:04,570
Thank you.

862
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:08,250
We'll keep people
off the island.

863
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:11,890
Maybe then Angus
can rest in peace.

864
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:14,010
You ready?

865
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:28,650
Do you know what
Thomas would've wanted?

866
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:31,810
Let go of his death.

867
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:34,050
Remember his life.
