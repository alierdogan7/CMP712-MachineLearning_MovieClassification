You son of a bitch!

Wait.

Go back to car, Duddie.

Look out, Jonesy.

I knew you'd come, Henry.

I knew you wouldn't let me die.

-Don't you know me, H?
-I don't know.

I don't know myself if Mr. Gray is gone.

1178
01:57:15,370 --> 01:57:18,203
He could be hiding in here somewhere...

1179

Tell me something Mr. Gray
couldn't possibly know.
