1
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,803
October 11, 1931, Los Angeles.

2
00:09:55,137 --> 00:10:00,517
A conflagration of biblical proportions
incinerates nearly everyone...

3
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:04,813
...in what was once LA's
most celebrated medical facility:

4
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,567
The Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute
For the Criminally Insane.

5
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,446
But the secret this inferno burned free
was far more frightening...

6
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,365
...than any picture
Hollywood could produce.

7
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,826
A sanitarium of slaughter...

8
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,954
...supervised by a surgeon gone mad:

9
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,666
Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

10
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,003
Doctor Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

11
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,796
Little known today...

12
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,884
...but likely the most prolific
mass murderer of this century.

13
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,844
He out-butchered Bundy.

14
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,846
He made Manson look meek.

15
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,891
And the site of his carnage
still exists today...

16
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,852
...restored almost to its original state.

17
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,648
But it has yet to be inhabited,
because some say...

18
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,900
...the spirits of Vannacutt and his victims...

19
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,154
...still live within the walls
of the House on Haunted Hill.

20
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,783
No shit.

21
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,495
We'll be back with more
Terrifying But True in a moment.

22
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,831
No need, baby.

23
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,334
You just gave me everything l needed.

24
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,768
Price.

25
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,062
Evelyn, how nice.

26
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:32,276
That is totally fucking fascinating,
but l've got to get back to you.

27
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,862
They're trying to shoot me here.

28
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,991
What is it, Mr. Price, business or pleasure?

29
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,492
Neither. My wife.

30
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:45,122
Your roller coaster is quote,
''Unlike any that has come before it.''

31
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,000
Absolutely. No cheap thrills.

32
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,252
A journey to the brink of madness.

33
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,590
lt just looks like a generic roller coaster
to me. What's the gimmick?

34
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,926
Ever seen one that starts at the top?

35
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,933
Twenty stories worth of top?

36
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,902
Sources said the reason
your park's opening has been delayed...

37
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,238
...was a near-fatal accident
on one of the rides here.

38
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:22,034
l wouldn't open this place tomorrow
if every single thing...

39
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:26,079
...down to the beheaded Beanie Babies,
hadn't tested 100-percent safe.

40
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,500
What the hell was that?

41
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,835
Growing pains.

42
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,797
New steel must bend and stretch a little
before finally settling in.

43
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:42,304
Don't worry. ln 15 years,
Price Amusements hasn't lost a customer.

44
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:46,058
l've designed and built six of these places.
Take my word for it...

45
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,726
...everything's fine.

46
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,033
God forbid, if something unexpected
should happen...

47
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,452
...there's always the safety cable.

48
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,704
That does what?

49
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,498
Keeps the cab from just--

50
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,381
Do something!

51
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,465
Like what?

52
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,467
This shouldn't be happening!

53
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,638
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

54
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,015
We're all going to die!

55
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,858
Ifyou survived Terror Incognita...

56
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,068
...please exit the elevator now.

57
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,873
From here on, it gets really scary!

58
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,419
All right, princess.
Now, what were you babbling?

59
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:49,014
Congratulations. On a scale of 1 to 10
on the perversity meter, you just hit a 73.

60
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:02,986
Why don't we go and celebrate
at some nice, quiet little restaurant?

61
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,407
Houston, l think we've got a problem.

62
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,286
Go stir your cauldron
or something for a sec.

63
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,417
Oh, shit!

64
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,629
We're going to fall!

65
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:21,922
Oh, my God!

66
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,592
Oh, my God!

67
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,886
Problem where? Looked good to me.

68
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,389
Passenger six, he keeps losing his arm.

69
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:34,309
Disengage the flailing-limb mechanism.
Make him into a screamer.

70
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,274
Here, dear, with a suggestion: Forget it.

71
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,738
Haunted Hill is exactly where
we're having my party this year.

72
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:50,659
Now, you'll find the guest list
on your desk when you get back.

73
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:56,832
l got your guest list right here, princess.
Shredded.

74
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,850
l'm going to pull out all the stops.

75
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:19,188
Excuse me, the people
from HRS Entertainment are getting antsy.

76
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,148
Tell them l'm right there.

77
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,285
Okay! Hi! Stop the car! Get out, please!

78
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,537
Stop the car and get out.

79
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,998
Can you stop your car? Stop your car!

80
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:06,253
And get out of the car! Please,
sir or ma'am, whoever's in the car, get out!

81
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,173
Hi! Hello.

82
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:13,427
We must walk the rest of the way
because the driveway's out. Let's go.

83
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:14,928
Quickly.

84
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,555
Even quicker.

85
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,849
Did l say quicker? l think l did.

86
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,727
l'm sorry. Hi, l'm Watson Pritchett.
l own the house.

87
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,645
So let's move, if we could.

88
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,981
So is this dump really haunted?

89
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,027
lt's pretty scary.

90
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,321
Let's have a good time.

91
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,239
Hold up. l got one question.

92
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:38,160
Why is this Price dude inviting us
to a birthday party?

93
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:39,745
l never even heard of him.

94
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:44,500
Neither had l until he rented the place.
But now l must get you inside, okay?

95
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,835
This $1 million each, though....

96
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,004
That's for real?

97
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,882
Good question. Don't have a clue.

98
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,217
Ask Price.

99
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,303
ls there a reason why
we're not moving forward at all?

100
00:18:56,386 --> 00:19:00,724
Let me get a light. Then we can all see,
and no one'll trip or anything.

101
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,852
Come on. Come on. Little piece of shit.

102
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,485
There. That's better.

103
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:15,864
The lights are a nice touch, Pritchett.
Subtle.

104
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,742
Thanks. Worked hard on it.
Could we move?

105
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,161
Guess we know where the Prices are.

106
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,039
Okay, let's go up further.

107
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,270
Goddamn, this place is scary, yo.

108
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,105
Where's the party?

109
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,691
Looks like we're it.

110
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,235
Me and y'all three?

111
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:37,738
Let's boogie.

112
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,365
Where's our host, the fabulous Mr. Price?

113
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:44,119
Fuck him.
What in the name of Christ is that?

114
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,128
lt must be more
of Price's spook-house bogeyman bullshit.

115
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,963
Actually...

116
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:58,342
...that's always been there.
Back when this was an asylum...

117
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,803
...Dr. Vannacutt found it inspirational.

118
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,057
lt's from the Middle Ages or something.

119
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,142
Driving Demons from the Mind.

120
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,645
Kind of scared me as a kid.

121
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,104
But...

122
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,983
...doesn't really scare me that much now.

123
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,781
lt's touching.

124
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,659
-Are you going to come in?
-No, l'm good.

125
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,496
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price?

126
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:29,832
Any...

127
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,000
...Price person?

128
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,961
l don't think anybody's here, man.

129
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,465
So maybe it was ghosts.

130
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,261
l knew this whole place
would be pure gold.

131
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,888
lf l can just get something bizarre enough
on tape...

132
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:48,392
...l think l can parlay it
into getting myself some sort of a...

133
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,519
...Wackiest Home Videos gig.

134
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,271
You got your own TV show?

135
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,190
Had, sweetie. Past tense.

136
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:59,111
Currently looking for the right angle
to either earn or fuck my way back in.

137
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,780
Looks like someone's trailer park
is showing.

138
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,366
l wouldn't worry.
l'm sure by the end of the night...

139
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,578
...we'll be hacked into pieces
by something or...

140
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,875
...somebody.

141
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,642
Who the fuck are all of you?

142
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,203
Oh, shit.

143
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,748
l thought you were dead.

144
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,708
Not even fucking close.

145
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,668
Get off of me, you pervert.

146
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,754
Congratulations.

147
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:08,347
l don't think Evelyn's said those words
to anything with testicles.

148
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:09,848
Ever.

149
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,683
Very funny, Steven.

150
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:12,935
Have you?

151
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:18,106
l think you're taking this awfully well
for a woman who was just nearly killed.

152
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:22,945
Well, l guess you'll just have
to try harder next time.

153
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,447
That is, if you can get it up.

154
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,783
Not me, tulip.

155
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,451
The house.

156
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:33,038
l think it's marked you to be the first
to die this evening.

157
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,749
lsn't that how the story goes,
Mr. Pritchett?

158
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,876
You could say that. Sure.

159
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,630
lsn't that how both your father
and grandfather met their demise?

160
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,929
Well, my grandfather did build the place...

161
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,932
...but he actually died in his sleep in Miami.

162
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,934
My father was killed here.

163
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:58,605
But that was during a construction
accident while he was restoring interiors.

164
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,816
But l'm fine and...

165
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,986
...l'm still alive, and l feel good...

166
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:07,990
...and l'd love to get paid now.

167
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,536
And on that mercenary note,
let the games begin.

168
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:16,165
Call me clairvoyant,
but haven't they already?

169
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:20,669
Finding that out is just one
of tonight's many amusements.

170
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:24,840
Sure is a funky old house, ain't it?

171
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,846
Let's have a word, sugarpuss.

172
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,515
l think we ought to have several.

173
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,606
This'll take a moment. You'll find food
and booze in the main salon.

174
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,482
Knock yourselves out.

175
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:08,300
I gave you a guest list two pages long.
Where the hell are they?

176
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,845
Shredded. Sorry.
Decided to whip up one of my own.

177
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,973
A group so hungry for money
they'd be willing to do anything.

178
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,559
l thought you'd be more comfortable
with your peers.

179
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,896
How stupid of me not to expect something
this twisted from you.

180
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,524
''Congratu-fucking-lations.'' Round one...

181
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:24,983
...you win.

182
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,903
Not quite. See, those people down there...

183
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,821
...they're not the ones l invited.

184
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,199
-Then who are they?
-You tell me.

185
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:36,119
l don't know how you managed
to hack into my computer, but...

186
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:37,246
...bravo!

187
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,415
Come on. You think l'd invite
that bunch of social rejects?

188
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,793
Sure know it wasn't me,
and if it wasn't you...

189
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:45,295
...then who the hell did? Ghosts?

190
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:48,090
Ooh, spooky.

191
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:53,095
lf you really loved me, you'd find a way
to drop dead in the next three seconds.

192
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:57,099
Finding ways for me to die
is really your deal, isn't it, Evelyn?

193
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,063
Let's not forget the O.J. knife
with the not quite retractable blade.

194
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:07,276
Your ''Jim Jones Kool Aid''
that was exactly that.

195
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:11,321
Accidents. All accidents
until proven otherwise.

196
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,950
l'd be so happy
if that were really true, Evelyn.

197
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,202
And positively goddamned delirious...

198
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:20,914
...if you weren't fucking every living thing
in our area code.

199
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,543
Which part of that fantasy
turns you on the most?

200
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,546
Me with other men, or just the other men?

201
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,633
Everything you do gets me hot,
just not in the sexual sense.

202
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,260
You're hurting me.

203
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,970
l know.

204
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:39,474
Well, there's the simple country gal
l married.

205
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,562
Let's go down and greet your guests.
Show them the real you.

206
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:46,023
Corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.

207
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:49,443
My guests were shredded.
lt's your sick little scene now.

208
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,611
Enjoy.

209
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:55,908
l'm going to run scalding water
on the place you just touched me...

210
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:58,076
...and then l'm calling a cab.

211
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:10,130
Mr. Price?

212
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:13,133
l think l've done a great job
of getting your guests here...

213
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,219
...and l think l deserve my money now!

214
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,095
Right here, Mr. Pritchett.

215
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:24,520
As well as five other bona fide bank drafts
for $1 million each.

216
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,272
Made out to cash.

217
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,194
That's what l'm talking about.
And we get paid this money when, sir?

218
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,196
The second the sun hits
tomorrow morning...

219
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,907
...assuming you've stayed the entire night.

220
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,660
And you're still alive, of course.

221
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,703
What are you talking about?

222
00:27:41,912 --> 00:27:45,833
Sorry. Detail l guess l forgot to mention.

223
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,459
You die, you lose.

224
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:50,796
Your check gets divvied up
by those still amongst the living.

225
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:54,925
But look at the bright side. lf there's
only one of you still upright at dawn...

226
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,053
...you leave here with $5 million
in your pocket.

227
00:27:58,387 --> 00:27:59,471
This is crazy.

228
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:00,639
Yes. But hey....

229
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:04,309
Anybody who's not comfortable
with the rules, you're free to walk.

230
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,311
Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.

231
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,564
l'm ready. l'll walk. Now.

232
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:16,196
All right, Mr. Pritchett,
just let me sign the damn thing.

233
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:19,950
Just for the record,
what are the rest of your names?

234
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:23,078
Donald W. Blackburn, MD.

235
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:27,457
Melissa Margaret Marr. Celebrity.

236
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,751
Eddie Baker. Pro....

237
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,337
Former pro baseball player.

238
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:37,134
And you, young lady?

239
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:41,597
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP,
Lathrup lnternational Pictures.

240
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:45,934
Very good.

241
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:49,438
Well, l think l can say
with complete honesty...

242
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,940
...l've never heard of any of you.

243
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,110
Great, then why are we here?

244
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:58,614
How did you make the guest list?
Throw darts at a phone book?

245
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:02,618
l'm sure the unexplainable
will explain herself before too long.

246
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:03,869
Jesus Christ.

247
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,371
That's it! Sorry to interrupt here.
Goddamn it!

248
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:09,291
You give me my goddamn check,
right now!

249
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,461
Because l want it! So you give it!

250
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,172
Now!

251
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,300
l'm serious!

252
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,011
l'm sorry, Pritchett.

253
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:27,809
Here you go.

254
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,021
-You'll miss the bash of a lifetime.
-My loss.

255
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,689
Even if l give you a million?

256
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:35,692
l wouldn't know what to do with it all.
Thank you.

257
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,666
l think l got to go now.

258
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:01,426
lnteresting.

259
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:11,937
Fuck!

260
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,044
Now that's ''enter-fucking-tainment''!

261
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,676
This ain't moving, man.

262
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,556
ls this your idea of a joke?

263
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:53,979
Pritchett's not laughing.

264
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:58,942
Open! Open!
Open, you stupid, asshole bitch!

265
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:00,569
What's going on?

266
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:02,821
What's going on?

267
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:04,573
Doctor.

268
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:07,534
-What happened here?
-Lockdown.

269
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:08,494
What is that?

270
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:11,413
A machine from the old asylum.
lt seals everything shut.

271
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:14,750
lt's how they burned to death in '31.
Dr. Vannacutt threw the switch.

272
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,711
lf he was going to die,
they were all going to die.

273
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:21,131
Well, no wonder they're still pissed off.

274
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:27,012
Let's go to the other room
and l'll take care of your hands.

275
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:30,224
The only survivors were five
of the sadists on Vannacutt's staff.

276
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,226
Why hasn't that machine been disabled?

277
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,062
lt was on my dad's to-do list,
but the house did him first.

278
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,147
You said that was an accident.

279
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:41,276
l lied. The house is alive.
We're all going to die.

280
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:48,659
Why doesn't one of us call out for help?

281
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,869
There aren't any working phones
in the house.

282
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,079
l've got my cell phone.

283
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,872
That won't do any good.

284
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:57,251
lt's the metal plates.

285
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,962
lt's not the plates.

286
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,257
lt's the house!
Why is no one listening to me?

287
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,884
Did you just turn deaf all of a sudden?

288
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:10,138
lt's alive! We're not going anywhere!
That's it!

289
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:12,015
So we're stuck here forever?

290
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:15,894
No, a cleaning crew's supposed to come
at 9:30 in the morning, Jesus!

291
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:17,896
So we'll just stay here till morning.

292
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,066
Yes, l'm sure we'll be mutilated
beyond recognition by then.

293
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:25,946
Why do l feel this is a sick joke to scare us
out of our wits and a lot of money?

294
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:29,324
You got that right.

295
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,243
Take a bow, you sick fuck.

296
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,413
You've outdone yourself tonight.

297
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:36,331
Scared the shit out of even me.

298
00:32:36,415 --> 00:32:39,626
You've had your fun. Open this place up.

299
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,088
Asking the wrong guy.
Wasn't me who closed it.

300
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:47,926
Sure it wasn't. Anybody else here make
a living with thrills and chills for the kids?

301
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,595
Don't all raise your hands at once.

302
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:52,806
You're that Steven Price?
As in Price Amusement Parks?

303
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,017
Bravo.

304
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,358
This lockdown thing, there's got to be
a main control room in this place, right?

305
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,944
ln the basement,
but you won't want to go there.

306
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,654
No, you don't want to go down there.

307
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:11,617
We will both go down there
and try to put a reverse on this thing.

308
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,870
You're not going to want to go down there.
lt's a maze.

309
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,331
Then that leaves you with two options.

310
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,542
Either show me where
and maybe we get out of here...

311
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:23,170
...or it's spend the night, sleep tight.

312
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:30,969
Fine.

313
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:33,347
A word of advice, kitten.

314
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:39,228
God knows what kind of freak-outs
Steven's got set to spring in here.

315
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:43,065
lf l were you,
l'd bring something to protect myself with.

316
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:49,655
Baby, don't you think now's the time
to break out your party favors?

317
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,448
What are you talking about?

318
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:55,077
Same exact setup you used back in '94
for the Son of Sam hunt.

319
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:37,119
Hilarious. Firearms this time.

320
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,122
Jesus Christ.

321
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:41,874
The clip's been welded shut.

322
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,792
On all of them, probably.

323
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:48,088
So how's a girl to know
if these things are loaded, puff?

324
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:50,591
Only one way l can think of.

325
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:01,977
No.

326
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:04,897
l think l'll let the virgin have first crack.

327
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,733
-l don't want a goddamn gun!
-l'll take it. Shit.

328
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:10,402
-Let's just go.
-l'll meet you all down there.

329
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:12,404
And where are we off to, Mr. Price?

330
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:14,907
Checking the wiring
on the animatronic mummies?

331
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,368
Just taking a leak if it's okay with you.

332
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:32,216
-Careful.
-l got to say...

333
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,843
...coming down here's a really good idea.

334
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:36,762
l know l'm having a great time.

335
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,473
Yes, well, you're not helping matters much.

336
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:42,351
Smells fantastic.

337
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,146
Ain't you handy to have around.

338
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,536
l love how nothing works.

339
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:04,832
Let me get you some light.

340
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,477
These things.

341
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:37,364
l knew l should have kept my ass at home.

342
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,271
-Damn.
-You're pretty handy yourself.

343
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,483
Take us where this thing's at.

344
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:19,615
-Come on, man.
-All right. Thank you. Got it.

345
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,250
Hey, Schecter!

346
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:34,588
Give me a few seconds notice
before you pull a stunt like that.

347
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:35,547
The lockdown thing?

348
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:38,967
-lmpressive! Scared all the right people--
-lt wasn't me.

349
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:41,428
What do you mean?

350
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:45,265
l was just sitting here and it happened.
l had nothing to do with it.

351
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:46,433
Then who did?

352
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:50,521
No idea. Maybe it was just
the thing's time to finally fall apart.

353
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:55,234
Somehow, l don't know how...

354
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,110
...she did it.

355
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:05,202
You should really open up this place
to the public, Pritchett.

356
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:08,247
A spa for people without enough stress
in their lives.

357
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,915
That's funny. Sharp.

358
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,168
l'm the one who didn't want
to come down here, remember?

359
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:16,171
There haven't been any changes
to this part of the house...

360
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:19,341
...since, l don't know, 1931.

361
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,677
ls that a fact, Mr. Pritchett?

362
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,636
Sorry.

363
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,805
That's a good way
to get your head blown off.

364
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,807
l'll recommend it to Evelyn.

365
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,560
What's in there?

366
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:33,939
Someone went to a lot of trouble
trying to seal that up.

367
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,275
l don't know. l've never been in there.

368
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:38,110
But it's not the way out.

369
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:43,198
Let's go down here and take a right.

370
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,077
This is electroshock therapy.

371
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:32,498
There's several of these rooms
hooked together.

372
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:36,084
Dr. Vannacutt liked to zap his patients
in multiples of 18.

373
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:38,253
More energy efficient, l guess.

374
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,255
lsn't that pleasant.

375
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,678
How about we go?

376
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:47,888
Great.

377
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:15,290
Oh, shit.

378
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:20,879
Guess we should have made a left.

379
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,756
What is this?

380
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:26,260
This is the saturation chamber.

381
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,512
What's a saturation chamber?

382
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,306
lt's Vannacutt's treatment
for schizophrenia.

383
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,393
What would drive a sane man mad
would drive a mad man sane.

384
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:37,104
Something like that.
l don't know. Whatever.

385
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,441
lt's supposed to bombard them
with images and weird noises...

386
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,652
...and scare them back to normal.

387
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,321
Lot of fun.

388
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:47,906
Did it work?

389
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:49,700
l don't know.

390
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,326
Did it work?

391
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,329
Oh, fuck.

392
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:55,998
Guys?

393
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,681
l do not want to be lost down here.

394
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,044
This is not cool.

395
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,881
Let me try something.

396
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,676
Can you get me up?

397
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:52,221
Here, watch out.

398
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:00,395
Hey, pal...

399
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,898
...that wasn't code for....

400
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:04,399
For what?

401
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:08,570
Could you just shine the light here?

402
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:09,947
Absolutely.

403
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:14,368
All right.

404
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:16,119
What are you looking for?

405
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:19,540
This whole place can't be wired
to just one circuit.

406
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:27,089
Careful.

407
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:34,721
Better than nothing.

408
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:35,806
Not bad.

409
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,599
Down, big guy.

410
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,608
Thanks.

411
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:49,319
That was the most fun l've had all day.

412
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,239
You need to get out more.

413
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:01,957
So who are you...

414
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,584
...really?

415
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:06,962
What? You mean like deep down inside?

416
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:11,091
We can start with the name
you were given at birth, take it from there.

417
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,261
l told you already.
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP--

418
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:16,805
You're lying. And l don't think so.

419
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:17,890
Why not?

420
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:20,893
l've never met an executive
who could tie their shoes...

421
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:23,478
...much less rewire an entire building.

422
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,898
-Well, there's always exceptions.
-No.

423
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,232
What's the truth?

424
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:31,278
The truth is, if we keep taking rights,
we'll end up where we started.

425
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:37,784
We'll be out of here in a while and go
our separate ways a $1 million richer.

426
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:40,746
So what does it matter
who l am or who l'm not?

427
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:45,000
Okay, so let's say, hypothetically,
l'm not exactly who l said l was.

428
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,085
So you're right, you're a genius.

429
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:50,631
l don't know anyone that could've seen
through me like that.

430
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,801
Look...

431
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,387
...my real name is Sara,
and l'm an assistant.

432
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:02,184
Was, anyway, to the real Jennifer bitch
that was invited here.

433
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:05,521
And now you know. And l'm begging
that you don't tell anyone...

434
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:09,650
...because l'm out of a job and could use
even a tenth of that money.

435
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:29,878
You know, if this is your idea of funny,
think again.

436
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:44,518
ln fact, you're really starting to piss me off.

437
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:49,565
Eddie, wait!

438
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,277
For a second l actually thought
that you were a decent guy.

439
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:40,115
What is your problem?

440
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,142
Okay, you win.

441
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:11,021
You've successfully creeped me out.

442
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:39,758
What are you doing?

443
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:06,785
Come on!

444
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:08,370
Take my hand!

445
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,008
What the hell are you doing?

446
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:49,578
Well, lookie.
Looks like the games have begun.

447
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:52,039
-Where's Price?
-What happened to you?

448
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:53,499
Are you all right?

449
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:56,960
No, l am so fucking far
from all right it's not even funny.

450
00:47:57,085 --> 00:48:01,715
Someone or something just tried
to drown me in a tank of blood.

451
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:04,718
Let me give you a hint.

452
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:06,512
His initials are S.P.

453
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,765
All right. S.P.

454
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:12,100
As in ''sorry, petunia.''

455
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:15,354
l was with Pritchett,
looking for the master control.

456
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:18,482
lt doesn't seem to exist.

457
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:20,108
Look at this.

458
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:22,402
What is this?

459
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:25,489
That? What just happened to you?
That's nothing.

460
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:28,659
Wait'll somebody lets out the darkness
in this place.

461
00:48:28,784 --> 00:48:32,287
That's a whole new bunch of crazy shit.
You'll hate that shit.

462
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,081
What is this darkness?

463
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,291
lt! The thing! The evil!

464
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:39,461
The thing that's the rotten core
at the bottom of this place!

465
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:43,549
The thing that's going to kill us all!
Death by corrosion. That thing!

466
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:50,639
-Are you under the care of a physician?
-No, l'm not.

467
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,141
Well...

468
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:56,895
...either we spend the night
and collect our money...

469
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:59,731
...or we try to find a way out of here.

470
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:02,609
Either way,
l think we should all stick together.

471
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:06,321
But maybe that's not going to fit in
with your plans, baby.

472
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:09,658
You know me. The more, the merrier.

473
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:14,246
l guess somebody better go find
the old game-show hostess.

474
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,664
Where is she?

475
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,809
This is great.

476
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,553
l guess Melissa found
what she was looking for.

477
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,190
Jesus. She's dead.

478
00:51:47,649 --> 00:51:49,276
She was cute too.

479
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:52,654
God, l'd love to get laid before l died.

480
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:57,743
How you doing tonight?

481
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:03,248
Yes, l'm all right.

482
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:09,755
ls she all right?

483
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:12,090
l don't know.

484
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:25,479
What the hell is this?

485
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,446
lt seems to just stop here.

486
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:37,699
Shit, she's got to be somewhere...

487
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:41,703
...because she couldn't have
just disappeared into thin air.

488
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:44,957
Not air.

489
00:52:57,594 --> 00:52:59,012
lnto the house.

490
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:06,228
There's got to be a way out of this house.

491
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,813
Some way.

492
00:53:09,148 --> 00:53:10,023
What?

493
00:53:10,149 --> 00:53:11,400
l'm talking to you!

494
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:14,403
-What is your deal? That wasn't nice.
-Easy! Easy!

495
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,906
lf everyone's going to scream at
each other, do it in another room.

496
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,158
Watch it!

497
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:22,911
l'm about to figure out exactly what,
or who, Melissa was taping.

498
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:24,872
Then where will we be?

499
00:53:24,955 --> 00:53:27,291
Out of scotch, thanks to you, ass!

500
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:31,336
l think l got something.

501
00:54:04,036 --> 00:54:04,953
Bravo.

502
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,502
l know it's not good manners
to ask the magician how he did it...

503
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:13,712
...but inquiring minds
are desperate to know.

504
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:16,632
Just what did really happen
to little Miss Marr?

505
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,512
Asking the wrong person.

506
00:54:21,887 --> 00:54:25,224
l mean, did she stage it all for you
and then go hide?

507
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:28,644
Or did you just flat out kill the little bitch?

508
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,646
l pose you the same question.

509
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,397
Who's next on your list?

510
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:35,818
lf l had one, Evelyn, whom do you think?

511
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:40,197
For God sakes, we all know that
knocking me off is the bottom line here.

512
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:45,160
You know l'm not going
to make it easy for you.

513
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:49,623
You think that's going to do the trick,
do you, tulip?

514
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:51,917
l would never give you a loaded gun.

515
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:55,420
Jesus!

516
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:58,590
Funky old house, ain't it?

517
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:06,431
Friends, your hostess is now going
to retire for what's left of the night.

518
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:09,601
lf you need me,
l'll be upstairs in the bedroom.

519
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:13,105
And if anyone so much
as peeks in the keyhole...

520
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:16,650
...l'm going to empty this thing
into their fucking head.

521
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:30,956
Come on.

522
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:33,250
l loaded them with blanks.

523
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,922
And even if l were going
to murder my wife...

524
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:43,177
...l don't think l'd do it in a locked house
with quite so many witnesses.

525
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:45,262
Take this.

526
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:51,643
What good is a million dollars
if you're dead?

527
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,025
Let's find a way to get out of here.

528
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:01,820
l'm going to try to find Ms. Marr.

529
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:08,660
l'm going to go find me something to drink.

530
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:15,000
How is she pulling this off?

531
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:57,042
Ms. Marr?

532
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:16,770
You son of a bitch, l know you're here.

533
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,046
What is happening?

534
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:29,176
Electroshock!

535
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:43,982
Oh, Jesus.

536
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:46,610
God, no!

537
00:58:47,277 --> 00:58:48,403
Don't touch her!

538
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:49,905
Well, turn it off!

539
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,951
For God's sake, somebody do something!

540
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:57,621
Somebody turn the damn thing off!

541
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,336
Somebody! Do something!

542
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:07,381
Turn it off!

543
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:11,510
There's got to be a switch or something!

544
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,656
l'm sorry.

545
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:35,617
She's not dead.
We must get her heart pumping again.

546
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:36,952
lt's too late.

547
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,682
Baby, l'm so sorry.

548
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:04,438
l swear to God, it's this house.

549
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:05,814
Fuck the house!

550
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,150
lt wasn't the house!

551
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:10,527
lt wasn't goddamn ghosts!

552
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:13,906
This is, plain and simple,
good old-fashioned homicide.

553
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:21,288
ls it too complicated for you?
Let me spell it out for you then, kids.

554
01:00:21,371 --> 01:00:23,957
A: Evelyn sure as hell didn't kill herself.

555
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:26,627
B: l know l didn't do it.
Which just leaves us with C.

556
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,880
One of you motherfuckers
murdered my wife!

557
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:32,007
You're talking crazy, Price.

558
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:36,678
Who'll tell me about the strange guy
with the mustache and the lab coat...

559
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:39,848
...who l've been chasing
all over this goddamn house?

560
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:41,266
Vannacutt.

561
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:42,559
Jesus.

562
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:45,521
Some little shit...

563
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:49,149
...working for one of you,
hoping to pocket several million bucks.

564
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:50,943
Now l want some answers.

565
01:00:53,946 --> 01:00:55,447
Put that away.

566
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:58,325
Put the gun down, Mr. Price.

567
01:00:58,575 --> 01:00:59,660
Back up, honey.

568
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,120
There's a one in four chance it's you.

569
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:05,123
Put the gun down!

570
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:07,292
Let's see who blinks first.

571
01:01:34,153 --> 01:01:35,821
What do we do with him?

572
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:45,706
Open this fucking door!

573
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,503
-You sure this thing will hold him?
-lt won't be a problem.

574
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:55,674
Come on.

575
01:01:58,343 --> 01:02:00,596
You going to make sure
he doesn't get out?

576
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,264
l'll stay and keep an eye on him.

577
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:03,891
You'll be okay by yourself?

578
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:05,184
l hope.

579
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:13,066
l have to tell you,
l'm just a little bit uncomfortable with this.

580
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,526
l'm sure you are.

581
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,202
Open the goddamn door!

582
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,540
What?

583
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:32,711
Open the goddamn door!

584
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:38,217
l can't! l'm sorry, l can't.

585
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:44,056
What's this?

586
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:47,226
This!

587
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:52,648
Anything?

588
01:02:52,731 --> 01:02:54,149
Open this fucking door!

589
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:55,818
How about this?

590
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:08,080
Better?

591
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:19,258
Great party!

592
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:21,593
l got to go!

593
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,095
Blackburn!

594
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:41,280
Wrong way. l think we should
have taken a right back there.

595
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:42,948
Back where?

596
01:03:43,282 --> 01:03:44,992
Damn it. Good point.

597
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:49,121
Let's just try down here.

598
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:00,799
Yo, Sara, look.

599
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:04,678
Vannacutt's office.

600
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:56,915
You've been sick, Mr. Price.

601
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:03,297
And what do you think, Dr. Vannacutt?

602
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:43,772
Look here.

603
01:07:44,648 --> 01:07:46,233
What do you got?

604
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,360
Class of 1931.

605
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:50,946
That's a cheery-looking bunch.

606
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:53,532
Better living through electricity.

607
01:07:58,036 --> 01:07:59,204
l think--

608
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:04,376
Oh, my God!

609
01:08:05,502 --> 01:08:07,671
l know how the guest list was made.

610
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:09,298
Look at these names.

611
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:11,300
''Head nurse, Ruthe Ann Stockard.

612
01:08:11,383 --> 01:08:13,385
''Electroshock, Adolphus Jenzen.

613
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,636
''Franklin Baker.

614
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,972
''Thomas Steven Price. Jasper Marr.''

615
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:19,808
-They're all here!
-Who? l'm missing something.

616
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:21,810
Everyone that was invited...

617
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:25,814
...is related to one of the staff
that was here when the place burnt.

618
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:28,901
There was five of us.

619
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:32,154
Five that didn't die.

620
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:33,864
Booga-booga.

621
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:37,159
What are you saying?

622
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:38,827
Price didn't make the list.

623
01:08:38,911 --> 01:08:40,162
The house did.

624
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,211
Because she's a vengeful, stupid whore!

625
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,674
How's the house going
to send out invitations?

626
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:54,843
There's a lot of energy in here.

627
01:08:55,677 --> 01:08:58,222
lt likes to travel through light beams...

628
01:08:58,305 --> 01:08:59,765
...sound waves...

629
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:01,517
...electricity, whatever.

630
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,810
A phone line?

631
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:06,522
Sure, now that we're in The Twilight Zone.

632
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:09,983
lnto an on-line computer?
Through the lnternet?

633
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:13,278
No, stop. Wait. This is crazy.

634
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:15,697
You don't...

635
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:17,991
...get it, do you?

636
01:09:21,954 --> 01:09:25,290
This house is pissed.

637
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:27,459
lt has no morals.

638
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:31,713
Because it's a fucking house!

639
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,048
This is insane.

640
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:36,343
-Calm down.
-All right, l'm sorry about that.

641
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:41,807
Wait.

642
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:46,353
How come Blackburn's name's not on here?

643
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:15,966
The late Mrs. Steven Price. Tragic.

644
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,513
Tortured.

645
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:24,808
Lovely.

646
01:10:35,027 --> 01:10:38,697
And suddenly very cooperative Mrs. Price.

647
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:53,378
Cool.

648
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:11,730
What do you think you're doing?

649
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:17,694
Easy. Easy. Lie back. Be still.

650
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:21,031
Last thing we need is for you
to have a real heart attack.

651
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:23,075
You're the doctor, kid.

652
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:26,036
l guess that atropine crap worked.

653
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:28,539
Yes. Convinced all those
that needed convincing.

654
01:11:28,622 --> 01:11:31,416
You are officially one dead lady.

655
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,752
Trust me, l've been dead for years.

656
01:11:34,086 --> 01:11:36,755
Speaking of which, what's Steven's status?

657
01:11:36,922 --> 01:11:38,632
Well, he's still alive...

658
01:11:38,715 --> 01:11:41,093
...but it's just a question of moments.

659
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:44,930
And then your miraculous resurrection.

660
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:48,976
No, Officer, l'm very much alive.

661
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:52,312
Just a little joke to beat my husband
at his own clever game.

662
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:54,314
l'm sorry, ma'am, your husband's dead.

663
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:57,359
What do you mean, he's dead?
Oh, no, it's all my fault.

664
01:11:57,442 --> 01:11:59,778
l may as well have killed him myself.

665
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:03,282
No, not at all.
We have all these witnesses that saw....

666
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:06,285
Well, fill in the blank,
whoever it'll be that shoots him.

667
01:12:06,368 --> 01:12:08,120
l don't know. Puff Eddie?

668
01:12:08,954 --> 01:12:13,667
This could be a big surprise. l think
the Jenzen girl. She's got the right stuff.

669
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:17,880
Did you ever find out what happened
to that little TV reporter?

670
01:12:19,798 --> 01:12:21,383
No, we never found her.

671
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:24,511
So we don't even know
if the bitch is dead or alive.

672
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:29,600
Price must've killed her.
There's no other explanation.

673
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:34,396
There's plenty! For all we know
Steven's got her spying on us right now!

674
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:35,981
Bullshit.

675
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:38,609
God, this whole fucking thing's
falling apart.

676
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,110
lt's not, baby, it's not.

677
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:41,904
Somebody'll pull the trigger.

678
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:44,281
But nobody has yet, Donald.

679
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,074
They're not at the breaking point.

680
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:48,243
They must believe their lives are in danger!

681
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:51,330
They have your death at his hands.
How much more do they need?

682
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:52,915
But they didn't see it happen.

683
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:55,751
They still have their doubts.
They're confused.

684
01:12:58,212 --> 01:12:59,838
What we need...

685
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:01,673
...is another body...

686
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:04,676
...and Steven's bloody hands
right next to it.

687
01:13:05,177 --> 01:13:07,471
How the hell are we going to do that?

688
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:13,101
This may sound a little crazy,
but hear me out.

689
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:05,487
This is all l could find.

690
01:14:11,243 --> 01:14:12,578
This here.

691
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:15,789
Well, it's going to have to do.

692
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:19,626
Are you coming, or waiting for Blackburn?

693
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:21,712
Blackburn's dead.

694
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,505
Excuse me?

695
01:14:23,714 --> 01:14:25,757
He would've been back by now.

696
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:29,553
He's dead.

697
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:08,592
Oh, shit.

698
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:19,978
Shit.

699
01:15:25,317 --> 01:15:28,821
-Where is he?
-He's got to still be down here.

700
01:15:28,987 --> 01:15:31,907
-He's dead! We're all going to be dead!
-Stop saying that!

701
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,076
Pritchett, shut the fuck up!

702
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:36,495
l just wanted to ask you a question.

703
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:40,415
-Price is behind this.
-How? He's still locked up.

704
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:42,000
Let's go see.

705
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:47,798
lt's Blackburn.

706
01:15:59,977 --> 01:16:01,061
Oh, my God.

707
01:16:01,145 --> 01:16:02,146
Shit!

708
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:17,244
You murderer.

709
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,396
Melissa?

710
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:51,028
lt's Sara.

711
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:54,698
Help me.

712
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:58,660
-Somebody!
-l'll help you.

713
01:16:58,952 --> 01:17:00,913
Just keep talking.

714
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:19,181
lt's okay.

715
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:31,777
l woke up on the floor.

716
01:17:33,278 --> 01:17:34,488
Blackburn....

717
01:17:36,615 --> 01:17:38,075
Stay the fuck back!

718
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:40,118
l don't know what happened!

719
01:17:40,786 --> 01:17:41,954

720
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:46,792
Please, tell me. Help me.

721
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,294
l don't think so!

722
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:51,421
You got to help me.

723
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:56,760
Not even for $1 million, Mr. Price.

724
01:18:01,932 --> 01:18:03,267
Help me.

725
01:18:05,018 --> 01:18:06,019
Help me.

726
01:18:27,124 --> 01:18:28,167
Oh, shit!

727
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:31,837
Grab her gun.

728
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:34,673
Damn, she emptied it. l got this.

729
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,842
l got this, baby girl. Let go.

730
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:38,302
There we go.

731
01:18:40,512 --> 01:18:41,930
l'll put this right here.

732
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:43,724
Okay? Look, it's cool.

733
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:45,058
lt's me. Okay, it's me.

734
01:18:45,142 --> 01:18:46,185
Look.

735
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:47,269
Poor Mr. Price.

736
01:18:47,352 --> 01:18:49,062
Fuck Mr. Price.

737
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,982
Come on, baby girl. l got you.

738
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:54,943
-Come on, it's cool.
-Let's get the hell out of here.

739
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:56,361
l got you.

740
01:18:57,529 --> 01:19:00,324
Okay, don't look. Keep going. Up we go.

741
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:02,075
Up we go, baby girl.

742
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:07,414
Almost there. You just get upstairs.

743
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:10,000
All right, easy. Don't look.

744
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:41,448
You poor clueless old geek.

745
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:44,701
All it would've taken
was a simple divorce...

746
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:49,414
...and ripping our prenup to teeny,
itsy-bitsy little pieces.

747
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:54,586
But no matter how it ended...

748
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:57,422
...please just know one thing:

749
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:01,135
From the first moment l set eyes on you...

750
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:04,972
...l have always, always loved...

751
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:07,432
...your money.

752
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:16,108
On the other hand, just the sight of you
has always made me want to puke.

753
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,487
ls that a fact, princess?

754
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:24,658
Maybe you could have saved us all
a great deal of time...

755
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:28,370
...not to mention money,
if you just let me in on it years ago.

756
01:20:28,453 --> 01:20:29,746
Help!

757
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:33,083
You must be kidding!

758
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:38,505
l'm Steven goddamn Price!

759
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,305
Every place you've gone,
every person you've seen...

760
01:20:46,472 --> 01:20:49,892
...every word you and Blackburn
ever said to each other, bugged...

761
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:53,770
...taped, seen and heard
by me as it happened!

762
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:56,315
-Sweetie?
-Anything, angel!

763
01:20:56,482 --> 01:20:57,774
Just speak it!

764
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:00,319
What are you going to do?

765
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:06,909
Just what you wanted everyone here
to believe in the first place!

766
01:21:06,992 --> 01:21:11,163
l'm going to murder you, Evelyn,
with the greatest of pleasure!

767
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:12,873
Witnesses.

768
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:18,337
They know you're already dead, Evelyn!

769
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:21,006
Happy birthday, baby!

770
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:48,700
Get up.

771
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:51,745
Are you doing this?

772
01:21:52,371 --> 01:21:53,413
No.

773
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:57,084
Get up!

774
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,711
Now!

775
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,653
Oh, Ms. Marr.

776
01:23:41,814 --> 01:23:43,857
Steven, l want you.

777
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:46,568
l've always wanted you.

778
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:49,154
We all do.

779
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:53,367
They're all here.

780
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:55,869
Everyone who's died.

781
01:23:56,787 --> 01:23:59,164
Everyone who's responsible.

782
01:24:00,624 --> 01:24:02,459
lt's your turn.

783
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:07,130
One, two, three.

784
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:36,034
Open the door!

785
01:24:36,535 --> 01:24:38,871
-Somebody open the door!
-Oh, my God.

786
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:41,748
lt's Price.

787
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:45,335
Open the goddamn door!

788
01:24:47,254 --> 01:24:48,714
Price is dead.

789
01:24:49,173 --> 01:24:51,258
Open the goddamn door!

790
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:58,515
Open the goddamn door!

791
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,750
Go!

792
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:29,463
Run!

793
01:25:40,724 --> 01:25:41,934
Come on!

794
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:50,317
What was that?

795
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:52,611
lt can't be! You're dead!

796
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:57,407
Pritchett was right. The house is alive.

797
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:05,874
There's got to be something.
Pulleys or something.

798
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:08,752
The attic!

799
01:26:42,995 --> 01:26:44,204
Come on!

800
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,228
Let's get to the attic!

801
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:09,688
Hurry!

802
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:18,363
Come on!

803
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:32,085
Terrific!

804
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:33,795
Fuck!

805
01:27:49,728 --> 01:27:52,397
So much for a Ph.D. in engineering.

806
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:55,901
l found a way out!

807
01:27:56,026 --> 01:27:57,236
Where?

808
01:27:57,444 --> 01:27:58,529
Up here!

809
01:27:58,737 --> 01:28:01,824
Hurry! There is something
of a time issue here.

810
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:17,131
Come on!

811
01:28:17,548 --> 01:28:19,258
Where are you going?

812
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:22,886
You have to stay for my show.

813
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,638
Oh, God!

814
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:43,615
There's light! Stay here, l'm going
to go and see if we can get out this way.

815
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:11,101
Oh, shit.

816
01:29:19,318 --> 01:29:20,527
Go!

817
01:30:21,588 --> 01:30:22,965
Help me, Eddie!

818
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:25,968
The doctor is in.

819
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:30,889
No one gets out of here alive.

820
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:34,893
Not me. Not you.

821
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:38,897
Next patient.

822
01:30:39,106 --> 01:30:41,108
Ah, Mr. Baker.

823
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:44,444
lt's time to take your rightful place
with the others.

824
01:30:44,528 --> 01:30:46,280
l had nothing to do with this!

825
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:48,073
l was adopted!

826
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:21,398
Oh, God.

827
01:31:44,296 --> 01:31:45,380
What is this?

828
01:31:55,599 --> 01:31:56,934
What is it?

829
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:30,092
Oh, my God.

830
01:32:31,885 --> 01:32:33,971
That was one kick-ass party.

831
01:32:34,179 --> 01:32:38,475
Okay, one more thing:
how do we get down from here?
