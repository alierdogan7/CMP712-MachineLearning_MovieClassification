RESURRECTION
by Russell Mulcahy

3
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,140
- Prudhomme.
- John, sorry to call you so early.

4
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,740
- I was up.
- We got a problem.

5
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,640
What time is it?

6
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,140
Is early.

7
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,040
Ok. I make you some breakfast.

8
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,740
I don't have time.
Go back to sleep.

9
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,740
Yeah. The old man says,
I get a hard-on once a week...

10
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,740
but I fart at least
ten times a day

11
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,540
- Good morning, John.
- Keep them away, Mac.

12
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:51,906
Ok. Stay back!

13
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,940
- You've been inside?
- No, I just got here.

14
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,340
Hey how does a blonde turn on
the lights after sex?

15
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,540
She opens the car door.

16
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,240
- I don't know why I'm wasting my good jokes on you?
- I don't know either.

17
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,140
Prudhomme. What are
you doing here?

18
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,240
- I got the call.
- Bullshit. We run at the scene first.

19
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,840
- I got the call!
- What's the deal, man?

20
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,740
You don't have enough cases
that you need more?

21
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,040
- Where's the body?
- I asked you a question.

22
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,140
Hey! He just doing what
they told him to do.

23
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,928
Hollinsworth, I'm not talking to you.

24
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:27,640
Oh, you're not talking to me, Scholfield.
Yeah, well... I'm talking to you.

25
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,140
So what is it?
Are you better than everybody else?

26
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,540
Nobody can do it as good as you do?
We're all idiots here?

27
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,440
I don't see the point
of this conversation.

28
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,640
The point is the reason why
nobody likes you.

29
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,140
I like you.

30
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,040
He's a little ripe, but a...
He's been dead for four days.

31
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,540
- Who is he?
- Peter Balcour. He owned the place.

32
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,540
Who found him?

33
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,540
Contractor who had
an appoinment with him.

34
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,490
It seems Balcour's old man was
a little bit reckless

35
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,387
Owned a large fleet of fishing boats...

36
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:10,747
He died a couple of months ago
and left everything to his son...

37
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,037
Balcour had an appointment
to the contractor...

38
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:14,303
...to fix the place up to sale it.

39
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,940
Any other family?

40
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,362
Contractor said the kid
was end of the line.

41
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:23,685
- Anything taken?
- You mean besides his arm?

42
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,862
No. We did find his wallet in his
jacket pocket with 112 dollars in.

43
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,740
Was he alive when
he lost the arm?

44
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,240
Yeah. If you check out
the blood splatter.

45
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,840
Take a look at this.

46
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,240
He has some kind of
strange burn effect here.

47
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,840
And the back of his
head is all singed.

48
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,340
- What is it?
- I don't know.

49
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,440
I have to verify all that
when I get him back to the shop.

50
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,840
Any more light in here?

51
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,440
No, that's it. I didn't wanna touch
anything so I left the curtains closed.

52
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,053
- Open them.
- Sure.

53
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:25,006
- Do you finished that report?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:25,137
- Thanks.
- OK.

55
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,753
Do you think this guy is
somewhere in New York city?

56
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:31,831
I'll get in touch with NYPD
and when they get him, I'll get his ass!

57
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,987
Hey Jack, can I get one
of those papers?

58
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,140
Prudhomme, Hollinsworth.
In my office.

59
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,740
Rousch and Scholfield were just in here
preaching about you stealing their case.

60
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,240
They can have it if they want it.

61
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,740
This is not a democracy, Prudhomme.
It's your case.

62
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,140
- I gave it to you.
- Then what's the problem?

63
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,740
The problem is you pissed 'em off.

64
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,740
Hollinsworth is the only one in the entire
department who wants to work with you.

65
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,940
I don't know how would it
like in New Orleans...

66
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,040
but since you came here you got
through one partner after another.

67
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,440
Did you bring me in here to talk
about my social skills?

68
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,840
Talking to you is like
pissing into the wind.

69
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,940
I bet you should know
better by now.

70
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,640
What do you got?

71
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,940
Peter Balcour, 33 year old, male.

72
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,340
Owner of a fleet of fishing boats.

73
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,740
And his right arm cut
off up his shoulder.

74
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,240
The killer, we presume,
took it with him when he left.

75
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,940
Took it where? Like a souvenir?

76
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,840
That's somethin' new.
Witnesses?

77
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,940
No, but the killer
left us a message...

78
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,840
...written in blood.

79
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,940
- Prints?
- Forensic is cheking.

80
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,640
- We won't find any prints.
- How the hell do you know that?

81
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:53,940
Because he doesn't want us to.

82
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,140
- And also there be more bodies.
- You don't know that.

83
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,273
- For all you know, this... What's his name?
- Balcour

84
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,740
Balcour sort out a customer
on a case of tuna.

85
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,640
The guy cut his arm off and pull
out this bullshit to throw us track.

86
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,140
The killer wrote "He is
coming on the window.

87
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,240
That signifies a future event
that isn't taking place yet.

88
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,640
This guy has something worked out
and today was just his first move.

89
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,340
If this is all planned,
what's the motive?

90
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Whe already know the motive.
The killer wanted his arm.

91
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,140
That's a motive.

92
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,440
Would it be to much of asking to have
a cheeseburguer any once in a while?

93
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,940
Why do you think
he took the arm for?

94
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,740
Do we have to talk
about this over lunch?

95
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,440
I don't know. Obviously we're not dealing
with someone who is paying food back here.

96
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,540
God only knows what is doing.

97
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,140
Maybe we got another
Jeffrey Dhammer.

98
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,940
Why don't take the whole body?

99
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,440
Maybe he only wanted a snack.

100
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,740
Jenny call today.
She's coming to visit us.

101
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,240
Again?

102
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,640
Yes, again.
What? Is there a problem?

103
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,440
No but the last time she
came for a weekend...

104
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,940
...she stayed two weeks.

105
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,140
She's my best friend. What I'm supossed
to tell her? Stay in a hotel?

106
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,340
Hey, are you OK?

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Yeah. Just... Thinking.

108
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,940
About that case?
I saw it on the news.

109
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,940
This world just keep getting sicker
and sicker everyday.

110
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,440
Why would someone do
such a thing?

111
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,140
I don't want to talk about it.

112
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,940
Well, I'm not asking details.
I'm just asking your opinion.

113
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,140
I said I don't want
to talk about it!

114
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,140
And the fat guy said: I though I was gonna
scream when I came out of the closet.

115
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Prudhomme.

116
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,640
Do you know the exact cause of death?

117
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,340
Yeah. Exanguination. That means
he bleed to death.

118
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,340
He also has some burns on the right
side of his parietal region.

119
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,140
Looks like he was tortured with a
taser or some kind of cattle prod.

120
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,640
It didn't kill him but
probably knocked him out.

121
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,040
So he was unconcious when
his arm was taken?

122
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,040
No, unfortunaley he was.

123
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,440
His endorphine and adrenaline
were incredible high in his blood.

124
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,640
Which means he was
wide awake. He...

125
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,205
He experienced a severe
trauma just before he died.

126
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,840
You tell me that he waited for
him to wake up before cut his arm off?

127
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,745
- Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.
- How sick is that?

128
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:40,649
I can also tell you that
whoever this guy is...

129
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:41,740
...he knows what he is doing...

130
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,940
...because he removed that arm
with almost surgical precision.

131
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,740
This guy is no Jack the Ripper.
You might be interested in this.

132
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
- Roman numerals.
- What's that?

133
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,864
Oh, yeah. Is a keymark and
is tinted permanently.

134
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,740
Let me check the neck.

135
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,740
Bismark Locker Services.

136
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,540
Over there.

137
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,340
Bingo!

138
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,740
Can you identify it?

139
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,040
Brachiate Serafolios.

140
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,140
Is a flower from the Bonewood tree.

141
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,105
Where I can find it around here?

142
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,040
- You cant. Is indigenous to Australia.
- We're not in Australia.

143
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,340
I can see why they
made you detective.

144
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,340
- What about the Botanical Museum?
- I don't think so.

145
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,740
This flower was picked
only a few days ago.

146
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,840
There is one however
at the Botanical Gardens.

147
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,040
There's your flower.

148
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
- Billy?
- Got it.

149
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,140
Hey Prudhomme...

150
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,340
This whole area was being
cut out and made back in.

151
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,906
- Spread out.
- Why not?

152
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:14,638
Oh, my God...

153
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:18,234
Jesus!

154
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,040
Call Chibley and
call this place down.

155
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
How difficult could be for someone
afor get in here at night?

156
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,740
Not very difficult. All we have is
a wall around the property.

157
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,240
No security?

158
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,840
This isn't a bank.
All we have are plants here.

159
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,040
Prudhomme?

160
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Andy...

161
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,540
His arm is been removed.

162
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,740
What's that?

163
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,340
This guy likes to play
with numbers. Doesn't he?

164
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,640
Prints identify him as
Matthew Leesan, age 33.

165
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,540
He works for the I.R.S.

166
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,240
It seems our killer's taste
in victims is improving.

167
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,940
To be exact he was killed before
Balcour and at different location.

168
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
The killer moved this
body to the Gardens.

169
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,738
Why go into all that trouble?
First being in scene.

170
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,240
What about the numbers
on the victims?

171
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,999
- Actually, they're numerals.
- What?

172
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,877
- They're roman numerals.
- And numerals aren't numbers?

173
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,040
All I'm saying is I think the killer
choose numerals for a reason.

174
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,740
119...

175
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,340
2427.

176
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,940
Numbers, numerals

177
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,940
So far, we're only found
what he wants us to find.

178
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,340
No prints. No trace evidence. Nothing.

179
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,940
What we got here is a
very clever serial killer.

180
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,340
Guys, the lab just called down.

181
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,840
The blood on the window
wasn't Balcour's.

182
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,040
- From whom it was, then? Killer's?
- It wasn't anybody's.

183
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,140
Lab says it wasn't human.

184
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,240
Says it was lamb's blood.

185
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,940
Do you wanna play?

186
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,940
That's it, my baby.

187
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,740
You wanna play?.

188
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,940
No!

189
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
- Who called it in?
- I did.

190
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,240
- Where is it?
- Over here.

191
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,440
Right down here, getleman.

192
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,940
Watch your steps is a
mess down here.

193
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,240
Transients, druggies, whatever...

194
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,940
All kinds of shit happens
to live down here.

195
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,240
Fuck! It stinks!

196
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,940
Yeah, is too easy to go outside
and relieved themselves.

197
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,240
- How do you come across in?
- One of the bodies slided down.

198
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,240
Lots of rats in this city!

199
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,840
Here is something you
don't see every day.

200
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,340
It's in there.

201
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,240
Oh my God!

202
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,540
Oh my God!

203
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,387
Oh my God!

204
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
What's this guy wanna find?

205
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,040
Is like a shopping list or somethin'?

206
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Where's his head?

207
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,440
There's a guy sitting in front of me here.
Where's his head, John?

208
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,740
I'm sorry

209
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,740
Where is Chibley?

210
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,440
He's on his way.

211
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,640
One plastic comb, about
1,25 in change and pack of gum...

212
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,040
Oh yeah. And a wallet.
One James Ordway.

213
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,340
- You done?
- Yeah.

214
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,740
I got a pretty good
idea what killed him.

215
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,940
- Is this the scene?
- No.

216
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,240
The killer cut him in here...

217
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,140
strangle him up and let him
bleeding like a stuck pig.

218
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,740
Then he dragged him back in there,
cleaned him up...

219
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,540
...and sat him on the throne
for a dramatic effect.

220
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,940
- I gotta have some air.
- You welcome.

221
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,140
- Any witnesses?
- No.

222
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,140
What? No witnesses?
No witnesses?

223
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,202
- Are you kidding me?
- We talked to everyone in the building...

224
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:13,540
...no one saw anything.
No one heard anything.

225
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,302
Wait a minute! You kidding me.
A guy gets in here...

226
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:17,824
...cuts another guy's head off...

227
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,643
...walked out with it
and nobody sees anything?

228
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,664
No witnesses! Fuck!

229
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,340
I swear to God, man. I've
been on the job for 8 years...

230
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,640
...I never seen anythin'
like this. Never!

231
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,140
- He want to shock us.
- He's doin' a good job.

232
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,240
Let's go.

233
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,940
We found the victim's wallet.
Driver license id him as James Ordway.

234
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,897
Are we sure is him?

235
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:48,276
Yeah. We check the prints
against the license. It's him.

236
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:51,240
Leesan was killed 2 weeks ago,
Balcour one week ago...

237
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,440
- Ordway, last night.
- He's getting up to speed.

238
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,140
I have the lab download
his licence photo.

239
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,940
2427...

240
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,440
119...

241
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,560
Numbers...
1 plus 1 plus 9. 2.

242
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:39,818
2 plus 4...

243
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:55,140
4 plus 2 plus 7...

244
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,923
5... Doesn't make sense.
Doesn't make sense.

245
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:21,582
Peter, 119...
119...

246
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:28,871
Peter 1:19...

247
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,040
My God! Peter 1:19...

248
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,440
Mathew 24:27...

249
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,140
Peter, Matthew, James,
All names of apostles.

250
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,940
Peter was a fisherman. Balcour
owned a fishing fleet.

251
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,640
Mathew was a tax collector.
Leesan worked for the I.R.S.

252
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,140
So the guy is some kind
of a zealot?

253
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,540
The numbers he carved on the victims
are chapters and verses of the Bible.

254
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,140
Peter, chapter 1, verse 19.
119.

255
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,040
"But with precious blood
as of a lamb...

256
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,540
...unblemished and
unspotted. Christ...

257
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,140
...a message was written
in lamb's blood. "

258
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,940
Matthew, 24:27.

259
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,740
"For as the lightning cometh out of the
east, and shineth even unto the west.

260
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,540
so shall also the coming
of the Son of man. "

261
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,240
All the victims were 33 years old.
The same age as Christ...

262
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:34,640
...when he died.

263
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,440
All three died a week
apart of each other...

264
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,640
...on a friday, the same
day as Christ died.

265
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,440
The guy is been building
the body of Christ.

266
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,040
You said he's actually
rebuilding a body?

267
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,974
Yes. He's killing a person a week
for the last 3 weeks.

268
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:49,924
He's half way through.

269
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,740
If he stays right on his friday schedule,
that all take 3 more weeks.

270
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,640
- What's 3 weeks from now?
- Eastern.

271
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,640
The resurrection.

272
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Scolfield, you and Rousch
contact...

273
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,940
...every seminar, school
and church in the area.

274
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:09,140
Check on zealots,
disturbed personalities...

275
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,940
Anyone who might fill the profile.

276
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,840
Moles, check the mental institutions...

277
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,140
- ... see if they ever treated anyone that could be our boy.
- Got it.

278
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,540
The rest can check the crime scenes again.
Somebody had to see somethin'!

279
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,740
Care for a beer later?

280
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,540
I can't, I promised Sara
go to the market...

281
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,840
...so the house is stuffed
when Jenny comes in.

282
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,240
What's the story with this Jenny?
Is she cute?

283
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,340
I guess so.

284
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,940
You guess so? She's cute.
She's cute, right?.

285
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,305
OK, what's the problem?
You know I'm cute.

286
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,940
Can we make a little connection here?
You'll hooked us up?

287
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,940
I don't know... Last all I need is for her start
liking you and I've to see her longer.

288
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,240
No, no. That's good.
She likes me, she can stay with me.

289
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,440
It's all good. We all win.

290
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,540
Are you really that desperate?

291
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,808
Yeah. I'm really am.

292
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,940
Father Rousell dropped by
to see how you're doing.

293
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,940
- Good to see you, John?
- What brings you by, Father?

294
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Well, it's been 6 months
since you've been to church.

295
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,340
I just want to see how you doing.

296
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,240
I'm fine.

297
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,340
Will you sit down.
I just get's some coffee.

298
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,440
I'm just fine.

299
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,740
You shouldn't turn your
back on your faith.

300
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,540
God loves you, John.

301
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,640
His love can help you heal.

302
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Oh, I've seen how he loves me.

303
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,640
My son was in a coma
for 5 days.

304
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,240
You know how many times I prayed?

305
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,340
Where was God when
I needed him?

306
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:37,640
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright... It's alright.

307
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,340
What the hell where
you thinking, Sara?

308
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,540
I can't reach you anymore.

309
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,940
I'm right here.

310
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,640
I'm worried about you.

311
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,340
I'm worried about us.

312
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,140
What do you want from me?

313
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,840
I want you to talk to me.

314
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Will you please just
talk to me!

315
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,540
It's been 1 year
since Michael died...

316
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,240
...and you have not visited
his grave since the funeral.

317
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,540
You don't understand.

318
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,440
You are not the only
one who lost a child!

319
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,140
I'm sorry...

320
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,640
I'm sorry...

321
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,440
I'm so sorry.

322
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,540
I didn't mean that.

323
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,740
- Morning, John.
- Good morning.

324
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,740
So he says: we finally get back
together and she got hit by a bus..

325
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,540
This isn't a joke?

326
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,340
No. My cousin's girlfriend
got hit by a bus last night.

327
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,740
I'm sorry. How is she doing?

328
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,640
She's got a broken leg.

329
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,640
- Smooth, John, smooth.
- I though it was a joke.

330
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,140
What so funny?

331
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,105
- You have to be there.
- What do you got?

332
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,340
Since your press conference last night
we received about 50 calls...

333
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,140
...we've got people accusing everyone
from their mother in law to the mayor.

334
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:51,940
Well the mayor might not
a bad lead.

335
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,040
I got someone in my office you
guys should talk to.

336
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
- Who is he?
- FBI profiler.

337
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,505
- C'mon, Jack...
- OK, he's trying to help.

338
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,340
- Alright? This guy solved a lot of cases.
- What is he gonna tell me?

339
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,840
I'm looking for a white male...

340
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,940
- ... 25 to 45 years old?
- Just talk to him!

341
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,140
Prudhomme, Hollinsworth,
agent Wingate.

342
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:14,740
Nice to meet you.

343
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,640
I understand you might
have something for us.

344
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,040
Well, I though maybe
I can help...

345
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,140
...although I never come
across a serial killer which moved...

346
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,740
...in such accelerated paced.

347
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,940
How do you know what pace
he's moving at?

348
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,440
Your captain let me
look through your files.

349
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
Did he?

350
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,340
Based on what I've seen so far, you look
for someone above average intelligence.

351
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,240
White male, 25 to 45 years old...

352
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,540
Something funny?

353
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,640
- No, no. Go on.
- I'm sorry.

354
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,240
He'll be middle class,
a loner, not married.

355
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,340
Those who know him will
find him aloof but cordial.

356
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,040
Although he prefers isolation,
he has the ability to navigate...

357
00:29:56,075 --> 00:29:57,240
...in social settings when he has to.

358
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,840
He will have strong moral
and religious convictions.

359
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,540
Obviously his moral convictions
don't include murder.

360
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,740
He doesn't view what he's
doing as murder.

361
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
To him, he's making
sacrifices to God.

362
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,840
What point is there in keeping his
victim concious when he mutilates them?

363
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,240
Christ suffers on the cross.

364
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,077
He wants his victims to suffer.

365
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:20,005
But leaving clues behind
put him at risk.

366
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,440
He want us to know what he's doin'.

367
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,205
True. But there's more
to him than that.

368
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,202
If he merely wants you
to know what he's doing...

369
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,203
...there're more direct ways to inform you.

370
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,040
The clues he leaves give
him a sense of power.

371
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,740
And show he's in control.

372
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,840
Prudhomme, this fax just came in for you.
I think you should take a look at it.

373
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,240
You've heard the voice of the prophet
as he prepares the throne of grace...

374
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,540
...and you've twisted his message.

375
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,740
Those who died, do so
for the glory of God.

376
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,440
Spread the true gospel
before the end...

377
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:58,440
of the Boanerges, or you should
be judge by me.

378
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,240
What makes you think this is him?

379
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,140
Read the bottom.

380
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,040
So you do not doubt... Inside
the third one was the key to the mount.

381
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,940
May I? Third one?

382
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,940
Ordway.

383
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,340
Ordway, John...

384
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,140
Come in.

385
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,040
where's Ordway's body?

386
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,040
I just finished the autopsy.
I'm making out the report now...

387
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,940
...you can have it in... You can
have it by this afternoon.

388
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,940
- Anything unusual?
- No. Not really.

389
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,640
Except that all he's been
eating was olives.

390
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,940
The stomach was full of them.

391
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,940
- Mount of olives.
- It's him.

392
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,540
See ya.

393
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,640
This guy is fucking with us.

394
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,123
He likes you to know his word
so you can publicises his work.

395
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:50,507
He knows you know what
he's doin'

396
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,640
You failure to aknowledge him
just anger him.

397
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,140
So he's going to kill again tomorrow
and there's nothin' we can do to stop him.

398
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,240
Can you run a search through
your database...

399
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,105
...and see if you have anything
similar on file?

400
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,340
No problem. This my direct
line at the Bureau...

401
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,340
...and my cell phone number
will be at the back.

402
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,840
Call is it anything I can do.

403
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,540
Thank you.

404
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,705
They already got a name for him.

405
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,040
It sells papers.

406
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,340
What do you think makes
a man this crazy?

407
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:43,265
Who knows.

408
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,140
Problems goin' up,
pressures grew...

409
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,440
One day it start to slip
through the cracks.

410
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,940
And there's no one there
to catch you.

411
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,540
Happens every day.

412
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,440
I tell you one thing for sure,
I feeling a hell of a lot better...

413
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,540
knowing that he's drooling out
himself in a petty cell somewhere.

414
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,740
You're assuming we're
gonna catch him?

415
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,540
What the hell that
supossed to mean?

416
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,940
Assuming we're
gonna catch him?

417
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,540
It means that either we catching or
hell finished what his doin'...

418
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:15,040
...and dissapear like Jack,
the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer.

419
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,640
Or, come Eastern, he realizes all
he has is a rottin' corpse in his garage...

420
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,640
So he figure fucked up
this little respite...

421
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,940
...and start all over
again for next year.

422
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,340
I don't know if he really believes
he's creating the second coming.

423
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,640
I think is more simbolic.

424
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,940
He's sending a message.

425
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,140
- Yeah? To whom?
- To us. The world.

426
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,840
The guy is a fucking nutcase!

427
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,240
All this religious mambo jumbo
is bullshit!

428
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,612
You don't think the guy is at home
right now, reading this headlines...

429
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,451
...and jerking himself off?
He loves the attention...

430
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:46,107
He wants the attention!

431
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,340
I'm not doubting he's insane.

432
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,540
But don't discount his intelligence.

433
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,640
You think you just go out
and you find a 33 year old guy...

434
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,340
...named Peter. Who happens
to be a fisherman?

435
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,340
Or someone named Matthew
who is a tax collector?

436
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,740
Don't you see planning
that's got into this? The time.

437
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,147
Stop admiring him. He kills people.
Let's hear what you say of that.

438
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,040
I admire the intellect,
not the action.

439
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,340
Do you know how difficult
it is to get away with murder?

440
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,940
There're over a 50 ways
to fuck up a crime.

441
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,540
And if you can think of 20
of 'em you're a genius.

442
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,540
So far, this guy is adding
a thousand.

443
00:34:55,427 --> 00:35:02,680
...just to find thy words...
... the faith of the son of God...

444
00:35:02,681 --> 00:35:09,548
Spread the true gospel before
the end of the... Boanerges...

445
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:13,694
You shall be judge by him.

446
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,240
Boanerges...

447
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,240
From the greek, sons of thunder...

448
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:25,840
...an epitet used by Jesus.

449
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:31,540
Sons of thunder...
Seems to be 2 people or more.

450
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,440
Who is it?

451
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,140
John Prudhomme!

452
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,405
- John, is very latee.
- I'm sorry, father.

453
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,640
I need to talk to you,
is important.

454
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:21,640
- Come in.
- Thanks.

455
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,040
Is everything alright?

456
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,040
Yeah. I need some information
on the... Bonaerges.

457
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,540
- The what?
- The Boa-ner-ges.

458
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,440
Oh, is pronounced Boa-ner-ges.

459
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,240
Yeah, whatever. I... I know it
means sons of thunder.

460
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,140
Who's sons?

461
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,240
- Zebedee.
- Who is he?

462
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,540
He's only mention in the Bible
in relation to his sons.

463
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,340
- Yeah, where in the Bible?
- You should know this...

464
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,040
listen father, I don't have time
for a Bible class right now.

465
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,440
well, come with me.

466
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,040
Here it is...

467
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,340
Mark, 3:17.

468
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,505
James sons of Zebedee
and John, the brother of James...

469
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,740
...and he surname them the Boanerges...
Which is the sons of thunder.

470
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,640
John, the brother of James?

471
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,040
Yes.

472
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,540
Thank you, father.

473
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,640
Ordway has a brother.
His name is John.

474
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,340
He's going to be the fourth victim.
I need an address, fast. Thanks.

475
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,040
John Ordway, fotographer
has a work studio...

476
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,092
- at 1432, Baker Street.
- Home address?

477
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,121
The Baker's studio is
his home address.

478
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:52,376
Ok, I'm ten minutes away...

479
00:37:52,426 --> 00:37:55,040
Call him and tell him to lock himself in.
And wait for me.

480
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:56,540
I'll meet you there.

481
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,240
I talked to him and told
him to lock himself in.

482
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Call for backup and
check the perimeter.

483
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,640
Detective Hollinsworth requesting
backup at 1432, Baker Street.

484
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,940
Hang on! Hang on!

485
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,640
Oh God! Hang on!

486
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,340
Hang on!

487
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:01,826
Oh my God!

488
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,340
God!

489
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,740
I think he's still here...

490
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,240
He's here! He's here!

491
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,540
- Are you ok?
- He fucking got by me!

492
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,140
Where did he go?

493
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,240
Let's split out.

494
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,607
- I want a 10 blocks perimeter set.
- I'm on it.

495
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:03,707
Close the roof!

496
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,640
You two take the alley,
We'll take the street!

497
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,640
Freeze!

498
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,940
Put your hands on your head!

499
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,340
He's got a gun!

500
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,440
Drop the weapon!
Drop the weapon, now!

501
00:45:22,173 --> 00:45:23,936
Put it down!

502
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:26,668
Drop it and put up
your hands rigth now!

503
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,640
Don't shoot!

504
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,540
No! No! No!

505
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,740
Shit!

506
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,040
The gun was taped to his fucking hand!

507
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,754
No!

508
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,040
Get an ambulance!
Get an ambulance!

509
00:45:52,353 --> 00:45:54,965
Take it easy!
God!

510
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,040
No! Oh, no!

511
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,640
I can't... I can't feel my leg.

512
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,891
- I can't feel my leg!
- Can't you give him something?

513
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:08,243
- I did. It doesn't seem to work!
- I cam see my leg!

514
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,640
- Can you see my leg?
- Hold on!

515
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,240
We'll be at the hospital
in few minutes.

516
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,540
Andy, 2 boys are sharing
in a hospital room...

517
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:23,440
...so, one boy ask the other
why did he stayed for...

518
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,840
...so the boy says: circumcision..

519
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:31,240
The other boy says: Oh man,
I'd that done right after I was born...

520
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,340
...and I couldn't walk for a year.

521
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,040
It was... It was the fucking worst
joke I'd ever heard, John.

522
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,840
I know.

523
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,240
- Hello, Jack.
- Sara.

524
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,340
- How is he?
- We don't know yet.

525
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,940
Bone is completely shattered.

526
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,040
We stopped the bleeding,
but we'll have to ampute it.

527
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,140
It has to be something
else you can do.

528
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,640
If it was, detective,
I'll be doing it.

529
00:47:35,095 --> 00:47:37,473
- Hey.
- Hey.

530
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:41,539
- How you doin'?
- I'm okay.

531
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,340
They wanna take my leg.
They wanna take my leg.

532
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,440
I know.

533
00:47:50,145 --> 00:47:51,387
Don't let 'em take my leg.

534
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,340
Please, don't let 'em take my leg.

535
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,653
John, please, don't let them
take my leg!.

536
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,440
I'm scared. I'm scared.

537
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,040
I'm... I'm scared!

538
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,640
What the hell is he doing?

539
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:52,140
It's a... An old cajun superstition.

540
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,240
When someone suffer,
you put a knife under the bed...

541
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,840
It cuts the pain in half.

542
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,840
What are you doing here?

543
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,440
I'm working.

544
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,740
John, go home. Get some rest.

545
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,340
I'm not tired.

546
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,040
In my office.

547
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,840
John, I want you to
take a few days off.

548
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,640
We can't waste anymore time.

549
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,740
That's really how you see it?
Isn't it?

550
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,640
If you not here, the rest of us it
just ploughing alone in the dark.

551
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,340
- I dind't...
- You seeing those guys up there?

552
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,640
Those are detectives.

553
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,140
They do the same
job as you.

554
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,740
I know that.

555
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,040
I also know we
had him last night.

556
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:01,840
He was standing in the
same room with me. And got away.

557
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,340
Don't take me out of this, Jack.

558
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,040
Alright.

559
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,240
Thanks.

560
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,440
What do you think he's gonna do?
I mean, you interrupted him last night.

561
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,140
He didn't get what he came for.

562
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,240
If he wants to stay
on schedule for Eastern...

563
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,940
He's gonna have to
make up for lost time.

564
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,840
So do you.

565
00:50:29,347 --> 00:50:30,261
John.

566
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,740
- We just want you to know that...
- Thanks guys.

567
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,924
Thank you.

568
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,640
There's a Dr. Nestler
on line one for you.

569
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,184
- Hi, doctor.
- We've a problem over here...

570
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:00,944
...that I think you
should know about it.

571
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:03,040
I though the operation
went fine.

572
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,540
It did.

573
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,340
I... I don't understand.

574
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,140
One of our ordelies was
found out unconcious down there.

575
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,640
Someone beat the hell out of him.

576
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,942
- I'll send an officer over.
- The police are already here.

577
00:51:15,943 --> 00:51:17,051
Detective...

578
00:51:17,101 --> 00:51:20,455
The orderly was carrying
an appendage dowstairs.

579
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,140
Somebody stole your partner's leg.

580
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Can I see him?

581
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,040
He's still pretty grounded.
Try not to be long.

582
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,340
Thanks.

583
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:00,166
I wanted to stop by
and see how you were doing.

584
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,340
You need anything?

585
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,940
Yeah. A leg.

586
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,340
You got one?

587
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,740
I'm sorry.

588
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,040
I'm so sorry.

589
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,240
Hey, you know... When I was
coming out of the alley...

590
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:31,640
I was... I was...
I can hear you screaming.

591
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:37,540
I just... I never imagined that
you were screaming at me.

592
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,240
I must being pretty out of it,
from the stunt gun.

593
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,440
I just get...

594
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,640
I just get moving towards
the sound of your voices.

595
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,740
I loved being a cop.

596
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,240
Is all I ever wanted to be.

597
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,640
For as far back I can remember.

598
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,140
A cop.
Helping people.

599
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
Righting wrongs.

600
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,640
You know what I mean?
That's the finest thing you can be.

601
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,538
Oh man... Oh man...

602
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,640
What I'm gonna do now, John?

603
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,440
What I'm gonna do now?

604
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,882
You can go, you know?
You can go.

605
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,040
I just want to be left
alone. Alright?

606
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,240
Go on. Go!

607
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,740
- Wingate.
- John Prudhomme.

608
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,040
Thank you.

609
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,640
You let him get inside your
head. You can't do that.

610
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,340
How am I do not that?.

611
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,840
You divorce yourself from
your emotions.

612
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,040
What?

613
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,140
Turn it off like a light switch?

614
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,440
Right now, there is a cop...

615
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,440
a friend...

616
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,140
Who will never be the same
because of me.

617
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,947
You're doing exactly
what he wants you to do.

618
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:42,993
You're concentrating in your guilt.

619
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,940
I got my fucking partner
shot last night!

620
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,640
What the fuck at you
looking at?

621
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,540
How can I help you,
Prudhomme?

622
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,740
I assumed there are others
you can talk to...

623
00:54:57,775 --> 00:55:00,940
- Or you just wanted to vent.
- Sorry.

624
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:06,840
I think last night was my best shot
at catching this guy and I fucked it up.

625
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,940
I don't know where
to go from here.

626
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,140
If you can't go fowards,
go backwards.

627
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,940
Back up. Who is he?
What do you know about him?

628
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,240
He wants to kill?

629
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,240
I mean, he's insane.

630
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,840
I've spent years studying
these guys. Divulging their excuses...

631
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,640
Fathers who beat them,
mothers who raped them...

632
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,240
Voices tell them what to do...

633
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,840
The bottom line is,
except for a very small percentage...

634
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,940
...they all know
they commited murder.

635
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,240
He thinks he's rebuilding the body
of Christ. If that is not insane!

636
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,140
His actions don't define
his state of mind.

637
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,340
Look at Dhammer,
Casey, Bundy...

638
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,440
They all commited horrible
acts. But they were sane.

639
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,440
The fact that he's careful
not to leave any evidence behind...

640
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,240
.. shows he's aware the're
consequences to his actions.

641
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,640
Look...

642
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,340
I don't care if he's sane or not...

643
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,440
I just wanna catch him.

644
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,040
You couldn't catch a cold,
the way your thinking.

645
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:00,358
Thanks.

646
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,540
Stop focusing on
his state of mind.

647
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:07,340
Look for the pattern.
Whatever he thinks he's doing...

648
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,840
...or creating that's what
drives him to murder.

649
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,340
What is doing it doesn't as
much important as why is doing it.

650
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,640
If you can figure that out
it lead you to him.

651
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,540
- You really should eat.
- No, thanks.

652
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,440
This came for you
while you were out.

653
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,240
How is Hollinsworth doing?

654
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,940
- You didn't see him?
- Yeah, I'm saw him.

655
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,040
- Anything else?
- Nothing.

656
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,484
The computer give us a couple of names
that could be our boy, but...

657
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:47,040
...they're all in prison
or in the loony bin.

658
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:49,940
It would appear that I
underestimated you.

659
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,840
Sometimes, I'm too clever
for my own good.

660
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,640
It won't happen again.

661
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,840
You must admit there's a strange
irony in the last night events.

662
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,540
In the end,
I got what I wanted.

663
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:08,240
John would be better,
but Andrew was an apostle also.

664
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,940
I was hoping not to
make this personal...

665
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,573
I warned you that
you would be judged

666
00:57:13,623 --> 00:57:16,640
...if you did not tell the
world of my work.

667
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,141
Your lack of contrition...

668
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:21,239
...leave me no choice
but to punish you.

669
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,240
Your penitency shall be remorse.

670
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,140
Remorse for the dead
of your wife.

671
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,723
There's a unit in the area!

672
00:57:32,724 --> 00:57:34,579
Send them over, now!
Get out of the way!

673
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,340
- Sir, you have to stop right there!
- I live here!

674
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,940
- Believe me, you don't wanna go inside!
- Let me go!

675
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,640
John...

676
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,440
I'm taking care of this now.

677
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,971
You don't need to see this.

678
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:38,082
No. No. No!

679
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:41,004
John, c'mon. C'mon!

680
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,740
You don't need to be here.
Step outside.

681
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:50,922
No! No!

682
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,840
C'mon, John.
Step outside!

683
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,540
John, don't touch anything.

684
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,440
This is a crime scene.

685
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,240
Jenny!

686
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,340
Jenny.

687
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,340
I'm pulling you off this.
It's gone too far.

688
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,140
He came to my house...

689
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,040
To kill my wife.

690
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,440
Wich is why you're
off this thing.

691
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,440
It's personal, now.

692
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,540
You can't do this.

693
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:48,640
It's done. I'm giving it
to Rousch and Scolfield.

694
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,440
I'm went out to get
something special for dinner.

695
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,840
Jenny was tired for the trip.

696
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,040
We don't have to talk
about it now.

697
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,540
Why would someone do
such a thing?

698
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,140
It was him.

699
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,440
The guy who is killing
all these people.

700
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,940
He was trying to hurt me.

701
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,140
By killing Jenny?

702
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Oh, my God!
He was trying to kill me!

703
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,940
I though I'd lost you.

704
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:19,640
I want you to go stay with
your mother until this is over.

705
01:01:19,675 --> 01:01:20,840
But, John...

706
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,140
Sara, please...

707
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,237
Good evening...

708
01:01:34,238 --> 01:01:35,238
As it has been, our top story
tonight continues to be...

709
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,440
...the ongoing search
for a serial killer.

710
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:43,140
Chicago Police Department has
released part of a tape...

711
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,140
...sent to them by
the "Numbers Killer".

712
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:49,440
"It would appeared
I under estimated you...

713
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,540
Sometimes I'm too clever
for my own good...

714
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,440
It won't happened again".

715
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,840
Anyone who recognizes
this voice...

716
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,840
...is asked to contact the
Homicide Division...

717
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:01,840
...of the Chicago Police
Department.

718
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,766
In other news tonight,
Chicago City officials has released...

719
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,440
...last year crime statistics...

720
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,140
What's up?

721
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,040
A woman just called
from the Beaumont Hotel...

722
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
Says she recognizes the
voice in the tape.

723
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,840
I'm gonna want to take
a couple of guys with me.

724
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,040
Take whoever you need.

725
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:33,883
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

726
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:34,840
Scolfield.

727
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,340
Prudhomme...

728
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,440
He said whoever I need.

729
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,040
- I'm looking for Dolores Koons.
- Well, take a seat...?

730
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,040
Chief... This ain't
an interview, buddy.

731
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,540
4- D.

732
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,940
Nice smell in here.

733
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,240
It's like a goddammed letrine.

734
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,340
- Miss Koons?
- Yeah.

735
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,840
I'm Detective Rousch.
You called us?

736
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,740
Yeah. I sure did.

737
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,540
I was watching the news this
morning then I heard the tape.

738
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,840
I mean, as soon as I heard it
I thought to myself that's Mr. Bresler...

739
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,940
You know his first name?

740
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,940
Fisrt name? No.

741
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:56,540
I just always called
him Mr. Bresler.

742
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,540
He seems like a
very nice guy.

743
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,640
But I bet a lot of those serial
killers are like that. Huh?

744
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,040
You sure is his voice?

745
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,940
Yeah, enough to call.

746
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,840
Where we can find him?

747
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,640
Down the hall. 4-G

748
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,240
If is him? Do I like gain
anything?

749
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,740
Appreciation from the people
of Chicago.

750
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,240
Mr. Bresler, is the police.
Could you open the door, please.

751
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,640
Mr. Bresler, we'd like to talk to
you. Please, can we come in?

752
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,640
We're here because someone
thinks you might sent us a tape.

753
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,640
A tape...

754
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:23,040
Mr. Bresler, I'm gonna
read you a couple of sentences...

755
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,040
I apreciate if you repeat 'em
back to me.

756
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:29,340
It would appeared that I
under estimated you.

757
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,040
Sometimes I'm too clever
for my own good.

758
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:35,640
It would appeared that I
under estimated you.

759
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:39,540
Sometimes I'm too clever
for my own good.

760
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,740
It won't happened again.

761
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,840
You must admit there's a strange
irony in the last night events.

762
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:50,240
But in the end, I got
what I wanted it.

763
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:55,940
John would been better, but
Andrew was an apostle also.

764
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,840
Should I do the rest?

765
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,540
- He's not the guy.
- What? Did you hear his voice?

766
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,240
He made the tape...

767
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,540
...but he's not the guy
we're looking for.

768
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,240
His blind.

769
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,740
Mr. Bresler,
did you make the tape?

770
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,840
- Yes.
- Why?

771
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,940
- Someone paid me 50 dollars.
- Who? Do you know him?

772
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,340
Some guy I met
in the park.

773
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,040
Said he was working in
some kind of movie...

774
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:35,340
He was looking
for interesting voices.

775
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,740
I knew that was a lot
of bullshit...

776
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:41,040
But 50 bucks is 50 bucks.

777
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,540
Thanks.

778
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,340
He's smart. He talked to us
without using his voice...

779
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,440
The guy who made the tape
can't identify him.

780
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,240
I'm getting the feeling we
never gonna catch this guy.

781
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:02,640
They just found number 5.

782
01:07:55,568 --> 01:07:56,548
- Hey, John?
- Yeah.

783
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,040
You got change for a dollar?

784
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:12,440
Come with me.

785
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,040
What are we looking for?

786
01:08:17,815 --> 01:08:21,440
Peter Balcour had five
quarters in his pockets...

787
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,840
So did Leesan.
What about the others?

788
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,840
- James Ordway too.
- John Ordway also.

789
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:38,240
So did Wells. Five victims.
All with five quarters in their pockets.

790
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,540
No way that's a coincidence.

791
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,740
Wait...

792
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,340
To finish what he's doing
he needs six bodies.

793
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,740
Six bodies with five quarters
each is thirty quarters.

794
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,140
Thirty pieces of silver!

795
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:57,640
He thinks he's Judas?

796
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:02,340
No. He's letting un know
why he's doing this.

797
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,540
- He's atoning.
- John?

798
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,440
- Take a look at this.
- What is it?

799
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,340
Homicide report from Tennessee.

800
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,889
Two and a half years ago, a police
incursion found a 33 years old male...

801
01:09:13,939 --> 01:09:17,840
...with his head cut off.
Victim's name was Phillip Weir.

802
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,463
- He was an apostle.
- Yeah.

803
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:21,740
How did you get this?

804
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,540
- FBI computer spilled it out.
- Just now?

805
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:25,888
What do you mean just now?

806
01:09:25,938 --> 01:09:27,287
We call over Quantico
about three days ago.

807
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,866
But I asked Wingate
three weeks ago!

808
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,440
I'm detective Prudhomme.
I wanna see agent Wingate.

809
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,488
Agent Wingate is in
a meeting right now.

810
01:09:40,538 --> 01:09:43,804
I don't care what he's doing.
I wanna see him now!

811
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,640
I think you better
get out here.

812
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,440
Hava a seat, please.

813
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:53,840
No, thank you.
I don't wanna sit down.

814
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,840
I wanna see Wingate.

815
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,740
Is there a problem here?

816
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,540
What the fuck?

817
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,540
Yes there is a problem!

818
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,140
I wanna see agent Wingate!

819
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:08,140
I'm agent Wingate.

820
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,140
Didn't anybody check his I.D.?

821
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,578
Yes sir, they said
they saw it.

822
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:27,842
But look at to him...

823
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:30,357
Somebody this clever wouldn't
have any problem getting a card.

824
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,440
A badge you can find anywhere.

825
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,540
What about the office
number they gave us?

826
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:38,740
It was a message center,
rented by mail with a money order.

827
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,540
- Cell phone number?
- Clone..

828
01:10:41,872 --> 01:10:45,840
If we get a print and it's
on file, we'll id him.

829
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:51,940
We still have on thing
on our side.

830
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,040
He doesn't know we know it.

831
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,740
- Wingate.
- Prudhomme.

832
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,540
- How is it going?
- Good.

833
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:02,940
We may have find a few things
that might put us a little closer.

834
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,440
What things?

835
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,940
I want to run them by
you here, sometime.

836
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:12,840
- I'm kind of busy today...
- It only take about half hour.

837
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:17,540
I'll meet you in two hours
over that pizza place.

838
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,540
- Great, I apreciate it.
- no problem.

839
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,340
We got him.

840
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,240
- Are you guys ready?
- Ten-Four.

841
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:47,040
- Moltz?
- Roger.

842
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,740
He's here.

843
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,740
He's crossing the street.
Dark blue suit.

844
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:14,040
Got him.

845
01:12:21,155 --> 01:12:22,840
- Take him!
- Freeze!

846
01:12:23,103 --> 01:12:25,307
Put your hands over
your head. Now!

847
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:27,463
Put your hands on top
of your head!

848
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:31,405
Get down! Down!

849
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,740
Get on your fucking
knees, now!

850
01:12:35,741 --> 01:12:37,413
Get on your knees. Now!

851
01:12:51,386 --> 01:12:52,940
You have the right
to remain silent.

852
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,440
Anything you say can and will be use
against you in a court of law.

853
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,840
You have the right
to an attorney.

854
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,740
If you can't afford one
it would be too fucking bad.

855
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:04,040
Let's get this prick
into the fucking car.

856
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:15,240
It just a matter of time that your
prints tell us who you are.

857
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,740
Only if I have a
criminal record in Illinois...

858
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,540
Which I do not.

859
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,740
I'd like to know
why I'm here.

860
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,740
Because you murdered five people.

861
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,505
Really?

862
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:31,540
What, may I ask, is the evidence you
using to support this claim?

863
01:13:31,575 --> 01:13:34,740
Do you have any prints?
Any trace evidence? Physical evidence?

864
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:37,440
Witnesses? Motive?
Anything?

865
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:41,540
One thing that connects
me with these crimes?

866
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,540
You don't have to answer.
I already know. I've seen the files.

867
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:52,340
You think you really
clever, don't you?

868
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:56,740
Let's talk about the
clocksteel murder.

869
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:59,540
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

870
01:13:59,575 --> 01:14:02,340
Oh yes, you do.
You where there.

871
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,740
What was it a practice one?

872
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,940
Do you really think you're
doing God's work?

873
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:14,540
If God were to call
upon someone...

874
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,540
You really think he'd choose a
pathetic little whined like you?

875
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:23,340
Detective Prudhomme, I do believe
you're trying to provoke me.

876
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,340
- Listen to me...
- No! You listen to me.

877
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,740
I'm talking with you because it gives me
something to do before my attorney arrives.

878
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,940
The truth is I'll be out
of here in 48 hours.

879
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,162
You know it
and I know it...

880
01:14:35,163 --> 01:14:37,642
Of course, you and your
partner will follow me...

881
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,740
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot!
Your partner can't walk anymore...

882
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,240
- Since his leg was blown off.
- Shut up!

883
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,540
I'd imagine you carry a tremendous
amount of guilt for that.

884
01:14:45,575 --> 01:14:46,740
Shut your mouth!

885
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,840
He trusted you, but when he
run towards you for safety...

886
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,140
Prudhomme, outside.
Now!

887
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:01,840
I enjoyed our little
chat, detective. I truly did.

888
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,840
He's a cocky little prick,
isn't he?

889
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,840
He knows we've nothing.

890
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,640
He also knows the law.

891
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:20,540
If we don't get something in 48 hours,
we got to cut him loose.

892
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,340
I'm sorry about last week.

893
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,840
It wasn't your fault.

894
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,340
You know that.

895
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,040
It's okay.

896
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,040
They said you got him.
Who is he?

897
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:00,340
We don't know. We plastered
his face all over the news.

898
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,540
Hundreds of people are calling.

899
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,540
We feed the names
into the computer and a...

900
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,340
...wait for a print match.

901
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,440
- But it's him?
- It's him.

902
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:17,240
You cant let this
fucker walk, John.

903
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,540
I won't.

904
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,140
I won't.

905
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,440
Not guilty.

906
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,440
Bail?

907
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:30,740
Your honor, the State is
requesting the bail be denied.

908
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,340
On what grounds?

909
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,040
We do not know the
defender's true identity...

910
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,240
...therefore we cannot determine
his ties to the community.

911
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:41,940
We feel that the risk of
flight is great.

912
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,440
The fact that the police
cannot prove nor disprove...

913
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,540
...my client's identity is not
grounds to deny bail.

914
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,740
The truth is Mr. Wingate
has been held for nearly two days...

915
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,512
...on a probable cause
on another matter.

916
01:16:52,513 --> 01:16:54,537
Is this true, Mr. Galloway?

917
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,740
Yes, your honor... he is
considered the prime suspect...

918
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:01,440
...in regards to recent murders.

919
01:17:01,665 --> 01:17:03,451
I see no murder
charges before me...

920
01:17:03,501 --> 01:17:06,798
...the only charge I see is
impersonating a federal officer.

921
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,340
Bail is set at twenty
thousand dollars.

922
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,640
We'll have a ten minutes recess.
Gentleman, will you aproach the bench, please.

923
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,040
Mr. Galloway, what exactly do you
think you're doing out there?

924
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,940
Just stop a murder for
going free.

925
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,540
Therer are procedures for that.

926
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,840
As a distric attorney, I should not
have to tell you this.

927
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,540
I will not have this
courtroom used...

928
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,940
...for your own personal
agenda, Mr. Galloway.

929
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,740
Judge, my client is
ready to post bail...

930
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,505
I like to request his
inmediate release.

931
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:39,240
I'm still have six hours
left to hold him.

932
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,840
And I'm intent to use them.

933
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,940
Six hours, Mr. Galloway...

934
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,340
You are to file murder charges
or you'll release him.

935
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,640
Janice, what the...
I sent photos of a man!

936
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,140
Sex change operation.
Ok, thank you very much.

937
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,740
When was the last
time you saw him?

938
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:15,060
- 40 years ago!
- I'll check on it. Thanks.

939
01:18:16,087 --> 01:18:17,940
- The killings in Tennessee?
- Ask him how far is from Clarksdale.

940
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,940
Ma'am, how far are you
for Clarksdale?

941
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,940
- 20 miles.
- Ma'am I need you to...

942
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:29,135
Gerald Demus.
Pass it through...

943
01:18:29,136 --> 01:18:31,799
FBI, Tenesse Police
and the DMV.

944
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,340
No, thank you.
I'll be going out for lunch today.

945
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,240
I just got out the phone
with the Social Service Department...

946
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:50,140
They have no record of
a Gerald Demus.

947
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,790
You try the neighbors in town?

948
01:18:51,825 --> 01:18:53,340
We're on it now.

949
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,540
I'm here for Greg Wingate.

950
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,552
- Yeah?
- Delwey's here to pick up Wingate.

951
01:19:04,587 --> 01:19:07,040
- What? Stall him!
- How?

952
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,040
I don't know!
Think on something.

953
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:15,540
We're having troubles
finding the paperwork.

954
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:22,340
- City Court.
- Judge Seers, please.

955
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:26,840
Prudhomme, what the
hell do you think you're doin'?

956
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,991
Wingate was supposed to
be released 15 minutes ago.

957
01:19:29,245 --> 01:19:30,633
Re-cause him.

958
01:19:30,668 --> 01:19:32,540
You got something you
can give right now?

959
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:35,240
- No.
- Then kick him loose.

960
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:37,930
I need a little more time.

961
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,176
We think we know who he is.
And if he is...

962
01:19:40,211 --> 01:19:43,940
He lives 20 miles for
an identical murder 2 years ago!

963
01:19:43,975 --> 01:19:45,740
We don't have any
more time.

964
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,840
I just got a
call from Judge Seers.

965
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:50,940
She issued the riff
for his inmediate release.

966
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,740
Thanks a lot.

967
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,140
You're out of here.

968
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,320
I want you on him
the minute he walks out the door.

969
01:20:01,355 --> 01:20:04,053
If he takes a shit, I wanna know
how many times he wipe his ass.

970
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,979
- Sign here.
- Here?

971
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,740
Thanks.

972
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,940
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

973
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,040
Taxi.

974
01:20:41,256 --> 01:20:42,975
He is in Sixth and Blanche.

975
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,540
He heads for the
train station.

976
01:20:50,575 --> 01:20:51,540
Go.

977
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:01,940
Sheriff in Tennessee
says he arrested...

978
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,440
...Gerald Demus 5 years ago
for attacking a town minister.

979
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:07,940
- Prints are on their way over.
- Get that out.

980
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,540
- You think he's leaving?
- No.

981
01:21:43,575 --> 01:21:45,540
He's not finished yet.

982
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,740
Yeah. Prints are in. Lab's working
on them now.

983
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,274
Can't you do this faster?

984
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:52,522
Yes. We got a match.
Take him.

985
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:11,106
Demus? This is the police.

986
01:24:11,107 --> 01:24:14,040
Stand up and
open the door slowly.

987
01:24:14,075 --> 01:24:16,040
Dot it now!

988
01:24:24,602 --> 01:24:26,699
Shit!
Fuck!

989
01:24:26,726 --> 01:24:31,073
What? Everyone moving.
I want this place closed down. Now!

990
01:24:33,397 --> 01:24:35,683
- Seal the door.
- Got it.

991
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:39,562
Hold it, please. No one must
leave. This is a police emergency.

992
01:24:58,197 --> 01:25:00,096
Shit!

993
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,793
Hey! Sorry.

994
01:25:36,874 --> 01:25:42,940
Hey! Hey you!
Hey you, stop!

995
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:49,890
Get down! Get down!

996
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:53,940
Get down!

997
01:26:03,524 --> 01:26:05,540
Get out of my way!

998
01:26:05,646 --> 01:26:07,140
Freeze!

999
01:26:10,677 --> 01:26:12,540
Demus!

1000
01:26:15,028 --> 01:26:16,940
Motherfucker!

1001
01:26:20,435 --> 01:26:22,140
Freeze!

1002
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:25,162
Motherfucker!
Get out of the way!

1003
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:50,940
I losted him.
Shit!

1004
01:26:57,234 --> 01:27:02,340
5 years ago, Demus attacks
the local minister in Windsfield.

1005
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,954
The minister refuses to
press charges...

1006
01:27:04,955 --> 01:27:06,523
So they kick him loose.

1007
01:27:06,990 --> 01:27:08,761
But he's still arrested.

1008
01:27:08,796 --> 01:27:10,790
What else were his prints
in the system?

1009
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:12,677
Woodsville is a small department.

1010
01:27:12,712 --> 01:27:16,640
They only came online with
the Tenesse database 3 years ago.

1011
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:19,799
Even then, they only have
recent arrest into the system.

1012
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,053
Hundreds of millions
of dollars in computers...

1013
01:27:22,088 --> 01:27:24,232
...and we id the guy
because some old lady...

1014
01:27:24,267 --> 01:27:27,028
...in Willingstone, Tenesse,
watched him on TV?

1015
01:27:27,063 --> 01:27:27,885
Incredible!

1016
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,153
Two and a half years later,
Demus kills Phillip Weir.

1017
01:27:31,188 --> 01:27:32,390
Why'd he stopped?

1018
01:27:32,425 --> 01:27:36,636
Because 2 weeks after the murder
he was picked up in Tulsa.

1019
01:27:36,671 --> 01:27:39,419
Wandering the streets.
Talking to the pidgeons.

1020
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:44,042
He spent the next 2 years
in the state mental hospital.

1021
01:27:44,077 --> 01:27:47,540
They just released him
6 months ago.

1022
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,740
Why he didn't stay in Tulsa?

1023
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:56,781
The media wants to
pass the status, ok?

1024
01:28:57,124 --> 01:28:58,736
Scolfield...

1025
01:28:59,565 --> 01:29:01,159
Wellcome.

1026
01:29:01,871 --> 01:29:04,206
Thomas Heckert, 33.

1027
01:29:04,241 --> 01:29:07,863
That's the boyfriend, works the
graveyard in the Memorial Medical Center.

1028
01:29:07,898 --> 01:29:10,077
Found him this morning
when he came from work.

1029
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:13,803
- How long he's been dead?
- A few hours.

1030
01:29:13,838 --> 01:29:18,940
He took the torso.
Left the legs, the arms and the head.

1031
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,762
You think this is
the end of it?

1032
01:29:24,927 --> 01:29:26,322
I hope so.

1033
01:29:26,724 --> 01:29:29,074
This thing have to happen.

1034
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,976
All you had to do was
hold him a little longer.

1035
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:33,428
Don't lay this at my door!

1036
01:29:33,429 --> 01:29:35,826
This man is still be alive
if your guys didn't loose him!

1037
01:29:35,827 --> 01:29:38,328
- Yeah, right.
- Fuck off!

1038
01:29:40,534 --> 01:29:42,265
You've seen this?

1039
01:29:42,465 --> 01:29:45,508
They running a pictorial
of the crime scenes.

1040
01:29:45,888 --> 01:29:48,978
Jesus! Next thing, they'll
be giving tours.

1041
01:29:55,210 --> 01:29:57,148
This isn't right.

1042
01:29:57,265 --> 01:29:59,947
- What isn't right?
- This photo.

1043
01:30:00,026 --> 01:30:04,740
When we sealed the crime scene,
all the windows and shutters were closed.

1044
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:07,403
Look at the upstairs window.
It's open.

1045
01:30:07,604 --> 01:30:09,888
Where's the best place to hide?

1046
01:30:10,092 --> 01:30:12,093
Somewhere we already looked.

1047
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:27,529
Go upstairs.

1048
01:30:35,527 --> 01:30:38,267
Go, go! Move.
Move! Go!

1049
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,694
Clear!

1050
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:13,340
Sweet mother of God!

1051
01:31:13,344 --> 01:31:14,875
Prudhomme?

1052
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,340
You better get in here.

1053
01:32:06,814 --> 01:32:08,340
Shit!

1054
01:32:20,047 --> 01:32:23,640
Prudhomme,
check this out upstairs.

1055
01:32:42,061 --> 01:32:45,740
Behold the glory of God!

1056
01:32:46,047 --> 01:32:48,681
Sinners, take it!

1057
01:32:48,821 --> 01:32:53,200
Soon, the hand of judgement
shall be upon ye.

1058
01:32:55,683 --> 01:32:58,134
Motherfucker...

1059
01:33:41,323 --> 01:33:44,294
Alright. We leave a team here
in case he comes back.

1060
01:33:44,329 --> 01:33:46,509
He'll be back...

1061
01:33:46,544 --> 01:33:49,612
Twelve apostles
should be dead...

1062
01:33:49,647 --> 01:33:52,069
Look at the spreaders,
he used 'em to open the chest.

1063
01:33:52,104 --> 01:33:54,457
Don't even tell me that.

1064
01:33:54,492 --> 01:33:57,551
Yes. He's going after a heart.

1065
01:33:57,552 --> 01:33:59,634
Tomorrow is Easter...

1066
01:33:59,815 --> 01:34:01,532
We need to search every hospital...

1067
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:07,131
We looking for a woman who gives
birth to his son after midnight.

1068
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:10,195
- You know how many hospitals...
- Her name would be Mary.

1069
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:19,608
I got a Mary at St. Paul.
She's in labor now.

1070
01:34:19,643 --> 01:34:20,996
Girl or boy?

1071
01:34:21,031 --> 01:34:23,776
I don't know. The parents didn't
want to know the results of the ultrasound.

1072
01:34:23,811 --> 01:34:26,177
You and Scolfield go
to see that one.

1073
01:34:32,196 --> 01:34:33,519
Thanks.

1074
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,786
- I got it!
- What?

1075
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:37,288
Oak Park Memorial
has Mary Dominguez...

1076
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,741
- She just gave birth to a boy.
- Let's go!

1077
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,640
God!

1078
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,135
Hold it! C'mon!

1079
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:10,240
- You're okay?
- Shit! Yeah. Go, go!

1080
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:12,829
- Call for backup!
- Go, go, go!

1081
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:03,040
It's over.
Give me the baby.

1082
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,040
No! No!

1083
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,440
It's called instinct.
For him to cry, isn't it?

1084
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,440
Put down the gun.

1085
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,640
Put it down!

1086
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:21,140
Okay.

1087
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:28,840
I'd imagine this is a painful situation,
you'd already loose one child.

1088
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:33,140
It's over. We've been inside
the house and dump the body.

1089
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:36,040
Sacrilege! It's a sacrilege!

1090
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:39,940
You're nothing now.
Nothing but another lunatic.

1091
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:43,540
One year form now, no one
will even remembered you name.

1092
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,640
- If I'll drop this child they will.
- No!

1093
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:49,940
It's my last offer.

1094
01:37:49,941 --> 01:37:51,616
No! No!

1095
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,540
It's time for us to die.

1096
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,740
Motherfucker!

1097
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:37,140
- Here you are Mr. Prudhomme.
- Thank you.

1098
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,840
- Are you alright?
- Yes

1099
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:47,540
John, the baby's parents
would like to thank you.

1100
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,040
- Thank you for the life of my son.
- I'm glad he's alright.

1101
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,240
Please, take this.

1102
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,340
Thank you.

1103
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:14,140
I spoke to the doctor...

1104
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,640
You're gonna be out of
the field for at least 3 months.

1105
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:20,240
Its not important.
I need some time...

1106
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:24,240
I need to pick up some
of the pieces in my life.

1107
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:28,640
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1108
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:44,240
Hey man, come on in.
This is time for a test drive.

1109
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:47,940
- You look good, Andy.
- You're mad? I'm terrible.

1110
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:52,840
I met a guy who runs the Boston
marathon with one of this things.

1111
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:54,440
When are you
coming back to work?

1112
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:58,440
I'm coming back. Don't get
me worng, John. I'm comin' back.

1113
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:01,940
I'm comin' back but no sit
around one damm desk, either.

1114
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,440
Guys skiing with this things,
you know?

1115
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:06,340
Fuck.

1116
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,540
- Let me help.
- I'm ok, John.

1117
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,640
Listen, seriously...

1118
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:16,540
If this is gonna work for real,
you gotta gimme a chance, alright?

1119
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,082
You gotta gimme
a chance to come back.

1120
01:40:18,132 --> 01:40:21,057
I'll be good as new.
But you gotta gimme a chance.

1121
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:25,940
You may have to pickup
a fair share at the legwork.

1122
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:27,540
But I will be back.

1123
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:29,999
Whatever you say, partner.
