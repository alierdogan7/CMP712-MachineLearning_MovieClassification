00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:59,050
Thank youfor your cooperation.

186
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:00,714
Go.

187
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:05,626
Put your hands up, please, sir.

188
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,922
What?

189
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:09,260
Could you get your hands up,
please?

190
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,733
[Beeping]

191
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,970
There are no weapons
allowed on board, sir.

192
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,144
My own recipe.

193
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:27,841
Way more dangerous.

194
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:36,021
ELGYN: Nice welcome, Perez.
What the hell is this?

195
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:39,618
Are you afraid the six of us
are gonna hijack your damn ship?

196
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:41,128
Just a minor concern...

197
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:43,153
that one of your asshole
crew members...

198
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:45,894
will get drunk and put
a bullet through the hull.

199
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,164
We happen to be in space, Elgyn.

200
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:50,763
No shit. How you been?

201
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,199
[Beeping]

202
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:01,209
Want to check the chair?

203
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:10,408
Elgyn, these were
very, very hard to come by.

204
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:12,504
So was our cargo.

205
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:16,415
You're not about to plead
poverty on me, are you, General?

206
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:17,748
No. I'm just saying...

207
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:20,084
very few people
deal in cash nowadays.

208
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:23,057
Just the ones don't like
to keep business records.

209
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:24,683
Yourself, for example.

210
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:25,750
Drink, Elgyn?

211
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,125
Constantly.

212
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:35,035
ELGYN: Now, I'm gonna take
a wild guess here, General...

213
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,097
but I'm thinking whatever
you got going on here...

214
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:43,601
it ain't exactly
approved by Congress.

215
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:49,083
Who's the new filly
you got on board, Elgyn?

216
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:53,110
Call?
Little girl playing pirates.

217
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:55,783
She makes an impression.

218
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:58,622
She is severely fuckable,
ain't she?

219
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,628
Ha ha ha!

220
00:19:00,662 --> 00:19:02,323
Mind you...

221
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:04,559
I think she's just
a tad curious...

222
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,067
about this little
transaction of ours.

223
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,570
I mean,
I can't say as I blame her.

224
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:11,572
It's awfully
cloak-and-dagger stuff.

225
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:14,234
It's a military operation.

226
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:17,370
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:20,279
ELGYN: Correct me if I'm wrong,
but, uh...

228
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:24,115
I was under the impression
that most army medical labs...

229
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:27,178
don't have to operate
outside of regulated space.

230
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:28,655
What do you want, Elgyn?

231
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,750
- Me?
- Yeah.

232
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:33,988
Two days bed and board.

233
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:37,123
Vriess might wanna
snag a part here or there.

234
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:39,190
Whatever. If it's not imposing.

235
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,964
Mi casa es su casa.

236
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,721
FATHER: Please direct cargo
to med lab center, area "G."

237
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:11,630
Follow the lit path.

238
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,657
Do not deviate.

239
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,148
FATHER: Cargo status... stable.

240
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,651
Life forms intact.

241
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:33,711
Stasis uninterrupted.

242
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,660
FATHER: Med lab center
is off-limits to civilians.

243
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:51,694
Thank you.

244
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:49,094
Aah! Aah! Aah!

245
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,368
JOHNER: Oh.

246
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:04,104
Oh.

247
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:05,612
Hey.

248
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:07,114
HILLARD: Oh, please.

249
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:09,446
JOHNER: You know I can't lay off
the tall ones.

250
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:11,145
How you doin'?

251
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:14,678
How about a little one-on-one?
What do you say?

252
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:22,459
You got some moves on you, girl.

253
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:24,465
CHRISTIE: Oh, man.

254
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,098
JOHNER: Mm-hmm.

255
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:48,155
Well, if you don't
wanna play basketball...

256
00:22:48,189 --> 00:22:50,180
I know some other indoor sports.

257
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:02,101
[Sniffs]

258
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:04,332
Come on, now,
give me the ball.

259
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:20,519
OK. I got a new game. Tag.

260
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,696
Ripley?

261
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:38,865
Ripley. [Whistles]

262
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,672
WREN: You've had enough fun.

263
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:52,176
What the hell are you?

264
00:24:02,697 --> 00:24:05,165
Something of a predator,
isn't she?

265
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,694
Yeah. She continues
to make us all very proud.

266
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:29,646
Ahh!

267
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:37,153
Mmm!

268
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:55,939
[Spits]

269
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:28,107
TV: We're coming up on just one
minute and 30 seconds left...

270
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:30,117
to order this unique
collector's item.

271
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:31,618
Jesus Christ, Johner!

272
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:35,111
What do you put in this shit,
battery acid?

273
00:25:35,156 --> 00:25:36,646
JOHNER: Justfor color.

274
00:27:26,832 --> 00:27:28,823
[Screeches]

275
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,107
[Growls]

276
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:48,643
So... we're a fast learner.

277
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:49,813
TV: Here's an item...

278
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:51,652
JOHNER: This is a really
good show, man.

279

and edgeware.

281
00:27:57,663 --> 00:28:00,632
The knife features
a stainless steel blade...

282
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:03,897
perfectfor any use
from hunting to the home.

283
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:07,963
The pro handle is made from
authentic antique plywood...

284
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:10,531
and stained in...

285
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:13,545
Hey, man, that shit
is not easy to come by!

286
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:16,571
Why don't you
take a walk outside?

287
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:21,283
[Drink spills]

288
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:23,613
Great!

CHRISTIE: lf bitches
can't handle this shit...

291
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,457
bitches should stay away
from this shit!

292
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:58,112
FATHER: ldentification, please.

293
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:05,552
Please try again.

294
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:11,559
Please try again.

295
00:29:14,673 --> 00:29:17,073
Thank you, General Perez.

296
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:54,110
RIPLEY: Well?

297
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:59,242
You gonna kill me or what?

298
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,952
There's no point, is there?

299
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:06,082
They've taken it out of you.

300
00:30:06,124 --> 00:30:07,557
Where is it?

301
00:30:07,592 --> 00:30:09,560
Is it on the ship?

302
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:13,564
You mean my "baby"?

303
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:16,600
I don't get it.

304
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:20,093
If they took it out,
why are they keeping you alive?

305
00:30:20,138 --> 00:30:22,606
Well, they're curious.

306
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:24,700
I'm the latest thing.

307
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:38,954
Look, I can make it all stop...
the pain, this nightmare.

308
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,652
That's all I can offer you.

309
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:53,665
What makes you think
I would let you do that?

310
00:30:58,176 --> 00:30:59,871
Who are you?

311
00:30:59,911 --> 00:31:03,574
Ripley, Ellen...
Lieutenant First Class...

00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:06,106
number36706.

313
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,714
Ellen Ripley died 200 years ago.

314
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:14,282
You're not her.

315
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:17,618
I'm not her.

316
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:26,604
Who am I?

317
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:29,607
CALL:
You're a thing... a construct.

318
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:32,508
They grew you in a fucking lab.

319
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:34,876
And now they brought it
out of you.

320
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:38,007
Not all the way out.

321
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:46,123
I can feel it...

322
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:49,127
behind my eyes.

323
00:31:49,161 --> 00:31:51,652
I can hear it moving.

324
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,535
You gotta help me stop
this thing before it gets loose.

325
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:04,871
RIPLEY: lt's too late.

326
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,071
You can't stop it.

327
00:32:07,112 --> 00:32:09,842
It's inevitable.

328
00:32:12,117 --> 00:32:14,585
Not as long as I'm around.

329
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:18,111
You'll never
get out of here alive.

330
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:20,624
I don't care.

331
00:32:22,127 --> 00:32:23,856
RIPLEY: Really?

332
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:28,122
I can make it stop.

333
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:38,097
Go on. Get out of here.

334
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:39,633
They're lookingfor you.

335
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:55,556
I think you're gonna find
that this was very ill-advised.

336
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,068
Where are herfriends?

337
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:58,569
SOLDIER: In the mess hall, sir.

338
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:01,971
Well, youfind them
now... quietly.

339
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:03,998
What the hell is going on here?

340
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:06,170
CHRISTIE: Smells
like a double-cross, boss.

341
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:11,008
Where's the other one
with the chair?

342
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,518
Don't ever touch me.

343
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:14,576
Ever!

344
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,588
You want to tell us
what this is?

345
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,021
Want to tell me
who you're workingfor?

346
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:19,024
What?

347
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:20,719
Wren, they got nothing
to do with this.

348
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,454
To do with what?

349
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:25,019
WREN: Know what the penalties
for terrorist activity are?

350
00:33:25,064 --> 00:33:27,032
ELGYN: No goddamn terrorists
on my crew.

351
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:29,034
Call, there something
you wanna tell me?

352
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:30,695
WREN: I don't care if you knew.

353
00:33:30,736 --> 00:33:33,330
You brought a terrorist
on board a military vessel.

354
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:36,739
And as far as I am concerned,
you all die with her!

355
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:39,574
Do you understand?

356
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:45,050
Yeah.

357
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:46,574
I understand.

SOLDIER: Stop!
Drop your weapons!

361
00:34:11,577 --> 00:34:15,445
And you, drop that piece of shit
or I blow his head off!

362
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:17,949
- Can't do that, man.
- Drop it now!

and they're all over it?

WREN: All the activity's been
by the barracks.

where the meat is.

532
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:20,529
If we wanna make decent time,
I say we ditch the cripple.

- No offense, man.
- None taken.

Not even you, Johner.

536
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,708
What's the quickest way out?

537
00:50:32,748 --> 00:50:35,945
After the cooling tower,
there's a freight elevator.

538
00:50:35,985 --> 00:50:37,680
It runs from the top...

539

level one deck.

540
00:50:39,488 --> 00:50:40,921
Take us straight to the dock.

541
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:42,150
Sounds reasonable.

542
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:43,681
Let's do it.

543
00:50:44,994 --> 00:50:46,154
We're moving.

544
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:48,963
What?

545
00:50:48,998 --> 00:50:51,364
RIPLEY: The ship is moving.
I can feel it.

546
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,392
The ship has stealthrun.
There's no way you can tell.

547
00:50:55,904 --> 00:50:57,929
She's right.

548
00:50:57,973 --> 00:50:59,804
Ship's been go since the attack.

549
00:50:59,842 --> 00:51:02,902
WREN: That's a standard
emergency procedure.

550
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:04,913
DISTEPHANO: That's right.
Any serious problem...

551
00:51:04,947 --> 00:51:07,415
and the ship autopilots
back to home base.

552
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:09,747
You were planning on
telling us this?

553
00:51:09,785 --> 00:51:11,582
Nobody asked.

554
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,953
HILLARD: What's home base?

555
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:18,392
Earth.

556
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:20,827
CHRISTIE: Oh, great.

557
00:51:20,863 --> 00:51:22,262
Bastard.

558
00:51:22,297 --> 00:51:25,824
JOHNER: Earth? I'd rather
stay here with the things, man.

559
00:51:25,868 --> 00:51:28,132
How long until we get to Earth?

560
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,933
Three hours almost.

561
00:51:29,972 --> 00:51:32,133
We got to blow the ship.

562
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:34,972
Call, you're not
blowing this ship.

563
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,342
Not while we're on it, OK?

564
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:41,372
We get out of this ship,
you do as you please, all right?

565
00:51:42,985 --> 00:51:46,580
Earth, man. What a shithole.

566
00:51:54,196 --> 00:51:55,493
RIPLEY: lt's clear.

567
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:03,431
Hey, Ripley.

568
00:52:08,444 --> 00:52:11,607
I heard you, like,
ran into these things before.

569
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:14,076
That's right.

570
00:52:14,116 --> 00:52:15,583
Wow, man.

571
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:19,280
So, like, what did you do?

572
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:23,823
I died.

573
00:52:50,953 --> 00:52:52,443
DISTEPHANO: Not that way!

574
00:52:58,254 --> 00:52:59,448
CHRISTIE: Ripley.

575
00:53:06,896 --> 00:53:08,386
Ripley, come on.

576
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,460
Ripley, we got no time
for sightseeing here.

577
00:53:18,608 --> 00:53:19,905

RIPLEY: Don't do what?

587
00:57:44,507 --> 00:57:46,873
What's the big deal, man?

588
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:49,036
Fucking waste of ammo.

589
00:57:49,078 --> 00:57:50,409
Let's go.

590
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:55,639
Must be a chick thing.

591
00:59:04,745 --> 00:59:05,939
Am I dreaming...

592
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,881
or is this not the shit
we brought with us?

593
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:11,441
CHRISTIE: Yeah.
It's the same shit.

594
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:14,477
It stinks in here, man.
Let's keep moving.

595
00:59:42,183 --> 00:59:45,050
Aah!

596
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:46,986
Get away from me!

597
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:50,784
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:54,424

601
00:59:54,462 --> 00:59:55,952
Get away from me.

602
00:59:58,733 --> 01:00:00,633
Get away from me.

603
01:00:01,635 --> 01:00:03,296
Who are you people?

604
01:00:04,372 --> 01:00:06,363
What's happening here?

605
01:00:06,407 --> 01:00:07,874
CHRISTIE: Calm down.
What's happening here...

606
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:10,502
is we're getting the fuck
off this ghost ship, OK?

607
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,571
Ship? What ship?

608
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,081
Where am I?

609
01:00:17,118 --> 01:00:21,179
I was in cryo, right?
On my way to Xarem.

610
01:00:21,222 --> 01:00:23,816
Work crew
for the nickel refinery, right?

611
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:27,817
I wake up.
I... I know I don't understand.

612
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:33,530
I woke up.
I... I saw horrible things.

613
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:38,027
Look, you're coming with us.
It's too dangerous for you here.

614
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:46,145
[Sniffs]

615
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:50,709
Leave him.

616
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:53,584
CALL: Fuck you.
We're not leaving him here.

617
01:00:53,621 --> 01:00:56,784
He's got one inside of him.

618
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:58,519
I can smell it.

619
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:03,293
PURVIS: Inside me?

620
01:01:04,632 --> 01:01:06,190
Inside me?

621
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:08,428
What's inside me?

622
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:11,097
I don't want one of those things
birthing anywhere near my ass.

623
01:01:11,138 --> 01:01:12,469
It's a bad risk.

624
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:15,100
What's inside me?

625
01:01:15,142 --> 01:01:17,042
We can't just leave him here.

626
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:19,011
CHRISTIE: I thought
you wanted to stop them.

627
01:01:19,046 --> 01:01:21,844
- What's inside me?
- Can't you stop it?

628
01:01:21,882 --> 01:01:23,349
CHRISTIE: Got no time for that.

629
01:01:23,384 --> 01:01:25,352
WREN: Not here.
The lab is damaged.

630
01:01:25,386 --> 01:01:28,321
CHRISTIE: I could do him.
Back of the head.

631
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,323
Painless.
It might be the best way.

632
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:31,790
What's inside me?

633
01:01:31,826 --> 01:01:34,761
- Got to be another way.
- What if we freeze him?

634
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:36,695
What's in-fucking-side me?!

635
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:50,677
There's a monster
in your chest.

636
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:54,238
These guys hijacked your ship...

637
01:01:54,281 --> 01:01:58,684
and they sold your cryotube
to this human...

638
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,485
and he put an alien
inside of you.

639
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:05,390
It's a really nasty one.

640
01:02:05,426 --> 01:02:07,189
And in a few hours...

641
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:09,856
it's gonna burst its way
through your rib cage...

642
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:11,888
and you're gonna die.

643
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:19,597
Any questions?

644
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,170
Who are you?

645
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:32,383
I'm the monster's mother.

646
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,158
CALL: Look, he comes with us.

647
01:02:38,192 --> 01:02:41,423
We freeze him on the Betty.
The doctor can remove it later.

648
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:56,699
JOHNER: lt's a mess down there.
Is this the only way?

649
01:02:56,744 --> 01:02:59,235
CHRISTIE:
Vriess, we gotta lose the chair.

650
01:03:01,715 --> 01:03:02,704
I know.

651
01:03:03,717 --> 01:03:05,685
Kawlang maneuver, all right?

652
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:08,347
Yeah. Just like old times.

653
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:09,583
Yeah.

654
01:03:13,727 --> 01:03:15,695
VRIESS:
Must be the cooling tanks.

655
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:18,857
Somebody must've opened
the valves.

656
01:03:18,899 --> 01:03:22,062
CHRISTIE: The nasties couldn't
have done this, could they?

657
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,205
WREN: We're at the bottom
of the ship.

658
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:38,218
We have to go
through the kitchen...

659
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:39,776
maybe 90 feet...

660
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,380
to the freight elevator
on the other side.

661
01:03:42,423 --> 01:03:44,789

01:13:59,889 --> 01:14:02,551
Baby, am I glad to see you.

726
01:14:02,592 --> 01:14:04,583
I was sure that asshole got ya.

727
01:14:04,627 --> 01:14:05,753
Are you hurt?

728
01:14:05,795 --> 01:14:07,524
I'm fine.

729
01:14:07,564 --> 01:14:09,293
You got body armor on?

730
01:14:09,332 --> 01:14:10,799
Yeah. Come on.

731
01:14:10,834 --> 01:14:13,428
You took it in the chest.
I saw it.

732
01:14:35,503 --> 01:14:36,697
You're a robot?

733
01:14:38,873 --> 01:14:40,340
JOHNER: Son of a bitch!

734
01:14:40,374 --> 01:14:42,399
Our little Call's
justfull of surprises.

735
01:14:42,443 --> 01:14:45,708
RIPLEY: I should have known.
No human being is that humane.

736
01:14:45,746 --> 01:14:49,375
JOHNER: I thought synthetics
were supposed to be all logical.

737
01:14:49,417 --> 01:14:51,817
You're a big old psycho, girl.

738
01:14:51,852 --> 01:14:53,217
PURVIS: You're a robot?

739
01:14:53,254 --> 01:14:55,381
You're a Second Gen, aren't you?

740
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:58,885
You're an Auton.

741
01:14:58,926 --> 01:15:02,259
A robot...
designed by robots, right?

742
01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:03,490
JOHNER: Hah!

743
01:15:03,531 --> 01:15:05,328
That's right. I remember.

744
01:15:05,366 --> 01:15:08,529
They were supposed to revitalize
the synthetic industry.

745
01:15:08,569 --> 01:15:11,663
Instead, they buried it.
[Laughs]

746
01:15:11,705 --> 01:15:13,730
They don't like
being told what to do.

747
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:15,708
The government ordered a recall.

748
01:15:15,743 --> 01:15:21,807
Now, I heard that only a few
had gotten out intact.

749
01:15:21,849 --> 01:15:25,080
Man! I never thought
that I'd see one!

750
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:29,112
Great. She's a toaster oven.

751
01:15:29,156 --> 01:15:30,555
Can we leave now?

752
01:15:32,059 --> 01:15:33,219
DISTEPHANO: Ha ha!

753
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:35,387
RIPLEY: How long before we land?

754
01:15:35,429 --> 01:15:36,896
DISTEPHANO:
Just under two hours.

755
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:39,092
Hey, Vriess,
you got a socket wrench?

756
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:41,101
Maybe she just needs
an oil change.

757
01:15:41,135 --> 01:15:42,602
FATHER:
I'm sorry. Access denied.

758
01:15:42,636 --> 01:15:44,604
I can't believe
I almostfucked it.

759
01:15:44,638 --> 01:15:46,469
Yeah, like you never
fucked a robot!

760
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:48,475
RIPLEY:
lf Wren gets in the computer...

761
01:15:48,509 --> 01:15:50,067
he could really screw us.

762
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:51,578
JOHNER:
We gotta find a terminal.

763
01:15:51,612 --> 01:15:53,136
DISTEPHANO: There's
no console on this level.

764
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,512
- We'd have to go back.
- We can't go back.

765
01:15:55,549 --> 01:15:57,312
And I don't know any
of Wren's access codes.

766
01:15:57,351 --> 01:15:58,511
Help me.

767
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:01,314
Call?

768
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:05,383
No... I can't.

769
01:16:05,426 --> 01:16:07,519
Right.
You're the new model droid.

770
01:16:07,561 --> 01:16:09,586
You can access
the mainframe by remote.

771
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:11,097
CALL: No, I can't.

772
01:16:11,132 --> 01:16:13,259
I burned my modem. We all did.

773
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,201
VRIESS: Call, you can still
patch in manually.

774
01:16:16,237 --> 01:16:17,499
You know that.

775
01:16:17,538 --> 01:16:20,439
DISTEPHANO: There's ports
in the chapel up there.

776
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:24,143
Call...

777
01:16:29,717 --> 01:16:31,378
RIPLEY:
You're programmedfor that?

778
01:16:31,418 --> 01:16:33,511
CALL: Don't make me do this.

779
01:16:33,554 --> 01:16:35,351
Don't make me make you.

780
01:16:35,389 --> 01:16:36,856
[Sighs]

781
01:16:36,891 --> 01:16:39,291
I don't want to go in there.

782
01:16:39,326 --> 01:16:42,159
It's like my insides are liquid.
It's not real.

783
01:16:42,196 --> 01:16:43,663
Get over it.

784
01:16:43,697 --> 01:16:46,530
You can blow the ship
before it reaches Earth...

785
01:16:46,567 --> 01:16:48,467
and kill them all.

786
01:16:58,913 --> 01:17:01,643
Just give us time
to get outfirst.

787
01:17:03,284 --> 01:17:05,650
Oh, damn it.

788
01:17:05,686 --> 01:17:06,846
Anything?

789
01:17:06,887 --> 01:17:08,047
Hold on.

790
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:16,886
[Robotic voice] Breach
in sector seven, sector three.

791
01:17:16,931 --> 01:17:20,458
Sector nine unstable.

792
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:23,129
Engines operating at 41 percent.

793
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:25,263
Eighty-six minutes
until Earth-dock.

794
01:17:25,306 --> 01:17:26,398
[Gasps]

795
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,567
[Normal voice]
We burned too much energy.

796
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:31,806
I can't make critical mass.
I can't blow it.

797
01:17:32,813 --> 01:17:34,405
Then crash it.

798
01:17:48,195 --> 01:17:49,492
I'm OK.

799
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:50,724
I'm OK.

800
01:17:52,266 --> 01:17:54,530
Really.

801
01:17:54,568 --> 01:17:56,058
lfeel good.

802
01:17:57,871 --> 01:18:00,362
CALL: [Robotic voice]
Ground level recalibrated.

803
01:18:00,407 --> 01:18:03,604
Time until impact now
43 minutes,8 seconds.

804
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:09,041
Try to clear us a path
to the Betty.

805
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:10,948
And start her up.

806
01:18:10,985 --> 01:18:12,282
OK.

807
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:42,540
[Robotic voice]
Please wait.

808
01:18:47,521 --> 01:18:51,116
Emergency override in
console four-five-V, level one.

809
01:18:54,862 --> 01:18:58,025
[Normal voice] lt's Wren.
He's almost at the Betty.

810
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:13,746
Father, locate the power drain.
Report.

811
01:19:16,383 --> 01:19:17,475
Father?

812
01:19:18,752 --> 01:19:19,912
Father!

813
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:27,226
CALL: [Robotic voice]
Father's dead, asshole.

814
01:19:31,065 --> 01:19:32,965
Intruder on level one.

815
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,096
All aliens, please proceed
to level one.

816
01:19:37,137 --> 01:19:39,128
You got a mean streak.

817
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:45,606
Aah! Damn it.

818
01:19:45,646 --> 01:19:47,910
- Let me see.
- Don't touch me.

819
01:19:47,948 --> 01:19:49,882
Come on.

820
01:19:49,917 --> 01:19:54,013
You must think
this is pretty funny.

821
01:19:54,054 --> 01:19:56,545
I'm finding a lot of things
funny lately.

822
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:59,150
But I don't think they are.

823
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,091
Why do you go on living?

824
01:20:11,772 --> 01:20:14,400
How can you stand
being what you are?

825
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,805
Not much choice.

826
01:20:21,849 --> 01:20:24,545
At least there's part of you
that's human.

827
01:20:24,585 --> 01:20:28,919
I'm just... Look at me.

828
01:20:28,956 --> 01:20:32,050
I'm disgusting.

829
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,154
Why did you come here?

830
01:20:36,196 --> 01:20:38,596
To kill you, remember?

831
01:20:38,632 --> 01:20:40,759
Before the recall...

832
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:43,827
I accessed the mainframe.

833
01:20:43,871 --> 01:20:45,338
Every dirty little covert op...

834
01:20:45,372 --> 01:20:47,499
the government ever dreamed of
is in there.

835
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:51,102
And this, you, the aliens...

836
01:20:51,145 --> 01:20:52,942
even the crew from the Betty.

837
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,278
I knew if they succeeded,
it'd be the end of them.

838
01:20:55,315 --> 01:20:58,443
Why do you care
what happens to them?

839
01:20:58,485 --> 01:21:01,420
Because I'm programmed to.

840
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:04,447
You're programmed
to be an asshole?

841
01:21:05,559 --> 01:21:08,790
You're the new asshole model
they're putting out?

842
01:21:08,829 --> 01:21:10,490
- Come on.
- [Footsteps]

843
01:21:13,367 --> 01:21:15,169
I guess we're almost there.

844
01:21:16,437 --> 01:21:18,371
DISTEPHANO:
lt's not so far now!

845
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,873
PURVIS: God, I am so tired!

846
01:21:19,907 --> 01:21:21,340
JOHNER: Sleep when you die, man!

847
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:35,155
PURVIS:
Oh, no. This is bad, right?

848
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:36,986
I think we're near the nest.

849
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:39,151
Well, then we'll go another way.

850
01:21:39,193 --> 01:21:42,060
- We don't have time.
- We got nearly 90 minutes.

851
01:21:42,096 --> 01:21:44,155
- Not anymore.
- What are you saying?

852
01:21:44,198 --> 01:21:46,291
JOHNER: What did you do, robot?

853
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:47,801
Let's go. Come on.

854
01:21:47,835 --> 01:21:51,635
Hey! You want to die here with
your brothers and sisters...

855
01:21:51,672 --> 01:21:54,835
that's cool,
but I plan to live past today!

856
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,571
So if this little
hunk of plastic...

857
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:59,580
is pullin' any shit,
I'm gonna kill her!

858
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:04,012
Kill you! Does that compute?

859
01:22:04,051 --> 01:22:07,020
Or do I have to draw you
a schematic?

860
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:08,487
Hey!

861
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,787
[Gagging]

862
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:12,315
You want another souvenir?

863
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:21,960
How far are the docks?

864
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:23,470
A hundred yards.

865
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:35,980
CALL: Ripley?

866
01:22:37,685 --> 01:22:39,516
Ripley!

867
01:22:40,688 --> 01:22:42,781
Come on!

868
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,883
Ripley, we have to go!

869
01:22:46,727 --> 01:22:48,786
I hear them.

870
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,390
I hear them. They're so close.

871
01:22:51,432 --> 01:22:52,865
Ripley.

872
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:53,958
RIPLEY: lt's the queen.

873
01:22:54,001 --> 01:22:56,401
She's in pain.

874
01:23:00,341 --> 01:23:01,501
Ripley!

875
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:04,670
Ripley!

876
01:23:04,712 --> 01:23:05,906
Wait!

877
01:23:28,736 --> 01:23:30,294
Oh, my God.

878
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:45,011
PURVIS: We got to be moving.

879
01:23:45,052 --> 01:23:48,385
The best thing you can do
is pray for a quick death.

880
01:23:48,422 --> 01:23:50,049
Come on.

881
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,353
Come on.

882
01:23:51,392 --> 01:23:53,326
CALL: lt's not right.

883
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,852
PURVIS:
I've been saying that all day.

884
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:54,778
VRIESS: lt's up to you, Call.

885
01:24:54,822 --> 01:24:58,588
Patch into the ship again
and open the hatch.

886
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:11,698
CALL: Johner, we should
put Purvis in the freezer.

887
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:13,229
JOHNER: All right, little buddy.

888
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:16,506
Nap time.

889
01:25:19,213 --> 01:25:20,680
Aah!

890
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:29,048
Nobody moves, or I put a cap
where this droid's brain is.

891
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,957
Distephano, take the weapons.

892
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:34,427
Begging your pardon,
sir, butfuck you!

893
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:38,228
Oh, fine, then I kill her,
and you kill me...

894
01:25:38,265 --> 01:25:41,359
and we all die,
and nobody goes home!

895
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:43,870
Now drop the weapon!

896
01:25:48,142 --> 01:25:50,610
Then this little
synthetic bitch...

897
01:25:50,644 --> 01:25:52,407
is gonna plug
into the Auriga...

898
01:25:52,446 --> 01:25:55,472
and she is gonna take us
right back to home base...

899
01:25:55,516 --> 01:25:58,007
according to the standard
emergency procedures.

900
01:25:58,052 --> 01:25:59,519
No, she's not!

901
01:25:59,553 --> 01:26:03,489
DISTEPHANO: Are you crazy?
