It's early. It's really early.

You know, I never
told anybody this,

197

but once for about three days,

198
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,430
just before her time,

199
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,221
Teresa's arm went completely dead.

200

What do you mean?

201
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,608
Her left arm.

202
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,686
It was numb.

203

She said she couldn't use it.

204
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,909

she was taking.

I doubt it was a drug problem.

209
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,881
It was probably a nerve problem.

210
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,179
I could recheck the
arm for injuries,

211
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,805
but I'd have to take the body back to
Portland to do some real nerve work.
