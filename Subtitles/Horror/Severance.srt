1
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,770
Mr George, help us.

2
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,773
- Help us.

3
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:08,735
- I'm sorry.
- You fucking pig!

4
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,661
Fuck!

5
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,817
Nadia.

6
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,058
# Over bridge of sighs

7
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,395
# To rest my eyes in shades of green

8
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,108
# Under dreaming spires

9
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,111
# To ltchycoo Park
that's where I've been

10
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,739
- # What did you do there?
- # I got high

11
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,785
- # What did you feel there?
- # Well, I cried

12
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:26,248
- # But why the tears there?
- # Tell you why

13
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,668
# It's all too beautiful

14
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,505
# It's all too beautiful

15
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:37,593
# It's all too beautiful

16
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,262
# It's all too beautiful

17
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:45,559
Hi. My name's George Cinders and I'm
the President of Palisade Defence.

18
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,061
We're hitting a home run for freedom

19
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:52,065
and a time out for terror.

20
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,277
We work hard to bring you
up-to-the-minute technology.

21
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,281
Memo. "Must congrat George
on terrific performance."

22
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:03,202
Er, no, delete "terrific",
make that "fabulous performance".

23
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,040
For 75 years we've been supplying
the world's greatest nations

24
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,125
with the world's latest weaponry.

25
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,088
So when you see this symbol,
you know you're in safe hands.

26
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:21,261
We have offices in New York,
London, Tokyo, all over the world.

27
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,305
Oh!

28
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,850
Whoo-hoo!

29
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,479
Jesus!

30
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,066
Go on, girl. Go on. Yep. Yep.

31
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,444
- What are you doing?
- Ordering myself a birthday present.

32
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,822
Alright, team, can we have
a little less talking, please?

33
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,575
Does nobody care
about our marketing strategy?

34
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,577
I care.

35
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,371
Or what about

36
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,915
our CRM- 114 landmine,
the Platoon Buster?

37
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,542
"What Ordinance?" magazine

38
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,336
calls it
"The most exciting development

39
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,922
in concealed termination in years."

40
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,757
Weapons you can trust.

41
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:03,178
Anti-personnel devices
you can rely on. That's trust.

42
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:08,267
That's reliability. That's Palisade.
As I speak,

43
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,895
our team of dedicated individuals
are touring Eastern Europe,

44
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,232
bringing the Palisade message to you.

45
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,318
- They couldn't be more excited.
- Richard,

46
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,530
why are all the actors
in this video white?

47
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:25,784
- They're not all white.
- Blonde, actually.

48
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,412
It's just a coincidence, that's all.

49
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,416
If they were all black,
that would be a coincidence, too?

50
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,378
Look... Look,
what is your problem exactly?

51
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,506
You've made a recruitment video
for the Hitler Youth.

52
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,757
Ha!

53
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,135
- Richard, Richard.
- Oh, there!

54
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:48,140
There you go, you see?
What's he, an albino?

55
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,101
Here's the P40 version five.

56
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,064
Oh, yeah, OK, that's very sensitive.

57
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,609
- It's not funny, Harris.

58
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,903
Freedom, democracy, justice.

59
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:05,365
With Palisade Defence,
we'll win the war on terror.

60
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,869
- I bloody hope not.
- Thank you, Harris.

61
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,539
# What will we do there?

62
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,124
# We'll get high

63
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,920
- # What will we touch there?
- # We'll touch the sky

64
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:22,841
- # But why the tears there?
- # I'll tell you why

65
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:26,345
# It's all too beautiful

66
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,180
# It's all too beautiful

67
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,477
# It's all too beautiful

68
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,525
Something's wrong with the electrics
in there. There's a short circuit.

69
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,944
- Fire officer, coming through.
- Sit down.

70
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,278
Officer sitting.

71
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,489
- No smoking!
- Yes, I know.

72
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:50,369
No cigarettes!
Bob Marley! Bob Marley!

73
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,943
Billy, what's the plan?

74
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,737
George should be at the lodge
with the food.

75
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,615
- Good. And the paintball gear?
- All in the brown bag.

76
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,911
- OK, good.

77
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,884
I'll give you $50 if you stop eating.

78
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:54,850
I bought some mushrooms off
a security guard at the road show.

79
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,770
I gave him 20 euros and look
how much he's given me. Look.

80
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,818
- They look horrible.
- That's cos they're magic mushrooms.

81
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,779
How do you know they're not
off the side of the road?

82
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:11,742
No, they're proper.
You can tell by the stalks. Look.

83
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:19,249
- Eat those, you're gonna go crazy.
- I think I've had these ones before.

84
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,336
They give you
a nice chilled-out one.

85
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,879
And if you're wrong?

86
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,591
I'll be somewhere over the rainbow
getting fucked by the Tin Man.

87
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,473
- Hey, what the fuck's going on?
- You alright?

88
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,059
- You alright, Jill?
- Yeah.

89
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,437
- The road's blocked.
- Anybody need first aid?

90
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,356
I might do in 20 minutes.

91
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,612
We can go this way.

92
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,621
I don't understand
what you're saying. The road is fine.

93
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:06,004
Yeah, well, the two roads
meet up again. Look.

94
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,226
It's just a detour!

95
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,612
Go on, Richard.

96
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:36,410
Alright, that's quite enough.

97
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:41,957
I won't stand for this unprofessional
behaviour. You hear me?

98
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,961
Now, you are hired to drive,
and drive you will, buddy.

99
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,046
Is that clear?

100
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:02,936
Great management skills, Dick.
Really, really world class.

101
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:11,069
I know it doesn't appear far on the
map, but it all depends on the scale.

102
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:15,240
- Well, what is the scale?
- It's not on here.

103
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,160
Well, an inch is usually a mile,
isn't it?

104
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,706
- No.
- Well, we'll assume that it is.

105
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,001
Well, we can assume,
but it's probably safer not to.

106
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,086
Every map I've seen,
an inch is a mile.

107
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,922
Are you saying I can't read maps?

108
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,841
No. I'm sure you have
an excellent knowledge of maps.

109
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,094
It's just that, well,
an inch could be two miles or ten.

110
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,931
I'm saying goodbye.
I'm going back to the hotel.

111
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,351
- You're doing no such thing.
- Then show me the lodge.

112
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,978
The lodge is a mile down that road.

113
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:48,899
Hang on. You're not listening to me.
I am not walking anywhere.

114
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,778
Don't squabble, gang. It's supposed
to be a team-building weekend.

115
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,907
Tell Richard. He seems to think
we're on a walking holiday.

116
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:02,913
Whoa. Wait a sec.
Stop the coach! Stop.

117
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:09,294
Hey, come on, let's talk about this.
Stop the bus. Fucking hell!

118
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,547
Stop the...

119
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,257
Come on!

120
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,471
Fuck it!

121
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,437
What was that?

122
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,941
Sorry.

123
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,945
Probably just a bear.

124
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,699
- Just a bear?
- There are no bears in Hungary.

125
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,993
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

126
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,746
Well, that's assuming
we're still in Hungary.

127
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,333
If we've crossed the border
into Romania, then there are bears.

128
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:52,337
If we're in Serbia,
then I'm not sure.

129
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:56,758
Well, that's really interesting. Are
bears required to stop at borders?

130
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,803
Is there some sort of
passport control for bears?

131
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,389
- You'd better watch your tone.
- Or what?

132
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,391
- Oh, please!
- No. Or what?

133
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,440
- That sounded further away.
- There.

134
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:16,612
If it was a bear, which it wasn't,
it's moved on. Come on.

135
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,698
I really think we should stick
to the main road.

136
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,075
No, this way is much quicker.
Come on.

137
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,161
I'm with Richard.

138
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,344
Have I pissed myself?

139
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,931
- What?
- I feel damp.

140
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,811
Well, you look alright.
I'm not gonna touch you.

141
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,314
- Have I pissed my pants?
- I don't think so.

142
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,733
- What's wrong with you?
- I feel all damp.

143
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,911
You're fine. You're fine.

144
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:58,213
OK, so, er, working on the assumption
that an inch is not a mile,

145
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:01,300
what's the worst-case scenario?

146
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,927
- An inch is a thousand miles.

147
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,727
That's Steve.

148
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,354
If he's messing around,
he's in big trouble.

149
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,735
Oh, no.

150
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,240
We should stay with the bags.

151
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,119
Steve, are you alright, mate?

152
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,629
Jesus.

153
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,924
Steve?

154
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,177
I saw someone.

155
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,013
Who?

156
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,599
I don't know.

157
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,142
What happened?

158
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,648
The weirdest thing's just happened,
yeah?

159
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,944
I needed a slash,
so I've pulled me trousers down,

160
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,614
cos I felt a little bit damp
and I didn't want to get a rash.

161
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,451
I was about to have a piss
and I saw a geezer with a balaclava

162
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:13,747
and a suitcase.
No, more of a travel bag.

163
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:16,250
- So, you've come over...
- Steve.

164
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,877
- Yes?
- The mushrooms.

165
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:24,258
- What mushrooms?
- You ate them. You're high.

166
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,057
- Look after him.
- OK, yeah.

167
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,104
Listen.

168
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,816
Now, I know we're mates, but, erm,

169
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,069
if you look at my cock one more time,
I'm gonna kick off.

170
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:48,866
What are you talking about? I have
not once looked at your winkie.

171
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,951
You turn around.

172
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,374
OK, everybody, prepare to smile.

173
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,803
- Isn't it wonderful?
- It's a dump.

174
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:55,224
- What do you expect, the Hilton?
- The Hilton would be good.

175
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:58,769
- We're in the country.
- You're not gonna stay here?

176
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:03,357
- Right now, I'd sleep in a cave.
- That's the spirit.

177
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,735
There's someone in the woods.

178
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:12,115
Yeah, you already said that.
Come on. Come on.

179
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,549
- This isn't the right place.
- This is the right place.

180
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,676
This obviously
is not the right place.

181
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,887
It is the right place. Billy?

182
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,223
Well, there's only one lodge
on the map,

183
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,559
- so I suppose...
- Thank you.

184
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,147
This is... just the lobby.

185
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,275
This place is fantastic.

186
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,988
Steve.
It's just a rope. It's just a rope.

187
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:42,456
"Dear team, as a big thank you
for the last few weeks on the road,

188
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:47,878
George and I cordially invite you
to join us on a team-building weekend

189
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:52,549
in Palisade's
newly acquired luxury lodge."

190
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,178
Luxury lodge.

191
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,811
OK, OK, OK, now listen up, everyone.

192
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:08,440
This is not a holiday.
This is a business.

193
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:14,029
And team-building weekends, like it
or not, are part of that business.

194
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,240
Hear hear!

195
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,827
This is our chance
to find out about ourselves.

196
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:23,580
I mean, you know,
sure, we'll have fun,

197
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,875
doing, er, paintball, orienteering...

198
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,294
- Bridge building.
- Bridge building.

199
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,467
We need to take ownership
of the weekend.

200
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,098
And that means working together.

201
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,433
- Richard, I have an idea.
- Shh, shh.

202
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:47,855
I can't spell success... without U.

203
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,567
And U...

204
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,903
And U... U...

205
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,114
And... U.

206
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,825
Success has only one U.

207
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,953
Oh, well.

208
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,915
Daddy couldn't put us all
through Cambridge, could he, Harris?

209
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,587
Now, George wants us to be
the best team possible.

210
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,590
And if that means digging in
a little, then I'm sorry.

211
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,676
Think this place is a dump?
Think about this.

212
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,890
Maybe it's supposed to be.
I've had tougher challenges.

213
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,684
Now let's make this our challenge.

214
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,812
Explain to me
how staying in this shithole

215
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,815
is gonna help me sell mines.

216
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,076
Alright?

217
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,555
- Don't be so happy all the time.
- Only trying to be positive.

218
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:07,559
You're not. You're like a dog
tied to a radiator wagging its tail.

219
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:12,356
That's not a compliment.

220
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,569
Look for the generator in there,
will you?

221
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:54,077
Have you got any light bulbs
in your bag, Gordon?

222
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:57,915
Erm, yeah. Give me two secs.

223
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,961
Hello?

224
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:10,177
Hello?

225
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,070
Oh, no.

226
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:32,366
- I think you should get some sleep.
- I think you're right.

227
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:10,589
Maggie?

228
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:15,636
I've been waiting for you, Richard.
I want you to fuck me.

229
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:18,639
Really?

230
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,225
I mean, I'd like to.

231
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:24,186
Fuck me now and fuck me hard.

232
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,731
OK.

233
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,695
But, erm... what's going on?

234
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:38,867
Maggie?

235
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:44,248
Great management skills, Dick.
World class.

236
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,158
I can't believe it.

237
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:22,661
I had no idea Palisade were
this involved in Eastern Europe.

238
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,621
You're joking, right?

239
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:30,043
- Where did you get this stuff?
- Found it next to the generator.

240
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:33,881
There's stacks of it out there.
It's all Soviet.

241
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,425
That doesn't mean
it's one of the asylums.

242
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:39,261
- It doesn't rule it out either.
- What asylums?

243
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:43,348
Right, grub's up.
Put those cards away, please, Jill.

244
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:48,270
Feast your eyes... on this.

245
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,772
Mind yourselves, it is hot.

246
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:54,276
It actually smells quite nice.

247
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,070
- Not eating?
- No, thanks. Not hungry.

248
00:28:57,154 --> 00:29:00,282
The rest of you,
get stuck in. There's plenty.

249
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,993
Do you want to get some spoons out,
please, Jill?

250
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,040
- Alright? Feeling OK?
- Yeah, alright, piss off.

251
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:13,170
- Are you still tripping?
- No. Why are you naked?

252
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,715
- Harris, what about the asylums?
- What asylums?

253
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,927
Harris seems to think we're in
an old lunatic asylum.

254
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,345
- Are we?
- No.

255
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,514
Tell us about the asylums.

256
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:27,100
Are you sure you want me to tell you?
It's pretty scary.

257
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:31,188
- I'll take my chances.
- OK. OK.

258
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,109
This story takes place a long time
ago, way before the First World War.

259
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:37,903
Oh, please.

260
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,824
When movies were silent
and women were even quieter.

261
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:46,119
The government was getting
complaints about the asylum,

262
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:48,580
so they sent an inspector
to check it out.

263
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,464
He arrives late one night
to see what's going on.

264
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:04,429
Everything seems fine, and the
warders agree to show him around.

265
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:08,684
But everything isn't fine.
Everything's not fine at all.

266
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:12,688
All the inmates are going crazy,
screaming at him to let them out.

267
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:16,066
Then he realises what's wrong.

268
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:19,653
The inmates had taken over
and locked up all the doctors.

269
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:23,448
And then they turned on him.
He tried to reason with them,

270
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,535
but there's no reasoning
with the mentally insane.

271
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,622
Guess who they called
to sort out the mess? Us.

272
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:34,126
Palisade sent the boys in.
Sprayed the place with nerve agent.

273
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,128
Killed everyone. It was a massacre.

274
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:41,925
But rumour has it...
that one inmate survived,

275
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:47,055
hell-bent on killing any Palisade
employee that should cross his path.

276
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,146
They say he's still on the loose.

277
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:57,566
- Is that supposed to be scary?
- Well, it was at the time.

278
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,777
Believe it or not, there is
a tiny bit of truth in his story.

279
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,946
- Damn right!
- A tiny bit.

280
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,950
It occurred in the early '90s
when the Soviet Union broke up.

281
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:11,705
Places like this were
detention centres for war criminals.

282
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:14,958
Soldiers who liked the killing
a little bit too much.

283
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,395
They were lunatics who wiped out
whole villages. Burnt people alive.

284
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:40,484
Put heads on spikes. They were
savages. Well-trained savages.

285
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:47,366
Their government locked them away,
tried to cure them,

286
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,368
but it was no good.

287
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:57,251
Some escaped. Hid in some empty
buildings nearby, but not for long.

288
00:31:57,334 --> 00:32:01,839
Obviously it wasn't Palisade who
killed them, it was their government.

289
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:04,925
But it was us
who supplied the weapons.

290
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,887
Oh, and, Harris,
if anyone did survive,

291
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:11,849
revenge would be the last thing
on their minds.

292
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:16,770
- What would be on their minds?
- Survival. Evading capture.

293
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:19,565
These guys were war criminals,
remember.

294
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:24,486
Excuse me for being the only sensible
one here, but this place is a lodge.

295
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,865
It's not a mental home,
it's not a prison, it's a lodge.

296
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:31,952
- It was a sex lodge.

297
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:35,205
- Right.
- It was. I'm telling you.

298
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:40,294
Back in the '60s, these places
were hospitals for rich old men.

299
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:45,465
All the nurses were these naughty-
looking birds with big shooters.

300
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:49,678
Anyway, being stuck all the way out
here, they used to get really lonely,

301
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,014
so they tried it on
with the old boys.

302
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:55,017
These poor old fuckers
was on death's door.

303
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,977
They couldn't get it up.

304
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,023
So they decided to just get hold
of each other.

305
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:03,442
One day this fella turns up
out of the blue.

306
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:06,945
Young geezer.
Bit of bollocks about him.

307
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:15,579
They chased him.
They caught him and, er,

308
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:18,040
well, he was fucked.

309
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:24,046
Have you ever taken
anything seriously in your life?

310
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:27,257
- Ecstasy and weed, I think.

311
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:33,222
- Hey, gang. How are we doing?
- Brilliant.

312
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:34,389
Sweet dreams?

313
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:38,435
Er... yeah.

314
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,771
Harris.

315
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,525
Hi, Maggie. Not eating?

316
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:48,737
Why are you all so obsessed with
what I eat? I am not too skinny.

317
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:51,114
No, no, no, no. I don't mean...

318
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:55,494
Just that you'll need your energy
for the team games.

319
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,580
I mean, you're perfect
just the way you are.

320
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:07,089
And when I say perfect, I obviously
don't mean that in a sexual way.

321
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:10,509
I mean perfect in a neutral way.

322
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:16,181
As if I were another woman saying
that you were perfect, you know?

323
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:19,434
Just one woman to another.

324
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,607
Not that I'm implying
anything like that.

325
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:31,488
Or that there's anything wrong
with that... sort of thing.

326
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,326
Or... anything.

327
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,788
Keep digging,
we can still see you.

328
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,961
What the?

329
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,964
A bit young to be losing
your teeth, aren't you?

330
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,591
It's not mine.

331
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:53,510
- It's not my tooth.
- Maybe it's just a clove.

332
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:57,055
Does it look like a fucking clove?
I'm gonna puke.

333
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,809
- Could it be the cow's tooth?
- A cow with gold fillings?

334
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:03,061
Who made the pie?

335
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:06,273
I didn't make it, I found it.

336
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:08,525
- You what?
- I found it.

337
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,486
You found a pie?

338
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,865
- It was wrapped in foil.
- Oh, well, that's a relief. Jesus!

339
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,617
You dirty bastard.

340
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,119
- OK, everyone, calm down.

341
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:23,123
- Come on, Jill. Jill, come with me.

342
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,958
Ohh! I'm gonna be sick.

343
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:30,214
OK, I'm sorry.
I thought it was a welcome gift.

344
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:35,385
- From who?
- I don't know. George.

345
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:38,263
George wouldn't bring a pie.

346
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:42,059
It could have been sitting here
for months. Look at this place.

347
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:43,936
I cooked it for the full hour!

348
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:47,648
- It had instructions on it?
- No, but it's a pie.

349
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:50,609
You don't cook every pie for an hour.

350
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:55,614
- Do you think I undercooked it?
- Fucking hell!

351
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:59,409
Yeah, OK. Look, it's gone.
I'm throwing the pie in the bin.

352
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,912
Oh, right, that makes me feel better.

353
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:17,636
- Night, sweetie.
- Good night.

354
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,644
- Oh! Shit!

355
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,875
Hello.

356
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:14,378
Hello!

357
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:33,272
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's the matter? What's going on?

358
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:35,148
There was a man at my window.

359
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:39,236
- What happened?
- I saw someone. Where's my inhaler?

360
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,613
- What's going on?
- Jill saw someone.

361
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,532
- Who?
- What did he look like?

362
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:47,995
- He had a mask.
- Have you been at my mushrooms?

363
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:52,374
- Is there anything to calm her down?
- I'll check my bag.

364
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,543
- Did you see anyone?
- No.

365
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:58,547
- What do you think?
- You're the boss, you think.

366
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,968
- Perhaps you were dreaming.
- I wasn't dreaming. Look at me!

367
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:06,763
His face was covered in a mask!
I was not dreaming!

368
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,099
I found some Kalms. They're herbal.

369
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:55,103
Come on. There's no one here.

370
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,856
Come on!

371
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:05,531
It was probably just some locals
messing around.

372
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:11,245
Looking through a window one storey
up? We need to get out of here.

373
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:14,414
- Yeah, I'm leaving.
- I'm going with her.

374
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:16,959
- No one is going anywhere.
- What did you find?

375
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:20,295
There are wooden structures,
but they're not near the window.

376
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:22,881
- There. See?
- This is what's gonna happen.

377
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:26,009
Tomorrow, we go to the top of
the hill, try and get a signal.

378
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,804
Get somebody to pick us up,
take us back.

379
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:31,557
- Go on, my son.
- Great idea.

380
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,520
That is not a great idea. Leave, and
you won't have a job to come back to.

381
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:40,148
- I don't care. Count me in.
- Yeah, I'm with her.

382
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:46,196
- I'm sorry, but he's right.
- Should I make some tea?

383
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,659
Er, alright, listen.

384
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:53,162
Jill, I want you to sleep on it.

385
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:56,165
Then, in the morning,
if you still feel the same way,

386
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:58,959
well, then I'll come up with a plan.

387
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,587
I feel the same way.

388
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:11,180
OK, er, listen up, everyone.
Er, Billy, get over here. Come on.

389
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:19,938
Er, I've made a decision.
We're going to sit tight.

390
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,524
We...

391
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:27,404
We sit tight while,
Harris, I want you and Jill

392
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:29,990
to go up the hill...

393
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:35,746
...to go up the hill and, erm,
see if you can get a phone signal.

394
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:39,750
Erm, get the coach driver
to come and pick us up.

395
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,627
Oh, sweet.

396
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:45,881
I've made this decision purely
because of the, er, food situation.

397
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:49,885
And... And it is conditional.

398
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:53,889
While they're gone, the rest of us
will do a little team building.

399
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:55,182
Yes!

400
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,979
Nice one.

401
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:04,233
Excuse me. Hiya. I just want
to make it really clear,

402
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:10,322
before we begin, that paintballing
is about teamwork, right?

403
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:15,536
So no Rambos.
I repeat, absolutely no Rambos.

404
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:35,222
OK!

405
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,906
- Hey, how's your project going?
- Pretty good, thanks.

406
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,993
What are these things?
Humane landmines, right?

407
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:59,454
They're not landmines.
They're immobilisation units.

408
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:05,085
Right. And they do what,
they sort of grab you, yeah?

409
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:09,464
They pin you to the floor.
They don't blow children's legs off.

410
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:12,759
- They're humane.
- They're a hard sell.

411
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:15,512
I don't understand why,
in the 21 st century,

412
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:19,349
we create such sick weapons.
The guillotine seems humane.

413
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:23,187
- There's nothing humane about it.
- At least it's instantaneous.

414
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,898
There's nothing instantaneous
about it.

415
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:30,319
When your head's chopped off, your
brain can think for three minutes.

416
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:33,697
You're saying you're aware
that your head's cut off?

417
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,700
When Marie Antoinette
had her head chopped off

418
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:41,413
she felt it hit the basket. She saw
blood pumping out of her own stump.

419
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:46,001
- That's not true.
- It is 100 percent biological fact.

420
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:57,471
- Think he crashed?
- I don't know.

421
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,378
- Oh, my God!
- We've got to get the others.

422
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:33,131
We can't just leave him here!

423
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:36,176
Can we?

424
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,310
I'm not saying
that I fancy anyone in particular.

425
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:49,940
But if I did like someone, I wouldn't
know the best way to approach them.

426
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:54,486
- Dating's complicated in England.
- English birds ain't complicated.

427
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,157
Buy 'em a Bacardi Breezer and
they'll ride you like Sea Biscuit.

428
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,118
Yeah? But what if she's not English?

429
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:05,706
What if she's, erm...
French or Spanish or, erm...

430
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,209
...American?

431
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:16,175
- Maggie?
- Yeah.

432
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,345
So what do you think?

433
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:26,602
I think you've got more chance of
getting shit out of a rocking horse.

434
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:32,483
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

435
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:44,661
Come on, I got you!
Get up, you cheating bastard.

436
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:52,294
See, all this Maggie stuff,
it's cos your bird left you.

437
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,755
It's cos your plums
are backing up.

438
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,131
It's driving you nuts.

439
00:45:56,215 --> 00:46:00,093
It's confusing you,
making you think you love her.

440
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:06,183
You're right.
Anyway, I think she likes you.

441
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,685
- What're you talking about?
- Go, go, go!

442
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,700
Hiya, sexy.

443
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:27,871
We won. You're dead.

444
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:31,500
The bullet missed my vital organs.
I survived. It's a miracle.

445
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:36,630
- Here we go.
- Safeties off.

446
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:37,923
Here comes the ref.

447
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:42,135
Right. Oh, you really got into that.
It was brilliant.

448
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:46,598
We bent a few rules here and there.
Steve shot Richard and he didn't die.

449
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:49,518
- No one shot me.
- We shot someone.

450
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:53,438
Well, I think someone,
and I'm not pointing any fingers,

451
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:57,109
has been wiping off paint. And it
does clearly state in the rules...

452
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:59,862
This is total war.
There are no rules.

453
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:00,988
Ow!

454
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:06,535
Stop! Stop! Stop it! Stop!

455
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:09,746
That is really dangerous!

456
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:14,251
Get one of those in your eye,
it could pop like a ping-pong ball.

457
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,712
It's not funny. That hurts.

458
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,176
I expect more from some of you.

459
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:34,062
Gordon, you've got to be still.

460
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:37,107
Steve, get on the other side. Quick!

461
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:40,235
- Be still.
- Get it off!

462
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,238
- You have to stop moving.

463
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:50,454
Pull your leg out.

464
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:53,916
- Now! Pull it now!
- Pull your leg out now!

465
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:01,215
Now!

466
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:04,468
- You fucking idiot!
- Alright, for fuck's sake!

467
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:06,178
We'll get you out.

468
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:11,975
Pull it out! Pull it out now!

469
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:15,979
Pull it!

470
00:48:21,735 --> 00:48:25,447
- God! OK, Gordon...

471
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:26,573
Shit!

472
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:33,455
We gotta stop the bleeding.
Billy, give me your belt.

473
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:36,708
You're gonna be OK.
You have to calm down, Gordon!

474
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:40,879
Calm down!
We're gonna stop the bleeding.

475
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:50,722
They're everywhere.

476
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:54,560
What the fuck's going on here?

477
00:48:57,187 --> 00:48:59,523
Billy, hold his hand!

478
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:03,402
- Can you help me?
- What are you doing?

479
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:07,197
- Richard, help me hold him!

480
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:08,615
Steve!

481
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:16,123
We're gonna be OK.

482
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:20,002
- Alright, people, get on the coach.
- Stop! Don't move!

483
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:22,963
- What the fuck happened?
- Bear traps everywhere.

484
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:25,424
Someone killed the driver.

485
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:28,677
- The driver's dead?
- Just get on the coach.

486
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,597
- Somebody help us, please!
- What are we gonna do?

487
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,892
- He could be watching us.
- You're not helping!

488
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,895
- What do we do with his leg?
- We need to keep it cold.

489
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:41,231
- There's a fridge on the coach.
- That's great, thank you.

490
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:43,942
Oh, you're shitting me!

491
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,589
Ohh!

492
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,264
Come on!

493
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:19,645
- Come on!
- Alright! Alright! For fuck's sake!

494
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:31,365
- Faster!
- It's going as fast as it can.

495
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,200
I need to cover his leg.

496
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:37,704
Harris, slow down.
I think you're going too fast.

497
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:41,625
Someone give me something
to cover his leg, for fuck's sake!

498
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:53,345
Shit!

499
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:55,676
Jill?

500
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:24,246
Oh, shit!

501
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,121
I think I've broken my arm.

502
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:40,716
Billy.

503
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:53,103
Jill?

504
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:59,693
We've got to head back to the lodge.

505
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:04,490
We've got to find Jill.

506
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:06,492
Jill!

507
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:08,368
Jill!

508
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:11,163
Keep your voice down.

509
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:16,335
Someone's killed Harris. Who's to say
he didn't kill Jill as well?

510
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:20,380
Now, we head back to the lodge

511
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:23,717
and we lock ourselves in till morning
and then we walk.

512
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,260
Where?

513
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:29,598
- I don't know.
- I'm glad we got that sorted!

514
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:33,060
Hey! Unless you have a better idea,
we go back to the lodge.

515
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:14,226
Palisade.

516
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:06,653
Let's put him down.

517
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:12,784
We need to lock ourselves in.
Lock everything.

518
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:16,788
- This is bollocks. Fucking bollocks.
- We're safer in here.

519
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:20,167
I'm not waiting for him to turn up.
It's fucking madness.

520
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,377
What do you suggest
we do with Gordon?

521
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:25,714
- I'll carry him myself.
- Keep your voices down.

522
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:29,092
- What if the stories were true?
- Well, mine wasn't.

523
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:30,344
What stories?

524
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:33,972
They were asylums. Someone escaped,
who knows we're Palisade.

525
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:37,559
- How would they know that?
- The bus. It's not exactly subtle.

526
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:40,813
Those stories are nonsense.
Who told you? Jill? Harris?

527
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:44,525
Know how many conspiracies I hear
regarding weapons companies?

528
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,319
- No, how many?
- I'll tell you how many I believe.

529
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:50,280
None. We're a public company.

530
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:53,367
Members of both our governments
are on the board.

531
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,327
They won't do anything immoral.

532
00:58:57,913 --> 00:59:00,833
Arguing is not gonna help us out.
OK?

533
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:03,460
You said you wanted us
to work as a team.

534
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:06,213
Well, now is the time to start.

535
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:09,007
Look, just help me get some wood.

536
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:11,677
We need to board ourselves in.
Alright?

537
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,097
- With what?
- I don't know. Check Gordon's bag.

538
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,433
He's not gonna have a hammer
and nails in there, is he?

539
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:26,692
Oh, for fuck's sake!

540
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:44,168
Good boy.

541
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:54,511
I've got some pills.

542
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,889
What kind of pills?

543
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:59,266
Ecstasy.

544
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:04,646
- Great. Have a party.
- No, not for me, for him.

545
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:05,981
What do you mean?

546
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:08,567
They're not gonna get him
up tap dancing,

547
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,320
but it'll take the edge off
for a while.

548
01:00:16,492 --> 01:00:17,618
OK.

549
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,703
Gordon.

550
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:27,044
- Take one. It'll sort you out.
- I don't do drugs.

551
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:30,255
It's OK, sweetheart,
these are painkillers.

552
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:34,051
- They're gonna make you feel better.
- Just take one.

553
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:37,638
Here. Here you go. Here you go.

554
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,032
You alright?

555
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:03,080
I'm sorry about earlier.
Flaring up and all that.

556
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:04,832
You were OK.

557
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:11,338
Listen, I wanna say something to you.

558
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:17,052
Sometimes I act like an idiot,
you know?

559
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:22,182
I say things when I shouldn't
and, er...

560
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:24,977
Shit, I've left Gordon's foot
on the the coach.

561
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:30,440
Sorry, mate.

562
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,282
I love you, Maggie.

563
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:43,203
- Of course you do.
- No, seriously. I mean it.

564
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:45,289
I really mean it.

565
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:50,085
- It's just the drugs, Gordon.
- No, it's not the drugs.

566
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:54,548
I really, really, really love you.

567
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,550
And I loved Jill.

568
01:01:56,633 --> 01:02:00,137
I really, really, really,
really loved Jill.

569
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:03,348
- Steve, have you got any downers?
- Not my thing.

570
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:07,352
Maggie. Maggie, have I told you
that I love you?

571
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:14,735
- Where are you going?
- Toilet.

572
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:17,738
Can't you hold on?

573
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:20,282
No.

574
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:27,789
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

575
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,143
If we don't get him to a hospital,
he's gonna die.

576
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:24,972
I think maybe... we should leave him.

577
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:29,977
What are you saying?

578
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:35,107
I think our best chance for survival

579
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:39,695
is if the four of us
get to the main road and get help.

580
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:45,659
And I think it's Gordon's
best shot as well.

581
01:03:45,742 --> 01:03:49,454
I think you're right.
I think we should go.

582
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:50,789
Go where?

583
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:13,604
- What's happened?
- This door was locked.

584
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:18,692
Gordon?

585
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:22,196
- Gordon?
- Billy, be quiet!

586
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:14,349
Conspiracies?

587
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:23,650
We should go back upstairs.

588
01:06:52,804 --> 01:06:55,265
- Maggie?

589
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:05,002
Richard?

590
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:11,550
Richard?

591
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:50,357
- Fuck!

592
01:11:26,537 --> 01:11:27,913
Jesus!

593
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:30,457
Ohh...

594
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:33,252
Yeah, well...

595
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:36,922
I'd hate to be accused of not
killing him when I had the chance.

596
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:42,135
Well... I think
you'll be alright there.

597
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:54,148
Come, come.

598
01:12:21,508 --> 01:12:24,261
- Don't you fucking move!

599
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:27,139
- We got a problem.
- Yeah, no shit!

600
01:12:27,222 --> 01:12:30,350
No, we got another problem.
That was our last bullet.

601
01:12:30,434 --> 01:12:32,853
Put your fucking guns down!

602
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:36,857
Put your guns down or I'll blow
your motherfucking balls off!

603
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:16,355
Let's go.

604
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:24,988
Stop. Stop!

605
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:29,660
- What are you doing?
- Don't move. The place is mined.

606
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:32,913
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on one.

607
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:37,584
CRM Platoon Buster. One of ours.

608
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:40,128
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

609
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:44,800
Where's Billy?

610
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:51,223
- Richard, they're coming.

611
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:56,019
Alright, follow my footsteps,
then jump to the trees.

612
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:04,528
Go.

613
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,656
Come on.

614
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:12,828
Hey, come on!

615
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:14,788
Come on!

616
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:28,886
Over here! Come on!

617
01:14:51,492 --> 01:14:53,202
You're laughing at me?

618
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:57,122
You won't be fucking laughing
when I take my foot off this.

619
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:33,867
# Yo, pretty ladies, around the world

620
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:38,247
# Got a weird thing to show you
so tell all the boys and girls

621
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:42,042
# Tell your brother,
your sister and your mama too

622
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:46,380
# Cos they're about to throw down
and you'll know just what to do

623
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:50,801
# Wave your hands in the air
like you don't care

624
01:15:50,884 --> 01:15:54,179
# Glide by the people
as they stop to look and stare

625
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:58,475
Hey! Maggie, Steve.
Where the hell've you been?

626
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:04,148
Are you Mr Steve? We are Nadia
and Olga from the escort agency.

627
01:16:29,006 --> 01:16:34,052
Yeah, come on, everybody.
Why not? Be my fucking guest.

628
01:16:39,057 --> 01:16:42,269
- Is this where we are?
- Whoa. What are you doing?

629
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:44,146
- Have you been to the lake?
- Yes.

630
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:45,772
- Are there boats?
- Yes.

631
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:47,649
Leave your shit and follow us.

632
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:57,868
Ready?

633
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:08,629
- Yeah.

634
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:22,726
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

635
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:26,647
George,

636
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:31,109
there are about five seriously sick
fuckers coming our way to kill us.

637
01:17:31,193 --> 01:17:34,738
So you can either help us
or fuck off.

638
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:39,243
When you say sick fuckers,
what do you mean? Terrorists?

639
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:42,454
- Call 'em what you want.
- Come on. Let's go.

640
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:45,040
Hold it. No one's going anywhere.

641
01:17:45,123 --> 01:17:48,210
I've been waiting to demonstrate this
for a while.

642
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:55,968
You stamp "terrorist" on it,
and I'll kill it.

643
01:17:57,511 --> 01:17:59,972
- Wait till they get a load of this.
- Sweet!

644
01:18:04,726 --> 01:18:07,187
Are those the little bastards?

645
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,983
- Alright, get back.

646
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:57,070
Steve?

647
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:00,866
Steve!

648
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:10,501
Steve!

649
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:14,713
- Where are you?
- Steve!

650
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:18,759
- Maggie?
- I'm in some kind of trap!

651
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:46,203
Steve, he's coming!

652
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:51,625
Oh, my God.

653
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:54,086
No!

654
01:20:31,498 --> 01:20:32,875
No!

655
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:39,047
God! Steve!

656
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,760
Steve! No!

657
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:09,077
Please!

658
01:21:11,497 --> 01:21:13,707
Please!

659
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:31,433
Get off of me!

660
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:30,719
Steve! Steve!

661
01:23:36,809 --> 01:23:39,144
This is gonna hurt.

662
01:23:41,855 --> 01:23:43,899
Steve!

663
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:47,444
Steve!

664
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,155
Steve!

665
01:26:52,588 --> 01:26:56,592
Hello. Hello. Do you speak English?

666
01:26:56,675 --> 01:26:58,510
- English?
- Yes. English.

667
01:26:58,594 --> 01:27:01,513
I need you to send help.

668
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:04,016
- I need help.
- Yes. Please hold.

669
01:29:06,513 --> 01:29:09,183
Come on, then, you fuck!

670
01:31:00,794 --> 01:31:02,171
Foursome?

671
01:31:14,016 --> 01:31:17,978
# We'll meet again

672
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:20,439
# Don't know where

673
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:23,692
# Don't know when

674
01:31:23,775 --> 01:31:27,738
# But I know we'll meet again

675
01:31:27,821 --> 01:31:31,408
# Some sunny day

676
01:31:34,495 --> 01:31:37,789
# Keep smiling through

677
01:31:39,041 --> 01:31:44,213
# Just like you always do

678
01:31:44,296 --> 01:31:51,678
# Till the blue skies
light the dark clouds far away

679
01:31:53,305 --> 01:31:57,601
# So will you please say hello

680
01:31:57,684 --> 01:32:00,687
# To the folks that I know?

681
01:32:00,771 --> 01:32:05,234
# Tell them I won't be long

682
01:32:05,317 --> 01:32:08,028
# You'll be happy to know

683
01:32:08,111 --> 01:32:11,031
# That as you saw me go

684
01:32:11,114 --> 01:32:15,202
# I was singing this song

685
01:32:16,328 --> 01:32:20,207
# We'll meet again

686
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:22,584
# Don't know where

687
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:25,796
# Don't know when

688
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:29,925
# But I know we'll meet again

689
01:32:30,008 --> 01:32:33,178
# Some sunny day

690
01:32:38,517 --> 01:32:40,519
We'll meet again.

691
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,148
Don't know where,

692
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:46,525
don't know when.

693
01:32:48,569 --> 01:32:51,113
But I know we'll meet again

694
01:32:51,196 --> 01:32:54,116
some sunny day.

695
01:32:59,955 --> 01:33:02,541
Keep smiling through,

696
01:33:02,624 --> 01:33:06,044
just like you always do...

697
01:33:08,714 --> 01:33:14,845
...till the blue skies
light the dark clouds far away.

698
01:33:18,557 --> 01:33:22,311
# So will you please say hello

699
01:33:22,394 --> 01:33:25,230
# To the folks that I know

700
01:33:25,314 --> 01:33:29,943
# And tell them I won't be long?

701
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:33,197
# You'll be happy to know

702
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:36,533
# That as you saw me go

703
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:40,871
# I was singing this song

704
01:33:41,163 --> 01:33:45,000
# We'll meet again

705
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:47,961
# Don't know where

706
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:51,340
# Don't know when

707
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:55,761
# But I know we'll meet again

708
01:33:55,844 --> 01:34:00,682
# Some sunny day

709
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:30,838
# The sun is shining

710
01:34:32,214 --> 01:34:35,342
# I can feel the good times coming on

711
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:40,973
# Oh, there's no point
trying to fight it

712
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:45,269
# We've been running away
for way too long

713
01:34:47,146 --> 01:34:50,858
# So there's a storm on the horizon

714
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:55,779
# Feels like there's trouble
on the way

715
01:34:55,863 --> 01:34:58,574
# But if you take my hand

716
01:34:58,657 --> 01:35:01,076
# And I'll take your hand

717
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:04,663
# Then there'll be no need
for us to stray

718
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:06,748
# At least not today

719
01:35:08,542 --> 01:35:10,669
# We're summertimin'

720
01:35:12,254 --> 01:35:15,257
# I can feel the good times
coming on

721
01:35:16,258 --> 01:35:17,718
# Coming on
