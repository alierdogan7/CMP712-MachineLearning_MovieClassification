00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:01,632
Terry?

168
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,168
Terry!

169
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:10,840
Aaah!

170
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:14,341
Aaah! Aaah!

171
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:16,481
Aaah!

172
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,913
Aaah!

173
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:35,693
Aaah! Aaah!

174
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:46,609
Wow!

175
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:51,280
God!

176
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:04,054
I can't find anyone out here.
They must've gone to the bottom
or drifted with the tide.

177
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:06,029
Well, I've got
witnesses that say...

178
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:08,931
there was one person in the boat
and one person water-skiing.

179
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:11,469
Told ya,
nothin' here.

180
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:14,734
Well, then I want you
to try dragging.

181
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:19,073
For how long? Current's
moving everything around and
it's gonna be dark pretty soon.

182
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:22,841
I don't care. I want you to
stay on it as long as it takes.

183
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:25,679
1 0-4.

184
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:42,099
We heard this noise
like a boom.

185
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,864
And when we looked,
there was this cloud of smoke.
That was the explosion.

186
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:50,307
One minute they were having
a wonderful time, and the next--

187
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:54,373
You've no idea what
could've caused this?

188
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:56,971
I don't know what
could've done that.

189
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:03,643
Were they
off-islanders?
I don't know.

190
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:06,623
Can we go now?

191
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:09,422
[ Ed ]
Chief?

192
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:13,488
Chief Brody,
c-can we go, please?

193
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,590
Yes.
Thank you, Tina.

194
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:42,818
We've been over this
a dozen times.
I know, I know!

195
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:46,023
How much longer?
Until we
find something.

196
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:50,091
I'm cold, bored.
You're bored?

197
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:00,575
Holy shit!

198
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,958
Jesus, this is heavy!

199
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:51,123
[ Red ]
Aw, shit. Drop it.

200
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:54,393
Well, what is it?
Drop it.
It's a power line.

201
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:57,230
- Oh, terrific.
- Let me untangle it.

202
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:59,702
We don't want a power
blackout on the island.

203
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:02,797
Let's get out of here
before we do find something.

204
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,981
That's your third
smoke already.
Good coffee.

205
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:18,284
Try a donut.
I want
Fruit Loops.

206
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:20,154
Eat Cheerios.

207
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:22,284
You eat Cheerios.
I want Fruit Loops.

208
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:24,454
You eat Cheerios.

209
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:26,622
What are you guys
up to today?

210
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:28,723
I don't know about him,
but I'm goin' sailin'.

211
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,496
Again?
What else is
there to do?

212
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,767
How 'bout that job you
were supposed to get?

213
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,671
Do I have to?

214
00:26:36,742 --> 00:26:39,768
He doesn't really have to.
I mean, this is his vacation.

215
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:42,712
I wonder where I
left my date book?

216
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:47,273
Good morning.
Everybody up early today?

217
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:50,082
Something going on
I should know about?
Lots.

218
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:52,487
Look,
this kid is 1 7.

219
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:55,788
We've talked about him
getting a job before.
I know, you're right.

220
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:58,125
I wish you could spend
some time with him,
take a half-day off.

221
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:00,187
How can I? I'm in the
middle of a boat accident.

222
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:02,733
I've only got three regular
cops and a secretary.

223
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:05,269
And a deputy who's fallen
in love with the police launch.

224
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,669
And here's another one.
What is it about this place?

225
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:11,505
Everybody's a boat freak.
It's an island.

226
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:13,874
[ Mike ]
I'm goin'.

227
00:27:13,946 --> 00:27:16,676
Hold it.
Wait a minute.

228
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:21,844
I don't want you to go out
too far if it gets rough.

229
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,979
We've had a lot of
trouble out there.
Okay. I'll see you later.

230
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:27,025
I mean, be careful.
I'll be careful.
I'll be careful.

231
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:29,858
Tina, come back here.
No.

232
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,192
Come on.

233
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:35,793
Give me my hat.
Double nope.

234
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:38,199
Come on, Tina.

235
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:56,584
I wonder why they
decided to move?
Too hot in the lighthouse.

236
00:27:56,655 --> 00:27:59,419
Too hot for those two?
I can't believe it.

237
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,460
Aaah!

238
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,667
Ugh.

239
00:28:24,783 --> 00:28:26,808
I called you as soon
as I heard about this...

240
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:29,115
because I hear the bites
are big, really big.

241
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:31,781
Well, after we've looked,
we'll talk.
All right.

242
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:35,054
[ Hendricks ]
Here it is. Could you
move back, please?

243
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:38,119
Could we have a little air?
That's right, move back.

244
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:41,632
Please, just move back.
Thanks.

245
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,260
Jesus.

246
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:56,506
What do you think?

247
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:59,072
First things first.

248
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:01,881
Tip of the snout,
please.

249
00:29:13,932 --> 00:29:16,594
Length, seven and
a half meters.

250
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:19,296
Seven and
a half meters.

251
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:21,464
Correct.

252
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,039
You better check
the bite radius.

253
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:31,139
The what?
The shape
of the mouth.

254
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:34,811
Whale's mouth?
Shark's mouth.

255
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:38,322
What shark?
The shark
that did this.

256
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,620
We don't
know that, do we.

257
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:44,628
That's what we're
here to find out.
And we will.

258
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:48,325
- I can't hear you if
you're going to whisper.
- 1 1 1 centimeters.

259
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,834
1 1 1 centimeters.
68.

260
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:55,305
68.
I have had some
experience with sharks.

261
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:58,672
Oh, have you?
Yeah.
And I think a--

262
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:01,371
I think a great white
might've done this.

263
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:04,415
Carcharodon carcharias?
Right.

264
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:07,748
What makes you think there
might be one in these waters?

265
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:10,014
Well, it's obvious
that, uh--

266
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,852
That a big fish took
a bite out of this big fish.

267
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,825
This is a mammal,
not a fish.

268
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:19,887
Don't quibble with me.
Is it a shark bite or isn't it?
Possibly.

269
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:22,627
Then again, this is
a killer whale.

270
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:25,727
It would have to be a shark
of considerable size.

271
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,872
Look, we know that, that sharks
are attracted by blood.

272
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:35,469
And thrashing about.
And sound.

273
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,014
Sound?

274
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:41,143
Sound like sonar, radar.
They hone in on unusual sounds,

275
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:45,485
irregular sounds,
almost any rhythmic
low-frequency vibration.

276
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:48,788
That means that there
could be one around.
Not necessarily.

277
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,886
These wounds could have
been inflicted 1 5 miles
out to sea or more.

278
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:53,954
None of them were
immediately fatal.

279
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:56,023
Currents could have carried
the body ten miles further.

280
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:58,092
We got a hell of
a tide this month.

281
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,365
Will you just take care
of the crowd, please?

282
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:04,499
Dad?
Mr. Hendricks, will you
take this down, please?

283
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,804
No more sailing today, okay?
And I'd like you to
come back with me.

284
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,371
We came out in my boat.
Yeah, but Andy
will take it back.

285
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:13,280
I got a date.
She'll understand.

286
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:16,878
No, she won't.
Mike, for Christ's sakes,
give me a break here, will ya?

287
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:27,025
...tissue attacks.
It's either a great white
or another killer whale.

288
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,861
Well, I'd like
to know which.

289
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:31,300
Well, it's impossible for me to
tell when the body's like this.

290
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:35,829
This animal has been ashore
for 1 0 or 1 2 hours and
drifting for a day at least.

291
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:38,933
Every little nibbler
in the sea's taken a bite.

292
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:44,244
I know that
dolphins communicate.
I mean, they send signals.

293
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:46,511
You don't think that
if a shark was destroyed,

294
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:48,746
that another shark could,
could come and--

295
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,880
Sharks don't take things
personally, Mr. Brody.

296
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:58,924
Dad, can I
please have my--
No.

297
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:03,559
Hey, look, don't worry about it.
I'll take it back and tie it up.

298
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:06,229
Bye, Mike.
See you later.
I'm sorry. Bye.

299
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:09,535
It'll be okay, Mike. I'll see
you tomorrow, all right?
I appreciate it.

300
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:11,701
Thanks.

301

[ Buoy Clanging ]

302
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:46,005
Larry. Larry,
wait a minute.

303
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:47,510
[ Larry ]
I'm showing summer rentals.

304
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:50,173
I think we have a hell of
a good season going for us.

305
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:53,911
That's swell, Larry, but I
have to talk to you alone.
We're alone.

306
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:59,447
I think we may have
another shark problem.

307
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:06,456
Are you serious?
You bet I'm serious.

308
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:08,465
I've got a half-eaten
whale on the beach.

309
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,501
I've got two
persons missing.

310
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:13,332
This whale has got a bite
out of it about this big.

311
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:15,873
[ Larry ]
Martin, no one has seen
a shark. Be realistic.

312
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,908
I think the selectmen
should know about it.

313
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:20,877
I know it's just a feeling,
but you've got to understand.

314
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,977
Larry, for Christ sakes,
I not only have this attack,

315
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,711
but I've got, I've got
two water-skiers--

316
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:29,447
A tragedy,
but a boating accident.

317
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:31,421
No fin, no sharks.

318
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:34,014
Nothing but
a boating accident.
Their boat's still missing.

319
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:37,858
We have a lot of deaths in
these waters that never turn up.

320
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,823
Are they all
shark victims?

321
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:44,835
Maybe they are.

322
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:48,134
- Oh, bullshit.
- Bullshit?

323
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,800
Is it bullshit, I got
a whale on the beach
with a bite in it this big?

324
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,400
What am I, an ass?

325
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:58,006
When you called me,
I called Elkins and her bosses.

326
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,779
Nothing she saw
is proof of anything.

327
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:06,183
So that means we're not
gonna do anything, huh?

328
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,422
Martin,
don't press it this time.

329
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:16,528
Well, I've got to

I wanted you to really see...

was the concession area,
and take a look at the sand.

God knows who you
could've injured.

What if somebody decides
to sue us? Did you ever
stop to think about that?

497
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:42,291
It could ruin us.
You don't have to worry about
being sued or being ruined,

498

if this turns out to
be what I think it is,

499
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:46,302

be anybody here.

let's not--
Let's not what,
Larry? What?

Let's just forget it.
He won't listen.

502
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:53,468
It's obvious the man
has made up his mind.

503

You bet your life
I've made up my mind.

504

But I'm telling you and
I'm telling everybody at
this table that that's a shark.

505
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:01,978
I know what a shark looks like.
I've seen one up close.

506

And you better do
something about this one,

go through that hell again.

Did he really freak out
on the town beach?
I don't know.

where the garbageman delivers.

go to the lighthouse?
Now, at night?

Tomorrow, maybe spend the day.
My dad left a couple of cases
of beer in the garage.

Is it still there?
Well, it's kind of
vacationing on my boat.

Hey, Mike,
you gonna go?

530

Yeah, why not?
'Cause you might be painting
toilets at the beach.

take my boat out.
