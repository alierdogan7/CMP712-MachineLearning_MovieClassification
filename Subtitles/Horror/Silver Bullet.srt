36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,800
The last full moon of that spring

37
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,700
came a little more than a month 

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,350
before school let-out
for summer vacation.

30
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,109
Our town's long nightmare 
began that night.

40
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:56,000
My beer is Rheingold,
the dry beer.

41
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,829
Think of Rheingold 
whenever you buy beer.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's not bitter, not sweet,

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A real frosty treat,

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,420
won't you have,

45
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,464
won't you buy,

46
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,216
Rheingold beer...

47
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,970
Won't you try,

48
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,597
won't you buy,

49
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,820
Jesus, Arnie !

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Fear the boogeyman?

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yard!

52
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,414
Noone ever been busted...
Gimme a hand.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alright!
What is it that you want Arnie?

53
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,380
I want some Rheingold!

54
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,991
Rheingold beer.

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,621
Oh, shit!

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,500
The killing had begun, 

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,846
but at first, no one knew it.

59
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,891
You see Arnie Westrum was 
a chronic drunk,

60
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,643
and what happened 
seemed like an accident.

61
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,397
The county coroner concluded that 
Arnie had passed out on the tracks.

62
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:55,402
There wasn't enough evidence
to conclude anything else.

63
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:55,944
Yeah!

64
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,000
This is Tarkers Mills,
where I grew up...

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,700
And this is how it looked that spring

66
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,000
A town where people cared about each other 
as much as they cared about themselves. 

67
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:30,687
I was nearly 15 years old 
and my brother Marty was 11.

68
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,941
We'd like to get things started now!

69
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,488
May I have your attention 
please everybody?

70
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,075
We'd like to get things 
started now, we could?

71
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,911
Lot chairs down here, 
come on right down, sit down!

72
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,538
Alright without... further due

73
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:56,046
I'd like to turns things over 
to our own Reverend Lester Lowe.

74
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,299
I'm gonna go, okay?

75
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,260
Alright. Stay close.

76
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,553
Thank you.

77
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,932
And make sure your
brother's allright

78
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,352
"Make sure  your brother's allright."

79
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,312
Marty's a bugger.

80
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,149
Marty was the cross I had to bear

81
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,235
- A real garden snake?
- Hell no.

82
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,446
- He wasn't so bad actually.
- Let me hold him!

83
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:26,118
He was just constantly thrown
in my face by my parents.

84
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,662
- I have an idea.
- What?

85
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,001
Oh you wouldn't.

86
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,670
Oh you would!

87
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,338
Only... That's not...

88
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,674
You know... ??? or anything.

89
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,592
For me?

90
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:48,557
And it never likes, it seems to me, 
to be the very definition of community.

91
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,141
Marty!

92
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:53,562
Marty!

93
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,070
Oh, Janey!

94
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,947
Goddammit!

95
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,996
Come on Jane,
it's just a garden snake.

96
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,249
Look at my hose!

97
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,542
I hate you!

98
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,545
Jane, I'm shocked at you!

99
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,923
Stop it Brady.

100
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,511
Attention!

101
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,222
Look at what!

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Hey Jane!
Do you wet your pants?

102
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,000
Jane I'm sorry.

103
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,897
Oh yes sure!

104
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,274
I didn't mean to.

105
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,985
Oh, no! You never mean to!

106
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,988
I hate you, bugger!

107
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,660
Well. She looks like we got 
her go that time, didn't we?

108
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,453
Shut up, Brady.

109
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,955
You're warped.

110
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,136
It will take a minute.

111
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,013
Come here for a minute,
I have to talk to you.

112
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,598
I told you babe.

113
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,975
It ain't my baby!

114
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,434
- Don't you ever drag me off like that!
- Please, don't say that...

115
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,395
you know it's your baby.

116
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,313
Look, we had this conversation
before, sorry babe.

117
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,815
I have to hear some else,
but I don't know what to do.

118
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,000
It's your oven, it ain't 
my bun you're baking in there.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,152
You have to help me!

119
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,363
Remember the good times.

120
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,624
I want you two to bury the hatchet.
You're being very silly, Jane.

121
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,002
Did you see my knee?
Did you see my outfit?

122
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,920
Marty has apologized.

123
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,841
And you know as well as I do he couldn't 
climb that tree to stop Brady anyway.

124
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,677
You always take his side 
because he's crippled!

125
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,679
But it's not my fault he's crippled!

126
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,932
You just want to be quiet or 
I'm gonna smack you now I mean it!

127
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:58,270
Come on Jane. I'm sorry.
But Brady wouldn't stop.

128
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:35,390
Hey pumpkin! Don't forget to 
help your brother.

129
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,695
Bob, I don't have my keys.

130
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,156
Just a minute, sweetheart.

131
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,284
Don't sweat the small stuff, Janey.

132
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,871
Honey, would you want this?

133
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,665
Come on. Hurry up.

134
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,884
Is uncle Red still coming to visit?

135
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,763
Mum told that uncle Red's
getting a divorce...

136
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,098
Another divorce.

137
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:19,017
And she said he was drunk.
That's your great uncle!

138
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,980
- A chronic drunk!
- He's not.
- He's so!

139
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,667
Janey? Jane you awake?

140
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,360
What's the money for?

141
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,738
A new pair of pantyhose.

142
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,031
Is it enough?

143
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,165
Jane, please take the money.

144
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,000
It was Brady's idea.
Honest-to-god.

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,337
I want to make up.

146
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:35,552
I can get a pair of legs down at 
the pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine.

147
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,053
Here.

148
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,646
Is it true what you said 
about uncle Red?

149
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,230
Yes.

150
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,108
I'm sorry I told you the way I did.

151
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,401
It was mean.

152
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:52,778
It's okay.

153
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,324
Never did much like Sheila anyway.

154
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,662
Maybe I like the next one better.

155
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,790
Suicides go to hell.

156
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:51,003
Especially if they're pregnant.

157
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,172
And I don't even care.

158
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,754
You have to understand it's not 
a normal situation down here.

159
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,340
Alright! What you told me this morning?

160
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,511
Well I'm happy to hear that.
You think it would be sometime this week?

161
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:26,098
Well that's good.
When? And how many?

162
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,558
Hey! Fuck off!

163
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,687
What did he say Joe?

164
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,148
He said they be here by noon.

165
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,776
Maybe that wasn't such a good idea

166
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:41,864
telling that smokey bear from the 
detective division to fuck off Joe.

167
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,616
Well I waited til he hung up.

168
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,077
Jesus Christ, what a mess.

169
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,373
Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass 
if someone rammed it full of radium

170
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,500
and gave him a Geiger counter.

171
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,000
Could be I know a fella 

171
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,755
who's still PO (pissed off) about 
being fined a couple of hundred bucks

172
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:04,428
for that little fender bender
he had back on Ridge Road last year.

173
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:09,016
Could be I know a fat old fella 
who ought to take care of his mouth

174
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:13,770
before someone comes along
and turns it inside out.

175
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,736
We pay our taxes to keep 
this town safe,

177
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,448
and Joe Haller ain't doing it.

178
00:14:25,00 --> 00:14:27,800
Last town report said you were 
in arrears in your taxes, Andy.

178
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,790
Guess you caught up huh?

179
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,919
What are you? Trying to be smart?

180
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,631
Now you boys better turn down 
your thermostats

181
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,300
or you gonna both get 
the hell out of here.

182
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,510
You got me?

183
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,304
Now who's drinking?

184
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:57,147
Hey! It's my man Marty 
in the "Silver Bullet"!

185
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,858
So Marty, glad to be out of jail?

186
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,193
No. I like school..

187
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:01,860
Bugger.

188
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:04,655
Be careful.

189
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,870
Not bad, huh? 
Uncle Red took off the

190
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,039
regular muffler.
Put on a Cherry Bomb.

191
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,040
What's that?

192
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,958
Glasspack.

193
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,087
He said he is making me a new 
wheelchair. A custom job.

194
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,797
But now I don't know,

195
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,258
He's getting a divorce and 
he's in the doghouse with my mum.

196
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,551
For getting a divorce?

197
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,845
Well, it is his third.

198
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,861
Come on, Tammy.

199
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,910
Thanks for coming here with me,
Marty.

200
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,912
I was scared to pass 
her house by myself.

201
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,665
Yeah... it is a little scary.

202
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,379
I mean, I saw her.
All the time.

203
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:07,673
Hey, take it easy.
I know how you feel.

204
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,152
There's something else scary.

205
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:13,285
What?

206
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,440
That.

207
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:18,536
I've been hearing noises out there.

208
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:21,538
Tammy!

209
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:24,539
Get on in here!
Help your mamma with the laundry!

210
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,319
Well. I would well take 
a look myself but...

211
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,120
I think the Bullet would 
get stuck in the mud.

212
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:35,471
You would, wouldn't you?

213
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Yeah sure. No sweat.

214
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,101
Tammy!

215
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:42,571
I gotta go, Tammy.

216
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:45,572
Thanks again for coming home with me.

217
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:51,127
Damn cripple.

218
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,128
Always end up on welfare.

219
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:59,293
I'd electrocute 'em all.

220
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:01,854
Balance the goddamn budget.

221
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:08,855
Oh come on, baby.

222
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,344
Hey Mr. Cutts!

223
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,611
Well Marty!
I see you lucked out again!

224
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,886
Yup. The fill up, please.

225
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:36,083
Want me to check the oil?

226
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:38,497
Yeah sure!

227
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:41,498
Wipe the windshield and check 
the driver's bullshit level?

228
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:48,900
There is a guy sitting in a bar.

229
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,200
A bartender. He says

230
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,300
Hey! Jackass, give me a drink!

231
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,600
So the bartender pours him a drink.

232
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,365
He drinks it.
Sits there for a while.

233
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,366
Hey! Jackass pour me another drink!
So he pours another drink.

234
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,200
The guy gets some loose.....
The guy sitting there says

235
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,700
Hey why do you let him call 
you jackass all the time?

236
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
The bartender says

237
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Oh... Eeyore eeyore
he always call me that.

237
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Give up for a fall, 

237
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
- because you don't stand a chance.
- Yeah

239
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:19,100
Uh, I'll see ya...

240
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:21,191
And I'll... raise you this.

241
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:22,642
You can't bet managers.

242
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:24,443
- You can't bet managers!
- Okay, okay.

243
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,666
I said time and time again.

244
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,471
You can't bet managers.

245
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,765
So ... the yankee.

246
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,066
Piss on the yankees!

247
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,167
Piss on the indians!

248
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:31,268
- Piss on the felix!
- Come on.

249
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:32,269
Piss on the ...

250
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,270
Mom! Coming

251
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:35,343
Wo, Nan.

252
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:38,987
Let him finish the game. Okay?

253
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
- Make it quick.
- Okay.

254
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:44,963
What did you say? Yankees?

255
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:45,964
See your yankee.

256
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,290
And I'll call you.

257
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,291
I got three kings.
Read'em and weep.

258
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:56,875
I got a straight to the queen.

259
00:18:57,003 --> 00:19:00,003
- That's bullshit luck! Bullshit luck!
- That's enough!

260
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,004
That's enough!

261
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:04,505
Hey wait. Can I say...?
Can I at least say good night?

262
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,212
Good night!

263
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:13,300
Good night!

264
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,000
See you later.
See you in the morning.

265
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,500
- I will see you in the morning.
- Okay.

266
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
- Wake me up.
- Okay.

266
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
- No I will wake you up.
- Okay.

267
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Okay.

268
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:28,564
Honey ask your sister to help you.

269
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:29,565
I will be there in a minute.

270
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:30,966
I will...

271
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:34,553
Good night.

272
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:05,025
I don't want you 
drinking around Marty.

273
00:20:05,026 --> 00:20:07,026
Don't be telling me what to do.

274
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:09,027
You've been telling me what 
to do all my life.

275
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Red, I don't care how you live.

276
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:14,701
But he is a very 
impressionnable little boy.

277
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:17,703
You know, you think your only 
responsibility is getting his butt

278
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:20,704
out of the chair and into the tub
and out of the chair and onto the toilet.

279
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:24,535
And you won't realize there's more to 
Marty than him not being able to walk.

280
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,000
- It's so easy for you, isn't it?
- Yeah it is!

281
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You blow in here once a month

282
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and you tell a few jokes
and you have a few beers

283
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and then you wanna lecture me 
about how to raise my son.

284
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Well I'm the one who is responsible

285
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:41,011
for how he feels when 
he sees you like this.

286
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:44,012
And how he feels when you leave.

287
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,290
Red. Marty has enough strikes 
against him as it is.

288
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,382
He doesn't have strikes against him.

289
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,083
I'm scared to death that someday 
he is just gonna give up.

290
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:55,084
He's not gonna give up!

291
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:58,585
Well he doesn't need you 
showing about how to do it!

292
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,435
Another wonderful night here
at sister Nan's.

293
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:22,886
Come on, Rebel!
We gonna bust him up tonight.

294
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,110
We gonna kick some ass.

295
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:27,604
We gonna kick some ass.

295
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Ow!

296
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,551
Bust him up.

297
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:39,552
Bust his chops.

298
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:47,027
Oh yeah!

299
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:49,028
Oh yeah, Rebel. Airplane!

300
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:51,878
Oh! That's it.

301
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,379
Oh that hurts my parts.

302
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:01,268
God. Dig it.

303
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:07,447
I was gonna do something about this.

304
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:15,322
See if you want to come back

305
00:22:15,323 --> 00:22:16,823
and bust up my pots after

306
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,959
I put these rocks up your ass!

307
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,820
Come around bust up my pots 
I'll bust up your ass!

307
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Bitches.

308
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,170
I hope you in there.

309
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:37,571
I hope you in there cos' I'm 
gonna blow your ass off this salt.

310
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Aint' that a hell of a note?

310
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:15,183
Did you hear something?

311
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,477
Haller!

312
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:24,017
Well! You got any leads?

313
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,770
I'm working on it Mayor.

314
00:25:28,332 --> 00:25:29,332
Mayor.

315
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:39,588
David!

316
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:44,589
Come on, come on. Get inside.

317
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,580
- Brady I got it.
- Great.

318
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:18,581
Marty Coslaw,
you get down of that tree!

319
00:26:18,582 --> 00:26:21,582
Supper was ready an hour ago, Dumbo.

320
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:24,583
- Oh, Jesus. I forgot. She mad?
- Yeah.

321
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:27,584
At me for not finding you sooner.

322
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:36,081
You help me with the Bullet, please.

323
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:38,778
I don't let you fall.

324
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,241
Come on.

325
00:27:11,983 --> 00:27:13,983
Hey, Brady! You coming?

326
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:15,913
In a while!

327
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,141
Come on, Marty.

328
00:27:21,802 --> 00:27:23,802
Marty, it's getting late.

329
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,500
We all make Joe Haller dog catch it, 

329
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,000
you know, nothing big,
just a little pools.

330
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,500
Andy, Andy, lighten up.

330
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,600
Let Joe handle the investigation.

331
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,500
Investigation!

331
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,800
This whole investigation 
has been about as efficient as 

331
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
a submarine with screen doors.

332
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,343
I've heard enough out of you,
Andy Fairton.

333
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,000
It's not working.

333
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,000
If you don't shut your mouth,

333
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,280
I'm going to shut it for you.

334
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:10,737
What did you say?

335
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,350
You heard what I said, motormouth.

336
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:18,067
You wanna dance cowboy?
Come on.

337
00:28:18,168 --> 00:28:22,068
Has anyone in here 
seen my son Brady?

338
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:31,000
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

338
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,300
Blessed art thou among women and 
blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

340
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,500
Holy Mary, mother of God...

340
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,000
pray for us sinners...

340
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,000
now and at the hour of our death.

341
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:04,065
Herb! Herb! Wait here Herb.

342
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:06,000
- Is it my boy?
- Don't go up there.

342
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,123
- Is it Brady?
- Don't go up there

343
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:09,149
Brady!

344
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,900
Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked 

344
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,200
that I say a word of comfort
to you, if I could.

345
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:40,000
If there is any word of comfort 
I can give you, it's just this:

345
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,000
that the face of the beast
always becomes known.

346
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,400
And the time of the beast 
always passes.

347
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Nan! How about if 
I take the boy home?

348
00:31:00,147 --> 00:31:02,147
Red...

349
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,192
Okay.

350
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,220
Thank you.

351
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:09,721
Come Marty.
You are going with me.

352
00:31:09,822 --> 00:31:12,222
Hi! Jane see you there.
Alright.

353
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:15,523
- How do you feel?
- How did you feel?

354
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:22,434
They better get that guy.

355
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,100
- Uncle Red?
- Yo.

355
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,300
What if it's not a guy?

356
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:30,713
What do you mean?

357
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:36,334
What if it's... 
some kind of monster?

358
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:44,197
Yeah, what if it's some kind of monster?

359
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:47,951
You know.
Like a werewolf or something.

360
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,952
That's a good one. Yea.

361
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:00,913
Here we go.

362
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:04,314
You know, Tammy told me she'd been 
hearing noises in the greenhouse.

363
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:05,815
Growling noises.

364
00:32:07,113 --> 00:32:10,313
Her father was killed that night.

365
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:16,947
Listen Marty, you have got to 
get this idea out of your head.

366
00:32:18,735 --> 00:32:22,035
Psychotics are more active
when the moon is full.

367
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:25,362
And this guy's a psycho.

368
00:32:26,272 --> 00:32:29,772
When they catch him we gonna find out,
he is just as human as you and me.

369
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:33,000
Okay. Okay.

369
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You all know what groups you're in and
what areas you'll be covering, right?

369
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,773
Damn straight!

370
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:40,300
Groups one through four:
in the woods 

370
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,774
north of the Sturmfuller place.

371
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:45,075
Five and six:
west of Carson Creek.

372
00:32:46,449 --> 00:32:50,000
Now if he comes out in the 
moonlight tonight for a stroll,

372
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
we're gonna get that sorry sucker.

373
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,000
I want you all people to go home!

373
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,600
I don't remember deputizing 
a single one of you!

374
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,900
That's right, Joe!

374
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,500
The only deputy you got is
that fat shitbag beside you,

375
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,900
and neither one of you has done 
anything about solving this case.

376
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,418
We'll catch him.

377
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:06,919
You couldn't catch a cold.

378
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,362
The law has a name for 
what you people are planning.

379
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:16,133
It's called private justice.

380
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:20,134
And private justice is about
a step and a half away

381
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:23,135
from lynch mobs and hang ropes.

382
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,000
Now I may be no J. Edgar Hoover,

382
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,671
but I, am the law in Tarker's Mills.

383
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:35,522
I want all you people to go home.

384
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Don't let this guy scare you!

385
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,024
What's he done since this whole 
thing started but hang his face out?

386
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,000
He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!

386
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Shut up, Andy.

387
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,400
Now don't tell me to shut up.

387
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
Yes.

388
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,437
Shut up.

389
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:05,191
I just came from my boy's funeral.

390
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:08,192
Herb.

391
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:15,000
Herb. I know how upset--

392
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:17,000
How grief-stricken you must be.

392
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,339
He was torn apart.

393
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:22,032
I know that...

394
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:24,000
Upset.

394
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,800
Grief-stricken.

395
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,000
You don't know 
what those words mean.

396
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,500
My son was torn to pieces.

396
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,200
Pieces.

397
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,700
My son was torn to pieces!

398
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:55,385
You come in here and talk to 
these men about private justice.

399
00:34:57,037 --> 00:34:59,337
You dare to do that.

400
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:07,976
Why don't you go out to
Harmony Hill, Sheriff Haller?

401
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:11,600
and dig up what's left 
of my boy Brady

401
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,000
and explain to him 
about private justice.

402
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:18,978
Would you want to do that?

403
00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:26,000
As for me... 

403
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,145
I'm gonna to go out and hunt 
up a little private justice.

404
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:39,776
You heard him.

405
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:41,777
Let's go.

406
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:45,778
Let's go.

407
00:35:51,245 --> 00:35:53,245
Stop!

408
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,944
Andy! Andy! Please don't do this.

409
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,298
Joe!

410
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:03,299
Reverend. This is that community 
spirit you were talking about.

411
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:21,072
Billy. Billy, this is a bad idea.
Don't. Don't do this....

412
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:22,073
Leave me be.

413
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:26,296
No... David No......

414
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:33,465
Please! Please!

415
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,239
Come on, it's frigging time!

416
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,240
They'll have his hide tacked 
to somebody's barn door 
before we get out there!

417
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:12,787
Over there.

418
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:14,788
It's over there.

419
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:23,459
Ok come on up here.

420
00:37:24,986 --> 00:37:25,986
Alright. Alright.

421
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:27,487
Make the other way.

422
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:28,488
I'm sorry.

423
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:30,968
Come on.

424
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:49,811
Jesus, that was close.

425
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:51,812
Come on. Be careful.

426
00:38:19,037 --> 00:38:20,537
God! Help Me!
What is it?

427
00:38:21,738 --> 00:38:23,338
My foot! My foot!
Get it off me!

428
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,039
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

429
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Sure...

430
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:32,897
Okay...

431
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:35,400
Yeah, over here.

432
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Hold on. Hold on.
I'll get it.

432
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,000
Don't you turn your back, now.

432
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,000
Andy there's your yellow ???

433
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,950
Careful Maggie.

433
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:05,870
Damn... Alright...
You gonna go through here.

434
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:08,371
You follow me one at a time.

435
00:39:08,372 --> 00:39:09,872
Right behind you.

436
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:38,014
It came from over there.

437
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:39,700
As far as I could tell,
it came back of us.

437
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,000
It ain't down there, Andy.

438
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:45,266
We'll spread out in a skirmish line.

439
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:48,598
If the son of bitch tries to 
come around us, we'll get him.

440
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:55,601
Holy shit!

441
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:02,596
Come on.

442
00:40:05,551 --> 00:40:06,851
I don't know.

443
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:09,852
My, Bobby, you gonna make 
lemonade in your pants?

444
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:11,853
I ain't scared! Let's go!

445
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:40,725
Where's it coming from?
Over there?

446
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:44,082
No. It's behind us.

447
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,083
I told you you couldn't 
trust this fog.

448
00:40:47,025 --> 00:40:50,025
It's under the fog.

449
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:52,258
What you saying?

450
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
It's right here with us.

452
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:15,953
I can't move.

453
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:18,826
Start backing up, Andy.

454
00:41:19,873 --> 00:41:21,273
Yeah.

455
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,042
My God.

456
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,800
Son of bitch....

457
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:09,000
It's hard at a time like this 
to find the words 

457
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,700
to offer you any comfort.

458
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,600
There is no comfort.

459
00:43:18,788 --> 00:43:21,788
There is only private justice.

460
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,500
The Bible 

460
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,200
tells us 

460
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,532
not to fear the terror that

461
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,500
creepeth by night 

461
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,000
or that which flieth by noonday.

462
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,000
And yet we do...

462
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,500
We do.

463
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:46,000
Because there is so much 
we don't know, 

463
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,049
and we feel very small.

464
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:52,613
Reverend! He was torn apart.

465
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:05,833
No! No!

466
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:33,281
No!

467
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:49,596
Let it end, dear Lord.
Let it end.

468
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:03,181
Oh they canceled the fireworks.

469
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:05,484
It's not fair.

470
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Oh... Look out, world!

470
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,500
Marty the Great didn't
get something he wanted.

471
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:10,608
Stop it, Jane.

472
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,900
I don't see why everybody 
nearly breaks down and cries 

472
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,800
whenever Marty doesn't get 
what he wants.

473
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:17,089
Pumpkin!
What did your mother say?

474
00:45:18,212 --> 00:45:21,212
It's about time you backed off
young lady.

475
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:22,827
It's always my fault.

476
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:24,828
Jane! You won't let up.

477
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:26,929
Come on Nan. Let's get home.

478
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:27,930
I don't believe it.

479
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,200
...by observing the Sheriff's 
curfew and not by leaving town.

479
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,600
...he said the time to be pulling 
together, not to be bailing out.

479
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,000
Now let's hear from Sue Ann Akerksy...

479
00:45:58,233 --> 00:46:00,033
I need a Philips screwdriver.

480
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,500
You know it's not enough that 
the monster killed all those people.

480
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,358
He killed Brady.

481
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:11,191
Now he's got them to cancel the fair.

482
00:46:11,997 --> 00:46:13,997
And the fireworks.

483
00:46:13,998 --> 00:46:17,498
Yeah. And the fireworks.
That's another thing.

484
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:19,638
Where's your mom?

485
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:21,639
She and dad are out back 
lighting the barbeque,

486
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:25,363
Jane's walking around in all these 
new clothes showing off her tits,

487
00:46:25,564 --> 00:46:28,464
acting like nobody ever 
had tits before her.

488
00:46:34,394 --> 00:46:36,394
Let me see if I got this right.

489
00:46:36,495 --> 00:46:38,495
The guy killed your best friend.

490
00:46:39,392 --> 00:46:41,392
Drove your best girl out of town.

491
00:46:41,493 --> 00:46:44,493
And now he's responsible for 
canceling the only carnival we got.

492
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:46,994
Am I lying?

493
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:49,448
No. You're not lying uncle Red.

494
00:46:49,677 --> 00:46:51,877
Well... It's just so happens.

495
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:54,959
I've got something 
that might cheer you up.

496
00:46:56,258 --> 00:46:58,258
Oh! You mean I can see it.

497
00:46:58,263 --> 00:46:59,963
Yeah. It's time.

498
00:46:59,964 --> 00:47:00,964
- Now?
- Yeah. Now.

499
00:47:00,995 --> 00:47:02,065
Cover your eyes.

500
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,266
Oh! Come on.

501
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:04,567
Cover your eyes.
Jesus!

502
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:07,168
I'm bustin' my ass on this steel.

502
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,500
Tadaaa.

503
00:47:25,528 --> 00:47:27,728
Wow.

504
00:47:31,757 --> 00:47:33,757
It's a nice kick Red.

505
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:39,278
- Is that for me?
- Oh yes, it's for you.

506
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,458
Damn. Looks good.

507
00:47:43,004 --> 00:47:45,504
Wow. It's beautiful.

508
00:47:47,505 --> 00:47:49,505
Do you have a pilot's license?

509
00:47:50,558 --> 00:47:52,558
Do I need one?

510
00:47:56,811 --> 00:47:57,811
Red?

511
00:47:59,025 --> 00:48:00,025
Hey!

512
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:01,263
Hey Red!

513
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:06,855
O... Okay. The coast is clear.

514
00:48:06,956 --> 00:48:08,456
- Are you ready?
- O... Yeah.

515
00:48:08,557 --> 00:48:09,957
I feel like a virgin on prom night.

516
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:12,206
Here is the engine start.

517
00:48:15,029 --> 00:48:17,329
- Remember what I told you.
- Yeah.

518
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:19,130
- Now be damn careful!
- Okay.

519
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:20,131
Then you're started.

520
00:48:22,396 --> 00:48:24,396
Push.

521
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:28,269
- Sounds good, does it?
- Yeah.

522
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:29,270
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

523
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:30,271
Shake!

524
00:48:47,278 --> 00:48:49,278
Stop! Right.

525
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,420
Oh! Kid's dead meat.

526
00:48:54,571 --> 00:48:56,571
Oh! Yes.

527
00:49:42,185 --> 00:49:44,185
That was wicked.

528
00:49:45,202 --> 00:49:50,202
Oh... I hope you're happy, because 
you are looking at a dying man here.

529
00:49:50,803 --> 00:49:53,203
This thing goes super super fast.

530
00:49:53,204 --> 00:49:56,204
I know it goes super fast.
And you better watch it.

531
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:58,805
Because if your mother finds out 
just how fast it goes,

532
00:49:58,906 --> 00:50:02,406
I'm gonna end up singing soprano 
in the Vienna Boys' Choir.

533
00:50:02,724 --> 00:50:04,224
I don't get you.

534
00:50:04,525 --> 00:50:06,803
I know you don't.
But listen to me.

535
00:50:07,615 --> 00:50:11,615
I built that for you cos I love you. 
Right from my heart.

536
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,309
And I want you to be careful on it.

537
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,510
Because if you got hurt on it.
It'd kill me.

538
00:50:17,511 --> 00:50:19,511
Let's get to this barbeque, okay?

538
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
- One more piece of rhubarb pie.
- Are you sure about that?

538
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Anybody else like a bite?

538
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,000
- Well go ahead.
- Listen. No. Put it down.

539
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,000
- I've got to go.
- Okay.

540
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,900
- I've had a wonderful time.
- So have I.

541
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,500
I wish it could always be like this.

541
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,000
Maybe it will if you keep inviting
me down when you cook these pork ribs.

542
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:46,311
Okay okay.

543
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,044
Nice to meet you.

544
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,545
I'll see you later Janey.

545
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,046
- Bob!
- Oh! My God.

546
00:50:53,562 --> 00:50:54,562
Okay.

547
00:50:54,563 --> 00:50:57,063
Marty want me to ran my car.

548
00:50:58,064 --> 00:51:00,064
Want me to ran my car.
Stay out of trouble at least that long.

549
00:51:00,065 --> 00:51:01,065
Thank you very much.

550
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,101
Go Go.

551
00:51:26,562 --> 00:51:30,562
Now I said I had something for you,
as I believe you do recall.

552
00:51:31,163 --> 00:51:33,063
Yeah! What is it?

553
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:38,622
You're gonna have the Fourth of July,
but you're gonna have it in September.

554
00:51:39,678 --> 00:51:42,678
Now remember: 
it isn't just the fireworks.

555
00:51:43,051 --> 00:51:47,451
It's so no crazy shithead can stop 
the good guys, if you can dig that.

556
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:48,452
Yeah.

557
00:51:49,048 --> 00:51:50,248
Now stay near the house.

558
00:51:50,249 --> 00:51:51,249
Yeah... sure.

559
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,250
Okay.

560
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:55,408
Save this for the last.

561
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:57,311
It's a rocket.

562
00:51:57,312 --> 00:51:58,312
You'll like it.

563
00:51:58,982 --> 00:51:59,982
Thanks a million, uncle Red.

564
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,500
You're welcome a million, Marty.

564
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,483
Stick 'em in the bushes 
for right now. Okay.

565
00:52:03,484 --> 00:52:04,484
Alright.

566
00:52:05,987 --> 00:52:09,987
Now remember: stay near the house.
Okay?

567
00:52:09,988 --> 00:52:10,988
Promise.

568
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:11,989
Okay.
Alright.

569
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:12,990
That's good.

570
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:13,991
I want you have a good time.

571
00:52:14,992 --> 00:52:16,992
Thank's a lot uncle Red.

572
00:52:18,414 --> 00:52:19,914
Watch out for the werewolves!

573
00:52:19,915 --> 00:52:20,915
Bye!

574
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,201
This is for the good guys!

575
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:13,879
Oh!
Ya.

576
00:56:44,188 --> 00:56:46,188
Oh shit.

577
00:56:54,465 --> 00:56:55,465
Hello!

578
00:56:55,466 --> 00:56:57,766
Uncle Red, this is Marty.
I saw the werewolf last night.

579
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,267
Oh Marty.

580
00:56:59,268 --> 00:57:00,768
I saw the werewolf!

581
00:57:00,769 --> 00:57:02,769
Hey buddy you had a bad dream.

582
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:05,000
It wasn't a dream Uncle Red. 
I saw the werewolf at the fireworks.

582
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,070
It was there.

583
00:57:06,071 --> 00:57:08,571
There are no such things as werewolves.

584
00:57:08,572 --> 00:57:12,572
There is. I saw it.
Uncle Red it was a werewolf!

585
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:15,000
Have some pity on 
your poor uncle, okay?

586
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,901
Jesus!

587
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:20,959
What?

588
00:57:21,153 --> 00:57:22,353
What was that?

589
00:57:24,552 --> 00:57:25,852
Obscene phone call.

590
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:31,079
Marty? You okay?

591
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,100
You've just been sitting
here all morning.

592
00:57:35,457 --> 00:57:37,457
Where's mom?

593
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:40,281
Out shopping. Why?

594
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:42,282
Jane, I gotta talk to you.

595
00:57:43,534 --> 00:57:45,534
About what?

596
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:51,430
Uncle Red won't believe me,
and if you don't help me...

597
00:57:53,032 --> 00:57:55,032
What is it?

598
00:57:57,528 --> 00:58:00,528
He told me something that 
was clearly unbelievable...

599
00:58:01,483 --> 00:58:04,483
and yet somehow,
I believed most of it.

600
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:08,000
And I understood one thing 
with total clarity:

600
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,149
Marty himself believed it all.

601
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:26,595
Marty had seen where the rocket 
had struck home, he said,

602
00:58:26,696 --> 00:58:30,596
And I went out that day looking
for more than just cans and bottles.

603
00:58:31,042 --> 00:58:32,542
Hi, Mr. Thayer.

604
00:58:33,118 --> 00:58:36,118
I'm collecting returnable bottles 
and cans for the Medcu Drive,

605
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:38,119
I was wondering if you had any.

606
00:58:40,027 --> 00:58:44,027
I was looking for a man or 
a woman with just one eye.

607
00:58:44,976 --> 00:58:47,476
Hello, Jane.

608
00:58:47,577 --> 00:58:48,577
Who is it?

609
00:58:48,678 --> 00:58:50,178
It's Jane Coslaw.

610
00:58:53,525 --> 00:58:55,525
Hello, Jane.

611
00:59:04,355 --> 00:59:06,500
I know what you're after, Jane,
and you're out of luck.

611
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,000
Little Toby Whittislaw 
coming here yesterday,

611
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,855
and I gave 'em all to him.

612
00:59:11,156 --> 00:59:13,156
That's okay.

613
00:59:33,879 --> 00:59:36,879
That you, Mr. Fairton?

614
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,520
Got any bottles or cans?

615
00:59:48,521 --> 00:59:49,521
No.

616
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:59,802
- Bye, Mr. McClaren.
- Bye, Janey.
- Jesus!

617
01:00:10,049 --> 01:00:12,049
Gentlemen.

618
01:00:12,127 --> 01:00:13,500
I'm sorry to disturb you at lunch.

618
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,727
I'm collecting bottles 
for the Medcu Drive,

619
01:00:15,928 --> 01:00:18,328
I was just wondering if any of you 
would have seen Mr. Robertson?

620
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:22,339
Oh! Hi Mr. Robertson!

621
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:25,339
I was wondering if you had any?

622
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:27,923
I guess not.
Thanks.

623
01:00:29,657 --> 01:00:33,657
It's my own fault. Believing Marty.
Little ass hole.

624
01:00:41,029 --> 01:00:42,229
Hi! Reverend Lowe.

625
01:00:42,832 --> 01:00:44,832
I'm ready to turn my bottles in.

626
01:00:44,986 --> 01:00:47,986
Hi! Janey. And how are you?

627
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:50,999
Alright I guess.

628
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,020
Oh! It's just my little brother
gets me so mad sometimes.

629
01:00:54,748 --> 01:01:00,748
Well Jane, young brothers 
sometimes do that.

630
01:01:01,549 --> 01:01:05,049
Take your cart around to the garage.
Then bring me your tally sheet.

631
01:02:43,644 --> 01:02:45,644
Having some trouble?

632
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:03,234
Jane! You're trembling!

633
01:03:04,107 --> 01:03:08,107
I don't feel well, I think
maybe I got too much sun.

634
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:12,008
Would you like to come in the 
parlor and lie down for a bit?

635
01:03:12,009 --> 01:03:14,009
No!

636
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:18,010
I have a cold drink?
I have some soda-

637
01:03:19,067 --> 01:03:21,567
I think I should get home
and help my mom with dinner.

638
01:03:21,568 --> 01:03:23,068
- I'll give you a ride!
- No.

639
01:03:27,858 --> 01:03:32,858
Give my best to your brother, Jane.
-I will.

640
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:42,231
Oh, Jeez! What did you do then?

641
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:46,684
I ran faster than I ever ran 
in my life--what do you think?

642
01:03:47,066 --> 01:03:49,566
By the time I got back here,
I really thought I was going to faint.

643
01:03:51,419 --> 01:03:54,419
Marty, what are we going to do?

644
01:03:55,568 --> 01:04:00,034
If we tell anyone -- grown-ups,
I mean -- they'd laugh.

645
01:04:01,263 --> 01:04:03,263
What are we gonna do?

646
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,420
I think I know.

647
01:05:06,648 --> 01:05:11,648
I mailed another letter for Marty the
next day... a third the day after that.

648
01:05:11,749 --> 01:05:15,749
Then, on Saturday, we told 
uncle Red what we'd been up to.

649
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:18,350
His reaction was less than serene.

650
01:05:18,434 --> 01:05:20,734
Holy jumped-up bald-headed Jesus palomino!

651
01:05:20,835 --> 01:05:23,835
- Uncle Red!
- From him I'd expect it.

652
01:05:23,936 --> 01:05:27,936
Sometimes I think your common sense
got paralysed along with your legs.

653
01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:30,869
But from you Jane?
You're miss Polly Practical!

654
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:32,831
You don't understand.

655
01:05:32,882 --> 01:05:35,000
I understand that 
my niece and my nephew 

655
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,800
are sending little love notes 
to the local minister suggesting 

656
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,700
that he gargle with broken glass,

656
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,133
or eat a rat-poison omelette!

657
01:05:41,534 --> 01:05:43,800
He came for me!
I shot it in the eye!

657
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,534
Now he's wearing an eye-patch!

658
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:49,008
I wish I had a tape recorder so 
you can hear what you sound like.

659
01:05:49,592 --> 01:05:52,092
What about the baseball bat
Jane saw in his shed?

660
01:05:52,299 --> 01:05:53,299
What about it?

661
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,200
You know who used to have a
baseball bat like that?

661
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,600
Mr. Knopfler!

662
01:05:56,701 --> 01:05:57,401
So?

663
01:05:57,402 --> 01:05:59,402
It looked like Bigfoot had
used it for a toothpick!

664
01:05:59,449 --> 01:06:01,349
You wanna know what I think?

665
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:04,350
No, we just called you out here
to admire your pretty little face.

666
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:08,351
You better watch your mouth right now,
you're on thin ice with me son.

667
01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:12,449
I think he had a hallucination.

668
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:14,450
Probably a broomstick, or something.

669
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:15,800
It was not!

669
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,700
You want me to show it to you?

669
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,700
Come on, I'm not afraid!
I'll show it to you right now!

670
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:22,000
No no no no no....

671
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,453
I'm a little too old to be playing
"The Hardy Boys meet Reverend Werewolf"!

672
01:06:25,454 --> 01:06:26,454
Jane! Forget it.

673
01:06:26,455 --> 01:06:28,455
Jesus! Ya.
Forget it. Forget it.

674
01:06:28,456 --> 01:06:30,456
Probably have gotten 
rid of it by now anyway.

675
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:32,000
This is dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

675
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Just forget it.
It's crazy.

676
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,500
Do you see your suspect yet, Marty?

676
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,057
Yes, I see him.

677
01:06:41,158 --> 01:06:43,600
Are you trying to tell me 
that a man who took a rocket 

677
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,658
in the eye three nights ago
is out here painting at ...?

678
01:06:46,954 --> 01:06:49,954
He'd either be in the hospital
or he would be dead.

679
01:06:50,304 --> 01:06:52,000
I didn't shoot him
when he was a man.

679
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,304
I shot him when he was...

680
01:06:53,305 --> 01:06:56,305
What, a werewolf? Oh Jesus.

681
01:06:57,997 --> 01:07:01,497
Jane, you don't believe 
this madness, do you?

682
01:07:01,788 --> 01:07:04,788
I don't know exactly
what I believe.

683
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:08,289
But I know that what I saw was a
baseball bat and not a broomstick.

684
01:07:09,212 --> 01:07:13,500
I know there was something strange about 
the way the garage smelled that day.

684
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,500
It smelled like an animal's den.

685
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,713
And I believe in Marty.

686
01:07:17,014 --> 01:07:19,514
You used to believe 
in him too, uncle Red.

687
01:07:22,763 --> 01:07:24,763
Kids!

688
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:15,469
Hey! Marty you wanna go 
to Robertson's for a soda?

689
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:17,670
No thanks.
Think I'm gonna go home.

690
01:08:17,746 --> 01:08:19,446
Okay, see ya!

691
01:08:19,447 --> 01:08:20,447
Yeah... see ya.

692
01:09:33,866 --> 01:09:35,866
Oh my God.

693
01:09:39,646 --> 01:09:44,646
Come on... Please... Come on.

694
01:12:13,636 --> 01:12:15,636
Marty...

695
01:12:15,672 --> 01:12:17,622
I'm very sorry about this, Marty.

696
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:21,200
I don't know if you believe 
that or not, but it's true.

696
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,400
I would never willingly hurt a child.

697
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,000
Please I won't tell any one.

698
01:12:28,441 --> 01:12:31,441
You should have left me alone, Marty.

699
01:12:32,023 --> 01:12:34,023
I can't kill myself.

700
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:39,830
Our religion teaches that suicide is the
greatest sin a man or a woman can commit.

701
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:43,224
Stella was going to commit suicide.

702
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:47,325
And if she had done so, she would 
be burning in hell right now.

703
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,500
By killing her I took her physical 
life but I saved her life eternal.

704
01:12:54,180 --> 01:13:00,180
You see, how all things serve
the will and the mind of God?

705
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:05,254
You see, you meddling little shit!

706
01:13:05,755 --> 01:13:08,300
You're gonna have a 
terrible accident, Marty.

706
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,800
You're gonna fall into the river.

707
01:13:17,246 --> 01:13:22,246
Mr. Zinneman! Help me!
Please help me!

708
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:25,247
Mr. Zinneman! Please.

709
01:13:25,248 --> 01:13:30,248
Mr. Zinneman! I'm in the bridge.
Help me! Please.

710
01:13:31,493 --> 01:13:33,493
Hey! You Marty?

711
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:47,031
Spooky in there, ain't it?

712
01:13:49,385 --> 01:13:54,000
Well I'll tell you it's 
a lot easier to swallow without 

712
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,385
the foaming jaws 
and the hair and the teeth.

713
01:13:57,543 --> 01:13:58,543
Did you talk to the Sheriff?

714
01:13:58,544 --> 01:14:03,044
Yes, after Marty's latest 
thrilling tale of wonder.

715
01:14:03,547 --> 01:14:06,047
But he's had no complaints 
of poison-pen.

716
01:14:06,548 --> 01:14:08,048
See, I told you!

717
01:14:08,049 --> 01:14:09,049
Shut up, Marty.

718
01:14:31,806 --> 01:14:35,806
Jane!

719
01:14:39,407 --> 01:14:42,807
What color is Lowe's car?

720
01:14:43,051 --> 01:14:49,051
Blue. This blue.

721
01:14:54,998 --> 01:14:58,998
Jesus.

722
01:14:59,999 --> 01:15:04,992
That's the craziest goddamn story
I have ever heard in my life.

723
01:15:05,788 --> 01:15:07,788
I know.

724
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,706
Do you believe any of this?

725
01:15:17,532 --> 01:15:20,532
You do, don't you?

726
01:15:20,553 --> 01:15:24,253
Well let's just say I believe
Reverend Lowe oughta be checked out.

727
01:15:24,975 --> 01:15:26,975
That can be arranged.

728
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:29,930
Thank you Joe.

729
01:16:26,341 --> 01:16:28,341
Reverend Lowe?

730
01:18:42,325 --> 01:18:45,225
Can I help you Joe?

731
01:18:50,561 --> 01:18:53,561
I think you better come
along with me Reverend.

732
01:19:02,735 --> 01:19:04,735
But it's not my fault.

733
01:19:36,963 --> 01:19:41,000
Sheriff Haller said he'd 
check him out, and guess what?

733
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,963
No one sees him again.

734
01:19:44,263 --> 01:19:46,263
What do you suggest I do about it?

735
01:19:52,299 --> 01:19:54,299
I want you to turn this 
into a silver bullet.

736
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:09,482
You won't let go of it, will you?

737
01:20:09,483 --> 01:20:11,483
I saw what I saw.

738
01:20:11,584 --> 01:20:13,484
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!

739
01:20:14,803 --> 01:20:19,303
In the made-up stories, the guy who's the
werewolf only changes when the moon is full.

740
01:20:20,004 --> 01:20:26,004
Maybe he's like this almost all the time,
only as the moon gets fuller...

741
01:20:26,005 --> 01:20:27,505
The guy gets wolfier.

742
01:20:29,006 --> 01:20:31,847
Here. Take mine, too.

743
01:20:31,848 --> 01:20:36,848
Why don't you guys tell me how 
this guy Lowe became a werewolf?

744
01:20:38,256 --> 01:20:43,256
I don't know.
Maybe he doesn't know either.

745
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:47,000
I think he's going to come after me.

745
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:54,257
Not just because I know who he is,
but because I hurt him.

746
01:20:54,578 --> 01:20:57,278
But I think he'll wait till 
the moon is all the way full.

747
01:20:59,173 --> 01:21:04,173
When there's no Reverend Lowe at all.
Only the monster.

748
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:12,489
You have gone right 
out of your mind.

749
01:21:14,032 --> 01:21:16,032
Will you do it?

750
01:21:21,224 --> 01:21:22,224
Oui.

751
01:21:24,136 --> 01:21:25,136
Stay!

752
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,840
Hello!

753
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:45,000
My nephew has just discovered 
the Lone Ranger.

753
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,867
And I wondered if 
you could help me here.

754
01:21:56,735 --> 01:21:59,735
You want a silver bullet yeah?

755
01:22:02,261 --> 01:22:07,261
The man uncle Red had gone 
to see was more than a gunsmith.

756
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:13,762
He was uncle Red said, an old-world 
craftsman, a sort of wizard of weapons.

757
01:22:15,763 --> 01:22:18,600
He confirmed the high-grade silver content

757
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:21,763
of my crucifix and Marty's medallion,

758
01:22:22,264 --> 01:22:27,764
melted them down and molded 
them into a silver bullet.

759
01:22:40,225 --> 01:22:44,225
Marty had read all the 
legends about werewolves.

760
01:22:44,462 --> 01:22:47,462
And though they differed on 
several minor points,

760
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:50,462
they all agreed on one.

761
01:22:55,422 --> 01:22:58,422
It takes silver to kill a werewolf.

762
01:23:00,052 --> 01:23:03,752
And we were taking no chances.

763
01:23:05,662 --> 01:23:07,662
Here it is.

764
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:10,738
Nicest piece of work 
I ever done, I think.

765
01:23:11,845 --> 01:23:18,000
It's got a low-grain load 
so it won't tumble.

765
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,845
Oughta be pretty accurate.

766
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:24,631
No, won't shoot it,
it's just a gag.

767
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:30,459
I mean what the heck you gonna
shoot a 44 bullet at anyway?

768
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,460
Made out of silver.

769
01:23:33,696 --> 01:23:35,696
How about a werewolf?

770
01:23:40,256 --> 01:23:43,256
The night of the next full 
moon came on Halloween,

771
01:23:43,257 --> 01:23:46,757
and a happy coincidence left us 
in the sole care of uncle Red.

772
01:23:46,758 --> 01:23:49,758
We are going to New York 
for a week-end.

773
01:23:49,759 --> 01:23:52,759
At least it seemed 
like a coincidence.

774
01:23:53,544 --> 01:23:54,544
Nan! I got the number.

775
01:23:58,849 --> 01:24:00,849
Bye... Bye...

776
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,850
Bye honey.

777
01:24:04,011 --> 01:24:06,011
Thank you. Thank you so much.

778
01:24:06,012 --> 01:24:07,512
Oh! What's this?

779
01:24:07,912 --> 01:24:11,412
It's just my luck to win a romantic 
trip for two after Sheila leave.

780
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:12,413
That's all this.

781
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:13,414
Do you got the ticket?

782
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:14,415
Yeah! Yeah!

783
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:16,416
Okay, now go and have fun.

784
01:24:16,417 --> 01:24:17,417
Bye.

785
01:24:17,418 --> 01:24:18,418
Have fun Bob.

786
01:24:18,419 --> 01:24:21,419
You too Red. Don't let 
those kids run your wagon.

787
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:22,920
No! Don't run those wagons.

788
01:24:22,921 --> 01:24:25,921
Listen! Don't let any trickers 
or treaters in, even if they come!

789
01:24:25,922 --> 01:24:26,922
We won't!

790
01:24:28,025 --> 01:24:29,525
Bye dad, bye mom.

791
01:24:29,526 --> 01:24:30,526
Bye bye.

792
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:31,527
Have fun.

793
01:24:31,528 --> 01:24:33,028
Oh! Listen you kids go to bed early!

794
01:24:33,029 --> 01:24:36,029
You gonna hurt your head bumping,
going in and out like that.

795
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:37,030
Be good kids.

796
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,031
Yeah we will.

797
01:24:42,074 --> 01:24:43,074
Can I tell you kids some?

798
01:24:43,075 --> 01:24:44,575
Sure uncle Red.

799
01:24:44,876 --> 01:24:47,376
Me and Nan were just like you 
guys when we were younger.

800
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:52,718
The bitch of it is, we still are.

801
01:24:54,906 --> 01:24:58,906
Did you really win a trip to New York
from a publisher's clearing house?

802
01:24:58,907 --> 01:24:59,907
No.

803
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:05,619
But the moon is full.
And your parents are gone.

804
01:25:06,963 --> 01:25:09,963
And I did when the subscription
to the party begins.

805
01:25:57,894 --> 01:26:00,894
You'll burn yourself up sometime 
doing that, uncle Red.

806
01:26:01,395 --> 01:26:02,895
Not probably. Will.

807
01:26:02,993 --> 01:26:06,993
If that'd gone off, that would have 
been the end of our silver bullet.

808
01:26:08,493 --> 01:26:10,493
This is too much.

809
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:17,976
You guys are going to bed.

810
01:26:18,157 --> 01:26:19,157
But uncle Red! You said...

811
01:26:19,558 --> 01:26:20,958
I know what I said,

812
01:26:21,012 --> 01:26:24,012
but it's ten to three in the 
morning and it's not coming.

813
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:25,513
The moon's not down yet.

814
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,014
Well it's damn near down.

815
01:26:29,078 --> 01:26:31,800
I'm gonna sit up the rest of 
the night with the stupid gun 

815
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,578
in my lap because 
I promised I'll do that.

816
01:26:33,879 --> 01:26:36,586
But you are going to bed.
And so are you.

817
01:26:36,587 --> 01:26:38,087
What happens if I say no?

818
01:26:39,376 --> 01:26:40,876
Then I'm gonna kick your ass.

819
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,933
It's the werewolf!
I saw, it's the werewolf!

820
01:26:47,934 --> 01:26:48,934
Wait... Wait.

821
01:26:48,935 --> 01:26:50,435
What did you see?

822
01:26:50,436 --> 01:26:51,436
The werewolf.

823
01:26:53,216 --> 01:26:54,216
What did you see?

824
01:26:54,787 --> 01:26:56,287
I was looking at you...

825
01:27:01,762 --> 01:27:04,762
It's okay. And look.
That's all.

826
01:27:39,748 --> 01:27:44,748
A very familiar feeling 
is beginning to come over me.

827
01:27:44,768 --> 01:27:46,668
What?

828
01:27:51,632 --> 01:27:55,632
I began to feel like 
a horse's ass. That's what.

829
01:27:55,633 --> 01:27:58,242
He is out there. I saw him.

830
01:27:58,243 --> 01:28:00,243
I know you did Janey.

831
01:28:00,244 --> 01:28:01,744
Why don't you just go upstairs.

832
01:28:09,329 --> 01:28:11,329
And don't panic.

833
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:16,261
He is here.

834
01:28:17,062 --> 01:28:19,262
Marty, it could be just a fuse.

835
01:28:29,307 --> 01:28:31,307
Shit.

836
01:28:52,095 --> 01:28:53,595
Uncle Red! Watch out.

837
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,112
Jane. Get the gun!

838
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:21,821
Hurry! Marty!

839
01:29:31,773 --> 01:29:34,273
Leave him alone.

840
01:31:07,331 --> 01:31:10,331
I got you.
I got you.

841
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:14,332
Don't worry. He's dead.

842
01:31:16,754 --> 01:31:20,754
Marty, are you all alright?

843
01:31:22,172 --> 01:31:24,172
All except my legs...

844
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:30,550
- What?
- I don't think I can walk.

845
01:31:36,429 --> 01:31:38,429
I love you, Janey.

846
01:31:41,778 --> 01:31:44,278
I love you too.

847
01:31:45,493 --> 01:31:48,493
It wasn't always able to say that.

848
01:31:49,793 --> 01:31:58,793
But I can say it now.
I love you too, Marty... Good night.
