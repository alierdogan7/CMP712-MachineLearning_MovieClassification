4
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:46,159
Is that Joanna Beauchamp?

5
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,410
What's she doing here?

6
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:48,611
Evening, Joanna.

7
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,824
Heading to the big
engagement party?

8
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:53,333
Calm down, Ollie.

9
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:55,051
It's okay.

10
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:02,725
Come on, let's go.

11
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:11,123

12
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:13,686
<i>Freya, come on, let's go!</i>

13
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:15,071
<i>We're gonna be late!</i>

14
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:16,739
I know, I know.

15
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:19,576
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,777
I hate this dress.

17
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:22,078
I should change, shouldn't I?

18
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:23,352
- I better go change.
- Stop it.

19
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,746
You look beautiful.

20
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,817
Plus, you've already
changed five times.

21
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:29,452
If you do it again,
I might have to smack you.

22
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:30,620
Why am I so nervous?

23
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:32,172
It's your engagement party.

24
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:33,623
Of course you're nervous.

25
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:35,124
No, no, it's not that.

26
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:37,158
I just... I feel off.

27
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:39,283
I had the strangest dream
last night.

28
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:42,152
There was this guy, and I
never seen him before,

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,488
but I felt like
I'd known him forever.

30
00:01:44,506 --> 00:01:49,293
And then he kissed me,
and... the world exploded.

31
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:51,178
That is a classic anxiety dream.

32
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,130
You're worried about getting
married, it's a big step,

33
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:55,216
so create a dream scenario
about the perfect guy

34
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:56,348
who doesn't actually exist.

35
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:57,468
But I'm not anxious.

36
00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:59,186
I know Dash is the one.

37
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:00,837
I love him so much.

38
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:02,189
I don't want anyone else.

39
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,007
Which is why I am
so freaked out.

40
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,776
You know about me and my dreams.

41
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,194
You're not psychic.
I might be.

42
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,196
I can read auras.
That's not a thing.

43
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:11,365
Scoff all you want, but
I know I have the gift.

44
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:15,202
You only have one superpower,
and it is your breasts.

45
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:16,520
Mom! Mom!

46
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,178
Where were you?
Scared the crap out of us.

47
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:20,023
In the car waiting for you.

48
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,960
You look beautiful.

49
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,914
I can't believe
my baby's getting married.

50
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:29,032
Mom, it's an engagement
party, not a wedding.

51
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,384
Come on, we have to go.

52
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,392
♪ Take a walk with me

53
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:40,311
♪ On the water

54
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:44,431
♪ Got the power
to make you a believer ♪

55
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:47,551
♪ Take you where
you never been before ♪

56
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,554
♪ Never been before...

57
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:55,559
So am I the only one who finds
this completely exhausting?

58
00:02:55,577 --> 00:02:57,561
And it's not even our wedding.

59
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,563
I will marry you
in Vegas tomorrow if you want.

60
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:00,948
Really?

61
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:02,032
Wherever, whenever.

62
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:03,033
Aw.

63
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:05,068
Oh, and by the way,

64
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,403
I forgive you.

65
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,904
For what?

66
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,256
For being a half an hour
late tonight.

67
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,841
People were starting
to look at me funny.

68
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,908
I wasn't half an hour late.

69
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:13,210
You are always at least

70
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:14,295
15 minutes late
for everything you do.

71
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:15,346
Five minutes.

72
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:18,349
Did I mention
you're worth the wait?

73
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:24,388
Hi, Mom.

74
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:26,357
I was wondering
where you got off to.

75
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:27,558
Hmm.

76
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,059
Mm. Oh, look at that.

77
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:30,978
Why don't you come
back into the party.

78
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:33,063
This is such

79
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,431
an interesting dress, dear.

80
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,483
I like how you just
put it all out there,

81
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:39,102
and screw what other people
think is appropriate.

82
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,405
I really do appreciate
all you're doing for us.

83
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,207
You don't have to
be so generous.

84
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,291
Oh, it's nothing.

85
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:46,627
I want us to be close, dear.

86
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,445
I never had a daughter.

87
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:50,247
And I was always hoping
that when Dashiell married,

88
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:51,448
that she and I would have

89
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,906
the relationship
I always dreamed of.

90
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,418
Yes, I would love that.

91
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:55,919
Good. I hope we can.

92
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:57,304
I just have to say,

93
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:00,424
I know that you were raised in,
well, a certain way,

94
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,393
you know, through no fault
of your own,

95
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,127
and I would really like

96
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:06,563
to help teach you about
etiquette and-and style

97
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:09,183
and all the other things that
you never had a chance to learn.

98
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,434
But we can talk
about that later.

99
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:11,435
I'll take you to lunch,

100
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:12,903
and we'll go shopping.

101
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:14,605
I'll find you a bra
that actually fits.

102
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,107
Ooh, that's wonderful!
Look at that.

103
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:19,159
I hope you choke on it.

104
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:23,197
Mom? Are you okay?

105
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:27,668
Hey.

106
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:28,669
Dude...

107
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:30,087
Don't call me "dude."

108
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:32,122
You'll never believe
what I just did.

109
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:34,375
I made Dash's mother choke,
with my mind.

110
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:35,592
Is she okay?

111
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:36,677
You're totally
missing the point.

112
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,095
Am I?

113
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,496
Ingrid, she basically called me

114
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:41,432
a poor townie with bad
taste and no manners,

115
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,684
and then I wished for her
to choke, and she did.

116
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,269
So...

117
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:46,520
So I'm pretty sure
there's no way

118
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,222
that could just
be a coincidence.

119
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:50,224
Then you don't understand
statistics and probability.

120
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,192
I don't need to;
I have powers.

121
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,477
Choking powers.

122
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:56,030
Congratulations?

123
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:57,698
Oh, my God.

124
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,982
Ingrid, it's him.

125
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,016
Who?

126
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:01,952
The guy from my dream.

127
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:04,288
Okay, that
guy is fairly hot.

128
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:12,246
Are you blushing?

129
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:13,257
This can't be happening.

130
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:14,965
It's not.

131
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,216
You are experiencing something
called illusory correlation.

132
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:18,218
You had a dream
about a hot guy,

133
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:19,970
and now you see a hot guy,

134
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:22,222
so you retroactively turn him
into the guy from your dream,

135
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:24,007
so you can say
the dream is prescient

136
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,375
when it's really
just a coincidence.

137
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:26,560
You think everything's
a coincidence.

138
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,345
Because most things are.
Come on, Ingrid!

139
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:29,596
First Dash's mom and now this?

140
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:30,681
What's your explanation?

141
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:32,316
I would say you're losing it

142
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,351
due to wedding stress.
I need a drink.

143
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:40,157
Stop.

144
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:56,423
Creepy, right?

145
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,292
Yeah.

146
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:01,628
Extremely creepy.
Sorry.

147
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,046
Didn't mean to startle
you, Mrs. Beauchamp.

148
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,132
Dash.

149
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:07,267
Come on, we're at
your engagement party,

150
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:10,020
you're marrying my daughter;
you can call me Joanna.

151
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:11,438
Of course.

152
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:13,440
Joanna.

153
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,726
You know, it's-it's actually
the man who built this place

154
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,111
back in the early 1900s.

155
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:18,729
Archibald Browning.

156
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:20,263
You heard of him?

157
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,766
Yeah, he was a real
son of a bitch.

158
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:24,535
So I've read. He...

159
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:26,286
No, I mean, he was
into some weird stuff.

160
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:27,538
That's for sure.

161
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,323
I mean, the architecture
of this place,

162
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:32,292
it's, uh, well, it's
unique, I'll give it that.

163
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,294
The restoration process
was certainly a challenge.

164
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,663
Well, you did
a spectacular job.

165
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:39,166
Thank you, Mrs. Beauchamp.

166
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:41,218
Sorry. Joanna.

167
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:42,553
Please forgive me.

168
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,338
I... yeah, I grew up
with a lot of rules.

169
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:47,624
Well, you should know that
my daughter does not like rules.

170
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:49,560
And if you tell her
to do something,

171
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:50,761
she'll do the opposite.

172
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,796
That's what I love about her.

173
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:54,731
Well, you've only known her
for a few months.

174
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,350
Check back with me in a year

175
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,268
when you're ready
to strangle her.

176
00:06:58,302 --> 00:06:59,686
<i>I'll have a gimlet.</i>

177
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:01,638
Dirty martini please.

178
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:02,806
Ingrid.
Adam.

179
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:04,441
Hey.
You look great.

180
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:07,161
So good to see you.

181
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:09,646
So, um, this house
is incredible, huh?

182
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,498
I've never actually been inside.
Yeah.

183
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:14,368
Did you know there are all
these tunnels and secret rooms

184
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,753
where they used to have
ritual animal sacrifices

185
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:19,206
and sadomasochistic sex orgies

186
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,674
with people writhing
around naked,

187
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,325
covered in goat blood?

188
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,428
Um...

189
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:27,297
I wrote a dissertation about it.
Oh.

190
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,216
About witchcraft
and occult practices

191
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:30,767
in post-Revolutionary New York.

192
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:34,188
Not about... goat orgies.

193
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:35,505
Right, um... Thank you.

194
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:37,391
Uh, sounds cool.

195
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:39,560
I'd love to read it sometime.
No, it's not that good.

196
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:42,646
Plus, I've been a little
blocked for the past few...

197
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,514
years or so.

198
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,182
Oh, that's too bad.
But, you know,

199
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:47,568
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

200
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:50,520
So, I was sorry to hear
about you and Emma.

201
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,573
I always liked her.
Wow.

202
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:54,691
Bad news travels fast, huh?

203
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,294
It's a small town.
Yeah.

204
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:58,495
Anyway, i-it's okay.

205
00:07:58,529 --> 00:07:59,663
She wasn't really that...

206
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:00,581
Smart?

207
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:02,365
I was gonna say "nice" but...

208
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:05,669
Right.
She also wasn't that smart.

209
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:09,223
What can I say,
ever since you turned me down...

210
00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:10,307
Turned you down?

211
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:11,875
What are you talking about?

212
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:13,510
Yeah, about a year ago.

213
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:14,711
I came into the library.

214
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,513
You helped me pick out
a detective novel.

215
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:19,149
I asked you to have dinner
with me, and...

216
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:21,184
you laughed in my face.

217
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:23,237
I thought you were kidding.

218
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:25,239
Why would I have been kidding
about that?

219
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,941
I, uh... Excuse me.

220
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:30,911
This is Detective Noble.

221
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,529
What?

222
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:34,197
Yeah. I'll be
right there.

223
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:35,866
Uh, I'm sorry. I have to go.

224
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,335
Uh, a couple was attacked
in Melrose Park.

225
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:39,870
Excuse me.
Attacked?

226
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:41,738
Oh, no. Like, mugged?

227
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:44,258
Like... murdered.

228
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:49,379
<i>You okay?</i>

229
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:52,215
Yeah. Fine.
You sure?

230
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:54,217
You just seem off.
Sorry. I just...

231
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:55,418
don't feel that great.

232
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:56,687
Too much champagne.

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,641
Killian?

234
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:03,310
How are you, man?

235
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:09,283
This is a...
little like seeing a ghost.

236
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:10,817
Well, I figured my big brother's
getting married.

237
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:12,452
I should come congratulate him.

238
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:14,571
You have a brother?

239
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:16,406
Yeah. I-I told you
I had a brother.

240
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,774
No, you didn't.
That's okay.

241
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,242
I'm not surprised he
wouldn't mention me.

242
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:20,627
It's been a long time.

243
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,245
I'm Killian.

244
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,332
It's nice to meet you.

245
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:27,668
Will you excuse me? I...

246
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,720
Ladies' room.

247
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,626
What is wrong with you?

248
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,972
I don't know
what I'm doing.

249
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:23,974
I shouldn't be here.

250
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:26,610
I know this is
going to sound...

251
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:29,563
But I had a dream about this.

252
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:31,782
I think I had the same dream.

253
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:32,983
What happened in yours?

254
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,552
What...?

255
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,558
I can't do this.

256
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:18,078
I'm sorry, I don't know
what's come over me.

257
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,238
I have to go.

258
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,109
<i>It was a cat.</i>

259
00:11:58,143 --> 00:11:59,560
I'm telling you, I hit a cat,

260
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,779
not a woman.
Okay.

261
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:04,615
'Cause it looks a lot
like you hit a naked woman.

262
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,912
They interviewed the couple
who found

263
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,046
Bill and Mara Thatcher
last night,

264
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:20,047
and get this:

265
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:21,749
He said the murderer ripped out

266
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,135
Bill's eyeballs and tongue.

267
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:26,003
Ew, Ingrid.
Just ripped them right out.

268
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,588
Enough.
How gross is that?

269
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,707
And Maura's in a coma.

270
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:31,092
They think she's gonna make it?

271
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:36,597
So, did you have
a good time last night, Freya?

272
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:41,769
Holy shit!

273
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,071
There's my clumsy girl.

274
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:45,690
Did you guys just see that?

275
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,075
It-it spontaneously
broke for no reason.

276
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,744
Please, tell me you
just saw that.

277
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,829
I saw you knock
into the counter.

278
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:53,748
It was nowhere
near the counter!

279
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:56,734
Sweetie, are you okay?
You seem a little...

280
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,903
I'm fine.
...nervous.

281
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:01,038
No, I'm not.

282
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,574
I bet I know what it is.

283
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:06,511
- You do? - You're having second thoughts
about the wedding.

284
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:08,963
You're the one having
second thoughts, Mom, not me.

285
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:11,182
I just don't know
what the hurry is.

286
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,634
You're very young,
you barely know him.

287
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:14,635
What's the rush?

288
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:16,971
The rush is she has no idea

289
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:18,973
what she actually wants
to do with her life,

290
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,942
and getting married feels like
doing something with her life.

291
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:22,693
Even if it's the wrong thing.

292
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:24,862
Hey, I am perfectly happy
doing what I'm doing.

293
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:26,280
I like being a bartender.

294
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:29,116
I bring joy and drunkenness
to people in need.

295
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,903
Plus I am in love
with Dash Gardiner.

296
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,104
I've never felt this
way about anyone.

297
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,156
I know this is right.

298
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,574
We belong together.

299
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,992
And I don't care
what you guys think.

300
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,627
Freya, I just want to be sure

301
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:42,112
that you're thinking
this thing through.

302
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,831
Dash travels a lot for work.

303
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:45,082
How are you gonna handle that?

304
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,801
So, you think I'm
cheating on him?

305
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:50,137
What are you talking about?

306
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:51,288
Nobody said that.

307
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,840
I have to go see Dash.

308
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,802
Wow...

309
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,239
I must admit,
I hate leaving you...

310
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:10,825
but I do love our good-byes.

311
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,781
Why do you have to go
halfway around the world?

312
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,332
Can't you be a Doctor
Without Borders here?

313
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,201
I won't be gone that long.

314
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:21,813
I promise I'll cut back
on the traveling

315
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,621
once we're married, okay?

316
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,990
Okay.

317
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:27,324
I don't want
to be away from you.

318
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:29,594
I hate it.

319
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:31,095
Maybe we go to Vegas.

320
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:32,162
We'll just do it.

321
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,340
Or I could come on your trip.

322
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:34,832
We could elope.

323
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,219
You worried you're gonna
change your mind?

324
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,972
I will never change my mind.

325
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,007
Neither will I.

326
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,654
Good morning, Jim.

327
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,656
Morning.

328
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:32,023
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

329
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,992
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

330
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:36,160
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>

331
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,662
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

332
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:40,031
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

333
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:43,000
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura...</i>

334
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:45,403
<i>Mysticum</i>
<i>flamma aperire pictura...</i>

335
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,071
<i>Mysticum flamma aperire...</i>

336
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,047
Hey, Barbie.
What's up?

337
00:16:30,082 --> 00:16:31,782
Hey.
Hi.

338
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,834
I just talked to the doctor.

339
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:37,221
And our last try
with IVF failed.

340
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:39,974
And we don't have enough money
for another round, so...

341
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:42,176
The doctor said, at this point,

342
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:44,145
it would take a miracle
to get me pregnant.

343
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,296
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

344
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:48,015
Is there anything I can do?

345
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:51,185
Well, you studied witchcraft.

346
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:53,303
Do you know any
"get pregnant" spells?

347
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:56,407
Honey, I studied history,
not how-to,

348
00:16:56,441 --> 00:17:00,161
but if there were such
a thing as real witchcraft,

349
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,446
and I somehow had
the ability to use it,

350
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,332
you would be the first person
I would help.

351
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,152
I know.

352
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,874
Wendy...

353
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,328
You don't look so good.

354
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:20,014
Well, I died this morning.

355
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:22,183
So I'm sorry if my
hair isn't perfect.

356
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,834
What are you doing here?

357
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,352
That's a fine welcome you give

358
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:27,888
your sister you haven't seen
in over a hundred years.

359
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:29,106
How much money do you need?

360
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:32,560
Actually, I came here
to save your life.

361
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:40,430
Okay, okay.

362
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,730
We'll see you tomorrow.

363
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,679
Oh, my God, my butt

364
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,564
is like eating my underwear.

365
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,492
Hi.

366
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:47,520
Hey.

367
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,588
Hey.
Um...

368
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,733
listen, I'm really sorry for
rushing out the other night.

369
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,086
I realize I didn't
even say good-bye,

370
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:55,821
which was very rude
of me, and...

371
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:56,923
No, it's okay.

372
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:58,090
You're a cop.

373
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,658
If someone gets
brutally murdered,

374
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,093
you get a pass.

375
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:03,267
So, how's
the investigation coming?

376
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:05,047
Well, actually,
that's why I'm here.

377
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:07,266
I know you know a lot about
occult stuff, and, well,

378
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:08,667
there was this, uh,

379
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,636
weird symbol, uh, in the gravel

380
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,021
where the bodies were found.

381
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:14,273
I thought maybe you'd know
what it meant.

382
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:16,342
Uh, I-I have to warn you,
these are, uh...

383
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,693
these are graphic.

384
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:20,730
Whoa!

385
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:22,114
Yeah.

386
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:23,849
Gruesome, I know.

387
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,702
Do... do you recognize
the symbol?

388
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,788
It almost looks like a mixture

389
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:30,689
of several I recognize,

390
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:33,292
but they're all
from different cultures.

391
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:35,361
This is really strange.

392
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:36,829
Can I keep this?

393
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:38,915
I could check
some books if you want.

394
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,299
Yeah.

395
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,415
Yeah, that-that'd be great.

396
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,052
And, uh, and then...

397
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:46,973
maybe we could, um,
discuss it over coffee?

398
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,174
Sure.

399
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,258
Great.

400
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:52,094
Bye, Ingrid.

401
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:58,234
How you doing, lady?

402
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:00,719
Okay, I have an idea.

403
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:02,154
And it's incredibly stupid,

404
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:03,689
and I can't believe
I'm suggesting it,

405
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:06,325
but do you want to try
a fertility spell?

406
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,860
Are you serious?

407
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:09,362
Look, I'm still a
rational skeptic,

408
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:11,364
but what the hell, it might
be kind of fun, right?

409
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:13,115
Hey, you want to help
us cast a magic spell

410
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,834
to try to get Barb pregnant?

411
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:17,203
Only if I can make hats.

412
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:19,255
I can't believe
I got hit by a car.

413
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,408
That's almost as dumb as
the time I died from syphilis.

414
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:24,427
So how many?

415
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:25,928
Lives do I have left?

416
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,443
I don't know... a few.
Who keeps count?

417
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:29,265
Well, I would,
if I only had nine.

418
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,183
Well, you deal with your curses

419
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:32,718
and I'll deal with mine.

420
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:37,139
Joanna, I hate your clothes.

421
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,430
You know, for a
supposed artist,

422
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:40,026
you dress like a schoolteacher.

423
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,427
I am a schoolteacher.

424
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:43,396
I teach art.

425
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,231
Oh, sorry.

426
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,366
You know, I'm actually surprised
that you let me in.

427
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:49,735
Every time I call lately,
you hang up.

428
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:50,820
Lately?

429
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:53,739
You haven't called since 1972.

430
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:56,158
Well, I got sick of trying.

431
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,960
Plus I've been busy.
I moved to New Orleans.

432
00:19:57,995 --> 00:19:59,712
I opened up this
cute little voodoo shop

433
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:00,779
in the French Quarter.

434
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:03,115
I got married, I got divorced,

435
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,717
I got married again,
I got widowed,

436
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:06,118
I got eaten by a crocodile.

437
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,720
I'm not even kidding
about that.

438
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:10,172
Plus I've been keeping
an eye on you from afar.

439
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:11,457
Even though you hate me.

440
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,726
I don't hate you.

441
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,845
I-I was just mad.

442
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:18,147
Anyway, I haven't seen
you in a century,

443
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:20,132
and suddenly you
turn up half-naked

444
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,102
on my doorstep,
telling me I'm in danger.

445
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:24,503
Care to elaborate?

446
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:26,298
Oh, yeah, I was getting
to that, but first...

447
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:28,274
where are the girls?
We're gonna need their help.

448
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:32,811
No, no. No way.

449
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:35,498
Whatever this is, I'm
keeping them out of it.

450
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:37,033
And no magic while you're here.

451
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,000
House rules.

452
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:39,251
What are you talking about?

453
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:41,754
The girls don't know
what they are.

454
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:43,005
What do you mean
they don't know?

455
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,507
I didn't tell them this time.

456
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,125
How could you not tell them?

457
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,045
I wanted to see if
I could change their fate.

458
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:50,463
You can't change fate.

459
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:51,847
That's why they call it fate.

460
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:52,932
It's fated.

461
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,884
I just got sick of it.

462
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:56,835
The endless cycle.

463
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:59,171
<i>I watched my girls grow up...</i>

464
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:02,308
<i>grow into their gifts...</i>

465
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:06,845
<i>And then,</i>
<i>they die because of them.</i>

466
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:09,315
<i>And before I'm even</i>
<i>done mourning,</i>

467
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:11,951
<i>the cycle starts up again.</i>

468
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:14,520
<i>I'm suddenly</i>
<i>nine months pregnant</i>

469
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:16,188
<i>with Ingrid.</i>

470
00:21:16,206 --> 00:21:18,991
<i>And then soon after</i>
<i>comes Freya.</i>

471
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,293
<i>And once again</i>
<i>my girls grow up.</i>

472
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:23,212
<i>They practice magic.</i>

473
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,797
<i>Then one way</i>

474
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:25,881
<i>or another...</i>

475
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,967
<i>they die by its hand...</i>

476
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:31,370
<i>over and over...</i>

477
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:33,422
<i>and over...</i>

478
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:35,257
<i>and over.</i>

479
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:39,044
<i>I've given birth to them</i>
<i>and watched them die</i>

480
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:43,215
a dozen times and neither
of them's ever lived past 30.

481
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:44,817
I am sick of it.

482
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:47,820
I decided this life,
for once, they'd be normal.

483
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:49,939
So you're denying them
their birthright?

484
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,824
I'm trying to give
them something

485
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:54,893
they have never, ever had,

486
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:57,563
not in hundreds of years
of so-called immortality:

487
00:21:57,581 --> 00:22:00,399
a long and happy life.

488
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,401
And you think you're cursed.

489
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:03,902
At least you got
to have children.

490
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,372
Having children is my curse.

491
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:09,175
You can't hide their
powers forever, Joanna.

492
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:11,544
They're gonna come out
one way or another,

493
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:13,629
whether you want
them to or not.

494
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:22,221
Be right with you, buddy.

495
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:23,973
I'm trying to make
this jar of olives

496
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:25,524
explode with my mind.

497
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:32,148
♪ Never meant to start a fire

498
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:36,869
So you just gonna
stand there scowling at me,

499
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,103
or can I have a drink?

500
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:40,573
What can I get you, sir?

501
00:22:40,607 --> 00:22:42,575
What do you recommend?
I recommend

502
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:44,076
you leave now
and never come back.

503
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:47,613
Why don't you make me
the house special?

504
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:49,281
I hear you're an artist,

505
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:51,917
that your drinks are
practically... aphrodisiacs.

506
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:53,118
Well, but then
you'll just end up

507
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:54,220
all hot and bothered,

508
00:22:54,254 --> 00:22:55,921
and alone and frustrated.

509
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:58,290
I'm already frustrated.

510
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:00,259
Get used to it.

511
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:04,897
So I'm staying in my boat.

512
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:06,298
Docked down at Fair Haven.

513
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:08,184
Little bit cramped,

514
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:10,302
but I think we'll make do.
What are you talking about?

515
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,104
You're coming by
after your shift, yeah?

516
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:15,441
No.
Why not?

517
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:16,909
Because I'm engaged
to your brother.

518
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:18,661
Didn't seem
to stop you last night.

519
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,996
That was a momentary lapse.

520
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:22,615
I bet you have a lot of those.

521
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:23,666
Go to hell.

522
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:45,304
Um... we're not
gonna, like,

523
00:23:45,338 --> 00:23:47,940
awaken any evil
spirits, are we?

524
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:49,225
First of all, this
is white magic,

525
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:50,442
not black magic.

526
00:23:50,477 --> 00:23:52,511
And secondly,
there's no such thing

527
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:55,681
as any kind of magic,
so I'm guessing not.

528
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:57,233
Oh...
Okay.

529
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:58,367
Yes.

530
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,703
So it says here
we should join hands

531
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:03,322
around Barb...
Mm-hmm.

532
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:06,024
and do the chant
while she massages

533
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:07,025
her uterus.

534
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:09,328
Here we go.

535
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:14,366
<i>Nostri incantatores</i>
<i>facit fertilis semen...</i>

536
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:17,035
Uh... "semen."

537
00:24:17,053 --> 00:24:18,087
What are you, 12?

538
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:19,672
It's Latin.
It means "seed."

539
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:22,207
Ew.
Are we doing this or not?

540
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:25,311
Suddenly, Miss
I'm-Too-Good-For-Witchcraft

541
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:26,979
is kind of getting
into the witchcraft.

542
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:28,213
I believe if you do something,

543
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:29,398
you should do it right.

544
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:31,233
Now, come on.

545
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:35,237
<i>Nostri incantatores</i>
<i>facit fertilis semen.</i>

546
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:37,523
<i>Nostri incantatores</i>

547
00:24:37,557 --> 00:24:39,108
<i>facit fertilis semen.</i>

548
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:42,077
<i>Nostri incantatores facit</i>

549
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:43,529
<i>fertilis semen...</i>

550
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:47,750
Shouldn't there be,
like, flashes of light?

551
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:50,169
Or a puff of smoke,
or something?

552
00:24:50,203 --> 00:24:53,038
From the fake spell
we got off the Internet?

553
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,207
I'm bored.

554
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:56,508
You guys want to go
grab a drink

555
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:57,710
at the Bent Elbow?
Yes.

556
00:24:57,744 --> 00:24:59,094
Totally.
Please.

557
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:00,346
Hey.

558
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:11,256
I know you've been angry at me

559
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:12,358
these past hundred years.

560
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:14,059
Why would I be angry at you?

561
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:15,427
You only killed
my eldest daughter.

562
00:25:15,445 --> 00:25:16,729
It was an accident.

563
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:18,397
Plus, Ingrid was reborn.

564
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:20,065
It's never the same.

565
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:21,499
She's always a little
bit different.

566
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:22,701
And every time I lose them,

567
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:24,153
it gets a little bit harder.

568
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:25,621
Oh, don't even act
like your curse

569
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:27,039
isn't way better than mine.

570
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:28,490
Oh, here we go...

571
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,659
Immortality?
Is that really even a curse?

572
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,128
Immortality with
endless motherhood.

573
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:35,047
Do you know how many times

574
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:36,782
I gave birth before they
invented the epidural?

575
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,384
Not to mention soap.

576
00:25:38,418 --> 00:25:39,501
All right,

577
00:25:39,552 --> 00:25:41,086
but even though you're "cursed"

578
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,421
with immortality,

579
00:25:42,455 --> 00:25:44,306
you're not really immortal,
are you, Joanna?

580
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:45,758
I mean, if somebody
wanted to kill you,

581
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:47,509
really wanted to kill
you, they could.

582
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,727
Even with your girls,

583
00:25:48,762 --> 00:25:50,295
the right spell
in the wrong hands

584
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:52,097
could not only kill
Freya and Ingrid,

585
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:54,099
but it could stop them
from being reborn.

586
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:56,134
What are you getting at?
Put out your cards.

587
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:57,853
I don't know where they are.
Yeah, you do.

588
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:06,078
I had a dream about you

589
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:07,279
the other night.

590
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:09,615
Your eyes were green,
they were glowing,

591
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:11,333
because it wasn't you,
it was a shifter,

592
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:12,651
somebody doing evil
in your name.

593
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:14,503
When I awoke,
I dealt a deck for you.

594
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:17,489
I couldn't believe what I saw.

595
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:18,674
I thought I made a mistake,

596
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,709
so I dealt them again,

597
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,211
and again, and again.

598
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:23,629
Every time, the same thing.

599
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:26,498
This can't be right.

600
00:26:26,516 --> 00:26:28,100
Look here. The Impostor.

601
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:29,601
Look at the eyes.

602
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:31,770
And here, the cloak pulled back.

603
00:26:31,805 --> 00:26:34,356
I didn't know what that meant
at first, but now I know.

604
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:36,174
It's the powers that you're
hiding from your daughters.

605
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:37,693
They're about to be revealed.

606
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:39,812
The life you built here, Joanna,

607
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:42,481
it's about to change.
Upheaval, death,

608
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:44,483
destruction, pain,

609
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:46,151
imprisonment, betrayal.

610
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:47,653
It's coming for you.

611
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:50,188
Like nothing you've ever seen before.
Hold on.

612
00:26:50,206 --> 00:26:51,707
Don't get dramatic.

613
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:54,159
You're always so damn dramatic.

614
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:06,221
N... No, no, no, no, no.

615
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:23,272
This isn't happening.

616
00:27:23,323 --> 00:27:25,724
your enemy.

617
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:28,622
The one who can make themselves look like you.
From the lay of the cards,

618
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:30,696
it looks like they don't have
the tools to kill you quite yet.

619
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,581
They're still searching,
so that gives us some time.

620
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,450
Do you have any idea
who it might be?

621
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:36,735
I have absolutely no idea.

622
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:38,587
You said somebody bought
Fair Haven.

623
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:40,506
The boy who's marrying Freya?

624
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,757
No, he's mortal.

625
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,459
How do you know?
Because

626
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,676
I tested him.

627
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,249
Ah!
Oopsie!

628
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,185
Mom, did you just stab
my fiancé?

629
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:55,888
So clumsy. Let me get
a Band-Aid.

630
00:27:55,922 --> 00:27:57,523
Ow!
What is wrong with you?

631
00:27:57,557 --> 00:27:58,590
Nothing. Be right back.

632
00:27:58,608 --> 00:27:59,942
Baby, I'm sorry.

633
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:05,263
<i>Dico me est hoc</i>
<i>creatura humana.</i>

634
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:09,234
<i>The test was definitive.</i>

635
00:28:09,268 --> 00:28:11,787
Dash Gardiner is
just an ordinary man.

636
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:13,322
Only very rich.

637
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:14,656
The cards don't lie.

638
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:16,542
You have an enemy, Joanna.

639
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:18,410
Somebody who wants to hurt you.

640
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:20,496
Somebody whose powers
rival your own.

641
00:28:20,547 --> 00:28:23,382
And they're not gonna stop until
you and your girls are dead.

642
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:24,832
Forever dead.

643
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:46,380
I knew you'd come.

644
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:48,165
I knew you'd come.

645
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:09,302
Why do you look so sad?

646
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,905
Because I've waited 400 years
for this,

647
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,474
and it's not even
really happening.

648
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:26,787
<i>So you're saying she's crazy?</i>

649
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:28,422
I'm saying she's eccentric.

650
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:30,424
Who's eccentric?
Our aunt.

651
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,092
We have an aunt?

652
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:34,494
I told you guys
about Aunt Wendy.

653
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:37,047
I'd always just assumed you made
her up as a cautionary tale

654
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:39,766
about what happens
when sisters fight.

655
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:41,885
No, she's very real.
She's upstairs

656
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:43,470
in the attic sleeping.

657
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:45,856
And you guys should know,
she's... a little off.

658
00:29:49,194 --> 00:29:51,511
She also brought her cat.

659
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:53,847
Bad cat! If you're not careful,
I'm gonna have you spayed.

660
00:29:58,853 --> 00:30:00,487
I'm a little off, am I?

661
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:02,539
Look, I do appreciate
you coming to help

662
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:04,875
with the whole "someone's trying
to kill me" thing.

663
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:08,495
But the one rule I ask you abide
while you're here is

664
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:10,363
stay in human form.

665
00:30:10,381 --> 00:30:11,882
And don't involve
the girls in this.

666
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,300
Wait, that's two rules.

667
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,419
put on some clothes.

668
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,037
Were you not paying attention
last night?

669
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:18,388
The girls are gonna figure out
who they are,

670
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:19,806
whether you want them to or not.

671
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:22,059
Not if we stop this
ourselves first.

672
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:23,560
Now get dressed.

673
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:25,312
I'm tired of looking
at your nipples.

674
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:26,897
Well, then find me something
that doesn't make me look

675
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:29,099
like the old woman
who lived in a shoe.

676
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,235
Do you think it's possible
to have two soul mates?

677
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,386
I don't think it's possible
to have one soul mate.

678
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:35,239
I think "soul mates" is a
concept Hollywood invented

679
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:37,241
to sell tickets
to Meg Ryan movies.

680
00:30:37,275 --> 00:30:39,076
Okay. Do you think
it's possible

681
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,028
to be in love with two men at once?
No.

682
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:44,414
I think romantic love is
a concept Hollywood invented

683
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:47,067
to sell tickets
to Katherine Heigl movies.

684
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:48,252
No, you don't.

685
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:52,572
So who is he?

686
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,541
I just meant hypothetically.

687
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:57,077
Hypothetically, who is he?

688
00:30:57,095 --> 00:31:00,347
Hypothetically,
he's Dash's brother.

689
00:31:00,381 --> 00:31:02,266
Freya, you didn't.
Oh, I know.

690
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,018
I love Dash.
So much. I do.

691
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:07,271
He's... safe and warm
and comforting

692
00:31:07,305 --> 00:31:09,139
and familiar and hot

693
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,141
and funny and romantic
and sweet,

694
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:12,609
and I can totally see myself

695
00:31:12,644 --> 00:31:14,227
spending the rest
of my life with him.

696
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:15,479
Good. 'Cause you're engaged.

697
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,947
But then there's Killian.

698
00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:19,199
Oh, my God.
And I can't explain it,

699
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:20,400
but he is like...

700
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:22,452
lightning bolt passion crazy

701
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:26,039
amazing awesome
soul mate sexual insanity.

702
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:28,158
- Oh, Freya. Oh, Freya. - Don't say
"Oh, Freya." Please don't say "Oh, Freya."

703
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:30,627
I hate it when you say "Oh, Freya"!
Girls,

704
00:31:30,662 --> 00:31:32,579
I want you to meet
your Aunt Wendy.

705
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:36,282
Freya. Hi, I'm sure you don't remember me,
Hi.

706
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:38,952
But we met a long time ago.

707
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,138
And, boy, did we have fun.
Oh, well,

708
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:42,422
please tell me some stories
about Mom

709
00:31:42,456 --> 00:31:43,890
that I can use
against her later.

710
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,175
Oh, honey, I've got a million.

711
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:48,628
Ingrid.

712
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:52,149
You look so...

713
00:31:52,183 --> 00:31:53,900
It's really nice

714
00:31:53,935 --> 00:31:55,319
to meet you. I'm
late for work.

715
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:57,354
I've got to go.

716
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:00,140
What was that about?

717
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:02,025
I don't know.

718
00:32:02,076 --> 00:32:04,578
Tell me about this boy Dash.

719
00:32:04,612 --> 00:32:07,447
He's not a boy, Aunt Wendy.
He's a man.

720
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:09,032
And he's amazing.

721
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,534
But...
But nothing.

722
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:13,670
He's seriously perfect.
I couldn't be happier.

723
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:15,422
Or more conflicted.

724
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:18,425
You love him.
That's very clear.

725
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,677
But you're tempted by another.

726
00:32:20,712 --> 00:32:24,014
Oh, my God. How did you know?

727
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:26,133
Your aura. It's, like,
12 different colors right now.

728
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:28,101
You can read auras?
Uh-huh.

729
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:29,686
I'm very intuitive.
Especially with other w...

730
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:31,304
family members.

731
00:32:31,338 --> 00:32:32,639
I can read auras, too.

732
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:35,025
Or at least I can see them.
Sometimes.

733
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,979
I think.
Freya, there's something you should know

734
00:32:37,011 --> 00:32:38,678
about your Aunt Wendy.
She's what people

735
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:41,198
in the psychiatric profession
call "a flake."

736
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:43,683
And you shouldn't listen
to anything she says.

737
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:45,952
Well, I guess I'm a flake, too.
Must run in the family.

738
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:50,624
You keep messing with my girls,

739
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:53,243
and that curse on your head'll
be the least of your worries.

740
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:55,045
What? It's not like
I levitated over

741
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,713
by the zucchini cart
or something.

742
00:32:56,748 --> 00:32:58,131
We're gonna have
to work on getting

743
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,384
that broomstick out
of your ass, babe.

744
00:33:04,305 --> 00:33:06,206
<i>Mysticum flamma aperire</i>
<i>pictura.</i>

745
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:09,259
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura.</i>

746
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,228
<i>Mysticum flamma aperire</i>
<i>pictura.</i>

747
00:33:11,262 --> 00:33:13,980
<i>Mysticum flamma</i>
<i>aperire pictura.</i>

748
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:16,049
<i>Mysticum flamma aperire</i>

749
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:18,268
<i>Mysticum...</i>

750
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:33,399
If you come with me,

751
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:37,120
I can help you get revenge on
the witch who did this to you.

752
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:51,024
Figured my not showing up
at your boat last night

753
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:52,177
would've been a hint.

754
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:53,345
It's not why I'm here.

755
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:54,863
Conceited.

756
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:56,148
Look, I decided we
should be friends.

757
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:57,834
You want to be friends?

758
00:33:57,954 --> 00:33:59,421
Well, you are
marrying my brother,

759
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:00,710
so in a way we're
practically family.

760
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:02,607
We should at least be friends.

761
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:03,991
Hang out, get to
know each other.

762
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:05,549
Platonically, of course.

763
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:06,944
I don't really think

764
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:09,163
that's a good idea.
I get it.

765
00:34:09,198 --> 00:34:11,499
You're afraid you won't be able
to keep your hands off me.

766
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,034
In your dreams.

767
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:17,088
True, but I promise
to be a gentleman.

768
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:21,092
All right, I'm game.

769
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,960
Cool.

770
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,629
We'll be friends.

771
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,547
You'll marry Dash
then spend the rest

772
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:27,882
of your life wondering what it
would've been like with me.

773
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:28,916
I'm sorry.

774
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,551
Who's the conceited one?

775
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:32,303
At least that's what
I'll be doing anyway.

776
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,724
So, can I get a drink or what?

777
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:38,109
Pal.

778
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:39,560
All right, chill out, buddy.

779
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,646
I'll go make you something.

780
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:44,649
♪ Yeah

781
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,702
♪ Yeah...

782
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,956
Hey, where have
you been all day?

783
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,775
Freaking out.
Why?

784
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:58,162
Wait, did you pee on this?

785
00:34:58,213 --> 00:34:59,964
Yah-ha!

786
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,299
I mean, you don't think...

787
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,218
What, that it was the spell?

788
00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:06,637
The doctor did say
that it would take a miracle.

789
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:09,974
Okay, besides the fact that
we got it off a Web site

790
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,009
that misspelled both
the words "fertility"

791
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,678
and the word "spell,"

792
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:15,680
it's way too fast for
that to have worked.

793
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:18,766
Well, all I know is,
yesterday I wasn't pregnant,

794
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,301
and then we did that spell,

795
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,821
and then Bob and I...
you know... twice,

796
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:26,574
and then I went to sleep
and I had this dream.

797
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:27,775
You were there.

798
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:30,945
You were handing me my baby.

799
00:35:30,979 --> 00:35:32,947
But that was just a dream.

800
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,115
I know it was,

801
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:36,334
and it seems crazy,
but it also feels

802
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:38,085
kind of true, too, doesn't it?

803
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,621
Like, if this were
a movie, right now

804
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:41,789
would be the moment

805
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:43,591
where the girl who thought
she was ordinary

806
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,927
finds out she's actually magic

807
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:49,130
and the power was
within her all along.

808
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:53,017
I, I have to go.

809
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:54,352
Hey.

810
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,854
Well, what are, what
are you so upset about?

811
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,358
Yes.

812
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,642
Drink up.

813
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:02,977
You are kicking my ass.

814
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:07,031
Never play darts
against a bartender.

815
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,350
♪ You got me with your fingers
on my throat ♪

816
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,619
♪ And my head on the floor...

817
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:13,321
See, I, for one, think
this whole platonic thing

818
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:15,873
is going great.

819
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:18,025
It's not, not torture at all.

820
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,629
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

821
00:36:21,663 --> 00:36:24,865

you want me to play ♪

00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:34,392
Keep it friendly, Freya.

826
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,060
Friendly friends.

827
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:40,264
Whoa, hey, ladies' room.

828
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:41,649
Uh, <i>ocupado,</i> buddy.

829
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:42,934
Hello, Freya.

830
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:44,685
Hi, stranger.

831
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,654
You have quite
the sunburn there.

832
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:48,722
You know, I'd put
some aloe on that ASAP.

833
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,659
She said that
you'd be different,

834
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:53,077
that you wouldn't remember me.

835
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,278
Who said?

836
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:55,913
My benefactor.

837
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:58,899
She really hates your
family, even more than I do.

838
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:02,203
She said that I could
have you as my toy,

839
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:03,871
that I could do whatever
I want with you.

840
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,707
You're not the,
not the same Freya,

841
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:09,293
but you're still Freya.

842
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:11,379
Okay, I think
you have me confused

843
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:12,680
with a different Freya.

844
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:14,432
It's a very common name.

845
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,934
I asked you

846
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:20,187
to be my bride,
and you rejected me.

847
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:22,256
All I did

848
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:25,776
was get a little bit angry,
and what did you do?

849
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:30,364
You stuck me in a
desert for 80 years!

850
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,199
Well, guess what.

851
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:34,435
I'm gonna do a lot more
than hit you this time.

852
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,704
Killian, somebody!

853
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:40,124

Stop that!
Somebody!

856
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,278
I said stop that!
Help me!

857
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,779
Quiet.

858
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,331
Oh, God, just let me go.

859
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:48,466
Just let me go, please.

860
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:53,137
My magic is a little bit rusty,

861
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,955
and I was never as
talented as you,

862
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,958
which is why you're gonna be
the one to cast the spell.

863
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,010
Take this.
Uh...

864
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,296
I'm gonna cast a magic spell
with a scented candle?

865
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:04,398
Yes, we are.

866
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:07,151
Okay, take a deep breath.

867
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,469
Repeat after me.

868
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:11,155
<i>Mysticum pictura devorare nos.</i>

870
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:14,475
Yes, you do,
Freya, yes, you do,

871
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:15,943
Now say it.

872
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:19,914
<i>Mysticum pictura devorare nos.</i>

873
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:21,165

<i>Mysticum pictura devorare nos.</i>
What?

880
00:38:41,336 --> 00:38:43,971
Hey, I'm making a vision stew.
I used this once

881
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:46,273
to track down an old boyfriend
of mine who owed me money.

882
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:48,526
Thought we could use it
to find our imposter.

883
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,444
It's in the peyote family,
so don't be alarmed

884

if the walls start breathing.

885
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,314

Freya?

889
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,704
Freya.

00:39:37,715 --> 00:39:39,716
Thanks.

893
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:44,888
I heard you were ready
to talk to me.

894
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:47,808
I know who killed my husband.

895
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:55,232
Oh, my God, what happened?

896
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:56,567
You stabbed me.

897
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:58,402
Plus I think I
ruined your towel.

898
00:39:58,436 --> 00:40:00,270
Okay, it's okay,
I can fix this.

899
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:02,523
I can do a healing spell.
No, no, no, wait, no, no, it's too late.

900
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:03,690
Listen to me.

901
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:04,825
The imposter...
she's real.

902
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:06,777
I was right; she
looks like you.

903
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:08,529
I managed to eat some
stew after she left.

904
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,663
I had a vision.

905
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:10,818
Oh, man, walls are breathing.

906
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:11,915
Holy shit.

907
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,701
Listen, you have to save Freya.

908
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:16,753
The bar where she
works... in the bathroom,

909
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:18,005
there's a picture.

910
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,257
An old lover of
hers wants revenge.

911
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,291
Guys, what the hell is going on?

912
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:22,543
Shh.

913
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:23,710
He's going to
take her in there.

914
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:25,495
He wants to kill
her in the picture

915
00:40:25,513 --> 00:40:26,930
because he knows if he does...

916
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:28,298
She can't be reborn.

917
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:30,684
I wish I could help you.

918
00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:33,503
I don't understand

919
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:34,855
what's happening.

920
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:35,856
We don't have much time.

921
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,608
We have to help your sister,

922
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:39,026
but first there's something
I need to tell you.

923
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,511
It's the truth
about who we are.

924
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:43,680
Please don't tell me we're witches.
We're witches.

925
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:45,899
When you were little, I
put a spell on you girls

926
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,368
so you wouldn't figure
out what we were.

927
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:51,455
It barely worked on Freya,
but it worked too well on you.

928
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,356
Freya knew and you lied to her.

929
00:40:53,374 --> 00:40:55,325
You sent her to therapy.

930
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,461
Oh, my God, she is going
to be so pissed.

931
00:40:57,495 --> 00:40:58,662
Only if we can save her.

932
00:40:58,696 --> 00:40:59,663
I don't believe you.

933
00:40:59,697 --> 00:41:00,864
I am a rational skeptic.

934
00:41:00,882 --> 00:41:02,382
I am a wallflower.

935
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:05,552
Baby, no, you're magic.

936
00:41:07,038 --> 00:41:09,506
Oh, this isn't happening.

937
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,509
Wendy.

938
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,018
Detective Noble.

939
00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:22,686
Joanna Beauchamp,
you are under arrest

940
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,054
for the murder of Bill Thatcher

941
00:41:24,072 --> 00:41:25,689
and the attempted murder
of Maura Thatcher.

942
00:41:25,723 --> 00:41:27,407
You have the right to remain silent.
Wait,

943
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:28,825
Adam, what the hell?

944
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,077
She was positively I.D.'d
by the victim.

945
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:31,495
I'm sorry.

946
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:32,896
Mom.

947
00:41:32,914 --> 00:41:34,448
You have to save your sister.

948
00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:36,399
You're the only one
who can do it.

949
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:38,669
Please don't tell me the power
was within me all along.

950
00:41:38,703 --> 00:41:39,670
The breakfront

951
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:41,071
has a false back.

952
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:43,006
You'll find
everything you need inside.

953
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,543
Ingrid, hurry, please.

954
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:14,731
