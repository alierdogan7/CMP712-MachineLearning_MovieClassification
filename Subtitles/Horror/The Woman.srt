Dá»‹ch: Darkghost, P@nd@111
.: www.phudeviet.org :.

2
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,999
Strumpet.

3
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,499
You're a lifesaver,
you know that, Belle?

4
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,624
Thanks.

5
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,249
Deanna wants to talk to you.

6
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,582
What makes you say that, Belle?

7
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,415
She just was telling me...
- If Deanna wants to talk to me,

8
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,165
she'll come and talk to me.

9
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,499
I'll take one of those burgers
when those burgers are ready.

10
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,624
Are these burgers ready yet, Belle?
- I don't...

11
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,790
I'll check.
- Good.

12
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,624
Hey, keep an eye on Darlin'.

13
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,332
She's after that Clapp boy again.

14
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,999
Deanna.
- Chris.

15
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,832
So, what's on your mind, sweetheart?

16
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,249
I told you! No more kissing.

17
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,499
It is inappropriate.
Do you hear me?

18
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,124
Yeah, I hear you,
you're yelling in my ear.

19
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,540
Can I have my radio back now?
- We'll see.

20
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,290
What are you gonna do, jenny?
- Hold her. - Stop it!

21
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,999
Are you gonna cry
to your Momma, like a baby?

22
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,999
What's the matter, Jenny?
- You wearing diapers?

23
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,290
Let's see it!

24
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,915
Stop it! I'm gonna tell!

25
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,624
Like a girl, you're gonna tell.

26
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,249
You need your diaper changed, jenny.

27
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,332
Ow!
- Shut up!

28
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,332
Diapers? Diapers, Jenny?

29
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,832
I spend as much time as I can
with Ed up at the home,

30
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,290
but I'd like to spend more.

31
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,124
That's understandable.

32
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,499
So what I wanna do is...

33
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,124
I wanna sell it all off,
get myself a nice little

34
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,374
one-bedroom up around there,

35
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,707
so I can be with him
these last few months.

36
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,915
I don't think he's got
much more than that.

37
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,124
Hey.

38
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,999
If you really wanted to sell,
I'm glad you came to me.

39
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,332
So you just come by
the office on Monday

40
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,707
and we'll start drawing up
some papers. Okay?

41
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,874
I can't give you
the world for the place

42
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,249
but I'll give you a fair price.

43
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,165
I know you will, Chris.

44
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,665
It's the good thing
about old friends,

45
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,249
you don't have to worry
about gettin' a lube job.

46
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,582
How'd you do, bud?
- Eight out of ten, dad.

47
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,415
Consistently?

48
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,665
The last one and once before that.

49
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,499
I think I got the hang of it, though.

50
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,624
Gotta hit your free throws
to win ball games.

51
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,082
I know.

52
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,540
That guy's got a major thing for Peg.

53
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,374
He's pretty much a douche.
They went out like one time.

54
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,957
Is that so?

55
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,874
Watch the leather.

56
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,999
So you didn't go in once, huh?

57
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,290
Chlorine makes my hair gross.

58
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,290
We wouldn't want that,
now, would we?

59
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,124
You feed the dogs yet?

60
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,457
Brian'll do it when he gets up.

61
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,915
The dogs can wait.

62
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,749
It's kinda nice when
it's quiet like this, isn't it?

63
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,374
How's the average?
- 7 - 10.

64
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,832
Pretty consistent.
- Good. That's good.

65
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,249
Did you catch anything?

66
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,832
Does it look like I got anything?

67
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,457
I should turn down the ham.

68
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,290
Fine, you do that,

69
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,999
then come along with me, babe.

70
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,540
Me too?

71
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,624
Sure, sweetie. You too.

72
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,540
Follow us, son!

73
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,040
Watch your step.

74
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,790
Okay.

75
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:34,332
I want you guys to move
all this junk from the south end

76
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,457
to the other side of the cellar,
and just sweep up the floor.

77
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,915
Before dinner?
- Yes, before dinner, Peg.

78
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,249
Why?

79
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,249
Because your dad asked you to.

80
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,832
You don't have a problem with that,
do you Brian? - No.

81
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,749
Where do you want us
to move all the stuff?

82
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,124
In the dump trailer.

83
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,124
If it's small and burnable,
put it in the burn barrel.

84
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,749
You're gonna need some gloves.
There's a couple pair in the barn.

85
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,874
Have you fed the dogs yet?
- It's Peggy's turn. I had morning.

86
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,415
Peg?

87
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,749
Fine. I'll feed the dogs.
I'll go get the gloves.

88
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,165
Is there mice down here?

89
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,499
Could be.

90
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,749
Should I get some cheese?

91
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,499
No, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

92
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,040
Belle, you organize
things around here.

93
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,582
With three of you,
it shouldn't take very long.

94
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,207
I've got some things
to do at the house.

95
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,290
Chris?

96
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,374
Why are we doing this?

97
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,707
You'll see.

98
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,040
Trust me on this one.

99
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,874
What's he doing?

100
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,457
Peggy, you scared
the hell out of me.

101
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,207
Sorry. I couldn't sleep.

102
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,290
Well, try. You have
school in the morning.

103
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,499
What's dad doing?

104
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,332
Go to bed, Peggy.

105
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,582
It's late.

106
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,290
Good night, mom.

107
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,165
Good night, honey.

108
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,582
Hey, I don't wanna hurt you!

109
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,999
Okay, so who can tell me
what a scalene triangle is?

110
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,790
Three unequal sides.
- That's right.

111
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,499
But we forgot to raise our
hand again, didn't we, jackie?

112
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,249
Sorry, Miss Raton.

113
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,957
So what other kinds of triangles
are there? Name them for me, guys.

114
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,624
Peggy?

115
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,165
Taking copious notes as usual, right?

116
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,665
Just some notes, yeah.

117
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,665
So what other kinds
of triangles are there, Peg?

118
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,249
Scalene?

119
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,790
Guys.

120
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,457
Please, may I be excused?

121
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,624
Yes. Of course you may.

122
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,915
You okay, sweetie?

123
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,499
Yeah. I just had to come
and get my stuff.

124
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,290
Sorry.

125
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,457
Great shot, Cyndi!

126
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,499
Way to go, Brian!

127
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,790
You're too good.

128
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,665
What's up, Cyndi?

129
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,374
There's something sticky
like glue in my brush.

130
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,207
Let me see.

131
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,999
Gum.

132
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,624
It's okay Cyndi. I'll help you.

133
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,249
Ow! That hurts!
- Sorry.

134
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,207
It's okay. Thanks for trying.

135
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,374
Dammit!

136
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:09,999
Fuck!

137
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:01,040
That is not civilized behavior!

138
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,457
Fuck!

139
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,290
Dammit!

140
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,624
Fuck!

141
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,874
Oh, God!

142
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,165
So...

143
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,665
you like to bite.

144
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:21,082
You can't understand
a word I'm saying.

145
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,790
I get that.

146
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,165
But I'll bet that you could guess...

147
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,165
that I am more than just a little bit
upset with you right now.

148
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,457
So I need to make sure

149
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:38,082
that you understand
just who is in charge here.

150
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:55,832
I've got kids to raise
around here, lady.

151
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:02,540
And disobedience is not something
I want them to witness.

152
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,207
They're very good kids,

153
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:15,790
and I would very much like
to introduce them to you.

154
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,540
But...

155
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,415
if you're not going to be nice,

156
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,957
if you are going
to be disobedient,

157
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,082
then I can't do that.

158
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,790
Now can I?

159
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,540
Plus, I need to feel better
about losing my finger.

160
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,165
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the house for a minute.

161
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:00,665
I'm gonna bring the wife and kids.

162
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,749
And you be nice.

163
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:08,957
Be nice.

164
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,124
I feel better about
losing my finger now.

165
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,624
One shot.

166
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,040
I heard you.
What were you shootin' at?

167
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,499
You'll see.

168
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,457
What is that new tune?
Where is it from?

169
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,540
Korea.

170
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,082
Korea?

171
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,290
I like it.
- Me too.

172
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:58,582
You'll spoil your dinner.

173
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,249
Not a chance.

174
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,957
You say that now.
- I certainly do.

175
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,999
Okay everybody.

176
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,499
Who wants to go down
to the cellar with me?

177
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:12,040
What do you have in there?
A mountain lion?

178
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:16,207
This is a hell of a lot better
than a mountain lion, son.

179
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,624
Dad?

180
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,082
What is this?

181
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,415
God only knows
where she's been living, Peg.

182
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,790
In the woods. In caves.

183
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,040
We're gonna help her.

184
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,040
She needs a big Band Aid.

185
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,040
That's right.

186
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,957
That's the first thing
we're gonna fix.

187
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,624
She's been wounded.

188
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,082
We'll get right to it. Okay.

189
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:50,624
We are all going to have to share in
the responsibility of taking care of her.

190
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,290
Ground rules.

191
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,249
No touching.

192
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,207
I learned the hard way
that our friend here likes to bite.

193
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,124
She bit you?

194
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,749
She took an inch off my finger.
Swallowed it.

195
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,207
Jesus!

196
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,832
What are we gonna do with her?

197
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,415
We're gonna train her, Brian.

198
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,249
Civilize her.

199
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,749
Free her from herself,
from her baser instincts.

200
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,874
This woman thinks
that she is an animal.

201
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,499
And God only knows
how she got that way,

202
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,915
but we cannot have people
running around the woods

203
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,749
thinking they're animals.
It isn't right.

204
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,665
It's not safe.

205
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:32,957
Belle?

206
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:35,957
Yes?

207
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:39,374
Could you run up and
put together a bowl of cereal

208
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,957
or oatmeal or something simple?

209
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,540
She's gotta be hungry.
The only thing she's had to eat

210
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,665
since I captured her is...

211
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,832
Your finger.

212
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,290
And Peg? Go up
and get the first-aid kit.

213
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,582
I wanna see to her wounds.

214
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,082
Okay?

215
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,624
Okay, let's go, girls. Come on.

216
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,999
Better than a mountain lion, son?

217
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,165
Do we really get to keep her?
- We do.

218
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,499
Now, I cannot stress this enough.

219
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,374
For the moment,
everyone keep your distance.

220
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:26,124
What is that, Belle?
Is that oatmeal?

221
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,457
Yes.
- Good.

222
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:28,832
Good. It's nice and nutritious.

223
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,082
just go ahead
and set it down. Okay?

224
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,790
So, Belle,
you're gonna set it down.

225
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,165
But not too close. Good.

226
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:39,957
And now, Brian,

227
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,332
I want you to bring the rake.

228
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,290
Okay. Now push it toward her.

229
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:51,457
Be careful not to spill it.
Come on.

230
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,040
There you go.

231
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,624
Great. Great.
Everybody, that's teamwork.

232
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,957
Okay? Everybody did their part.

233
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,540
See what I mean about
keeping your distance?

234
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:12,249
I guess next time
we need to use Rubbermaid.

235
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:15,207
I'll clean it up. Alright.

236
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,749
If she gets hungry enough, she'll eat.

237
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,457
Okay, look, here,
huddle up. Here.

238
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:31,665
This is our project
and it's a secret one.

239
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,749
Now, I shouldn't
have to remind you

240
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,040
to keep your mouths zipped,
but I'm doing it anyway.

241
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,874
We're all gonna have to share
in chores with this one.

242
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,290
It's the same as
taking care of the dogs.

243
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,957
Someone's gonna have to
clean up after her and so on.

244
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:50,615
Your mother and I
will take care of anything...

245
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:53,457
overly complicated. Right, hon?

246
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,415
Yes.

247
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,540
Okay, then. Well, dinner time.

248
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,207
She may not be hungry,
but I am.

249
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:04,124
Okay. We'll work out
the details later, okay?

250
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,540
Let's go eat.
Is everybody okay with that?

251
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:09,374
Everybody okay? Yeah?
Okay. Let's go.

252
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:41,499
Some salt?

253
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,374
Are you in there?

254
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,290
Well, when I'm sad
I listen to my radio.

255
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:09,165
Wanna hear?

256
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,082
How are things at school, kiddo?

257
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,665
Fine, dad.

258
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,540
You're a good girl, Peg.

259
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:18,207
And I know it's hard
sometimes being your age,

260
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:23,124
but you've got to remember
to look at things on the bright side.

261
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:29,540
You're gonna get
your license soon, right?

262
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,457
Your grades are good, aren't they?

263
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,665
Yeah.

264
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,415
And you're gonna go to college.

265
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,040
Think about that.

266
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,790
Okay, dad.

267
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,999
I love you, kiddo.

268
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,457
I love you too, dad.

269
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,832
Honey?

270
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,082
That woman.

271
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:39,457
Do you really think
we should be doing this?

272
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:00,874
Let's go to bed, babe.

273
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,540
Toby, how are you?
- Good morning. Perfect.

274
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,457
Good morning, Mr. Cleek.

275
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:40,874
Morning, Dorothy.

276
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,874
So, how did it go with Mrs. Oldenberg?
Is she satisfied with the papers?

277
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,290
Signed them right away.
- Fine, that's fine.

278
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,040
You have lunch with Deanna
at noon, court at two,

279
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,415
then a three-thirty
with the oil company reps.

280
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:53,832
Are the Ludlow files ready?

281
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,457
I just have to print out this last one.

282
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,332
Okay, fine. Well, look,
when you're done with that,

283
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,540
just bring 'em on in here,
along with another...

284
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:04,207
cup of mud and
we'll get into it, okay?

285
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:05,915
Thank you, Dorothy.

286
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:37,915
Okay. First some stretching,
then eight laps, ladies.

287
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,582
Tracy, pick up the stretcher.

288
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,582
Not feeling well again today, Peg?

289
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:53,874
There's something going on with her.

290
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:57,207
This last month or so
she's really changed.

291
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:58,915
They do at that age.

292
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,540
Yeah, but you know how
they're all dressing these days,

293
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:04,124
with the short skirts
and the skimpy blouses?

294
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,999
Hadn't noticed it.

295
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:10,165
Point is, that's how she
used to be too, you know?

296
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:11,915
She's a very pretty girl.

297
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,290
She ought to be...
- Flaunting it?

298
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:16,999
Yeah. Dammit. Flaunting it.

299
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,457
Did you flaunt it?

300
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:22,665
I'd have made you pop
your fucking zipper, Mr. Wolf.

301
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:10,749
Hey, Belle.

302
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,040
Hi, Darlin'.
How are you two doing today?

303
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,624
We're fine. You?

304
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:20,707
Good. Yeah, we measured
Bonnie again this morning,

305
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,290
and she has grown
half an inch already.

306
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,582
Can you believe it? God!

307
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:28,707
So, do you wanna barbecue
again some time soon?

308
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,415
I don't see why not.

309
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,957
The weather's been
perfect for it, hasn't it?

310
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:38,457
Yeah. So, your place this time?

311
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,957
The place is just a darn mess.

312
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:52,957
Yeah, well, with all the little ones around,
how can it ever not be, right?

313
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,582
Yeah.

314
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,207
Hey, I gotta run.
See you soon, Vic.

315
00:39:57,458 --> 00:40:00,332
Okay. Listen, maybe I'll pop in
for a coffee sometime.

316
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:01,957
Surprise you.

317
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,707
So, after you finish that,

318
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,915
would you please
send this to Deanna Plujack,

319
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,165
and then we'll send
the initial check.

320
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,457
Okay.
- Will do.

321
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,957
Mr. Cleek,
may I say something?

322
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:45,707
Of course, yeah.

323
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:49,749
It's none of my business, really,
but in this economy,

324
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,749
are you sure
you're not overextending?

325
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:57,374
Have you ever known me to
let things get out of hand, Dorothy?

326
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,499
No.

327
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,040
That is a wonderful perfume.
That's new, isn't it?

328
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,165
You like it?
- I do.

329
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:11,457
I like it very much.
That's very nice. Yeah.

330
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:12,790
Oh, no!
- Oh!

331
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,499
What did you do to your yourself?

332
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,249
Oh, I got too close
to a sweet smelling lady

333
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,290
and she just...

334
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:36,374
Hey! Give me some.

335
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,665
That's not a very nice way to ask.

336
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:42,999
Please, Momma? I love you.

337
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,457
At the table.

338
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,790
What kind of cookie do you want?

339
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,790
I want a little man.

340
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,165
This one?

341
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,332
No.
- Oh.

342
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:03,624
This one?

343
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:04,832
No.

344
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,207
Yes.

345
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,249
Do you think that animal lady
would eat a little man?

346
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,415
I don't know. I don't know
if she's ever had cookies before.

347
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:18,874
So why is she here?

348
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,499
Papa's helping her.
You heard him.

349
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,915
Can I have another one?

350
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,332
Brian!

351
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,624
What do you think you're doing?

352
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,332
Just wanted to see if she was okay.

353
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,124
That what you want me
to tell your father?

354
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:56,374
Want a little man?

355
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:01,665
Hey! Your supposed
to eat the head first!

356
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:05,249
Not me. I chop 'em.
Thanks, sis.

357
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,957
Well, hell, Deanna,
I hated to have to write a check,

358
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,124
it cost me a good neighbor,

359
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:12,207
but if somebody had to,

360
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:15,207
thought I could be of service.

361
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,165
Sure.

362
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:20,124
Sure. No, think nothing of it.

363
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,290
Yeah.

364
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,374
No, Belle and I'd be happy
to help you with one of those bottles,

365
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,707
but we can't tonight. No.

366
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,582
We have a family thing tonight.

367
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:35,915
Okay.

368
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:37,957
Another time, right?

369
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,165
Alright. Good girl.

370
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,290
Okay, I'll be talkin' to you, Deanna.

371
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:44,499
Okay. Bye-bye.

372
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,040
Dad?

373
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,290
Could you not?

374
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,665
I made a...

375
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:11,124
Don't forget about the dogs.
- It's Brian's turn.

376
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,915
Bri?
- On it, dad.

377
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,082
Grab the poop shovel
while you're at it.

378
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,332
Shut up!

379
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,290
You want the goddamn hose?

380
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,582
Hey, girl.

381
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:49,915
Why don't you come out and eat?

382
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,665
You bitch!

383
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:25,457
Peggy, can I talk to you for a sec?

384
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,582
I don't want to be late for next period.

385
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:32,040
I'll write you a note.
Have a seat for a sec.

386
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:43,582
You alright?

387
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,124
Yeah. Why?

388
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,040
Nausea. Baggy clothes.
Mrs. Hindle tells me

389
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,999
you've been sitting out
of gym for weeks now.

390
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,124
Hey, I'm not stupid, Peggy.

391
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,665
Why don't you just
mind your own business?

392
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,165
You are my business.

393
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,457
I'm gonna eat you!

394
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:55,790
Where have you been?

395
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,624
Playing with the dogs a little.

396
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,624
You?

397
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:02,415
Yeah.

398
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,999
I do that sometimes.

399
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:07,832
So, are we ready, Belle?

400
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:09,457
Yeah.

401
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,249
Okay then. Grab the buckets.

402
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,582
So how we doin' today?

403
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,915
I hate to do this to you.

404
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:28,457
But with you I'm not
taking any more chances.

405
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:43,040
We gonna scrub her down, pop?

406
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:46,082
I've never seen or smelled
anything that nasty before.

407
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,582
Well, your mother and I
are gonna scrub her down,

408
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,790
but first you're gonna
clean up her mess.

409
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,457
Me?
- Grab the scoop shovel.

410
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:55,624
Get a rag.

411
00:48:57,083 --> 00:49:00,457
I guess we're gonna have to keep
doing this until we can get her,

412
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:01,957
you know...

413
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:04,207
Potty trained?
- Exactly.

414
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,832
Get.

415
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:10,790
But I can help.

416
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:14,832
Shut the door.

417
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:19,915
Let's go.

418
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,749
Get a bucket.

419
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:32,582
Thank you.

420
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:50,582
Maybe we should let
that cool off a bit before...

421
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:53,249
Belle, we both know

422
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,040
the only way to get something clean
is with good hot water.

423
00:49:57,291 --> 00:50:01,832
Otherwise, we're just
shuffling germs around

424
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,582
if we use cold
or, hell, even luke warm.

425
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,124
Good.

426
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:12,915
See? Good. Look. There.

427
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:16,832
Belle, I'm gonna need
that other bucket.

428
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:19,665
Get the bucket.

429
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,749
Don't look at me
like you're jealous.

430
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,249
This has to be done, Belle.

431
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,540
Would you bring
the other bucket, please?

432
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:59,124
Chris?

433
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,540
Look.

434
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:05,832
Good eye, Belle.

435
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,832
I think I've got...

436
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,290
Yeah. I've got everything
I need down here to fix that.

437
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:14,540
Oh.

438
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,165
That's a good start. Thanks.

439
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:19,999
Okay.

440
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,915
I'm gonna need you to get Brian.

441
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,499
Tell him to go to the wood shed

442
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,165
and I want him to get a log.

443
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:29,499
Tell him to cut it to six feet.

444
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,207
We can't clean her down here,
we're gonna have to take her outside.

445
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,207
Okay? We're gonna need Peg too.

446
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:36,832
Thanks, Belle.

447
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:38,582
You got it?

448
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,957
That's perfect.
It's perfect. That'll do it.

449
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:28,624
Listen, go in the house,
get your mom and Peg.

450
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:30,290
Can I help?

451
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,415
No, you've done enough already.

452
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:51,124
Dad wants you. He wants Peg too.
- Well, go get her.

453
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:55,332
Hey, Peg!

454
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:00,415
Dad wants you!
- Brian! Go up and get her.

455
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:04,582
Do not scream in my house!
- Sorry.

456
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,790
And go up to your room
and stay in there

457
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:08,665
while we are working,
do you understand?

458
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:10,415
Fine.

459
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:04,040
Please!

460
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:12,165
Peg! She's not clean.

461
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:22,957
Please.

462
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:30,707
Ladies, go get the towels
and get that first-aid kit, okay?

463
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:32,290
Let's go.

464
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,665
You're learning.

465
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,540
Dry her off.

466
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:07,082
Is it safe now?

467
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,540
Yeah. Don't worry.

468
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,749
Says the man with nine fingers.

469
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,582
Go ahead in.

470
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,499
Dry as a bone now.

471
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,457
We don't want her
coming down with something.

472
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:42,957
Hon? Give me one
of those cotton balls

473
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,957
and soaked in peroxide, please.

474
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,832
This is gonna hurt.

475
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,540
It buttons here and here,

476
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:24,249
so you don't have to...

477
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,749
undo her or anything.

478
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:30,874
That's great.

479
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:33,040
Why don't you throw it on her?

480
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,957
It's okay, she's not
gonna do anything.

481
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,374
This is just all
new to her, that's all.

482
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,665
She's a little scared.

483
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,332
She has a lot of scars.

484
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:56,165
What do you imagine
she's been doing?

485
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:58,040
Maybe some day she can tell us.

486
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,207
I don't think she likes it.

487
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,040
She's never had a dress
on her before, Belle.

488
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,249
You probably didn't like it

489
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,540
the first time
you had a dress, huh?

490
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,082
There.

491
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:21,624
She looks like one of those
polygamist wives, doesn't she?

492
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,582
Yeah.

493
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,040
Whoa, slow down, slow down.

494
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:17,040
Thank you.

495
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:27,999
Thaaaank you.

496
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:31,999
Thank you.

497
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:43,082
Read my mind, babe.

498
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:47,332
Your kids still giving you a hard day?

499
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,999
No, they're fine.

500
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:54,165
What's with the paper?

501
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:56,790
It's a phone number and an address.

502
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:58,499
Peggy Cleek's parents.

503
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,707
I'm pretty sure she's pregnant.

504
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,665
You are not thinking
of telling them, are you?

505
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,999
Well, shouldn't I?
- Could make things worse.

506
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,540
It's gonna be
very obvious very soon.

507
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,665
It's your call.
I gotta go lock up.

508
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:15,790
I'll be back in a sec.

509
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,499
Hell, it never fails at dinner time.

510
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:29,332
Peg, would you see
who that is, please?

511
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:35,957
I was on the phone all day.

512
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:38,374
Don't make that noise, hon.

513
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:40,374
I don't like that noise.

514
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:43,290
Hello. This is Genevieve Raton,

515
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:45,707
and this message
is for Mr. or Mrs. Cleek.

516
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:49,457
Your daughter Peggy is
a student in my geometry class...

517
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:53,457
Message erased.
You have no new messages.

518
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,582
Darlin', turn that down.

519
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,290
Peggy, what are you doing?

520
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,415
It's time for school.

521
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:01,457
Come on, I'm driving you today.

522
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:06,540
I don't feel so good, mom.

523
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,332
Can I stay home today?

524
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:15,540
Peggy. There is
nothing wrong with you.

525
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:17,290
You got a half-day today, huh?

526
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:18,915
Yep.

527
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:21,957
What are you gonna do
with all that free time?

528
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:30,124
Well, don't do anything I wouldn't do.

529
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,749
Okay, dad.

530
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,165
If I get up I'm gonna be sick.

531
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,207
Fine.

532
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:43,582
I don't want Brian here
alone after school, anyway.

533
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:11,082
Hey, Brian.
- What's up?

534
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:14,249
A bunch of us are going to the movies.
Want to come along?

535
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,040
I gotta head home.

536
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:20,082
I got some stuff to do.
- Okay then. Maybe next time.

537
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:22,624
Sure. Next time.

538
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:24,249
Bye, Brian.

539
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:00,874
Who the hell doesn't like cookies?

540
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:38,624
What the hell
are you doing, Brian?

541
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:41,082
You're in trouble now,
you little shit!

542
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,957
Get out of here! You're sick!

543
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:09,624
I'm so sorry...

544
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:13,665
about all of this.

545
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:39,957
Darlin', go to your room.

546
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,540
Why? I didn't do anything.

547
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:48,124
Honey, this isn't about you.
This is about your brother.

548
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,915
Go to your room, good girl.

549
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:04,415
Do you know what your son did?

550
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,165
Do you want to know?

551
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,040
I'm not sure I do.

552
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:13,915
He didn't think
anyone was home today.

553
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:17,207
So he went down there. With her.

554
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,332
Had her dress off.
Had her naked.

555
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:24,415
He was touching her.

556
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:28,540
And touching himself.

557
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:32,290
If Peg hadn't caught him at it

558
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,582
there's no telling what would
have gone on down there.

559
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,832
Is this true, son?

560
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:42,374
Peggy caught him!
Didn't you hear me?

561
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:46,165
Why the hell are you
asking him is it true?

562
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:49,457
Calm down, Belle.

563
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:51,082
He had one hand on her

564
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:53,165
and the other down
his goddamn jeans, Chris!

565
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:55,457
I'm telling you

566
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:57,415
to take it easy.

567
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:08,124
You better look at me
when I'm talkin' to you.

568
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,332
Is this true?

569
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:22,832
Okay, so no one was hurt?

570
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:29,582
No... What?

571
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:32,374
No one was hurt.

572
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:34,874
He's a boy.

573
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:39,165
He's an adolescent.
Adolescents have urges.

574
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,665
Boys will be boys.

575
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:44,624
You know, now that she's
cleaned up, I have to say,

576
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:46,249
she's not half bad to look at,
you know what I mean?

577
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,165
I can't fucking do this anymore!

578
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:55,415
You can't do this to us, Chris!
Have you lost your mind?

579
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,749
You can't just stand there and smile

580
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,540
when your own son
thinks it's okay to...

581
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:03,040
To what?

582
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,415
You are an officer of the court!

583
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:11,915
She is a human being!

584
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:16,457
Do you know what would happen
to all of us if you got caught?

585
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:19,082
just what's going on with
the goddamn dogs out there

586
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,957
is enough to put you in prison.

587
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:30,499
Anophthalmia, Belle.
It's your shame.

588
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,082
Anophthalmia, remember that?

589
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:34,582
Do you?

590
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:39,290
I never condoned what you did.

591
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,915
Never.

592
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,332
You can't just keep putting
one thing on top of the other

593
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:52,415
and expect to get
away with it forever.

594
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,415
Chris, I...

595
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:59,124
I've had it!

596
01:16:00,083 --> 01:16:01,374
Okay.

597
01:16:03,916 --> 01:16:06,499
So what are you gonna do?
I mean, what is your plan?

598
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:10,124
What? I don't...
I just would like to know.

599
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:13,707
What the fuck you think
you're gonna do about it?

600
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,874
I'm leaving.

601
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,582
I'm leaving you, Chris.

602
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,374
And I'm taking the girls with me.

603
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:35,207
You can have your
little rapist son to yourself.

604
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,207
You're already teaching him every
goddamn thing he needs to know,

605
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:41,457
aren't you?

606
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:46,040
You can damn well
burn together, the two of you.

607
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:49,790
But you are not
hurting my girls anymore.

608
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:52,707
It's over.

609
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,290
Right now.

610
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:57,499
You can't do this to us, Chris!

611
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,749
I can't do this!

612
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:06,832
I can't?

613
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,540
I can!

614
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:19,582
She'll be fine.

615
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,415
She's okay.

616
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:31,040
Get a cold cloth
for your mother, Peg.

617
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:34,915
Peg, let's go!

618
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:54,249
Why don't you answer
the door? See who it is.

619
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:06,832
Miss Raton?

620
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,124
Peggy. Hi.

621
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,415
You gonna invite me in?

622
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:17,707
This really isn't the time...

623
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:19,665
Sure it is, Peggy.

624
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:24,457
Hey, I'm not here to hurt you.

625
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:26,249
I wanna help.

626
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:30,749
You can't help.
- Well, how do you know that?

627
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,457
I just do.

628
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,332
I know doctors, counselors,
all kinds of people.

629
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:42,915
I said this isn't
the time, Miss Raton!

630
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,707
Peg, where are your manners?

631
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:48,790
Hi, come on in.
- Thank you.

632
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,290
Miss...?
- Raton.

633
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,790
Raton. I remember.

634
01:18:55,041 --> 01:18:57,665
Yeah. Geometry.
- Yes.

635
01:18:57,916 --> 01:18:59,165
Geometry. That's right.

636
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:01,915
I met you at Parents' Night.

637
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:04,290
Yes.
- Please, have a seat.

638
01:19:05,416 --> 01:19:07,290
Can I get you anything?

639
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:10,207
Are you thirsty?
Would you like some...

640
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:12,624
Soda pop or coffee, nothing?

641
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,915
I'm fine, thank you.
- Okay.

642
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:20,165
May I speak with you and
your wife privately, Mr. Cleek?

643
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:23,332
Please, call me Chris, Miss Raton.

644
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:24,499
Chris.

645
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,540
And you are...?

646
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:31,040
Genevieve.

647
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:34,249
Genevieve.
It's a beautiful name.

648
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,124
She's really not feeling very well.

649
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,624
She's having herself
a little power nap.

650
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:46,540
So this is about Peg, I gather?

651
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:47,999
Yes.

652
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:50,665
Then I suppose she should hear it.

653
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:53,915
My son as well.

654
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:57,999
We have no secrets
in this family, Miss Raton.

655
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,707
Brian?

656
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:01,665
Come here, son.

657
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:15,040
I've observed some...

658
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:19,249
distressing behavior
as of late, Mr. Cleek.

659
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:23,540
Chris.

660
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:26,665
Peggy isn't looking well.

661
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:32,332
She's had to rush out to use the ladies
rest room several times during class.

662
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:35,082
Her studies are off,

663
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:38,040
and she's taken to wearing clothes
that are much too big for her.

664
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:44,165
Well, she does like
to wear my sweats.

665
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:49,332
Does Peggy have a boyfriend,
do you know, Mr. Cleek?

666
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:51,165
No.

667
01:20:53,291 --> 01:20:55,749
And I would know if she did.

668
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:00,124
Why?

669
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:06,207
I believe that Peggy
is pregnant, Mr. Cleek.

670
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:13,665
Pregnant.
- I am not!

671
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:22,082
What makes you think that
Peggy is pregnant, Miss Raton?

672
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:24,499
Well, she's showing, Mr. Cleek.

673
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:28,332
Not very much right now,
but that won't last much longer.

674
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:40,457
Do any of your colleagues
concur with this opinion, Miss Raton?

675
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:42,999
I wouldn't know.
I haven't discussed it with them.

676
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:44,582
I thought it best

677
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,915
to come directly
to you and your wife.

678
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:49,374
It was good of you to do so.

679
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,915
I thought teachers
were supposed to listen,

680
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:01,874
but you're not very good at listening,
are you, Miss Raton?

681
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:04,915
Because I told you
Peggy does not have a boyfriend

682
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:06,415
and that if she did
I would know about it.

683
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:08,374
Did I not say that?

684
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:10,832
Well, yes, but...

685
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:13,040
So you're accusing Brian?

686
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:19,249
He's just a boy.
- Absolutely not!

687
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,040
So you're accusing me?

688
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:22,624
No.

689
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:24,124
No, I...

690
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:26,582
No. You're accusing me?

691
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:27,582
Dad!

692
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:31,957
You come to my house and you
accuse me of something like that.

693
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,040
I said nothing
of the sort, Mr. Cleek.

694
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:35,999
I know you didn't say
anything of the sort.

695
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,832
It's what you haven't said.

696
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:39,832
You think I'm stupid?

697
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:42,415
Do you think I'm stupid?

698
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,040
No.
- Miss Raton?

699
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:47,957
Yes?

700
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:50,957
You don't really...

701
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:55,582
think that I would want to
miss out on heaven, do you?

702
01:23:01,166 --> 01:23:02,749
Hey, Brian?

703
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:04,957
Would you get the rope?

704
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:19,040
Please!

705
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,082
Daddy, please stop!

706
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:25,165
Daddy, please, she's my teacher!

707
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:28,040
Please, she's my friend, daddy!
- Your friend?

708
01:23:28,291 --> 01:23:29,874
Your friend, is that what you said?

709
01:23:30,125 --> 01:23:31,874
Well, your friend just
came to expose you

710
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:34,165
for the little slut whore that you are!

711
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:36,832
Daddy, you can't!

712
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,957
You can't! You can't! You can't!

713
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:46,457
I am so fucking sick

714
01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:50,749
of "you can't" from
the women in this family!

715
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:51,999
Your mother,

716
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:55,665
your idiot sisters, you!

717
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,249
Please. Let me go.

718
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,874
I swear I won't tell anyone.

719
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:02,415
Yeah, I know you won't.

720
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:09,790
You know what?

721
01:24:10,916 --> 01:24:12,915
Make that all women.

722
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:17,165
Make that all women.
Because you're leeches,

723
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:21,540
every one of you suck a man dry,

724
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:26,332
who works like a dog every day
and you suck him dry!

725
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:29,249
Chris...

726
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:32,082
Stop it!
- Shut up, lady!

727
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:38,832
Do you know what
you're good for, Peg?

728
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:40,624
Do you?

729
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:44,499
You and every other whining bitch,

730
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:49,040
you're good for one thing
and one thing only.

731
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:53,082
And half the time
you're miserable at that.

732
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:56,415
You think I don't know who you are?

733
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:58,582
You think I don't know?

734
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:03,124
You're no different than that thing,
that thing in the cellar.

735
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:05,790
That's where you all belong!

736
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:08,040
Each and every cunting one of you!

737
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:22,457
No!

738
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:24,540
Brian,

739
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,665
I lost my composure there.

740
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:29,749
I got a little emotional.

741
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,915
Never let emotions
get the best of you. Okay?

742
01:25:33,166 --> 01:25:34,582
Okay.
- Good.

743
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,832
I want you to get the door, son.

744
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:41,249
We'll handle this one right away.

745
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,332
No! No!

746
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:50,374
No, please, help me!

747
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:52,332
I swear I won't tell anyone.

748
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,749
Hold on to her!

749
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:10,624
I got her, dad.

750
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:15,374
Peggy?

751
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:51,040
Momma, what's
happening to the doggies?

752
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,624
It's okay, come here, honey.

753
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:11,124
Go to your room and lock the door.

754
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,749
That's a very bad idea.

755
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:39,249
Bad idea.

756
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:46,540
Can you say Anophthalmia?

757
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:54,790
Oh, yeah, sister,
let's see what you can do!

758
01:27:56,291 --> 01:27:57,374
Anophthalmia!

759
01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:03,040
Peggy?

760
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:04,999
What have you done?

761
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:39,332
She doesn't even look
real anymore, does she, dad?

762
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:41,249
She does to me, son.

763
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:03,790
Listen, I want you
to go to the house,

764
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,165
wake your mom up.

765
01:31:05,416 --> 01:31:08,499
Get some cleaning supplies,
some lawn leaf bags, okay?

766
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,832
They're never gonna
be able to eat all this.

767
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:13,082
Sure, dad.

768
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,290
Get me a soda pop
while you're at it.

769
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,332
Getjacked up on that caffeine.

770
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:09,499
Darlin'!

771
01:34:06,333 --> 01:34:07,790
Stay with me, okay?

772
01:34:08,041 --> 01:34:09,790
I want mommy!

773
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:11,790
Shit! He's got his keys!

774
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,874
Can you hold this for me?
Don't drop that.

775
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:20,915
Dammit!

776
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:23,665
Shit!

777
01:34:23,916 --> 01:34:25,790
Hey, it's the lady and sister.

778
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:36,290
Darlin'!

779
