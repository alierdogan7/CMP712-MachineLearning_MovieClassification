were not perfect enough
for his experiments, he said.

146

with other bodies,

147

as to where and how we got them.

here's the final touch.

The brain you stole, Fritz. Yes.

198
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,056
Think of it. The brain of a dead man,

199
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:18,226
waiting to live again in a
body I made with my own hands.

you said I was crazy.

we'll see about that.

but I insist.

Please.

269
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,987
Dr. Waldman, I learned a great
deal from you at the university

270
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,199
about the violet ray,
the ultraviolet ray,

271
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,911
which you said was the
highest color in the spectrum.

272
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,205
You were wrong.

273
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,960
Here in this machinery,
I have gone beyond that.

274
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:42,092
I have discovered the great ray that
first brought life into the world.

275
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,135
Oh. And your proof?

276
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,430
Tonight you shall
have your proof.

277
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,435
At first, I experimented
only with dead animals

278
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,898
and then a human heart, which
I kept beating for three weeks.

279
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,275
But now,

280
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,238
I'm going to turn
that ray on that body

281
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,407
and endow it with life.

282
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,452
And you really believe that
you can bring life to the dead?

283
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,497
That body is not dead.

284
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,582
It has never lived.

285
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,252
I created it.

286
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,548
I made it with my own hands from
the bodies I took from graves,

287
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,758
from the gallows, anywhere!

288
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,805

about that, but what do you want?

want to know is,

356
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,123
when will the wedding be,
if you please?

357
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,417
Unless Henry
comes to his senses,

358
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,252
there'll be
no wedding at all.

359
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,088
But, Herr Baron, the
village is already prepared!

360
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,923
Well, tell them
to unprepare.

361
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,551
Oh, but such
a lovely bride.

362
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,637
Such a fine young man, the
very image of his father.

363
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,930
Heaven forbid.

364
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,890
But, sir,
everything is ready!

365
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,269
I know that. Don't keep
on saying so, you idiot.

366
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,604
There's nothing
to cry about.

367
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,857
Good day, Miss Elizabeth. (COUGHS)

368
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,817
Good day,
Herr Moritz.

369
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,402
Good day, Herr Vogel.

370
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,072
Good day, Herr Baron.

371
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,200
And good riddance
to you.

372
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,954
There you are.
You see how it is.

373
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,206
The whole village
is kept waiting.

374
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,292
The bride is
kept waiting.

375
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,919
And I am kept waiting.

376
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,630
Henry must come home, if
I have to fetch him myself.

377
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,424
No, no, Baron. What
do you mean, "No, no"?

378
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,508
What about his work?

379
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,469
Stuff and nonsense!
What about his wedding?

380
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,929
There is another woman,

381
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,974
and I'm going to find her.

382
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,774
(SIGHS)

383
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,614
Oh, come
and sit down, Doctor.

384
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,991
You must be patient.

385
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,786
Do you expect
perfection at once?

386
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,748
This creature of yours
should be kept under guard!

387
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,626
Mark my words,
he will prove dangerous!

388
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,337
Dangerous?

389
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,839
Poor old Waldman.

390
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,846
Have you never wanted to do
anything that was dangerous?

391
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,809
Where should we be if nobody
tried to find out what lies beyond?

392
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,313
Have you never wanted to look
beyond the clouds and the stars,

393
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,149
or to know what causes
the trees to bud,

394
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:58,319
and what changes
a darkness into light?

395
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,659
But if you talk like that,
people call you crazy.

396
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,665
Well, if I could discover
just one of these things,

397
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,543
what eternity is, for example,

398
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:18,047
I wouldn't care if they
did think I was crazy!

399
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:22,135
You're young, my friend. Your
success has intoxicated you.

400
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,138
Wake up and
look facts in the face.

401
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,850
Here we have a fiend
whose brain...

402
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,310
Whose brain must be
given time to develop.

403
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,522
It's a perfectly
good brain, Doctor.

404
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:38,484
Well, you ought to know. It
came from your own laboratory.

405
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,698
The brain that was stolen from my
laboratory was a criminal brain.

406
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,711
Oh, well. After all, it's
only a piece of dead tissue.

407
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,088
Only evil can come of it.

408
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,592
Your health will be ruined if
you persist in this madness.

409
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,011
I'm astonishingly
sane, Doctor.

410
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,890
You have created a monster,
and it will destroy you!

411
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,850
Patience, patience.

412
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,562
I believe in this monster,
as you call it,

413
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,690
and if you don't, well,
you must leave me alone.

414
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,401
But think of Elizabeth,
your father.

415
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,612
Elizabeth believes in me.

416
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,781
My father never
believes in anyone.

417
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,286
I've got to
experiment further.

418
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,247
He's only a few days old,
remember.

419
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,292
So far he's been kept
in complete darkness.

420
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,545

into the light.
