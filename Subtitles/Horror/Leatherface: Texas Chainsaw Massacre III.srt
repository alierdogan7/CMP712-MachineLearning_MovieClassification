1
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,203
Aah!

2
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:28,569
SubFix by divx.NeKryXe.com

3
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,802
...which was at first thought
to be the site

4
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,610
of an old cemetery, but proved
to be a dry pond bed

5
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:37,349
containing the remains
of s e v eral dead bodies.

6
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,512
A special forensic team under
the dire ction of the county coroner

7
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:42,556
has been helicoptered
to the site

8
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:44,481
to dig out the mass grave

9
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,977
and to try to determine
the victims' cause of death.

10
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:48,610
We'll bring you
more details...

11
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,357
Stop hiding
underneath those things.

12
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:53,650
Ryan.

13
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,779
What?

14
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,721
Radio reception's shit.

15
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:05,460
So's our conversation.

16
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,338
You should be washed
in the blood...

17
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,585
If we beat this thing to death,
we're just going to get mad, right?

18
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,337
I don't want to fight
anymore, okay?

19
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:15,095
Me neither.
What's the point?

20
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,674
Once we get to Florida,
you're off to New York,

21
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,184
then it's Air Britannia
all the way, right?

22
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,055
We're over if we fight,
we're over if we don't fight.

23
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,523
I just need some time
on my own, okay?

24
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,978
I wanted you on this trip
so we could enjoy each other,

25
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,278
we could talk.

26
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,066
You mean talk or tiptoe around
the real issue with chit-chat?

27
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:36,878
Now you sound exactly like
my father. Great.

28
00:04:36,913 --> 00:04:39,514
Hey, turn it up.
We're getting something.

29
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:42,115
...checkpoint at the site
of the mass grave

30
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,909
has caused the
first-ever traffic jam

31
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:45,657
in the history of the interstate.

32
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,336
So if you're
a curious motorist,

33
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,213
be ready to prov e
you're not a killer,

34
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,918
or you may have to spend the night
with a bunch of dead people.

35
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:55,229
Stay tuned...

36
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:57,471
Could be worse.

37
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:01,844
At least we're not as bad off
as those people in that body pit.

38
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,654
- They were murdered.
- Mmm.

39
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,395
My God, they had
to have been.

40
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,267
They didn't jump in with big
grins and bathing suits.

41
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,104
They ought to fry that sucker
if the find him.

42
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,373
Violence is no answer
to violence.

43
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:16,573
Welcome to the real world,
Michelle.

44
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,986
One of these days,
you're gonna have to live in it,

45
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:21,196
no matter where you run.

46
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,649
Welcome to
the red light district.

47
00:05:57,684 --> 00:05:59,616
Are there people
in those bags?

48
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,279
Jeez, looks like we've died
and gone to hell.

49
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,122
...as soon as we
get the details...

50
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,117
Let's not stick around
to meet any of them.

51
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,957
Scotty, get your ass down here.
Make sure you're zipped up tight...

52
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:16,335
The coroner says
they're all toxic.

53
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,801
Roger, I'm coming down.

54
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,797
Wouldn't want to miss
all the poison pigshit.

55
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,860
Oh, shit.

56
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,689
We got more
over here, Scotty.

57
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:40,282
Well, fuck me running.

58
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,569
Flash it before
you dig it out, okay?

59
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:44,363
Yeah, right.

60
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,459
Be careful of that crap.

61
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:59,176
Blood poisoning.

62
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,381
Yeah. Gas gangrene,
the coroner said,

63
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,676
just from touching
this shit.

64
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,972
Oh God.

65
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,560
Oh man, I think
I'm going to barf.

66
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:18,063
Not in front
of those news assholes.

67
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,531
Far side of those trees.

68
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:24,027
Should've listened to my old man
and went into real estate.

69
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,325
Looks like a pretty advanced
stage of decomposition.

70
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,746
It's like those body pits
we found up near Dong Tre.

71
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,340
Just counting skulls,

72
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,253
I'd say we got
40 or 50 bodies here.

73
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:43,397
Jesus.

74
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:45,472
Oh, man.

75
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,593
This is fucked.

76
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,482
60 or 70 bodies, yes.

77
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,026
It seems that when corpses
lay around like this

78
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,939
for long periods of time
under conditions like these,

79
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:04,985
they putrefy into
a substance called adip...

80
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,551
Excuse me, ladies
and gentlemen,

81
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,490
we seem to be
experiencing...

82
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:12,791
Adipocere, you idiot.

83
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,787
You would know that,
Mr. Pre-med.

84
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:18,714
Creamy breakdown
of body fat.

85
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,771
Basically, if you're
buried right,

86
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:22,794
your skin turns
into poison Crisco.

87
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,097
I want to get
out of here.

88
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,093
Uh-huh.
We'll get out of here soon.

89
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:32,930
Here comes ol' deputy dawg.

90
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,859
Coming from?

91
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,417
- L.A.
- Going to?

92
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:43,906
Deland, Florida.

93
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,200
Something wrong
with the airlines?

94
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,321
No, I'm delivering this car
to my father.

95
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:51,288
Do you want to see
the papers?

96
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,576
No, that's okay, ma'am.
Just hurry along.

97
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:56,411
What happened here anyway?

98
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,379
None of your
business, son.

99
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,271
Just move along
and keep moving.

100
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:05,128
Don't stop for nothing
or nobody.

101
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,299
Okay.

102
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,555
- Didn't want to be on TV anyway.
- Ryan, please.

103
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,720
Now what's
bothering you, Michelle?

104
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,851
I just want to get
this trip over with.

105
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:21,520
If I drive all night,
I can.

106
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,199
Do you think whoever
did that is still around?

107
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:36,333
Nah, whoever did that
is long gone.

108
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,288
Sounded like the bodies
were pretty de composed, too.

109
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:41,582
- You see, what happens is...
- Ryan, please.

110
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:43,375
Spare me the postmortems.

111
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,545
Looks like we're about here.

112
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,176
- Where?
- The middle of nowhere.

113
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,387
Aah!

114
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,990
Oh my God.

115
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:19,244
We can't just
leave him here.

116
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,138
I'll take care of it.

117
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:23,128
- No, no.
- Michelle.

118
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:25,083
No, it's my fault.

119
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,961
I'll do it.

120
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,305
I'm sorry, little guy.

121
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,953
Ryan...

122
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,948
I can't do it.

123
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:58,909
Give it to me.

124
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,376
- Thanks for the ride, mister.
- Sure.

125
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:31,608
- You drive real careful now.
- You bet.

126
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,043
You ladies are always my favorite.

127
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:51,420
You know that, huh?

128
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,431
¿Que pasa?

129
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,244
Looks like we got
some customers, ladies.

130
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,246
You stay right here.

131
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,347
You first.

132
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,551
See if the bathroom's safe
for human use.

133
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,553
Dream on.

134
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,307
- You okay?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,896
Hi.

136
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,960
I got ya.
I got ya good.

137
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,921
Five bucks. It's only five bucks.
It's a good picture.

138
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:18,566
What do you say?
3.69 just for you. Give ya... 3.69.

139
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:21,176
No, we're in a hurry.
Could you just fill it up, please?

140
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,846
You're in
a big hurry, huh?

141
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,684
I'm gonna service you
real good, ma'am.

142
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:30,602
Don't you
worry about it.

143
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:40,237
Little California
Daddy's girl, huh?

144
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,117
Bitch says fill it up. I'll fill it
up for you, mascara face.

145
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,959
Make you moan.

146
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,418
Make you moan
real good.

147
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,915
You're gonna like it.
Mm-hmm.

148
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,459
You like me, don't you?

149
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,943
What's the matter,
shortcakes?

150
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:01,133
Don't you
get uppity on me.

151
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,308
It's all right, ma'am.

152
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,804
You ain't giving the lady
a hard time now, are you?

153
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,182
I ain't bothering
nobody, mister.

154
00:14:08,217 --> 00:14:10,440
Uh-huh.

155
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,437
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

156
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,114
He's a little touched.

157
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,444
Been that way ever since he lost his
job over at the old slaughterhouse.

158
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,114
Sort of the town loony,
you might say.

159
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,452
Well, looks like you had
yourself a little mishap here.

160
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:31,371
We hit a little animal
on the road.

161
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:33,787
Oh? Who's we?

162
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:36,133
A friend and I.

163
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:39,303
We, uh...
I killed it.

164
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:43,175
Well, I wouldn't
worry about that.

165
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,973
There's road kill
all over Texas.

166
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:51,975
Natural order of things.

167
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,444
Besides...

168
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,565
If you were the last thing
I saw before I died,

169
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,651
I'd die a happy man.

170
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,326
Don't you ever
do that to me, bitch.

171
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,228
- Who's this?
- Hi.

172
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,231
You can call me Tex.

173
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:40,691
Yippee-yi-ay.

174
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,952
Listen, I'd be glad
to buy you both a beer...

175
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:48,407
whatever you need... if I can catch
a ride as far as Ronesdale.

176
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:51,660
Sorry, Tex. We're on
a pretty tight schedule today.

177
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,060
That right?
You in a big hurry?

178
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:58,834
Well, we could
discuss it, I guess.

179
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:00,043
Okay.

180
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,798
I got to go to the bathroom.
Is it over there?

181
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,758
Yeah, change your life.

182
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,268
Real nice car
you have here.

183
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,771
Thanks.

184
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,082
You know, if you are
headed to Houston,

185
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:02,397
that road over there
is the quickest way.

186
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:04,448
It's a straight shot
on the highway.

187
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:08,153
Well, it used to be,
but this new road here

188
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:10,155
is a hell of a lot
quicker.

189
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,237
You got a map?

190
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:14,029
Yeah, I got a map.

191
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:15,786
I'll show you.

192
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,623
Okay.

193
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,176
Jesus.

194
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,905
See?

195
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,533
Yeah, I see.

196
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:56,406
See?

197
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,210
"1973."

198
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,081
That road over there
ought to be right there.

199
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:02,840
Ain't even on this map.

200
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,107
What's the damn difference?
The distance looks the same.

201
00:18:06,142 --> 00:18:09,304
The difference is it ain't
a good idea to be messing around

202
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,718
these back roads at night when
you don't know where you're going.

203
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,265
Look, man...

204
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,019
I'm just trying to get home.

205
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,396
Yeah, I understand
you're trying to get home,

206
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:26,732
but listen to me...
we can't help you, okay?

207
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,567
I'm sorry.

208
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,785
Where'd that
little weasel get to?

209
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,427
God damn!

210
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,423
What the fuck do you think
you're doing? Get your hands off!

211
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,175
I'm telling you,
I didn't know!

212
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,179
Get the fuck
out of here!

213
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:00,397
Let's go, you shit heap!

214
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:03,101
Skinny son of a bitch!
I was only looking at her!

215
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:05,100
She liked it fine!
Just ask her!

216
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:07,064
Why don't you just
shut up, stupid?

217
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,525
You shut up, motherfucker.
This is my place!

218
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,819
I'll do whatever I want
here in my place!

219
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:14,536
What's wrong?

220
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,615
He's having himself
a peek-a-boo party

221
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,081
with you as the star.

222
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,618
I think I'm
going to puke.

223
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,581
Folks, I think you
better get in your car.

224
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:26,625
- What's wrong?
- Go! Go!

225
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,425
He's got a gun.

226
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,170
Get the hell
out of here!

227
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:31,856
God's gift, huh?

228
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:33,472
Start the car!

229
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,801
...god damn it.
You're too good for me, huh?

230
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:36,767
You're too good for me?!

231
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:39,311
Get the hell out of here!
I'll take care of him.

232
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,307
- I'll take you down right here.
- Go, go, go! Come on!

233
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:45,394
You heifer-butt,
I'm gonna fuck you in hell!

234
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,362
You wanna fuck me, baby,
I know you do!

235
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:51,108
First time you saw me you liked me.
Kind of guy I am!

236
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:54,611
Jesus Christ!

237
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,701
- Holy fuck, he dusted him!
- What happened? Dusted who?

238
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:02,828
- The cowboy! He shot the cowboy!
- What?!

239
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:04,419
Go! Drive faster! Go!

240
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,548
We got to find the cops.
That town.

241
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,585
What if there isn't any town?
Just drive.

242
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,176
- Drive, drive!
- Where?

243
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,595
Where?
Take the cowboy's route.

244
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,841
- What are you talking about?
- Turn right!

245
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:17,718
Go, go, go!

246
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,310
It's Armageddon, bitchface!

247
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:05,974
It's Armageddon, you bitch!
Goddamn it.

248
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:09,144
Trap is sprung now, honey.

249
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,785
Thought there was
a town around here.

250
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,948
That's what he told me.
Would you just slow down?

251
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:22,991
I'm not stopping
until we find somebody.

252
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:25,918
We're going to find somebody.

253
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,622
We're far away from that guy.
He's not going to get us.

254
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:30,707
Would you turn it off?!

255
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:38,472
Shit!

256
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,551
- Calm down! It's a tire tread!
- Stop yelling at me!

257
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:44,596
- If you would just listen to me...
- Shh! Listen.

258
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:47,474
Hear that?

259
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,643
Yeah.

260
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,732
- Where's it coming from?
- I don't know.

261
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,908
- Oh my God.
- It's coming from behind us.

262
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,705
Fuck!

263
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,167
He's gaining on us!

264
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,544
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

265
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,855
Oh my God!
What do they want from us?

266
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:42,529
Oh my God!

267
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:00,839
- We hit another one.
- No, it hit us.

268
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:02,306
He threw it at us.

269
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:05,093
Where the fuck are they?

270
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:07,895
We blew a tire.

271
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,766
Why are they
doing this to us?

272
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:13,567
- Ryan.
- This is not happening.

273
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:16,111
It's happening!
It's happening to us.

274
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:19,316
We got to change this tire
and get out of here now.

275
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:21,492
Okay.

276
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,076
Slow and easy...

277
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,781
'cause I'm about
to fuckin' lose my mind!

278
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,245
Get out the jack,
please.

279
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,793
I'll take care of him.

280
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,022
Come on.

281
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,560
Get the light.

282
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,486
That goes this way.

283
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,544
Let me help you.
We got to move it.

284
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,567
I got to put in
a couple lug nuts.

285
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,989
Did you hear that?

286
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,703
Hurry up. I think that truck
is coming back.

287
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,878
Doesn't sound like
a truck to me.

288
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:24,631
No, it doesn't.

289
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:31,138
Michelle, I could use a little
light down here, please.

290
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:38,187
Finish it, Ryan.
Finish it now.

291
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,198
- Michelle.
- I'm serious.

292
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,618
- Hurry up, Ryan.
- Almost there.

293
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:58,290
Michelle...

294
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,091
I need the light.

295
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:03,670
- I mean it.
- Almost there.

296
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,761
It's done?

297
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,307
It's going to have to do.
Let's hit it.

298
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,773
Run, Ryan!

299
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:27,486
- Get in!
- It's locked! It's locked!

300
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,614
Get in the car!

301
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:34,493
Go, go!

302
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,424
Go, go, go!

303
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,253
It won't go into gear!

304
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:50,217
Aah! Go!
Get out of here!

305
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:58,350
We hit him!
We hit him!

306
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,732
He's coming up
the back! Go!

307
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:15,249
Yes!

308
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,994
What happened?
Did we lose him?

309
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,624
He cut our trunk.

310
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:24,626
Jesus.

311
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,202
We have to pull over
so I can fix the lug nuts.

312
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,824
- I'm not stopping.
- I got to finish tightening them.

313
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:57,207
We're going to lose a tire.

314
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,827
You have to pull over
so I can fix it.

315
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:00,287
I'm not stopping.

316
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:09,344
Listen to me, I am not
taking any more chances.

317
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,549
Now you pull this car ov er
so I can fix the goddamn tire!

318
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,636
All right.

319
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,270
Jesus!

320
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,618
Damn it.

321
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,791
Totaled.

322
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,732
Oh, Je...

323
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:34,131
Jesus.

324
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,068
- Aah!
- Take it easy! Take it easy.

325
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:57,738
You're going to be okay.
Take it easy.

326
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,204
We got
to get her out.

327
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,998
Please help me
get her out.

328
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,202
I'll get her out.
You just get away from the car.

329
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:04,912
Get away from the car.

330
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:38,654
We got to keep moving.
We can't stick around here.

331
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:41,205
Pal...

332
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,408
You can't even
stand around right now.

333
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:45,918
You just take care.

334
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,996
There's some people
after us...

335
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:50,714
A guy with a chainsaw.

336
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:53,794
- You saw what?
- A chainsaw.

337
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:58,423
Listen, I don't want you
to move right now.

338
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:01,134
Sounds like you're
just a few quarts...

339
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,595
shy of a full tank,
you know what I mean?

340
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,853
Hold still.
Hold still.

341
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,057
There's a bunch of guys.
And they have guns, too.

342
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,725
Yeah, I know,
and chainsaws.

343
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,494
Militant lumberjacks...

344
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:12,194
I see them
all the time.

345
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,314
Here, I want you
to take one of these.

346
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,162
I can't believe it.

347
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:26,076
I been going up in the hills
every weekend for two years.

348
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:29,211
I never even seen
another car on that road.

349
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:32,214
I got a survival camp
with a few buddies of mine.

350
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:36,170
Trying to keep in training for
the big blowup, know what I mean?

351
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:38,380
Do you hear what
I'm saying, man?

352
00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:40,090
We're being hunted!

353
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,183
Hunted?

354
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:46,805
Yeah, right.
I hear you, man.

355
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,149
Ryan.

356
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,227
Okay, take it easy.
Take it easy.

357
00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:53,819
You're all right.

358
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:56,148
Most of this stuff looks
superficial. Just sit up.

359
00:30:56,183 --> 00:30:57,781
There we go. Okay.

360
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,277
Here, I want you
to take one of these.

361
00:31:00,312 --> 00:31:01,743
Okay?

362
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,698
A little water.

363
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:08,368
Tex... he's still up there.

364
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:09,793
Who?

365
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,795
Who are you?

366
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,465
- My name's Benny.
- Ow.

367
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,127
I'm the sorry-ass bastard
you almost hit.

368
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:19,505
We got to move.
They might find us.

369
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:25,010
- You people are serious.
- Mister, do you see this?

370
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,784
How many?

371
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,996
We don't know.
Two, maybe more.

372
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:49,243
One's on foot,
and he's got... that.

373
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,714
That's an awfully big saw.

374
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:58,801
Tex... did you see him
up there?

375
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:02,214
No, I couldn't see nothing
except your headlights.

376
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:05,592
He could still be up there.
We got to go check on him.

377
00:32:05,627 --> 00:32:08,685
Wait a minute.
What did you give us?!

378
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,348
Painkillers.
Might make you a little sleepy.

379
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:13,607
What?
Are you nuts?

380
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:16,686
- We have got to move.
- Now, just hold it. Hold it.

381
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:19,561
I can handle this. I'm prepared
for this kind of thing.

382
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:22,401
Now you guys just relax,
and I'll go find your friend.

383
00:32:22,436 --> 00:32:24,027
No, man.
They're out there.

384
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,786
Look, pal,

385
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,407
it doesn't make it any
different from anywhere else.

386
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:30,909
Now, I'll go get some
goodies out of the jeep

387
00:32:30,944 --> 00:32:33,453
and find your buddy.

388
00:32:33,488 --> 00:32:36,672
Stay put, okay?

389
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:39,633
- Wait.
- Wait a minute.

390
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:42,713
Just sit down
before you fall down.

391
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:13,848
Looks like you had
a little mishap.

392
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:16,399
Hey, mister,
I'm glad you came along.

393
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:18,916
My jeep and this car,
we had a...

394
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:20,518
You had an accident.

395
00:33:20,553 --> 00:33:22,085
Already know that.

396
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:32,387
Michelle.

397
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,724
Michelle, come on,
we got to get out of here.

398
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,566
No.

399
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,353
We got to...

400
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:46,658
So pretty.

401
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,071
So beautiful, the glow.

402
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,325
Technology's your friend,
you know?

403
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,793
Yeah, right.
Listen, mister,

404
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:58,914
I got some people hurt down here,
and I need your help.

405
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:01,548
We got the means.
We got the machines.

406
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:06,255
Look, buddy, I need you
to help me turn my jeep up.

407
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,858
You mean upright?

408
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:11,391
Yeah, right side up.

409
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:15,764
Well, what do you think all thes e
fucking flares are for, stupid?

410
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,643
Yeah.
Thanks a lot, buddy.

411
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:37,619
Just a second.
I got to get something.

412
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,124
Well, rocket, brother.

413
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:50,841
Ho, now.

414
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,570
You ready to roll,
young woman?

415
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,201
Just 15 seconds.

416
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,377
Almost home, Lucille.

417
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,729
Push comes to shove.

418
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,072
Damn!

419
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,425
Jesus!

420
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:19,656
Hey, scumbag! Here!

421
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:23,285
You want me, not him!

422
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:45,474
Ohh.

423
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:59,071
- Michelle.
- Hmm?

424
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,662
I can hear him.

425
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:02,636
We got to get out
of here.

426
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:04,576
How long
have we been out?

427
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:06,710
I don't know.

428
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:09,539
We have to metabolize
this shit out of our system,

429
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:12,334
or we're going to be down
for the rest of the night.

430
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:15,229
We got to find the road...

431
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:18,055
or a house or something.

432
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,968
Anyplace is better than here.
We're sitting ducks out here.

433
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,186
Where's the goddamn sunrise?

434
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:26,723
This is going to have
to do for now. Come on.

435
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,773
I can't hear him anymore.

436
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:07,931
Who the hell are you?

437
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,914
What the hell's
going on?

438
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:34,416
What's going on?!

439
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,381
Hey, girl, I need
some questions answered,

440
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,091
and I need them
answered right now.

441
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:45,010
Do you understand me?!

442
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:47,092
Hey.

443
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:49,139
Oh god.

444
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:54,895
I'm sorry.

445
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,774
I didn't know you
were hurt that bad.

446
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,216
The party's
still cooking.

447
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,197
They're still out there.

448
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,701
You some kind
of soldier or what?

449
00:40:09,736 --> 00:40:12,538
Just on the weekends.

450
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,272
Wrong weapon, wrong war.

451
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:20,615
They got us a week ago.

452
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,923
I'm the only one left.

453
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,633
Me and my sister.

454
00:40:24,668 --> 00:40:26,225
Sisters.

455
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,102
We go together.

456
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:32,391
Week, maybe five days ago.

457
00:40:32,426 --> 00:40:33,607
A week?

458
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:35,644
What the hell are you
still doing here?

459
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,688
Keep your voice down!

460
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,359
They watch the road.

461
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,821
They hunt people.

462
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:48,872
They really hunt them.

463
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,583
They trap them
and they kill them.

464
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:54,788
I haven't been able
to get out of the woods.

465
00:40:54,823 --> 00:40:58,205
We just stopped
to help this guy.

466
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,587
We thought
he'd been run over.

467
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:07,092
Day before yesterday,
I had to eat a fucking rat raw...

468
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,811
and some berries
that tasted...

469
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:13,056
tasted like they'd been
thrown up once already.

470
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,684
It's just...
I mean... it...

471
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:32,159
Thanks for what you did.

472
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,745
Thanks.

473
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:39,173
Where is the road?

474
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,002
I don't know.
I heard some noises.

475
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:44,553
Maybe it's
that guy Benny.

476
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,652
Nah, he took off
a long time ago.

477
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:48,717
Who knows how long
we were out.

478
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:50,469
- Benny!
- Shh!

479
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:05,484
Thanks.

480
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:23,418
Benny!

481
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,224
- I got to go.
- They'll be dead soon.

482
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:34,221
Maybe I can bring
the bad guys out in the light.

483
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,641
You coming?

484
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:43,237
All right, you stay here.

485
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:45,858
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

486
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:49,403
Hold up.

487
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:54,825
Keep it.

488
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:57,661
Thanks.

489
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:42,206
Eee!

490
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,753
Nice neighborhood.

491
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:47,813
Damn.

492
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:46,538
- Come on.
- Aah! Aah!

493
00:45:46,573 --> 00:45:48,290
Oh my God.

494
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:52,002
Ryan.

495
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:55,137
Ryan!

496
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:57,508
Go! Get the fuck out of here!

497
00:45:57,543 --> 00:45:59,468
Go! Get out of here!

498
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,471
Get out of here!

499
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,267
Fuck!

500
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,689
No! God!

501
00:46:12,724 --> 00:46:16,318
Please, no!

502
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,030
Ohh!

503
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:59,278
Hello?

504
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:01,738
Hello?

505
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,618
Hello?!

506
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:31,101
Wait, wait.

507
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:54,423
Hey.

508
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,377
It's all right.
It's all right.

509
00:47:57,412 --> 00:47:58,837
I'm not going
to hurt you.

510
00:47:58,872 --> 00:48:00,839
What's your name?

511
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:04,968
This is Sally.

512
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:10,307
Owww!

513
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:14,019
Yakkety-yak,
don't talk back.

514
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:22,785
Girls, sorry to butt in,

515
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,656
but looks like you had yours elf
another little mishap.

516
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:31,411
You know, you're late.

517
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:33,872
Hmm?

518
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,417
Boy, the y just get
dumber and dumber.

519
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,670
Don't they?

520
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:44,800
Don't they?

521
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:53,016
No!

522
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:13,516
I ain't no runt
of the litter,

523
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,879
and I'll prove it
to you one day.

524
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:18,924
What, you think I'm some sort
of a piece of shit?

525
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:21,732
There's gonna come a time
when you're going to find out

526
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:24,506
just what kind of human being I am.
I'm a human being.

527
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:28,635
Bone patrol
for stupid fuckface, eh?

528
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,722
I'll show you
motherfuckers.

529
00:49:31,757 --> 00:49:34,057
That's the way it is.

530
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,810
Aah!

531
00:49:36,845 --> 00:49:38,527
So...

532
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:41,190
how you like Texas?

533
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:50,240
More little nails
if you don't stay put.

534
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:53,876
Why are you doing this?

535
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:56,955
Be cause if you don't poke 'em,
then they don't leak.

536
00:49:57,956 --> 00:49:59,958
And if they don't leak,

537
00:49:59,993 --> 00:50:01,960
we can't feed Grandpa.

538
00:50:01,995 --> 00:50:03,462
Silly.

539
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:14,897
Ruckus, ruckus.
My nap is just a goner.

540
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:19,102
I certainly hope you children
are pleased with yourselves.

541
00:50:19,137 --> 00:50:21,820
Where's Junior?

542
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:25,025
He's mopping up, Mama.

543
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:31,406
That's what you
always say.

544
00:50:31,441 --> 00:50:34,082
Mopping up,

545
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:37,120
which means you ain't
caught 'em all yet,

546
00:50:37,155 --> 00:50:39,665
just like last time.

547
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,381
Please.

548
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,960
What have we done?

549
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:46,505
Can't you stop this?

550
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:54,596
You best shut on up,
or I'll do your tongue first.

551
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:57,105
That's right.

552
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,268
Best not to get
Mama's dander up.

553
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:08,068
Brought home
the bacon, Mama.

554
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:11,572
Come on, Tex.
Give me a hand here.

555
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:14,575
Pull him around.

556
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,619
Get that trap off.

557
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:23,876
Fancy sneakers.

558
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:27,713
All right now...

559
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:34,928
Okay, don't bruise him.

560
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,518
Pretty good size one,
ain't he?

561
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:43,187
Yeah, he's a keeper.

562
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:59,682
We got some dark meat
coming in, too, Mama.

563
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:02,289
Junior'll be trotting it
in any minute.

564
00:52:02,324 --> 00:52:04,333
If he minds.

565
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:17,054
Junior's been getting
out of hand lately,

566
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:20,189
but I got
a present for him.

567
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:24,561
I got a fine present, going
to keep him in line, yes, sir.

568
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:26,814
He liked that last
present you got him...

569
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:30,067
that electronic
thingumajig.

570
00:52:30,102 --> 00:52:31,752
Of course he did.

571
00:52:31,787 --> 00:52:33,909
That's progress, boy.

572
00:52:33,944 --> 00:52:35,996
Technology is our friend.

573
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:38,325
He might even
learn something.

574
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,077
Ain't that right,
Mama?

575
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,707
What do you think
of our little lady?

576
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:50,838
Uncertain.

577
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,799
She looks to me like
she might go

578
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:55,425
all screamy on us, Eddie.

579
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,557
I wish you'd
call me Tex.

580
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:03,559
I told you.

581
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,771
Oh, I'm sorry, boy.
God damn it, I'm sorry.

582
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:16,113
Say, how'd you like
to do us the honor

583
00:53:16,148 --> 00:53:17,739
of plugging
that whore up?

584
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:23,745
Yes, sir.

585
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:33,428
Hey, Tink,

586
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:35,048
this one's still kicking.

587
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:39,970
Yippee-yi-ay.

588
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,098
Hey, if you need anything...

589
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,646
just twitch.

590
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:20,552
Well, I'm going to go
get Junior's present.

591
00:54:20,587 --> 00:54:22,888
Say, Tex, you want
to give me a hand?

592
00:54:22,923 --> 00:54:24,389
That thing's
so damn heavy.

593
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,851
Don't even think of leaving.

594
00:54:27,886 --> 00:54:29,520
Not before dinner.

595
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:41,657
Thank you.

596
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:05,556
? Clean that trap out, Fred?

597
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:07,523
? Clean it good?

598
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:10,567
? So you motherfuckers?

599
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:14,279
? Don't tell me
what I should do.?

600
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:17,533
Take your little
motherfucking face, Tex,

601
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:21,405
and ram it up your butt
is what I'm going to do.

602
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:30,101
It's an eye for an eye,
it's a tooth for a tooth,

603
00:55:30,136 --> 00:55:33,167
it's a hand for a hand,
and an arm for an arm.

604
00:55:33,202 --> 00:55:36,044
What you got in here,
Santa Claus?

605
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,012
I see something.

606
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:41,390
You betcha.
I see something.

607
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:44,803
Somebody's little puppy dog,
aren't you, motherfucker?

608
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:49,731
Sweet.

609
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:52,206
You just tell him
what to do he does it.

610
00:55:52,241 --> 00:55:54,611
Little Alfredo does this,
he does that.

611
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:57,149
'Cause Alfredo's
a stupid motherfucker, huh?

612
00:55:57,184 --> 00:55:59,735
Yeah, well
fuck you!

613
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:03,447
He cleans,
and he does housework.

614
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:09,001
Here we got
a little pretty one, yeah.

615
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:12,289
I liked you a long time ago,
you know that.

616
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,174
Hey, pretty one.

617
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:17,503
We had some good times,
didn't we?

618
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:24,635
We don't have
good times no more.

619
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:28,847
You remind me of my last girl,

620
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:30,481
down in Tupelo.

621
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:32,559
You're gonna go down below.

622
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:37,940
Is it soupy et?

623
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,300
Hey, Junior.

624
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,212
Got something special
for you.

625
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:49,852
Tink did it.

626
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:52,347
Chromes every damn thing.

627
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:24,880
You like it, don't you?

628
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:32,596
Well, looks like
you just got a pres ent

629
00:58:32,631 --> 00:58:34,845
for a job
you didn't finish.

630
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,059
You lost the darky,
didn't you?

631
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,436
Well, didn't you?

632
00:58:43,899 --> 00:58:45,504
Oh, fine.

633
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:47,075
Another toy.

634
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,821
Well, you got to learn.

635
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,953
I'll tell you one damn thing,
by God if...

636
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:01,256
Junior.

637
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,252
Junior,
haven't I told you...

638
00:59:03,287 --> 00:59:04,962
Wait, Mama.
Wait.

639
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:15,055
Okay, okay!

640
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:36,827
It's okay, now.

641
00:59:36,862 --> 00:59:38,120
It's okay.

642
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:44,459
Hey, now.
Hey!

643
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:48,005
Now, now,
don't you fret.

644
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,096
What do you think?

645
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:51,508
Do you want to go
for a head shot or what?

646
00:59:51,543 --> 00:59:53,844
Huh?

647
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:56,763
Let me see a smile.

648
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:00,190
- Let's do it.
- All right.

649
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:03,145
Why don't you
go and do your lessons?

650
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,859
And get that thing off
my cutting board.

651
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:23,499
Who's been dinkin'
around in this thing?

652
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,668
Trap's sprung.

653
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:32,216
Somebody's on the loose.
That's for sure.

654
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:37,728
Shh!

655
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:40,641
This makes
a very loud bang

656
01:00:40,676 --> 01:00:43,519
and an awfully
big hole.

657
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,320
Do I know you?

658
01:00:46,355 --> 01:00:48,864
Shut up and move it!

659
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:51,130
Now I am very scared
of guns, mister,

660
01:00:51,165 --> 01:00:53,362
so please do not
point that at my face.

661
01:00:53,397 --> 01:00:55,454
- How many?
- How many what, O.J.?

662
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:59,416
How many bent, sick fucks
like you are there out here?

663
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:03,038
Hey, baby, I only got one thing to
say to you. You know what that is?

664
01:01:03,073 --> 01:01:05,415
I don't like
the tone of your voice.

665
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,377
What the hell's
wrong with you?

666
01:01:08,412 --> 01:01:09,968
What is this?

667
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,714
Booby traps,
camo netting...

668
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:16,343
What are you people
doing out here?

669
01:01:16,378 --> 01:01:18,303
Big surprise.

670
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:21,765
Fuck you, mister!

671
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:39,283
One down.

672
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:46,475
Please choose
an activity.

673
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:48,977
What is it?

674
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,611
F- o-o-d.

675
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:02,032
No, try again.

676
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:07,871
F- o-o-d.

677
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:11,875
No, try again.

678
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:32,813
F- o-o-d.

679
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,698
No, try again.

680
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:40,154
What kind of
sick shit is this?

681
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:43,782
F- o-o-d.

682
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:47,536
No, try again.

683
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:09,516
Always had a problem with this
hit to the head business...

684
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:12,853
till Tink here
genius ed up a new way.

685
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:38,837
No! Please don't!

686
01:04:38,872 --> 01:04:41,215
Not again!

687
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,136
You promised.
The next one was mine!

688
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:48,597
Let me do it!

689
01:04:50,808 --> 01:04:52,643
I don't see why not.

690
01:04:52,678 --> 01:04:54,186
No!

691
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:57,189
All right, darling.
Go ahead.

692
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,484
Hell, she's old enough.

693
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,445
You ready, honey?

694
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:09,993
Hold Sally.

695
01:05:10,028 --> 01:05:11,912
Okay.

696
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:15,541
Remember what I told you.
Take this one here.

697
01:05:15,576 --> 01:05:18,585
You have to count
one, two...

698
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,177
three.

699
01:05:20,212 --> 01:05:21,839
All right.
I will.

700
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:23,514
Grab on.

701
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:26,051
When I tell you.
You ready?

702
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:28,595
One...

703
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:34,893
two...

704
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:46,572
three!

705
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,955
Good shot!
Good shot.

706
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:58,292
Go get it.

707
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,016
Look here, Mama.
Colored drawers.

708
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:19,730
California.

709
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:28,572
Honey, you go get
washed up for supper now.

710
01:06:34,786 --> 01:06:36,871
We get this 'un skinned,
dress ed out,

711
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:38,957
we'll have enough
sowbelly for a while.

712
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:40,716
Yeah, I guess
that's right, huh?

713
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:44,004
All we need now is
a good mess of greens.

714
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:58,727
Appears we get
to wait a spell on you.

715
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:04,358
Maybe we could, uh...

716
01:07:04,393 --> 01:07:06,652
Let Junior play some.

717
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:11,323
He does make the sweetest
damn babies, you know.

718
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:15,994
Junior likes them
private parts.

719
01:07:16,029 --> 01:07:19,665
We knows what to do
with them parts.

720
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,750
You got that right, Mama.

721
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:26,421
Cut my own out
years back.

722
01:07:26,456 --> 01:07:28,423
I did.

723
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:33,227
Took care
of Papa's, too.

724
01:07:33,262 --> 01:07:35,722
It'll be your turn soon,
little gal.

725
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:38,934
Hey, Tex, come help me
skin this 'un.

726
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:41,436
All righty.

727
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:47,401
Junior.

728
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:26,857
Go, Junior!

729
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:43,957
Motherfucker!

730
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,128
Get down!

731
01:08:49,922 --> 01:08:53,884
Mama!

732
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:57,888
Aah!

733
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:01,558
Tink!

734
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,405
Yeah!

735
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:25,165
Get the bitch!

736
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:39,096
She stuck me!
She stuck me!

737
01:09:40,139 --> 01:09:42,356
Bitch!

738
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:44,691
Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey!

739
01:09:44,726 --> 01:09:46,686
H e y, it's me!
It's me!

740
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:48,647
- Let's go!
- Run, run!

741
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:54,987
Go!

742
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:03,036
Shit!
Now what?

743
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:04,837
Great!

744
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:07,499
Go towards the trees.
Towards the trees! Go!

745
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:13,714
Okay, come on.

746
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:16,717
Shit!

747
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:37,578
Okay. All right.

748
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:40,053
You and me then, huh?

749
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:42,493
You sick... fucker!

750
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:49,249
Come on!

751
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:58,759
Fuck the flesh!
Give me steel!

752
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:02,200
Now damn it, boy...

753
01:11:02,235 --> 01:11:04,056
go get the meat!

754
01:11:05,057 --> 01:11:07,274
Get out
the big skillet.

755
01:11:07,309 --> 01:11:10,604
I'll be in hell
for breakfast.

756
01:11:10,639 --> 01:11:14,149
Son of a bi... tch.

757
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:37,631
Woo-eee!

758
01:11:41,134 --> 01:11:42,928
Motherfucker!

759
01:11:45,806 --> 01:11:47,808
Come on, sweetheart.

760
01:11:48,809 --> 01:11:50,275
Let's see
what you got.

761
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,396
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

762
01:11:52,431 --> 01:11:53,946
Why don't you
leave us alone?

763
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:55,941
- We're hungry.
- You ever heard of pizza?!

764
01:11:58,652 --> 01:11:59,945
I like liver.

765
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:04,741
And onions.

766
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:13,208
And pain!

767
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:41,695
- Come on!
- Whack, whack.

768
01:12:44,114 --> 01:12:45,282
Time for dinner!

769
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:48,869
You're toast, fuck!

770
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:14,193
Yeah.

771
01:13:14,228 --> 01:13:16,480
You son of a bitch.

772
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:32,079
Aah!

773
01:13:49,513 --> 01:13:51,682
Fuck! Come on.

774
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:28,760
Aah!

775
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:53,827
Benny!

776
01:14:53,862 --> 01:14:55,996
Get him!

777
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,460
Get him!

778
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:07,424
Get him, Benny!

779
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:13,263
Benny!

780
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:24,525
Yeah!

781
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:32,456
Benny!

782
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:35,160
Here, take it!

783
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,955
Yes!

784
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:41,048
Yes!

785
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,417
Go, Benny!

786
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:48,924
Benny!

787
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:04,189
Aah!

788
01:16:04,224 --> 01:16:05,899
Benny!

789
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:22,416
No!

790
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:35,144
Sorry...

791
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:37,723
little... guy.

792
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:40,371
Sorry...

793
01:16:40,406 --> 01:16:41,977
little...

794
01:16:42,012 --> 01:16:43,353
guy!

795
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:45,439
Sorry...

796
01:16:45,474 --> 01:16:46,482
little...

797
01:16:46,517 --> 01:16:48,233
guy!

798
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:02,606
No.

799
01:18:02,641 --> 01:18:05,192
No, no...

800
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:08,355
Hey, hey, it's me!
It's me. It's Benny.

801
01:18:09,523 --> 01:18:11,150
Let's get out of here.

802
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:12,985
You...

803
01:18:14,111 --> 01:18:15,160
You made it!

804
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:16,787
Of course I made it.

805
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:19,074
Hey, we made it.
We made it!

806
01:18:19,109 --> 01:18:21,326
Come on, let's get
out of here.

807
01:18:21,361 --> 01:18:23,036
Come on.

808
01:18:25,164 --> 01:18:26,999
Okay.

809
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,968
It's knock-knock time
in Lubbock, and I'm back!

810
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:45,767
You steal Daddy's car,
then you steal my car.

811
01:18:45,802 --> 01:18:48,353
I'm gonna get ya, cut ya up.
You cheated on me.

812
01:18:48,388 --> 01:18:49,980
Had to go out
with four-eyes, huh?!

813
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:53,657
Old four-eyes, eh?

814
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:55,319
You're two little
heifer-butts, huh?

815
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:06,497
Where are you?
Huh? Huh? Where are you?!

816
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:10,340
- No!
- Face it...

817
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:12,836
You flirtin' more
and you enjoyin' it less.

818
01:19:12,871 --> 01:19:14,793
That's what they do
in California.

819
01:19:14,828 --> 01:19:16,715
I never been with
a California girl.

820
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,901
I like that skin
of yours.

821
01:19:18,936 --> 01:19:21,053
- Get away!
- Hey, hey!

822
01:19:21,088 --> 01:19:22,805
Hey, you fuck!

823
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,812
I hate when this
happens, you know.

824
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,529
Okay, okay, now.

825
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:35,317
I guess this kills our chance
for dinner on Saturday night?

826
01:19:35,352 --> 01:19:37,236
Shut up.

827
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:40,739
What are the chances
of a brainless bitch like you

828
01:19:40,774 --> 01:19:42,491
knowing how to use
that thing, hmm?

829
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:47,538
Pretty goddamn good,
you backwoods motherfucker!

830
01:20:22,531 --> 01:20:25,284
There's road kill
all over Texas.

831
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:27,619
You got that right.

832
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,685
Ha

833
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:41,026
Headin' for the southland

834
01:21:41,061 --> 01:21:44,161
Down Texas way

835
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:46,990
Ready for the lightnin'

836
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:49,698
With a chainsaw blade

837
01:21:49,733 --> 01:21:52,637
Here's your invitation

838

To keep you face to face

841
01:22:01,164 --> 01:22:04,233
Screamin' in the darkness

842
01:22:04,268 --> 01:22:07,078
As they nail you down

843
01:22:07,113 --> 01:22:10,023
Swingin' the hammer

844
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:12,705
No one hears a sound

845
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:15,735

You're just a prisoner

850
01:22:27,677 --> 01:22:30,909
In his game of chance

851
01:22:30,944 --> 01:22:33,669
Another referee

852
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:36,498
For the devil's dance

853
01:22:36,533 --> 01:22:38,000
Huh!

854
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:53,575
Come across the cosmos

855
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:56,575
Chainsaw running wild

856
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:59,472
Come into the heavens

857
01:23:59,507 --> 01:24:02,172

858
01:24:02,207 --> 01:24:04,802
