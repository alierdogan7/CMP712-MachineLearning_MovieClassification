The Walking Dead...

3
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:10,344
Is my brother alive?

4
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:11,588
Yeah.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,253
- Hold up!
- Let go of her.

6
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,966
Now we're gonna
go for a little drive.

7
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:23,065
From the looks of 'em, they
got to be set up pretty good.

8
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,483
I'll find out where.

9
00:00:33,787 --> 00:00:35,788
( breathing deeply )

10
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,563
Merle: You don't even know
why you're here, do you?

11
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:49,067
I didn't mean you no harm.

12
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:51,370
I lowered my gun,

13
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:54,306
but you raised yours.

14
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,711
You were an asshole out there,

15
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:02,246
just like you were on that
rooftop back there in Atlanta.

16
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:07,018
What y'all did,
leaving me up there--

17
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,921
people wouldn't
do that to an animal.

18
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:11,423
We went back for you.

19
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,957
Ain't you thoughtful?

20
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,059
We did, all of us--

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,194
Rick, Daryl, T-Dog.

22
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:21,932
Mm, T-Dog.

23
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,401
Yeah, big ol'
spear-chucker,

24
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:26,870
the one I was pleading with.

25
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,339
Mm-hmm, the one
that dropped the key.

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,740
Tell me where he's at.

27
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,275
I'm sure T-Dog would like
to bury the hatchet,

28
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:36,813
let bygones be bygones.

29
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:38,815
He didn't make it.

30
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:43,920
Well, I hope he went slow.

31
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,921
Yeah.

32
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,893
How about the rest?

33
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,062
Hmm?

34
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:56,765
How about my baby brother?

35
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,600
You can't tell me he's alive

36
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,369
and then hold off
on where he is.

37
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:04,939
No?

38
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,409
Well, maybe the farmer's
daughter will help me out.

39
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,684

You're the sneaky one,

00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:27,292
said which direction it was in,

168
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,760
that it was a straight shot.

00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:11,733
I'll bake a cake

00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:22,577
- And when he gets here--
- <i>He's gonna do nothing,</i>

185
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:25,747
not if he wants you
and Bo Peep back.

186
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:28,415
Think I'm in this by myself?

187
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,417
You can't take us all.

188
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:32,653
There's too many of us.

189
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:35,956
There ain't a pair
of nuts between

190
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,424
the whole pussy lot of you.

191
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,526
We've been on the road,

192
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,963
not hiding in some dungeon.

193
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:47,299
Rick, Shane, Dale, Jim, Andrea.

194
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:53,806
Really?

195
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:56,609
<i>Is that right?</i>

196
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,598
Thank you.

00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:34,970
Oscar: <i>How do you know
we can trust her?</i>

198
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:37,639
Beth: This is Maggie and Glenn.
Why are we even debating?

199
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,741
Daryl: We ain't.
I'll go after them.

200
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:41,476
Rick: Well, this place
sounds pretty secure.

201
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:44,479
- You can't go alone.
- I'll go.

202
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,113
Me, too.

203
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:49,483
I'm in.

204
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:58,392
I got the flash bangs
and I got the tear gas.

205
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:00,327
You never know
what you're gonna need.

206
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:05,598
Hey.

207
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:09,836
Hey, don't you worry
about your old man.

208
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:11,805
I'm gonna keep my eye on him.

209
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:21,446
- Wasn't this place overrun?
- It was.

210
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:23,916
And you cleared it out
all by yourselves?

211
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,750
Just the few of you?

212
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,319
There were others.

213
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,857
Carl.

214
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,840
- What you did for Mom--
- I had to.

215
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:54,978
<i>Yeah, I-- I know.</i>

216
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:57,513
I know, and I'm sorry.

217
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,451
No one should have
to go through that.

218
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,324
How long will you be gone?

219
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:13,162
Look, if something happens
while we're gone--

220
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:15,030
We'll be all right.

221
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:19,468
If anything happens,
you get everyone

222
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,435
locked in the cells,
keep them all safe.

223
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:23,905
- I will.
- <i>I know.</i>

224
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:25,907
I know you will.

225
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,781
Take care of your sister,
all right?

226
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:39,219
Daryl's been calling her
Ass-Kicker.

227
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,556
Ass-Kicker?

228
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:46,026
<i>Has he, now?</i>

229
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:48,428
I've been thinking, what
should we really call her?

230
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:52,132
What do you think?

231
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:57,803
Remember my third grade
teacher, Mrs. Mueller?

232
00:16:57,804 --> 00:17:00,139
Of course.

233
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,209
Her first name was Judith.

234
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,077
Do you think
that's a good name?

235
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:08,447
I think that's--
that's a fine name.

236
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:12,350
Judith it is.

237
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,627
Stay safe.

238
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:25,062
Nine lives, remember?

239
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:31,168
Bring them back.

258
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,016
Sure.

All righty, I want you

279
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:23,319
fighting my way
off that roof--

280
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,987
one hand,

00:21:25,988 --> 00:21:28,257

282
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:31,326
walkers chomping down at me

I'll ask the questions again,

I need you to end the
subject's reanimated state.

299
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:28,220
All right.

300
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:29,689
I've been trying
to determine whether

301
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,458
trace memory and human
consciousness exist

302
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:35,327
after the subject
has transformed,

303
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:38,664
but I had no baseline
to work off of

304
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:40,632
till now.

305
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:42,300
Prostate cancer.

306
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:44,302
We didn't have the
resources to treat him,

307
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:47,272
so he volunteered
to be the test subject.

308
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:50,742
He's been very cooperative.

309
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:52,444
He's a remarkable man.

310
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,580
You're close?

311
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,682
We spent a lot
of time together.

312
00:23:57,683 --> 00:24:00,718
The song, the singing
bowl, the questions--

313
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:03,621
we've done that
a few dozen times.

314
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:08,125
These are cues that
will hopefully linger

315
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:11,094
in his unconscious mind
even after he's died.

316
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:14,363
There is no unconscious
mind, Milton.

317
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:16,666
When they turn,
they become monsters.

318
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,401
That's all.

319
00:24:18,402 --> 00:24:22,271
Whoever they once were is gone.

320
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,474
We'll see.

00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:31,346
You haven't seen this

322
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:33,348

00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:35,818
No.

346
00:25:53,258 --> 00:25:55,893
The kid and Andrea both say
they went back for me.

347
00:25:55,894 --> 00:25:58,296
So what? He won't break,
say where his people are?

put some hair on his balls.

and we'll drive you there.

363
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,028
I want to talk to Glenn.

364
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,032
I can't allow that.

365
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,768
Your people are dangerous.

366
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,070
Handcuffed my man to a roof,

367
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,406
forced him to amputate
his own hand.

368
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,507
I don't know
anything about that.

369
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:03,180
You just tell us where they are
and we'll bring them here.

370
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:06,883
You'll be safe, I promise.

371
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:13,588
No?

372
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:15,590
Fine.

373
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:20,129
Let's try something else.

374
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,267
Stand up, please.

375
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:36,644
Stand up.

376
00:28:45,753 --> 00:28:48,155
Take off your shirt.

377
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:50,857
No.

378
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:54,794
Take off your shirt

379
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:57,497
or I'll bring
Glenn's hand in here.

380
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:19,117
Go on.

381
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:33,286
So you gonna talk?

382
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:35,989
You can do whatever
you're gonna do.

383
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,925
And go to hell.

384
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:25,536
They have patrols.
We're better off on foot.

385
00:31:25,537 --> 00:31:27,703
How far?
Night's coming.

386
00:31:27,704 --> 00:31:29,872
It's a mile, maybe two.

for my baby, while I was...

390
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:09,009
working things out--

391
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,378
thank you.

392
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:13,346
It's what we do.

393
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:25,692

- Down.

397
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:49,046
There's too many of them.

398
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:55,219
This way.

399
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:03,827
Through there.
Come on.

400
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:08,665
Get the door.

Keep it down.

The smell, it's loud.

404
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:22,311
Oscar:
What the hell is that?

405
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:25,248
It's got to be a fox
or what's left of one.

406
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:30,520
I guess Lassie went home.

- We don't mean any harm.

410
00:34:07,888 --> 00:34:09,589
- Get outta my house!
- Okay, okay, okay.

411
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,391
We will, but we can't
right now.

412
00:34:11,392 --> 00:34:12,958
- Now!
- Shut him up.

413

414

There are walkers outside.

- I'll call the cops!
- I am a cop.

416
00:34:25,137 --> 00:34:29,140
Now I need you
to lower the gun.

417
00:34:30,142 --> 00:34:32,444
Don't do anything rash.

418
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,912
Everything's fine.
Let's just--

419
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:35,947
let's just take this
nice and slow, okay?

420
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,849

00:34:58,636 --> 00:35:00,336
- Help me!
- Don't open that door.

431
00:35:00,337 --> 00:35:02,070

Remember the Alamo?

434
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:25,627
Help me with the door.

He's dead.
Check the back.

Your name is Michael Coleman.

00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,670
You were married
to Betty Coleman.

450
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:56,974

Your children were Michael Jr. and Emily.

451

Did you see that?
He responded.

452

Their fingers move.
That could be anything.

No, he can't raise his hand.
It's the angle.

I want to try again
without the restraints.

455

- No.
- We may have tethered his consciousness.

- <i>We have to try.</i>
<i>- No.</i>
