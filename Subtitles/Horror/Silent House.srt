1
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,498
(waves crashing)

2
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,611
(ominous music)

3
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,480
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, Dad.

4
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,018
- I hit the Internet cafe.

5
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,188
You know how many e-mails
I had in my box?

6
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,697
Eighty-three.

7
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,632
- Oh, you're a popular guy.
- Very.

8
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,069
Of course, 60 of them were ads
trying to get me to buy something.

9
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,800
Sarah, did you leave
these tools on the ground?

10
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,135
- I might have.

11
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,540
- Let's get them in the bag
and bring them in the house, please.

12
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,805
We don't want it to rain on them.

13
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,308
Oh, I checked your Facebook page.

14
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,410
What's-his-name
wrote on your wall again.

15
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,648
- God, I should
never have added you.

16
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,048
Yeah, he, um...

17
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,058
...wants to get back together.

18
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,721
- Of course he does.

19
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,732
I told you.
Princess, he doesn't deserve you.

20
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,501
- There you are.

21
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,010
And there you are.
- Here I am.

22
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,410
- Mm-hmm.

23
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,504
Hey, uh, we have a problem.

24
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,184
- I've barely been gone an hour.
What now?

25
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,411
- You'll see.

26
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,350
- Great. Do I have to?
- Yeah.

27
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,184
Hey, I was looking for you.
Did you go into town?

28
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,783
- Mm-mm.
- I didn't think so.

29
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,351
Where were you?
- Outside.

30
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,260
(John): Working very hard on the garden.

31
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,764
- Oh, we have a garden?

32
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,595
- Ahem. I had a headache.

33
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,532
- Haven't you heard that one before?
(Peter laughing)

34
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,036
- I did!

35
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,368
- I know, honey.

36
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,770
- You all better now?

37
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,535
- Yes. Thank you, Uncle Peter.

38
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,871
(John): So what is this big problem?

39
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,205
- All right, all right. This way.

40
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,909
- Why can't you just tell me about it?

41
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,213
- No, this is something
you have to see.

42
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,117
(rock music playing on stereo)

43
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,494
I'll give you a hint. It's in here.

44
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,389
(John): Funny.

45
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,492
(lowering music)
- What do you think?

46
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,066
- How are you supposed
to tell anything from that?

47
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,731
- What, you need binoculars,
old man?

48
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,673
Just get your face up there.
Look in there.

49
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,235
- Okay. Oh.

50
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,805
That's really... Is this necessary?

51
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,745
I made a hole! What are you...?

52
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,979
(Sarah laughing)

53
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,920
Are you impressed with your dad?
I'm impressed with your dad.

54
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,921
(John): Now that, little brother,
is a hole.

55
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,525
(Peter): Nicely done.

56
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,253
- That is not good.

57
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,024
- No, not good.

58
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,658
(Sarah): What is it?
- Oh, it's mould.

59
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,703
Honey, you know what?
I want you to stand back. This is really bad.

60
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,535
I don't want you breathing it in.
It can make you really sick.

61
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,041
- Just looking at it
is making me sick.

62
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,442
This whole house could be infected,
for all we know.

63
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,603
- Affected, not infected.

64
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,205
- Affected, infected, whatever.

65
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,945
- Well, if you cover it up,
who'll ever know, right?

66
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,179
- That's true.

67
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,948
Just a minute ago,
we had a tiny hole to deal with.

68
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,681
Now we have a big hole.

69
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,782
- Well, the insurance'll cover it.

70
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,124
It's obviously part of the leak.

71
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,323
(sighing)
Did you remember to bring the, um...?

72
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,023
- Boom!
- Ah, great minds think alike.

73
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,801
(Polaroid whirring)

74
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,897
- So... what do you want to do?

75
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,205
- Why are you asking me?
We're outta here in a few days.

76
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,871
- Oh, okay. See here,
this is where it gets tricky.

77
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,479
You're gonna dump
this whole thing on me.

78
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,416
But it comes with the perk
of you not being here.

79
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,977
So dare I complain?

80
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,645
- It's what you do best.

81
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,918
- All right, I'll deal with it.

82
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,391
Just don't give me shit later
when you find out how.

83
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,928
- Well, if you do it right the first time,
I won't have to.

84
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,896
Have you checked the wall
all the way down to the basement?

85
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,989
- I just figured out
that it got down here.

86
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,658
- Okay, come on.

87
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,398
Bring the work light, please.

88
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,331
(laughing)
- Have fun.

89
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,005
(laughing spookily)

90
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,209
(Sarah screaming, laughing)
Uncle Peter, don't do that!

91
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,219
- Come on. You used to love that
when you were a little girl.

92
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,845
(John): Any day now!

93
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,382
- I'm coming!

94
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,722
(Peter growling playfully)

95
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,262
(laughing)

96
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,561
How are you, Sarah?

97
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,135
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

98
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,367
- Yeah. How are you?

99
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,135
- Look at you.

100
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,874
I can't get over
how grown up you are.

101
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,744
(John): You gonna come down here,
or what?

102
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,076
- Bite me! See you later.

103
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,390
(knocking on door)

104
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,396
(knocking continues)

105
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,072
(faint rattling)

106
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,245
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,684
- Wow, I can't believe you're here!

108
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,085
You don't remember me, do you?

109
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,286
- I'm so embarrassed.

110
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,796
- I'm Sophia. We used to play together.

111
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,096
- Oh, of course. Yeah.

112
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,761
How are you?

113
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,104
- I'm quite good, actually,
especially now that I'm finding you here.

114
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,477
Why is it so dark in here?

115
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,104
- The power's out.

116
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,048
My dad thinks rats
chewed through the wires.

117
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,712
I'd invite you in, but there's...

118
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,288
really no place to hang or anything.

119
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,950
- That's okay.
I can't stay long anyways.

120
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,054
It's beautiful, isn't it?

121
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,897
How long's it been
since you were out here?

122
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,731
- A long time, years.

123
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,335
- Yeah. I come by once in a while,
and I've seen other people here,

124
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,839
but never you.

125
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,808
- Yeah, other family
come out now and then,

126
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,403
but no one's really been here
this last summer.

127
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,210
Well, except for the people

128
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,580
who keep breaking in
and messing the place up.

129
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,814
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

130
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,652
Well, they broke almost all our windows.

131
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,818
My uncle had to call the police
to run them off and...

132
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,993
- So what are you doing here now?

133
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,992
- Fixing it up. We're gonna sell it.

134
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,658
- That's too bad.

135
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,831
And aside from selling this house,
what are you up to?

136
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:36,899
- Nothing much.

137
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,943
- Are you in school or something?

138
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,707
- No, me and school
don't really go together.

139
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:46,181
But I'm working for my dad
and thinking about doing something else.

140
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,548
- Yeah, it's tough
getting any kind of job these days.

141
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,854
There's so many things I want to do,

142
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,886
but I never seem
to be able to do any of them.

143
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,027
Can you believe how long it's been?

144
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,203
Remember when we used to play dress-up
and do makeovers?

145
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,071
- Did we?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,973
(laughter)
- Oh, my God.

147
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,036
It's been so long,
I swear, sometimes,

148
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,742
I think I have holes up here.

149
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,251
- I have a pile of photos around somewhere.
I'll have to find them.

150
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,714
- Yeah.

151
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,787
- You always had the best hair.

152
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,464
So how long are you around for?

153
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,559
- We've already been here a couple days,

154
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,400
and my dad thinks
we're gonna head out soon.

155
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,269
- Really?

156
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,898
Well, you maybe wanna hang out later?

157
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,808
- Yeah, that could be good.

158
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,080
(soft laughter)

159
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,742
Oh, the phone lines aren't set up, though,

160
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,078
and our cells don't work up here.

161
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,085
- It's okay, I'll just come by later.

162
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,656
- Okay.

163
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,591
- I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

164
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,095
It's so good to see you.

165
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,929
- Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

166
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,169
- I'll see you later.

167
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,837
- You know, I do remember you.

168
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,611
- How could you forget?

169
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,146
See you later.

170
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,393
(Peter): John, if you care so much
about the way it's done,

171
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,062
you can do it yourself, okay?
Just do it yourself.

172
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,901
Just trying to be helpful.

173
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,736
You're an asshole.

174
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,277
- What? What'd I do now?
- Sorry. I gotta get outta here, Sarah.

175
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,978
- Whoops.

176
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,242
- Can I have the keys to my car, please?

177
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,612
- Uh...

178
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,243
- You know where they are.
Give me the keys.

179
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,755
- When you're done
with your temper tantrums,

180
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,279
see if you can get the electrician
on the phone, please.

181
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,118
- That would be awesome,
if he could come out here.

182
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,456
We could use his needle-nose pliers
to get that stick out of your ass.

183
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,096
(snickering)

184
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,292
- What was that?
- I love you, brother.

185
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,762
(door closing)

186
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,439
- I don't know why my brother
always has to make everything so difficult.

187
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,673
- Yeah, when he doesn't do
what you want him to.

188
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,771
- Exactly. You see,
if everyone would just do what I say,

189
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,317
we wouldn't have any problems,
would we?

190
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,112
- Uh-huh.
(laughter)

191
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,985
Do you need any help down there?
- No, it's okay.

192
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,954
- Okay.

193
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,530
(knocking)

194
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,873
(knocking)

195
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,391
(crickets chirping and birds squawking)

196
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,553
(thudding)

197
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,791
(creaking)

198
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,260
- Hey. What are you doing?

199
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,399
- I just thought I heard something upstairs.

200
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,232
- It's probably the damn rats.

201
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,896
- God, don't remind me.

202
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,566
No, it sounded like someone was up there.

203
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,837
- Maybe it's your uncle.

204
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,403
- No, his car's not here.

205
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,609
(laughing)
- I know how you think, sweetie.

206
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,413
Would you like me to go upstairs
and have a look?

207
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,580
- Yeah.
- Okay.

208
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:36,824
(sighing)

209
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,608
- Wait! I'm gonna come with you.

210
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,006
Jesus!

211
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,478
- I get you?

212
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,642
- Yeah, you did and that hurt.
- I'm sorry.

213
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,644
(Sarah scoffing)

214
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,981
- What, you're trying to be funny?

215
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,318
- A little bit.

216
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,663
(door opening)

217
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,696
(sighing)

218
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,879
- What's that?
- Uh, it's just...

219
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,016
It's just nothing.
It's photographs for the insurance.

220
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,361
I don't know why your uncle
just leaves things laying around like this.

221
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,123
Ridiculous.

222
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,382
Sorry.

223
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,723
Honey, you're gonna really have to start
making some progress in this room.

224
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,428
You haven't even started on this closet.

225
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,093
- Most of it isn't mine.

226
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,096
- So, what, it's just gonna stay here?

227
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,739
What are you doing in here?

228
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,411
I don't know if you got the fact
that we're packing it up to get out?

229
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,113
- Yes, I do understand that.

230
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,089
- That box is completely empty.

231
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,452
(Peter sighing)

232
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,624
If your cousins don't wanna help out,

233
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,259
just keep what you want,
throw everything else out.

234
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,101
- Okay.

235
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,336
- At least that's empty.
- Right, but what about the noise?

236
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:41,538
- Honey, it's an old house.
They make noises.

237
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,444
I'm sure it's nothing.

238
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,443
But I'll keep looking around, okay?

239
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,816
- Thank you.

240
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,278
- I want you to sit down,
go through that stuff,

241
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,881
and start throwing things away.

242
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,324
I wanna come back here
and see full garbage bags.

243
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,483
- All right.
- You hear me?

244
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,790
- Yes.

245
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,798
- All right. I'll be right back.

246
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,491
(door closing)

247
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,013
(rattling)

248
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,388
(ice cubes tinkling)

249
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,356
- Daddy?

250
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,630
(footsteps approaching)

251
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,465
- Yeah?

252
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,562
- What's going on?

253
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,697
- Nothing's going on.

254
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,708
What's going on in there?
Are you packing?

255
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,573
- Yeah, I'm throwing stuff out.

256
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,375
- Good. That's what I wanna hear.

257
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,245
(footsteps receding)

258
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,560
(door creaking shut)

259
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,401
(footsteps approaching)

260
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,171
(loud thud)
(gasping)

261
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,737
- Dad?

262
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,371
Daddy?

263
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,395
Dad?

264
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,077
Daddy?

265
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,652
(exhaling)

266
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,167
(sighing)

267
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:03,298
Daddy?

268
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,544
(gasping)

269
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,941
Come on, Dad.

270
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,187
(screaming)

271
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,780
(panting)

272
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,625
(exclaiming in frustration)

273
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,472
(objects rattling)

274
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,820
(sighing)

275
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,042
(grunting)

276
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,524
(thudding)

277
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,213
(door creaking)

278
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,603
(bottle rolling)

279
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,011
(faint footsteps)

280
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,198
(footsteps growing louder)

281
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,944

286
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,701
(breathing heavily)

287
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,122
(floorboards creaking)

288
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,652

289
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,455

(sobbing)

295
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,600
Oh, my God.
Daddy, what have they done to you?

296
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,413
(weeping)

297
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,719
Daddy.

298
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,123
Daddy, wake up.

299
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,899
Oh, my God.

300
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,440
(sobbing)
Wake up. Wake up!

301
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,908
(John groaning softly)

302
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,646
Oh, my God. You're alive.

303
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,621
You're gonna be okay.

304
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,763
You're gonna be okay.

305
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,666
Oh, my God.

(John groaning)

308
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,822
Okay, the key. Where's the key?

309
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,544
You're gonna be okay.

310
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,489
I'm gonna come back.

311
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,662
Daddy, hang on.
Okay, I'm gonna go get help.

(horn honking)

338
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,149
- Sarah, what are you doing out here?

339
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,316
Why aren't you back at the house?
- Uncle Peter!

340
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,619
(Sarah sobbing)
Hey. Sarah.

341
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,659
It's okay. Hey, what's going on?

342
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,194
Sarah, tell me what's going on.

343
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,456
- They got Daddy!

344
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,931
- Who got...?
You have blood all over you.

345
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,798
What is going on, Sarah?
- They fucking killed him!

346
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,267
- Sarah, who hurt your dad?

347
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,499
Somebody was back at the house? Who?

348
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,666
- There was just a girl.

349
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,266
- A girl? I don't see any girl.

350
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,278
Sarah, you gotta tell me what's going on
so I can help you.

351
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,337
What is going on?
Where is your dad?

352
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:48,111
- He's at...
He's in the room, on the floor.

353
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,676
- Is he back at the house?
- Yeah.

354
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,118
- Okay.

355
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,521
- Hey, where are you going?
- To get your dad.

356
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,182
- Are you fucking kidding me?!

357
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,284
Uncle Peter, we need to go get help!

358
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,319
- If your dad is hurt,
we need to help him right now.

359
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,489
We don't have any time
to go back into town, Sarah.

360
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,622
(Sarah sobbing)
- No! Please!

361
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,498
- Tell me how many people
you saw back at the house.

362
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,501
- I don't know!
- Just give me an idea. One, two, three?

363
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,139
Tell me what I'm dealing with here.
- There was one man--

364
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,802
- Back at the house?
- And then there was just a girl by the road!

365
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,471
- Jesus, goddamn squatters.

366
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:16,877
- Please, stop!

367
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,211
- It's okay, Sarah.
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.

368
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:21,682
- I don't wanna be here!!!

369
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,481
- Sarah, come on, calm down.

370
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,154
God...

371
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,385
Here.

372
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,493
Your wrist is bleeding.

373
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:35,396
We'll tie this up first.
I got something here. C'mere.

374
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,330
(moaning)
I'm sorry.

375
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,857
I'm sorry. I know that hurts.

376
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,902
All right, just put pressure on that.
Hold on to it.

377
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,370
Sarah, honey, it's gonna be okay.
All right?

378
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,671
- Where are you going?

379
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,042
- I'm gonna get your dad.
Just stay in the car.

380
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,013
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting my gun.

381
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,880
- You can't leave me alone here!
- I'm gonna be right back!

382
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,883
Just stay in the car, Sarah!
- No!

383
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,749
(sobbing)
No!

384
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,689
- Stay in the car and lock the doors.
Lock it!

385
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:04,251
All right.

386
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,861
(sobbing)

387
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,891
(clearing throat)

388
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,637
(gasping)

389
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,150
(screaming and sobbing)

390
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,879
(panting)

391
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,789
- Uncle Peter!

392
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,559
Uncle Peter?

393
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,019
(screaming)

394
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,184
- Jesus, Sarah!

395
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,521
What are you doing?
I told you to stay in the car!

396
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:04,089
- You left the trunk open!
- No, I didn't! I closed the trunk!

397
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,328
- Someone got in the car!

398
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,763
- What?

399
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,106
- You can't open it.
I locked him out.

400
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,444
No!

401
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,040
- Do you have my key?
- Yeah, I'm not giving it--

402
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,950
- Give me the key, Sarah!
- I'm not gonna give it to you!

403
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:27,114
(sobbing)
Please don't! I don't want to!

404
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,625
I don't wanna go out there.
- Okay. Okay...

405
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,855
(sobbing)
Okay...

406
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,563
Okay.

407
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,071
I'm sorry.

408
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,144
I'm sorry about before. I didn't know.

409
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,807
You all right? You sure?

410
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,315
(shakily): Yeah.

411
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:01,249
- Can you show me exactly
where you last saw your father?

412
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,059
I looked around,
but I didn't see anybody.

413
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,563
I looked quick, but...
Here, take this.

414
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,832
How's your wrist?
- It's okay.

415
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:16,599
- All right, we're sticking together now.

416
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,732
- What if he gets in the basement?
- Forget about it.

417
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,503
We're gonna get your dad,
we're gonna get outta here.

418
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,339
Get right behind me. C'mon.

419
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,006
C'mon.

420
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,092
John?

421
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,106
John?

422
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,641
John?

423
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,009
- He wasn't in that room.

424
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:40,848
- Where was he?

425
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,591
- He was... in there.

426
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:53,925
- Okay.

427
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,099
Let's look again.

428
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,537
- He was right here.

429
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,408
- Oh, Jesus.

430
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:47,355
Sarah, how was your father
when you last left him?

431
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,052
Could he have gotten up?
Could he have moved somewhere?

432
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,588
- I can't... see how.

433
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,603
- Okay, well, maybe he...

434
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,241
Maybe he came to.

435
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,690
(sniffling)

436
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,279
- Uncle Peter?

437
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,250
- Over here.

438
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:24,252
I don't think there's anybody
on this floor.

439
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,084
Yeah.

440
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,690
(exhaling)

441
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,339
(softly): Oh, man.

442
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,775
- What? What is that?

443
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,506
- Uh, it's...

444
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,173
It's garbage. Here.

445
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,145
Gotta get this outta here.

446
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,160
- Did you check upstairs?

447
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,496
- Quickly. Let's...

448
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:16,962
Let's look again.

449
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,004
(Sarah sniffling)

450
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,692
(sobbing): Wait! Stay close to me.

451
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,222
- Give me your hand.

452
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,330
It's okay.

453
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,903
It's okay.

454
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,570
(Sarah gasping)

455
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:26,868
What?

456
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,311
(softly): What?

457
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:36,783
(generator humming)

458
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,877
- That wasn't on before.

459
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,003
(generator humming)

460
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,712
(Sarah shrieking)

461
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:52,518
(humming)

462
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,028
- They took him.
(sniffling)

463
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,400
- I'm sorry, Sarah,
we looked everywhere.

464
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:44,941
(generator stopping)

465
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,709
(Peter breathing shakily)

466
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,612
- Uncle Peter.

467
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,176
Uncle Peter...
(loud thud)

468
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,413
(Sarah screaming)
Uncle Peter!

469
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:56,616
(Sarah gasping)

470
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,264
(camera clicking)

471
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,700
(Sarah crying)

472
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,130
(pool balls clicking)

473
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,231
(Sarah sobbing)

474
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,574
(door creaking)

475
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,310
(rattling)

476
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,180
(Sarah screaming)

477
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,984
(running footsteps)

478
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,987
(Sarah whimpering)

479
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,299
(screaming)

480
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,506
(dropping camera)

481
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,938
(whimpering)

482
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,565
(generator switching on)

483
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,921
(pool balls clicking)

484
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:24,431
(man): That's good. That's right.

485
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,202
Just like that.

486
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,113
Good. It's okay.

487
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,707
(camera clicking)

488
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:40,914
Yeah. It's just a little game
we're playing.

489
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,586
Nice.

490
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,865
Don't be shy.

491
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,604
(ice cubes tinkling)

492
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,481
Hmm.

493
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,810
That wasn't so bad.

494
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:14,081
Hmm? Was it?

495
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,260
How about a little snack now?

496
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,238
(dragging)

497
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:43,980
(dragging continues)

498
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,336
(groaning softly)

499
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,235
(Sarah breathing shakily)

500
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,520
(rumbling)

501
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,049
(water running)

502
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:41,919

503
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,526

505
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:10,348

506
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,029
(bottles clinking)

507
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,692
(gasping)

508

511
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:37,469
(girl crying out)

512
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,267
(ice cubes tinkling)
(girl): No!

513
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,475
(panting)

514
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,684
(gasping)
- There you are.

515
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,227
- Sophia. What are you...?

516
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:01,661
- Thought we had a date, didn't we?

517
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,492
(gasping)

518
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,132
Are you looking for this?

519
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,553
- That's not the key to this door.

520
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,189
- That's not the way out.

521
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:45,704
(fire crackling)

522
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,866
- Daddy? Daddy?

523
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,032
What did you do to him?!

524
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,542
- Not nearly enough.

525
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,874
(ice cubes tinkling)

526
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:27,211
Daddy want his favourite drink?

527
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,541
No? I think he's gonna need it.

528
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:33,384
- Who are you?
Why are you doing this to us?

529
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,790
- You have trouble remembering, Sarah.

530
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:38,723
You have holes up here.

531
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,404
You have the key.

532
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:38,943
(dragging)

533
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,486
(dragging continues)

534
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,652
- Did I...?

535
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:21,662
No...

536
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,027
- Finish what you started.
- No.

537
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,869
Leave us alone!
- Ah!

538
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,238
Stop punishing yourself, Sarah.

539
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,371
Sarah, plea--
- Shhh...

540
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:12,579
You have to be quiet,
or you're gonna wake up Mommy.

541
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:15,046
And then I'll have to punish you.

542
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,827
So you want to play with me now?

543
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,326
- Honey...
- Shhh!

544
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:29,759
(groaning)

545
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:33,231
- Why are you making such a big deal?
It's just a game. Don't be such a baby.

546
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:35,133
- Don't... Don't...

547
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,732
- Please stop! Please stop!

548
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:44,905
Ow, Daddy, it hurts.

549
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,443
(sobbing)
It hurts.

550
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:51,075
(John): Daddy would never hurt you.

551
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:52,984
- Liar!!!

552
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:57,782
Look. Look at what you did.
Look at what you did to me!

553
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,917
How could you?!

554
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,294
(John): Look at what you did.

555
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:08,801
Sarah... honey...

556
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,804
you're seeing things...

557
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,805
...people that aren't there.

558
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,776
You're making things up that didn't happen.

559
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:22,613
But we can get through this, baby.

560
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:26,144
You're gonna have to do what I say.
Okay?

561
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:30,485
I can help you,
but you're gonna have to untie me first.

562
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,360
Sweetie...

563
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:38,698
Honey?

564
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,503
It's okay. It's okay.

565
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:47,805
Come on. That's right.

566
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:55,041
Just take it easy.
Just take it easy.

567
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,877
(gasping)
Oh, God. Thank you.

568
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,647
Now just give these to me.

569
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:03,491
All right. All right.

570
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,157
Okay.

571
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,493
(drops clippers)

572
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,663
(softly): Honey, it's all right.

573
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,566
It's okay. It's okay.

574
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:23,503
All right. You okay?

575
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,051
(Sarah weeping)

576
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:44,255
- No, Daddy! Ow!

577
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,861
- You're making me do this, Sarah.
- No!

578
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:48,434
(weeping)

579
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:53,598
(Peter): John...

580
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:04,284
Just leave her alone.

581
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,047
- Leave her alone?

582
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:15,259
Just shut up, Peter.

583
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:19,060
Shut up and enjoy the show, huh?

584
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,433
(Sarah screaming)
Just like you always did. Huh?

585
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,561
Right, Sarah?
- Let her go!

586
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,136
- "Let her go." What is this, a joke?

587
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,076
- Ah! Ah!

588
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,969
- You're such a loser.

589
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,071
(Peter groaning)

590
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:36,812
Pretending to be dead.

591
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,249
And then you attack me?

592
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,951
(panting)

593
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:50,129
- This'll be our special little secret.

594
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:00,965
(Peter): Oh, God.

595
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:03,843
Oh, God, Sarah. Please.

596
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:06,513
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

597
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:09,679
It was so long ago.

598
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:13,016
I should've stopped it,
I should've stopped him.

599
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,153
(sniffling)
