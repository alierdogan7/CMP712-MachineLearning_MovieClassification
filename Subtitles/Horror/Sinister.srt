00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,850
- Just one box?
- It's for my office. It's fragile.

00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,103
Sissy.

(LOUD MUSIC THROUGH HEADPHONES)
- Hey, dude, headphones.

5
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,276
You're gonna go deaf!

6
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,433
An autograph?

7
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,314
- I just thought that...
- Are you kidding me?

8
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,366
Ma'am?

9
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,616
- Sheriff.
- Your husband around?

10
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,332
MAN: Ashley?

11
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,285
Ashley?

12
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,704
Honey.

13
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,497
Sweetheart.

14
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,338
- What are you doing?
- Painting.

15
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,003
Yeah. I know. I think your mom
wants your help unpacking.

16
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,297
I know.

17
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,849
So come outside.
You can finish your painting later.

18
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,886
I didn't wanna move here.
I shouldn't have to carry boxes.

19
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,228
We had to move here
and we all have to help carry boxes.

20
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,769
- Uh-uh. You wanted to move here.
- No, I had to move here.

21
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,233
The new story I'm writing is here.

22
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,524
Why can't you just keep writing
in the old house?

23
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,365
'Cause I was gonna have to write college
textbooks to pay for that old house.

24
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,121
- And I can't do that.
- Why not?

25
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,625
- 'Cause I just can't.
- But I miss my school.

26
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,003
Well, you know what? The school here
is supposed to be pretty great.

27
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,130
But I want my old one.

28
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,420
I know. How about this, all right?
I'll tell you what.

29
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,132
If we don't like it here,
once I sell my book, we'll move back.

30
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,802
But only if we don't like it here.

31
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,016
- Really?
- Really.

32
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,271
You promise?

33
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,400
I promise. But you have to promise
to try to like it here.

34
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,481
- I promise.
- You do? Now, my little artist.

35
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,442
- What's the number one rule?
- Paint only goes in the bedroom.

36
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,733
- Where doesn't it go?
- Anywhere else in the house.

37
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,819
Right. OK, now, come with me.
Move some boxes.

38
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,948
Sheriff's here.

39
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,085
- Already?
- Play nice this time.

40
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,745
- I'm always nice.
- I'm not kidding.

41
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,132
I'm tired of driving five miles under
the speed limit to get ticketed anyway.

42
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,634
Be nice.

43
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,055
Afternoon. Is there a problem?

44
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,262
No, sir. Just a friendly visit.

45
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,347
I appreciate that. Ellison Oswalt.

46
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,138
I know who you are.

47
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,807
- So you're not a fan.
- No.

48
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,476
Well, what can I do for you?

49
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,692
Well, not much, I expect,
unless I can convince you

50
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:17,280
to load those boxes back on that truck
and leave as soon as you're able.

51
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,365
No, I don't think so,
but, you know what.

52
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,826
I do have a couple of extra copies
of <i>Kentucky Blood</i>

53
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,366
if you want me to get one out
and sign it for you.

54
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,582
- No, thank you, sir.
- Is it the writing?

55
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,420
More a matter of content. You don't seem
to care much for our profession.

56
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,960
Not everybody in your profession
gets it right.

57
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,595
I've read your books. Neither do you.

58
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,971
- Look...
- You got it right in <i>Kentucky Blood.</i>

59
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,307
I'll give you that.
It's a fine piece of writing.

60
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,349
But <i>Cold Denver Morning</i>,
you got it wrong.

61
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,893
<i>- Blood Diner...</i>
- Look, that wasn't my fault. All right?

62
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,732
Your bad theory helped a killer go free.
You ruined people's lives.

63
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,777
Now, this town doesn't need that.
It needs to heal. It needs to forget.

64
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,492
We sure don't want that circus
that you bring with you.

65
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,531
Well, there's a missing girl
involved here.

66
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,669
- She ain't missing. She's dead.
- Come on. You don't know that.

67
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,372
If that girl is still alive,
then it ain't no miracle

68
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,006
and we ain't ever gonna find her.

69
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,542
Then I guess
we should just let it go, huh?

70
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,054
You don't think the town
deserves an explanation?

71
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,592
Something like this... You can
never explain something like this.

72
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,772
And if you were able to, the odds are
you wouldn't much care for the answer.

73
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,228
Now, we did our job. You'll see that.

74
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,988
And this is just another waste
of your time like your last two books.

75
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,566
If writing true crime
has taught me one thing.

76
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,203
It's that whenever an officer of the law
tells me that I'm wasting my time,

77
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,784
it just means
he thinks he's wasting his.

78
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,826
That's clever.
You ought to write that down.

79
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,586
Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb

80
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,123
and assume your department
is not at my disposal?

81
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,886
Well, what do you know? You can still
get things right on occasion.

82
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,980
Oh, and... I find this to be
in extremely bad taste.

83
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,866
- What was all that about?
- The usual.

84
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,323
He wanted an autograph,
but he left his copy at home.

85
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,204
- He'll be back later.
- That bad?

86
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,786
- Mm-hm.
- Why was he pointing at the house?

87
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,959
Ellison, we didn't move in a few houses
down from a crime scene again, did we?

88
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,631
- Tracy...
- No, just don't say anything.

89
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,884
If we did, I don't wanna know about it.

90
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,550
- We didn't.
- You promise?

91
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,259
I promise.

92
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,848

93
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,231
It's gonna be good here, OK?
You'll see.

Enjoy, kids. We're not likely
to be able to eat out much this time.

103

- Oh!
- Why not?

104
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,082
- You know why.
- I don't.

105
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,750
We haven't sold the old house yet.

106
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,636
Once it's gone, well be able to afford
a few extra things.

107
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,093
Then sell it already.
Lower the price if you have to.

108
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,553
We've already lowered it
as much as we can.

109

The market's terrible. Once we're not
paying two mortgages, we'll be fine.

00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,939
And once I sell my new book,
we'll be on Easy Street.

111
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,193
- Is the story a good one this time?
- Yeah, it's good. Of course it is.

- Will you show me where it happened?
- Trevor.

I'm old enough to know about this stuff.

No, youre not. Even I'm not old enough
to know about this stuff.

Your father writes
about terrible, terrible things.

116
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,746
- I shouldn't be writing about it?
- That's not what I meant.

117
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,578
That's the way you said it.

118
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,663
I'm gonna hear about it
at school anyway.

119

Kids'll all hate me again
and tell me nonstop what happened.

- Hey, nobody hates you.
- I might as well hear it from you.

121

- Are you listening to this?
- Yes. I'm listening.

122
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,345
Let's at least make sure
your office stays locked.

123

It's one thing to hear about it,
another to see it.

I don't want him walking in again.
He's 12.

- Mom, he knows how old I am.
- Hey, stop it.

126
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,847
- What's the first rule?
ALL: - Never go in Dad's office.

127
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,265
And what's the rule?

128
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,980
- Always lock Dad's office.
- That's right.

129

about why we're here, from anybody.

00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,568
Yeah.

131
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,574
You didn't brush your teeth.

- No. not yet.
- You're not coming to bed?

133
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,877
No, I thought I'd set up my office first
and get started.

- How long is it gonna be?
- Just an hour or two.

No, I mean...
how long are we here for this time?

Oh, God' I don't know.
It could be along one.

00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,014

(CHUCKLES)

139
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,181
- Nobody likes my fiction.
- Maybe you should try again.

00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,020
I can't do this without you by my side.

141
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,232
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm on your side.

142
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,857
I just wanna see you
enjoying your work again.

When you're happy... we're all happy.

144
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,952
I just need another hit, that's all.

145
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,164
- Just one more.
- I just...

146
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,252
What?

147
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,508
- You know I'm behind you on this.
- I know.

148
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,591
But that's not what you were gonna say.
What were you gonna say?

149
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,848
<i>Kentucky Blood</i> was ten years ago.

150
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,474
And?

151
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,434
And... what if that was your 15 minutes?

152
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,813
OK, what if it was?

153
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:11,106
If it was, you can't just spend
the rest of your life chasing after it.

154
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,196
If you miss out on these years
with the kids, you won't get them back.

that's all, one more.

156
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,327
- OK. good.
- I got a good feeling about this.

157
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,455
But, Ell,
I don't think I can do this again.

158
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,666
- Honey, you're not gonna have to.
- No. I mean it.

159
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,129
If this goes sour like last time.

160
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,091
I'll take Trevor and Ashley
and go back home to my sister's.

161
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,634
- Is that fair?
- Yes.

162
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,189
But it's not gonna go sour.

163
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,602

- Not really.

332
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,807
- I'm not really a squirrel guy.
- Really?

333
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:43,143
I did kill a scorpion
when we first moved in here. though,

334
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,979
so maybe I should get an exterminator.

335
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:49,362
Scorpions have feet. but you wouldn't
hear 'em like you would squirrels.

336
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,403
Well, Officer, thank you very much.

337
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:57,116
It's... I will... If there's
anything else I can do for you...

338
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,999
Actually, there is. I left my copy
of <i>Kentucky Blood</i> down at the station.

339
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,125
It'd really mean a lot to me
if you signed a copy.

340
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:07,380
- I got a few extra copies in my office.
- Thank you so much. That's so great.

00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,468
Wow. Do you know what? This is like
one of them FBI profiler's offices.

343
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,760
Deputy. I need you to step outside.
This is my private office. I'm serious.

344
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,724
- Just wait outside.
- Mr Oswalt. listen.

345
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,765
You know there's a page in your books

346
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,276
where you always say nice things about
all the people that helped you out?

347
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,778
- The acknowledgements?
- Yeah. well...

348
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:34,737
Yeah, and in each one there's always
like a line that says, you know.

349
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,402
"I couldn't have done this
without the tireless efforts

you know, if you don't already have one.

354
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,464
Yeah, there are a few things
you could do for me, actually.

355
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,299
- Really?
- Yeah. this could be perfect.

356
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,555
- Do you have a notepad?
- Um...

357
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,394
- Yes.
- All right. Do you need a pen?

358
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,354
Yes.

359

I need the street address of a crime.

360
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,856
In 1998, St Louis,
a family was stabbed to death.

361
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,488
They had their throats out.
It was a pretty ugly affair.

362
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,571
I also need any details you can get me
on another murder,

363
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,111
1979, a family was burned alive,

364
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,656
parked inside their own car,
in their own garage.

365
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,620
- What city?
- I don't know.

366
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,501
All I have is the year
and the method of execution.

367
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,880
Hmm. You think
that the two cases are related?

368
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:36,340
- Oh, no, no. I'm just doing research.
- OK. I can definitely get this for you.

369
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:40,177

leaves the office, but I will get it.

and I took it out on you.

01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:08,151
I've taken my fair share
of forensic science courses.

491
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:13,570
I also know a series of connected
murders when I see one, Mr Oswalt.

492
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,454
- Look...
- We missed something. I get that.

493
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,787
But if you want me to run interference
for you while you get this worked out.

494
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,830
I gotta be in the loop
just a little bit.

495
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:29,380
- You really wanna help?
- It's my home, Mr Oswalt.

496
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,171
What happened here
happened to all of us.

497
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,260
All right. Come here.

498
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,401
Who is that?

499
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,689
I don't know.
That's what I'm hoping to find out.

500
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,277
- You think these are serial murders?
- Maybe.

501
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,913
More ritualized than necessarily serial.
But really spread out.

502
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:03,794
And not just regionally but over time.
The first one dates back to the '60s.

503
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:07,001
- The 1960s?
- Yeah.

504
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,508
That would put the guy,
what, in his 70s?

505
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,215
- Yeah. or his 60s.
- Yeah, I...

506
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:15,221
- I don't know.
- Well, look at the methodology.

507
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,884
Toxicology reports. some cases
the killer drugged his victims.

508
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,805
- With what?
- Well, they couldn't tell for sure.

509
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:27,192
But by drugging them, the killer
removes his need to overpower them.

510
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,603
Here he used a tree branch
to do the heavy lifting.

511
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:33,273
In Sacramento he lit a family on fire.
In St Louis he slit their throats.

512
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,444
- The first family he drowned.
- Drowning? You...

513
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,079
You never said anything
about anyone being drowned.

514
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,706
The only other significant link
between the murder cases

515
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:46,086
is that in each instance the killer
murdered the entire family except one.

516
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,246
A child which he took with him.

517
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:54,011
That and this symbol appears
in several of the crime scenes.

518
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,264
That looks like something
from out of the occult.

519
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,892
Look' you might wanna
call the university.

520
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,349
There's a professor over there.
Professor Jonas.

521
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,763
He's an occult crime expert

522
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,651
and the state police bring him in
on some of the... the weirder stuff.

523
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,731
I think this qualifies.

524
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,989
(SIGHS) So where do you think
that drowning happened?

525
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,525
That's what I need you to find out.

526
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,156
OK.

528
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,130
- Professor Jonas?
<i>- Yes.</i>

529
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,801
Hello. Hey, thank you for getting back
to me so quickly. I appreciate that.

530
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,767
<i>Of course, I'm a really big fan.
I'm flattered that you emailed.</i>

531
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,477
Once I saw the photos that you sent,

532
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,314
I knew exactly
what cases you were studying.

533
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,067
Wait. How would you know
what cases I was looking at?

534
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:03,951
<i>The symbol that you sent me is...
isn't a pentagram.</i>

535
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:06,111
<i>It's not something
that you would see teenagers</i>

536
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:10,703
<i>or a Norwegian black metal band paint
on a wall in goat's blood to be edgy.</i>

537
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,538
- Right.
<i>- Or to piss off the Christians..</i>

538
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,579
<i>No, this is a little bit more obscure
than that.</i>

539
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,545
<i>I know the one in the hallway,</i>

540
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:23,462
<i>that's from the late '90s in St Louis.</i>

541
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,264
<i>The other one, the... the car hood,</i>

542
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,097
<i>that is from Sacramento,
that's about 30 years ago.</i>

543
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,011
Tell me about the one in Sacramento.

544
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:35,478
<i>It's a symbol associated
with the worship of a pagan deity.</i>

545
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,358
A deity? What kind of deity?

546
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,613
<i>A very obscure one,
dating back to Babylonian times.</i>

547
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,321
<i>Named Bughuul, the eater of children.</i>

548
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:50,956
- Did you say eater?
<i>- Yes, of children. Thank you, Jessica.</i>

549
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,787
<i>The crimes that you're dealing with.</i>

550
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,372
<i>They all have the element
of a missing child, correct?</i>

551
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,038
Yes. Yeah. That's correct.

552
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,333
<i>Well, Bughuul eats children.</i>

553
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,127
<i>Now, the fragments of stories
that have survived,</i>

554
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:09,683
<i>they all revolve around him needing
the souls of human children to survive.</i>

555
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:13,937
<i>Now, each story involves a different way</i>

556
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:19,317
<i>that he lures or tricks these children
away from the physical world</i>

557
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,650
<i>and traps them in his own netherworld</i>

558
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,861
<i>and he consumes their souls over time.</i>

559
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:30,746
<i>Now, any worship of this deity
would include a blood sacrifice</i>

560
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,578
<i>or the wholesale eating of a child.</i>

561
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:38,462
So you're saying the person that made
this symbol is... is eating children?

562
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,588
<i>Well, that would fit the stories.</i>

563
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:44,377
<i>Of course, the few times
that this symbol has shown up,</i>

564
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,842
<i>none of the crimes have been related
in any way to any of this.</i>

565
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,224
<i>So this might be
more of a cult initiation</i>

566
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:55,478
<i>rather than, you know,
the actual actions of any one man.</i>

567
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,601
<i>There's been another one, hasn't there?</i>

568
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,866
I think so, yes.

569
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,026
<i>Tell me everything you can.</i>

- I appreciate you coming by, Officer.
- Oh, yeah, it's not a problem at all.

- So we're becoming friends. right?

something in earnest.

581
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,644
You wouldn't read too much into it?

582
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,063
Um... All right.

583
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:28,702
Was there anything... weird
about the Stevensons?

584
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:35,003
No complaints from them
about anything... strange?

585
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,540
No, not to my knowledge.

586
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,676
The investigators. did they notice
anything odd or inexplicable

587
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,259
about the house, any...
any weird stories?

588
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,048
No.

589
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,351
Mr Oswalt. is there something
that you wanna tell me?

590
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:59,228
Clearly something happened and you wanna
talk to somebody about it, right?

591
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,940
Yeah.

592
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,323
OK, well, does your wife
know about it?

593
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:06,576
Wait.

594
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:12,783
Does she know
whose house this is... was?

596
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:22,884
Oh, man. Oh, that is a conversation
that I would not wanna be around for.

597
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,589
- No, me neither.
- I'm sorry.

598
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:30,259
So... So, what, you saw something weird,
heard something spooky in the house?

599
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,354
- Yes. Precisely.
- What exactly?

600
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,983

601
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:44,610
I don't believe in any, you know, stuff.

602
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:48,902
Stuff? You mean the supernatural,
the metaphysical, the paranormal.

603
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,196
- That type of stuff?
- Right.

604
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:52,955
Right. Of course you don't.

605
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,458
You never would have moved
into a crime scene if you did.

606
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,836
But here we are
having this conversation.

607
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,965
Yeah, but... but there was...

608
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:07,880
there was none of that, you know,
none of that with the Stevensons, huh?

609
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,925
No. In the short amount of time
that the Stevensons lived here,

610
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,015
they never called the police,
they never had the police called on them

611
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:18,647
or reported anything bizarre
that came up in the investigation.

612
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,730

- Yes.

(SIGHS)

614
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:29,075
I think that you moved yourself
into the house of murder victims

615
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:32,203
and immediately set about trying
to put yourself in their head space.

616
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,991
I also think that you've begun
discovering things about this case

617
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:40,003
that go to darker places
than you were prepared for.

618
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,789
I also think that every time
that I've been to your house.

619
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,504
There's a whisky bottle
that doesn't appear to be neglected.

620
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:49,296
- No, no, no. I...
- Mr Oswalt. listen. I don't. I don't...

621
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,932
I'm not saying that you have
a drinking problem. I don't think that.

622
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,764
Nor do I think
that you're making any of this up...

623
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,724
- No!
- ...to get attention.

624
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:01,357
What I do think is that...
that you are under so much stress.

625
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,483
You've put yourself
under so much stress.

626
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:07,863
That your mind
is trying to process all of it at once.

627
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:13,321
So you don't believe
any of that otherworldly stuff, right?

628
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:16,956
Are you kidding me?
I believe in all that stuff.

629
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,163
I... I wouldn't sleep one night
in this place. Are you nuts?

630
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,296
Four people were hung by their necks
in the tree in your backyard

631
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,378
and that little girl
is probably God knows wherever.

632
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:30,295
- OK.
- I'm... I'm sorry. You know what?

633
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:34,557
You should try and get out more,
Mr Oswalt, try to clear your head.

634
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:39,103
Total honesty?

635
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:47,396
Last night
I thought something was in the house...

636
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:51,987
...and I woke up on the couch
holding a baseball bat.

637
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:58,326
Well... I guess if I thought
something was in my home at night.

638
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,207
I'd be a little bit freaked out too.

639
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:04,997
But, listen, Mr Oswalt,
if you sleep in this house.

640
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,836
It's just gonna do
terrible things to your head.

641
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,555
TRACY: Ellison!

642
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,340
- Ellison!
- What's going on?

643
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:20,478
Your daughter thought there wasn't
room on her walls for her new painting.

644
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,388
- Ashley!
- No, that's not it.

645
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,683
What did we talk about?
We only gave you one rule.

646
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:27,227
It was a big deal for us
to let you paint on your walls.

647
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:30,067
- What's the rule, Ashley?
- Paint only goes in the bedroom.

648
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,231
And what makes you think
you can paint out here?

649
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:34,992
I wanted to paint her picture,
but she didn't want it in my room

650
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,495
because that used to be
her brother's room.

651
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,202
What? Who are you talking about?

653

She used to live here. She's the one
Daddy's writing his book about.

654
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,463
Ashley, go to your room
and shut the door.

655

Did you think I wouldn't find out?

Shh. Of course I knew you were
gonna find out eventually, OK?

657

if we were living near the house!

two houses down from a crime scene.

661
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,908
- Don't you dare!
- I said no.

662
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,543
- We never should have come here!
- Tracy, nobody died here.

663
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:29,042
It's not like were sleeping
where somebody was killed

664
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,674
or they had to wipe blood
off the walls for the open house.

665
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:35,336
- You're saying it didn't happen here?
- No. It happened in the backyard.

666
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:39,006
Oh, that is so sick!
God. you think that makes a difference?

667
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,471

- No, Ellison. It doesn't.

668
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,682
You have done
some crazy shit in the past.

669

670

possessed you to move here?

671
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,480
- We've never been this broke before.
- That's no excuse.

672
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,561
This place came on the market.
It was a steal.

673
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,402
Gee, I wonder why.

674
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,568
So what Trevor drew last week,
that happened here?

675
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,074
Yes.

676
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:05,788
The previous owners of this home
were hung from a tree in our backyard?

677
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,419
- Yes.
- That is so sick. Ellison.

678
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,921
And you let our little girl
play back there?

679
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,127
Why shouldn't I?

680
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,337

681
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,719
and drawing pictures
of this crime at school.

682
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:19,096
And our daughter just painted
a dead girl on our wall.

683
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,758
She's missing.
Technically she's missing.

684
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,302
I don't wanna hear about technicalities.

what you've done,

686
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:29,269

your children in, your marriage?

687
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,523
Yes, I do!

688
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:34,483
Is there anything you won't do
for your goddamn book?

689
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:40,155
Apparently not.
I guess this is all worth it to you.

690
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,411
- It's worth it.
- Putting your family at risk.

691
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,573
- Risk of what? Of more paintings?
- Don't. Your daughter...

692
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,412
My daughter has a father who loves her,

693

who is always around,
who encourages her to be herself.

694
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,542
The worst thing
that has ever happened to her

695
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:55,458
is one time she moved into a house
where a family was killed.

696
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,719
She found out about the murders,
so she felt sorry for the little girl.

697
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,175
So she painted a fucking picture!

698
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:04,808
That's what she does.
It's what she always has done.

699

- What else do you want from me?

700
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:11,474
How about a home
where we feel safe, Ellison?

701
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,642
How about neighbours that don't hate us

702
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,609
in a town where I can buy groceries
without getting strange looks?

703
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,490
How about a life
that doesn't involve our kids

704
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:24,324
drawing and painting the sick details
of some horrific tragedy

705
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:27,122
or working out
their deep-seated anxieties

706
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,908
by doing bizarre shit in the night?

707
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:33,045
- How about that? Would that be OK?
- I can give all that to you, I can!

708
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:36,798
- Just when I finish the book!
- This book isn't for us. It's for you.

709
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,880
Tracy, don't say that. That's not true.

710
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:42,092
It is true. There are plenty of other
ways you can provide for this family.

816
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:45,035
- What's the problem?
<i>- OK, the problem is that you moved.</i>

817
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,958
How is that a problem?

818
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,539
<i>I was compiling all of the data
that you had me collecting</i>

819
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:52,626
<i>and once I started putting it together
into a nice readable package.</i>

820
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:54,336
<i>I saw the connection, it was obvious.</i>

821
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,378
- What was it?
<i>- The dates, the addresses.</i>

822
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:59,136
<i>Each family that you had me look up</i>

823
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:03,596
<i>had previously lived in the house where
one of the earlier murders took place.</i>

824
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,102
Each family? All five of them?

825
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:09,561
<i>Yes, and when you put them
in chronological order,</i>

826
01:36:09,722 --> 01:36:12,817
<i>you can actually draw a line
from murder to murder to murder.</i>

827
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:15,274
<i>OK, we knew
that the Stevensons previously lived</i>

828
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:18,815
<i>in the same St Louis house
where the Millers had their throats cut,</i>

829
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:20,484
<i>Before the Miller family was killed,</i>

830
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:22,820
<i>the Millers lived in the same house
in Orange County</i>

831
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:25,114
<i>where the De Luzio
lawn massacre occurred.</i>

832
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,409
<i>Guess where the De Luzios lived
before they moved to Orange County?</i>

833
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:31,794
Sacramento where the Martinez family
was burned in their garage?

834
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:35,924
<i>Exactly. The pattern goes back
to the 1966 Oregon drownings.</i>

835
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:39,086
<i>Listen, Mr Oswalt, you just moved out
of the last house in line.</i>

836
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:41,004
<i>If this guy is still out there,</i>

837
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:45,050
<i>you not only just sped up his timeline,
you put yourself in it.</i>

838
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:48,520
Thanks, Deputy.

839
01:37:29,802 --> 01:37:30,974
Stephanie.

840
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:54,165
It's the missing kids.

841
01:38:50,633 --> 01:38:52,727
(GROANS)

842
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:19,534
I like that you made the movies longer.
They're better this way.
