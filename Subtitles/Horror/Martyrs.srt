Man on radio:
Squad en route. ETA two minutes.

Man #2 on radio:
Proceed with caution. Over.

12
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,251
You sure it's the building?

13
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,966
It's the one
the girl pointed out.

14
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,121
( Man yells )
Clear!

15
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,608
Whoever was in here,
they didn't leave any scraps.

16
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,489
- Nothing.
- Man #2: Clear!

17
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,687
She was scared.

18
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,569
Man #3: Clear!

19
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,529
Could've just pointed out
the wrong building?

20
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,729
Yeah. Maybe.

21
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,440

00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,725
Hi. I'm Anna.

25
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,085
You're Lucie, right?

26
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,323
That's what the sisters said.

27
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,403
Do you wanna play
or something?

28
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,770
Okay. Bye.

29
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,447
( Anna whispering )
Now I lay me down to sleep,

30
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,410
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

31
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,130
If I die before I wake...

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,411
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

33
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,925

( sobbing )

36
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,001
Lucie.
Lucie, there's no one there.

37
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,730
Lucie, calm down.
It's okay.

38
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,042
No one's going to hurt you, dear.

39
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,964
Sisters, please, I need help!

40
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,488
( Lucie continues screaming )

41
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,927

00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,603
<i>He'! '</i>

44
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,963
I sneak into the kitchen when
Sister Rachel was doing her beads.

45
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,171
They're still warm.

46
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,769
Man: The sisters say you've
become good friends with Lucie.

47
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,681
Does she ever
say anything about, uh--

48
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,489
about the people
that hurt her?

49
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,726
No.

50
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,164
What kind of things
does Lucie tell you about, Anna?

51
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,285
It's okay, child.
You can tell him.

52
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,007
She talks
about monsters a lot.

53
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,764
She said
they're still out there.

54
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,684
Monsters.

55
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,444
Has Lucie ever told you
what her monsters look like?

56
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,410
(bell tolling)

57
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,082

59
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,761
Hello?

60
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,165
No.

61
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,560
Get out.

62
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,921
Anna?

It's okay.

69
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,007
They're not gonna
hurt you anymore.

70
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,401
It's okay.

71
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,001
Lucie:
No one believes me.

72
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,685

Let it take me
wherever I wanted.

Where would you want to go?

84
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,369
Wherever you go.

(wind blowing )

86
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,163
Do you believe her?

87
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,245
Do you believe the things
Lucie tells you about her monsters?

88
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,810
(whispers )
I don't know.

( TV playing in background )

92
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,602
What's the plan for today?

93
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,364
Well, I'm gonna need
your rooms cleaned

94
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,090
before anyone goes anywhere.

95
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,730
I'm supposed to pick up Kim
in an hour.

96
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,160
Well, I just looked in your room.

97
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,085
You better call and tell her
you're gonna be late, real late.

98
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,811
- No.
- I thought Katy broke up with you.

99
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,008
Huh. Nobody breaks up with me.

100
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,571
See, I don't think
Katy knows that,

101
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,846
and neither does the guy
she was slobbering on

102
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,240
at the lake last night.

103
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,482
- Oh, yeah, you're full of shit.
- Hey!

104
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,641
Oh, he says it all the time.

105
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,131
Oh, not in front of me,
he doesn't.

106
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,089
What's not in front of you?

107
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,730
Brian said I was full of shit.

108
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,086
Oh, well, he's probably right.

110
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,284
Brian, after breakfast,
I'm gonna need your help downstairs.

111
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,010
Mom said I had
to clean my room.

112
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,407
Well, as soon as we're done.

113
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,528
Isn't it Nicole's turn?
You always let her slide.

114

( Doorbell rings )

115
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,762
That's because
I love her more.

116

Nicole: No! No!

117
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,045

How old?!

123
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,968
I'm 17.

124
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,849
Did you know about the things
that your parents did?

125
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,651
Please.

I'm sorry.

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,171
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

( Phone vibrating )

134
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,166
Hello?

135
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,687
Anna?
I found them.

136
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,482
I need you to see them, too.

137
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,045
I need you, Anna.

138
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,689
Tell me where you are.

(chimes tinkling)

140
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,650
Lucie?

141
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,284
Lucie?

142
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,006
Oh, God.

143
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,242
- I didn't have a choice.
- ( gasps )

144
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,841
Lucie, what did you do?

145
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,729
But I had to.

146
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,803
I told you it was them.

147
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,281
No, no, no. You said that
you were gonna show me them.

148
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,885
You-- we were gonna
call the police.

149
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,289
The police? The police
would not have believed us.

150
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,808
And you know that.
They don't care anymore.

151
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,764
Nobody cares anymore.

152
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,209
Except for you and me, Anna.

153
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,730
I want to show you.

154
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,882
- ( Sobbing )
- That's him.

155
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,690
His face has changed
a little bit over the years,

156
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,571
but the eyes--
I know those eyes.

157
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,369
He's the one, Anna.

158
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,881
And her.

159
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,769
It's been too long.
You can't-- you don't know.

160
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,490
- You can't be sure.
- I am.

161
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,042
- Not sure enough to do this.
- It's them!

162
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,525
See.

163
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,127
- They knew.
- They?

164
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,611
The children.

165
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,290
- There's more?
- There's a girl.

166
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,081
Oh, my God.

167
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,288
They knew what their parents
were doing, Anna.

168
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,046
- They're guilty, too.
- No, no. No, they're not.

169
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,807
Anna, you have to believe me.

170
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,928
- You have to believe me. Please?
- No!

171
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,481
Anna, Anna!

172
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,880
Please, please.

173
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,565
Please, believe me.

174
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,523
I'm sorry.

175
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,445
I can't help you anymore.
I'm sorry.

176
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,771
Anna, please?

177
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,721
Anna?

178
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,006
Anna!

179
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,005
(faint whine)

180
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,648
( creaking )

181
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,283
Wait. Please?

182
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,201
L-- I did it.

183
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,045
I did it. It's over.

184
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,448
(whispering )
I stopped them.

185
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,241
It's supposed to be over.

186
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,731
See?

187
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,326
I stopped them. Please.

188
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,801

189
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,121
No!

190
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,965
Stop, please!

191
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,162
Please, stop.

192
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,971
No! Stop, don't!

193
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,441

197
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,130
It's here again, Anna.

198
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,405
It hurt me.

199
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,164
It's okay, it's okay.
I've got you, okay?

200
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,721
I'm not gonna let anything
hurt you anymore, okay?

201
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,810
( Sobbing )

202
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,370
Man: And I say unto thee,
love one another.

203
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,002
Do not treat the stranger
with disdain,

204
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,687
but love him, embrace him,
and take him into your heart.

205
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,161
- ( Lucie whispering ) Anna?
- ( Anna whispering ) What?

206
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,767
- Please don't ever leave me.
- I won't.

207
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,844
- Promise?
- I promise.

208
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,049

Shh! Quiet, girls.

209

...hallowed be thy name.

210
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,363
Thy kingdom come,

211
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,329
thy will be done

212
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,165
on earth as it is in heaven.

213
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,161
Give us today day our daily bread.

214
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,209
For thine is the kingdom

215
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,364
and the power and the glory

216
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,286
forever and ever.

217
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,044
Amen.

218
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,722
Lucie, come on.
We have to go.

219
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,123
You should've seen his face
when he opened the door.

220
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,284
He recognized me, too.
I saw it in his eyes.

221
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,765
Now, Lucie,
before someone comes.

222
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,610
I can't help you here.

223
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,091
We have to get you
to a doctor,

224
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,083
someplace really far away.

225
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,086
After we get rid of the bodies
and clean the house back up.

226
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,480
We don't have time.

227
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,808
No, it's the only way
that it will leave me alone.

228
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,405
L-I have to wipe them away.

229
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,285
I have to make it like
they never existed.

230
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,091
Then it will have to let me go.

231
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,201
It's almost over.

232
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,961
Ready?

233
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,970
What's wrong?

234
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,240
Come here.
Come here, Anna.

235
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,530
- Can you smell that?
- Please stop.

236
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,045
Can you?

237
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,964
I've known that smell
my whole life...

238
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,690
from every time
that he beat me,

239
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,605
every time that he
walked into my cell.

240
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,331
And he told me
how perfect I was.

241
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,451
He told me I was the one
that they'd all been waiting for.

242
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,165
(grunts)

243

(both panting)

244
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,488
We need to get the others.

245
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,681
Why can't we just leave them?

246
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,207
I told you I have to do it.

247
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,483
It's the only way
it'll leave me alone.

248
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,921
I'm so tired.

- we just have to hurry.
- I can't leave my family.

266

You aren't leaving them.
We're just-- we have to go.

Why would you help her?

273
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,123
She didn't deserve to die--

274
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,170
What about all the things
she did to me?

275
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,644
I told you! I told you!

276
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,409
But you wanted her to live
instead of me?

277
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,891
No.

278
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,202
Then why would you
try to save her?

279
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,931
Why would you try to let her
do it all over again?

280
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,003
She wouldn't have hurt you.
I wasn't going to let her.

You're lying!

282

their faces...

that you would
love me again.

367
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,681
You were right
about everything.

368
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,046
( Glass breaks )

369
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,925
- We have to go.
- ( pounding on door)

370
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,605
Upstairs.

371
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,089
( Door splinters, opens )

372
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,366
( lock clicks )

373
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,361
Let's go.

374
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,642
Ready? Here we go.

375
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,641
( Screams )

376
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,045
( car doors close )

377
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,840
This way. Come on.

378
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,048
Come on, hurry.
We have to come on.

379
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,005
Watch it.

380
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,124
There.
Get in there.

381
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,281
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

382
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,130
Get down, get down, get down.
Don't move, don't move.

383
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,089
Shh. Quiet.

384
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,284
Come on, let's go.
Come on, Sam. It's okay.

385
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,287
We have to get to my car.

386
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,601
Move, move!
We're almost there.

387
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,841
Hurry!

388
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,522
( Screaming )

389
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,721
No.

390
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,723
Leave her alone!

391
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,210
Anna!

392
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,850
Stop.

393
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,681
No.

394
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,646
( Birds chirping )

395
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,367
( gasps )

396
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,406
What's your name?

397
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,481
Anna.

398
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,961
What are you doing here, Anna?

399
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,881
Where's Dr. Patterson?

400
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,650
He's dead.

401
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,329
His family...
did you kill them?

402
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,568
You're in a lot of trouble, Anna.

403
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,889
- Did you kill them?
- No.

404
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,326
- Your friend?
- Who are you?

405
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,482
What's her name?

406
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,887
I called the police,
and they're on their way.

407
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,285
Oh,

408
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,043
( chains rattling )

409
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,443
( panting )

410
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,166
(grunts)

411
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,721
Lucie!

412
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,408
God, I'm sorry.

413
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,731
I'm so sorry.

414
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,881
( Gasps )

415
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,927
Lucie!

416
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,645
Lucie!

- ( Drill whirring)
- ( Lucie screaming )

418
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,569
Lucie.

419
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,963
Leave her alone.

420
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,608
(drill whirring)

421
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,330
( Lucie screaming )

422
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,603
( shrieking )
Just fucking leave her alone!

423

( Sobbing )

424
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,766
( sobbing )

425
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,968
- ( Lucie screaming )
- Lucie.

426
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,803
Lucie!

427
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,121
( Sobbing )

428
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,966
Anna: Lucie?

429
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,168
Can you hear me?

430
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,485
Are you there?

431
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,882
Please be there.

432
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,051
I need you to be there.

433
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,481
We are gonna get out of here.
I promise we are.

( Screaming )

437
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,047
Stop! Stop!

438
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,685
3110p!

439
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,007
3110p!

440
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,200
No! Aah! Ah!

441
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,404
3110p!

442
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,723
No, no! no,
No, no, no, no, no!

443
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,684
No!

444
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,890
- ( Crackling )
- ( screaming )

445
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,850

( groans )

448
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,565
( panting )

- ( crackling )
- ( screaming )

450
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,085
( gasps, panting )

451
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,846
Do you want to live, Anna?

452
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,082
( Crackling )

453
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,842
(whimpering )

454
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,082
Open your eyes
if you want to live.

455
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,126
( Crackling )

456
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,281
Ugh!

457
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,011
Open your eyes
if you want to live.

458
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,321
Mm.

459
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,287
You'll get another jolt,
maybe a dozen more.

460
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,048
Open them. You leave them
closed now and you die.

461
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,046
Come on. Come on.

462
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,966
Come on, open them.

463
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,487
No more.

464
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,328
No.
(whimpering )

465
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,806
Anna:
No, no more, please.

466
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,970
- ( Crackling )
- ( Anna screaming )

467
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,205
(Anna shrieking )

468
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,441
The monsters aren't real.

469
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,529
The monsters aren't real.

470
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,840
The monsters aren't real.

471
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,249
You're gonna be
all right, Lucie.

472
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,370
It's almost over now.

473
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,728
One more stage,
and all your suffering will be done.

474
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,641
I'm so glad
you came back to us.

475
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,007
It's gonna be fine,
sweetheart.

476
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,449

( Lucie sobbing )

480
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,409
Please stop.

00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,767
( Distant whimpering )

482
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,207
Please stop.

00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,850
Please stop.

484
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,606

Anna! Anna!

No. N-no.

508
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,606
No, no, no.

509
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,520
Man: Thank you all
for gathering here today.

510
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,490
Please be seated
so we may begin.

511
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,240
(whimpering )

512
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,164
Hello again, Anna.

513
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,767
Help, somebody!

514
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,410
They can't hear you.

515
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,846
Not that it would matter.

516
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,365
They're all aware
of you being here.

517
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,126
What I said about calling
the police was true. I did.

518
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,282
I know.

519
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,842
It was your abbreviated 9-1-1 call
that alerted us.

520
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,288
That and your little excursion
downstairs to see Sam.

521
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,529
All outgoing calls
come through our system.

522
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,809
Without yours, we would've assumed
that the doctor's work with Sam

523
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,325
was proceeding as planned.

524
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,370
So I owe you my gratitude.

525
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,127
Without you, we would never
have gotten our dear Lucie back.

526
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,725
I didn't give her to you.

527
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,490
Of course you did.

528
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,961
What do you want with her?

529
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,440
Her gift, of course.

530
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,444
It's what kept her alive
during the doctor's work

531
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,483
when she was a child.

532
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,284
It's what gave her the strength

533
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,887
to spend all those years
trying to find him.

534
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,371
Lucie is very different,
of course.

535
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,485
But you already knew that,
didn't you, Anna?

536
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,648
You were ready to die back there
in your cell

537
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,246
rather than suffer any longer.

538
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,368
But Lucie is different.

539
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,443
Stronger.

540
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,001
What would kill you or I,

541
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,924
she can survive.

542
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,763
Well, physically, anyway.

543
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,366
Mentally, well...

544
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,889
...the monsters are there.

545
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,601
They've slipped through the cracks
that Dr. Patterson opened.

546
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,162
She's special.

547
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,608
It's easy to create a victim.

548
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,967
You lock a person up
in the dark,

549
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,406
and they begin to suffer.

550
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,642
And then you feed that suffering

551
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,644
methodically,
precisely to make it last.

552
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,246
The subject goes through
a number of states.

553
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,689
And then there is trauma,
and it opens those cracks.

554
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,851
Does Lucie ever see things
that aren't there?

555
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,241
Things that may want to hurt her?

556
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,564
Hmm.

557
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,401
These are victims,
and like you or I,

558
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,728
they reach a breaking point.

559
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,165
Martyrs are so much more.

560
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,209
They're so very rare.

561
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,811
So extraordinary.

562
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,246
Martyrs survive the pain,
the torture,

563
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,970
like our Lucie,

564
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,322
and they refuse to die.

565
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,205
Martyrs endure
the unspeakable sins of the Earth,

566
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,489
and they give themselves up

567
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,530
and transcend
their very being.

568
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,728
You are fucking crazy.

569
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,809
And when the police come,
they're gonna--

570
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,327
Don't speak about things
that you can't possibly understand.

571
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,768
Longsheng Province, 1912.

572
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,331
This woman was accused
of stealing food,

573
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,289
and she was being punished.

574
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,171
This photograph was taken of her
when she was alive.

575
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,084
Look at the eyes.

576
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,527
Juliette Ducier, 1945.

577
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,001
She was a grocer
who slept with a German.

578
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,401
At the time, that didn't sit well
with the French,

579
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,369
and she had to pay.

580
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,602
Her eyes still alive.

581
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,450
Birmingham, 1960.

582
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,443
A woman in the final stages
of cancer

583
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,965
beyond the use of morphine.

584
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,600
She was pronounced dead
a dozen times.

585
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,401
And yet she refused to die.

586
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,325
Again, the eyes.

587
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,962
All of them photographed
when they were alive,

588
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,283
all of them seeing something
in their final breaths.

589
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,289
That's what we're recreating.

590
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,811
And we're so close.

591
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,287
That's our hope with Lucie.

592
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,802
And a few rare others.

593
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,885
( Chanting )

594
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,047
No, no, no.

595
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,010
Don't feel badly for her, Anna.

596
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,448
- She welcomes this now.
- No, no. Don't do this!

597
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,523
( Screaming )

598
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,722
Anna: No! No!

599
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,168
' Stop!
<i>'</i> ( Screaming )

600
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,651
Stop it!

601
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,050
( Sobbing )

602
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,409
- ( screaming )
- Anna: No! No!

603
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,363
You have to look past
the pain, Anna.

604
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,522
- Past the human form.
- No.

605
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,444
To what's behind those eyes,
to what she sees.

606
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,366
- No!
- To that final place after life

607
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,329
that awaits us all.

608
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,363
That's what this is about?

609
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,922
Why you've been torturing
and killing people for years?

610
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,562
It isn't torture
when it's for a higher purpose.

611
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,361
We're developing their gift,
expanding their knowledge.

612
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,090
And these people
are here to see this?

613
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,205
They're looking for the answer
to the human race's greatest mystery.

614
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,441
We all are.

615
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,251
So you murder
for their entertainment?

616
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,166
I sacrifice for knowledge.

617
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,928
Why are you
showing me this?

618
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,562
I'd hoped to send you on your way
with some peace, Anna.

619
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,121
In appreciation
for your returning Lucie

620
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,282
to where she belonged.

621
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,880
Unfortunately,
I can't give you that, Anna.

622
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,811
No! N-no!

623
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,849
Bury her with the family.

624
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,809
And make the final preparations
for Lucie.

625
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,088
(whimpering )

626
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,848
( gasps )

627
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,721
( footsteps passing )

628
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,560
( gasps )

629
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,325
( engine starts )

630
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,005
( gasping )

631
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,321
No.

632
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,845
(dirt rushing)

633
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,366
( gasps )

634
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,569
(whimpering )

635
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,651
Exactly as Dr. Patterson
would've done it.

636
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,922
( Lucie gasping, moaning )

637
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,170
( gulps, panting )

638
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,569
(moaning )

639
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,920
( hyperventilating )

640
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,122
( flies buzzing )

641
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,521
(Anna coughs )

642
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,920
( groans )

643
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,683
(groaning )

644
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,847
( panting )

645
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,209
( hyperventilating )

646
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,844
( sobbing )

647
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,880
( screams )

648
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,805
( hyperventilating )

649
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,406
( screaming )

650
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,208
( distant screaming )

651
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,081
( screaming continues )

652
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,765
( panting )

653
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,771
( screaming continues )

654
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,248
( distant voices )

655
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,282
(voices chanting )

656
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,890
( Anna screaming )

657
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,405
(grunts)

658
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,883
(yells )

659
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,402
(grunting )

660
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,171
Hey!

661
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,765
Stand up.

662
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,365
- Turn around.
- ( screams )

663
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,968
( shells clatter)

664
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,406
( panting )

665
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,881
Lucie?

666
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,725
Lucie?

667
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,251
( Anna screams )

668
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,402
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
I have to find my friend.

669
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,562
I'll come back for you.

670
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,881
Lucie?

671
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,605
Where is she?

672
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,125
Drop it.

673
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,328
Put it down.

674
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,289
Kill him!

675
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,682
Samantha: Anna!

676
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,727
(yells )

677
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,961
Anna!

678
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,528
Anna!

679
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,684
- ( Keysjingling)
- Anna!

680
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,403
I'm getting you out of here.

681
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,606
Ready?

682
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,405
I have to stay
and find my friend.

683
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,404
I need you to run, Sam,
as fast as you can.

684
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,688
Find a house, get someone
and tell them about this place.

685
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,251
Please.
(whimpers )

686
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,401
It'll be okay.

687
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,561
(whimpers )

688
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,041
You won't have to be scared,
not anymore, okay?

689
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,851
Go! Go! Go!

690
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,884
This is the one.

691
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,526
It has to be her.
It has to be.

692
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,450
(Anna panting )

693
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,489
- ( yells )
- ( screams )

694
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,883
( screaming )

695
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,561
Lucie.

696
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,721
Help.

697
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,401
Help!

698
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,962
(whimpering )

699
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,761
Man: Oh, Lord, we rejoice
in the suffering of thy child.

700
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,763
Through her pain,
may we truly know

701
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,809
the mysteries that are yours.

702
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,086
- Through our--
- ( gunshots )

703
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,083
( screaming )

704
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,611
Get away from her.

705
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,926
Take her down.

706
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,285
Lucie. Lucie.

707
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,441
Lucie.

708
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,167
Man: She's there.

709
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,651
She sees. I'm sure of it.

710
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,131
Take her down!

711
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,126
Lucie!

712
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,689
Lucie.

713
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,126
Man: She's there.

714
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,161
Take her down.

715
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,482
No. You could push her
past the point of endurance.

716
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,971
Take her down!

717
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,523
You'll let her die in vain.

718
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,841
Stay away from her!

719
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,685
All of her pain
will have been worth nothing.

720
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,525
She knows the answer
the rest of the world

721
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,170
has fought
countless battles over.

722
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,647
- Shut up!
- Destroyed civilizations.

723
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,609
Please don't waste her suffering!

724
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,807
( Screaming )

725
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,281
Man: She's trying to speak.

726
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,443
Could you...

727
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,160
(whispering )

728
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,041
- ( voices whispering )
- Man: Can you hear what she's saying?

729
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,884
- Man #2: What is it?
- Man #3: Is she describing it?

730
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,408
- Man #4: I've got to find out.
- Woman: What did she see?

731
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,769
What did she say?
She was there, wasn't she?

732
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,681
I heard her.

733
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,881
(gunshot)

734
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,042
Father!

735
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,767
What did she say?
She was there, wasn't she?

736
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,081
What did she say?

737
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,369
What was it?
What did she see?

738
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,130
You tell me.

739
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,281
(gunshot)

740
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,608
( screaming )

741
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,410
( groans )

742
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,284
( sirens wailing )

743
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,529
I'm so sorry.

744
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,451
(girls laughing )

745
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,480
I wish I could ride a cloud.

746
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,086
Let it take me wherever I wanted.

747
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,682
Where would you want to go?

748
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,124
Wherever you go.

749
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,924
( Music playing )
