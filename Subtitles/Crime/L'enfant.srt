00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,671
Bruno? Bruno open up!

2
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,238
What are you doing in my house?
- We've rented it from Bruno.

3
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,549
Where did he go?  -I don't know.

4
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,359
Open the door!

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,911
I want my charger!

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,477
Give me my charger!

7
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,278
Open it!

8
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,909
It's Sonia. I'm looking
for Bruno. I'll call back.

9
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,394
I ran out ofbattery.

10
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,638
Bruno?

11
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,675
It's Sonia. Do you know where he is?

12
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,995
Did he tell you anything?
For me and the baby.

13
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,149
Alright.

14
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,959
Bye.
- Thanks.

15
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,399
Bruno!

16
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,198
Did you come out?
- Yes.

17
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,635
Look at him, he looks like you.

18
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,119
I'm watching someone in the restaurant.

19
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,239
Look.

20
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,354
How do you call him?
- Jimmy, like we said.

21
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,714
Do you want to hold him?

22
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,919
I'll wake him up.

23
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,669
Hold his head.

24
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,354
Wait.

25
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,279
He's out. He's crossing the road.

26
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,518
Fast!

27
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,990
It doesn't matter, leave it. Go away.

28
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,360
Where do you sleep?
-In the asylum.

29
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,274
What about us?
-At the ladies one.

30
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,792
Do you have any money?
-No.

31
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,599
You spend them all?
-Yes.

32
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,916
Didn't you save anything for me?

33
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,757
Why? I always find money.

34
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,470
Nice, isn't it?

35
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,390
Did you buy it or you stole it?
-I couldn't steal it.

36
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,033
Come here.

37
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,878
Come.
- They're waiting for us.

38
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,638
I want to make love.
- The house is rented.

39
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,550
I was waiting for you. I
thought you'd come to see me.

40
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,350
I was calling you.
- I changed the SIM card on my cell phone.

41
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,633
He was born Friday
night. I didn't hurt much.

42
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,236
Touch my belly.

43
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,757
Tomorrow we're going to the
town hall to acknowledge him.

44
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,150
We have to find him a second name.

45
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,071
Do you have any idea?
-No.

46
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,874
I'm happy.

47
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,634
Let's go.

48
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,309
Come on.

49
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,232
Only two wires were left.
- There wasn't any more time.

50
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,110
They almost got us.
- 1.300.

51
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,552
1.300. 130 x 2 = 260.

52
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,395
200.

53
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,719
200.

54
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,957
60.

55
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,588
60.

56
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,830
Is there any money?
-Maybe.

57
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,919
Try with this.

58
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,352
Can you give me the cd?
-What you want it for?

59
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,513
It's my sister's birthday.
I want it for her.

60
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,913
20 euros.

61
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,878
And my share?

62
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,639
4 euros.

63
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,193
Hold it.

64
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,313
It's his will. Get me a wire.

65
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,271
Found one.
- Give it to me.

66
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,751
We want to sleep.
- We're closed after 10.

67
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,755
We missed the bus.
- No exceptions.

68
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,634
We got a baby. Open the door.

69
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,918
You're going in.
- Can he stay here?

70
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,196
There's no other one.
- No.

71
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,318
You're leaving tomorrow at 9.
- Wait.

72
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,954
Jimmy too.

73
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,275
Hello?

74
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,029
I got some things.

75
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,558
I prefer now.

76
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,908
I'm coming.

77
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,558
400 euros.

78
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,953
500.

79
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,595
Is this your hat?
-Yes.

80
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,718
450.
- With the hat.

81
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,675
Okay.

82
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,110
Do you need anything?
-A SIM card for my cell phone.

83
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,399
I got in the car.
- I'm almost done. I'm winning.

84
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,238
Did your girl give birth?
-Noi.

85
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,195
Boy or girl?
- Boy.

86
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,038
Are you going to keep it?
- Of course.

87
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,070
Some people pay too
much for an adoption.

88
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,716
Don't throw it away.

89
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,955
Give it to me.

90
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,033
Bye.

91
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,154
Did the girl with the baby wake up?

92
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,957
Can you tell herto wait for Bruno?

93
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,234
Thank you.

94
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,194
How much you take forthe cabriolet?
- I'm going to give it tommorow.

95
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,593
Only fortoday.

96
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,189
100 forthe ring, 150 forthe
bracelet, 50 forthe earrings.

97
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,917
Minus 200 forthe cabriolet?

98
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,794
Too big.

99
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,639
Perfect.

100
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,598
Awful.
- He likes it, he doesn't cry.

101
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,068
Stupid!

102
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,635
Leave it!

103
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,554
Tomorrow we have to go to the town hall.

104
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,671
Why?
- To acknowledge him.

105
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,395
We have to find him a second name.

106
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,197
Your grandfathers name?
-Nicola?

107
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,559
Did I ever steal you?
- When are you gonna give us the money.

108
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,118
This Friday.
- How much did you sell 'em?

109
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,319
450 forthe camera and...

110
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,709

115
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,630
Bye.
- Do you have a light as well?

116
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,994
Might worth it.
- Bullshit.

117
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,036
It's 1000 euros per month.
- I don't want to.

118
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,148
It's gonna be fun.
- I'm not working for assholes.

119
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,278
Look, same with mine. Do you want it?

120
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,079
It's expensive.

121
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,478
We got 220 euros. Do you want it?

122
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,549

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,789
Write 'the father" and sign.

125
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,198
Sorry.

126
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,236
Only one counter is working.

127
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,673
We should come back tommorow.
- It's gonna be the same.

128
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,592
Why don't you take him for a walk?
- Okay.

129
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,314
If she starts crying, come back.
- Alright.

130
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,234
Boy or girl?
- Boy.

131
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,396
Thanks.

132
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,030
Do you have any change to spare?

133
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,311
Do you have any change to spare?

134
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,154
No, I wasn't here yesterday.

135
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,073
I'll have something on Friday.

136
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,476
It's Bruno. No, from a phone booth.

137
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,716
These people who want to
adopt, how much they pay?

138
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,150
Should I call them?

139
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,153
When?

140
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,793
No, right now.

141
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,759
Yes, both.

We're sure. We want it
to get done immediately.

146
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,073
No.

147
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,113
Nine days old. Boy.

148
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,509
Thanks.

149
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,679
I arrived.

150
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,514
Alright.

151
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,274

152
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,277
The people who's going to take him...

153
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,556

Do they have money?

154
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,355
Yes.

155
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,279

159
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,758
Alright.

Where is he?

166
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,229
They're going to give him for adoption.

167
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,989
Where is he?
- I sold him.

168
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,039
I'm going to tell the police,

169
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,079
We're going to make another.

170
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,836

She's gonna tell them.

00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,352
The hospital is gonna call the police.

176
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,115
They're gonna believe her, not me.

177
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,198
Its too late...

178
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,914
Yes, I'm sure.

179
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,591
Tell them to call me
as soon as possible.

180
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,119
No, I didn't spend them.

181
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,551
Sonia, do you hear me?

182
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,598
She changed her mind.

183
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,871
No phonecalls.
- I know.

184
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,354
One minute.

185
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,356
The nurse came in.

186
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,309
That's why she is in the hospital.

187
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,919
Now she changed her
mind. It's not my fault.

188
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,479
I'm leaving.

189
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,554
Are you going to be here when...

190
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,516
Are you going to be
here when she wake up?

191
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,032
Can you tell herthat Bruno
is going to get Jimmy?

192
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,915
Are you going to bring Bruno?
- Jimmy, the baby.

193
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,189
Tell her, i got it sorted.
- Alright.

194
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,514
I arrived.

195
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,399
Alright.

196
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,788
The money.

197
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,919
I got them.

198
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,792
It's too high. One
minute, I'm searching...

199
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,594
Alright.

200
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,712
Did you bring the baby?

201
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,916
One is missing.
- Impossible.

202
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,472
Yes it was in my pocket.
I didn't do it on purpose.

203
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,319
Your phone.

204
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,795
The card?
- The phone.

205
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,518
Did you bring the child?

206
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,992
When you hearthe car leaving, come out.

207
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,639
Alright.

208
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,395
Wait.

209
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,996
Be here tomorrow at 9.
- I don't know you.

210
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,272
You're going to pay forthe kid.
- I gave the money back.

211
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,073
We lost double.

212
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,591
You owe us. Tomorrow at 9, alright?

213
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,719
Alright.

214
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,595
I'm going at my girlfriend.
- In the waiting room.

215
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,472
In the waiting room.

216
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,709
Did she wake up?

217
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,112
I want to give it to her.
- They want to talk to you.

218
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,997
The motherfiled a lawsuit.
- Against who? Did she wake up?

219
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,792
Take the kid.

220
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,794
Please.

221
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,794
For revenge.
- Why?

222
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,959
It's not mine.

223
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,755
Aren't you the father?
- No.

224
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,909
Then why you accepted it?
- I don't know, no reason.

225
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,756
You told her you sold it.
- It's fine.

226
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,517
You didn't say it was stolen.
- It's the same.

227
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,674
When they rob you, you
don't take money. You did.

228
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,551
Did you show them to her?
-No.

229
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,468
She says you did.
- She is lying.

230
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,989
She wants me to go in prison
so she can get fucked freely.

231
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,629
Where was the kid
between 1 and 4 this noon?

232
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,948
At my mother's.

233
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,670
Where does she live?
-19 Zoncig Street.

234
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,749
It's very important.
- He says it's very important.

235
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,319
Tell herto give me her
number and i'll call her.

236
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,432
She doesn't want to talk to you.

237
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,597
Can you give me her number?
- No.

238
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,230
I want to speak to my mother.

239
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,436
I thought he wasn't here.
- What do you want?

240
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,395
I've got a kid. A boy.

241
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,710
What's his name.
- Jimmy.

242
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,193
Bring him this Saturday to see him.
- I need a favour.

243
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,910
I had a fight with his mother.

244
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,029
I told the cops that the
baby was with you today.

245
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,952
What did you do?
-Nothing.

246
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:12,075
I took the kid to some friends
and she called the police.

247
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,671
Why don't you say the truth?
- I don't want to get them involved.

248
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,395
Alright.

249
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,950
When was the baby here?
- This noon, 1 to 4.

250
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,111
Sonia?

251
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,232
Put him in the perambulator.

252
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,591
Put him in the perambulator.

253
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,279
Can you lend me your cell
phone? They stole mine.

254
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,988
Can you give it to me?

255
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,389
Can you lend me your cell phone?

256
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,315
What did I do to you? I
thought we could make another.

257
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,116
Get away! Take this too.

258
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,518
Out.

259
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,388
Fifty.

260
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,274
I took it 350. It's new.

261
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,436
I'm leaving.
- Did you speak with Antuane?

262
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,439
Fifty.

263
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,636
80?
- 50.

264
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,556
70?
- 50.

265
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,999
You're gonna sell it 250.
- 150 the most.

266
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,029
60,
- 80?

267
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,592
65.
- Alright.

268
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,919
And forthe coat?

269
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,749
One euro.
- Alright.

270
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,477
Two toasts and a beer.

271
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,272
Are they going to play for long?
- They're losing.

272
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,478
Can you change me 50 euros?

273
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,313
You didn't come.

274
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,992
I need them to eat!

275
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,153
You owe us 4.934 euros. 5.000 minus 66.

276
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,278
We're going to meet every
Sunday till you pay us back.

277
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,712
I can't do that.
- You're going to rob for us.

278
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,875
See you on Sunday.
- Alright?

279
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,388
Pick him up.

280
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,993
Alright?

281
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,835
Alright?
- Yes.

282
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,319
Sonia, open up.

283
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,919
I'm sorry.

284
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,273
Do you hear me?

285
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,589
Wait, Sonia!

286
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,630
Forgive me!
- Spare me!

287
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,510
I need you.
- Let me go.

288
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,675
I didn't want to harm you.

289
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,478
Don't leave me.
- Get up! Let me go!

290
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,677
You gave me to the cops, we're even.

291
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,518
Wait!

292
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,796
I have changed. You'll see!

293
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,554
Dont lock, i won't try to get in.

294
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,871
I love you.
- You're lying, as usual.

295
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,994
Do you have any money? I'm hungry.

296
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,677
Push them down the
door. I'll return them.

297
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,193
Do you hear?

298
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:54,036
Do you know Steve?
- The one with the earing?

299
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,959
He's inside.

300
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,788
Tell him Bruno is looking for him.

301
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,069
Where have you been?
- Do you have the motorbike?

302
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:40,558
Do you have our money?
- I'm working on something.

303
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:46,069
I'm coming.
- Come at the river at 2 o clock.

304
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,352
What do you give forthe motorbike?
- 10 euros.

305
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,958
What time is it?
- Past 25.

306
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,758
Did you fart?
- No.

307
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,911
Must be the school's food.

308
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,116
Come on! What's the big deal.

309
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,989
Thief! Catch him!

310
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,517
The guy is after us!

311
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,158
I found them.

312
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,039
And coins.

313
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,073
Did they see us?
- Yes they're coming.

314
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,909
Hold tight.

315
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,118
Push.

316
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,512
Forget the bike.

317
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,991
Leave it!
- The key!

318
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,953
They're coming.

319
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,673
What are we gonna do?

320
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,239
Fast!

321
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,519
It's cold.

322
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,837
It's frozen.
- Come here.

323
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,230
Hold this.

324
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,151
I can't stand it, I'm freezing.
- Don't speak.

325
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,839
They're here.

326
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,554
They left.

327
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,999
Let's go.

328
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,674
Hold on me.

329
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,356
Hold on me.

330
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,709
Get up.

331
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,397
Get up!

332
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,991
What's wrong?
- I can't move.

333
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,676
Give me your hand.

334
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,395
I can't stand it.

335
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,754
Your blood must get warm.

336
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,716
We got to go. They might return.

337
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,834
Do you feel better?
- A little.

338
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,349
Did you get warm?
- My foot, here.

339
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,276
Keep going. I'm gonna
bring the motorbike.

340
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,754
Wait!

341
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,038
You're going to leave with the money!
- I won't.

342
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,797
Damn it!

343
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,754
Did they bring someone named
Steve here, about an hour ago?

344
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,119
Steve Lambion, 14 years old.

345
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,710
Can I talk to him?
- Are you a relative?

346
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,072
I have to tell him something.
- Say it to me.

347
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:58,032
I have to see him.
- Wait, I have to ask.

348
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,718
Someone wants to talk to the young man.

349
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,791
With the interrogator's presence.
- Alright.

350
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,551
You can talk.

351
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,353
I brought the motorbike.
I parked it outside.

352
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,755
I did it.

353
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,791
Are you the leader?
- Yes.

354
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,313
Do you want a coffee?
-Yes.

355
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,432
Thanks. 356

356
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,593
How'sJimmy?
- He's fine.
