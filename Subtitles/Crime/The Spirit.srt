bottom of your shoe that won't let go.

Yeah, looks good.

because it really smarts.

and we're gonna kill him now.

Or sometime soon.

00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,044
He doesn't publish his address.

We're not going to look for him.

00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,855
If The Spirit drinks the blood...

466
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,442
...if he so much as realizes
what it could do to him...

467
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,070
...what it could turn him into,
then we're finished.

468
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,155
And because I said so.

Oh, we shall.

475
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,759
I commissioned you to find a certain
treasure for me, Mr. Donenfeld.

476
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,012
It was to mark
the climax of my career.

477
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,890
Its crown jewel.

478
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,685
The lost treasure of the Argonauts.

479
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,689
And it was even worth me coming back
to this horrid city...

480
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,109
...just to touch it.

481
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,610
To hold it.

482
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,862
To have it be mine.

483
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,991
The shiny thing
to end all shiny things.

484
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:24,037
And I paid you a fortune for it.

485
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:28,375
And it would've been worth
every nickel, but you screwed me.

486
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,336
So now we're gonna take
every last one of those nickels...

487
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,922
...and transfer them
into another bunch of accounts.

488
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,216
What on earth
are you talking about?

489
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,301
You're gonna be

tights and the tight little derrière.

- Why the devil are you doing this?
- You sold me out.

- I didn't have any choice.
- Imagine my surprise...

502
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,849
...when I show up at the drop point
and ran smack into The Octopus.

503
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,518
I mean, what are the odds of that?

Unless you sold
the Argos' treasure twice...

505
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,277
...making a perfect ass of yourself.

A perfect ass.

- He's The Octopus, he threatened my--
- Your family.
