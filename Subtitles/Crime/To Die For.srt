1
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,215
Here's what I found out.

2
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,957
That all of life is
a learning experience.

3
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:38,228
Everything is part of a big...

4
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:39,955
master plan.

5
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:44,148
But sometimes it's--
Well, it's hard to read.

6
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:46,868
It's like if you get
too close to the screen...

7
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:49,425
all you can see
is a bunch of little dots.

8
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:52,595
You don 't see the big picture
until you stand back.

9
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,639
But when you do...

10
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:56,786
everything comes into focus.

11
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:02,648
My name is Suzanne Maretto.

12
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:05,812
No, wait. I'm sorry.

13
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:08,729
Suzanne Maretto
is my married name.

14
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,484
My own name...

15
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:12,725
is Suzanne Stone.

16
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,582
That's my professional name.

17
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:23,063
It's not like I have any negative
feelings about the name Maretto.

18
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:27,129
Maretto is the name, after all...

19
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:28,688
of my husband...

20
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:31,408
who I loved...

21
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:32,889
very, very much.

22
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,073
Sorry.

23
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,553
It's also the name of his parents,
Joe and Angela Maretto...

24
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:45,303
and of his lovely and talented
sister, Janice Maretto...

25
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:49,361
who have been like
a second family to me...

26
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,824
and who I regard
as I do my own family...

27
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:55,185
particularly since
my recent tragedy.

28
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,082
I knew just through knowing
and being related to them.

29
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:04,411
They have given me what I think is
a very precious and valuable insight...

30
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:06,712
into the different kinds
of ethnic relationships...

31
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,642
that are part of the very things
that I've been trying to explore...

32
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:13,848
as a member
of the professional media.

33
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,617
First impressions in one word?
You really want to know?

34
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,930
Four letters, begins with C."

35
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:36,696
Larry, it's a girl.

36
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:39,862
You ain't never seen one of them?

37
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:43,003
"Cold. "

38
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:44,563
Cold. C-O-L-D.

39
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,567
Yeah.

40
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:51,125
What did you think of Suzanne
when you first met her?

41
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:54,068
I just didn't get
the Suzanne thing.

42
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:56,956
All the girls around town
thought Larry was really cute.

43
00:05:57,022 --> 00:06:00,153
I mean, Larry used to hang out
at the restaurant...

44
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:02,077
on the nights when my dad...

45
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,990
would let Larry
and his dopey rock band play there.

46
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:06,909
Just, you know?

47
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,505
Oh, Susie Q
I love you

48
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,752
I love the way you walk

49
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,365
I love the way you talk

50
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:39,477
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk

51
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:47,129
Laura Risley, I remember.

52
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,534
Peggy Holden.
She was kind of a slut.

53
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,415
He could've had anybody,
basically, is what I'm saying.

54
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,066
I don't know. Suzanne-- blonde.

55
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:56,794
I don't know.

56
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:07,199
Well, yeah, sure,
I could've said some things.

57
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:11,869
Well, to tell you the truth,
I did say some things.

58
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:13,464
He's my brother.

59
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:16,058
But in a very subtle way.

60
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:19,613
What do you think
of Angela Raguzzo?

61
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:21,372
She's all right.

62
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,133
- She's hot.
- Why?

63
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,529
She wants you to ask her out.

64
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:30,391
Look, don't try and fix me up
with people. It's embarrassing.

65
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,124
All right.

66
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:34,561
What do you think of Dana Defalco?

67
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:37,441
You want me to go out
with a girl whose father's in the mob?

68
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:39,416
- Who says he's in the mob?
- Everybody.

69
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,879
So? Don't you want
a little excitement?

70
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:45,948
- I got all the excitement I can take.
- With who? The ice maiden?

71
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:48,157
You don't know
what you're talking about.

72
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,233
- I don't?
- No.

73
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:53,055
Inform me.

74
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:55,033
Well, it's none of your business.

75
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:57,856
But Suzanne,
she looks, you know...

76
00:07:57,923 --> 00:07:59,778
very fragile and delicate, right?

77
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:04,153
But when we're--

78
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:08,057
I mean, when I'm--
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

79
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,986
Details are too graphic.

80
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:12,637
But let me just tell ya,
she's like--

81
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,195
She's like a volcano.

82
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:18,780
You mean people come from miles around
just to watch her explode?

83
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:20,957
- Is that it?
- Very funny.

84
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:22,882
Like Mount Saint Helens?

85
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:25,501
Man! When he says to me--

86
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,001
I'm gonna marry her.

87
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:30,305
Wait a minute. You what?

88
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,608
"You what?" I said.
And then he says--

89
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm tellin' ya, sis, she's it.

90
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:38,690
- She's the golden girl of my dreams.
- Oh, God.

91
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:42,659
And I did one of these...

92
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,604
which I regretted right away...

93
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:49,499
'cause he looked at me with
that kind of doggy look that guys get.

94
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:52,864
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding!

95
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:56,677
She can't even bowl.

96
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:58,366
Yes! Yes!

97
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,121
- Let me tell you something, all right?
- Yeah.

98
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:05,794
She's like--
She's like a delicate china doll.

99
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:09,506
You ever try kissing a doll?
You know, they don't kiss back.

100
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:13,086
She's like one of those
porcelain figurines that Mom collects.

101
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:16,454
She is so pure and delicate...

102
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:19,549
and innocent.

103
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:22,437
You just have to look at her,
and you wanna take care of her...

104
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:24,357
for the rest of your life.

105
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,614
Yeah, I can see that.

106
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:30,469
So--

107
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:34,081
Anyway, so when she, Suzanne,
says to me--

108
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:37,980
If you're actively seeking a career
in the professional ice skating field--

109
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:39,779
in the spotlight, so to speak--

110
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,880
I think you have to maximize
your positive features.

111
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,326
Sure.

112
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:47,206
What I'm saying is that
a qualified plastic surgeon...

113
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:51,046
could just snip away those little
beauty spots, or facial blemishes...

114
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:54,210
and you'd see how much better
you'd feel about yourself.

115
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:59,143
You know, commenting about
my face and stuff.

116
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,786
I knew where she was going.
Miss Fixer-Upper.

117
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:06,468
I believe that Mr. Gorbachev--
The man who ran Russia for so long?

118
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:09,733
I believe that he would still be
in power today if he'd done...

119
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:13,794
what many people suggested and had that
big purple thing taken off his forehead.

120
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,620
I firmly believe that.

121
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:18,503
Someday I hope to interview him,
and we'll discuss that...

122
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:21,471
along with other more pertinent
international things.

123
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:24,861
I'm tellin' you, sis,
she's gonna be the next Barbara Walters.

124
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:26,311
Is that right?

125
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,126
Well, Barbara does have
many admirable qualities--

126
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,048
a wide knowledge
of current events...

127
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:33,121
and a deep sympathy
for people's inner feelings...

128
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:36,772
which is a trait so many people have
who are of the Jewish persuasion.

129
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,564
Isn't she somethin' else?

130
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,445
So, yeah, that was it.

131
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,619
I mean, a done deal, finito.

132
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:46,307
He was a goner.

133
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:49,925
The point is that, for instance...

134
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:52,579
Connie Chung,
who is married, I believe...

135
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,822
to Maury Povich,
the well-known interviewer...

136
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,436
doesn't say, "Hello, this is
Connie Povich with the news."

137
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:01,125
I don't think she would be
embarrassed by it...

138
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,260
because she's already pretty ethnic
when you think about it.

139
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,185
Or, to take another example...

140
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,065
someone who doesn't appear to have
an ethnic bone in her body--

141
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,138
Jane Pauley...

142
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:12,901
who I strongly relate to...

143
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,320
because, you know,
we have similar physical traits.

144
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:19,112
Although, I thankfully don't have
to struggle with the weight problem...

145
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,705
like she does.

146
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:24,170
And she also,
to the best of my knowledge...

147
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:27,104
has never identified herself,
audience-wise...

148
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:28,968
as Jane Trudeau...

149
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:31,555
even though her husband,
Mr. Trudeau...

150
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:34,562
is a prominent cartoonist
of some kind...

151
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:37,865
and not, as so many people believe,
the ex-president of Canada.

152
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,786
So, what I'm saying is this:

153
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:44,873
There are some people
who never know who they are...

154
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,007
or who they wanna be
until it's too late...

155
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:51,306
and that is a real tragedy
in my book...

156
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:56,260
because I always knew who I was
and who I wanted to be, always.

157
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:02,082
Who wants to be on TV?
There she is!

158
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:04,972
- Look at who's looking at herself.
- Just look at that.

159
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:06,760
Suzanne, lookie there.

160
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:08,716
Come here.
Look at the camera.

161
00:12:08,781 --> 00:12:10,723
- See?
- Look, what a darling.

162
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,172
Sweetheart.

163
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:15,052
Can't you get it focused
better than that?

164
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:17,928
And we're back...

165
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:20,648
with the families
of Suzanne and Larry Maretto.

166
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:22,823
Mr. Stone.

167
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:27,142
At first, I have to admit we--

168
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,996
we didn't think too much of it,
the relationship.

169
00:12:31,598 --> 00:12:34,980
Here was our daughter,
a college graduate.

170
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,443
Junior college, yes, but...

171
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:40,006
with good grades and a degree in--

172
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:42,891
Electronic journalism.

173
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,485
Exactly.

174
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:48,423
And here was this young man...

175
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:51,146
a good boy obviously...

176
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,833
but, still, a boy
whose education was...

177
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:56,906
limited to high school.

178
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,265
I remember saying, "Honey--"

179
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:03,369
Honey, I'm worried that you don't know
what you're getting into with this kid.

180
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,254
- Dad, I'm not a little girl anymore.
- I know that.

181
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,382
All I'm saying is that...

182
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,398
we come from
pretty different backgrounds.

183
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:14,821
"For all you know his family
could be mixed up with the mafia."

184
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:18,725
- I'm sorry, Joe.
- No problem, Earl.

185
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,655
- I was just being--
- I understand.

186
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:22,826
I understand. Please.

187
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:27,853
She just laughed at me.

188
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,015
- Don't worry.
- I have to worry.

189
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,706
That's what dads do.

190
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,113
If you ask me, I'd say Larry
appealed to a side of her...

191
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:46,316
that you wouldn't ordinarily know
was there.

192
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:49,451
It was a kind of a-- What?

193
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:51,048
A wild side.

194
00:13:53,777 --> 00:13:56,712
Not wild, but--

195
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,340
Wild.

196
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,930
I thought he would marry--
I don't know.

197
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:08,173
A nice lfalian girl.

198
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:12,205
But like the guy
in The Godfather says...

199
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:14,958
"This is America, okay?

200
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:17,262
The melting pot. "

201
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:21,105
Anyway, one day,
Larry comes over to me. He says--

202
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:24,302
I'm gonna tell you something, Pop.
She's going places.

203
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,599
She's got goals.
You know, she's studying stuff.

204
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,481
She's sending out resumes
all the time.

205
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:33,842
Did I show you what she gave me
for my birthday?

206
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,696
"You Can Be The 0ne."

207
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,324
The one what?

208
00:14:37,395 --> 00:14:40,079
Well, the one anything.
That's the point.

209
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,187
It's self-motivation.

210
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,812
It's from that guy on TV,
the inspirational millionaire...

211
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,738
with all the houses and yachts.

212
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,177
You know?

213
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:49,869
Sounds pretty serious.

214
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,722
Serious? Pop, I sold my drums.

215
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,722
- You sold your drums?
- Yep.

216
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,060
And he did.
He sold his drums...

217
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,100
And he did.
He sold his drums...

218
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:03,594
and he turned himself
right around...

219
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:05,043
just for her.

220
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:08,875
The veil Suzanne wore...

221
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:12,112
she had copied
from a picture in a magazine...

222
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,141
the exact same one
Maria Shriver wore at her wedding.

223
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:21,165
Larry, he was so proud, you know...

224
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:23,757
'cause Suzanne designed
the wedding rings...

225
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:25,618
all by herself.

226
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:28,107
You want me
to describe them for you?

227
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:30,865
They were round, and gold.

228
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:33,997
I mean, big fuckin' deal.

229
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,491
Come on, Suze, let's go!

230
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:39,468
I'll still never find
a guy like you, Dad.

231
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:43,600
What?

232
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:54,443
We got a postcard from Suzanne...

233
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:57,518
every single day
that they were on their honeymoon.

234
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,452
And it very much surprised us
that they went to Florida...

235
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:06,066
because Suzanne was never one
to lie around the beach.

236
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:09,451
But Larry was very much
into boatlng and fishing...

237
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:12,177
and I think she just wanted
to make him happY.

238
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:14,702
- That's a pretty lady you got there.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:18,801
We've been married for four days
and 18 hours.

240
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,424
I wouldn't let her
out of my sight for very long.

241
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:24,430
Well, she can't go in the sun.

242
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:27,406
It's not good to tan
when you're on TV.

243
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,295
What show is she on?
Have I ever seen her?

244
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,662
Not yet, but you will.

245
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:49,070
Hi, honey.

246
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,794
Did you miss me?

247
00:16:56,152 --> 00:16:58,040
Did you dream about me, baby?

248
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:13,776
It must've been a...

249
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:18,262
pretty successful honeymoon,
because when they came back they were--

250
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,719
- Radiant.
- Exactly. Radiant.

251
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:25,335
Larry took the money he was saving in
case he wanted to go back to college...

252
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:28,217
and put a down payment
on that condo at the Heights.

253
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:31,599
And he bought her
that pretty little Mustang.

254
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,658
- Hi. How are you?
- Come in!

255
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,421
All right. Come on.

256
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:42,037
So you thought Larry changed a lot
after he and Suzanne were married?

257
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:45,303
Totally! It was like suddenly
he went from Van Halen...

258
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,705
to Jerry Vale overnight.

259
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:49,233
She didn't have any--

260
00:17:49,307 --> 00:17:51,162
She thought
she had taste, but--

261
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,289
Barquettes with leek chiffonade.

262
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,402
This is the dish that they serve...

263
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:04,282
in Johnny Carson's
favorite restaurant in Hollywood.

264
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:07,577
Well, hey, if it's
good enough for Johnny--

265
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:16,497
Well, was that
some meal or what?

266
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:20,410
I say Julia Childs
better watch her back...

267
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:22,549
or she'll be looking
for another job.

268
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:26,964
Well, I won't be doing this
every night.

269
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:31,128
I'm planning on starting this exercise
class so I can get rid of a few pounds.

270
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:33,203
From where? Your feet?

271
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:36,888
- On TV the camera adds five pounds.
- Is that true?

272
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:40,120
I didn't know that.
Did you know that?

273
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:47,319
Talking about exercise,
I gotta go.

274
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:50,204
I got a rehearsal...

275
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:53,237
at some god-awful hour
all the way over in Norwalk.

276
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,441
- What are you rehearsing?
- Janice has a job in the lce Follies.

277
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,812
They're going on tour in September.

278
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:00,667
- That's fabulous.
- Thanks.

279
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:04,149
I'm just one of
the chorus now, but--

280
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:07,070
Actually, I do skate
this one medley.

281
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:11,411
It's kind of a, you know, salute
to great TV shows.

282
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:14,170
I skate the Peggy Lipton part
in the Mod Squad number.

283
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:16,765
Peggy Lipton?

284
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,001
Yeah.
I get to wear a blonde wig.

285
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:21,789
How exciting.

286
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:25,597
They're talking about like
maybe a TV special this year or so--

287
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,289
Listen. Hang on, everybody.

288
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,748
Because, well, we've got...

289
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:32,376
a pretty important announcement
ourselves to make...

290
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:35,229
and I think congratulations
are in order.

291
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:39,675
Oh, honey.

292
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:41,653
Wait, wait, wait!
Cut, cut, cut!

293
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:43,451
It's not that.

294
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,414
- You're not--
- No, I'm not pregnant, for God's sake.

295
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,547
- Suzy's got a job.
- What?

296
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:54,551
Over at WWEN, the TV station.

297
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:57,373
The first woman they ever hired.
Isn't that right?

298
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,066
That's right.

299
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:02,038
Yep, our Suze is on her way now...

300
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:05,146
and nothing is gonna stop her.

301
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:07,770
Oh, honey, I'm proud of you.

302
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:09,368
That's great.

303
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:13,440
We're proud of you.

304
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,912
That's great.

305
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:21,369
- How are the newlyweds?
- They're doing great.

306
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:23,776
- Thanks, Sal.
- Yeah, cute kids.

307
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:25,368
- Aren't they just?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,961
- Did you like the barquettes?
- The what?

309
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:30,106
With the leek chiffonade.
Was it okay?

310
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:32,033
We never did 'em before...

311
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,553
but she showed us this recipe
in a book, so--

312
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:36,252
No problem.

313
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,493
I never told anyone...

314
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,089
even Joe.

315
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:42,977
So she couldn't cook.
There are worse crimes...

316
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,073
as we all know.

317
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,180
You're not anybody in America
unless you're on TV.

318
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,217
On TV is where we learn
about who we really are...

319
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,778
because what's the point
of doing anything worthwhile...

320
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,410
if nobody's watching?

321
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:59,898
And if people are watching,
it makes you a better person.

322
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:03,870
Marry me.
Mary, say yes.

323
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:11,321
I thought she was like
a goddess of some kind.

324
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:15,421
Like Lady Di
before she dumped the prince...

325
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,826
and went nudist and everything.

326
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:21,055
Suzanne bought me this dress,
which I hope to fit someday.

327
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:27,487
Suzanne Maretto was
a beautiful human being...

328
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:30,971
with real dreams and aspirations.

329
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:50,621
Suzanne used to say
"Opportunity is always knocking...

330
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,082
but if you aren't listening,
its knuckles get sore...

331
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:54,848
and it moves to another house."

332
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:57,056
Something like that.

333
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,940
She said that even on her honeymoon
she had Larry take her...

334
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:02,907
to this hotel in Florida
where there was going to be...

335
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:06,210
this kind of convention
of all these big-shot TV people...

336
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:09,060
that she'd read about
in a magazine.

337
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,459
Which, of course,
she didn't tell Larry...

338
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:14,657
because she didn't want
to maybe hurt his feelings about...

339
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:18,021
her attending to her career
while they were bonding sexually...

340
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,777
so to speak.

341
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:26,366
So the German reporter
says to the Hungarian editor...

342
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:28,805
"Of course she's always smiling.

343
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:31,904
She gets "faxed"
at least ten times a day."

344
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:33,283
Boom.

345
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,936
Thank you.

346
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,894
I know that's a silly joke...

347
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:40,926
but it does illustrate
our central thesis today...

348
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:43,749
which is "Here and Now in the...

349
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:45,637
Fast-Moving Computer Age."

350
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:47,078
It's the--

351
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:52,871
In our fast-moving computer age...

352
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:55,106
it's the medium of television...

353
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:59,136
that joins together
our global community.

354
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:01,215
And it is the--

355
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:08,097
It is the television journalist
who serves as messenger...

356
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:11,070
bringing the world
into our homes...

357
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:14,592
and our homes into the world.

358
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:16,125
Thank you.

359
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,826
Thank you very much.

360
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:21,217
Thanks a lot.

361
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:30,656
- The point is, Miss--
- Stone.

362
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:36,768
That's a good name.

363
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:38,751
Now, that's a name
you can remember.

364
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:42,432
The point is, Suzanne...

365
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,636
if you want it bad enough
you'll get it...

366
00:23:45,705 --> 00:23:48,127
but you gotta really want it.

367
00:23:48,202 --> 00:23:52,709
You gotta be able to do things
that ordinary people wouldn't do.

368
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:56,804
You see what I'm saying?

369
00:23:56,874 --> 00:23:58,248
I think so.

370
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:01,222
How about another of those?

371
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,521
- I don't know about that.
- Sweetheart?

372
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:06,593
Give us another all around.

373
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:13,569
Anyway, when I was at the network...

374
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:17,505
there was this gal from
some ten-watt station in the Midwest...

375
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:19,815
where she did the weather.

376
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:21,890
The weather.

377
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:24,647
So she comes up to New York...

378
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:28,392
in her best Donna Karan
dress-for-success knockoff...

379
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:31,907
blonde hair all done up
in a French twist...

380
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:36,551
and an audition tape
in her imitation leather briefcase...

381
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:40,296
along with a letter of introduction
from her station manager.

382
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,054
And it says...

383
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:44,939
"Please give your
most serious consideration...

384
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:46,859
to the bearer of this letter--"

385
00:24:46,924 --> 00:24:48,680
Miss So-and-so.

386
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:51,879
"Who is of moderate intelligence...

387
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,461
who has some experience
in broadcasting...

388
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:57,256
and, more importantly...

389
00:24:57,325 --> 00:25:00,620
who can suck your cock
until your eyes pop out."

390
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:10,923
And you know who that gal is?

391
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:13,675
Who?

392
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:23,020
Is that true?

393
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:24,296
It's true.

394
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:26,755
And here comes the best part.

395
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:29,802
- Yes?
- This is the best part.

396
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,383
About ten years ago,
I'm at some TV conference somewhere...

397
00:25:33,454 --> 00:25:35,625
and I run into
that station manager...

398
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:38,344
and I congratulate him
on his letter-writing skills.

399
00:25:38,414 --> 00:25:43,171
And he doesn't know
what I'm talking about.

400
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:47,980
Why doesn't he?

401
00:25:49,102 --> 00:25:51,175
Because he didn't write
the letter.

402
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:58,343
Oh. Who did?

403
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:01,958
She did.
She wrote it herself.

404
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:08,493
Oh, I see.

405
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,501
It's good, isn't it?

406
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,447
- I watch your show all the time.
- Everybody does.

407
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:20,164
So...

408
00:26:21,488 --> 00:26:23,343
what do you think, Suzanne?

409
00:26:30,032 --> 00:26:32,204
What do I think about what?

410
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:33,647
Well--

411
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:54,960
Hi, honey.

412
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:56,618
Where were you?

413
00:26:57,969 --> 00:26:59,496
I couldn't sleep.

414
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,243
When I put out the sign
for a gal Friday...

415
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:05,648
I figured I'd be interviewing
a couple of high school dropouts...

416
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:08,943
who wouldn't mind going to the mall
and picking up doughnuts...

417
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,661
and emptying the ashtrays,
that kind of thing.

418
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,999
This is when we
first meet Gangbusters.

419
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,880
That's what George and I
called Suzanne.

420
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,040
Not to her face, of course.

421
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:42,703
Mr. Grant, I am the woman
you are looking for.

422
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:44,593
My name is
Suzanne Stone Maretto...

423
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:48,140
but I plan to use Suzanne Stone
as my professional name.

424
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:50,929
I'd like you to look over
my resume...

425
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:53,581
which details
both my educational background...

426
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:56,302
and my references
in the media field.

427
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,942
I can make you a solemn promise
that I will be...

428
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:02,986
dedicated and committed
to this job.

429
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,264
Hang on a second.

430
00:28:05,332 --> 00:28:08,300
We're only looking for someone
to answer the mail, run errands.

431
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:10,380
Minimum pay, no benefits.

432
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:12,308
Money is not my main concern.

433
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:15,504
I just want a chance
to contribute something.

434
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:18,868
I think you'll find I have
very valuable ideas about programming.

435
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:20,526
Whoa! No!

436
00:28:20,597 --> 00:28:23,826
You're not hearing what I'm saying.
Take a look around you.

437
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:27,538
I mean, Suzanne, we're talking
local cable station here.

438
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:30,420
I just want a chance
to get my foot in the door.

439
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:32,340
Everybody has to start somewhere.

440
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:34,991
Do you know where
Edward R. Murrow started?

441
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,872
No, I don't.

442
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:40,853
No. Well, neither do I offhand.

443
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:43,307
I don't think it was
at the top, do you?

444
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:46,574
I live only five minutes from here.

445
00:28:46,645 --> 00:28:48,500
I will be willing and eager...

446
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:51,948
to respond to any newsworthy
emergency you put in front of me.

447
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:57,902
Mr. Grant, this is a dream
I have had all my life.

448
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:00,363
I will do anything to get this job.

449
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,074
This is my associate George.

450
00:29:08,183 --> 00:29:10,670
Pleased to meet you, George.

451
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:13,426
Well, we'll think about it.

452
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,946
I believe that my assets--

453
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:19,186
I said we'll think about it!

454
00:29:19,255 --> 00:29:21,165
And we will.

455
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:23,312
Thank you.

456
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,464
I believe that
in our fast-moving computer age...

457
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:36,114
it is the medium of television that
joins together the global community...

458
00:29:36,184 --> 00:29:39,031
and it is the television journalist
who serves as messenger...

459
00:29:39,096 --> 00:29:42,958
bringing the world into our homes
and our homes into the world.

460
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:46,228
It has always been my dream
to become such a messenger.

461
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:48,435
I look to you, gentlemen, now...

462
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,544
to make that dream...

463
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:52,143
a reality.

464
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:01,966
Jesus Christ.

465
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,048
Gangbusters.

466
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:06,128
Fuckin' gangbusters.

467
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:34,229
- Come on back to bed.
- I gotta go to work.

468
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:35,891
- Ten minutes.
- I gotta go.

469
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:38,297
- Five minutes.
- I gotta put my face on.

470
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:42,323
- Put your face on me. Two minutes.
- Take your hand away.

471
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,713
Come, Walter.

472
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:58,225
The dog was a cute little thing,
wasn't it?

473
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:00,154
She was crazy about that dog.

474
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:01,561
It was darling.

475
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:18,994
Oh, hello!

476
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,492
She named it Walter...

477
00:31:29,564 --> 00:31:30,939
after Walter--

478
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:34,452
Is it "Cronkite"?
The guy who used to be on TV.

479
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,274
I think he was Dan Rather's
uncle or something.

480
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:41,170
It was like a hair ball puked up
by some demon from hell.

481
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:44,632
There wasn't much to do.

482
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:48,857
Most of the time she just sat
over there and worked on her file...

483
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:51,314
her idea file.

484
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:53,299
She had so many ideas.

485
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:58,906
This is the presentation on that idea
with me going to local movie theaters...

486
00:31:58,974 --> 00:32:01,941
talking to the people coming out
to see what they really think.

487
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:04,316
An actual...

488
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:06,902
vox populae, if you know the term.

489
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:11,582
Here's the memo on that children's show
with me as the hostess...

490
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:13,533
and the live, in-studio animals.

491
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,216
Look it over tonight.
Give me your thoughts in the morning.

492
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:21,043
A couple of pages outlining that concept
for interviewing everyday citizens...

493
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,355
like mailmen,
school crossing guards...

494
00:32:23,422 --> 00:32:27,449
to inform our citizenry on what kind of
valuable services are available to them.

495
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,961
After a few months,
she wore me down.

496
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:39,031
I let her do the evening weather report,
which she was fine at.

497
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:41,438
Although with the preparation
she put into it...

498
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,445
you'd think
she was covering D-Day.

499
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:43,615
Six, five...

500
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:45,557
Six, five...

501
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:48,667
four, three...

502
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:50,296
two, one.

503
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,534
You're on!

504
00:32:55,328 --> 00:32:58,907
Good evening
from the WWEN Weather Center.

505
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,502
Weather Center?

506
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:02,399
The heavy system
we were expecting...

507
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,399
moving down from the north
is not going to show up after all...

508
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:07,545
because the high pressure system...

509
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:10,682
is going to be moving
up to the north.

510
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:13,981
The temperature for tonight
will remain unseasonably cool...

511
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:16,634
with patches of fog in the morning
and probably--

512
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:19,356
Come on.
Let's have some quiet here.

513
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:21,978
The winds are at
seven to ten miles per hour.

514
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:23,576
Sunrise will be at 6:12.

515
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:26,137
That's about It for your
up-to-the-minute weather report.

516
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:28,543
This is your
WWEN weather person saying...

517
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:31,741
I'll be with You again tomorrow evening,
rain or shine.

518
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:50,394
I never really gave a rat's ass
about the weather...

519
00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:54,140
until I got to know Mrs. Maretto.

520
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,080
Now I take it very seriously.

521
00:33:58,146 --> 00:33:59,520
If it rains...

522
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:03,618
or there's lightning or thunder...

523
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:05,690
or if it snows...

524
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:07,519
I have to jack off.

525
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:11,291
Oh, right. Sorry.

526
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:56,484
Today's guest, Mrs. Maretto...

527
00:34:57,605 --> 00:35:02,046
is a representative
of our local television station, WWEN.

528
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:04,353
- On-air correspondent.
- I'm sorry?

529
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:07,520
Actually, I'm
an on-air correspondent.

530
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:09,597
Well, that's fine.

531
00:35:09,669 --> 00:35:13,183
Anyway, Mrs. Maretto has asked
to have a few words with you.

532
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:17,509
I know that while I'm gone
you will give her your best attention.

533
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,548
Here's my best attention.

534
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:23,328
Did you say something, Russell?

535
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:25,121
No, Mr. Finlaysson, I didn't.

536
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:28,029
I didn't!

537
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:37,252
Well, first of all,
I would like to thank you all...

538
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:41,094
for extending me the courtesy
of your time and attention.

539
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,533
I got something to extend.

540
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:47,970
And I would like to say
that I hope you'll all be as excited...

541
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:51,715
about the project I'm here
to propose to you as I am.

542
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,823
First of all, I want to ask...

543
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:57,278
have any of you ever been
on television before?

544
00:35:57,351 --> 00:35:59,358
Not counting home video,
of course.

545
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:02,399
No one?

546
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,152
I was!

547
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:10,239
- What's your name?
- Lydia Mertz.

548
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:13,890
And how did it happen
that you made this appearance?

549
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,415
It was down at Benson's Electronics.

550
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,968
They have this video camera
in the window...

551
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,356
and when you walk by
they take your picture.

552
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:27,140
Well, this may come
as a surprise...

553
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:30,950
but that is how some of our
most famous personalities started out--

554
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:33,951
just seeing what they
look like, accidentally.

555
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:36,643
- Is that true?
- Absolutely.

556
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:41,088
Now, I am producing
a television documentary...

557
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:43,201
about kids just like yourselves...

558
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:45,313
because it is teenagers like you...

559
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:48,517
who are the future of our nation.

560
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:51,487
And, after all, I used to be
a teenager myself once...

561
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,765
back in the Dark Ages.

562
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:59,749
I would like to find out
about your way of life--

563
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,982
how you feel
about your education...

564
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,733
how you feel
about things like peer pressure...

565
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:07,689
how you feel about drugs...

566
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:10,697
rap music.

567
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,551
Pussy?

568
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:17,481
Do we have to get permission slips
from our parents for this?

569
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:19,521
No, that wouldn't be necessary.

570
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:21,799
When'd your folks learn
to read and write?

571
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,689
Hey, read this, shitface.

572
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:28,678
All right.

573
00:37:31,851 --> 00:37:34,818
I am going to put this list
on your bulletin board.

574
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:37,794
And any of you
who think this project...

575
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:41,664
would be as meaningful
as I know it can be...

576
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,114
put their names on it.

577
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,663
I would also like to thank you all...

578
00:37:47,756 --> 00:37:49,643
for your interest.

579
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,819
- Everything settled then?
- Yes.

580
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:04,930
Well, then let's give
Mrs. Maretto our thanks...

581
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:06,793
and a round of applause.

582
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,004
Thank you.

583
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,619
Sign up.

584
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:44,712
I'd never really signed up
for anything before...

585
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:48,230
except an after-school
weight watchers program...

586
00:38:48,302 --> 00:38:51,783
which I was asked to leave anyway
'cause they said I wasn't motivated...

587
00:38:51,855 --> 00:38:55,630
and because I gained 11 pounds
in three weeks.

588
00:38:55,695 --> 00:38:57,222
But this was different...

589
00:38:57,295 --> 00:39:00,710
'cause it turned out to be
the most important thing I ever did.

590
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:10,606
Now, here's some advice,
Russell dear.

591
00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:14,282
That nice Mrs. Maretto
is married to a boy...

592
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,482
whose father is a pillar
of the ltalian-American community...

593
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:20,170
and if he knew
how you had insulted...

594
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,541
his only beloved daughter-in-law...

595
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:24,462
he would make one phone call...

596
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,983
and a man with a big knife would show up
in the middle of the night...

597
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:28,779
and turn you into a eunuch.

598
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:33,200
You know what a eunuch is?
Of course you don't.

599
00:39:33,264 --> 00:39:35,151
You can find it in the dictionary.

600
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:38,958
If you don't know how to spell it, you
can look it up under "nutless wonders."

601
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:43,758
So I'm thinking,
there must be some simple way...

602
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:46,574
for you to make it up
to Mrs. Maretto...

603
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,528
for your offensive behavior.

604
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:50,502
What do you think?

605
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:54,573
What is a eunuch?

606
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:12,561
I have to say
that the staff at WWEN...

607
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:15,496
I have to say
that the staff at WWEN...

608
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,505
responded with total enthusiasm
to my project...

609
00:40:18,578 --> 00:40:20,432
and gave me excellent support...

610
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:22,407
both editorially and technically...

611
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:24,816
because I think they could sense
almost immediately...

612
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:26,792
that I was
onto something important...

613
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:28,655
in a sociological sense.

614
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:32,105
She must've taped
God-knows-how-many hundreds of hours...

615
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:34,415
with these three dorky kids...

616
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:37,298
who, from what I've seen, would have
a major struggle on their hands...

617
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:40,178
just reciting the days of the week
in proper order.

618
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:41,999
Forget about social insights.

619
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:43,822
Here, I'll show you.

620
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:53,134
This is 'Teens Speak Out" project,
tape one, take one.

621
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:56,588
I'm Suzanne Stone and these are--

622
00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:02,957
Now, let's just saY something
in general about ourselves.

623
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:04,402
Like what?

624
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:06,672
What do you plan to do
with your future?

625
00:41:08,372 --> 00:41:10,641
I don't exactly have a plan.

626
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,359
Well, you must have
aspirations of some kind.

627
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:14,803
What?

628
00:41:14,868 --> 00:41:16,723
A dream, a life goal.

629
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,553
I can tell you
Lydia's big life goal.

630
00:41:20,628 --> 00:41:23,443
It's to fuck
the new kids on the block.

631
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:26,708
That's a dirty lie!

632
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:30,542
I don't want to hear language like that.
It is very offensive...

633
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,428
and it is unsuitable for broadcast
under FCC regulations.

634
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,020
- You got that?
- Yeah.

635
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,620
Anyways, it was Motley Crue.

636
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:38,067
All right, Lydia.

637
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:40,402
- Just for your information.
- What about you, James?

638
00:41:50,614 --> 00:41:52,469
I think you get the point.

639
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:55,217
It's not exactly
Mike Wallace, eat your heart out."

640
00:41:55,285 --> 00:41:58,581
But I have to say
I've never seen more persistence.

641
00:41:58,646 --> 00:42:00,719
I once said to her--

642
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:04,205
What about we call it a night?

643
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,492
Just need to get
this reel cleaned up.

644
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,934
An hour, maybe two.
You go ahead. I'll lock up.

645
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,486
Don't you have that nice husband
waiting at home for you?

646
00:42:14,646 --> 00:42:17,134
He knows how much
this means to me.

647
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:20,852
He works full-time at his dad's
restaurant, so he gets home real late.

648
00:42:20,919 --> 00:42:24,880
Well, Suzanne, I sure pity
the person who says no to you.

649
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:28,338
No one ever does.

650
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:34,742
Why're you tyin' her up again?

651
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,263
Why is she fied up again?

652
00:42:38,328 --> 00:42:40,183
Just leave her alone.

653
00:42:40,248 --> 00:42:41,622
Untie yourself.

654
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:43,543
Leave her alone.
If she runs away--

655
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:54,645
As Scripture says,
God is alive.

656
00:42:54,712 --> 00:42:55,988
Fucker.

657
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:57,911
That life, friends, is heaven.

658
00:42:57,977 --> 00:42:59,832
Heaven is waiting for you.

659
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,840
See, nobody ever
called me that before.

660
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:13,138
All anyone ever called me was...

661
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:15,314
Jimmy or Jimbo or...

662
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,294
other stuff.

663
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:20,468
My mom told me
that I was named Jimmy...

664
00:43:20,537 --> 00:43:23,352
after this old movie star
she liked...

665
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:25,522
named Jimmy Dean.

666
00:43:25,593 --> 00:43:27,120
But...

667
00:43:27,193 --> 00:43:31,122
well, when anyone ever asked me,
I always said I was named Jim...

668
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:34,357
after Jim Morrison of The Doors...

669
00:43:34,426 --> 00:43:36,149
'cause, you know...

670
00:43:36,218 --> 00:43:38,389
he had this great kind of life...

671
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:41,753
just traveling around
and writing his songs...

672
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:44,404
and having women beg him
to do it to them...

673
00:43:44,474 --> 00:43:46,001
even to take his...

674
00:43:47,195 --> 00:43:49,267
"organ" out onstage.

675
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,585
That kind of life
I thought I'd like to have.

676
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:05,111
I bet he jumps her
all the time, you know?

677
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:07,830
Like after dinner, just bang,
right on the kitchen table.

678
00:44:07,899 --> 00:44:09,426
Fuckin' during even.

679
00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:12,117
Yeah. Maybe both.

680
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,562
Those skinny bitches,
they can't get enough of it.

681
00:44:16,636 --> 00:44:19,931
They're always wanting it.
That's a medical fact.

682
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:23,825
It's because the nerves in their body
are all bunched up in their snatch.

683
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,787
They're all right up in there...

684
00:44:25,852 --> 00:44:27,762
so they're all whack.

685
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:29,494
I don't think that's true.

686
00:44:30,556 --> 00:44:32,149
What are you, a doctor?

687
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:34,967
She's a perfectly nice person.

688
00:44:35,037 --> 00:44:37,906
You think she's gonna make you
a big movie star?

689
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,242
Just to be on TV
will be something nice.

690
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:43,284
It'd be something different.

691
00:44:43,357 --> 00:44:45,844
I got something different
for you right here.

692
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,218
You're a disgusting pig.

693
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,660
Yeah.

694
00:44:57,181 --> 00:45:00,497
You know what we should do?
We should get some money out of it.

695
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,093
- What makes you think she's got any?
- You shittin' me?

696
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:05,238
Her husband, Mr. Fuckin' Big Cock...

697
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,830
owns a fuckin' guinea restaurant,
all right?

698
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:10,869
Look at the car she drives.
Look at her fuckin' fingernails.

699
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:13,429
Big, red, sculpted, glossy nails.

700
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:16,982
She got plenty of money.
That's rich bitch stuff.

701
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:18,330
Yeah, maybe.

702
00:45:18,398 --> 00:45:20,854
You think she's
some kind of hot shit.

703
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:25,882
- She just looks--
- What?

704
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,154
Clean.

705
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:39,063
Come on. They're ready.

706
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:42,747
Kids, stop it.

707
00:45:42,815 --> 00:45:45,662
- That's a real pretty outfit, honey.
- Thanks.

708
00:45:46,815 --> 00:45:49,663
- You want one of these?
- No, thanks.

709
00:45:49,728 --> 00:45:52,695
What about one of these?
You're goin' in the pool.

710
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,229
No, thanks.

711
00:45:57,215 --> 00:45:59,736
He sure is great with those kids.

712
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:02,808
He's gotta stop eating that junk.
He's getting a rubber tire around him.

713
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,269
He'll make
a wonderful father someday.

714
00:46:05,343 --> 00:46:07,962
He calls them love handles.
I call them flab.

715
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:10,585
- What about you?
- Me? You think I look fat?

716
00:46:10,656 --> 00:46:13,722
No! What about the idea of kids?

717
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,319
That's what I mean.

718
00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:18,841
Well, I love kids.
I absolutely love them, but...

719
00:46:18,913 --> 00:46:21,946
a woman in my field with a baby
has two strikes against her.

720
00:46:22,017 --> 00:46:23,992
- Say I'm in New York--
- New York?

721
00:46:24,065 --> 00:46:25,472
Well, for instance.

722
00:46:25,537 --> 00:46:28,123
And I'm suddenly called
on some foreign assignment...

723
00:46:28,193 --> 00:46:30,494
like a royal wedding
or a revolution in South America.

724
00:46:30,561 --> 00:46:33,463
You can't run from place to place
with your crew following...

725
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:36,320
and conduct serious interviews
with a big, fat stomach.

726
00:46:36,385 --> 00:46:39,614
Or say you've already had the baby,
and you've got this blubber...

727
00:46:39,681 --> 00:46:41,591
these boobs out to here.

728
00:46:42,753 --> 00:46:44,314
It's just so gross.

729
00:46:46,498 --> 00:46:47,872
Careful!

730
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,799
- Excuse me.
- Nice.

731
00:46:51,874 --> 00:46:53,849
You having a good time?

732
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:56,410
Well, I want to get out of the sun.

733
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:58,489
I have to go prepare my show.

734
00:46:58,562 --> 00:47:02,752
I sure would like to have
a couple of them. What do you think?

735
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:06,205
What do you think?

736
00:47:06,275 --> 00:47:09,591
I think if you wanted a baby-sitter
you should've married Mary Poppins.

737
00:47:15,651 --> 00:47:17,920
Hi, Ed. Wake up, George.

738
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:19,645
Let's hit it.

739
00:47:32,515 --> 00:47:33,922
Hi, everybody.

740
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:37,054
This is Suzanne Stone with your
late-nlght sign-off weather report...

741
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:39,458
from the WWEN Weather Center.

742
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:43,070
I don't think I need to tell you
that today was a hot one.

743
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,042
That old mercury
zoomed on up to 91.

744
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:48,418
That's a record-breaking temperature
for this day.

745
00:47:48,484 --> 00:47:50,818
Tomorrow promises to be
more of the same...

746
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:52,892
with relevant numbers
up in the 90's...

747
00:47:52,965 --> 00:47:54,492
humidity to match...

748
00:47:54,564 --> 00:47:57,434
and maybe just a hint
of a breeze or two.

749
00:47:57,509 --> 00:48:00,324
Won't be much help with this heat,
the kind of heat...

750
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:03,684
that makes me want to head for that
swimming hole with my friend James...

751
00:48:03,749 --> 00:48:05,756
strip off everything,
including my panties...

752
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:07,771
which you can see
right fhrough anyway...

753
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:10,179
and poke my soft, pink tongue
in his mouth...

754
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:12,580
and slide my hand way up
the inside of his leg...

755
00:48:12,645 --> 00:48:15,460
until he's so hot
that he rolls over on top of me...

756
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:18,307
and I'm yelling, "James,"
his name.

757
00:48:21,606 --> 00:48:23,461
What are you doing to me...

758
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,625
with your big, fat, hard--

759
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:31,965
Oh, Jesus.

760
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,743
Listen to me, Larry.

761
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,993
So she finishes
her little docudrama...

762
00:48:45,063 --> 00:48:46,819
whatever the fuck it is.

763
00:48:46,886 --> 00:48:50,847
She sends it off to someone in New York,
and while she's waiting for an answer...

764
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:53,253
you should, forgive the expression,
knock her up.

765
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:56,189
Knock her up and then-- Whoa!

766
00:48:57,511 --> 00:49:00,773
Los Angeles? What does Los Angeles
got to do with it?

767
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,108
A course in what?

768
00:49:03,175 --> 00:49:04,582
Advanced media?

769
00:49:04,647 --> 00:49:06,436
Advanced bullshit!

770
00:49:06,503 --> 00:49:09,154
Look, I'm sorry.
You're my brother.

771
00:49:10,568 --> 00:49:13,863
I know you love her
and want her to succeed...

772
00:49:13,927 --> 00:49:17,223
but sometimes, man,
you just gotta say no.

773
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,939
What do you mean, how?
N-O, that's how.

774
00:49:20,008 --> 00:49:22,561
Comes to the right of the key,
throws up a hook shot.

775
00:49:22,632 --> 00:49:24,094
It's good!

776
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:27,518
The score is again tied
here in the first half at the Palace.

777
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:29,283
With the ball--

778
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:34,751
Yeah?

779
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,681
What are you doin'?

780
00:49:39,753 --> 00:49:42,502
Just sitting here,
waiting for you.

781
00:49:44,169 --> 00:49:47,715
I asked you to please keep your feet
off the coffee table.

782
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:51,397
- We got to talk about some things.
- What kind of things?

783
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:54,308
I think you know.

784
00:49:57,962 --> 00:49:59,488
No, I don't.

785
00:50:00,586 --> 00:50:03,902
Can't this wait until tomorrow?
I'm really tired.

786
00:50:05,674 --> 00:50:07,648
What?

787
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:10,210
No, I don't think it can wait.

788
00:50:12,394 --> 00:50:15,623
Sit down.
We're gonna talk about this stuff.

789
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,126
I think we got this great future
ahead of us.

790
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:24,358
I just want to make sure we both
understand what the priorities are.

791
00:50:27,115 --> 00:50:30,759
I think Pop's gonna let me
take over managing the restaurant.

792
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:34,664
And I got a lot of exciting ideas...

793
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:37,382
like introducing
some new menu items...

794
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,785
bringing in live music
on the weekends...

795
00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:42,186
and maybe even one night a week...

796
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:44,739
open house for
local singers and comics...

797
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:47,627
which you, with your TV background,
could help me with.

798
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:50,310
You know,
maybe shooting the acts...

799
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:52,648
and then maybe selling the tapes...

800
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,433
which you could edit yourself
back to the performers.

801
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,039
I talked to my folks about it,
and they thought it'd be a great idea.

802
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:01,635
Really.

803
00:51:03,309 --> 00:51:07,138
And, believe me, I am not selling short
what you're doing now.

804
00:51:07,212 --> 00:51:10,474
I mean, the weather report stuff...

805
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,450
which you're really good at.

806
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:15,234
But let's face facts.

807
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:17,251
It's probably not gonna...

808
00:51:18,957 --> 00:51:22,306
Iead to any big network offers.

809
00:51:22,381 --> 00:51:24,236
Now, this way...

810
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:27,530
we could be working together
in both our respective fields...

811
00:51:27,597 --> 00:51:30,980
doing what a family
is supposed to be doing.

812
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:33,704
A family, that's what
I'm talking about.

813
00:51:37,837 --> 00:51:39,528
What do you think?

814
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:56,776
I'll think about it.

815
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:07,725
It's true that the road
my husband and I chose to travel on...

816
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,441
was paved with many speed bumps.

817
00:52:10,511 --> 00:52:14,254
Larry said he would never stand
in my way, whatever happened.

818
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,596
But the word failure"
is not part of my vocabulary.

819
00:52:18,671 --> 00:52:22,283
My commitment to my career
or my marriage, or whatever...

820
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:25,734
has always been 110 percent.

821
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:28,296
Regardless of how fast I was growing
in my vocation...

822
00:52:28,367 --> 00:52:30,473
I would never leave Larry behind.

823
00:52:30,544 --> 00:52:33,326
The word divorce"
was never mentioned.

824
00:52:54,865 --> 00:52:57,582
What do you think?
Like the color?

825
00:52:57,649 --> 00:52:59,886
- Yeah.
- It doesn't make me look fat?

826
00:52:59,953 --> 00:53:01,808
I think I'm gonna get it.

827
00:53:01,873 --> 00:53:04,393
Mr. Maretto is going to--

828
00:53:06,385 --> 00:53:08,752
Yeah, right.

829
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,574
Let me tell you something.

830
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:15,948
- No, you wouldn't understand.
- Maybe I would.

831
00:53:19,601 --> 00:53:22,023
Well, you grow up, you know.

832
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,749
You think it's all gonna be
like a fairy tale.

833
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:28,680
Like you're Sleeping Beauty
and along comes this Prince Charming.

834
00:53:28,754 --> 00:53:31,624
And he looks at you
and it's nighttime.

835
00:53:31,698 --> 00:53:34,448
And he smiles at you
and kisses you.

836
00:53:34,514 --> 00:53:36,369
Yeah, I know that story.

837
00:53:37,138 --> 00:53:38,447
And then...

838
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,075
you wake up...

839
00:53:40,147 --> 00:53:42,569
and it's daylight...

840
00:53:42,642 --> 00:53:44,497
and you look at him.

841
00:53:46,035 --> 00:53:48,784
When you work all day,
trying to perfect yourself...

842
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:51,338
and create something meaningful,
you expect support.

843
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:53,778
Does anyone ever say,
"Did you have a good shoot today?"

844
00:53:53,843 --> 00:53:55,665
Or "How's the editing going?"

845
00:53:56,595 --> 00:53:58,122
I guess not.

846
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:03,055
I mean, the point is...

847
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:07,467
Larry is a nice guy, you know...

848
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:10,354
but he just doesn't know
a thing about television.

849
00:54:11,891 --> 00:54:13,582
Let's get outta here.

850
00:54:15,604 --> 00:54:15,636
Mrs. Maretto bought me
lots of nice stuff...

851
00:54:15,636 --> 00:54:18,418
Mrs. Maretto bought me
lots of nice stuff...

852
00:54:18,484 --> 00:54:20,972
like this ankle bracelet,
for instance...

853
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:25,579
and a bottle
of real expensive perfume--

854
00:54:25,652 --> 00:54:27,179
a "scent" she called it--

855
00:54:27,252 --> 00:54:29,969
which I'm saving
for a special occasion.

856
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:33,332
No one ever really
bought me stuff before...

857
00:54:33,397 --> 00:54:36,463
except my mom's boyfriend Chester...

858
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:38,835
who got me for my birthday
when I was 12...

859
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:42,960
a bottle of something called
Garden of Eden body oil...

860
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,160
which he said would be good
for my skin...

861
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:49,579
and which he wanted
to show me how to use...

862
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:52,592
which I let him do.

863
00:54:52,661 --> 00:54:55,083
He did other things for a while.

864
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:59,762
When I was 13, I got this mild case of
T. B. and he wasn't interested anymore.

865
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,181
You just have to block that
out of your memory...

866
00:55:04,246 --> 00:55:06,831
like some scary TV movie
where you just change the channel...

867
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:09,008
and pretend like it never happened.

868
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,729
Before you know it, the whole thing
will be like a bad dream.

869
00:55:12,759 --> 00:55:16,337
Anyway, my mom keeps this gun
hidden in her closet...

870
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:19,308
'cause of all
the sex fiend killers around.

871
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:22,449
And one time, I told him
if he didn't leave me alone...

872
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,334
I'd get it out
and I'd shoot him.

873
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:30,998
I mean, he didn't give me
any more trouble or anything.

874
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:36,112
Now I guess I wish
I hadn't told her all that...

875
00:55:36,183 --> 00:55:39,315
'cause maybe it put
some ideas in her mind.

876
00:55:39,384 --> 00:55:40,845
I don't know.

877
00:55:40,919 --> 00:55:45,229
I just told her stuff I'd never told
anyone, because she was my friend.

878
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:47,409
She was my only real friend.

879
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,090
Where are you going?

880
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,647
I told you, hon.

881
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,208
Pop and I are going
to the trade show in Freeport.

882
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,931
- We're leaving from the restaurant.
- Yeah. Right.

883
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,651
- Look, are you going to be okay?
- Sure.

884
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,975
Will you think about
what we talked about?

885
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:13,233
I have been.

886
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:15,443
That's great, hon,
because I believe...

887
00:56:15,513 --> 00:56:17,935
I got something here
that's really gonna work.

888
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:20,659
You know who I want
with me by my side?

889
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:24,816
- Who?
- "Who"? My best girl, that's who!

890
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:26,580
My beautiful little lady.

891
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:33,359
I left a phone number on the fridge.
And don't forget to lock the garage.

892
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:34,644
Bye.

893
00:57:18,203 --> 00:57:20,058
You know what
I'm thinkin', Larry?

894
00:57:20,123 --> 00:57:23,190
Why don't we get some artificial
plants for the restaurant?

895
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,074
Good idea.

896
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,009
- Then we don't have to water them.
- Exactly.

897
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:39,063
Come on, Liddy.

898
00:57:40,765 --> 00:57:42,837
I can't do this,
Mrs. Maretto.

899
00:57:42,908 --> 00:57:44,469
Of course you can.

900
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:47,388
You just have to let your
natural sense of rhythm take over.

901
00:57:49,405 --> 00:57:51,260
I don't think I have
one of those.

902
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:54,107
- She really stinks at this.
- Here.

903
00:57:54,173 --> 00:57:56,758
Watch me.
Watch me.

904
00:57:56,829 --> 00:57:58,684
Watch my hips.

905
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,116
You can do that.

906
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:03,221
Can't you?

907
00:58:04,477 --> 00:58:06,714
- I can't do that.
- Of course you can !

908
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:10,426
You just have to move.
Move your body.

909
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:13,304
Come on.

910
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:19,956
Come on. Relax.

911
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,685
Relax!
You're like a stick.

912
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,401
- I can't do this.
- Move your hips.

913
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:29,813
No, I gotta sit down.
This is makin' me feel all funny.

914
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:34,910
Come on, James.

915
00:58:37,535 --> 00:58:39,160
Come on.

916
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:53,592
Come on, James.

917
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,907
I'm dancing.

918
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:04,663
- Would you do me an enormous favor?
- Sure. What?

919
00:59:04,736 --> 00:59:07,965
Walter hasn't been out
for hours.

920
00:59:08,031 --> 00:59:10,453
Would you take him
for a walk around the block?

921
00:59:13,472 --> 00:59:16,058
- Yeah. Sure.
- I'm gonna go upstairs.

922
00:59:17,088 --> 00:59:18,517
Take my sweater off.

923
00:59:18,592 --> 00:59:20,959
It's really hot in here.

924
00:59:25,505 --> 00:59:28,123
When you come back,
I'll fix us something to eat.

925
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:30,366
And, Liddy?

926
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:34,208
Don't let him come back until
he's done his business, okay?

927
00:59:34,273 --> 00:59:36,128
Like a good little boy.

928
00:59:56,898 --> 00:59:58,491
I'm back.

929
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,208
Hello?

930
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,407
I have to use the bathroom.

931
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:19,935
It was like I was
in one of those--

932
01:01:20,006 --> 01:01:24,894
Okay, you know those great movies where
everyone is comin' out of their graves?

933
01:01:24,965 --> 01:01:28,064
With like
half their faces missing...

934
01:01:28,134 --> 01:01:31,680
and their eyes hanging out
and their lips falling off?

935
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,124
You know those?

936
01:01:34,854 --> 01:01:36,742
And they're all
walking around...

937
01:01:37,574 --> 01:01:40,324
real slow like this.

938
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:43,489
They're all walking like this
and kind of grunting.

939
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,881
And they're all looking
for the same thing.

940
01:01:51,814 --> 01:01:54,149
For regular live people,
to eat their flesh...

941
01:01:54,215 --> 01:01:56,452
and drink their blood and all.

942
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,374
Smile. Smile.

943
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:08,031
And they can 't
help themselves...

944
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:10,470
'cause they're dead...

945
01:02:10,536 --> 01:02:13,285
and that's just what happens.

946
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:15,773
That's what I felt like.

947
01:02:17,127 --> 01:02:20,805
You gotta tell me
what's wrong, please.

948
01:02:20,872 --> 01:02:24,320
James, do you think about me
when we're not together?

949
01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:26,759
All I do is think about you.

950
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:31,969
When I'm not with you,
I'm not alive.

951
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,211
Mrs. Maretto...

952
01:02:35,144 --> 01:02:38,559
you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

953
01:02:38,632 --> 01:02:41,567
- I can't do this anymore.
- What?

954
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:45,765
I can't go home every night
and have him try to touch me.

955
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:49,542
And all the time
I'm just thinking about you.

956
01:02:49,609 --> 01:02:51,714
About us.

957
01:02:51,785 --> 01:02:56,225
And when I push him away,
he has this temper.

958
01:02:56,297 --> 01:02:57,672
What do you mean?

959
01:02:57,737 --> 01:03:00,225
Does he hurt you?

960
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:04,264
There were these women,
you know...

961
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:08,869
on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show
the other day...

962
01:03:08,938 --> 01:03:12,200
and they were all wearing disguises
so their husbands couldn't find them.

963
01:03:12,266 --> 01:03:15,779
They were living in shelters, and
I thought I could live in one of them.

964
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:19,462
If they let me bring Walter with me,
I could live in one of them.

965
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:23,142
Someplace in another state
where no one even knows who I am.

966
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:26,723
Look. Couldn't you
just get a divorce?

967
01:03:26,794 --> 01:03:30,624
- And then--
- But then he would get the condo.

968
01:03:30,698 --> 01:03:34,593
And he'd get the car.
And he'd take Walter from me!

969
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,968
He'd take Walter.

970
01:03:37,035 --> 01:03:40,865
I know you think
I'm just a kid, but...

971
01:03:40,939 --> 01:03:44,255
I could never do
anything bad to you...

972
01:03:44,331 --> 01:03:47,527
or ever hurt you.

973
01:03:47,596 --> 01:03:50,945
A guy that does that
to someone like you...

974
01:03:51,019 --> 01:03:53,256
doesn't deserve to live.

975
01:03:53,323 --> 01:03:56,073
That's the truth.
He doesn't deserve to live.

976
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,948
No. I suppose you're right.

977
01:04:01,068 --> 01:04:02,856
He doesn't.

978
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,613
Oh, fuck!
I love this song!

979
01:04:08,684 --> 01:04:11,172
Don't you love this song?

980
01:04:11,245 --> 01:04:12,619
I don't know.

981
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:55,593
Mrs. Maretto used to let me
drive around in her car...

982
01:04:55,662 --> 01:04:58,281
even though I didn't have
a learner's permit.

983
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:02,059
'Cause she said when she'd be living
in California and doing her TV shows...

984
01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:06,218
she'd make me her personal assistant,
and I'd have to drive her places...

985
01:05:06,286 --> 01:05:09,286
and help her answer
her personal fan mail.

986
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:13,896
I guess this is the
most exciting time of my life.

987
01:05:13,966 --> 01:05:16,836
It was like living
in a really great movie...

988
01:05:16,911 --> 01:05:20,588
except it was kind of X-rated on account
of all the sex stuff, you know.

989
01:05:29,071 --> 01:05:30,926
Hey. Don't stop.

990
01:05:30,991 --> 01:05:33,358
You didn't answer my question.

991
01:05:33,423 --> 01:05:35,311
What question was that?

992
01:05:35,376 --> 01:05:37,449
Did you talk to Russell?

993
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:39,910
Yeah, I did.

994
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:42,187
What did he say?

995
01:05:42,255 --> 01:05:44,078
He wants a thousand dollars.

996
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:48,237
- Is that all?
- And some CDs.

997
01:05:53,553 --> 01:05:57,481
- Did you get the gun?
- No, not yet.

998
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:00,488
- Why not?
- I don't know.

999
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,862
I guess I thought
you'd ask Lydia or--

1000
01:06:02,928 --> 01:06:06,758
I can't ask Liddy. You have to.
Don't you understand?

1001
01:06:08,113 --> 01:06:10,480
I guess so,
but I thought--

1002
01:06:10,545 --> 01:06:13,545
Do you want me to keep doing
what I was doing?

1003
01:06:13,617 --> 01:06:16,617
- Yeah, please.
- Okay.

1004
01:06:16,689 --> 01:06:20,105
Then you have to do
what you have to do.

1005
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,436
- So when will it happen?
- Please don't--

1006
01:06:31,506 --> 01:06:34,802
- I just want to know when.
- Let's just do this.

1007
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:38,990
I don't know.
Whenever. Jesus.

1008
01:06:41,107 --> 01:06:43,692
If you don't know,
I'll have to find somebody who does.

1009
01:06:43,762 --> 01:06:47,341
Aw, Mrs. Maretto,
you have to understand.

1010
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:49,832
No. I think I do understand.

1011
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:53,104
Obviously you're not the mature
individual that I thought you were.

1012
01:06:58,419 --> 01:07:01,485
Actually,
I just had a thought.

1013
01:07:01,555 --> 01:07:04,490
- Maybe a better way to go on the thing.
- What's that?

1014
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:07,472
- Russell.
- What about him?

1015
01:07:09,939 --> 01:07:13,584
Russell's enough of a man
to take charge of the situation.

1016
01:07:13,652 --> 01:07:16,619
- Well--
- He looks at me in a certain way.

1017
01:07:18,036 --> 01:07:20,851
I think he'd be very appreciative
of what I could do for him.

1018
01:07:23,412 --> 01:07:25,266
What do you think?

1019
01:07:28,276 --> 01:07:31,276
I think we could
probably do it next week.

1020
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:32,722
Is that soon enough?

1021
01:07:34,036 --> 01:07:35,891
Would you really
do that for me, James?

1022
01:07:36,596 --> 01:07:38,320
Anything.

1023
01:07:40,405 --> 01:07:43,055
And then we can be together.

1024
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,612
And you can sleep over.

1025
01:07:45,685 --> 01:07:48,620
And we could do
anything we wanna do.

1026
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:51,148
- Anything?
- Yeah.

1027
01:07:59,189 --> 01:08:00,716
Anything.

1028
01:08:04,726 --> 01:08:04,758
Got it?

1029
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:06,765
Got it?

1030
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:09,685
Stand back,
tell me if it's straight.

1031
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,986
Oh, it looks great.

1032
01:09:21,752 --> 01:09:23,662
Hey, Walter!

1033
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,142
Five.

1034
01:09:38,137 --> 01:09:40,025
Four.

1035
01:09:43,033 --> 01:09:46,383
Come on, boy.
Let's go for a walk.

1036
01:09:46,457 --> 01:09:47,505
Three.

1037
01:09:55,514 --> 01:09:56,146
Two.

1038
01:09:57,819 --> 01:09:58,418
One.

1039
01:10:01,499 --> 01:10:02,611
Hi, everybody.

1040
01:10:02,682 --> 01:10:05,104
- This is Suzanne Stone, live.
- What do you want?

1041
01:10:05,179 --> 01:10:06,673
Don't fuckin' move.

1042
01:10:06,747 --> 01:10:08,656
Just take whatever you want
and get out.

1043
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:10,619
Come on, Jimmy. Now!

1044
01:10:10,683 --> 01:10:12,374
Wait.

1045
01:10:12,443 --> 01:10:13,337
Just wait.

1046
01:10:15,483 --> 01:10:17,752
Take the watch.
It's a Rolex.

1047
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:20,372
I know it's a fucking Rolex.
Think it's the first time I've seen one?

1048
01:10:20,443 --> 01:10:24,120
Gimme your fuckin' chain.
Gimme your chain.

1049
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:31,698
As you've probably noticed,
it's been another beautiful evening...

1050
01:10:31,772 --> 01:10:33,594
with just a slight chill
in the air...

1051
01:10:33,659 --> 01:10:37,489
and those autumn temperatures
right about where they should be.

1052
01:10:37,564 --> 01:10:39,451
Now, Jim.
Do it.

1053
01:10:40,764 --> 01:10:42,706
- No, please.
- Give me your ring.

1054
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,788
- My ring?
- Give it to me.

1055
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:46,486
I can't give you my ring.

1056
01:10:46,556 --> 01:10:48,149
My wife will kill me.

1057
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:51,155
She'd kill you?
Suzanne would kill you?

1058
01:10:51,229 --> 01:10:52,636
You know my wife?

1059
01:10:54,845 --> 01:10:55,990
Jimmy, now.

1060
01:10:56,061 --> 01:10:58,265
Fuckin' now, asshole!
Do it!

1061
01:11:00,477 --> 01:11:01,972
God, forgive me.

1062
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,226
So, for the next few days
it should be...

1063
01:11:10,301 --> 01:11:12,505
just about perfect
for boat season weather.

1064
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:15,541
That's about it for tonight.
I'm Suzanne Stone saying--

1065
01:11:28,638 --> 01:11:32,435
And if you'll allow me,
just a personal note.

1066
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:36,439
A special greeting
to my husband Larry...

1067
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:38,899
on this, our first anniversary.

1068
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:41,561
Good night, honey.

1069
01:11:43,646 --> 01:11:44,694
Come on !

1070
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,407
Hello.

1071
01:12:27,392 --> 01:12:28,286
Hello.

1072
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:31,961
Anything?

1073
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:34,270
Looks like a little dirt.
Who knows?

1074
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:37,948
- And this.
- What?

1075
01:12:38,017 --> 01:12:39,544
Don't know.

1076
01:12:41,313 --> 01:12:44,161
Feels like pieces of shell.

1077
01:12:44,225 --> 01:12:46,713
- Janice Maretto?
- Yeah, that's me.

1078
01:12:46,786 --> 01:12:48,640
Telephone call at the desk.

1079
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,144
Hello.

1080
01:12:55,362 --> 01:12:56,888
What?

1081
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,377
Thank you.

1082
01:13:11,842 --> 01:13:13,468
Hey, wake up!

1083
01:13:13,538 --> 01:13:15,611
We're open right now!

1084
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,400
All Saturday night around the clock.

1085
01:13:19,394 --> 01:13:21,249
Anything upset him
at the restaurant?

1086
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,511
Some guy come in and drink too much,
or say something to him?

1087
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:29,052
Five-piece, all-wood dinettes
in Colonial, oak and white.

1088
01:13:29,123 --> 01:13:30,879
Your choice, 297.

1089
01:13:30,947 --> 01:13:35,071
Complete king bed set--
mattress, box, frame-- 297.

1090
01:13:35,139 --> 01:13:38,042
- That's Tom Peterson.
- And Gloria Stewart.

1091
01:13:38,116 --> 01:13:42,077
And that concludes
our broadcast day at WWEN.

1092
01:13:42,147 --> 01:13:44,897
Your communitY access station
serving Little Hope...

1093
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:47,102
and the greater
Hope County area.

1094
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:37,252
You don't have to talk to those people
if you don't want to.

1095
01:15:23,847 --> 01:15:26,214
That's what surprised me.

1096
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,629
That he didn't put up
much of a fight.

1097
01:15:29,704 --> 01:15:32,518
I mean, for a guy
with such a mean temper.

1098
01:15:34,632 --> 01:15:37,829
When I was standing
in the hall...

1099
01:15:37,896 --> 01:15:40,035
with the gun...

1100
01:15:40,104 --> 01:15:42,340
I was trying to keep
from being too nervous...

1101
01:15:42,408 --> 01:15:45,027
by thinking about
Mrs. Maretto...

1102
01:15:45,097 --> 01:15:48,577
and how we'd be together
for the rest of our lives.

1103
01:15:48,648 --> 01:15:50,274
Let us take leave
of our brother.

1104
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:54,720
Living in Callfornia,
Florida, somewhere...

1105
01:15:54,793 --> 01:15:59,103
Iying around on beaches
where everyone goes topless...

1106
01:15:59,177 --> 01:16:00,835
and working on her TV show.

1107
01:16:00,905 --> 01:16:03,905
When the love of Christ,
which conquers all things...

1108
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:06,465
destroys even death itself.

1109
01:16:25,322 --> 01:16:30,341
All by myself

1110
01:16:31,498 --> 01:16:36,736
Don't wanna be
all by myself

1111
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:39,778
Anymore

1112
01:16:50,443 --> 01:16:52,385
I just knew.

1113
01:16:52,459 --> 01:16:55,688
I don't know why I knew.
I just-- I just knew.

1114
01:16:55,755 --> 01:17:00,294
It was like a light just went off
in my head, and I knew she'd--

1115
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,809
I knew she just got rid of him.

1116
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:09,956
Just got in her way.

1117
01:17:13,452 --> 01:17:15,143
Anyway--

1118
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:22,020
Then I didn't see her again.
That was the last time I saw her.

1119
01:17:22,092 --> 01:17:23,783
Suzanne.

1120
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:25,740
I'm sorry.
Could we--

1121
01:17:25,805 --> 01:17:27,910
Could we stop for a second?

1122
01:17:37,773 --> 01:17:40,261
- What do you want, Liddy?
- Just to talk.

1123
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:44,199
I'm really busy right now.
What do you want to talk about?

1124
01:17:44,269 --> 01:17:47,335
- What we're gonna do!
- We?

1125
01:17:47,405 --> 01:17:49,260
You and me and Jimmy.

1126
01:17:49,325 --> 01:17:52,555
- I'm scared.
- There's nothing to be scared about.

1127
01:17:52,622 --> 01:17:56,484
You and I and Jimmy are gonna stay
miles away from each other.

1128
01:17:56,558 --> 01:17:57,932
Well, he's here.

1129
01:17:57,997 --> 01:18:00,616
Here?
Shit! Where?

1130
01:18:00,686 --> 01:18:02,595
Across the street.

1131
01:18:05,038 --> 01:18:07,405
Jesus Christ!
Get in here.

1132
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:09,161
Get in here quick!

1133
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:13,933
Now you listen to me.
You tell James to stay away, all right?

1134
01:18:13,999 --> 01:18:17,228
What is the matter with you people?
Don't you ever watch Mystery Theater?

1135
01:18:18,255 --> 01:18:22,347
He says that he needs to see you
and that he's dying of love.

1136
01:18:22,415 --> 01:18:23,975
Tell him to call a doctor.

1137
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:26,633
And Russell wants
his money and his CDs.

1138
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:29,932
Really? You tell Russell
if he doesn't keep his mouth shut...

1139
01:18:29,999 --> 01:18:33,577
he's gonna be playing his
goddamn CDs in the gas chamber!

1140
01:18:33,647 --> 01:18:35,502
What else?
What do you want?

1141
01:18:35,567 --> 01:18:39,528
Just to be like before,
like we were.

1142
01:18:39,599 --> 01:18:41,672
Lydia, we can't be like we were.

1143
01:18:41,744 --> 01:18:44,526
We have to forget
we ever knew each other.

1144
01:18:45,712 --> 01:18:47,654
Go on, get outta here.

1145
01:18:49,296 --> 01:18:51,947
What about the Tv show
in California and everything?

1146
01:18:52,016 --> 01:18:54,187
Jesus, Liddy.
Get real.

1147
01:18:55,376 --> 01:18:56,751
God!

1148
01:19:03,856 --> 01:19:06,507
- Did you tell her I love her?
- Yes, I did.

1149
01:19:06,576 --> 01:19:09,511
She said you were sick
and you needed to see a doctor.

1150
01:19:20,081 --> 01:19:21,510
Hello, Suzanne.

1151
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:25,167
How's it goin'?

1152
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:28,747
I'm real unhappy I haven't been able
to give you an exclusive on everything.

1153
01:19:28,817 --> 01:19:31,632
- Pardon?
- The competing news markets...

1154
01:19:31,698 --> 01:19:35,014
are clamoring for attention, and
I have to consider future possibilities.

1155
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:38,473
- Of course. I understand absolutely.
- Good.

1156
01:19:38,545 --> 01:19:40,334
I need to collect my tapes.

1157
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:43,436
With all the publicity,
I've decided to finish my documentary--

1158
01:19:43,506 --> 01:19:46,124
- There's gonna be a slight problem.
- Problem?

1159
01:19:46,194 --> 01:19:48,715
- The cops took 'em.
- What do you mean?

1160
01:19:48,787 --> 01:19:52,082
- They came and took 'em away.
- Why would they do that?

1161
01:19:52,146 --> 01:19:55,463
- They said it was standard procedure.
- But those tapes belong to me!

1162
01:19:55,538 --> 01:19:59,150
Technically speaking,
those tapes actually belong to us.

1163
01:19:59,218 --> 01:20:01,553
I mean, to the station,
until such time--

1164
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:06,191
I'll show you the section that peaked
the cops' interest, you might say.

1165
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:11,208
Today we're talking about
sexually transmitted diseases...

1166
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:13,651
and teenage attitudes
toward them.

1167
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:16,715
Would anyone like
to start it off?

1168
01:20:16,788 --> 01:20:18,576
Personally, I'm against them.

1169
01:20:21,203 --> 01:20:23,243
Let's see if we can be
more specific.

1170
01:20:23,315 --> 01:20:25,934
What do you think of
when I say the word "AIDS"?

1171
01:20:26,004 --> 01:20:27,891
- Queers.
- Perversion.

1172
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:29,298
The Hershey Highway.

1173
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,179
Settle down, children.

1174
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:36,107
What about you, Liddy? Supposing
you were in a sexual relationship?

1175
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:39,247
Would you expect that person
to wear a condom?

1176
01:20:39,317 --> 01:20:40,877
I don't know.

1177
01:20:42,389 --> 01:20:46,415
I guess it would depend on, you know,
what kind of person he was.

1178
01:20:46,485 --> 01:20:49,005
Yeah, a blind person.

1179
01:20:52,725 --> 01:20:56,653
How about you, James?
Are you personally concerned about AIDS?

1180
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:01,938
Well, in my present situation--

1181
01:21:02,006 --> 01:21:06,927
Well, in the relationship I got goin',
I don't worry about that type of thing.

1182
01:21:07,862 --> 01:21:09,836
She's not that kind of person.

1183
01:21:09,909 --> 01:21:12,976
She's very clean.

1184
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:26,928
That's the piece Geraldo used
with some minor editing.

1185
01:21:26,998 --> 01:21:30,097
It was on First Edition
and American Justice.

1186
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:33,996
We made a few bucks on this one,
and got a nice credit.

1187
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:36,307
...in the Holy Spirit,
I want you to bow down...

1188
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:38,546
Arms straight up.

1189
01:21:38,615 --> 01:21:41,517
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you for my life.

1190
01:21:41,591 --> 01:21:46,293
Think a llttle bit about Your llfe.
Think about what you can part with.

1191
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:49,458
A dollar? Ten dollars?
A hundred dollars?

1192
01:21:49,527 --> 01:21:52,244
How important is Jesus
in your life?

1193
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:40,341
As you can imagine...

1194
01:22:41,561 --> 01:22:44,244
I was shocked
beyond comprehension.

1195
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:49,235
I mean, to think that these
disadvantaged youngsters...

1196
01:22:49,306 --> 01:22:52,786
who I had taken under my wing
and spent my time with...

1197
01:22:52,858 --> 01:22:58,193
and who would only stand to ultimately
benefit from my media savvy...

1198
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:02,128
to think they might be responsible
for this heinous crime!

1199
01:23:03,322 --> 01:23:05,973
It simply boggles one
with disbelief.

1200
01:23:09,691 --> 01:23:13,335
Of course, I realized,
and I hope this doesn't sound callous...

1201
01:23:13,402 --> 01:23:16,915
that the upside to all this,
assuming justice prevailed...

1202
01:23:16,986 --> 01:23:20,849
is that I would have in my documentary
an extremely marketable commodity.

1203
01:23:20,923 --> 01:23:23,541
Something that even PBS
would take an interest in...

1204
01:23:23,611 --> 01:23:27,386
which would mean a smaller audience
but a much larger prestige factor.

1205
01:23:27,451 --> 01:23:30,517
- Want to tell us about it?
- I got nothin' to tell.

1206
01:23:30,587 --> 01:23:33,686
- Your friend Russell told us plenty.
- Like what?

1207
01:23:33,755 --> 01:23:36,854
He said your dick
was bigger than your brain.

1208
01:23:36,924 --> 01:23:39,575
Oh, yeah?
He really said that?

1209
01:23:39,644 --> 01:23:42,229
I don't think he meant it
as a compliment.

1210
01:23:42,299 --> 01:23:45,169
- Fuckin' amateurs.
- Who?

1211
01:23:45,244 --> 01:23:48,211
Listen, as career criminals...

1212
01:23:48,284 --> 01:23:50,968
you guys flunk out
of kindergarten.

1213
01:23:51,036 --> 01:23:53,240
Your prints are on the gun.

1214
01:23:53,309 --> 01:23:56,211
Your pal left a trail of clam shells
all over the murder scene.

1215
01:23:56,285 --> 01:23:58,652
You boys did everything
but leave a business card.

1216
01:23:58,716 --> 01:24:01,945
There's Larry Maretto's blood
all over those shoes you wore.

1217
01:24:02,012 --> 01:24:04,052
And pieces of Larry's brains.

1218
01:24:06,717 --> 01:24:10,033
He, he, he used to
beat her up all the time.

1219
01:24:10,109 --> 01:24:13,273
- He said he was gonna kill her.
- I'm sure he did.

1220
01:24:13,341 --> 01:24:16,822
We were going
to California 'cause...

1221
01:24:16,893 --> 01:24:20,407
she said I had real potential
in TV 'cause of my voice.

1222
01:24:20,478 --> 01:24:23,128
- Doing what with your voice?
- Sports.

1223
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:25,467
Like being a sports announcer.

1224
01:24:25,534 --> 01:24:27,738
When did you start bangin' her?

1225
01:24:27,806 --> 01:24:30,621
- It wasn't like that.
- What was it like?

1226
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,532
It was just--

1227
01:24:36,606 --> 01:24:38,330
We were--

1228
01:24:39,262 --> 01:24:40,953
You were what?

1229
01:24:41,022 --> 01:24:42,997
In love.

1230
01:24:48,575 --> 01:24:50,714
We were in love.

1231
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:56,084
How many times? How many times
did you do it, you and Mrs. Maretto?

1232
01:24:58,687 --> 01:25:01,338
I don't know.

1233
01:25:01,407 --> 01:25:03,676
- Lots, I guess.
- Where?

1234
01:25:03,744 --> 01:25:06,646
In her bed?
ln her and her dead husband's bed?

1235
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,298
Yeah, sometimes.

1236
01:25:10,367 --> 01:25:12,058
Where else?

1237
01:25:15,008 --> 01:25:16,415
In her car.

1238
01:25:17,568 --> 01:25:19,640
- In her car.
- Yeah.

1239
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,014
And once at school.

1240
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,950
Jesus Christ.
At school, huh?

1241
01:25:25,024 --> 01:25:27,806
Yeah. In the back of the gym.

1242
01:25:29,409 --> 01:25:34,264
And once late at night at the station
where she does her weather reports.

1243
01:25:35,521 --> 01:25:39,677
And twice at the motel
on Piedmont.

1244
01:25:39,745 --> 01:25:42,166
0h, and the back
of Russell's truck.

1245
01:25:43,489 --> 01:25:47,580
And the movie theater
on Hayworth.

1246
01:25:47,649 --> 01:25:50,235
Oh, a couple times
at her parents' house...

1247
01:25:50,305 --> 01:25:53,272
when they were away
on some vacation or something.

1248
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:55,776
And...

1249
01:25:57,409 --> 01:26:00,987
also in the field
behind the gas station.

1250
01:26:03,906 --> 01:26:07,354
Probably where you get
your doughnuts and coffee.

1251
01:26:07,426 --> 01:26:09,662
It's close.

1252
01:26:29,027 --> 01:26:30,620
Hi, Liddy.

1253
01:26:31,778 --> 01:26:34,778
Is it my imagination,
or is that diet working?

1254
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:37,185
You lost a few pounds in there?

1255
01:26:38,563 --> 01:26:42,687
I don't know. I haven't
been eating much lately.

1256
01:26:42,755 --> 01:26:45,657
What's this about
talking to the police?

1257
01:26:45,731 --> 01:26:49,855
I just figured that Russell
would tell them everything, so--

1258
01:26:49,923 --> 01:26:52,957
Look. No one's gonna believe
anything Russell or Jimmy say.

1259
01:26:53,028 --> 01:26:55,167
TheY're just a couple of punks.

1260
01:26:55,236 --> 01:26:58,170
They wouldn't be in this deep shit
if theY'd kept their mouths shut.

1261
01:26:58,243 --> 01:27:01,953
There's no evidence that we're involved.
I wasn't near the house.

1262
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:06,461
And if they did find out anything,
you know who'd be in trouble, don't you?

1263
01:27:06,532 --> 01:27:08,419
- You would!
- What do you mean?

1264
01:27:08,484 --> 01:27:11,834
If you hadn't gotten your mother's gun,
Larry would still be alive.

1265
01:27:11,908 --> 01:27:16,349
- But you asked me to.
- No, I didn't.

1266
01:27:16,421 --> 01:27:19,999
No. Jimmy did.
Don't you remember that?

1267
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:23,386
But you asked Jimmy,
and you told Russell that you'd pay.

1268
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,500
I don't think so.

1269
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:27,548
Now you listen to me.

1270
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:31,036
I never gave Russell any money.
Do you understand?

1271
01:27:31,109 --> 01:27:34,208
The way I remember, it was your plan
all along. You and Jimmy!

1272
01:27:34,277 --> 01:27:37,823
You had a fixation about me, and you
were getting a perverted kick out it...

1273
01:27:37,894 --> 01:27:41,025
like people with your
sexual problems tend to do.

1274
01:27:41,093 --> 01:27:45,022
Russell went along with you because
Russell is an evil fucking scumbag!

1275
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,614
Who, I'll bet, you were having
some kind of dirty sex with...

1276
01:27:47,686 --> 01:27:49,726
in spite of your
lesbian tendencies.

1277
01:27:49,798 --> 01:27:51,969
- Wait a minute!
- Wait for what?

1278
01:27:52,038 --> 01:27:54,656
I thought we were friends.

1279
01:27:59,014 --> 01:28:00,444
Okay, then.

1280
01:28:02,214 --> 01:28:04,516
Can you take some advice
from a friend?

1281
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:07,169
You keep your
fuckin' mouth shut.

1282
01:28:08,295 --> 01:28:11,197
It's their word against mine.
Who are they?

1283
01:28:11,271 --> 01:28:13,954
A bunch of 16-year-old losers
who grew up in trailers...

1284
01:28:14,023 --> 01:28:17,569
whose parents sit around drinking
and screwing their cousins.

1285
01:28:18,855 --> 01:28:21,605
I'm a professional person,
for Christ's sake.

1286
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:24,005
I come from a good home.

1287
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:26,406
Who do you think
a jury would believe?

1288
01:28:35,592 --> 01:28:38,723
Thank God we still have
legal procedures in this country.

1289
01:28:38,792 --> 01:28:41,891
The court has ruled this is
a clear case of police entrapment.

1290
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,375
The tapes were found to be
inadmissible evidence.

1291
01:28:49,384 --> 01:28:54,054
My client was granted bail in the amount
of $200,000, which we felt was steep...

1292
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,797
but at least she'll be able to assist us
in the preparation of her defense.

1293
01:29:02,281 --> 01:29:05,762
Do you have a statement?
You have something you'd like to say?

1294
01:29:06,793 --> 01:29:09,793
- Suzanne, please say something.
- I just want to say...

1295
01:29:12,169 --> 01:29:14,144
it's nice to live
in a country...

1296
01:29:14,217 --> 01:29:17,348
where life, liberty...

1297
01:29:18,602 --> 01:29:21,635
and all the rest of it
still stand for something.

1298
01:29:21,705 --> 01:29:23,560
- Thank you.
- What are you gonna do now?

1299
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:27,368
I'm gonna go home
and walk my dog.

1300
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:31,012
- How will you address the questions?
- Will you take the stand?

1301
01:29:31,082 --> 01:29:33,221
Did you get those kids
to kill your husband?

1302
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:36,549
I loved Larry Maretto...

1303
01:29:37,578 --> 01:29:40,196
with all my heart.

1304
01:29:40,906 --> 01:29:42,881
But the fact is...

1305
01:29:45,354 --> 01:29:49,032
my husband had
a serious cocaine problem.

1306
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:51,657
There.

1307
01:29:51,723 --> 01:29:54,821
I've said it.
I've finally said it.

1308
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:57,608
I believe that while
I was making my documentary...

1309
01:29:57,675 --> 01:30:00,522
"Teens Speak Out"...

1310
01:30:00,587 --> 01:30:04,843
James and Russell became acquainted
with my husband without me knowing...

1311
01:30:04,907 --> 01:30:07,362
and got him addicted to drugs...

1312
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,891
and became his main supplier.

1313
01:30:09,963 --> 01:30:14,852
And when he tried to break free of them
or maybe when he told them...

1314
01:30:14,924 --> 01:30:17,771
he was thinking of turning them in
to the law...

1315
01:30:20,652 --> 01:30:22,027
they killed him.

1316
01:30:23,372 --> 01:30:26,471
I had no intention
of revealing thls dark side...

1317
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:29,442
of my late husband's character...

1318
01:30:29,516 --> 01:30:33,161
because I wanted to spare
his parents the pain.

1319
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,839
But I just don 't have
a choice any more.

1320
01:30:36,909 --> 01:30:39,243
I have to defend myself
with the truth.

1321
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:43,404
There were times when--

1322
01:30:56,366 --> 01:31:00,970
And I know someday
when my fight is over...

1323
01:31:01,037 --> 01:31:03,754
I will be joining my husband...

1324
01:31:03,822 --> 01:31:07,946
in the heaven that
he so fervently believed in.

1325
01:31:08,014 --> 01:31:09,705
And that was the last time we--

1326
01:31:09,774 --> 01:31:13,221
- The last time we saw her.
- And that--

1327
01:31:13,294 --> 01:31:16,328
That pretty well
brings us up to date.

1328
01:31:16,398 --> 01:31:20,108
Until your phone call, which I
must say wasn't entirely unexpected...

1329
01:31:20,175 --> 01:31:23,852
since in the last few days a number
of interesting offers for my story...

1330
01:31:23,919 --> 01:31:26,188
have been literally pouring in
from the networks...

1331
01:31:26,254 --> 01:31:28,393
and some major movie studios.

1332
01:31:29,423 --> 01:31:32,904
I totally understand why we'll be
keeping this meeting confidential...

1333
01:31:32,975 --> 01:31:37,034
until such time as we may come
to a mutually beneficial agreement.

1334
01:31:37,104 --> 01:31:38,958
And I have to admit...

1335
01:31:39,888 --> 01:31:41,993
that I really do enjoy...

1336
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:46,503
this spy story aspect of our first
rendezvous, if I may call it that.

1337
01:31:46,575 --> 01:31:49,063
Because I think that being
a good investigative reporter...

1338
01:31:49,135 --> 01:31:52,550
is very much like being
a kind of secret agent.

1339
01:31:53,583 --> 01:31:55,438
I hope you enjoy
viewing this document...

1340
01:31:55,503 --> 01:31:57,870
which I believe could serve
as the first draft...

1341
01:31:57,936 --> 01:32:01,831
that you Hollywood people
are so richly rewarded for.

1342
01:32:01,904 --> 01:32:05,352
Well, I guess that's a wrap.

1343
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:26,896
Come on, Walter.

1344
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:56,776
- Suzanne?
- Yes.

1345
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:59,468
Finally.
The famous Suzanne Maretto.

1346
01:33:00,403 --> 01:33:02,126
How nice to meet you.

1347
01:33:04,915 --> 01:33:06,857
Did you come all the way
from Hollywood?

1348
01:33:06,931 --> 01:33:09,419
I came a long distance
to see you.

1349
01:33:10,579 --> 01:33:12,140
Who's this?

1350
01:33:14,067 --> 01:33:15,442
This is Walter.

1351
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:17,678
Walter.
Hi, Walter.

1352
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:23,595
I don't know why,
but I thought that you'd be older...

1353
01:33:23,668 --> 01:33:26,930
running a big studio
and everything.

1354
01:33:26,996 --> 01:33:28,370
I am older.

1355
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:34,158
Come on out.
I want to show you something.

1356
01:33:37,396 --> 01:33:39,436
I brought my tape.

1357
01:33:39,508 --> 01:33:42,094
Let's go.
Let's go for a walk.

1358
01:33:47,573 --> 01:33:51,086
Oh, dear.
Where are we going?

1359
01:33:51,157 --> 01:33:53,099
To show you.

1360
01:33:53,173 --> 01:33:54,635
What?

1361
01:33:57,653 --> 01:34:01,330
It has to do with your story.
It is so funny.

1362
01:34:01,397 --> 01:34:03,732
I don't see why we have to go.

1363
01:34:31,479 --> 01:34:34,032
- This is for you.
- Thank you very much.

1364
01:34:34,103 --> 01:34:36,143
It sure looks good.
Thanks, Mrs. Maretto.

1365
01:34:38,326 --> 01:34:40,214
Maretto's.

1366
01:34:48,951 --> 01:34:50,806
I understand.

1367
01:34:52,248 --> 01:34:53,774
Thank you.

1368
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:28,018
I'll be here...

1369
01:35:28,088 --> 01:35:29,812
every day for life.

1370
01:35:29,881 --> 01:35:29,913
Plus thirty years,
if I live that long.

1371
01:35:29,913 --> 01:35:33,971
Plus thirty years,
if I live that long.

1372
01:35:38,073 --> 01:35:42,132
Russell copped a plea
and got only 16 years.

1373
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:44,209
I miss him.

1374
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:46,224
He was my friend.

1375
01:35:46,297 --> 01:35:48,152
And Lydia too.
She was okay.

1376
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:51,311
Mostly Mrs. Maretto.

1377
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:55,219
And the weird thing is...

1378
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:59,992
now it's hard for me to even
remember what she looked like.

1379
01:36:00,058 --> 01:36:01,433
You know?

1380
01:36:02,426 --> 01:36:05,361
Except when I dream about her...

1381
01:36:05,434 --> 01:36:07,289
which I do every night.

1382
01:36:08,922 --> 01:36:11,792
I dream I'm at
a baseball game...

1383
01:36:11,867 --> 01:36:15,641
and I'm way up
in the broadcasting booth.

1384
01:36:15,707 --> 01:36:17,878
And I'm callin' all the plays.

1385
01:36:19,866 --> 01:36:22,616
And she's sittin'
right next to me...

1386
01:36:22,683 --> 01:36:26,196
with her hand on my leg,
feelin' me up.

1387
01:36:28,987 --> 01:36:32,370
I can hardly wait
to get to sleep at night.

1388
01:36:32,444 --> 01:36:36,055
Suzanne used to say that you're
not really anybody in America...

1389
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:38,425
unless you're on Tv.

1390
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:40,979
'Cause what's the point
of doing anything worth while...

1391
01:36:41,051 --> 01:36:44,564
if there's nobody watching?

1392
01:36:44,635 --> 01:36:49,305
So when people are watching,
it makes you a better person.

1393
01:36:49,372 --> 01:36:52,689
So if everybody was on TV
all the time...

1394
01:36:52,764 --> 01:36:55,415
everybody would be
better people.

1395
01:36:55,485 --> 01:36:58,780
But if everybody was on TV
all the time...

1396
01:36:58,844 --> 01:37:01,266
there wouldn't be
anybody left to watch.

1397
01:37:01,341 --> 01:37:03,196
That's where I get confused.

1398
01:37:03,261 --> 01:37:06,261
Anyhow, they're flying me
to go on Oprah next weekend.

1399
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:08,951
I hope she's gonna give me
some diet tips.

1400
01:37:09,021 --> 01:37:11,476
And Phil Donahue called too.

1401
01:37:11,549 --> 01:37:13,938
But to tell you the truth,
I'm kinda nervous about that one...

1402
01:37:14,013 --> 01:37:17,275
'cause I honestly can't follow
what he's sayin' most of the time.

1403
01:37:17,341 --> 01:37:21,083
There's some others too
that I can't remember off hand.

1404
01:37:22,077 --> 01:37:23,932
But it's really something
when you think that...

1405
01:37:23,997 --> 01:37:25,907
I'm the one
who's gonna be famous.

1406
01:37:25,981 --> 01:37:28,829
Suzanne would die if she knew.

1407
01:37:31,837 --> 01:37:33,692
End sticks.
