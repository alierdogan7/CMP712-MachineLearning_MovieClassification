00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,279
Previously On 24

6
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:13,889
You're not my son.

7
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:14,806
Why?

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,236
Because I don't want to
kill innocent people?

9
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:18,293
Because you're weak

10
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:20,407
and you stand for nothing!

11
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:22,106
Is there a problem, Navi?

12
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:25,165
Government agents have arrested Dina
and surrounded the building that I'm in.

13
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,314
How much more time do you need to melt
down the remaining nuclear power plants?

14
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:29,752
One hour, maybe two.

15
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,831
I don't want to have
to kill you, but I will.

16
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:33,522
I have a suspect in custody.

17
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:34,343
I need assistance.

18
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:43,852
I need you to take Dina Araz and her son
back to CTU and head up the interrogation.

19
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:44,990
Wait a second, Jack.

20
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,655
They're not going to let me set
foot in CTU, even if I wanted to.

21
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:49,029
If I press hard enough

22
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,812
I can get you reinstated, but I need
to know now: Is that what you want?

23
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,227
Ms. Driscoll, I'm sure you're
aware of my history here.

24
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:54,952
Not an issue.

25
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:57,342
Jack Bauer and secretary
Heller both vouch for you.

26
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:58,187
That's enough for me.

27
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:00,559
Did Powell worked directly
for the terrorists?

28
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,380
I told you, I don't know.

29
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:05,777
I need names, people who
can get us to the override.

30
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:07,703
This place may not be as empty as it seems.

31
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:09,547
What, you think this is some kind of trap?

32
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:11,097
Yes.
I do.

33
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:12,417
I didn't give him anything.

34
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:12,852
I...

35
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:17,001
What does CTU know
about the override?

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,234
Audrey, it's me.

37
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:25,193
Hey, did you find anything at the address?

38
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:29,184
Yeah, the company that owns the building,
it's called galaxy financial services.

39
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,004
Have you ever heard of them?

40
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:30,881
No, should I have?

41
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,381
Your husband's the chief financial officer.

42
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,389
What are you doing here?

43
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:35,474
What's really going on?

44
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,524
Are you spying on me?

45
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:38,353
Are you doing something worth spying on?

46
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,179
What is that supposed to mean?!

47
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:41,961
Take your hands off of her!

48
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,443
You set me up!

49
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,313
Put your hands on your head now!

50
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,086
What do you want?

51
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:50,533
I want some answers.

52
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:57,040
The following takes place
between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.

53
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,690
I think it would be better if you left
the room while I question your husband.

54
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,135
You can wait just outside
with the backup team.

55
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:17,206
What are you going to do to him?

56
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:18,852
Whatever I have to.

57
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:22,629
I'm staying.

58
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,479
Fine.

59
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:03,231
Look at me, Paul.

60
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:05,582
Look at me!

61
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,319
I've got nothing to say to you.

62
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,044
This is what you need to know, Paul.

63
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,690
There are five nuclear power
plants ready to melt down.

64
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,673
All I care about right now is
making sure that that doesn't happen.

65
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:17,101
Your name is on a lease
in a building in chatsworth

66
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,500
that was used by the terrorists
to plan today's attack.

67
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:21,256
That makes you a prime suspect.

68
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:22,371
I'm going to treat you like one.

69
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:23,183
Do you understand that?

70
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,061
My name is on at least 50 different leases.

71
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:28,403
I own ten different corporations.

72
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,689
I don't know anything about
some building in chatsworth.

73
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:31,616
I don't believe you.

74
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:34,818
The lease of that building was notarized.

75
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:36,373
There's documentation of your id.

76
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,129
Ctu verified your signature.

77
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,800
Paul, you need to start talking to me now.

78
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:44,374
I've got nothing to say to you.

79
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:58,467
Jack.

80
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,977
I don't think that Paul would
be a traitor to this country.

81
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,841
Right now Paul is a prime suspect,

82
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:08,046
and he's not cooperating with me and I
don't have time to do this any other way.

83
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,335
I need to know for sure.

84
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:13,452
Paul...

85
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:17,869
this is the last chance you've got to
talk to me before I have to hurt you.

86
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,647
Tell me about 24878 alvert
street in chatsworth.

87
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:23,611
Why's your name on the lease?

88
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:24,256
Jack, please.

89
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,568
Audrey, don't interfere!

90
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,929
If you need to step
outside of this room, do it.

91
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,097
Why is your name on the lease?

92
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:41,504
You're bluffing.

93
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:51,546
I need that information,
Paul, I need it now.

94
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:55,979
Come on, Paul, just tell me.

95
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,313
What's your connection to the terrorists?

96
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,862
Jack?

97
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,682
Please, don'T.

98
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,721
All right, all right, all right.

99
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,732
I-I-I don't know the specific
building you're talking about.

100
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,217
I can find out.

101
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:25,859
How?!

102
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:28,547
My corporate records
are stored on my laptop.

103
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:32,092
If that address is under
my name then it'll come up.

104
00:05:32,684 --> 00:05:34,389
Maybe there's someone else
involved I don't know about.

105
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,103
What's your user id log-in number?

106
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,056
It'll be much quicker if I just do it.

107
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:41,789
Please.

108
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:59,693
You want me to believe that you're
not involved with this, Paul?

109
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,874
You better show me who is.

110
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:28,193
I'm sorry I had to call you
here, Marwan, but I had no choice.

111
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:32,851
Ctu is trying to disable the
override, using a drinfeld module.

112
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:35,592
They've already shut down over 90 reactors.

113
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:37,705
We always knew they'd stop some of them.

114
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:41,272
The important thing is that one
of the reactors has melted down.

115
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,423
As long as the override has control of the
other five, I can do the rest from here.

116
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:47,829
Everything is ready for you upstairs.

117
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,204
Will anyone in that office be suspicious?

118
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,121
I've reported a system failure.

119
00:06:57,156 --> 00:07:01,159
If anyone asks, tell them you're
from it restoring my hard drive.

120
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:05,302
My desk is in the last row,
three from the end, seat 86.

121
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,692
The override is well
disguised inside the desk.

122
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,539
Here is the key.

123
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:09,520
Good.

124
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,595
How much time will you need?

125
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:13,751
45 minutes to melt down
the remaining reactors.

126
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,026
I'm here if you need anything.

127
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:17,345
Where is the CTU agent?

128
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,689
Forbes is questioning him now.

129
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:15,241
He's out.

130
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,698
He's not going to tell us anything.

131
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:20,282
What does Marwan want us to do with him?

132
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,393
Finish him off.

133
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,066
Then get rid of the body.

134
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,121
Take care of it.

135
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:31,617
He came with a woman and two other agents.

136
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:32,705
Where are their bodies?

137
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:33,521
They're already in the van.

138
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,321
Yeah, here it is.

139
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,059
Galaxy financial services.

140
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:40,363
What kind of a company is it?

141
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:44,143
It's, um, a failing payroll
service I was about to dissolve,

142
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:47,311
and someone came in with an
offer to buy 51% of the shares.

143
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:49,964
Seven, 800 grand, something like that.

144
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:52,443
Here-- Harris Barnes, director.

145
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:53,393
Who is Harris Barnes?

146
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:58,335
I, uh... don't remember.

147
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,488
What do you mean you don't remember?

148
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,423
I'm involved with over 30 companies.

149
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,195
I don't deal directly with most of them.

150
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,468
Explain to me, Paul, how
your name got on the lease.

151
00:10:05,593 --> 00:10:06,165
I don't know.

152
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,009
You expect me to believe that
you entered into a business deal

153
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:11,960
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars
with someone that you'd never met?

154
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,949
Yes. My attorney handles most of the...

155
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:15,202
Paul, I don't believe you!

156
00:10:15,472 --> 00:10:16,335
Jack, it's possible.

157
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:19,192
Paul has put together a lot
of deals through his attorneys.

158
00:10:32,552 --> 00:10:33,454
This is Sarah.

159
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:34,327
Hey, it's me.

160
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,012
I need you to run a name for me.

161
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:36,723
Go ahead.

162
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:37,838
Harris Barnes.

163
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:41,492
He's the director of a cAlifornia
corporation-- galaxy financial services.

164
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:42,748
What am I looking for?

165
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,058
Where he lives, his
businesses, anything that

166
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,217
could possibly connect
with any terrorist activity.

167
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:48,787
All right, give me a minute.

168
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:49,881
I'll be here.

169
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:53,383
She's calling me right back.

170
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:54,688
Excuse me.

171
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:59,920
Oh, your boyfriend is
just a thug with a badge.

172
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:02,421
Paul, why is your name on that lease?

173
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,232
Unbelievable.

174
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:09,277
An hour ago, I was sitting here feeling

175
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:11,479
sorry for myself that
you didn't want me back.

176
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,050
And now... you think I'm a terrorist?

177
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:20,915
You think I had something to do with
you and your father's kidnapping?

178
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:22,640
I don't know what to believe anymore.

179
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,451
Yeah?

180
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:33,221
Okay, I ran down the
name Harris Barnes, and

181
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:35,329
a lot of data came up,
but it was inconsistent.

182
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:37,888
So I went into the irs records
and found out that Harris

183
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:40,186
Barnes didn't appear on their
logs until two years ago.

184
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,410
So it's an Alias.

185
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,770
As far as I can tell it's
a washed id, with a vAlid

186
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,791
social security number
and credit card history.

187
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,068
Interpol back-traced a
name and provided a list

188
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:50,002
of foreign nationals
who've used it in the past.

189
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,346
Who used it most recently?

190
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,185
A man named Habib Marwan.

191
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:55,607
Okay, we need to find him.

192
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,995
I think we already have.

193
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:57,752
What do you mean?

194
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:01,383
Marwan used the name Harris Barnes to
lease more office space here in L.A.

195
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:05,108
It turns out the same address was given
to us an hour ago by Marianne Taylor.

196
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:06,957
She and Curtis are there now.

197
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:08,193
What's the address?

198
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,111
It's the 29th floor at the
Rockland building downtown.

199
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:12,119
Okay, I'm on my way.

200
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:14,286
As soon as Curtis calls,
you patch him through to me.

201
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:14,815
You got it.

202
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,534
You think Marwan's there?

203
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,615
Right now, it's our only lead.

204
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,785
If he is, that's where the override is.

205
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:22,187
I'll get back to you.

206
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,545
I want you to tell me
who's still out there.

207
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,648
I want the name of anyone
who can help us find

208
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,849
that override to stop the
plants from melting down.

209
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:47,660
My husband kept all of this from me.

210
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:48,721
I only helped.

211
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:49,890
That's a bunch of crap.

212
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,662
Now, we know you were just
as involved as your husband.

213
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:57,208
Listen, we're quite
aware that the only reason

214
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,821
you're helping us is
because of your son.

215
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:03,005
But believe me, it's not too late for us
to change our minds about how we treat him.

216
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:13,329
There are a few men whose
names I heard Navi mention.

217
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:16,878
They might know what you want.

218
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,153
But I don't know how to find them.

219
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:25,527
All right.

220
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,189
Why don't you start by
writing the names down?

221
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:40,270
As far as we can tell, this Habib
Marwan's been controlling the override.

222
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,209
Jack's on his way there now?

223
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:44,198
Yes.

224
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,487
Curtis and his team are
already at that building.

225
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:49,232
I know, but we haven't been able
to reach him or his team members.

226
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,554
He's not answEring his cell.

227
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:52,712
How far is Jack?

228
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,032
About 15 minutes out.

229
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,362
Keep trying Curtis.

230
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:56,524
Tell him Jack's on the way.

231
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:59,147
We have to coorDinate the
two and find that override.

232
00:13:59,278 --> 00:13:59,723
Okay.

233
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,121
Tony?

234
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,653
Ask her about a man named Habib Marwan.

235
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:13,474
Who's Habib Marwan?

236
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:21,199
I heard Navi speak of him a few times.

237
00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:22,855
He's an engineer.

238
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:27,445
Beyond that, I don't know.

239
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:35,297
Miss Driscoll?

240
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:36,137
Yes?

241
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,026
This is Alison Lackey at the clinic.

242
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,287
There's a problem with your daughter Maya.

243
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:42,643
I think you should get down
here as soon as you can.

244
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:47,229
I'll be right there.

245
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:48,167
Thank you.

246
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,612
It's the CTU agent's phone.

247
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:01,480
What should we do?

248
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:02,636
Nothing.

249
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,686
Let them wonder where he is.

250
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,569
By the time they reAlize what's
happened, it will be too late.

251
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,982
Find out if Adam and Jason
have disposed of the body.

252
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,515
They should have been back by now.

253
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,233
All right.

254
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:45,629
Yeah?

255
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,112
Ali, Adam and Jason are dead.

256
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,934
Did the agent escape?

257
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:51,731
No, the door's still armed.

258
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:53,233
He's still on this floor.

259
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:55,842
- Find him.
- Yeah.

260
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:04,386
Yes.

261
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:06,462
The CTU agent is loose on this floor.

262
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:07,821
How did he escape?

263
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,228
He killed two of our men.

264
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:11,286
Does he know the override
is in the building?

265
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,078
I don't think so, and he can't get to it.

266
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:14,516
We have the exits covered.

267
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:16,080
Disconnect all the hotlines.

268
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:17,880
He can't be allowed to contact CTU.

269
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:18,761
I will.

270
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:32,496
No, no, no.

271
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:34,057
You can't keep me here!

272
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:35,907
Maya, please.

273
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:37,586
We just want to help you feel better!

274
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,793
I'll feel better when
you get out of my face!

275
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:40,360
Maya!

276
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,546
What took you so long?

277
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:44,261
I thought she was given a sedative.

278
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:44,728
We did.

279
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:45,649
She's fighting it.

280
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:46,947
Give me a few minutes with her.

281
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:47,493
Sure.

282
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:48,608
Nurse.

283
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:49,200
Honey.

284
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,348
Honey... I brought you here
so that you could be near me.

285
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:55,219
Isn't that what you wanted?

286
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:57,056
I want for us to go home.

287
00:16:57,468 --> 00:17:00,605
Maya, we will, honey, but
we can't just yet, honey.

288
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,871
I don't like these people here.

289
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:08,535
Maya, Maya, that's not going
to make you feel better.

290
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:10,432
You're wrong.

291
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:11,894
I do feel better.

292
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,577
- Sweetheart, I need you to...
- Go, get out!

293
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:22,507
You're such an important person, why don't
you take care of your important business?

294
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,356
- Maya...
- Doctor?

295
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,098
Doctor?!

296
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:28,064
Doctor?

297
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:29,421
Yes, Maya?

298
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:32,439
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,464
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,408
I was misbehaving.

301
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,233
But I promise to be good.

302
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:43,021
If you'll just get that out of here.

303
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:48,869
I'm going.

304
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:55,479
I'm going.

305
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,200
Bye.

306
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:03,581
I'll be in my office if you need me.

307
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:07,042
Come on, Maya.

308
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,218
Curtis's phone is ringing,
and he's not answEring it?

309
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:13,677
Right.

310
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,067
It rang several times
before I got his message.

311
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,682
If he had turned it off, it would
have gone to voice mail immediately.

312
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:19,617
He's in trouble.

313
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:20,626
Where are the field teams?

314
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,624
Castle and his men will
be there in two minutes.

315
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,693
I can have them set
up a staging area along

316
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:26,437
the perimeter and stand
by for your command.

317
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:29,025
What's the probability that
Marwan's even in the facility?

318
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:29,861
We don't know yet.

319
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:31,795
Where are they staging?

320
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:33,902
They'll be waiting for
you in a parking lot at the

321
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:35,951
northwest corner of wilshire
and grand, one block away.

322
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:36,476
Okay.

323
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,040
Have your people found Marwan yet?

324
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:39,592
No.

325
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:45,275
Audrey, you, you have to
know that I would never

326
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:47,547
be involved in anything
that could bring you harm.

327
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,352
Of all the people this Marwan could
approach to do business and he chose you?

328
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:52,870
It's a hell of a coincidence, Paul.

329
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:55,026
It might not just be a coincidence.

330
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:58,146
They might have wanted Paul for
more than just the corporate shell.

331
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:00,426
He chose Paul because he was my husband?

332
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:03,040
That would put them one degree
of separation from your father.

333
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:06,561
So this Marwan used me
to get to Audrey's father.

334
00:19:06,904 --> 00:19:08,045
It's a possibility.

335
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:11,388
Well, I had no idea where Audrey
or her father would be today.

336
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:14,216
The information they used to stage the
kidnapping couldn't have come from me.

337
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:16,925
They would have used your relationship
with her father for something else.

338
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:20,163
Maybe to plan something for
the future, a contingency plan.

339
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:25,114
I've been careless.

340
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:30,190
I'm so sorry.

341
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:55,449
all right, well, so far
every name Dina's given

342
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,402
us has checked out as
a mid-level cell member.

343
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:02,533
But what's interesting is that Marwan,
who she claims to have never met,

344
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,370
is connected to everyone on this list.

345
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:06,599
It looks like all roads lead to him.

346
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,458
This must be his operation.

347
00:20:10,316 --> 00:20:12,665
Which means she definitely
knows more than she's telling us.

348
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:14,829
What do you want to do to make her talk?

349
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,258
I just need you to give
me a little bit of rope.

350
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:20,368
Do it.

351
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:36,110
Why don't you tell me about Habib Marwan?

352
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,311
I already told you.

353
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:41,565
No, you told me you never met him.

354
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,248
I haven'T.

355
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:45,956
Danny, could you come in here, please?

356
00:20:56,474 --> 00:21:00,096
I'm going to need all video and audio
monitoring in this room disconnected.

357
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,641
Thank you.

358
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:08,531
I'm not a stupid woman.

359
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,447
What are you trying to prove with this?

360
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:13,968
I'm not trying to prove anything.

361
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:17,305
I just don't want what I'm
about to say to be recorded.

362
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:31,183
I don't believe you.

363
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:45,451
Open the door!

364
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,900
Everybody out.

365
00:21:49,404 --> 00:21:50,202
Get out, now!

366
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:53,906
Everyone, Erin.

367
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,330
Unless you tell me the
whole truth right now,

368
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,462
that deal you made to
save your son is over!

369
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,499
And he goes to prison
for murder and treason!

370
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,617
You can't do that.

371
00:22:18,857 --> 00:22:20,727
The president signed an agreement.

372
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:22,660
If that deal gets in the way
of protecting this country,

373
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:24,347
you think the president's
gonna stand behind it?

374
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:27,552
He's gonna tear it up, and your son
goes to prison for the rest of his life.

375
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,286
Let me tell you, I know a
little something about prison.

376
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:35,338
And based on the conditions of his
confinement, I can tell you right now,

377
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:37,839
I give behrooz about three
months before he commits suicide.

378
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:39,947
And by the way,

379
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:44,413
I'm going to make it my
personal mission to make sure

380
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:47,120
you never hear word one about
what happens to him, ever!

381
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:03,358
Wait.

382
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,210
Habib Marwan is the man our cell
reported to in the united states.

383
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:12,647
You said "your cell."

384
00:23:13,755 --> 00:23:15,145
How many other cells reported to him?

385
00:23:15,386 --> 00:23:16,297
I don't know.

386
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:17,526
But there are others?

387
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:19,723
Yes.

388
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:20,358
How many?

389
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:22,397
I told you, I don't know.

390
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,275
The cells are not in
contact with one another.

391
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:27,866
Marwan thought it was safer that way.

392
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:29,731
What about the override?

393
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:31,751
Is it in his possession right now?

394
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,014
Definitely.

395
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:33,713
Definitely?

396
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:34,377
Why definitely?

397
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:38,641
Your programmers are trying to
interfere with the meltdown sequence.

398
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:42,001
Marwan is the only one
capable of stopping them.

399
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,538
And he's trying to do this
by controlling it directly?

400
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:45,464
Exactly.

401
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:46,105
Where?

402
00:23:47,195 --> 00:23:47,799
Where?!

403
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:49,757
Somewhere in downtown.

404
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,850
The rocklyn building?

405
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:54,879
Yes.

406
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,928
Sarah Gavin.

407
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:01,776
Sarah, get me Jack Bauer on the phone.

408
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:02,449
You got it.

409
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:09,519
Place her back in holding.

410
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:12,666
Erin, Dina just confirmed
Marwan's got the override.

411
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,776
He's at the rocklyn building.

412
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:16,625
Everyone, listen up!

413
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,870
The address where Curtis is
and where Jack Bauer is heading,

414
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,647
is the location of the override.

415
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,658
I want every station to
focus on this location.

416
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:27,245
I want field teams ready.

417
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,512
Rework your assault tactics on the
building factoring in this new information.

418
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:33,772
Let me speak to Tony.

419
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:34,857
Hold on a second.

420
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:35,532
Tony.

421
00:24:35,803 --> 00:24:36,416
I've got Jack.

422
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:39,493
Jack.

423
00:24:39,748 --> 00:24:40,208
Yeah?

424
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:43,047
We have confirmation: Habib
Marwan is controlling the override.

425
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:44,143
He's at the address you're headed to.

426
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:45,018
What about Curtis?

427
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,189
No, we haven't been able to reach him yet.

428
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:49,719
Have you changed the assault profiles?

429
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:50,747
We're working on it.

430
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:52,165
Look, Marwan's the key to this.

431
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,416
He can't know we're coming or
he'll take off with the override.

432
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:55,714
Also, we're running out of time.

433
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:57,931
We've got about 20 minutes before
these plants start to melt down.

434
00:24:58,044 --> 00:25:00,521
Okay, tell Castle to prep
for a low-profile assault.

435
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:01,638
Tell him I'm on my way.

436
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:02,280
Copy that.

437
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:03,557
Get me Castle.

438
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:08,935
Ali?

439
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:10,828
Go.

440
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:13,661
Have you found him yet?

441
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:16,094
Marwan, it was not necessary
for you to come down.

442
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:17,484
Not necessary?

443
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:19,333
We will find him.

444
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,644
If I'm captured, it'll end
everything we've been working for.

445
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:23,610
We control the floor.

446
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:24,507
He can't get far.

447
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:25,971
Don't tell me what he can't do.

448
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:27,400
He's already killed two of our men.

449
00:25:30,603 --> 00:25:31,363
What is it, Forbes?

450
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:33,956
Tell me you've got him.

451
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,272
No, I'm sorry, Marwan.

452
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:36,573
He may have gotten away.

453
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:38,101
How is that possible?

454
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:39,928
Ali says the floor is locked off.

455
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,362
I know.

456
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:41,460
We're still searching.

457
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,546
But we've got to deal with
ventilation, air ducts, ceiling space...

458
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:49,374
I don't care how you get him,
as long as he's contained.

459
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:50,931
I need 30 minutes.

460
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:52,105
Can you make that happen?

461
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:53,377
I can make it happen.

462
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:55,246
30 minutes.

463
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,504
Who's Marwan?

464
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:08,870
Who is he?

465
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:10,430
Does he have the override?

466
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:19,827
Does he have the override?

467
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:21,399
Yes.

468
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:22,914
Where is he?

469
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:26,491
Where is he?

470
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:28,458
One flight up.

471
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:30,947
I don't have access to the floor.

472
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:50,882
Ctu Sarah Gavin.

473
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:52,081
Sarah, it's Curtis.

474
00:26:52,116 --> 00:26:52,980
Where's Driscoll?

475
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,871
Where have you been?

476
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:54,855
We've been trying to reach you.

477
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,096
I'm still in the rocklyn building.

478
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:56,821
Sarah, listen.

479
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:59,703
Maryanne's dead, I'm sure our
backup teams are dead, too.

480
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:01,655
The override is here.

481
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,233
Uh, Jack's on his way to you now.

482
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:20,560
Jack?

483
00:27:20,783 --> 00:27:23,453
I need you to put together a security
detail for Paul and Audrey Raines now.

484
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,182
I'll take care of it.

485
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:27,555
I want you to stay here with
these men until I get back.

486
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,293
Are you going in?

487
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:28,893
Yeah.

488
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:31,704
One second.

489
00:27:33,304 --> 00:27:33,904
This is Bauer.

490
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:35,591
Jack, it's manning.

491
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:36,567
Where are you?

492
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,434
I'm still in the building-- 29th floor.

493
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:39,252
Where are you?

494
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,244
I'm in the staging area about a block away.

495
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,061
Have you secured the override device?

496
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:44,912
No, but it's here, on an upper floor.

497
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:46,719
A man named Marwan is in control.

498
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,650
I know, CTU worked up a partial profile.

499
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:49,583
What's your mobility?

500
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:50,206
Limited.

501
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:50,873
They're still looking for me.

502
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,114
But I took an access card
off one of the hostiles.

503
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:53,988
How do we meet?

504
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:55,488
Take the main elevator.

505
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:56,874
There's only one guard posted there.

506
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,966
I'll take care of him.

507
00:27:58,016 --> 00:27:58,782
I'm on my way.

508
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:00,536
We've got Marwan boxed in.

509
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:02,849
I want you to send in your
team, reinforce the perimeter.

510
00:28:02,884 --> 00:28:05,127
I want men on the first floor
in case this thing goes hot.

511
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:05,721
Got it.

512
00:28:20,064 --> 00:28:20,917
I'll be right back.

513
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:24,556
Go, go!

514
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:39,414
That was our field agents
from the rocklyn building.

515
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:40,328
Your daughter's with them now.

516
00:28:40,363 --> 00:28:40,972
She's safe.

517
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:43,849
I don't want her anywhere near harm's way.

518
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:44,729
She won't be, sir.

519
00:28:58,295 --> 00:29:00,350
I understand we're
closing in on the override?

520
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:01,792
We hope so, sir.

521
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:04,398
We believe we've found
where the terrorists have it.

522
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:05,026
Which is where?

523
00:29:05,354 --> 00:29:06,985
In an office building in L.A.

524
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:10,207
We believe the terrorists are either
associated with one of the tenants,

525
00:29:10,564 --> 00:29:12,852
or they've created a corporation
they're hiding behind.

526
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:14,489
How is CTU proceeding?

527
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:15,778
We have teams converging.

528
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:20,864
Once we find the override, we have to
use it to reprogram the reactors manually.

529
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:22,665
Will there be enough time to reprogram?

530
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,801
Our people will be ready,
sir, once we find it.

531
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:25,567
All right.

532
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:30,375
I don't have to remind both of
you of the consequences if we fail.

533
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,173
Everyone here understands
what's at stake, sir.

534
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,435
Excuse Me, Miss Driscoll?

535
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,872
Dr. Sanford's on line two.

536
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:39,961
Excuse me, sir.

537
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:43,263
I'll meet you on the floor.

538
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,085
Yes, doctor?

539
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:52,448
I'm sorry to bother you,
but Maya's acting out again.

540
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:53,638
What is she doing?

541
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,347
She's being abusive to my staff.

542
00:29:55,382 --> 00:29:56,624
She's broken a few things.

543
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:59,996
If she doesn't settle down, I'm going to
have to move her to a private hospital.

544
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,178
We're not equipped to
handle a patient like Maya.

545
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:03,121
All right, don't do anything.

546
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:05,127
I'll be right there.

547
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:15,339
Sarah?

548
00:30:15,374 --> 00:30:15,944
Excuse me.

549
00:30:16,873 --> 00:30:18,624
Is Edgar still online with NRC?

550
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,180
Yes.

551
00:30:19,636 --> 00:30:21,593
They found any alternate
ways to stop the meltdowns?

552
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,038
Not without the override, no.

553
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:24,679
What's happening at the rocklyn building?

554
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:26,080
Castle just called in.

555
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:27,861
His teams are spread out on the perimeter.

556
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:28,737
What about Curtis?

557
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,927
He's about to meet up with
Jack inside the building.

558
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:32,331
Okay, where are you monitoring?

559
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:33,116
Station three.

560
00:30:33,151 --> 00:30:34,461
All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.

561
00:30:34,651 --> 00:30:36,237
Make sure everything's
ready and calm if Jack

562
00:30:36,238 --> 00:30:37,755
and Curtis get their
hands on the override.

563
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,177
OK.

564
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:44,411
You're a cruel person.

565
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:45,394
Do you know that?

566
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:46,342
Maya, please.

567
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:47,986
This is a restricted area.

568
00:30:48,021 --> 00:30:49,363
You have to stay in your bed.

569
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:50,489
Stay in my bed?

570
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:51,581
What am I, a baby?

571
00:30:52,237 --> 00:30:52,794
Maya!

572
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:54,734
What do you want, mother?

573
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,244
Don'T.

574
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:59,889
Please, don't treat these
people disrespectfully.

575
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:02,875
Please don't tell me what to do!

576
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:09,354
I'll stop telling you what to do
when you stop behaving like a child.

577
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:09,915
What?

578
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:10,816
You heard me.

579
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:17,108
There are other people in this world
besides you and they have problems, too.

580
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:19,909
Now, are you gonna
get a grip on yourself

581
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:23,914
or am I going to have to call
security and have them restrain you?

582
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:25,579
You're pathetic, you know that?

583
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:28,638
I will not allow you
to talk to me like this.

584
00:31:28,673 --> 00:31:29,302
I will not!

585
00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:31,197
What are you going to do about it?

586
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:41,710
I...

587
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,280
I just want to get out of here, mommy.

588
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:52,155
And I will take you home,

589
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,396
but I have something
I have to finish first.

590
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:02,473
- No...
- It's okay.

591
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:07,505
Are we clear?

592
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:10,565
Yeah.

593
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,017
Good.

594
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:16,767
That's my girl.

595
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:45,349
We've got a man down.

596
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:46,405
Take the wall.

597
00:32:54,732 --> 00:32:55,496
You okay?

598
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,523
Yeah, I overheard a phone conversation
between Marwan and one of his men.

599
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:00,746
We have less than 15 minutes.

600
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,755
How many are still Alive?

601
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:03,016
I'm not sure. But at least four.

602
00:33:03,437 --> 00:33:04,526
Have your men secure the floor.

603
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:06,044
Curtis and I are going after the override.

604
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:06,474
Which way?

605
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:07,061
This way.

606
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:09,117
What about backup?

607
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:11,617
No backup-- we can't let
Marwan know we're coming.

608
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,318
What's upstairs?

609
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:15,384
Ids data systems.

610
00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:18,079
My guess is Marwan somehow
inserted a sleeper into the company.

611
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,168
They must have used
their servers to download

612
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:21,766
the virus into the nuclear power plants.

613
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:23,351
By piggybacking on ids hardware.

614
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:23,829
Yeah.

615
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:25,060
Take the door.

616
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:25,668
All right.

617
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:30,354
Clear.

618
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:10,696
Step away from the door, ma'am.

619
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:12,389
I need you to exit the building.

620
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:13,043
It's an emergency.

621
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:15,385
You ready?

622
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:15,783
Yeah.

623
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:16,755
Let's go.

624
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:33,694
Did you get a description on him?

625
00:34:34,296 --> 00:34:34,831
No.

626
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:36,773
It could be anyone.

627
00:36:00,044 --> 00:36:00,975
Hey, bob, what's going on?

628
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:42,945
Yes?

629
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:44,002
Marwan, it's Ali.

630
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,145
We've been discovered!

631
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:48,805
Ali?

632
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:55,674
Make sure all the exits
are covered on all floors.

633
00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:56,500
Roger that.

634
00:36:57,927 --> 00:36:58,655
Last man down.

635
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:37,688
Curtis!

636
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:48,163
Stay down!

637
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:53,552
Stay down!

638
00:37:54,728 --> 00:37:55,509
I got this exit!

639
00:37:56,015 --> 00:37:56,612
You got him?

640
00:37:56,784 --> 00:37:57,277
No!

641
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:02,105
Jack, I have the override!

642
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:03,322
Secure it!

643
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,882
Call CTU now!

644
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:06,875
Now!

645
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:09,506
I got him!

646
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:16,242
Driscoll.

647
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:17,404
Erin, it's Curtis.

648
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:18,338
I have the override.

649
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:18,949
Put Edgar on.

650
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:19,804
Edgar, line one.

651
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,601
It's Curtis.

652
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:21,440
He has the override.

653
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:22,399
This is Edgar Stiles.

654
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,483
Is the override logged in?

655
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:24,073
Yes.

656
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,281
Send it to channel 11.

657
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:27,828
I can'T.

658
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:29,081
What do you mean you can't?

659
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,013
All the fields are write-protected.

660
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,054
It's not supposed to be.

661
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:33,764
If you're directly
plugged into the override,

662
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,225
you should be able to
do anything you want.

663
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,636
Yeah, I'm telling you, it's locked up.

664
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:37,480
What do you want me to do?

665
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:38,856
Miss Driscoll, the clinic just called.

666
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:39,999
Tell them they're going to have to wait.

667
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,325
- They said it was an...
- Tell them!

668
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:45,100
Edgar, we're out of time.

669
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:46,508
If you're going to do something, do it now.

670
00:38:46,714 --> 00:38:47,953
Marwan was the engineer on the project.

671
00:38:47,988 --> 00:38:49,714
He must've modified
the override to do this.

672
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:52,649
The NRC screen is showing the
meltdown stage is already beginning.

673
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:54,010
Edgar, do something!

674
00:38:54,428 --> 00:38:55,669
Curtis, there must be a hot key.

675
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:57,097
There's a lot of keys, Edgar.

676
00:38:57,132 --> 00:38:58,578
I can't just try random combinations.

677
00:38:58,712 --> 00:38:59,437
It'll take too long.

678
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:01,239
Press the function keys one at a time.

679
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,053
The status window on the bottom will
light up when you get to an active one.

680
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:05,737
F5.

681
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:07,225
Good, hold it down and press "escape."

682
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:08,226
Nothing.

683
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:11,566
Try F5, shift, escape.

684
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,563
Okay, it's responding.

685
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:15,717
Good, set it to channel 11.

686
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:16,195
Hurry up.

687
00:39:18,181 --> 00:39:20,738
Edgar, now they have three
plants in meltdown initiation.

688
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:35,813
Did you get it?

689
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:37,547
I hope so.

690
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:48,989
It's starting to respond.

691
00:39:58,887 --> 00:39:59,367
Yes!

692
00:39:59,402 --> 00:39:59,847
Yes!

693
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:03,836
The temperature is dropping
on all remaining power plants.

694
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:06,405
Good work.

695
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:11,728
Congratulations, Edgar!

696
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:21,694
Great work, Erin.

697
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:23,112
Thank you, sir.

698
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:24,616
Excuse me.

699
00:40:56,516 --> 00:40:57,081
Maya?

700
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,297
Where is she?

701
00:41:00,286 --> 00:41:00,908
Maya?

702
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:04,619
Oh!

703
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,191
Oh!

704
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,230
Oh, baby...

705
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:14,879
Oh...

706
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:27,005
It's over, sir.

707
00:41:27,815 --> 00:41:29,156
We've stopped the meltdown.

708
00:41:58,808 --> 00:41:59,525
This is Bauer.

709
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:00,773
We got a man down.

710
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:03,765
Marwan is in the northwest
stairwell headed to ground level.

711
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,126
Does anybody read me?

712
00:42:06,178 --> 00:42:08,170
Jack, it's Castle. I'll get man up there.

713
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:24,371
All CTU agents: Marwan is
impersonating a CTU officer.

714
00:42:24,406 --> 00:42:27,276
I repeat, the suspect is
impersonating a CTU officer.

715
00:42:33,188 --> 00:42:34,918
Solaris, do you read me?
