about this the last time
I saw him, you know.

1757
01:36:40,526 --> 01:36:45,563
Then, heh, your fiancée
came out of the blue, you know.

1758
01:36:45,631 --> 01:36:48,115
Oh, she wanted me
to tell you...

1759
01:36:48,183 --> 01:36:51,218
Uh... she wanted me to give you
a little message, uh,

1760
01:36:51,286 --> 01:36:53,788
about setting up
a new wedding date for you.

1761
01:36:53,855 --> 01:36:54,822
Heh.
Yeah.

1762
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:58,225
Thank you.
Yeah, Wade.

1763
01:36:58,293 --> 01:37:01,062
You get some rest now, okay?

1764
01:37:01,129 --> 01:37:03,698
Hey, uh...

1765
01:37:03,765 --> 01:37:05,666
John went out the way
he wanted.

1766
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:09,070
They never broke him.

1767
01:37:09,138 --> 01:37:10,271
No.

1768
01:37:12,574 --> 01:37:14,341
No, they didn't.

1769
01:37:14,409 --> 01:37:16,176
(♪)

1770
01:37:31,059 --> 01:37:33,694
JOHN: <i>Usually I'm quoting
someone else's words.</i>

1771
01:37:33,762 --> 01:37:37,048
The least I can do is give you
<i>some John Smith originals.</i>

1772
01:37:37,115 --> 01:37:38,967
<i>They won't be poetic.</i>

1773
01:37:39,034 --> 01:37:40,534
<i>But they'll be the truth.</i>

1774
01:37:40,636 --> 01:37:43,738
Close 13!

1775
01:37:46,074 --> 01:37:47,108
What's up, come on, man.

1776
01:37:47,176 --> 01:37:49,277
I'm supposed to be in PC
the rest of my fucking term.

1777
01:37:49,344 --> 01:37:51,312
Jackson said...
Jackson's dead.

1778
01:37:55,884 --> 01:37:56,951
You can get up.

1779
01:37:57,019 --> 01:38:00,254
JOHN:
<i>Yes, prison desensitizes you.</i>

1780
01:38:00,406 --> 01:38:02,273
<i>But it also forces you to see</i>

1781
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,575
<i>what's most important.</i>

1782
01:38:04,643 --> 01:38:07,912
<i>Family. And loyalty.</i>

1783
01:38:07,979 --> 01:38:11,365
<i>Because a con like you knows
neither exists in this place.</i>

1784
01:38:17,773 --> 01:38:21,909
<i>So don't run from who
you've become, felon.</i>

1785
01:38:21,977 --> 01:38:23,144
<i>Embrace it.</i>

1786
01:38:23,211 --> 01:38:24,662
<i>Grow from it.</i>

1787
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:28,182
<i>And you'll never lose sight
of what truly matters.</i>

1788
01:38:29,718 --> 01:38:34,004
<i>That's my final piece
of advice, Wade Porter.</i>

1789
01:38:34,072 --> 01:38:35,723
<i>You protect your
family at all costs.</i>

1790
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:38,826
<i>Even if you're forced
to kill again.</i>

1791
01:38:38,894 --> 01:38:41,129
<i>Because if I had
to, I'd wipe out</i>

1792
01:38:41,196 --> 01:38:43,797
<i>the whole planet
to get mine back.</i>

1793
01:38:52,841 --> 01:38:54,391
<i>So long, friend.</i>

1794
01:39:05,203 --> 01:39:08,139
