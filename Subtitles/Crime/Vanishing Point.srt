- I'm going out again.

317
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,630
Maybe I'll catch an eight-footer.

318
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,388
Oh! I'll ride it in your honour.

319
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,830
Sayonara. Remember me.

320
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,952
Here we are at point zero
where the Kowalski saga began.

321
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,352
To be interviewed by KLZ TV News is
the owner of the agency, Mr Holly Makas,

322
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,476
and one of the attendants, Sandy McKees.

323
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,916
Sandy, you knew this man best.
What do you think of Kowalski?

324
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,355
- He's a great driver.
- A what?

325
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,070
- What did you say?
- I said he's a great driver.

326
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,118
- We knew that.
- You won't find a driver like him anywhere...

327
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,839
But as a professional,
he never really made the grade.

328
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,514
Well, you know why?
He never really wanted to.

329
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,434
So far as I'm concerned, he was
number one then, and he is number one now.

00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,669
<i>(Cheering)</i>

331
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,719

Why don't they let him alone?

332
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,473
Let the guy alone!
Look, he never done any harm.

333
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,154
This is Bob Palmer
of KLZ TV News in Denver.

334
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,471
Super Soul needs no introduction
as our number one disc jockey,

335
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,996
but he's on his way to becoming
a national celebrity in his own right,

336
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,709
- as the invisible guide of Kowalski.
- The blind leading the blind.

337
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,759
Kowalski was involved in a cross-country
chase starting in Denver, Colorado.

338
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,951
Stay right where you are, son.

339
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,750
Don't move, stranger. Don't move.

340
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,511
I'll get him for ya.
I'll get him. I'll get him.

341
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,633
Stick your pretty little head
right through there, baby.

342
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,518
That's it. Now we got him.

343

Now we'll get our basket over here.

344
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,949
Look at that. Live and wrigglin'.
Yeah, ain't that a beauty?

345
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,831
Oh!

346
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,911
Ain't that a fat one, though?

347
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,550
Now we'll get him in here.

348
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,915
Thank you, son. That's got him.

349
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,039
Thank you. How many do you have in there?

350
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:58,309
I've got six rattlers, two sidewinders, and now
we've got one very precious diamondback.

351
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,389
- What do you do with those things?
- Trade 'em.

352
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,190
Trade 'em for coffee, sugar,
chewin' tobacco, salt, flour and beans.

353
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,033
Lots of beans, son!

That's no way to get the hell out.

371
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,959
No, the best way, to my knowledge,
to get away, is to root right in where you are.

372
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,679

bantering the stream of unconsciousness

645
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,832
and peddling his labels
for the sake of good music

646
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,639
to all you listeners out there.

647
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:59,033
But I'm here on Sunday
for the first time in my life,

648
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,749
and for the very first time
this KOW radio station begins,

649
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:08,233
not only to DJ and to do my own thing,
but to tell you a little story.

650
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,353
<i>Now let's start at the beginning.</i>
<i>But before we start,</i>

651
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:15,069
<i>here's some</i>
<i>early Sunday morning wake-up music.</i>

652
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,310
# <i>Sing out for Jesus</i>

653
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,710
# <i>When you're tired and troubled,</i>
<i>come to Jesus</i>

654
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,473
# <i>He's the man that really cares</i>

655
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,279
- # <i>Come sing this song</i>
- # <i>Sing out for Jesus</i>

656
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,078
# <i>Praise Jesus the Lord</i>

657
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,918
And today, in a beautiful gesture
made by beautiful people,

658
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,514
in beautiful downtown Goldfield,

659
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:28,313
this radio station was named KOWalski,
in honour of the last American hero,

660
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,915
to whom speed means freedom of the soul.

661
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:37,436
The question is not when's he gonna stop,
but who is gonna stop him.

663
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,511
Hello, Kowalski. Kowalski.

664
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,511
Please listen, Kowalski.

665
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:36,470
Oh, it's useless.

666
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,311
Cut it off, man.

667
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,958
Stop!
