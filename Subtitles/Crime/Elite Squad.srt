00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:51,844
"Dendê Hill is though to invade"

3
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:55,719
"We will have fun killing our enemies."

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,516
"And I'll tell you how things work here."

5
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:03,094
"We don't take easy even with DRE."

6
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:06,984
"Even BOPE tremples to come here."

7
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,844
"We don't take easy with the army,
local police or military police."

8
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:15,016
"I will tell you something, my friend."

9
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:18,719
"Dendê Hill is also land of God!"

10
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:21,359
"Faith in God! DJ!!!"

11
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,031
"Let's go!"

12
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:41,547
Rio de Janeiro got more than
seven hundred 'favelas'.

13
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:46,094
Most of all rulled by drug dealers
armed until their teeth.

14
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:51,969
People with AR-15,
pistol Uzi, HK and so on...

15
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:56,610
All over the world these
weapons are used to make war.

16
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,328
On Rio, they are
the crime weapons.

17
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,360
A shot by .762 goes through a
car just like it would on paper.

18
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,735
It's stupid to think a policemen would
enter the hill just to keep the law.

19
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,906
Policemen got family, my friend.
Policemen has afraid to die too.

20
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:22,203
Let's go, this way. Go, go!

21
00:02:24,406 --> 00:02:26,953
It is why, in this city,
every policeman got a choice.

22
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,110
To corrupt himself, to disguise
himself or to go to the war!

23
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:37,766
Most of peoples don't like war.

24
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:41,516
Major Oliveira wasn't an exception.

25
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:45,000
Every friday they went to
collect the "arrego".

26
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,828
Wich is the money they charge the
dealers for them to keep their activities.

27
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:51,781
Attention, Marcim!

28
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:55,109
- The worms are comming!
- Let them come, it's all right.

29
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:58,766
Drug dealers live on war,
but they also wants to survive.

30
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:02,250
Why shoot the police if they can negotiate?

31
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:08,985
But that night there was a policeman
who wasn't there to collect money.

32
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:13,656
It were Cpt. Fábio. He was there against
his will. And he was also scared to death.

33
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:27,266
If Fávio wasn't on that "Patamo", Neto
and Matias wouldn't be entering the hill.

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,422
Neto and Matias would never disguise
themselves, neither corrupt theirselves.

35
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,750
They were honest.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,500
- Did they exit the car already?
- Do you see Fábio there?

37
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:02,550
- Don't do this, captain.
- The hill is sweet today.

38
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,459
- Will you left me unarmed?
- Let's go you sick fuck.

39
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,687
- Do you see Fábio there?
- Let me handle this.

40
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,734
Are you seeing?

41
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:10,391
- Do you see Fábio there?
- Take it easy, man.

42
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:14,906
What's up, Oliveira?

43
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:18,800
The truth is that peace in Rio
depends on a fragile balance

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,469
between the dealers ammo
and the police corruption.

45
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,828
Honesty is not in the game.

46
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,812
- Do you see?
- Let me handle this.

47
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,687
- What the fuck...
- Have you already seen Fábio?

48
47
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:32,906
What's happening, man?

49
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:35,328
What...

50
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:39,375
It's a unsteady balance
that can be broke with a

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,375
single breeze. Storm has blown
hardly that night on Babilônia.

52
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,828
Matias and Neto dicided to
go to the war on that night.

53
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:48,999
- Who did you shoot?
- Let's go, let's go!

54
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,300
- What the fuck is going on?
- Two worms running here!

55
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
- Stay with me!
- Who did you shoot?

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Fuck!

57
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Fuck that shit, Marcim, Activity!

58
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,000
Activity there, Marcim! Two
worms going to your direction!

59
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,000
Fuck you, are you messing with us?

60
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,000
What do think? Are you messing with us?

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We're so fucked up!

62
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Out of the way!

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Son of a whore!

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Fuck! We're so fucked up!

66
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,000
We are going to die, man!

67
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,900
We are going to die!

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't stop shooting!

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
- We are going to die!
- No! Just keep it cool, buddy.

70
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,999
I am running out of ammo!

71
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,234
- Tranquility, calmness! Just this!

72
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,234
- Let's go up there and do our job
with tranquility and calmness!

73
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:13,562
- It may be a crowd up there because
there is a funk dance party today.

74
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:17,109
- So we are going to reach there slowly.
It may be injuried cops there.

75
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,268
- So we ought to stay calm!

76
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:20,307
If there would be only
the common police in Rio,

77
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:22,907
drug dealers would have
already taken control.

78
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:27,360
It is why there is BOPE, special
operation squad of the military police.

79
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,406
- Who among you knows Babilônia hill?

80
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,547
- I know, zero-one!

81
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:32,484
- So you're going to lead the operation!

82
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:34,890
- It is nearby the main avenue.

83
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:38,469
On the theory, BOPE is a
part of the military police.

84
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:42,172
On the real world, it is a
completely different police.

85
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:47,516
BOPE symbol makes clear what
happens when we invade a "favela".

86
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,750
And our uniforn isn't blue. It's black.

87
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:52,750
- BOPE arrived! Let's go there!
- Nobody will enter!

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
- You'll stay right there where
you are! Nobody will enter!

89
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,391
BOPE was created to interfere when
the common police isn't able to do so.

90
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,422
And it happens all the time on Rio.

91
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:07,406
- Knife on the skull and nothing on
the wallace! (No identification).

92
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:16,000
My name is Cpt. Nascimento.
I was the BOPE alfa team leader.

93
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,016
I was on that war since a long
time ago. And I was tired of it.

94
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:04,016
BORNING

95
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:07,031
- Oh, dear! I wish I could be there
with you now, but I'm working here.

96
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:16,109
- Can you hear his heart?
Put it there for me.

97
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,406
- "Caramba", it beats
so hardly, doesn't it?

98
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:24,484
- Very fast, isn't it?

99
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:28,234
- My love, I really have to go
because I'm working here!

100
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,438
- No, it isn't necessary, I'll warm it
up on the micro-waves when I arrive.

101
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:34,203
- All right!

102
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:38,781
The only way to stop this war is to
take over all the criminals weapons.

103
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:41,859
- The target is locked up, captain.

104
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,453
It is why the main objective of
BOPE isn't arrest drug dealers.

105
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,125
It is to capture weapons!

106
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:48,453
- What's up, Pompeu?

107
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,125
- Did you bring the pieces?
- Yes, I did.

108
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:52,953
- Bring them!
- Ok!

109
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:58,859
On my time, Military Police had 30000
unable and mispayed men with weapons.

110
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,016
BOPE had only 100 cops.

111
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:06,488
- Holy dick, how I wish to shoot
all those sons of whores...

112
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,094
- Wich one, my captain, just tell me.

113
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:09,875
- These PM (Military Police)
sons of whores! 

114
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:14,625
For each weapon we captured,
three more used to replace it.

115
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:18,844
- 14, let them make their delivery!
Renam will catch them down there!

116
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:24,047
I have lost count of how many nights I
spent cleaning up some cop corruption!

117
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:28,234
- 01, we could kill two rabbits
with a single strike here, hum?

118
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:30,547
- Is it 100%, 14?

119
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,438
- Skull, my captain!

120
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,547
- So "Load the Finger" (shoot)
at this shit!

121
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:39,250
For me, who helps drug dealers
to get weapons, is their abetter.

122
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:00,031
Oh, yeah, my friend, I have to admit!

123
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,359
I was really with a short pavio.

124
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:06,969
And my life was turning out to
be even more complicated yet.

125
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:40,891
- Good morning!

126
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:42,016
- Good morning, my love.

127
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:45,328
- Let me take it before I...

128
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:47,031
- Wait, I have set up the table...

129
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:50,656
- I got to go now, I got
to arrive earlier there.

130
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:53,891
- Damn, Beto, you have already arrived late
yesterday and is going out on a rush now?

131
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:59,219
- I have badly slept tonight!

132
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:01,172
- Are you ok? Is the baby alright?

133
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:04,331
- How can it be alright if I stay here
waiting for you? He feels my anxiety.

134
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,031
- He hasn't gained weight
last time, had he?

135
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:11,453
- What do you want me
to do? Stop working?

136
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:15,297
- If I knew you wouldn't quit,
I would not get pregnancy!

137
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:18,984
A war always charges its price!

138
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:24,375
And when the price becomes too
high, it is time to get out!

139
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:29,172
- Wait, my love, take a
little bread... Beto?

140
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:37,547
If you miss the time, you can loose
the chance of get out in one piece.

141
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:42,922
I was in need of a substitute.

142
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,422
But it is not easy to
become a BOPE Captain.

143
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:51,109
And to find someone honest, brave,
someone who had a police heart

144
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:54,000
and a police mind to replace
me would be almost impossible!

145
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:57,031
- Captain Fábio, manutention boss
and commander of the 1st. company.

146
00:11:57,406 --> 00:12:00,266
- Captain Oliveira, 3st. session
boss of the Major State.

147
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:03,797
When the guy is an idealistic one and
studies three years to become a cop,

148
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:05,813
the first day on duty matters.

149
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,359
But with time, most of them slow down.

150
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:16,672
- Welcome. Do not forget you will
be  daily evaluated since now,

151
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:21,250
- by me and by my Major State!

152
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:27,688
- I want you to know that this team,
wich I have the honor to command,

153
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,500
- is more than a big family. It is one
among the best on the coorporation.

154
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:36,375
- Estêvão, take them to their functions.

155
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:37,688
- Yes, sir!

156
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:40,109
I didn't know Matias and Neto.

157
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,016
- Dismissed.

158
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:46,438
I didn't know I would need one's
brain and another's heart!

159
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:50,391
If I could mix them together
this story would be different!

160
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,422
It would not be difficult to quit BOPE.

161
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,547
But who said life's easy?

162
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:58,312
- It is here where you
are going to work...

163
00:12:58,547 --> 00:12:59,359
- Is this shit a workshop?

164
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:00,859
- Yes, it is. Any problem?

165
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:04,165
- Sir, couldn't you give me another
function? I know nothing about cars!

166
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,015
- Officer pay attention: there are 46 cars and
12 bikes! Your job is to make them roll!

167
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:12,031
- It is not moving...
- How are you guys?

168
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:14,937
- Captain!
- Confortable.

169
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:17,406
- Officer.

170
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,719
- They are your assistants.

171
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:21,156
- How are you?

172
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:26,187
- Boss, 249 will be running
today as I promised to you.

173
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,125
- Not without a long time.

174
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:31,469
- Oh, yeah. But the new parts
you asked for haven't came yet.
- It's true!

175
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,578
- This is why I'm working
on the gear here...

176
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,140
- But this car is brand new one!

177
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:36,765
- Is it here just because
the glass is broken?

178
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,156
- You can say the glass is
broken, but look at this.

179
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:41,609
- I had to fix the engine,
the gear is not working...

180
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:43,544
- All rigth, all right. I don't want
to know about this shit anymore.

181
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,453
- It is not my "dick" (problem) 
anymore. It is his "dick"!

182
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:49,000
- Hello there, my princess!
- Officer!

183
181
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,562
- Lieutenant!

184
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:51,390
- Comfortable!

185
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:52,516
- Make yourself confortable too, officer.

186
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,172
- Bread with ham, coffee, cold water...

187
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:56,360
- I'm not hungry!

188
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:58,610
- Let's start work! I don't want
to stay here all day long.

189
00:13:58,969 --> 00:13:59,578
Let's go!

190
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:00,778
- No parts, no job...

191
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,485
- You got to talk with captain Fábio!

192
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,510
- He knows what to do to get the parts.

193
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,610
- All right. So let's stop
talking and start working!

194
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,610
- I don't want to stay
here all day long!

195
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,610
- Drop this bread and go to work!
- Sir Lieutenant, no parts, no job!

196
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,610
- I don't want to know. I want
to see everybody working here!

197
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:19,719
Neto was an impulsive guy!
He uses to act before thinking.

198
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:23,328
Matias uses to think
a lot before acting.

199
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,469
Do you see this stack of papers?

200
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,766
Each paper is an occurrence, a crime
PM didn't prevent from happening.

201
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:32,266
On Neto hands, this stack
would become a pyre!

202
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:35,438
On Matias', it would
become statistics.

203
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:38,203
This is officer Matias, he will work
here with you starting today!

204
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:40,063
How are you, boss?

205
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:43,360
Officer, they will be your assistants.
Cabo Bruno and Soldier Machado.

206
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:47,078
Your job is to keep the radio on
and to tabulate the occurrences.

207
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,516
- Is it alright?
- Yes, Sir!

208
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,578
- That is your desk!
- Sorry, boss!

209
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,282
- Any question you can call me!
Good job for all of you!

210
00:14:53,563 --> 00:14:55,969
None of both were at my level!

211
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:58,375
But one of them would replace me!

212
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:11,672
- All right, class. Well...

213
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:16,657
- One of these ten books
will be the subject...

214
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:18,938
Matias was smart and dedicated!

215
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:22,563
A guy who borns black and poor on
Brasil doesn't have many chances!

216
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:26,891
- You will have to form a
group of four members...

217
00:15:29,282 --> 00:15:31,532
- Let's go. I want to do the Foucault!
- Doesn't matter to me.

218
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:34,922
- We have three members,
we need one more...

219
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:38,407
But Matias accomplished to study at
the best law college on Rio de Janeiro!

220
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,375
- Hey, are you already in a group?
- Yes, I am!

221
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:43,422
In his head, to study law had every
thing to do with his work on police!

222
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:46,860
For him, a lawyer and a cop
had almost the same job!

223
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:48,922
They had to defend the law!

224
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,766
- He will not even notice
there are only three members!

225
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:55,891
- We had to form the group first!

226
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:58,922
- Someone will take the Foucault!
He will not notice, I'm sure!

227
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:01,000
- Is it here the sociology class?
- What's your name?

228
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:03,094
- André!
- André what?

229
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:04,625
- André Matias! Why?

230
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,094
- You are in our Foucault
group, all right? - What?

231
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:09,360
- I will explain to you.
Wait a second!

232
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:14,360
Matias head was in an ideal world,
far from reality of Rio de Janeiro.

233
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,360
- Hi, my name is Maria.
- Nice to meet you!

234
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:20,360
- They are Dudu, Roberta, we
will do a Foucault homework...

235
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:23,360
But to be a BOPE officer, a guy
needs to know where he's walking!

236
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:25,360
Matias had a lot to learn!

237
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:31,390
- You know this citizen
comming up, don't you?

238
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:35,565
- What you don't know is that he will
sleep one night here at Turano hill!

239
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:36,828
- Are you kidding, Carvalho?

240
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,953
- We are going to guarantee
his sweet dreams with angels!

241
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,437
- Turano hill on war and Pope is
going to spent one night there?

242
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:46,078
- I'll pay for him to stay at copacabana!

243
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:48,234
- I spent one month telling
the Defense Secretary so.

244
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:50,265
- But not even God can
change Pope's itinerary!

245
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:51,906
- He will sleep there and this is it!

246
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:55,218
- We have around three months to
stop this war on Turano hill!

247
00:16:55,468 --> 00:16:57,562
- We're going to do daily incursions!

248
00:16:57,812 --> 00:17:00,859
- I'm sorry, but do you
agree with daily incursions?

249
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:05,515
- Will we go there at night and at day,
with no surprise effect, under heavy fire...

250
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,203
- Nascimento!
- People are going to die!

251
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:11,906
- Nascimento! It's what is going to
be done. Operation starts tomorrow.

252
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:13,953
- Did I made myself clear?
- Yes, Sir!

253
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:15,234
- Dismissed.

254
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,750
I know the Pope can't take
the blame of my problems!

255
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,515
But he has already came to Rio twice!

256
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,734
Didn't he know how it is around here?

257
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:31,906
Of course, no politician wants to
see the Pope getting shot at his city!

258
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:35,906
If Pope wants to sleep nearby a "favela",
what do you think the governor will do?

259
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:40,046
Take the chance of Pope getting
a lost bullet in his head?

260
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:41,812
Of course not!

261
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,968
He will call BOPE!

262
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,500
- Fuck, Neto. Stop this shit, brother.

263
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:52,922
- I am studying here, man!

264
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:58,000
- Fuck you, you got to stop studying!
Let's go take a walk around the city!

265
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,031
- Will you need the car tomorrow?

266
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:02,297
- What for do you want my car?

267
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,391
- I'm going to the Pleasures Hill!

268
00:18:04,938 --> 00:18:06,422
- Are you crazy? What are you
going to do on a "favela"?

269
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:09,141
- My college group decided to
gather there to do a research!

270
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,547
- You're a cop. You can't simply
go there! They can kill you there!

271
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:14,828
- Do this research only by
yourself, you can do it!

272
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,860
- Keep cool, nobody on
college knows I am a cop!

273
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,219
- Be carefull!

274
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,156
Pope was in need of BOPE!

275
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:28,735
BOPE was in need of me!

276
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,578
And I was in need of a substitute!

277
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:33,516
It would not be easy!

278
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:36,563
I would have to keep invading
"favelas" because of the Pope!

279
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:39,641
But I would invade armed, buddy!

280
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:41,844
And wearing a black uniform!

281
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:53,828
A problem that occurs to a cop who
wants to study at a college is that,

282
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,785
with a first glance, students are
good people! And there are lots of

283
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,860
well intentioned girls!

284
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:00,891
- It is good to see you!

285
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,845
- This is Rose!
- Nice to meet you!

286
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:06,759
- This is Lhana!
- Hi there!

287
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:08,459
- This one is handsome. The
other one was so stonewashed!

288
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:10,174
- So horny...

289
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:11,766
- That's what we need.

290
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,330
- Don't look up, hun?
- Enjoy yourself!

291
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:19,968
- Sorry for make you come here,
but we have a lot of homework!

292
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,912
- This is the administration room!

293
00:19:23,002 --> 00:19:26,333
- This is Rodrigues
- Rodrigues, André!

294
00:19:26,502 --> 00:19:30,333
- He's our sponsors representant.

295
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,809
- Besides, he's a great friend of mine.

296
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,904
- Do you got a name for senate?
Now you do!

297
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:40,117
- Senator Magalhães, 451!
Take more to give to your friends!

298
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:41,899
- Take More!

299
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,094
- Don't forget: 5 - 1 = 4!
4 + 1 = 5! 451!

300
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:48,048
I recognize at first
sight it's hard to resist!

301
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:51,123
Rich student likes
to help poor children!

302
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:54,688
Who doesn't feel sorry
for poor children?

303
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:58,733
- Romerito, this is André!
- What's up, big boy?

304
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,177
- Let's go to the flip, godmother?

305
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:04,111
- Godmother can't go today,
I got plenty of homework!

306
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,476
- What about you?
- I'll do it later!

307
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:10,029
- What have you promised
to me about studying?

308
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,914
Matias was unexperienced
and he had a big heart!

309
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:16,239
It was natural for
him to get involved!

310
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,163
- He's not going well at the school.
- Do you know what's happening?

311
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:20,975
- He simply doesn't want to study!

312
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:22,848
- Maybe there's another reason!

313
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:30,420
He has to impose limits
on the rigth time.

314
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:20,982
If a guy doesn't take care, he
could be seducted by his friends.

315
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:27,732
The right thing to do
was to bust them all.

316
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:30,456
A policeman has to impose the law.

317
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,455
Matias had just started the college
and was already taking easy with them.

318
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:48,511
- Romerito? Didn't you tell me
you would go home to study?

319
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:50,511
- Nah...

320
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,050
- Blinding...

321
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:55,071
If he wasn't really taking care,
he could turn out one of them.

322
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
- Wait, wait! Wait a second!

323
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,000
- Would you borrow me your hand?
- What are you going to do?

324
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01, 200
- I think these kids are right...

325
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:11,511
- What letter is this?

326
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:14,289
- It's an 'A'!
- All right! Now, what letter is this?

327
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,432
- I'm not seeing...
What letter is this?

328
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:18,155
- It's also an 'A'!
- An 'A'?

329
00:22:18,455 --> 00:22:22,611
- He has to wear glasses.
Haven't you ever realized that?

330
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:24,954
- It might be why he's
not going well at school.

331
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:27,829
- I had the same problem at his age.

332
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,162
- Let's go tell your mother!

333
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,384
- Come on with us, André!
- But where is it? Up there?

334
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:33,717
- Yeah, it's very close...

335
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:40,076
To be a BOPE captain, Matias would
have to learn to show no mercy!

336
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:43,701
Drug dealears don't forgive.

337
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,872
- What's up, Tim?
- I did that test!

338
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:53,536
- Did you pass?
- It was very easy.

339
00:22:53,926 --> 00:22:56,400
- Do you see it worths to study, Romerito?

340
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,105
- Don't worry. They got social conscience!
Keep cool, don't worry!

341
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:02,669
- I am cool!
- Be my guest.

342
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:05,353
- Hey Alex!

343
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:09,058
- Bye, Roberta!
- By guys!

344
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:11,652
- I don't want to wear glasses.
- He also wears glasses.

345
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:13,414
- Hey Maria
- What?

346
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,417
- I got to go.
- Already?

347
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,792
- It is time to take back my friend's car

348
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:22,197
- About his glasses, I will pay for them

349
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:25,542
- I'll take him to the
doctor and everything.

350
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:29,357
- It's not needed. We can
get them through the NGO.

351
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:31,490
- Someone did it to
me when I was a child.

352
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,514
- I want to do it for him.
- That's rgith then...

353
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:41,629
- I'll come back to visit you some day.
- It's an appointment, hun! Bye.

354
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:49,224
- What's up, Baiano!

355
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:53,472
Baiano was in charge
on NGO "favela".

356
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:58,939
I know how Baiano story ends, but
I don't know how it had started.

357
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,223
He probably got a fucked up childhood.

358
00:24:01,563 --> 00:24:03,736
He could have had no option!

359
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,462
- I've noticed it's snowing on the mountain!
Things are goo up here...

360
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,835
- Hey, "galego" (white guy),
"what worths" (what's up)?

361
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:13,020
- This worths!

362
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,363
- Xaveco, "bring two"!

363
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:19,860
What fucks me up is guy who borns with
all chances and throws them all away.

364
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:27,270
I have said it before, but to me, who
helps drug dealers is their abetter.

365
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:29,684
Got to be arrested.

366
00:24:35,132 --> 00:24:38,316
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, Bruno, are you ok?

367
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:56,633
- Hi Paty!

368
00:24:57,273 --> 00:24:58,696
- Excuse me...

369
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:01,339
- Just a minute, bro.

370
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:05,115
- Come on in.

371
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:07,739
- That's it.

372
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:09,211
- On hands.

373
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,905
- Only two?

374
00:25:12,235 --> 00:25:15,660
- Do you think it's easy
to take it with no money?

375
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,842
- So you can bring me more!

376
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,837
- Check this out. There's R$2000,00 here.

377
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:23,071
- Keep it.

378
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:27,767
- If there is more of this one, you
bring me more. People are calling.

379
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm wondering about how many kids we
lost for each joint a playboy smokes!

380
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:05,892
- You go with your team through
the alley but be very carefull.

381
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:08,456
- 117's entrance is near to the college.

382
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:10,349
- There will be a lot of students.

383
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,131
- I know that!
- I've already said it's not right.

384
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,775
- Nascimento, orders are orders.

385
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:19,131
- Everybody will gather
at the complex's center!

386
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:21,635
- Understood?
- Skull!

387
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:18,136
A strategy is a good one only
if its objective makes sense.

388
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:20,880
Pope operation was a stupid thing.

389
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:26,919
On usual conditions, I would be just
pissed off. But my son would be born soon.

390
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:29,362
I had to really take care.

391
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:31,645
I didn't want to lose everything!

392
00:28:21,862 --> 00:28:25,984
- On the floor, on the floor!

393
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:39,473
- Where's the "vapor"?
(the one who carries the drugs)

394
00:28:39,904 --> 00:28:40,955
- Where's the "vapor"?
- I haven't seen him...

395
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,978
- Every body aligned here.

396
00:28:48,957 --> 00:28:49,768
- Sit there!

397
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:53,854
- I'll ask just one time!

398
00:28:54,224 --> 00:28:55,446
- Who was with the "cargo"?

399
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,901
- Who was with the "cargo"?

400
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:00,673
- Who was with the "cargo"?
- I don't know!

401
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:02,526
- Who was with the "cargo"?
- I'm a student!

402
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:04,569
- Speak it up! - I'm a student!
- Are you what?

403
00:29:08,825 --> 00:29:09,646
- Here!

404
00:29:10,337 --> 00:29:11,950
- Put your face there!

405
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,194
- Do you see this hole?

406
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:17,007
- Who has killed this guy?
- I haven`t seen...

407
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:20,542
- Haven't you seen? You have seen!
Speak it up. Who has killed him?

408
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:21,934
- Speak it up!

409
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:23,134
- You may speak!

410
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:24,134
- Who has killed him?

411
00:29:24,378 --> 00:29:26,340
- It was one of you!

412
00:29:27,011 --> 00:29:28,744
- One of us my cock!

413
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,997
- You have killed this guy!

414
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:34,963
- You fucking fag! It is you
who finance all this shit here!

415
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:37,757
- You fucking piece of
shit pot smoker junk!

416
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:43,996
- We come here to undo
the shit you've done!

417
00:29:47,571 --> 00:29:49,313
- It is you who finance all this shit!

418
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:52,087
- You fucking fag!

419
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:55,252
- Who was with the "cargo"?

420
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,213
- 07, bring the little bad seed!

421
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:04,816
- Let's see it...

422
00:30:09,352 --> 00:30:12,457
- Speak it up. It's now! Point at him!

423
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:16,723
- Point now at who was with "the cargo"!

424
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:21,149
- This one in a jacket?

425
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,225
- It's you, son of a whore.
- It's not me!

426
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:26,777
- What to do with him?
- Take him to station with "the cargo".

427
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,623
- Got lucky, tramp!

428
00:30:31,344 --> 00:30:33,327
- I'm not kidding at this shit!

429
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:53,165
- Well, teacher. We've concluded that
the law works like a web on Brasil

430
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:56,680
wich creates many repressive structures.

431
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,984
- Unfortunately on our country

432
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:03,460
it results on a State that

433
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,434
protects rich people and punishes

434
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,529
almost exclusively the poor people!

435
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:13,404
- All right!

436
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:16,349
- I think Maria and her group

437
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:19,593
said clearly how power relations,

438
00:31:19,763 --> 00:31:21,806
and not just the State,

439
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:24,030
create evil institutions.

440
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,394
- We could now make a case analysis.

441
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,619
- can someone give me an example
of one of those institutions?

442
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,471
They kill "fogueteiros"
who breaks down!

443
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,394
And I knew that!

444
00:35:23,944 --> 00:35:25,767
"Fogueteiro"'s mother made
me feel really sorry!

445
00:35:26,078 --> 00:35:28,842
And it's a very dangerous
feeling for a BOPE captain.

446
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:36,713
I realized Rosana was rigth.

447
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,647
It was time to put
someone to replace me.

448
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:14,764
Neto had the police in his heart!

449
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:17,335
He wanted to solve all the problems

450
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,132
But a simpleton guy
can't be a BOPE officer.

451
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:24,466
Neto needed to know that to be
a serious cop on Rio de Janeiro

452
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:26,070
is not easy!

453
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:12,586
You got to stop "punching knifes" (to do
something that will not bring any result).

454
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:15,772
To effectively do something,
you ought to use the system.

455
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:20,849
PM Barracks had been abandoned by
the defense secretary politics.

456
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,557
With no corruption, with no "brazilian
way", military police would stop.

457
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:44,042
The first time is always
for a good reason!

458
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,779
Well, if you corrupt yourself for the police
you will certainly do it for your family!

459
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,082
It's the System's logic!

460
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:54,868
It is why when someone wants a police
car pattroling his store region

461
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:57,271
He got to pay for it.

462
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,084
Police job is to protect, isn't it?

463
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:37,068
System turned it into a business.

464
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,684
But someone who puts a price to
do what he's already paid to do

465
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:46,565
also puts a price to do a "thick sight"
(to pretend not to see when a law is being broken.)

466
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,693
- Ademar is battalion's friend.

467
00:40:07,933 --> 00:40:09,816
- Don't take it bad. I'm following orders.

468
00:40:09,986 --> 00:40:11,538
- Whose orders?

469
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,731
- Bira's.

470
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:17,046
- What Bira?

471
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,311
The System takes all spaces.

472
00:40:21,773 --> 00:40:25,318
Government was so fucked up that it
hadn't have money to buy some tows.

473
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:28,542
So they gave the job to a third company
and started to pay to them to tow.

474
00:40:29,223 --> 00:40:30,926
The System took its advantages.

475
00:40:32,488 --> 00:40:36,033
Each captain took a tow
and started to tow them all.

476
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:57,594
- Colone, it's Fábio making
a mess on our tow scheme!

477
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,587
- You cut his little wings!

478
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:02,742
- Go home! It's my area now!

479
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:04,434
- Now is it you who controls this area?

480
00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:06,878
- I am incontrol of this shit!

481
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:09,231
- Ask him about my parts!

482
00:41:09,982 --> 00:41:12,245
- Hello... son of a
bitch hanged on my face.

483
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:14,799
- What abou my parts?

484
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,625


485
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:22,630


486
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:24,533
- Isn't that commandant's bike?

487
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,057
- Friday! Commandant's bike
goes collect "bicho" "arrego"!

488
00:41:27,307 --> 00:41:30,892
- That's why it can't stop.
To collect "bicho" "arrego"!

489
00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:32,895
- Fuck! Now I understand this shit.

490
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:36,051
- They used to share the money. But
now it is just for commandant's men.

491
00:41:36,054 --> 00:41:39,444
The System got no limits.
The System got no borders.

492
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:42,959
It is a part of the police culture.

493
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:44,792
- This commandant is
fucking with everybody!

494
00:41:45,223 --> 00:41:46,224
- You too?

495
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,370
- Sgt, since last tear I'm on
the scale to take my vacation

496
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:53,395
- Now my wife finaly got
permission to take her vacation

497
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:56,539
- So we're going to take our
vacation together next month!

498
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,684
- I just want to ask you to
report it on the "boletim"

499
00:41:59,904 --> 00:42:00,985
- So I can take my vacation.

500
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:07,305
- It is not easy like this. I
got 40 people still waiting here, 

501
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:10,770
eight already on vacation and the
Battalion cannot lose another man.

502
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,632
- but... who knows if

503
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:16,989
I could talk to the major, tell him
your story and see what happens...

504
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:19,973
- Because we got a good procedure here

505
00:42:20,153 --> 00:42:22,386
- But sgt! Sgt Rocha...

506
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:25,170
- What I'm asking is my rigth.
I don't take any vacation

507
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,874
for far four years! You just
write it down on the "boletim".

508
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:30,027
- I really could help you...

509
00:42:30,228 --> 00:42:32,421
- I mean, I will help you!
- I want to help you!

510
00:42:32,621 --> 00:42:36,125
- But you got to help me to
help you, you know what I mean?

511
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:41,273
- Soldier Paulo, one
who wants to laugh,

512
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:44,608
oughts to make laugh first!

513
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,442
- Oughts to make laugh first!

514
00:42:48,474 --> 00:42:52,690
- Understood, sir.
Asking permission to go!

515
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,913
- Permission given, soldier.

516
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:06,990
- I know nothing about cars, sir!

517
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:09,374
- Couldn't you send me to
the "favelas" operation?

518
00:43:09,744 --> 00:43:11,807
- You have just arrived and already
wants to change your function?

519
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:14,661
- I don't want to change my function!
I want to really help!

520
00:43:15,032 --> 00:43:16,244
- I'm a good shooter!

521
00:43:16,544 --> 00:43:20,770
- Well, if you fix 70% of
those cars on the workshop

522
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,464
- I will think about
your demand! All right?

523
00:43:24,265 --> 00:43:25,988
- But sir, I...
- Dismissed!

524
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:28,551
The System drive the cops crazy.

525
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:33,238
And that's not different on BOPE.

526
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:36,984
- What's up, dear, are
you climbing or what?

527
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,707
- Are you all right, my love?

528
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:42,081
- Are you feeling ok?

529
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:47,729
- Beto?

530
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:56,231
- Beto?

531
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,324
- Are you ok?

532
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:00,818
- I'm ok!

533
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:03,772
- Are you really ok?

534
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:12,665
- Fuck, I'm so sick!

535
00:44:12,865 --> 00:44:14,387
- Stay calm!

536
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,761
- It's not the heart!

537
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,475
- Stay calm, it's not the heart!
- My arm is badly hurting...

538
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,037
- Trust me, it's stress!

539
00:44:28,658 --> 00:44:30,851
- Nascimento, your exams are perfect!

540
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:32,914
- Check this out again!

541
00:44:33,094 --> 00:44:35,468
- They are just perfect!
- There's a lot of heart issues on my family!

542
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:37,491
- My father died with a heart failure...

543
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:40,385
- Your heart is iron made

544
00:44:40,815 --> 00:44:44,751
- Sometimes it begins
with a noise on my ear.

545
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:47,715
- Hand starts to tremble...

546
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:50,109
- It is an emocional problem...

547
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:51,981
- What's that?

548
00:44:52,803 --> 00:44:55,536
- You are feeling stress...

549
00:44:55,707 --> 00:44:58,190
- I'll take you to the shrink!

550
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:01,505
- What the fuck?

551
00:45:01,795 --> 00:45:03,318
- It doesn't hurt, man...

552
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:06,102
If you work correctly on police
you will certainly be fucked up

553
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:07,273
By one way or another.

554
00:45:08,896 --> 00:45:13,853
Matias worked two months to do the city
crime map with that stack of papers.

555
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:16,216


556
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:17,638


557
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:20,092


558
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,192
But it's not the way police works.

559
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:34,212
Police works for the System and it
doesn't work to solve society issues

560
00:45:34,552 --> 00:45:38,809
It works to solve its own problems.

561
00:45:40,091 --> 00:45:41,703
- Fuck, Stêvão, this
report will fuck me up!

562
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:43,686
- 12 corpses in a month!

563
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:45,719
- How can I report this?

564
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,972
- Well, I have followed his work

565
00:45:48,172 --> 00:45:49,434
- and it seems it's correct!

566
00:45:49,694 --> 00:45:51,767
- Are you sure this report...
- Do you want to fuck with me?

567
00:45:52,238 --> 00:45:52,729
- No, sir!

568
00:45:52,991 --> 00:45:55,022
- You go call cpt. Fábio here!
Come on son, go , go!

569
00:45:57,846 --> 00:46:00,189
- He will explain me about
these four corpses on Tabajara.

570
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,404
- Colonel, this report has statistics
base, look at the crime map and...

571
00:46:03,634 --> 00:46:07,640
- Do I want to know about numbers? This
bastard wants to teach me where to put my men!

572
378
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:12,307
When it occurs a crime on the battalion
area, the responsible got to do something.

573
00:46:13,028 --> 00:46:15,051
But to do something means
a lot of work sometimes...

574
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:18,235
- 

575
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:22,572
- A lot! I want to know what does it
mean these four corpses on Tabajara?

576
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:25,686
- It is not may fault. I've done
exactly what you told me to do, but...

577
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,793
- Maré-zero, negative on corpse
localization on Maré-19 area!

578
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:34,769
- The corpses, according informations,
had been localized on Maré-2 area!

579
00:46:36,132 --> 00:46:38,885
It's much easier to move
corpses than to find criminals.

580
00:46:39,686 --> 00:46:45,074
There are a lot of lazy commandats that
move the corpses to another commandat'a area.

581
00:46:45,915 --> 00:46:48,579
But even on PM, you cannot be a simpleton.

582
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,493
- Maré-zero, the corpses are
localized on Maré-19, copy that?

583
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:56,951
- Those sons of whores, colonel.
They keep throwing the corpses here!

584
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,603
- They throw here, I throw there!

585
00:46:58,954 --> 00:47:01,598
- They throw here, I throw there!
- I want this shit done!

586
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:03,300
- But colonel...
- Understood?

587
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:05,884
- yes, sir.
- And you will remake this report!

588
00:47:06,635 --> 00:47:08,968
- Look at this! A corpse
found on the beach.

589
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:11,973
- Death on the beach,
son, is a drowning!

590
00:47:12,503 --> 00:47:13,615
- But commandant, it was perforated...

591
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:16,199
- Are you a legal doctor?
- No, sir.

592
00:47:16,629 --> 00:47:19,373
- I want a new report on my desk
on Monday because this one...

593
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:21,987
- had never existed!

594
00:47:22,087 --> 00:47:24,711
- Dismissed!

595
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,235
I have tryed to change the
convencional police too.

596
00:47:27,665 --> 00:47:30,129
But my plans also have failed.

597
00:47:36,638 --> 00:47:39,122
- If you say nothing it will
be very difficult to help!

598
00:47:39,342 --> 00:47:41,976
- I know, but, it is...

599
00:47:42,647 --> 00:47:44,590
...it's complicated to talk!

600
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:48,695
- More than usual because I'm
not sure if you have to report

601
00:47:49,086 --> 00:47:53,432
what I would tell you to the commandant!

602
00:47:54,554 --> 00:47:57,458
If you have to, I would
prefer to tell you

603
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,294
about a friend of mine
who is going to be dad and 

604
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:03,917
is getting some trouble!
- Captain!

605
00:48:04,188 --> 00:48:06,812
- I can answer your question only

606
230
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:09,986
if you tell me what's going on!

607
00:48:10,277 --> 00:48:12,410
- Besides, it's not a confessionary.

608
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:15,133
- It is the Military Police shrink office!

609
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:19,530
- Come on captain! Have
you already wondered if

610
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,875
I had to report everything
I hear in this office?

611
00:48:23,566 --> 00:48:25,368
- Police would stop on Rio!

612
00:48:27,692 --> 00:48:30,456
- You simply decide

613
00:48:31,026 --> 00:48:32,428
if you want to talk!

614
00:48:44,436 --> 00:48:45,768
- Excuse me.

615
00:48:46,428 --> 00:48:48,832
- Nascimento. I will find
a substitute when I can!

616
00:48:49,223 --> 00:48:51,205
- But colonel...

617
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:54,039
- Captain, I need you
on the Pope's operation!

618
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,227
- Mission accepted is
mission accomplished to me!

619
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:01,821
- Do you understand?

620
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:04,945
- Yes, sir!
- You can go!

621
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:14,539
It was ironic. The same day I lost hope
of quitting BOPE, another story began.

622
76
00:49:15,741 --> 00:49:17,593
A story that would affect many
people. Nicely and badly too.

623
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:29,771
- Hey Neto!
- Too long...

624
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:33,206
- Are you with my car keys?
- What are you doing with the city crime map?

625
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:36,741
- I've figured it out how to
get out of that workshop!

626
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:39,945
- Come with me, I had to explain
the plan to Fábio. Come with me!

627
00:49:40,556 --> 00:49:43,481
- What plan! What the fuck is
this guy talking about...

628
00:49:43,801 --> 00:49:44,702
Fucking crazy...

629
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:49,830
... that workshop smells shit!
... to much work...

630
00:49:50,661 --> 00:49:52,594
- You two complain too much!

631
00:49:52,854 --> 00:49:54,817
- It is me who is getting fucked by
that commandant on the battalion!

632
00:49:55,057 --> 00:49:57,631
- What do you mean, Fábio?
- He took away my schemes, Matias.

633
00:49:57,841 --> 00:50:00,966
I don't have any money, buddy!
I'm fucked up and with no money!

634
00:50:01,176 --> 00:50:04,070
- Look at Oliveira there, 
that son of a whore.

635
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:06,494
- Do you use to take money from here too?

636
00:50:06,554 --> 00:50:09,027
- Come on Neto, I got family!
I get R$500,00 per month

637
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:12,542
from my salary on the police!
Do you think I'll take the chances

638
00:50:13,073 --> 00:50:16,929
to take a bullet in the head
for R$500,00 per month, buddy?

639
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:20,424
- How did you get money from here?
- They were honest schemes!

640
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:24,409


641
00:50:26,172 --> 00:50:28,655


642
00:50:29,717 --> 00:50:32,020


643
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:35,005
- Do you think he does something for free?
He goes there to collect the dealers' "arrego"!

644
00:50:35,355 --> 00:50:37,468
- How muck he uses to take
on the "bicho"'s "arrego"?

645
00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:40,563
- About R$6000,00 per week on my time!
It might be more by this time!

646
00:50:40,873 --> 00:50:44,498
- R$6000,00 per week?
- It's too much money!

647
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:47,222
- I'm working on a scheme
for us to take this money!

648
00:50:47,553 --> 00:50:50,076
- Wich scheme? And how
much do I get from it?

649
00:50:50,337 --> 00:50:52,510
- How much do you what?
- How much do I get?

650
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,005
- Are you going to keep
all of the money for you?
- We don't want any money!

651
00:50:56,315 --> 00:51:00,091
- I'm going to buy the
parts for the police cars!

652
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:03,265
I'll fix them all and get out of that shit!
- I understand it, I just want to know

653
00:51:03,576 --> 00:51:06,430
how much do I get. Just it!
- Don't you want to fuck colonel up?

654
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,514
- I think you are trying to fuck me up!
Do you know what? I'm going to piss

655
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:12,408
I'm going to urinate! What the fuck...

656
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:14,832
- What's wrong?

657
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:16,915
- What's wrong?

658
00:51:17,195 --> 00:51:19,489
- Don't fail on me with this shit!

659
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:22,813
- Look at me, bro!

660
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:31,896
It's true that Neto's plan "washed
the souls" of all honest policemen.

661
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:36,873
It was all on the plan. Matias would take 40
minutes to collect "Jogo do Bicho"'s money.

662
00:51:37,645 --> 00:51:39,307
The greatest "arrego" on the city.

663
00:51:40,989 --> 00:51:42,261
And there is where Neto starts.

664
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:43,944
- Give it a charge,
let's see if it works

665
00:51:44,174 --> 00:51:46,517
- I'm so fucking late...
- Leave it to me!

666
00:51:46,818 --> 00:51:50,143
- If commandant sees me
here I'll get fucked!

667
00:51:50,463 --> 00:51:52,706
- "Do you want easyness?
'Eat water' upside down!"

668
00:51:52,927 --> 00:51:54,930
- Sucker...
- It will work now!

669
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,393
- Will it?
- It will!

670
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,137
- Will it?
- I should be on the street now, Tião!

671
00:52:00,457 --> 00:52:01,609
- Come on.

672
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,795
- Call Paulo at once,
let's fix it quickly!

673
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:17,933
When Neto has released the bike,
Matias has already taken the money.

674
00:52:18,814 --> 00:52:21,057
- Big Sardinha! This is the man!

675
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:23,350
- What's up, Santos? Did you get better?

676
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:25,083
- Better of what?

677
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:27,506
- A buddy of yours came here,
he said you were fucked up!

678
00:52:27,717 --> 00:52:28,968
- Me? Fucked up?

679
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:30,611
- Yeah. I have already
gave him the money!

680
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:32,594
- What buddy, Sardinha?

681
00:52:32,754 --> 00:52:36,389
- A fellow of yours came here in the
name of captain! I gave him the money!

682
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,604
Fucking mother fucker,
what a big son of a whore!

683
00:52:40,765 --> 00:52:45,352
It was genius.

684
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:50,379
Neto used the System against itself.

685
00:52:51,971 --> 00:52:54,295
It was a brilliant idea
but also very stupid.

686
00:52:54,515 --> 00:52:56,098
- More 10 cars ont the streets now, Matias!

687
00:52:57,089 --> 00:52:58,721
There would be a payback.

688
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:02,286
Neto did it to try to fix things.

689
00:53:02,807 --> 00:53:04,700
Matias was "insisting with the mistake".

690
00:53:08,205 --> 00:53:10,148
- I got things to do!
- I'm going with him.

691
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:11,900
- Ok, bye!
- See you!

692
00:53:19,802 --> 00:53:21,564
- Hey, where have you been?
- Hi...

693
00:53:45,338 --> 00:53:48,182


694
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:51,527
- Look at who's comming there!

695
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,972
- Hide the weed!

696
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:56,905
- Unbelieveable!
- What's up, guys?

697
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,753
- All Hail Mary!!!
- Where have you been?

698
00:54:04,746 --> 00:54:06,889
- We were talking, we spaced in the time!

699
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,184
- You're so beautiful!

700
00:54:10,805 --> 00:54:12,918
- Are you going to be sitted there?

701
00:54:13,339 --> 00:54:15,682
- Let's dance we two!

702
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:18,416
- Ok, I'm going to dance. See you!

703
00:54:23,523 --> 00:54:26,558
- Is it just because we got
an apartment on Leblon?

704
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,363
- Check it out! I'll make a mess
with this son of a bitch!

705
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,277
- You don't get any trouble, ok?

706
00:55:04,292 --> 00:55:06,996
- Check this out! They
want to get me mad!

707
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,718
- Leave it away!

708
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:10,381
- Don't worry!

709
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,093
- Let's keep dancing!

710
00:55:33,424 --> 00:55:35,066
- You put more potatles on it!

711
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,983
The System protects corrpted cops.

712
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:44,249
Colonel couldn't complain
about the robbery.

713
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,892
But he could take a revenge.

714
00:55:46,683 --> 00:55:47,965
Matias went to the kitchen.

715
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:50,789
Neto fixed the cars but he
was still at the workshop.

716
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,511
- What are you doing here, Paulo?

717
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:54,394
- Taking my vacation, lieutenant!

718
00:55:54,614 --> 00:55:56,627
- And learning to never
complain about that sgt.

719
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,099
- What about the workshop?

720
00:55:58,269 --> 00:55:59,521
- Well, it gots Tião!

721
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:01,624
And they lost their best mechanic.

722
00:56:04,629 --> 00:56:06,451
- I told you this shit
would get fucked up!

723
00:56:08,314 --> 00:56:11,378
They were lucky because colonel thought
they were just following someone's orders.

724
00:56:11,558 --> 00:56:15,604
Someone who already knew the System.

725
00:56:15,765 --> 00:56:17,617
- Fábio! Come here!

726
00:56:18,348 --> 00:56:19,800
- Are you on dutty tonight?
- yes, sir!

727
00:56:20,061 --> 00:56:23,956
- I want you to go to check out an
occurence at Babilônia hill tonight!

728
00:56:24,197 --> 00:56:26,109
- Me, sir? - Yeah!
- Yes, sir! Tonight?

729
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,723
- Tonight! - As you want, sir!
- Dismissed!

730
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:33,099
The punishment to him would be much worst.

731
00:56:34,632 --> 00:56:38,367
And there's where Matia's and Neto's
story starts to be a part of my story.

732
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,665
- You can see he's moving, love.

733
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,665
- He looks like an E.T., but it's
the most beautiful thing in the world!

734
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:53,279
- I miss you so much here...

735
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:56,373
... wait, I'll put his
heart sound on the phone!

736
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:04,705
Every time I thought about my son
I recall "fogueteiro"'s mother.

737
00:57:07,819 --> 00:57:09,812
It's totally fucked up to be
unable to bury your own son.

738
00:57:27,918 --> 00:57:29,481
- You guys get ready!
We're moving out!

739
00:57:31,423 --> 00:57:32,285
- Where are we going to, my captain?

740
00:57:32,535 --> 00:57:33,496
- We're going to Turano hill!

741
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,359
- We're going to get that "fogueteiro"!

742
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:43,981
- Hey, guys,  colonel asked me to
check out a funk party occurence tonight

743
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:45,954
The hill is nice tonight, even sweet...

744
00:57:46,705 --> 00:57:49,610
If we do everything right, we can
make some money, but Neto cannot know!

745
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:51,753
- All right, captain!
- I'm ready!

746
00:57:52,183 --> 00:57:54,477
- What the fuck are you
doing with this rifle?

747
00:57:54,717 --> 00:57:56,990
Don't fuck everything up
there, for the sake of God !

748
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,514
- It's all rigth, captain, trust me!
- I'm in charge here!

749
00:57:59,884 --> 00:58:01,086
- It's all right, no problem!

750
00:58:01,276 --> 00:58:03,840
- Hey, captain! Cabral is already
in charge of this "Patamo"!

751
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,492
- Colonel asked me to go in it!

752
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:09,959
- No, no! You go with me on my "Patamo"!
You drop this rifle and go fix colonel's bike!

753
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:11,601
- Let's go!

754
00:58:14,295 --> 00:58:16,208
- Neto? Did you take "bicho"'s "arrego"?

755
00:58:16,418 --> 00:58:17,680
- Yes, we did, sir!

756
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,155
- Let's go, captain!
- I'm comming!

757
00:58:22,267 --> 00:58:24,209
- I think they will "fry" me, Neto!

758
00:58:40,363 --> 00:58:42,295
- Matias! It got fucked up!

759
00:58:42,516 --> 00:58:43,547
- What happened?

760
00:58:43,747 --> 00:58:45,250
- They think Fábio took the money!

761
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:47,453
- Come with me!
- What are we going to do?

762
00:58:48,154 --> 00:58:49,295
- "Hold it for me"!

763
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:16,501
- What the fuck?

764
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,282
- What the fuck! Worms are going crazy!

765
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,315
- They are shooting each other!

766
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:04,970
- Fuck!

767
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:08,144
- Shooting my dick, you sick fuck!
You cover me, motherfucker!

768
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:09,707
- Shoot these fuckers!

769
01:01:10,218 --> 01:01:12,001
- You do something!
- I got just one bullet!

770
01:01:12,521 --> 01:01:14,094
... just one bullet, fuck!

771
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:18,719
- This shit is out of area!

772
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:22,265
- Leave a message, captain, leave a message!
- Go fuck yourself, you piece of shit!

773
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,224
- It is an honor to support
you on next elections...

774
01:01:28,775 --> 01:01:31,328
...but if Cabral here got promoted,
it is another battalion!

775
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,542
- Things would be pretty better!

776
01:01:34,213 --> 01:01:35,805
- How much better?

777
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:37,597
- Just a minute, please!

778
01:01:40,532 --> 01:01:41,473
- What's up, Oliveira?

779
01:01:42,785 --> 01:01:44,267
- Colonel, call BOPE...
- What?

780
01:01:44,678 --> 01:01:48,453
- There are surrounded cops on Babilônia hill!
It may be wounded cops on the area!

781
01:01:48,944 --> 01:01:51,257
- All teams are on Turano hill!

782
01:01:51,748 --> 01:01:53,190
- So, what do I do?
- What the fuck...

783
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:11,636
- Nobody here is in a rush, son!
I can spend all nigth here...

784
01:02:12,558 --> 01:02:13,960
- Where's the "fogueteiro"?

785
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,684
- I don't know, boss...
- What don't you know?

786
01:02:17,044 --> 01:02:19,858
- You are sitting there, with a pistol
in your hands! What don't you know?

787
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,151
- I'm not a "vapor", boss, I don't know!

788
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,804
- You are going back to the bag!

789
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:37,163
- He passed out!
- Throw water on is face...

790
01:02:38,575 --> 01:02:39,737
- Wake up, you sick fuck!

791
01:02:40,097 --> 01:02:43,122
- 01, priority on Babilônia
hill, surrounded cops, sir!

792
01:02:45,936 --> 01:02:47,918
- Understood, Carvalho! We're comming!

793
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:50,843
- Fuck, they do the shit we got to
clean it up! Let's go to Babilônia!

794
01:02:51,624 --> 01:02:54,328
- What to do with this worm, captain?
- Put it on the Pope's account!

795
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:57,242
- Turn to the wall, you worm!
- I'm just a...

796
01:03:08,308 --> 01:03:09,530
- We're going to die, man!

797
01:03:10,431 --> 01:03:11,683


798
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:14,316


799
01:03:14,717 --> 01:03:16,680


800
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:19,564
- They are shhoting us from down there!

801
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:21,687
- From down there they will
not hurt us! Stay down!

802
01:03:25,122 --> 01:03:26,514


803
01:03:46,393 --> 01:03:47,745


804
01:03:48,165 --> 01:03:50,839


805
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,032


806
01:03:53,453 --> 01:03:54,755


807
01:03:55,746 --> 01:03:57,418
- Shoot, you son of a whore!

808
01:04:01,044 --> 01:04:02,976
- We're going to die, Neto!
- To die my balls, shoot these suckers!

809
01:04:03,457 --> 01:04:05,540
- Shoot these motherfuckers!

810
01:04:06,171 --> 01:04:07,102
- I'm out of ammo!
- Stay quiet!

811
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:08,835
- Stay down!

812
01:04:10,587 --> 01:04:12,009
- Shoot them, fuck!

813
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:13,912
- Drop the weapon!
- "PM", "PM"! (Military Police)

814
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:01,701
- Drop the weapon!
- "PM", "PM"! (Military Police)

815
01:05:03,293 --> 01:05:05,897
- Drop the weapon!
- "PM", "PM"! (Military Police)

816
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,303
- There are two of us...
- Out of this hole!

817
01:05:12,396 --> 01:05:14,109
- Sit there, come on!

818
01:05:14,589 --> 01:05:15,791
- Sit there, sit there!

819
01:05:16,873 --> 01:05:19,096
- 01, 19 have founded these two!

820
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:24,303
- Hey, Bocão, identify this one here!

821
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:26,777
- This is Marcinho, the hill owner!

822
01:05:27,147 --> 01:05:28,880
- Let's take him with us!
- Are you ok? - Yes sir!

823
01:05:30,142 --> 01:05:31,424
- Is anyone of you hurt?
- No, sir!

824
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,047
- Have anyone of you got shot?
- No, sir!

825
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,831
- So today you're going to
learn how to carry a corpse!

826
01:05:37,572 --> 01:05:40,306
- What are you waiting for?
- Let's go, let's go!

827
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:04,902
- 02?
- Speak it up, 01!

828
01:06:05,072 --> 01:06:08,026
- Now you're in charge!
Let's take just the owner

829
01:06:08,337 --> 01:06:10,099
- Because my son is about to be born!

830
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:17,710
- Let's go, let's go!

831
01:06:18,211 --> 01:06:20,554
- Take him, come on!

832
01:06:25,311 --> 01:06:27,805
Neto decided to join BOPE
because he enjoyed war.

833
01:06:28,886 --> 01:06:31,350
His dream was to fight the
crime on Rio's "favelas".

834
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:33,643
And he saw it was exactly
what we use to do!

835
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:38,600
Matias came with him 
because he believed in law.

836
01:06:43,848 --> 01:06:45,931
- Wait, this shit is hurting so badly!

837
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:49,256
- If you don't come here, I
would be "fried" at this time !

838
01:06:49,616 --> 01:06:51,479
- BOPE took your weapon!

839
01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:53,742
- Help us to carry the body!

840
01:06:55,775 --> 01:06:57,057
- Wait a minute, my friend...

841
01:06:58,339 --> 01:07:00,101
- What the fuck? Get out of here

842
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:01,984
with this shit, you sucker!

843
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:05,509
- Sgt. Excuse me,

844
01:07:05,799 --> 01:07:07,812
but how can I know this unit of yours?

845
01:07:08,203 --> 01:07:10,136
- You just do your
inscription on the trainning!

846
01:07:10,446 --> 01:07:13,220
- What trainning?
- It's on the "PM" oficial paper!

847
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:17,085
Neto knew what he was doing.
Matias did not.

848
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:38,166
- Colonel?
- Rest!

849
01:07:39,408 --> 01:07:40,539
- Sorry, I'm late!
- No problem!

850
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:43,413
- You tell me something...

851
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:45,637
- Is it a boy or a girl?

852
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:48,080
- It's a boy, Rafael!
- Congratulations!

853
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:50,574
- What is that, Renam?
- It is a sor eye!

854
01:07:50,824 --> 01:07:52,456
- What a fucking ugly thing...

855
01:07:52,747 --> 01:07:54,219
- Put these glasses on!

856
01:07:55,341 --> 01:07:57,023
- You pay attention. This is a gift!

857
01:07:57,353 --> 01:07:58,475
- But it is not for you!

858
01:07:58,725 --> 01:08:00,478
- It is for Rafael!

859
01:08:00,818 --> 01:08:04,474
- From here we'll pick two names
that will replace you and you!

860
01:08:07,067 --> 01:08:08,910
- Saint Rafael!
- Colonel, I will coordinate

861
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:13,747
the best trainning you ever
saw on Special Operations!

862
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:16,701
- Ok, let's start with this.
This 01 here,

863
01:08:17,382 --> 01:08:19,806
- André Pedrosa!
- This one is on the "bicho"'s list!

864
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,179
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely sure!

865
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:25,714
- He will become statistics!
- Colonel, Orlavo Carvelli, on my class!

866
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:28,959
- What about him?
- Criminal! He's at the gamble business!

867
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:32,364
- He will become skull candy!
- We have skipped this Fábio!

868
01:08:33,415 --> 01:08:35,939
- I have heard about this Fábio!
Cpt. Fábio Barbosa, isn't it?

869
01:08:36,269 --> 01:08:38,993
- This is a bad one, whore pimp at Copacabana!

870
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:42,518
- Leave him to me!
- Renam? Are you seeing anything there?

871
01:08:42,749 --> 01:08:45,513
- Perfectly, sir!
- He looks like a owl!

872
01:08:45,823 --> 01:08:47,816
- Blinded Skull!
- Batman! - It's beautiful, isn't it?

873
01:08:48,126 --> 01:08:50,280
- Come on, let's go!
- Renam, what about those privates?

874
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:52,603
- They are those who have been
rescueded by your team on the hill!

875
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:55,217
- Colonel Estêvão said they are great!
- Oh, yeah?

876
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:58,051
- They had a nice beggining!
- Now, I'll tell you something!

877
01:08:58,261 --> 01:09:01,075
- I don't want to know about
pierced spandrel on the first class!

878
01:09:01,355 --> 01:09:05,201
- I don't want to know about cutted hands!
Is it clear?

879
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:08,155
- About the cutted hands, it was an accident!

880
01:09:08,476 --> 01:09:11,600
- The student had grabbed the blade
and the instructor had pulled it!

881
01:09:11,851 --> 01:09:14,294
- About that spandrel, Carvalho
gave him a big...

882
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:16,457
- I haven't meant to hurt him!

883
01:09:16,838 --> 01:09:19,672
- Haven't meant it?

884
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:21,715
- He deserved, colonel, he deserved!

885
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:30,127
If you want to be a BOPE officer,
you cannot date dealers' friend.

886
01:09:31,389 --> 01:09:33,231
The truth is that Matias was divided.

887
01:09:34,193 --> 01:09:36,906
He wanted to be a cop, but
he also wanted to be a loyer.

888
01:09:40,281 --> 01:09:44,227
If Matias had a police heart he would
have told her the truth since the begining.

889
01:09:44,908 --> 01:09:46,170
He told her he would travel.

890
01:09:46,741 --> 01:09:48,854
And said nothing when she told him she
could get him a job with her NGO friends.

891
01:09:49,146 --> 01:09:51,488
- He's working with us here
on our NGO for almost one year!

892
01:09:51,768 --> 01:09:55,023
- He is being great to us,
solved all of our problems!

893
01:09:55,503 --> 01:09:57,286
- Ok, but...

894
01:09:57,466 --> 01:10:00,501
...he had to travel and he'll spend two weeks!

895
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:02,734
- Can it be on the week after next week?

896
01:10:03,295 --> 01:10:06,009
- Great!

897
01:10:06,011 --> 01:10:08,522
A divided guy isn't welcome on BOPE.

898
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:11,707
Matias would quit the academy
quickly, I thought at first sight.

899
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:14,020
- I have just achieved that work for Matias!

900
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,243
- It is better for you to
find another boyfriend, Maria!

901
01:10:18,827 --> 01:10:19,898
- What's up, Baiano? Is everything rigth?

902
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:23,023
- You tell me!

903
01:10:25,326 --> 01:10:27,289
- Do you recognize anyone on this picture?

904
01:10:30,584 --> 01:10:32,587
- Aren't you recognizing this piece
of shit boyfriend of yours, are you?

905
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:36,602
- It cannot be...
- Can't it be? This brother he killed...

906
01:10:37,173 --> 01:10:39,437
... was my friend, my comrade!

907
01:10:40,188 --> 01:10:42,511
- Now, what?
- keep it cool, Baiano!

908
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:45,295
- It has nothing to do with you!

909
01:10:45,535 --> 01:10:48,249
- I have brougth him here!
- Maria didn't know that, Baiano!

910
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,833
- I knew nothing about this!
Now I know everything...

911
01:10:51,123 --> 01:10:52,706
- Nobody knew that, Baiano!
- Are you bullshitting me?

912
01:10:53,407 --> 01:10:55,520
- Are you bullshitting me, you fuckers?

913
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,965
- I will tell you what! Here on the
hill, Military Policemen are enemies!

914
01:10:59,525 --> 01:11:01,498
- They are "german" (rival faction)!
- Nobody is bullshitting you...

915
01:11:01,999 --> 01:11:03,862
- Shut up, I haven't finished yet!

916
01:11:04,212 --> 01:11:06,115
- Who are the ones who guarantee
the peace here on the hill?

917
01:11:07,277 --> 01:11:08,358
- You answer me now!

918
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,232
- It is the Command!
- It is the Command, sister!!!

919
01:11:12,264 --> 01:11:14,757
- And the Command is us! And I am the boss!

920
01:11:15,168 --> 01:11:16,760
- To stay here, you ought to join us!

921
01:11:17,301 --> 01:11:18,743
- We have joined...
- Do you join what, playboy?

922
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,706
- Do you join what, playboy?
- It is us, Baiano...

923
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:22,559
- It's us!
- Indeed! it's us!

924
01:11:23,229 --> 01:11:24,451
- It is us, Baiano!

925
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,294
- I'll charge it all!

926
01:11:27,235 --> 01:11:29,008
- You may charge!
- You shut the fucking up!

927
01:11:32,262 --> 01:11:33,915
- Catch him, Xaveco! Son of a whore!

928
01:11:35,697 --> 01:11:36,669
- Talking must be straight!

929
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,873
- If it's twisted, it is with you, you know?

930
01:11:40,855 --> 01:11:43,338
- Now you study this fucking paper...

931
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:45,141
- Let's go!

932
01:11:55,015 --> 01:11:57,929
When they arrived, a
corrupted cop came with them.

933
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:02,977
If Fábio was not there,
he would get killed by colonel.

934
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,051
Poor guy.

935
01:12:06,401 --> 01:12:09,346
He didn't know that colonel is
a lady in comparison to me.

936
01:12:18,552 --> 01:12:20,932
- You arrived here by your own legs!

937
01:12:21,623 --> 01:12:25,058
- Nobody, absolutely nobody,

938
01:12:25,459 --> 01:12:26,971
had invited you!

939
01:12:27,682 --> 01:12:28,684
- And none of you,

940
01:12:28,954 --> 01:12:31,928
none of you is welcome here!

941
01:12:33,841 --> 01:12:35,563
- Prepare your souls!

942
01:12:36,004 --> 01:12:38,157
- Because your bodies

943
01:12:38,568 --> 01:12:40,210
belong to us already!

944
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:43,535
- I declare open the 9th

945
01:12:43,795 --> 01:12:46,970
Special Operation trainning!

946
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:49,003
- You'll never be!

947
01:12:57,495 --> 01:12:59,788
- Skulls! Forward!

948
01:13:06,538 --> 01:13:09,422
I know it is like some religious shit.

949
01:13:10,514 --> 01:13:11,836
But that's the way it is got to be.

950
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:19,937
Our soldiers got to be tough.

951
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:23,743
A guy must prove he can handle
pressure to become a BOPE officer.

952
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:38,063
- Do you think we don't know you
receive money from drug dealers?

953
01:13:38,324 --> 01:13:41,899
- Do you think we don't know you
receive money from the "bicho"'s gamble?

954
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:44,813
- Do you know why your number is 01?

955
01:13:45,103 --> 01:13:47,357
- It is because you will be
the first one to quit!

956
01:13:47,607 --> 01:13:49,980
- And I'll make you quit!

957
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:52,424
- You ask to quit!

958
01:13:52,684 --> 01:13:53,916
- You ask to quit!

959
01:13:54,457 --> 01:13:56,810
- You ask to quit or else
you'll quit under my punchs!

960
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:59,284
- I quit! I quit! I quit!

961
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,458
- 01 quited!

962
01:14:06,624 --> 01:14:10,209
Only 5 PM in 100 complete the training.

963
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:13,725
When I have trained, buddy, we were 3!

964
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:17,089
Not even "Israel" army trains like we do.

965
01:14:33,423 --> 01:14:36,367
To fight at this war you must
be able to handle anything.

966
01:14:40,503 --> 01:14:41,915
- The strategy concept...

967
01:14:42,366 --> 01:14:45,701
... 'strategia' in Greek,

968
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:49,596
'stratege' in Latin,

969
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:52,651
in French,

970
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,373
'strategie',...

971
01:14:54,874 --> 01:14:56,045
- Are you writting it down?

972
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:58,699
- Yes, sir!
- I'll ask this on the test!

973
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:02,284
... in English, strategy,

974
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:05,219
in Dutch,

975
01:15:05,519 --> 01:15:07,262
'strategia',

976
01:15:08,073 --> 01:15:09,976
in Italian,

977
01:15:10,266 --> 01:15:11,558
'strategia',

978
01:15:12,599 --> 01:15:14,622
in Spanish, 'strategia'...

979
01:15:24,046 --> 01:15:25,528
- Mr. 05?
- Yes, sir!

980
01:15:25,778 --> 01:15:27,210
- Please...

981
01:15:30,645 --> 01:15:33,549
- Mr. 05, if you drop this grenade

982
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,963
you will explode all the class!

983
01:15:36,263 --> 01:15:39,949
- You will explode your friends,
you will explode my assistants,

984
01:15:40,209 --> 01:15:41,861
you will explode me!

985
01:15:42,262 --> 01:15:44,786
- Are you going to sleep, mr. 05?
- No, sir!

986
01:15:45,356 --> 01:15:47,610
- We're all trusting you, mr. 05!

987
01:15:51,245 --> 01:15:52,867
- Let me retake...

988
01:15:53,638 --> 01:15:56,853
... my thinking line!

989
01:15:59,707 --> 01:16:02,631
- The strategy concept,

990
01:16:03,342 --> 01:16:07,258
'strategia' in Greek...

991
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:17,783
- Sheriff?

992
01:16:18,144 --> 01:16:20,427
- Yes, sir!
- Is the class ready to lunch?

993
01:16:20,697 --> 01:16:23,892
- Yes, sir!
- How much time do you want to lunch?

994
01:16:24,242 --> 01:16:25,975
- 10 minutes would be fine, sir!

995
01:16:27,006 --> 01:16:28,769
- Are you fucking with us?

996
01:16:29,009 --> 01:16:31,262
- You are such a braggart, sheriff!

997
01:16:32,644 --> 01:16:35,048
- You will got 10 seconds

998
01:16:35,408 --> 01:16:37,892
to lunch!
- Nobody touchs the food until I say so!

999
01:16:44,031 --> 01:16:48,027
- When you're finished, I want
to see a clean ground here!

1000
01:16:48,677 --> 01:16:50,560
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

1001
01:16:51,652 --> 01:16:52,182
- Go!

1002
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:57,380
- 3 seconds already gone!

1003
01:16:57,811 --> 01:17:00,224
- 02 isn't eating!

1004
01:17:00,715 --> 01:17:03,028
- Your time is over!

1005
01:17:03,509 --> 01:17:04,791
- Time is over, time is over!

1006
01:17:09,527 --> 01:17:11,570
- Can you explain me why this
food here is on the ground?

1007
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:13,293
- There was not enough time, sir!

1008
01:17:13,623 --> 01:17:16,037
- Do you think it's fair,
on a country like Brasil,

1009
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:18,020
where people are starving to death,

1010
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:21,725
mr. 06, you leave this food here on the ground,

1011
01:17:21,985 --> 01:17:24,189
just because you're mourning, mr. 06?
- No, sir!

1012
01:17:24,729 --> 01:17:26,752
- Why didn't you eat, 02?

1013
01:17:26,993 --> 01:17:29,116
- I couldn't reach the food, captain!

1014
01:17:29,336 --> 01:17:31,469
- Can you reach the food now, mr. 02?

1015
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:33,001
- Yes, sir!

1016
01:17:33,422 --> 01:17:36,456
- So get down on your knees,
and eat the food now!

1017
01:17:39,811 --> 01:17:42,745
- I want to see you eat all of this food, mr. 02!

1018
01:17:43,266 --> 01:17:44,488
- No mourning, 02!
- Yes, sir!

1019
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:47,963
- If you don't eat all of this food, everybody

1020
01:17:48,253 --> 01:17:50,146
will spend the nigth on the water, mr. 02!

1021
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:54,793
- Ah! Are you getting sick, 06?
(He says 06 instead of 02!)

1022
01:17:55,193 --> 01:17:58,288
- 02, if you vomit on your friends food

1023
01:17:58,568 --> 01:18:01,182
they will have to eat this shit

1024
01:18:01,502 --> 01:18:04,126
with your vomit, because you've vomited!

1025
01:18:04,336 --> 01:18:05,888
- No, sir! I will eat it!

1026
01:18:06,249 --> 01:18:08,472
- Everybody will eat this shit! Now!

1027
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:14,931
- Blame it on 02!
- I want to see a clean ground!

1028
01:18:28,862 --> 01:18:31,325
- Stop the song, stop the song!

1029
01:18:31,826 --> 01:18:32,877
- Sheriff!

1030
01:18:33,298 --> 01:18:36,182
- This is the worst class I
have ever seen on my life!

1031
01:18:36,653 --> 01:18:38,606
- You all keep walking, Sheriff!

1032
01:18:38,816 --> 01:18:40,789
- I said to stop the song,

1033
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:43,763
not to stop the walking!
I want you out of this water!

1034
01:18:45,605 --> 01:18:47,108
The first stage of the trainning
is meant to be violent.

1035
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:49,211
The objective is to make the weak to quit.

1036
01:18:49,721 --> 01:18:51,514
Specially the corrupted cops.

1037
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:56,010
And when I am the instructor,
corrupted cops get fucked first.

1038
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:59,295
- 14, can you borrow me your medicine?
- You borrow him, mine is over!

1039
01:19:01,138 --> 01:19:03,732
- 02, wake up!

1040
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,426
-  Take off your boots!
- Let me sleep...

1041
01:19:06,606 --> 01:19:10,151
I can't! If I take it off I will
not be able to put it on again!

1042
01:19:10,491 --> 01:19:13,866
- Your feet are wet! They will be fucked
up if you don't take off your boots!

1043
01:19:14,177 --> 01:19:16,550
- Your feet will be shit! Take it off!

1044
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,753
- Attention, 02!

1045
01:19:19,144 --> 01:19:21,557
- Mr. 02, I got some news for you!
- Yes, sir!

1046
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:24,702
- You are the new Sheriff, 02!

1047
01:19:26,234 --> 01:19:30,600
- You got one minute to put
everybody on the formation!

1048
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:33,334
- Let's go, let's go!

1049
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:46,683
- It has passed one minute and 20 seconds!

1050
01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:48,496
- It has passed one minute and 20 seconds!
- Yes, sir!

1051
01:19:48,746 --> 01:19:50,509
- Is everybody on the formation?
- Yes, sir! - Look behind you!

1052
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:59,131
- Is everybody on the formation?
- Yes, sir! - Are you sure?

1053
01:19:59,612 --> 01:20:01,825
- What about your untied boot?

1054
01:20:02,126 --> 01:20:03,568
- You animal!

1055
01:20:06,862 --> 01:20:08,224
- You piece of shit!

1056
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:12,224
- 02, follow me!
- Yes, sir!

1057
01:20:16,606 --> 01:20:18,709
- Are you seeing that boat?
- Yes, sir!

1058
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:21,674
- Are you seeing that boat?
- Yes, sir!

1059
01:20:21,944 --> 01:20:24,067
- Since you got an untied boot,
you will take off your equipment

1060
01:20:24,308 --> 01:20:26,160
and bring that boat here!
- Yes, sir!

1061
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:30,256
- Do you think you can do that, 02?

1062
01:20:30,567 --> 01:20:32,850
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. 02...

1063
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:36,114
... do you know why you will not achieve?
- Yes, sir!

1064
01:20:37,086 --> 01:20:39,529
- It is not just because you're a weak!

1065
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:43,595
- You will not achieve that because
to have this skull here, mr. 02,

1066
01:20:44,096 --> 01:20:46,079
you ought to got character, mr. 02!

1067
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:49,404
- A thing you don't have!

1068
01:20:49,754 --> 01:20:51,116
- Your place is among whores!

1069
01:20:51,396 --> 01:20:52,989
- Your place is among whore pimps!
- Ys...sr...

1070
01:20:53,309 --> 01:20:55,392
- Your place is on abortion clinics, 02!

1071
01:20:56,844 --> 01:20:59,698
- We don't like corrupted cops here, mr. 02!

1072
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:03,794
- Corrupted cops don't join BOPE, mr. 02!

1073
01:21:05,707 --> 01:21:07,430
- Will you bring me that boat?
- Yes, sir!

1074
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,402
- Will you bring me that boat?
- Yes, sir!

1075
01:21:09,903 --> 01:21:11,936
- So let's see if you'll achieve that!
You all look forward!

1076
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:16,312
- Go away, 02, you're a weak!

1077
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:18,656
- Ask to quit, you'll not achieve that!

1078
01:21:18,956 --> 01:21:22,802
- Ask to quit you piece of shit!

1079
01:21:23,903 --> 01:21:26,477
- I can't handle it anymore, captain!
- I haven't heard, 02!

1080
01:21:26,857 --> 01:21:28,219
- I haven't heard!

1081
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:30,262
- I can't handle it anymore!

1082
01:21:30,563 --> 01:21:32,466
- I quit!
- Louder!

1083
01:21:33,908 --> 01:21:35,961
- For all to hear you're such a weak!

1084
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:37,783
- I quit!

1085
01:21:38,451 --> 01:21:39,783
- You piece of shit!

1086
01:21:42,813 --> 01:21:44,275
- Attention class! Rest!

1087
01:21:47,457 --> 01:21:49,240
- Special Operations!

1088
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,243
- You'll never be!
- Ever! Never!

1089
01:21:52,855 --> 01:21:54,697
- Attention, 12!

1090
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:57,421
- Yes, sir!

1091
01:21:57,812 --> 01:21:59,564
- You are the new Sheriff, 12!

1092
01:22:00,977 --> 01:22:02,809
- Sir, I quit, sir!

1093
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,542
- You piece of shit!

1094
01:22:05,223 --> 01:22:10,070
- You gentlemen are making me very happy!

1095
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:12,773
- Many thanks!

1096
01:22:13,905 --> 01:22:15,938
- Attention, 08!

1097
01:22:35,306 --> 01:22:37,719
When the first stage ended,
there were only 8 of them.

1098
01:22:40,443 --> 01:22:42,206
It was time to choose a substitute.

1099
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:46,932
Matias surprised me.

1100
01:22:47,373 --> 01:22:49,216
He got through the first stage.

1101
01:22:49,997 --> 01:22:52,350
But he had the bad idea
of come back to college.

1102
01:22:53,833 --> 01:22:56,266
- Do you know who told me you're "PM"?

1103
01:22:56,877 --> 01:22:59,451
- What happened?
- The hill owner! Do you understand?

1104
01:23:00,402 --> 01:23:04,608
- Do you got any idea of how much
time I've worked to be on that NGO?

1105
01:23:05,449 --> 01:23:08,293
- How much time I've worked for
all those things to happen?

1106
01:23:08,574 --> 01:23:11,137
- Take it easy, Maria!
- I'll not take it easy!

1107
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:14,192
- You had no right to put
me and my frinds in danger!

1108
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:16,866
- You're not understanding!
I have been threatened!

1109
01:23:17,126 --> 01:23:19,279
- You have putted our lives in danger!
- I couldn't tell you!

1110
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:22,744
- You still cannot tell me anything!
- Let me speak! - I don't believe in you!

1111
01:23:23,024 --> 01:23:26,710
- Do you need to believe to talk to me?
- You are a big son of a whore of a lier!

1112
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:29,093
- That's what you are!
- You listen to me...

1113
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,435
- I will not listen to you anymore!
- Wait a minute...

1114
01:23:38,957 --> 01:23:41,090
- You just tell me if I do something wrong!
- You are doing fine.

1115
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:43,784
- It cannot be open wide!
- It also cannot be very tied!

1116
01:23:46,658 --> 01:23:49,733
To choose a substitute isn't
easy like it seems to be.

1117
01:23:51,606 --> 01:23:53,749
- Is there anyone good on the trainning?
- There's a guy who's pretty good!

1118
01:23:54,219 --> 01:23:56,302
- Are you serious?
- Very good one!

1119
01:23:56,593 --> 01:23:59,217
- He looks like me on my trainning time!

1120
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:01,640
The question wasn't to choose
the best one on the trainning.

1121
01:24:02,261 --> 01:24:06,156
The guy had to... had to do
the job exactly like I do.

1122
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:09,051
I had to be sure before quitting.

1123
01:24:09,782 --> 01:24:13,307
- What a good new!
- In one month I think I can quit!

1124
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,483
If Neto had Matias' brain

1125
01:24:17,993 --> 01:24:19,856
my life would have been easier.

1126
01:24:20,727 --> 01:24:22,460
But who said life's easy?

1127
01:24:23,521 --> 01:24:25,154
- Walking to the target! Fire!

1128
01:24:26,035 --> 01:24:31,673
On the second stage, we teach them
to kill effectivelly and with dignity.

1129
01:24:32,134 --> 01:24:33,646
Believe me. It is possible.

1130
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:35,188
- 

1131
01:24:35,809 --> 01:24:36,871
- Good one, 06! Pattern!

1132
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:39,474
- Shooting with my rifle makes things easier!

1133
01:24:40,236 --> 01:24:40,866
- Skull!

1134
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:44,422
- Now, you four... 23?

1135
01:24:44,732 --> 01:24:46,615
- Aren't you using your "bandoleira"?
(like a belt to carry the weapon)

1136
01:24:47,055 --> 01:24:49,409
- Almost finishing the trainning
and aren't you using it, 23?

1137
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:53,585
- Let's see, your partner falls wounded
and what will you do with this rifle?

1138
01:24:53,925 --> 01:24:55,017
- Will you drop it on the ground?
- No, sir!

1139
01:24:55,628 --> 01:24:57,150
- Will you stick it up your ass?
- No, sir!

1140
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:58,742
- So put the fucking "bandoleira" on!

1141
01:24:59,874 --> 01:25:01,045
- Fuck!

1142
01:25:01,646 --> 01:25:03,189
- 20 years of trainning, fuck!

1143
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:09,768
Only foreign people think all
"favelas" are the same thing.

1144
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:11,911
They are not.

1145
01:25:13,764 --> 01:25:15,386
Some are reachable only by climbing.

1146
01:25:15,957 --> 01:25:17,779
At others it is better to
invade through the jungle.

1147
01:25:20,353 --> 01:25:23,426
- Target at 90 degrees, understood?
- Ok! You may call the squad!

1148
01:25:43,396 --> 01:25:45,379
We don't arrive shooting
when we invade a "favela".

1149
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,921
We invade using strategy.

1150
01:25:47,502 --> 01:25:49,014
We walk alley by alley.

1151
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:51,448
- If you're covered you may go!

1152
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:53,351
- Foccus is ahead!

1153
01:25:54,212 --> 01:25:56,726
- Look ahead! "Close" your face!
It's indeed a bad guy face!

1154
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,202
- If you're covered you may go!

1155
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,537
- Look at me. Now it's slowly, 06!

1156
01:26:05,418 --> 01:26:06,690
- Slowly, easy!

1157
01:26:07,431 --> 01:26:08,723
Progression on a "favela" is an art!

1158
01:26:09,514 --> 01:26:12,738
And you got to be an artist
to become a BOPE captain.

1159
01:26:13,099 --> 01:26:14,501
- "Sliced", got through!

1160
01:26:14,912 --> 01:26:16,905
- Good one, 06, good one my boy! That's it!

1161
01:26:17,996 --> 01:26:19,288
- "Sliced", got through!

1162
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:23,063
We don't admit any operation mistakes
while conducting a "favela" progression.

1163
01:26:28,431 --> 01:26:30,434
- What are you going to do
now? Are you covered? Yes!

1164
01:26:30,905 --> 01:26:34,269
- No rush! It can be a mess out there!
You will do everything nice and easy!

1165
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,883
- Look ahead! Can you go?

1166
01:26:37,314 --> 01:26:38,726
- Then go ahead.

1167
01:26:41,314 --> 01:26:43,726
- That's it, 06! Pattern! That's it!

1168
01:26:44,744 --> 01:26:46,938
Man in a black uniform
enters a "favela" to kill

1169
01:26:49,682 --> 01:26:51,013
never to die.

1170
01:26:58,785 --> 01:27:00,848
My substitute needed to know that!

1171
01:27:04,314 --> 01:27:06,226
- Captain, captain?

1172
01:27:06,314 --> 01:27:08,726
- "Fogueteiro" ran away on that direction!
- Was he alone?

1173
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:11,323
- Is he alone?
- I will catch him!

1174
01:27:11,834 --> 01:27:13,105
- Wait! Wait!
- I'll catch him!

1175
01:27:14,898 --> 01:27:16,070
- Come back! Come bak now you fuck!

1176
01:27:35,898 --> 01:27:37,870
- 06 is going to die, Renam!

1177
01:27:46,343 --> 01:27:47,715
- What happened lieutenant?
- Let's go, let's go!

1178
01:28:01,184 --> 01:28:02,647
- He's up there, Renam, up there!

1179
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,638
- Come back, you fuck! Come back!

1180
01:28:10,989 --> 01:28:13,252
- Come back, come back!

1181
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:16,657
- Come back, come back!

1182
01:28:23,306 --> 01:28:25,550
- Take off this black uniform!

1183
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,873
- Take off this black uniform
that you don't deserve to wear!

1184
01:28:28,253 --> 01:28:30,787
- You are not skull!
You are a fucking kid!

1185
01:28:31,218 --> 01:28:34,332
- Have you heard it?
You are a fucking kid!

1186
01:28:51,196 --> 01:28:52,538
- What medicine is this?

1187
01:28:56,935 --> 01:28:58,237
- This one got no problem!

1188
01:28:58,897 --> 01:29:00,340
- Let me see!
- Everybody takes this one!

1189
01:29:02,402 --> 01:29:03,264
- No problem at all!

1190
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,239
- You will not need to take it anymore!

1191
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,393
- You will quit and this will be over!

1192
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:12,497
- Am I quitting where?

1193
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:14,780
- Where am I going to quit?

1194
01:29:15,251 --> 01:29:17,624
- You are going to quit BOPE,
aren't you?

1195
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:20,438
- What happened?

1196
01:29:24,644 --> 01:29:25,946
- You are going to quit, aren't you?

1197
01:29:26,557 --> 01:29:27,929
- Everything is allright!

1198
01:29:30,473 --> 01:29:31,885
- What happened, tell me!

1199
01:29:32,356 --> 01:29:33,537
- I choosed the wrong guy!

1200
01:29:34,248 --> 01:29:36,301
- What does it mean?

1201
01:29:36,562 --> 01:29:37,914
- I choosed the wrong guy! I got fucked!

1202
01:29:38,324 --> 01:29:41,158
- There was two kids, I choosed one,
Azevedo choosed another! Mine's crazy, so...

1203
01:29:41,389 --> 01:29:42,650
- Why does Azevedo got the priority?

1204
01:29:42,672 --> 01:29:45,294
- You tell colonel that now you got a son...

1205
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:48,088
- Azevedo gots two kids! He gots two kids!

1206
01:29:48,514 --> 01:29:50,088
- Low your voice, your son is sleeping, fuck!

1207
01:29:51,843 --> 01:29:54,607
There was just one thing that pisses
me off more than an operation mistake.

1208
01:29:51,843 --> 01:29:54,607
There was just one thing that pisses
me off more than an operation mistake.

1209
01:29:54,843 --> 01:29:57,607
Do not "turn him off" now, let him
continue! Didn't you tell me he

1210
01:29:57,743 --> 01:30:00,607
was good? You choosed him, the
guy was great! What happened?

1211
01:30:00,886 --> 01:30:03,260
It was Rosana trying
to tell me what to do.

1212
01:30:04,241 --> 01:30:05,253
- When do they graduate?

1213
01:30:08,998 --> 01:30:10,300
- When do they graduate?

1214
01:30:11,752 --> 01:30:13,675
- Everything is going to be ok, my love!

1215
01:30:16,752 --> 01:30:18,675
- Everything is going to be ok, I love you!

1216
01:30:26,443 --> 01:30:27,785
- That's it, brother!
- Is it?

1217
01:30:28,386 --> 01:30:30,018
- Are you sure?

1218
01:30:30,519 --> 01:30:32,732
-Let's do something! Look at these books!

1219
01:30:33,033 --> 01:30:35,236
- We got a beautiful indian here...
- Indian my dick, buddy!

1220
01:30:35,436 --> 01:30:36,858
- Knife on the skull, brother!

1221
01:31:00,092 --> 01:31:03,456
We are "speeded up" when we finish training

1222
01:31:03,817 --> 01:31:05,890
and Neto uses to enjoy some action.

1223
01:31:07,442 --> 01:31:11,067
Since he becomes a BOPE captain he
"falled inside" the Pope operation.

1224
01:31:11,979 --> 01:31:13,711
He wanted to garantee Pope's dreams.

1225
01:31:24,397 --> 01:31:29,163
More than 30 tramps had already
died since he began at Turano hill.

1226
01:31:36,384 --> 01:31:40,159
The training prepares them to war, and
it's bullshit to tell me it's inhumane.

1227
01:31:41,461 --> 01:31:43,294
Rio de Janeiro is a city at war.

1228
01:31:43,674 --> 01:31:45,727
If drug dealers got money to buy weapons

1229
01:31:45,978 --> 01:31:47,109
the war goes on.

1230
01:31:48,621 --> 01:31:50,574
Every BOPE policeman learns that.

1231
01:31:52,908 --> 01:31:53,939
Matias was right.

1232
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:56,573
He had to confront those pot heads.

1233
01:32:00,438 --> 01:32:02,101
- I'm leaving, people. I'm gone, bye!

1234
01:32:03,673 --> 01:32:05,065
- Hey, you, I want to talk to you!
- Take it easy!

1235
01:32:06,738 --> 01:32:09,271
- Keep cool! I will not arrest you now!

1236
01:32:09,471 --> 01:32:10,954
- Who said I'm afraid of it?

1237
01:32:11,524 --> 01:32:12,886
- Then take that smile off of your face!

1238
01:32:16,161 --> 01:32:17,773
- Do you see these glasses?
- I do!

1239
01:32:18,525 --> 01:32:20,547
- It's for Romerito! - Give it to me!
- Take your hands off!

1240
01:32:20,908 --> 01:32:23,402
- You have never payed attention on the kid!

1241
01:32:23,662 --> 01:32:25,344
- I will give them to him!

1242
01:32:25,555 --> 01:32:28,659
- If you show up there you'll get killed!
- I don't walk with junks

1243
01:32:28,889 --> 01:32:30,992
neither with tramps!

1244
01:32:32,845 --> 01:32:35,208
- That's what you're going to do!
You'll settle a meeting

1245
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:39,585
tomorrow at noon on the flip!
I will give them to him!

1246
01:32:39,815 --> 01:32:41,137
- I will not do anything! Ask Maria...

1247
01:32:42,299 --> 01:32:44,572
- Have you lost you danger sense?

1248
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:48,207
- If you don't do this shit for me,
I will arrest you, understood?

1249
01:32:48,618 --> 01:32:51,442
- You fucking shitty little drug dealer!

1250
01:32:51,742 --> 01:32:53,755
- Do you think I don't know you sell it here?

1251
01:32:56,699 --> 01:33:00,184
- Tomorrow noon!

1252
01:33:12,903 --> 01:33:15,827
- I will put platinum on your nose!

1253
01:33:16,498 --> 01:33:18,631
- You're sniffing a lot, hun?
- It is us!

1254
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:22,907
- Xaveco?

1255
01:33:26,362 --> 01:33:28,135
- There's the cargo, "galego"!

1256
01:33:28,475 --> 01:33:29,797
- I won't take anything today, Baiano!

1257
01:33:29,798 --> 01:33:31,059
- Things are "dirty" at the college!

1258
01:33:31,499 --> 01:33:33,502
- What commedy is this?

1259
01:33:33,993 --> 01:33:34,714
- Why is it "dirty"?

1260
01:33:35,025 --> 01:33:37,318
- That "PM" son of whore threatened me!
He said he would arrest me!

1261
01:33:38,419 --> 01:33:41,764
- What's that, boss? "PM"?
- What story is this?

1262
01:33:45,329 --> 01:33:46,641
- What's going on here?

1263
01:33:47,182 --> 01:33:50,527
- It is just this...
- What has he said, brother?

1264
01:33:51,228 --> 01:33:53,111
- What has he told you,
you fucking asshole?

1265
01:33:54,242 --> 01:33:55,774
- Hey, Neto!
- What's up, André?

1266
01:33:56,455 --> 01:33:57,827
- There's a message for you!

1267
01:33:58,218 --> 01:33:59,490
- What message?

1268
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:04,196
- They call from the loyer office!
They settled an interview with you!

1269
01:34:04,437 --> 01:34:08,463
- Tomorrow 10 am. I have confirmed!
- I don't want any favor from Maria anymore!

1270
01:34:08,753 --> 01:34:10,215
- Are you crazy, André?

1271
01:34:10,686 --> 01:34:13,119
- Fuck! That's your opportunity!
That's why you're studying for!

1272
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:15,753
- Take this fucking job, my brother!

1273
01:34:16,274 --> 01:34:20,029
- Come on, playboy, talk that talk!
You don't hesitate. Talk a straight talk!

1274
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:23,825
- That NGO we work at...
- "Your ass NGO my dick", you fuck!

1275
01:34:24,145 --> 01:34:27,881
... so, there's a kid who's a "blind-O"...
- Fuck, it will not work!

1276
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:30,384
- Tomorrow morning I got do
deliver Romerito's glasses!

1277
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:34,219
- That kid has been born blind!
Can't he wait one more day?

1278
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:38,175
- Where will it happen? Talk the talk!
- Fag! - Ok, I'll say everything, ok...

1279
01:34:38,686 --> 01:34:41,670
- He will bring it here!
- No, no, not here...

1280
01:34:42,001 --> 01:34:44,224
- You know it is important to me!

1281
01:34:44,564 --> 01:34:45,506
- You know that!

1282
01:34:46,037 --> 01:34:50,836
- Where have you arranged the meeting?
- It will be at the flip! - What time, fuck?

1283
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:52,836
- Talk your talk, brother!
- It will be at noon, brother!

1284
01:35:03,592 --> 01:35:08,459
Matias told me Neto have insisted 
with him to go to that "job interview".

1285
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,615
But he really wanted to be a loyer.

1286
01:35:17,522 --> 01:35:19,344
I haven't had choosed the wrong substitute.

1287
01:35:26,522 --> 01:35:29,344
- Can I have another coin, uncle?

1288
01:35:29,522 --> 01:35:31,344
- Are you winning or losing?
- Losing...

1289
01:35:31,522 --> 01:35:33,344
- You got to win, kid!

1290
495
01:35:33,522 --> 01:35:35,344
- Give him more coins, Zé!

1291
01:35:47,275 --> 01:35:48,176
- Romerito?

1292
01:35:48,757 --> 01:35:50,279
- Let's go, boss, he arrived!

1293
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:53,512
- Easy, brother! There's a kid there!
Chill out! The guy is surrounded!

1294
01:35:53,744 --> 01:35:55,697
- Are you Romerito?
- Yes, sir!

1295
01:35:56,147 --> 01:35:58,000
- I got a little gift for you!

1296
01:36:00,103 --> 01:36:02,817
- There it goes! Now you can see better!

1297
01:36:03,408 --> 01:36:04,529
- Where is he?

1298
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:06,242
- He's working! Try it out!

1299
01:36:07,344 --> 01:36:10,839
- Wow! - Now you look like a man!
- Stop bugging me!

1300
01:36:12,531 --> 01:36:16,494
- It is better for you to go, uncle...
(some people call 'uncle' even the dogs)

1301
01:36:28,113 --> 01:36:29,706
- Don't shoot! I will
finish this son of whore!

1302
01:36:32,279 --> 01:36:34,102
- What's that?

1303
01:36:34,733 --> 01:36:36,255
- What the fuck is that, brother?

1304
01:36:37,146 --> 01:36:39,019
- Fuck that shit!

1305
01:36:42,474 --> 01:36:45,518
- The son of a whore is a BOPE officer!
Activity, activity! Fuck!

1306
01:36:46,089 --> 01:36:47,471
- Take his body away! Take his body away!

1307
01:36:47,902 --> 01:36:50,215
- He's alive, he's alive!
Stop that car, stop that car!

1308
01:36:51,377 --> 01:36:52,839
- Get out, everybody out of the car!

1309
01:36:55,222 --> 01:36:56,324
- Get out, you fuckers, get out!

1310
01:36:57,185 --> 01:37:00,850
- Look at Lombada! Take Lombada away,
take Lombada away, fuck!

1311
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:02,293
- Take Lombada away, fuck!

1312
01:37:03,264 --> 01:37:05,436
- Put the worm in the car!
Activity, activity, fuck!

1313
01:37:05,948 --> 01:37:08,501
A man who controls a "favela" can
be crazy. But he cannot be stupid.

1314
01:37:08,992 --> 01:37:12,697
Baiano knew that to kill a BOPE officer was
the same of to sign his own death sentence.

1315
01:37:13,649 --> 01:37:15,161
Drug dealers also take their revenges.

1316
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:18,976
If Neto died, Baiano would be fucked up.

1317
01:37:21,901 --> 01:37:23,113
- Hi...
- Hi...

1318
01:37:23,162 --> 01:37:26,137
Only rich people with social
conscience don't understand

1319
01:37:26,427 --> 01:37:28,150
that war is war.

1320
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:32,150
- Oh yeah?

1321
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:37,002
- What's that, man?
You can't enter here like this...

1322
01:37:37,273 --> 01:37:39,045
- Where's Baiano?
- Shut the fucking up!

1323
01:37:52,064 --> 01:37:54,137
- Put down this weapon, Tim!
For the God's sake...

1324
01:37:55,749 --> 01:37:57,232
- What's going on, Tim?

1325
01:38:17,731 --> 01:38:19,724
- Can you tell me where Matias is?

1326
01:38:19,964 --> 01:38:20,745
- Over there!

1327
01:38:24,591 --> 01:38:26,013
- He may scape, Carvalho!

1328
01:38:26,263 --> 01:38:28,507
- Nascimento, he took two
bullets on his back!

1329
01:38:28,987 --> 01:38:30,880
- They brought him at once, didn't they?

1330
01:38:34,735 --> 01:38:35,587
- What do you want?

1331
01:38:36,047 --> 01:38:37,880
- Is your friend allright?

1332
01:38:38,381 --> 01:38:39,192
- No.

1333
01:38:41,065 --> 01:38:42,737
- I went to the police station, André!

1334
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:46,072
- They told me they can't help me!

1335
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:47,814
- What about Romerito, is he allright?

1336
01:38:48,215 --> 01:38:50,168
- He's fine! He's with me at my house!

1337
01:38:50,688 --> 01:38:51,740
- But...

1338
01:38:52,191 --> 01:38:54,844
... they took Roberta and Rodrigues!

1339
01:38:56,977 --> 01:38:59,771
- Don't worry! Baiano got social consciense!

1340
01:39:01,053 --> 01:39:04,078
- It's serious, André. Rodrigues was bleeding!

1341
01:39:04,558 --> 01:39:06,882
- Didn't you tell me you were a honest cop?

1342
01:39:07,222 --> 01:39:08,865
- Ah! Am I a cop now?

1343
01:39:12,059 --> 01:39:15,043
- Besides, at this time,
they must be already dead!

1344
01:39:28,613 --> 01:39:31,195
- I told you, didn't I?
- Burn this "X9" (rat), boss!

1345
01:39:31,427 --> 01:39:33,340
- No, no, please...

1346
01:39:36,895 --> 01:39:38,097
- Burn! Burn!

1347
01:39:39,038 --> 01:39:40,140
- You'll burn!
- Stop it!

1348
01:39:43,154 --> 01:39:43,735
- Fire!
- No, no, no...

1349
01:40:03,323 --> 01:40:05,775
- You never open your mouth again
to talk about my job at this house!

1350
01:40:05,867 --> 01:40:08,100
- You never open your mouth again
to talk about my job at this house!

1351
01:40:08,721 --> 01:40:09,652
- Do you understand?
- What happened?

1352
01:40:09,972 --> 01:40:15,320
- I am in charge of this shit and you'll
never say a word about my battalion here!

1353
01:40:15,701 --> 01:40:16,652
- Are you understanding it?

1354
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:19,146
- Have you understood?

1355
01:40:21,469 --> 01:40:24,193
- I am in charge of this shit here!

1356
01:40:39,615 --> 01:40:40,937
- Dear, listen to me!

1357
01:40:41,378 --> 01:40:44,452
- Go to your mother's house with the kid
and just come back with a message of mine!

1358
01:40:45,293 --> 01:40:47,667
- Where are you going, tell me,
where are you going?

1359
01:40:48,027 --> 01:40:49,489
- I'll stay around here!

1360
01:40:54,406 --> 01:40:58,192
'Two carbonized bodies were founded
at Pleasures hill last night!'

1361
01:41:00,956 --> 01:41:03,099
'Police believes that the
bodies are of Roberta Lungi,

1362
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:05,262
the businessman Alceu Lungi's daughter,

1363
01:41:05,552 --> 01:41:07,756
and of the social agent Pedro Rodrigues!'

1364
01:41:08,226 --> 01:41:14,025
'Our reporter, Ana Luíza, is there and
has interviewed the security secretary!'

1365
01:41:35,395 --> 01:41:37,256
- What happened?
- Is everything ok?

1366
01:42:35,812 --> 01:42:37,945
Neto's death was a tragedy to Matias.

1367
01:42:39,107 --> 01:42:40,729
They were friends since childhood.

1368
01:42:46,758 --> 01:42:49,281
I realized I could use that feeling.

1369
01:42:49,612 --> 01:42:51,044
I still had my mission to accomplish.

1370
01:43:00,288 --> 01:43:02,691
- What are you doing here?
- It is not time to discuss, André!

1371
01:43:02,841 --> 01:43:04,774
- I am not discussing with you!

1372
01:43:05,074 --> 01:43:07,287
- I am asking what are you doing here!

1373
01:43:07,888 --> 01:43:09,130
- I think I can help you!

1374
01:43:09,521 --> 01:43:11,834
- In wich way can you help me?

1375
01:43:14,748 --> 01:43:16,961
- I know someone who can help you!

1376
01:43:17,963 --> 01:43:18,724
- Who?

1377
01:43:21,318 --> 01:43:24,232
- I will tell you if you
promise me you'll not hurt her!

1378
01:43:27,567 --> 01:43:29,059
- Ok! Who's she?

1379
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:33,886
- It is Rose!

1380
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,853
- Now this bitch will speak it up!

1381
01:43:42,328 --> 01:43:43,499
- Will you speak it up now?

1382
01:43:45,032 --> 01:43:48,407
- Where's that piece of shit boyfriend of yours?
- I don't know, I don't know!

1383
01:43:49,037 --> 01:43:51,351
- Look at me, where's the guy?
- I don't know!

1384
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:00,904
- That's it. It's over! You say it now!

1385
01:44:01,185 --> 01:44:02,717
- It is now! Speak it up now!

1386
01:44:17,869 --> 01:44:21,303
- You've "lost it"! Hands up!
- I'm a worker, brother!

1387
01:44:21,434 --> 01:44:24,208
- Worker is the bicth who gave you born!
Look at me, you don't do any fucking thing!

1388
01:44:26,101 --> 01:44:27,242
- Where is Baiano?
- I don't kn...

1389
01:44:28,594 --> 01:44:29,966
- Where is Baiano, you sick fuck?

1390
01:44:31,972 --> 01:44:34,543
- You got to take an answer quickly,
or else he starts twisting the truth!

1391
01:44:35,364 --> 01:44:37,197
- Where's the fucking Baiano,
you son of a whore?

1392
01:44:37,727 --> 01:44:39,330
- Where is Baiano?
- Speak it up!

1393
01:44:45,048 --> 01:44:46,891
- Where is Baiano?
- The playboy...

1394
01:44:47,111 --> 01:44:49,074
... playboy said he was
"PM" not a BOPE officer!

1395
01:44:49,364 --> 01:44:50,446
- What playboy?

1396
01:44:50,796 --> 01:44:52,778
- Who's this playboy! What playboy?
- Captain, captain!

1397
01:44:52,849 --> 01:44:54,622
- Captain, this one I know, captain!

1398
01:45:45,835 --> 01:45:47,818
Nobody goes to a protest
whem a policeman dies.

1399
01:45:48,569 --> 01:45:50,272
Protest is against rich people's death.

1400
01:45:51,313 --> 01:45:53,847
When I see a protest against
violence, buddy,

1401
01:45:54,538 --> 01:45:56,891
I feel a will down inside
me to kick some ass.

1402
01:45:57,844 --> 01:45:59,966
- Son of a whore!
- Stop André!

1403
01:46:00,356 --> 01:46:02,079
- Stop!

1404
01:46:02,429 --> 01:46:03,821
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone!

1405
01:46:07,026 --> 01:46:08,508
- Stop it!
- Son of a whore!

1406
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:11,092
- You sick fuck! I'll fuck you up!

1407
01:46:11,973 --> 01:46:14,046
- Stop it! Get out of here!
- You don't hold me!

1408
01:46:14,797 --> 01:46:16,830
- Stop André!
- He killed my friend, fuck!

1409
01:46:18,102 --> 01:46:19,494
- He killed my friend!
- You leave me now!

1410
01:46:20,485 --> 01:46:21,957
- What's this, Matias?

1411
01:46:22,839 --> 01:46:25,963
- What? Will you fight with a cop?
- Leave him!

1412
01:46:28,288 --> 01:46:30,289
- You're a bunch of sons of whores!

1413
01:46:30,490 --> 01:46:31,781
- Just like him!

1414
01:46:32,683 --> 01:46:34,375
- A bunch of rich motherfucker tramps!

1415
01:46:36,108 --> 01:46:36,899
- Get out of here, André!

1416
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:39,282
- What, you bitch?

1417
01:46:39,753 --> 01:46:41,075
- You're just like him!

1418
01:46:42,216 --> 01:46:44,599
- A bunch of pot heads sons of whores!

1419
01:46:44,790 --> 01:46:49,977
Matias wasn't just taking his revenge.
He was becomming a real policeman.

1420
01:46:50,188 --> 01:46:51,610
- Open this door, you fuck!
- What's this?

1421
01:46:52,691 --> 01:46:55,566
- What for this weapon?
- Where's the fucking pot?

1422
01:46:56,797 --> 01:46:58,450
- Where's the fucking
pot you son of a whore?

1423
01:46:59,011 --> 01:47:00,913
- Where's the fucking pot?
- Ok, ok!

1424
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:02,335
- Ok, allrigth, fuck!

1425
01:47:02,616 --> 01:47:05,370
- Then bring it here now,
you faggy son of a whore!

1426
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:11,829
The question was if he would got heart
to go all the way through the end.

1427
01:47:14,433 --> 01:47:17,107
My mission wasn't to garantee
Pope's dream anymore.

1428
01:47:18,338 --> 01:47:20,091
It had been already accomplished by Neto.

1429
01:47:21,923 --> 01:47:23,886
What I needed was to
come back to my family

1430
01:47:23,946 --> 01:47:26,300
and to find a good substitute to replace me.

1431
01:47:27,772 --> 01:47:28,603
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

1432
513
01:47:29,024 --> 01:47:32,709
To do that, I had to catch Baiano first.

1433
01:47:35,263 --> 01:47:36,795
What I was doing were not right.

1434
01:47:37,656 --> 01:47:40,550
- Pull over, take off your
t-shirt! Turn back! Go away!

1435
01:47:40,901 --> 01:47:43,715
I couldn't mess with all "favela"'s
inhabitant to find a criminal.

1436
01:47:44,386 --> 01:47:47,630
But at that time, everything
was worthy to me.

1437
01:47:48,532 --> 01:47:50,424
Nothing would stop me.

1438
01:47:50,957 --> 01:47:53,859
- You do a 3-6-0 with your team at that
entrance, André! - Yes, sir!

1439
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:55,241
- There's nobody on the "road"!
- Yes, sir!

1440
01:47:55,822 --> 01:47:57,585
- We will take them out house by house!

1441
01:47:58,386 --> 01:47:59,207
- Open it up!

1442
01:47:59,608 --> 01:48:01,470
- Police, hands on the table!

1443
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:03,794
- Wake up, tramp, wake up!

1444
01:48:06,748 --> 01:48:07,309
- Good morning, son!

1445
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:10,804
- I would like to ask permission
to search your house, could we?

1446
01:48:11,274 --> 01:48:11,825
- Yes, sir!

1447
01:48:12,306 --> 01:48:13,658
- Can I be your guest?
- Be my guest!

1448
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,652
- 04, search this wardrobe here!

1449
1
01:48:22,767 --> 01:48:26,259
- Look at this, 01! These shoes
worth more than my wage!

1450
01:48:24,767 --> 01:48:28,259
- How did you get these shoes?

1451
01:48:28,569 --> 01:48:29,350
- I earned it, sir!

1452
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:31,263
- You haven't earned it!
You've lost it!

1453
01:48:32,455 --> 01:48:35,179
- This will become shit, captain! Inhabitants
are seeing everything we're doing and...

1454
01:48:35,459 --> 01:48:36,931
- Renam, Renam!

1455
01:48:37,182 --> 01:48:39,575
- The guy killed Neto,
I came here to catch him!

1456
01:48:39,956 --> 01:48:41,959
- I will "break" him today!
If you want to go away...

1457
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:43,170
- Do you want to go away?

1458
01:48:43,521 --> 01:48:45,704
- We all will end up at the
police station, captain...

1459
01:48:46,014 --> 01:48:49,159
- If you want to go away, take
your team with you and go away!

1460
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:51,552
- Take these with you! Are
you pitty? Take them with you!

1461
01:48:51,693 --> 01:48:52,814
- Those who stay are
those who want to stay!

1462
01:48:55,368 --> 01:48:56,950
- Are you student?
Do know how to fly, student?

1463
01:48:58,172 --> 01:48:59,183
- Are you student?

1464
01:49:02,027 --> 01:49:03,940
- Let me tell you something!
I don't want to hurt you!

1465
01:49:04,321 --> 01:49:06,224
- I don't want you to leave
wounded, do you understand?

1466
01:49:07,155 --> 01:49:08,747
- Where is Baiano?
- I don't know, sir!

1467
01:49:09,701 --> 01:49:11,633
- Speak it up, kid!

1468
01:49:11,701 --> 01:49:12,733
- I'll introduce you to the bag!

1469
01:49:13,965 --> 01:49:15,126
- Get him on his knees!

1470
01:49:18,081 --> 01:49:20,344
- Son, where is Baiano?
- I don't know!

1471
01:49:20,664 --> 01:49:21,976
- Where is Baiano?
- I don't know, sir!

1472
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:23,659
- Where is Baiano? - Speak it up!
- I don't know, sir!

1473
01:49:24,089 --> 01:49:25,271
- Where is Baiano?
- I don't know, sir!

1474
01:49:25,872 --> 01:49:26,853
- Put him in the bag!

1475
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:41,765
- Where is the fucking Baiano, you
son of whore? - I don't know, sir!

1476
01:49:42,706 --> 01:49:44,599
- Speak it up! - You're going to die!
- I don't know, sir!

1477
01:49:46,281 --> 01:49:47,823
- Captain, it seems he'll not talk!

1478
01:49:49,045 --> 01:49:50,147
- Drop his pants!

1479
01:49:51,398 --> 01:49:52,710
- What? Are you crazy?

1480
01:49:53,061 --> 01:49:56,376
- You're going to speak it up,
you fucking son of a whore!

1481
01:49:58,769 --> 01:50:00,542
- I'll show you how crazy we are,
you fuck! Leave this shit to me!

1482
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:01,663
- Leave this shit to me!
- Stop it, fuck!

1483
01:50:02,104 --> 01:50:03,556
- Will you tell us or won't you?
- Drop his pants! - I'll tell you!

1484
01:50:04,027 --> 01:50:05,359
- Speak it up at once!
- I'll tell you, I'll tell you!

1485
01:50:05,929 --> 01:50:07,642
- What? Will you tell us?
- I'll tell you!

1486
01:50:07,929 --> 01:50:09,642
- Come on, take him!

1487
01:50:23,929 --> 01:50:26,642
- Fuck, Xaveco!

1488
01:50:26,929 --> 01:50:30,642
- It has been a long time since
they contact us through the radio!

1489
01:50:30,929 --> 01:50:33,642
- It's allrigth, boss! Let's
stay here! It is calm down there!

1490
01:50:33,929 --> 01:50:38,642
- There's something wrong!
The hill is too much calm, brother!

1491
01:50:38,929 --> 01:50:43,642
- It is calm, it's allrigth, boss!
- Calm my dick, you fuck!

1492
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:46,642
- Go get some water and check it out!

1493
01:50:58,929 --> 01:51:00,642
- Here it is!

1494
01:51:15,929 --> 01:51:17,642
- Nobody else in here, captain!

1495
01:51:23,929 --> 01:51:26,642
- Let's talk, my chief, let's talk!

1496
01:51:26,929 --> 01:51:29,642
- I got many things to
learn from you, my chief!

1497
01:51:29,929 --> 01:51:32,642
- Take me to the hospital, my chief!

1498
01:51:32,929 --> 01:51:35,642
- You have already lost it,
you son of a whore!

1499
01:51:35,929 --> 01:51:38,642
- Come on... - You have already
lost it! You are going to die!

1500
01:51:38,929 --> 01:51:42,642
- Not at my face, chief,
to do not ruin the funeral!

1501
01:51:42,929 --> 01:51:43,542
- What?

1502
01:51:43,629 --> 01:51:45,642
- Not at my face to do
not ruin the funeral!

1503
01:51:47,266 --> 01:51:48,837
Baiano was dead, my friend.

1504
01:51:49,929 --> 01:51:51,642
- 07, bring the shotgun over here!

1505
01:51:51,929 --> 01:51:53,622
- Let this kid go!

1506
01:51:53,624 --> 01:51:55,527
Now I would work Matias' heart!

1507
01:51:56,188 --> 01:51:57,800
And then my mission would be over.

1508
01:52:00,544 --> 01:52:01,796
I would come back to my family.

1509
01:52:02,327 --> 01:52:04,670
I would know that someone
worthy would replace me.

1510
01:52:05,327 --> 01:52:08,670
- "Fry" him! He's yours!
- Wait a minute man...

1511
01:52:10,327 --> 01:52:12,670
- Wait a minute, fuck...

1512
01:52:14,727 --> 01:52:16,970
Not at my face, fuck!

1513
01:52:28,527 --> 01:52:36,970
