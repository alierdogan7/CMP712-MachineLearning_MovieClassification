[MAN]
Driver's name is Arthur Shea.

2
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,880
Former Medford police officer
57 years old.

3
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,390
Soon as his partner leaves with
the coal bag...

4
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,800
..,Artie cracks The Herald,
and he don't look up till the guy gets back.

Makes $110 a day. Carries a SIG 9.

9
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,240
And he's about to get robbed.

10
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,110
We're fucked if we see a helicopter,
we're fucked if we see SWAT.

11
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,830
We see a cruiser, stop, take out
the engine blocks, keep moving.

12
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,240
No one needs to get hurt.

13
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,380
Now, these guards
like to test you, though.

14
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,460
They want to get hurt for $10 an hour,
don't get in the way.

15
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,880
Let's go.

Slide your fucking phones up.

Not you. You. Get up. Let's go.

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,960
[DOUG] When's the time lock set for?
-9:00.

38
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,840
Don't lie to us, it's 8:15.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,130
Listen, it's not your money.
You understand? Don't lie to us again.

[DEZ] Hold it. Silent alarm, this address.

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,560
[JEM] Who did it?
-Look, nobody did anything.

60
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,240
[JEM] What? Huh? What'd you say?
[BEARNS] Nobody did anything.

61
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,650
[JEM] You pull the alarm?
-No. No.

62
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,560
[JEM] Did you?
[BEARNS] I didn't pull any alarm.

63

Head for the boulevard.

All right? No one's gonna hurt you.

What's up?

76
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,710
Boosted a city work van.
Which still hasn't been reported stolen.

77
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,720
[FRAWLEY]
Probably too busy working.

78
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,090
Used the van to screen the door.

79
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,350
Bleached the entire place for DNA.

80
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,970

Our guys waited for the time lock
to expire...

84
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,270
...then they had the manager
open sesame.

85
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,740
Under duress?

as the guy with the key.

[FRAWLEY] Nice to be back home, Dino?
[DINO] Yeah.

It's all the love I get
makes the homecoming feel so warm.

95
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,560
Could be 50 people here
eyewitnessed these guys.

96
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,450
And 50 hands on a bible
saying they never saw nothing.

97
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,120
Well, it's a pro job.

98
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,490
All the pro guys I know are away...

99
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,830
,..so I guess we got new pro guys.

100
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,930
The part of the job where
we get to do something...

101
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,010
,..that has no point and yields no results.
Excuse me.

-Mm-hm.

And did you try to escape
at any point?

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,160
No.

138
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,870
Is there anything you can identify
about the men? Anything you'd testify to?

139
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,500
I didn't try to escape
because they had guns.

140
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,260
I understand.

141
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,920

residual effects.

It's gonna be okay.

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,650
"if you talk to the FBI, we'll come
to your house and fuck you and kill you."

-I'll do it.
-Why are you gonna do it?

we're having this conversation.

-I'm gonna get it done.
-What are you gonna get done? Huh?

152
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,090
You get picked up
for intimidating a witness.

153
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,790
You walk within 100 feet of her,
that's 10 years. Okay?

154
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,010
You got two strikes against you already.
They're gonna bury you under the jail.

155
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,260
How much money's in the sack?

156
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,220
All right, we got 90 a pop.

for the Florist.

Hey, Jem, what happened
with the assistant manager?

159
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,310
Yeah. Well, next time Skeletor comes
in the bank with an AK...

160
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,690
...I think he's gonna think twice
about hitting that alarm, isn't he?

161
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,900
He's lucky he just got tuned up.

162
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,360
Are you gonna catch them?

163
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,700
Yes.

164
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,490
This is the FBI.

-What? What is it?
-Stickup.

499
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,790

500
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,050
What would we do without Chelsea?

501
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,340
Anyway, aren't there rules?

502
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,090
Against dating the Vic?
Yeah, there's a rule.

503
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,930
You don't do it.

[DOUG] There she is.
-Hey.

505
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,020
[DOUG] All set?
-Yes,

506
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,020
I should have come
get your door for you, huh?

507
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,110
What kind of a guy lets you open
your own door like that?

508
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,690
What?

509
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,530
I have to get something out there...

510
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,170
,..otherwise I'll be pretending
to listen to you all night...

511

...when really I'm thinking about
something else.

512
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,290
Okay.

513
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,460
A few days ago my bank was robbed.

514
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,180
Four men took it over
and opened the safe.

515
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,640
They took me as a hostage.

516
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,060
They blindfolded me
and drove me around.

517
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,360
And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and ....

518
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,020
And one of the guys told me...

519
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,000
,..to walk until I felt the water
on my toes.

520
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,280
It was the longest walk of my life.
I kept thinking I'd step off a cliff.

521
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,920
And then I felt the water.

522
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,670
I'm sorry.

523
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,590
It's not your fault.

524
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,680
Anyway, the FBI guy told me
it would feel like I was in mourning.

525
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,970

526
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,560
Mm-hm.

527
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,230
What does that mean?

528
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,730
Guy comes by, checks in on you,
gives you a call? That kind of thing?

529
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,900
Pretty much.

530
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,280
They don't have any suspects?
Any clues? Any leads? Anything like that?

531
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,040
I don't know.
Not that they've told me.

532
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,040
He intimated that they were
scouring Charlestown...

533
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,710
,..but they were wearing masks, so....

534
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,710
-Shit.
-Mm.

535
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,510
I'm sure I'd recognize their voices
if I heard them again.

536
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,890
I don't know,
might be harder than you think.

537
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,850
At least you weren't hurt.

538
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,360
No.

539
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,560
No, but David was.

540
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,860
My assistant manager, he was assaulted
really badly when the alarm went off.

541
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,650
He's been at Mass Eye and Ear
for a week.

542
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,410

543
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,660
And I still haven't been able
to go see him.

544
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,830
I feel like a terrible person.

545
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,170

where we're going.

Well, you should come in.

-Yeah, you should meet him.

570
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,580
[CLAIRE]
When the guy attacked David...

571
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,340
,..l could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.

572

Of what?

573
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,470
It was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.

574
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,180
I'm afraid if I report it
they'll make me testify.

575
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,680
What do you think I should do?

576
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,350
Tell the FBI.

577
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,690
If the guy's got a record,
and I'm sure he does...

578
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,480
,..they'll have his tattoos on tile.

579
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,950
They'll ring him up the next day.

580
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,110
Robbery, weapons. He'll get 30 years.

581
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,830
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.

582
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,870
The FBI will probably want to put you in
WITSEC, you know, Witness Security.

583
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,090
You know, they'll probably put you
somewhere, like, you know, in Cleveland...

somewhere safe.

can go home and nuke their supper.

me to say that this truck is a little much?

I can throw it in the back.

Took a guess.
I mean, it just seemed like a toonie car.

-Yeah.

-What?

who trashed my car, but--

613

it started with yelling when I walked by...

really aggressive and ....

Once glass bottles
started getting thrown...

...I started coming to terms with not being
cool enough to walk through the projects.

in the doorway in my Underoos.

01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,480
What?

1160
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,870
What are you gonna do?

1161
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:27,500
Uh, I don't know. Volunteer full-time.
Maybe go back to teaching.

1162
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:30,790
I have a little cushion.

1163
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,130
You know...

1164
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:38,080
...people get up every day,
they do the same thing.

1165
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:42,380
They tell themself they're gonna
change their life one day and they never do.

1166
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:45,140
I'm gonna change mine.

1167
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:49,020
Why don't you do it with me?

1168
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,770
Go somewhere.

1169
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:56,980
I got a little sofa put away.

1170
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:00,990
Give it a shot.

1171
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:05,360
Well, where would we go?

1172
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,370
Wherever you want. I don't know.

1173
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,000
See what we got there.

1174
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,960
Doesn't have to be a big thing, you know?
I thought about going down to...

1175
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:19,340
,..see if my grandma's place is still there.
Tangerine, Florida.

1176
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,840
But I'll go to any town
named after a food.

1177
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,930
Grapefruit, Michigan.
Watermelon, New Mexico.

1178
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:27,720
Just pick it on a map.

1179
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:35,640
You ever read that paper The Town?

1180
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:38,560
-The free paper? Yeah.
-Uh-huh,

1181
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:44,240
I was clearing my foyer the other day...

1182
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,870
...and there was a picture of the guys
who were harassing me in the bricks.

1183
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:51,450
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

1184
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,670
It was an article
about how one of them got shot.

1185
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,250
-Say who did it?
-No.

1186
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:01,510
Local gangsters, apparently.

1187
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:07,300
I guess that's what you get
for being out on the street dealing drugs.

1188
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:11,010
What makes you say
they were dealing drugs?

1189
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:16,150
I grew up out there, Claire.
Believe me, that kid was selling drugs.

1190
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:20,440
What do you want me to say?

1191
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:25,240
I feel bad the kid who was terrorizing you
ran into the wrong guys?

1192
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,400
Believe me, I don't.

1193
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,660
You know, I care about you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

1194
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:33,830
You don't go after women.

1195
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:36,960
He hurt you, someone hurt him.
Too bad. That's the way it goes.

1196
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,250
You know? That's karma.

1197
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:45,130
I don't think karma works like that.

1198
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,440
Well, however it works,
it worked out bad for them kids, you know?

1199
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:55,600
And I'm not gonna shed a tear over it.

1200
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,100
Let's go get some food, okay?

1201
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:05,270
[DINO]
Frawl.

1202
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:08,950
What is it?

1203
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:12,790
Phone conversation between Claire Keesey
and a burner cell about an hour ago.

1204
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:15,540
See if you can recognize the voice.

1205
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:18,960
[DOUG] Hey, can I come over?
I want to talk to you.

1206
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,960
[CLAIRE]
Yeah. Where have you been?

1207
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:22,790
[DOUG]
Sorry, I got held up.

1208
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,800
Fm coming over from my place.

1209
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,930
Will you come down the back
and let me in?

1210
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,970
[FRAWLEY] Hadn't realized you'd left
your job at the bank.

1211
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:36,690
[CLAIRE]
Uh .... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Last week.

1212
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,940
I'm sorry,
was I supposed to notify someone?

1213
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:47,320
Fancy.

1214
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,120
Yeah. It was a gift.

1215
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:57,330
Look, I think maybe you should go.

1216
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:59,540
We have our suspects.

1217
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,540
I came by to share this with you.

1218
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,880
James Coughlin.

1219
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:11,100
Albert Magloan.

1220
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:13,970
Desmond Elden.

1221
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:17,060
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bank job at North End...

1222
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:21,320
,..and at least three other
armored car robberies.

1223
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:27,320
Look familiar?

1224
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:32,530
You opened the safe for him.

1225
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,700
He left you unharmed...

1226
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:40,920
...and now the two of you are carrying on a
relationship about which you lied to the FBI.

1227
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,170
I was wrong.

1228
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,040
You do need a lawyer.

1229
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:54,670
[DOUG]
Something wrong with the apartment?

1230
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,060
[JEM]
No, Florist.

1231
01:27:57,970 --> 01:27:59,140
Florist? What?

1232
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,810
Came through.

1233
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:04,560
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-it's large, Dougy.

1234
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:06,900
-it's large.
-We're smoked. Punt it.

1235
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:10,200
-Who else is gonna buy it?
-You should've thought about that...

1236
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,950
,..before you kept breaking the guy off
for 40 dimes.

1237
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:15,450
-There's an expectation for me.
-I'll correct it.

1238
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:19,240
-Oh, you will? Okay.
-Yeah. Look.

1239
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:24,580
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

1240
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:27,080
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

1241
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:29,220
Oh, so you're not going?

1242
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,630
No.

1243
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:34,840
And why's that?

1244
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,350
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

1245
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:39,930
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

1246
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:43,140
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.

1247
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:44,930
-What? What?
-I'm done.

1248
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,440
-You're done?
-What does it sound like?

1249
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,280
-I don't know. What's that mean?
-What you think it means?

1250
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,910
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

1251
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:56,950
Let me put it to you this way - I'm putting
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.

1252
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:01,780
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.

1253
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,460
What?

1254
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,620
Who?

1255
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,670
Come on.

1256
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,590
Are you serious, Jimmy?

1257
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,800
She's not my kid.

1258
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,020
I mean, come the f-- Cut it out.

1259
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:26,270
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...

1260
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:29,310
,..now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

1261
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,360
Know what your problem is?
You think you're better than people.

1262
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,200
Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

1263
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,110
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.

1264
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,530
But you grew up right here.

1265
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:43,210
Same rules that I did.

1266
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:45,040
Okay.

1267
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:47,040
What else?

1268
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,670
Who the fuck's the father?

1269
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:54,000
-I know I'm not.
-You were the one fucking her.

1270
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:56,420
Yeah, I wasn't the only one, brother.

1271
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:58,890
Okay? She knew
l knew I'm not the father...

1272
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:01,640
,..and I have enough respect for her
not to ask her.

1273
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,520
Because I don't think she knows.

1274
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,520
I don't wanna shatter
your illusions here, partner.

1275
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,810
There aren't enough free clinics
in Mattapan...

1276
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:11,570
,..to ind out who the father
of that kid is.

1277
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,570
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are either.

1278
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:17,950
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

1279
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:19,780
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.

1280
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:23,040
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

1281
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,790
,..fucking playing house up there.

1282
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:28,250
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

1283
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:31,410
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

1284
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:35,710
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.

1285
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:42,640
[JEM]
Cunt.

1286
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:12,830
In the 302,..

1287
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,300
,..feds have me dropping Brendan
right here.

1288
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,180
I got him back on Tibbetts.

1289
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,760
Shot him right in the chest.

1290
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,600
I remember he looked at me.

1291
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,260
I don't know who was more fucking
surprised he wasn't dead, him or me.

1292
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,600
We just kind of stood there...

1293
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:36,740
,..for a second, like, waiting for some
shit to happen. I don't know what.

1294
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,610
He started running.

1295
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:43,080
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

1296
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:47,370
I mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what I'm saying?

1297
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:52,830
I didn't ask you to do that.

1298
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,120
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

1299
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:59,710
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21,

1300
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,850
So I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.

1301
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,430
Did nine years for it.

1302
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:10,140
Now, you don't gotta thank me...

1303
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:12,640
,..but you're not walking away.

1304
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:17,650
I'm grateful for everything you done
for me.

1305
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,910
Your family took me in
when my father went away.

1306
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,580
You're like a brother to me.

1307
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,000
But I'm leaving.

1308
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:34,450
Gonna shoot me?

1309
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:37,170
Go ahead.

1310
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:40,880
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.

1311
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,020
-Don't get up.
-All right.

1312
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:56,980
How you doing, Fergie?

1313
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:00,940
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

1314
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:04,440
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...

1315
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:07,700
...I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?

1316
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,860
I wouldn't hire them without you.

1317
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:11,950
And I wouldn't hire you without them.

1318
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,370
You're a unit.

1319
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:17,330
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.

1320
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:19,540
I'm not doing it.

1321
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:23,670
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I ....

1322
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,640

1826
02:16:13,570 --> 02:16:15,320
Claire, I wanna meet you.

1827
02:16:16,950 --> 02:16:20,290
It's gotta be soon.
I don't have a lot of time.

1828
02:16:21,790 --> 02:16:23,290
Can you meet me?

1829
02:16:24,290 --> 02:16:25,460
Claire, please.

1830
02:16:26,290 --> 02:16:28,710
I need to know. I gotta go.

1831
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:31,470
Can you come here?

1832
02:16:37,470 --> 02:16:39,520
You want me
to come where you are now?

1833
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:41,060
Mm-hm.

1834
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:47,480
I don't think
that's a good idea for me.

1835
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:52,490
Why?

1836
02:16:57,820 --> 02:16:59,620
What if there are police there?

1837
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:03,250
There's no one here.

1838
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,920
All right, well, if you think I should
probably come by there...

1839
02:17:12,090 --> 02:17:14,510
,..then I guess that's what I'll do. Yeah.

1840
02:17:16,010 --> 02:17:17,180
Okay.

1841
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:21,480
Claire, listen, I'm--
Listen. Listen to me.

1842
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:25,140
I'm sorry, okay?

1843
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:28,780
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1844
02:17:30,190 --> 02:17:31,530
Remember that.

1845
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:35,200
Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour:

1846
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:39,500
All right?

1847
02:17:41,370 --> 02:17:42,990
I'll see you.

1848
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:46,210
Wait, Doug? Doug?

1849
02:17:47,330 --> 02:17:48,800
-Yeah.
-I want you to come.

1850
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:51,880
I really wanna see you.

1851
02:17:56,590 --> 02:17:59,560
It'll be just like one of my sunny days.

1852
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:13,070
Well...

1853
02:18:15,230 --> 02:18:16,910
,..I'm on my way then.

1854
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:20,740
Bye.

1855
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:26,330
Goodbye, Claire.

1856
02:18:32,460 --> 02:18:34,680
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.

1857
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:37,460
You know what? Not now.

1858
02:18:43,430 --> 02:18:46,270
He says he's coming, I want people
at Logan, South Station...

1859
02:18:46,430 --> 02:18:48,810
...downtown, Greyhound,
subway, everything. Now.

1860
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:51,230
[DINO] The city's covered.
[FRAWLEY] Good.

1861
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,750
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
We 're secure, and everything 's ready.

1862
02:19:23,010 --> 02:19:26,980
-Sir, we need you to stay off the street.
-Just going to work. No problem.

1863
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:44,910
-How long?
-Forty minutes.

1864
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:47,280
-Alleyway clear?
-Yes, sir.

1865
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:03,890
[MAN OVER RADIO] We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.

1866
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:08,510
Well, I guess he didn't have as big a thing
for you as you thought.

1867
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:12,110
I guess not.

1868
02:20:33,910 --> 02:20:35,510
"My sunny days."

1869
02:20:43,090 --> 02:20:45,890
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.

1870
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:57,030
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.

1871
02:20:57,190 --> 02:20:59,660
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.

1872
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:01,740
We know what he looks like.

1873
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:04,120
Let's go ind him.

1874
02:21:07,740 --> 02:21:08,860
All right. You good?

1875
02:21:09,030 --> 02:21:10,830
Hey, best possible outcome, you know.

1876
02:21:10,990 --> 02:21:12,920
Well done, well done.

1877
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:52,170
It's for you.

1878
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,940
[DOUG]
Claire, take this.

1879
02:23:01,230 --> 02:23:03,860
You'll do better with it than I can.

1880
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:07,070
By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.

1881
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:08,530
Not the way I planned it...

1882
02:23:09,030 --> 02:23:13,080
...but for the first time in my life,
l?n leaving this city.

1883
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:26,720
Maybe if I go...

1884
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,420
...I can stop looking.

1885
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:53,160
No matter how much you change...

1886
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:56,250
You still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.

1887
02:23:59,410 --> 02:24:01,250
So I got a long road.

1888
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:09,260
But I know I'll see you again.

1889
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:17,090
This side or the other.
