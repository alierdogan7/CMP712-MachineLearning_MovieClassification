00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,480
lt's time for
What's Cooking Tonight?

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,320
Here are your hosts,
Melbourne's greatest chefs...

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,000
Baggio and Jackie!

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,360
Thank you.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,840
Tonight, we combine
the culinary arts...

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,800
of the East and West.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,760
Easy there, Jackie.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,760
First, knead the dough.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,480
lt's like giving your true love
a sensuous massage.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,920
Then stretch and twist
the dough.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,360
Ladies, later, Jackie will do
the same to your hair.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,120
Now pull the dough
into fine spaghetti noodles.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,400
The alchemist works his magic,
and before your eyes...

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,760
a lump of dough transforms
into delicious pasta.

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,840
Tina, baby.

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
You are so beautiful.

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,280
l know who you are.
You're with the Demons.

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,080
Take her to the guesthouse!

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,840
Let go of me!

21
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,960
Enjoy your stay!

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
Scumbag!

23
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,800
Tuck her in, boys!

24
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,640
Let's go to town.

25
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,040
lt's Tara.
She's a Demon girl.

26
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,040
For this bitch you betray me?

27
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,400
l just...

28
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,320
How much did they pay you?

29
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,520
l think l was drunk.

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,320
l didn't know she was a Demon.

31
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,080
Some punk stole my coke...

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,320
because you couldn't
control yourself?

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,120
l'll get it back.

34
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,280
God!

35
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,480
Boss, the Demons are here!

36
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,000
You.

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,160
Tara, you bitch.

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,640
You set me up.

39
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,720
Careful!

40
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,080
l'm good at cutting things off.

41
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,040
Excuse me.

42
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,520
l thought we were here
to do business.

43
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,840
Mr. Giancarlo, let's deal.

44
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,080
Here's half a million.

45
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,480
Give me back what's mine,
l let you walk away.

46
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,920
Half a million, huh?

47
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
How much do you want?

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,000
All of it.

49
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,200
Not the whole 10 million.

50
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
What's the world coming to...

51
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,480
when a businessman has to pay
to buy back his own stuff?

52
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Your stuff, huh?
Only stuff l got is mine!

53
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,000
Call me
when you're ready to deal.

54
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,760
l'll kill you!

55
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,840
Go to hell!

56
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,040
You first!

57
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,880
Let's get out of here!

58
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,040
Who the hell...

59
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,640
Shit.

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,000

61
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,240

62
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,640
Hurry up!

63
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,280
Hurry!

64
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,800
Go!

65
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,920
Get out of the way, Dave.

66
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,920
-What's this?
-The girl and guy dropped it.

67
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
-Where's the tape?
-The girl took it.

68
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,920

69
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000

-l want that tape!
-Right.

71
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,520
l want this place spotless.

72
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,640
Let's go.

73
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,080
Move aside!

74
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,520

76
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Look out!

77
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,640
Why are they after you?

78
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,200
l don't know.
l didn't do anything.

79
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,560
There she is!

80
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,560
You OK?

81
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,520
Empty.

82
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
Now it's empty!

83
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,360
Go!

84
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,520
Keep looking! Over there!

85
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,320

86
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,640

95
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,920
This time, you go your way,
l go my way.

96
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,840
Which way are you going?

97
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
-That way.
-Bye-bye.

98
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,080
There he is!

99
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,920
l don't know her!

100
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,400
You understand?

101
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,160

Yeah. Me!

109
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,800
Another Chinese guy.

Hi, Lakeisha.

147
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,880

and l was shot at.

157
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,800
They were chasing a woman
they thought was with me.

158
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,120
Was anybody hurt?

159
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,280
My poor car is full of holes.

160
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,200
-Where'd this happen, downtown?
-lt did.

161
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,720
Who was this woman?

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,880
Her name's Diana.

163
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,240
She said to watch
the Big Story tonight.

164
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,120
l should take this down
so l can file a report.

165
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,960
Put that away. You're off duty.

166
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,880
l don't want
to talk about it now.

167
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
For this bitch you betray me?

168
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,400
This is cool!

Oh, my God.

172
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,400
First, knead the dough.

173
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,880
lt's like giving your true love
a sensuous massage.

174
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,480
Help me.

175
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,920
Who is it?

176
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,400
Richard.

177
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,760
Let me in.

178
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,320
Sorry.

179
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,400
Now pull the dough into fine....

180
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,920
Hold it. This ain't the tape.

181
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,240
Where's the tape?

182
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,760

183
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,600
...is transformed
into delicious pasta.

184
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,040
Don't try anything stupid.

185
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,280
Whatever you say.

186
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,720
-Sorry.
-Sorry?

187
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,680
You trying to get
a cheap thrill?

188
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,360
Don't just stand there
acting innocent.

189
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,120
Did you get a good feel?

190
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,040
That's OK. You can go.

191
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,160
Move it.

192
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,600
Don't push me!

193
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,320
That guy's trying to cop a feel.

194
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,440
Hurry it up!

195
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,760
What's the hurry?

196
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,600
You men are all the same.
You can't wait, can you?

197
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,920
Can't wait to see
what you've paid for.

198
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,480
No worries.

199
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,160
What's this?

200
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,880
A gun?

201
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,000
Kinky!

202
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,640
Out of my way!

203
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,560
Watch out!

204
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,960
Come on. Get up.

205
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,200
Where'd she go?

206
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,480
Come on, this way.

207
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,640
Right.

208
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,520
What the hell's going on?

209
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,480
What's with all that?
Did you see that?

210
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,960
They've gone.

211
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,840
Where's the phone?

212
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,120
Over there.

213
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,240
This looks great.

214
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,600
l can't wait to see what happens
on the Big Story.

215
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,480
What do you think
of Jackie's new recipes?

216
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,560
Delicious.

217
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,960
You never say that
about my cooking.

218
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,480
Grandpa, you've always said
being a chef is the best.

219
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,120
Yeah. Being a cop
is too dangerous.

220
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,920
The kitchen is a safe place.

221
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,560
That's right.
That's why Jackie's not a cop.

222
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,240
That's true.

223
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,240
Jackie's dad and l
were best friends.

224
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,440
We owned a restaurant together.

225
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,600
Before he died...

226
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,000
l promised l'd take care
of Jackie and keep him safe.

227
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,520
As long as l'm around,
Jackie's a chef, not a cop.

228
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,680
l'll go get dessert.

229
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,200
Strange.
The Big Story is not on tonight.

230
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,800
Where's your mystery woman?

231
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,920
l don't know.

232
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,520
What are you doing
tomorrow morning?

233
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,600
Taking a load of videos
for the show.

234
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,320
Why? What do you want?

235
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,280
-Can you take me to the airport?
-OK.

236
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,280
Sonny, Nancy, Come on. 
We're going!

237
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,360
Sonny, We're leaving! Come on!

238
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,040
Come on! Sonny, We're leaving!

239
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,440
He's dead.

240
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,880
He's gonna pay for this.

241
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,120
Giancarlo, you're a dead man.

242
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,520
Snake's dead, Tina's missing.

243
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,400
l'll teach you
to mess with the Demons.

244
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,760
What do you think you're doing?

245
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,000
l'm gonna shove these
up Giancarlo's ass.

246
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,120
l'm gonna kill them all!

247
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,440
Shut up!
You'll get us all killed.

248
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,880
You bitch.

249
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,240
Look at you.

250
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,520
Who do you want to kill,
me or Giancarlo?

251
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,360
How long is she staying?

252
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,480
l don't know.

253
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,240
lf she likes it,
she may stay longer.

254
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,720
Are you going to marry her?

255
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,440
Maybe.

256
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,880
Do you love her?

257
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,000
Miki.

258
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,160
What?

259
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,680
Nice to meet you.

260
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,800
What'd you say?

261
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together...

262
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,440

culinary cut-ups...

263

to "Feed the Hungry."

275
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
Anybody hungry?

277
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,320

Here we go.

282
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Careful.
Don't get egg on your face.

283
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,520
Me!

284
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,360

Go.

289
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,800
Trouble is coming.

290
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,920
What trouble?

291
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,560
Go. Quick.

292
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,800
Gentlemen,
please take your seat.

293
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,480
You'll get your turn.

294
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,240
Stop it!

295
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,440
Call security.

296
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,840
Call the police!

297
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
Where's the tape?

298
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,120
What tape?

299
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,240
The video!

300
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,680
Video.

301
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,360
Over there, for sale.

302
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,320
Oh, my God.

303
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,520
Free!

304
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,800
There are too many
innocent people down there.

305
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,160
There he goes! After him !

306
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,760
What's going on?

307
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,160

Let's get up there!

310
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,960
Right.

311
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,120
Look out!

312
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,280
Move it!

313
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,680
There he is!

00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,280
Faster! Go!

315
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,280
Excuse me!

316

319
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,240
Yikes!

320
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,840
Out! Move!

321
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,240
What do you want with that guy?

322
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,720
He's got a videotape
that exposes us all.

323
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,720
Wait!

324
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,440
Thief! l'm gonna--

325
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,240
Wait! l can explain.

326
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,480
You can explain it to the cops.

327
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,000
l'm not a thief.

328
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,200
l'm looking for something
that belongs to me.

329
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,480
Uh-huh.

330
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,680
l got it right here.

331
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,120
Enough, you psycho!

332
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,320
Stop! Stop!
You're trashing my place!

333
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,720
lt's not my fault.
She's doing the trashing.

334
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,800
And now l'm going
to trash your butt!

335
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,800
Wait!

336
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,520
Stop it!

337
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,400
Look at my place.

338
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,960
How could you do this
after l saved your life?

339
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,440
l'm sorry.

340
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,560
Look, l dropped a videotape
in your car yesterday...

341
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,640
and l have to get it back.

342
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,080
That must be the video
the gangsters wanted.

343
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,680
You didn't give it to them,
did you?

344
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,760
Good. Just give it to me.

345
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,920
l don't have it.

346
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,560
-What?
-What?

347
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,640
You have to,
because when l got home...

348
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,480
l had one of
your stupid cooking videos.

349
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Stupid?

350
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,640
Sorry.

351
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,120
Please.

352
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,920
l've got to have that tape.

353
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,520
l'll do anything.

354
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,800
l'll bet you will.

355
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
What do you mean, do anything?

356
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
lf l had the tape,
l would give it to you.

357
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,240
You should go to the police.

358
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,160
l'd be happy to take her.

359
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,720
Please just go.

360
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,840
You don't understand--

361
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,320
l understand. l know.

362
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,640
My vase?

363
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,040
Sorry.

364
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,960
lt's OK. l can fix it.

365
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Jackie, if you could
just help me.

366
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,040
You're my last hope--

367
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,520
They're coming to kill me.

368
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,640
What?

369
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,480
Hurry up! Hurry up!

370
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,120
You were right.

371
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,520
ls there another way out?

372
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,480
Yes. Follow me.

373
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,000
Every time l see you,
it's trouble.

374
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,200
This way.

375
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,320
Wait.

376
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,480
Be careful.

377
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,240
Wait.

378
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,600
Wait for me.

379
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,440
This is the other way out?

380
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,880
Yeah. Are you scared?

381
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,160
Sorry.

382
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,840
Go.

383
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,000

384
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,640
Giancarlo needs that tape.

385
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,760
lt's bonus time.

386
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,200
That's what l'm talking about.

387
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,320
Shit!

388
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,160
Shit. Shit.

389
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,520
-Need any help?
-No.

390
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,520
-OK. See you later.
-OK.

391
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,360
Why did you stop?

392
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,840
l'm afraid of heights!

393
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,240
Come on!

394
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Listen.

395
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,720
Look straight.

396
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,560
Now what?

397
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,720
Close your eyes.

398
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,920
Now what?

399
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,600
Well done!

400
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,520
All right, Giancarlo.
Payback time.

401
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,640
l'll check in here.

402
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,200
Hang on!

403
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,600
That's the guy
that's got the tape.

404
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,280
Come on.

405
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
l'll arrange a safe house
for you all to stay in.

406
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,520
You mean like a jail?
No, thanks.

407
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,320
Jackie, I know you can take care of yourself,
but what about the others?

408
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,480
Hey, l'm sticking with Jackie
until l get my tape back.

409
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,960
Where are you going to stay?

410
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,840
Anywhere...
like Lakeisha's place.

411
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,560
What? My place?

412
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,040
Any problem with that?

413
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,640
No problem.

414
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,440
You're all welcome.

415
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,800
See? No problem.

416
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,520
Jackie, be careful.

417
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,160
Gentlemen,
you asked for a meeting.

418
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,240
We need that cocaine shipment.

419
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,000
We've lost a lot of business.

420
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,720
There's no product to sell.

421
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,600
How can l keep my men
if l can't pay them?

422
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,200
People don't respect us anymore.

423
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
The Vietnamese are moving in
on our territory.

424
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,800
Damn it, Giancarlo,
you've got to do something.

425
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,760
Soon, we'll have nothing left.

426
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,040
Gentlemen,
thank you for your concern...

427
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,120
but l assure you
business will continue as usual.

428
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,320
You may go.

429
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,080
Keeps his house so clean
you can't even fart.

430
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,160
Sorry. We didn't get the tape,
and four guys got blown up.

431
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,640
What?

432
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,560
Either l get the tape,
or you'll never be seen again!

433
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,080
Let me do that.

434
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,440
Thank you.

435
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,040
Yes, yes. That feels good.

436
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,280
What is she saying?

437
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,880
She just wants
to buy some clothes.

438
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,400
Not a problem.

439
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,920
She's a bit smaller
than me, but...

440
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,200
l've got something
that should fit her just fine.

441
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,960
What are you talking about?

442
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,000
She said,
"Thank you for your generosity."

443
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,960
Come with me.

444
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,240
Don't be shy.

445
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,280
Think.

446
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,760
Did you go anywhere else
yesterday?

447
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,200
Get over here.

448
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,320
-Who are you?
-Where's the tape?

449
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh, my God.
You want the tape, too?

450
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,720
lf you find it, please take it!

451
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,880
Find it!

452
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,360
Just don't hurt anyone.

453
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,520
Hey, who are you?

454
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,920
Cops!

455
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,240
-What's the matter with you?
-Bathroom.

456
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,160
-Just hold it.
-OK.

457
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,040
-Don't try anything funny now.
-l won't.

458
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,160
Cops! Come on, let's go.

459
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,400
Take her!

460
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,720
The phone is gonna ring
in 12 hours.

461
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,240
Be ready to trade.

462
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,080
What happened?

463
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,840
They took Miki.

464
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,400
All units,
this is Captain Morrison.

465
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,800
Don't anyone make a move
without my order.

466
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,240
Listen up.

467
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,480
Stay out of sight
until the hostage is safe.

468
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,080
So you got the tape?

469
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,880

548
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,960
Hey, you!

549
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,800

-Somebody need help?
-Yeah, you!

552

Are you sure this
is the right tape?

lt's the right tape.

560
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,600
Let her go.

561
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,640
lf you're jerking us around...

562
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,320
you and your girlfriend
are in trouble.

563
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,440
We got the tape.

564
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,840
Let's call Giancarlo
and set up a meeting.

565
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,960
Boss, there's a phone call
for you.

566
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,520
We've got your tape
and the cocaine.

567
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,800
Meet us at the Golden Garden
construction site in an hour.

568
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,280
The price is doubled.

569
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,480
Thank you very much.

570
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,920
Take the tape.

571
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,960
None of my business.
None of my business.

572
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,840
What are you doing?

573
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,000
Watch the knife.

574
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,640
Where is my girlfriend?

575
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,280
Where is she?

576
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,440
Say it!

577
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,760
At the Golden Garden
construction site.

578
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,080
-Jackie.
-Let me go!

579
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,320
Tell me what happened!

580
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,120
Just let me go!

581
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,680
Let him go, let him go.

582
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,520
There's Jackie. Stop.

583
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,760
l didn't do nothing!

584
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,880
Police brutality!

585
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,480
You're all my eyewitnesses!

586
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,080
Go on. Hit me, somebody.

587
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,240
My pleasure!

588
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,440
Here we go, then.

589
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,880
He hit me. You see that?

590
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,960
And your mother, too!

591
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,120
Let's go.

592
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,720
You two stay here.

593
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,840
Wait.

594
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,680
l think that what--

595
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,560
Touch her again...

596
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,600
and l cut 'em off.

597
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,640
Where's my girlfriend?

598
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,800
We'll waste you, Demons!

599
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,720
Giancarlo's men! Run!

600
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,000
You're a pretty one.

601
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,640
Where's my cocaine?

602
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,200
Quick! Over here!

603
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,320
Where's the tape?
And where's my cocaine?

604
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,760
l don't have the tape!

605
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,560
What happens to us
if l tell you?

606
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,600
You're free to go.

607
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,040
You have my word.

608
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,840
Two crates...

609
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,960
in that room.

610
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,400
We found it!

611
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,160
She's all yours, boys.

612
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,440
Go! Save yourself!

613
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,880
Run!

614
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,080
What happened?

615
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,000
The girl--she got away.

616
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,480
Who cares?

617
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,440
Boss, the Chinese cook...

618
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,200
he's upstairs.

619
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,240
The Chinese cook?

620
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,240
So who are you?

621
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,600
l'm Miki.

622
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,480
Jackie's my boyfriend.

623
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,760
Oh, Jackie.
Well, how about that?

624
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,480
l must be living right.

625
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,400
Take her!

626
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,960
Put that in the car.

627
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,280
Stand over there.

628
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,520
You're gonna get us killed.

629
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,840
Lakeisha,
you're my star witness.

630
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,200
l'll get help.

631
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,960
Don't hit me!

632
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,920
That way!

633
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,400
Grab one!

634
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,280
Throw her over.

635
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,160
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

636
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,480
You heard the man. He said no.

637
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,160
Put her down.

638
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,120
Finally, we meet.

639
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,960
Try not to get any dirt
on my car.

640
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,120
Go!

641
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,800
Daddy!

642
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,960
Come here, hmm?

643
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,560
What's so interesting on TV?

644
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,480
What's the world coming to
when a businessman...

645
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,480
has to pay to buy back
his own stuff?

646
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,680
Your stuff, huh?

647
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,160
Where'd you get the tape?

648
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,200
At Grandpa's house.
Uncle Jackie brought it.

649
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,200
-They got the girls.
-What?

650
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,040
-They've taken them hostage.
-Are they hurt bad?

651
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,400
l don't know.
We've got units standing by.

652
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,360
You better get down here.

653
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,320
l'm on my way.

654
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,400
This is all the information
we have on Giancarlo.

655
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,760
-Thanks. l owe you one.
-l won't forget.

656
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,920
l can't even sit?

657
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,120
Look at you.

658
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,520
The boss is very meticulous
about his home.

659
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,520
Hand over the tape.

660
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,960
l don't have it!

661
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,600
Leave him alone!

662
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,880
-lt's at my friend's.
-So call him.

663
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,720
Come on, Romeo.
Answer the phone.

664
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,080
Where are you?

665
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,640
Hi. lt's Jackie.

666
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,560
Remember the tape l gave you?

667
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,120
You haven't seen it? Good.

668
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,400
Can you bring it to me?

669
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,600
Address?

670
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,520
What's the address?

671
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,400
Anybody know the address?

672
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,240
They won't tell me.

673
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,360
l'll come get it. Yes.

674
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,200
See you later.
Don't go anywhere.

675
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,240
l'll be there soon.

676
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,400
OK.

677
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,080
He found the tape,
but l have to go get it.

678
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,520
See you soon.

679
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,840
You like to play games?

680
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,920
Fine.

681
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,600
Let's play one of mine.

682
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,080
The judge is looking
at the tape right now.

683
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,000
We're close
to breaking this wide open.

684
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,600
l don't want a loose cannon
jeopardizing the case...

685
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,040
so l'm here to make sure
there are no more screwups.

686
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,960
Now, l want you to cool down.

687
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,080
Well, here's your chance.

688
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,480
Show me what you got.

689
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,920
Real sweet punch.

690
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,320
Almost got me.

691
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,280
What am l paying you idiots for?

692
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,520
He almost got me that time!

693
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,040
Don't mind the ropes.

694
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,240
Take your best shot.

695
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,800
Don't spit in my house.

696
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,840
No, no! Don't pull!

697
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,040
No! Pull!

698
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,200
Useless!

699
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,160
ldiot!

700
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,320
-Boss!
-What?

701
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,920
Luigi and the others,
they're here.

702
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,440
Forget the damn tape.

703
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,280
Take him to the guesthouse!

704
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,560
Out of the way!

705
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,800
Yes, boss.

706
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,920
Luigi.

707
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,120
They might as well
give us condoms.

708
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,200
Take the girls over there.

709
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,760
l'll look after this one.

710
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,560
Look out!

711
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,520
Get in!

712
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,360
Quick, quick, quick!

713
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,840
Look out!

714
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,760
Get out!

715
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,720
Remember, stay cool.

716
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,040
What do you want?

717
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,720
We want to see Giancarlo.

718
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,720
Maybe he doesn't want
to see you.

719
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,920
That kind of rudeness
simply will not be tolerated.

720
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,640
You wish to see me?

721
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,480
Captain Morrison, NEA.

722
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,960
This is Romeo Baggio.

723
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,720
Where's Jackie?

724
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,520
lf you've done anything to him--

725
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,320
l have no idea
who you're talking about.

726
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,600
ls your name Jackie?

727
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,880
You Jackie?

728
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,600
l know you.

729
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,440
You're the city's
biggest drug lords.

730
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,080
l told you to cool it!

731
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,520
You have any evidence?

732
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,120
You know the law.

733
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,720
l could shoot you like a dog
for trespassing...

734
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,320
so why don't you just leave?

735
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,720
Relax.

736
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,160
Let's get out of here.

737
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,560
Come on. Let's go.

738
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,520
Can you believe those two?

739
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,960
That Romeo's got
some big brass ones.

740
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,080
He better be careful...

741
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,680
or he'll find them hung
on his Christmas tree.

742
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,960
What's that doing here?

743
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,480
Hey, it's Jackie.

744
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,920
l know it's Jackie.

745
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,520
