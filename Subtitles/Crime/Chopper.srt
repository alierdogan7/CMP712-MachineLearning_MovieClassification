00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,000
There's something fucking
desperately wrong with him and...

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
...he needs fucking help.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Good luck to him, good luck to him
and anyone that's helping him...

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because he's fucked... i'm telling you.

5
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:36,961
Neville Bartos has
been in hiding since...

6
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:41,306
Chopper shot and narrowly missed
killing him for the second time.

7
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:42,779
You see that's a good bloody wound.

8
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,600
— Do you see that?
— Of course I bloody can!

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,400
...I let him in,
I said hello, I was a friend.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,000
- And he did it again...
- That's right!

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,800
So what have you got to
say to people who say...

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,000
"He's a real bad piece of work,
he's criminally insane."

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
- Who says that?
- Well Neville Bartos for one.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,400
That bloody sook!

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,600
Is he still crying is he?

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,225
Neville shouldn't have stepped
into the criminal world unless...

17
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:09,992
he was prepared to
put body on the line.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,200
The average man on the street
doesn't worry about Chopper Read.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,000
The average man on the street, he likes
me, he couldn't care less about me.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What I do, he applauds.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And now they're saying...

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
the proceeds of my bullshit should
go to these victims of crime.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Who are my victims?
Proceeds of crime!

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Do you wanna see money go to the
drug dealers? I perish the thought.

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,200
I ain't got nothing on my
conscience for killing a few druggies.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,000
The drugs are far as i'm concerned...

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,400
they completely the criminal world...

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
And in my opinion they'll
probably ruin normal society.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,200
That's right, that's what he said before.

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,400
You seem to have a hatred for humanity.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
Humanity doesn't like me. That's
why i'm always sitting here talking.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,800
I'm a bloody freak show.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,600
He's waving at us!

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Chopper!
He's waving at us!

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,000
The average person watching
this thinks i'm a bloody freak.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,200
What's your opinion?

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm just a normal bloke, a normal
bloke that likes a bit of torture!

38
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
You see that line there?
That's your side of the yard.

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,600
You stay that side of the
yard, we'll stay this side.

40
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
Good, you got that knucklehead?

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,200
What's he done to his hair?

42
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,400
That's boot polish mate. 
Lynx forgot to pick up the powder.

43
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Poor old bugger.

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Nice to see your bald
patch has gone Keith.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It looks good mate.

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,000
I like it.

47
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
So you're not gonna get me then Keith?

48
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,000
Not worth doing any
more time over you maggot.

49
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Keithy, you'll get off on self defence.

50
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
All you gotta do is kill me...

51
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,600
present my psychiatric
records to the court...

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,800
There's not a jury in the
land that'll convict you.

53
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
You fucking sick, Read.
You're insane.

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,600
Beethoven had his critics too Keith.

55
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
See if you can name 3 of them.

56
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
That's right, you can't.

57
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:12,126
Why don't you do yourself a
favour and shut up you cunt.

58
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:14,154
You're a parrot, fucking blowfly!

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ah Keith, I always
thought I was a good bloke.

60
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
- What did you ever do that was good?
- Well I bashed you.

61
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,600
That was good, wasn't it? It was
good for a bit of a giggle anyway.

62
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Hey Keithy?

63
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:30,446
Come on Keith,
you should thank me.

64
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,438
You're gonna hit the knees
doing regular panel beating.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,800
Fuck him, who does he think he is?

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He knows who he is.
He's Keithy George.

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,000
He's the painters and dockers mate.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Out there he's the
painters and dockers.

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
In here he's just another
bare bum in the shower.

70
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
Why do you hate him so much?

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't hate him,
I don't hate anybody.

72
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
Well why have we been
fighting for 3 fucking years?

73
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
I don't know.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,600
- Mate, we should have a reason.
- We'll make one up.

75
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Over here.

76
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,000
Step in, Mark.

77
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,600
Mr. Cole?

78
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
What the fuck's
going on down there?

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,400
Keithy's done himself a mischief.

80
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Hurry up!

81
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,400
I'll be on down in a minute.

82
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,800
You alright Keith?

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,600
It's alright Keith, you're not
going to bleed to death.

84
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,800
They called the screws.
The screws are coming.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,600
- Want a cigarette Keith?
- Get away from me!

86
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
It's alright mate.

87
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,800
Have a cigarette Keith.

88
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Keithy, come on mate.

89
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,800
You don't much like me do you?

90
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
You bash people for no reason
just to make a name for yourself.

91
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
You're a fucking idiot.

92
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not a dumb cumless piece of blood Keith.

93
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm the one who runs a division.

94
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,800
Make no mistake about that.

95
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
What's going on here?

96
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,400
No sweat.

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Keithy seems to have
done himself a mischief.

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Stay back fellas!
Keep everyone away!

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
Alright Keithy?

100
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,200
Off you go mate.
Off to the sickbay.

101
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
Whinge, whinge, fucking whinge!

102
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,600
Nice late one tonight sir.

103
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
I don't mind Mark,
I get double pay.

104
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,800
- Bit of overtime?
- It'll do me.

105
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Enjoy.

106
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
Bloody put my shoulder out.

107
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,200
What?

108
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,600
This is DSS Creswell, DS Wyatt.

109
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,000
They're from the
prisoner liaison office.

110
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,140
They're investigating the
incident that happened in...

111
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,693
H division yesterday
involving prisoner George.

112
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,800
At this stage I must inform you that
you're not obliged to say anything...

113
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,800
And anything you do say may
be given in evidence, understand?

114
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,200
All I can tell you is
what I told Mr Beazley.

115
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,200
None of us saw anything,
it's just one of those things.

116
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,800
Bluey Barnes was reading a magazine...

117
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,400
Ambrose Atcheson was taking a piss...

118
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
Johnny Price was washing his hands...

119
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,000
Jimmy Loughnan was watching a
bull ant crawl  across the table...

120
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,600
And I was watching
Jimmy watch the bull ant.

121
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:25,265
Sadly, none of us are gonna be
able to help you on this occasion...

122
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:26,280
as much as we'd like to.

123
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,800
I put it to you that that's not the truth.

124
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,600
Look, I didn't stab Keithy George.

125
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I had nothing to do with what
happened to Keithy George, alright.

126
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,448
And i'm sure when he
wakes from his slumber...

127
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:43,200
he'll swear to God
that I didn't stab him.

128
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,400
He's not gonna wake up Mark,
he died this morning.

129
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
It's not a good thing.

130
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
The sort of thing
that'll come back at you.

131
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,800
Don't get all spooky on me.

132
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,883
I'll dream about that
shit for a while, big deal.

133
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:10,953
I'll keep my feet on the ground.

134
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,400
That's not what he's talking about,
he's talking about the dockers

135
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
They have to get us
back now don't they?

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
What do you want me to do about it?

137
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,200
Just fucking lie there while
he's stabbing me to death?

138
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
That would've been wise wouldn't it?

139
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,000
We didn't want to start it up
again, this is fucking whack!

140
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
That's the fucking whack!

141
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Bluey!

142
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
Get fucked!

143
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,600
About bloody time Blue!

144
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Don't get angry Blue. You lose your
edge you lose your perspective.

145
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,200
You can't make friends with your enemies.

146
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,800
Even when peace time is declared,
they're all still fucking enemies.

147
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,200
Aren't they?

148
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,800
No one's ever forgotten Blue,
it's just human fucking nature.

149
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,600
My money's always been on you Mark.

150
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,200
The dockers are very threatened at
what's happened to Keithy George.

151
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
You've really put them in a corner.

152
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
I don't know how
serious to take this but...

153
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,400
There's a rumour going around that
they've put a contract out on you.

154
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
How much?

155
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
That's been passed round,
5 of the dockers have put in...

156
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
$2,000 each to have you knocked.

157
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,600
Not bad. I should have a go myself.

158
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,600
It all sounds a liitle ridiculous doesn't it?
Who are they gonna get to do it?

159
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
Take you pick Mark.

160
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,800
All we gotta do is grab two screws...

161
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,600
knives to their throats, take their keys,
march them up to the scullery...

162
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
lock them in the scullery.

163
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Then get matchsticks,
stick them in the keyholes...

164
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,200
seperating the gates
from the divison, right?

165
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,400
Then we ring the alarm bells...

166
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,800
We pick up the phone to Governer Beazley...

167
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
And we tell him we've
got two screws hostage...

168
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
and we've taken the
entire division to siege.

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,600
Then we'll grab the keys, go
through the whole joint, cell by cell...

170
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,000
and I will icepick the fucking spines
of every prisoner in this division.

171
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,400
Make paraplegics of all of them.

172
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,600
Turn them all into jelly sandwiches.

173
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
- I don't wanna be in it.
- Are you a girl's dress.

174
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,800
I don't care what you say.

175
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
The blokes down there haven't got
$10,000. They haven't got 10,000 cents.

176
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
They haven't got
any sense at all mate.

177
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,800
It's simple, we do it all in
one night. We go swoop...

178
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,000
Wake up in the morning, problem solved.

179
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,000
I've got my appeal going.
I don't wanna fuck it up.

180
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,000
You'll be in it though won't you?

181
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
Do I have to remind
you of certain things?

182
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,400
- You're never gonna let me forget
that fucking judge are you? - No.

183
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,000
And as for you, you knucklehead...

184
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,400
When it starts you jump straight in.

185
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,200
If you stand there thinking about it for
two fucking seconds you are back there...

186
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
In the yard, crying, like
when I first met you. Right?

187
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:21,214
Yeah.

188
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,476
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

189
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Want a smoke?

190
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
Ta Jimmy.

191
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:37,645
Anyway, Swallow didn't come out.

192
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,022
He said to wait till the next morning.

193
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,800
So I was thinking mate,
I saw him in the dunny...

194
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,400
He was there with the
toothpick trying to go at it.

195
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,200
It's a bit early in the morning
for kung-fu isn't it Jim?

196
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,600
What's the matter with you?

197
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,800
Hang on a second.

198
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
What are you doing?

199
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,200
What's got into you?

200
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,400
Come here mate.

201
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
Sorry, Chop.

202
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
It's alright.

203
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Shit!

204
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,400
Jim if you keep stabbing me
you're gonna kill me, right?

205
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,800
You can let go.

206
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,400
I can't let you go Jimmy,
you've got a knife in your hand.

207
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You let me go i'll drop that shiv.

208
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,800
You drop the knife
and then i'll let you go.

209
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,000
You let me go i'll drop the shiv, i'll drop off.

210
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,600
Let go of the knife Jimmy.

211
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,800
Ok i'll drop off, let go of my hands.

212
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,800
I'm gonna let you go, ok?
Go and sit down.

213
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Terrific sneak Jim, bloody terrific.

214
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
You obviously listened
and learnt well didn't you?

215
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,600
Always give credit where credit is due.

216
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,600
I give you top marks for treachery.

217
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,000
Blue, you're bloody useless.

218
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,800
You alright Chop?

219
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,400
Yeah i'm alright.

220
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,800
- Jesus mate, does it hurt?
- No.

221
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,800
I think you'd better lie down..

222
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
What for?

223
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,800
It'll do you good mate.

224
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,400
Come on let me help out,
you'd better lie down and lie still.

225
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,600
Just like that.

226
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Sorry Chop.

227
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Sorry.

228
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,400
- Cut me. - No, I can't
fucking cut you mate!

229
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,600
Bluey, cut me!

230
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
I can't cut you mate.

231
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
- I can't do it.
- Pussy fucker...

232
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,800
- Put the knife down.
- He's a madman, he attacked me.

233
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Put the knife down.

234
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,200
- Ok, he attacked me first.
- Put the knife down.

235
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,800
We're not letting anyone out of
here until the knife goes on the table.

236
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,600
- He's a psycho, just get him out of here.
- Put it on the table Jim!

237
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
Put it down!

238
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,200
Chopper went fucking mad!
He fucking tried to stab Jimmy.

239
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,800
He attacked him first.

240
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
He attacked me first boss, right?

241
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,400
How about getting someone
to look at my arm?

242
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,600
How are you Mark?

243
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Are you prepared
to make a statement?

244
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,800
The bloke's been my
best mate since 1975.

245
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,400
We've had our fallouts from
time to time, that's no big deal.

246
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,400
If your mum stabs you what do you do?

247
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,600
You don't get upset,
you don't get angry.

248
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
You go "Shit, mum's stabbed me,
i'd better get to the hospital."

249
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,600
He's made a statement against you Mark.

250
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
No he hasn't.

251
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,000
Have a look at that.

252
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,200
That's not Jimmy,
Jimmy wouldn't do that.

253
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
He's done it.

254
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
He's also filed a claim with the
victims of crime compensation board.

255
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,800
Victims of crime,
how much can he get?

256
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
$5,000.

257
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,800
Jimmy Loughnan,
a bloody victim fo crime?!

258
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Shit. Cheeky dog!

259
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,000
If he's charged...

260
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Does that mean I can
lay a claim against him?

261
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,800
Is that you Jimmy?

262
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
You weak cunt!

263
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,600
You coulda had me but you lost
your guts at the last second didn't ya?

264
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,200
I tell you Jim,
if i'd had had the knife...

265
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
you wouldn't have got a stab in the
arm, i'd have cut your fucking head off!

266
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,000
Mark, why you
ganging up against Jim?

267
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,400
He's the one who made the
first statement against me.

268
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Cops were gonna charge me
with attempted murder...

269
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,600
because of a statement made by
Jimmy, my-lips-are-sealed Loughnan.

270
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,200
The prick even filed a victims
of crime compo claim against me.

271
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,400
But he's the one who's
been charged Mark.

272
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,000
You can't stand up in court against him.

273
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,600
Who do you think I am
blue? The Red Cross?

274
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I'm not running some public charity here.

275
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,800
Mark, you know i've always
had a lot of time for you but...

276
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,600
Jimmy's the one who's been charged.

277
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,600
I think the main thing,
you know Mark...

278
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Is that Jim doesn't get
more jail out of this.

279
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,200
"Jimmy doesn't get any
more jail out of this"

280
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,800
Well he'd better get himself a
real fucking lawyer then hadn't he?.

281
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,400
The matter of the police
versus James Richard Loughnan.

282
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,200
Mrs Newman is appearing
for the prosecution.

283
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,800
The defendant is not represented.

284
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Mr Read, have you been searched prior to
your appearance in this courtroom today?

285
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah, by all and sundry.
Everyone's had a go at it.

286
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,200
And why do you think that is Mr Read?

287
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,800
Well they search everyone,
especially you Mr Loughnan.

288
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,000
I put it to you that the reason
you were searched so thoroughly...

289
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,200
is because you have a history of
violent behaviour in courtrooms.

290
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Are you not currently serving
of 14 and a half years...

291
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,000
for the attempted
abduction of a judge?

292
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,200
That's 16 and a half years Jimmy.

293
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,800
16 and a half years.

294
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm told you used a shotgun in this
attempted abduction, is that so?

295
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Yeah, I had it right
here under my coat.

296
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
- There ain't nothing don't there now.
- I wish there was.

297
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,800
I bet you do. Who would you
like to use it on? This judge?

298
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,600
No, i'd use it on you at the moment.

299
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Yeah, I bet you would.
You hold human life very cheaply?

300
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Some human life yeah.

301
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
You have a lot of hostility
towards me don't you?

302
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,600
No, I perish the thought. I even lent
you that suit you're wearing today.

303
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,200
You lent him that suit?

304
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,600
Yeah, I realise it's not a
fashion competition your honour,

305
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
but if he'd have worn
what he was gonna wear,

306
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,200
you'd have given him
20 years for bad taste.

307
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,000
I am a friend of yours am I not?

308
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
It's been alleged that you are.

309
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,200
And you are in fact serving
a sentence of 17 years...

310
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,600
because you tried to free
me from jail, is that so?

311
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,200
Yes.

312
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,800
And yet you've told the court that I
attacked you on the morning of August 20?

313
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
- Is that right?
- Yes.

314
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
Why would I attack you Mr Read?

315
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,800
Who knows how your mind works Jim.

316
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,600
So all the people we've
heard in court today,

317
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,400
some of them you consider
to be your friends,

318
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
they're all telling lies?

319
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,000
Just a group of people banding
together to find a common enemy.

320
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,800
- Even your friends?
- Oh yeah.

321
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,600
Armed police surrounded
Brunswick court today during...

322
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,000
a case involving notorious
criminal Mark Brandon Read.

323
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,600
Read was giving evidence in the communal
proceedings of fellow prisoner James...

324
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Figure this out Blue.

325
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,400
I'm the one on trial, he's
the one all over the news.

326
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,000
That's a nice little photo of you Jimmy...

327
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,400
A nice little photo.

328
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,600
You are sucha  fucking
show pony, aren't you?

329
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,400
You could use that in your passport.

330
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,800
You fucking bighead wanker!

331
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,200
Keithy was right about you mate.

332
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
You bash people for no reason
just to get a name for yourself.

333
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,200
Well one day they'll write
a book about me Jimmy.

334
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,200
And when you grow old and your
grandchildren ask you did in your heyday...

335
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,800
you'll be able to say,
with great pride...

336
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,800
that you couldn't kill Mark Chopper
Read. That'll be your claim to fame.

337
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,000
You ever used a fucking gun Jimmy?

338
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You hear that Chopper?

339
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,200
You're dead no mate,
you've got no friends left.

340
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
You think I fucking give a shit?!

341
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,000
Now if you could just see it in your
hearts to move me to Sale.

342
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,800
I'd be really appreciative.

343
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,200
Geelong's a dirty old hole.

344
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,200
Come on Mark, you're classified
as a maximum security prisoner.

345
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
You're in here convicted
of a very serious offence.

346
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,000
I suppose a bribe's
out of the question?

347
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,200
Mark, this is not a joke.

348
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,400
I'm not joking, i'll be getting
$5,000 crimes compo...

349
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,000
When Jimmy and I finish
up at the supreme court.

350
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
Look Mark, a bribe
is out of the question.

351
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,400
- You're not going anywhere.
- But if I stay in here i'm dead.

352
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,600
Well i'm sorry about that
but nothing can be done.

353
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,200
Mr Beazley?

354
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Mr Beazley.

355
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,400
Righto, i'm out of H Division today.

356
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
You're not going anywhere Mark.

357
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,400
Let's go!

358
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Don't saw at it!

359
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm trying to be gentle mate.

360
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,600
You fucking idiot!

361
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,400
Rip into it!
Slash it off!

362
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,800
Don't do it!

363
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
The other one.

364
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,600
You're not gonna
get me for this later?

365
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,800
Just get on with it you
fucking fairy, rip into it!

366
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,200
Good fucking job Mark.

367
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,000
Get a screw would ya.

368
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,600
- You're fucking bleeding Chop!
- Boss!

369
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,482
You've gotta stop the bleeding, ok?

370
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:21,005
You're gonna need cold water, you're
gonna get yourself into the shower.

371
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:22,600
You're talking to me now eh?

372
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
After all i've done for you.

373
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,000
I took you from tears to fucking
glory and you do this to me!

374
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm not angry at you Jim, you
just broke my heart, that's all.

375
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,000
What's going on?

376
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,400
Chopper cut his fucking ears off!

377
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,400
Not gonna get out of H divison eh?

378
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,800
You practically ran
down and carried me out.

379
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,400
Haven't ya? Look at ya.

380
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,400
Get him out!

381
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,400
I told you i'd get out didn't I?
Have a look who's leaving!

382
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Get him out!

383
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,200
It's no big deal boss, they can
be bloody sewed to the nines.

384
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,400
You're looking at
my ears aren't you?

385
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,000
Well you weren;t thinking of me
when you did that were you?

386
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,600
I missed you Bub.

387
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Did you?

388
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,400
I'm out of it now, right?
I made it as a top street fighter.

389
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,400
I made it as a top criminal, i've
got nothing to prove any further.

390
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,000
You gotta keep moving
forward otherwise you'll perish.

391
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,200
There's no point going backwards,
you gotta keep going forwards.

392
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
Give me your arm.

393
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,000
No my left arm.

394
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,200
Shut up!

395
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,000
Give me your arm.

396
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,600
- You know I hate it like that.
- It's just a bit of goey.

397
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,000
You alright?

398
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Hey you there?
Hang on, i'll check.

399
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You've given up crime eh?

400
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,400
Mark? Is that you?

401
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,200
Oh dad sorry, you're asleep.

402
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,200
Come in here Mark.

403
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
No you're alright,
you go to sleep dad.

404
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,400
Come in here. You haven't been out for
10 years. Where've you been all day?

405
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,600
You look tired dad,
you go back to sleep.

406
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,400
No, get in here. Get in here
and talk to your old dad.

407
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,400
You've been away for 10 years.

408
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,000
I've been sitting here waiting all day
for you. Don't sit there, sit over here.

409
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Sit over here in this chair.

410
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200
I've been sitting around
all day waiting for you.

411
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,600
Do you want a drink?

412
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Good to have you home son.

413
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Cheers big ears!

414
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,400
Nice shirt son.

415
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,200
What's wrong with it?

416
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,400
Nothing, it's good, I like it.

417
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,400
- You like it?
- Do they make 'em for men?

418
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Don't be a sook.

419
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,400
I wrote to mum.
Told her I was getting out.

420
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,800
Did you here anything from her?

421
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
No.

422
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,600
Of course you didn't.

423
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,400
I heard your mate
Jimmy Loughnan's at large.

424
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
That old chestnut.

425
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,800
He beat the charge.
I always told you Mark:

426
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Your kindness'll be the death of you.

427
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,200
He's fucked dad, he's
a bloody chronic junkie.

428
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Your mate.

429
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Life got him back in the end,
it all bloody equals out.

430
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, equals out alright! He stabs you in
the gut and he gets off, you do 10 years.

431
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,600
All equals out... Your mate
Jimmy, Jimmy Loughnan.

432
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Fuck it.

433
00:34:14,598 --> 00:34:17,874
No lovey, you walk on the inside,
gentlemen walks on the outside.

434
00:34:17,874 --> 00:34:19,057
It's called etiquette.

435
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:19,934
Oh yeah?
Haven't heard that one before.

436
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,400
It's from the days when
there were strong characters...

437
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Mud used to splach
up from the gutter.

438
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,200
Just in case any mud splashes
up i'm here to protect you.

439
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,600
Are you? Thanks sweetheart.

440
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,381
Piss off! You're blocking the entrance.

441
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Chopper!

442
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Good to see you out mate!

443
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Good to see you mate, looking great.

444
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,200
- Keeo it down fellas.
- What?

445
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Just saying it's good
to see you out mate.

446
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,800
It's like wearing a fucking sign on
me with you carrying on like that.

447
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:50,891
We're just happy to see you out.

448
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:52,800
Out and around.

449
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,400
Good to see me is it?

450
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,000
Have a good night.

451
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
G'day Chopper,
I heard you were out.

452
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,400
Are you kidding me?
You've forgotten?

453
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,600
No no, you're fucking kidding me!

454
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,400
Fuck, Neville.

455
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,000
That's right mate, you
got it in one. Neville fucking Bartos.

456
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,400
You see he did fucking
remember, of course he did.

457
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,400
What was it mate?
What was it you forgot?

458
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,600
How are you Nev? Are you good?

459
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
What do you reckon?
Take a fucking look.

460
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,000
Have a fucking look,
of course i'm fucking good.

461
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,400
Listen Nev, about the leg...

462
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,400
I'm sorry mate, it bloody upsets
me, it plays on my mind a bit.

463
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,400
That was 10 years ago, it's water
under the bridge, just forget about it.

464
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,200
No seriously, forget about it.

465
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,000
Because i've forgotten about
it so don't worry about it.

466
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,200
Plus i've a victim's compo
payout, pension awsell eh.

467
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,600
Big bloody payout eh?
And not a drink in it for me...

468
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,200
Not even a fucking thank you card.

469
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,600
No, you got me there.

470
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,000
What are you drinking?
I'll get you a fucking bottle.

471
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Because what's mine is yours.

472
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,600
- Would your girl like a drink?
- Marsala and Coke.

473
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,000
Marsala and Coke, good choice.

474
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,400
Nick, I need some drinks over here quick.

475
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I want a bottle of Marsala and
a bottle of Coke, and for you?

476
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,600
Beer.

477
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Get us a couple of
beers too Nick, quick.

478
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:17,349
Bloody look at him!

479
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:19,861
Putting on that limp trying to
get me to feel sorry for him.

480
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Seemed alright.
Seems quite genuine.

481
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Well you would think he was genuine,
the way he staring into your eyes.

482
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,400
No Mark.

483
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,400
Fucking cripple!

484
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
Don't worry about that.

485
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,800
Don't worry about it.

486
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,400
He's done very bloddy
well for himself too, hasn't he?

487
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
Mark... leave him alone.

488
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,400
Fuck, i've gotta nip this in the bud.

489
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,400
Mark, don't...

490
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,600
You're not still shit at
me about that leg are you?

491
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,800
You're not still angry at
me about that leg are you?

492
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Forget about it.

493
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,400
I don't know if you remember Neville but
I had that shotgun pointed at your head.

494
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,600
I was really considerate dropping
down to your kneecap remember?

495
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Forget about it, alright?

496
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,200
What the hell were you doing
getting lippy with me with a shotgun?

497
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,400
The leg is ok, alright?
Look at me.

498
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm flying.

499
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
Go back to your girl, relax.

500
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,200
Forget the leg, i'll get
you another drink, alright?

501
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,400
Chop Chop, how you doing?

502
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,000
Who was that?

503
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,600
He wanted a light.

504
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Just leave it,
don't worry about it.

505
00:39:24,658 --> 00:39:26,891
You look at me or you
look straight ahead...

506
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:28,435
you don't make eye contact
with anyone, alright?

507
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,600
What was that for?

508
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,400
Come on, we're going.

509
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,200
Fuck off Mark!

510
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,000
Get your fucking jacket.

511
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,200
I'm not going anywhere,
let go of me Mark!

512
00:39:46,203 --> 00:39:47,631
Put her on a leash mate.

513
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
- What are you looking at hop-a-long?
- Nothing mate.

514
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
You got a problem you fucking cripple!

515
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,800
No pronblem between you and me.

516
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
You wanna fucking finish it?

517
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm sorry baby.

518
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,400
I get a bit bloody schizo or something.

519
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,600
It's not easy you know, if I go out
everyone's staring at my ears...

520
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,000
staring at my tattoos, you know?

521
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,000
I've done some bad things but...

522
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I've done some bad things.

523
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,200
Now i've got a bloody team of enemies.

524
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,000
You should lay off the speed.

525
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,600
I'm trying to think of the last time...

526
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,800
I actually took
some time to be normal.

527
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,000
Stood there and looked at a
bloody sunset or go to a bloody bar.

528
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I can't go to a bar, I can't
have a relaxed bloody meal.

529
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I can't go to a restaurant
and have a relaced bloody meal.

530
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,800
I've gotta sit with my back against
the wall in case someone comes in.

531
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,600
My luck can't last forever.

532
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,800
I'll get us some money together.

533
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,600
I've got some money coming in.

534
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,400
Let's say you and I
go down to Tasmania...

535
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,600
and me make our
own bloody life together?

536
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,800
No offence but I think i'd rather
keep working at the brothel.

537
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,000
I can't stop working babe, I tried.

538
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,400
What's the matter honey?

539
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,200
Who is he?

540
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,400
It's fucking Neville fucking Bartos isn't it?

541
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,000
Mark, you're not gonna
start all this again are you?

542
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,000
I'm talking to you, who is he?

543
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,200
Fuck! You're hurting me!

544
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,800
Is it Neville Bartos?

545
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,000
Let go, let go of me Mark!

546
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,600
- Neville Bartos.
- Fucking let go of me!

547
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,200
What is wrong with you?

548
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,000
I fucking knew it!

549
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Just bloody tell me,
who are you fucking?

550
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
Mark...

551
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,000
Everyone...
I work in a fucking brothel.

552
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,800
That's not what I mean, you know
what I mean, who are you kissing?

553
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,000
You.

554
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,400
See?

555
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,800
I'm kissing you.

556
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,000
You get away from me with
that mouth, it tastes of wog's cock!

557
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,600
You're fucking nice!

558
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,200
Yiou're fucked and you're fat!

559
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,800
What do you want?

560
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
It's me, Mark.

561
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,800
I know who it is,
what do you want?

562
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,800
Baby, just let me in will ya.

563
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,200
No Mark, what do you want?

564
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,400
What do you want?

565
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,800
I'm sorry baby.

566
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,800
Yeah, righto.

567
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,600
I don't wanna see you Mark.

568
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,200
I love you baby.

569
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Pull the other fucking one!

570
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,800
- I need to see you Tanya.
- No, i'm no letting you in.

571
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,200
Got that?

572
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,600
- Come on Tanya.
- No, fuck it!

573
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,000
- Just talk.
- Nothing to talk.

574
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Tanya!

575
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,200
I'm going then.

576
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm fucking going.

577
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,400
Fucking slut!

578
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
- Get out!
- Who are you talking to?

579
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,000
Hello? Is that you Neville?

580
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You fucking rat!

581
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,000
Tanya, you;re coming with me.

582
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,800
Piss off Mark!

583
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
Mark, get out of my house.
Mark, listen to me...

584
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,000
Mum, stay out of it,
i'm not gonna bloody hurt her.

585
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
Mark, for goodness dake.

586
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Come here Tanya!

587
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
- Why?
- Don't Mark!

588
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Why Neville?

589
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,200
Why Neville?

590
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,200
You ruined everything!

591
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,800
Settle down!

592
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,000
- For God's sake!
- Leave it mum, get out of here!

593
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,200
Now look what you've done!

594
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Now look what you've gone and done!

595
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,600
My mum's upset.

596
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm a bloody
disappointment to you aren't I?

597
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,800
What?

598
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,200
You've probably read all the
newspaper stories about me...

599
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,000
And you've heard the
word on the street about me...

600
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,400
And you've got a picture in your
head of what Chopper Read's like...

601
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,200
And we're sitting here at this
bar all very nice and cosy...

602
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,400
I'm a bit of a bloody let down to you.

603
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,800
What are you on about Mark?

604
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,600
I feel like I should be doing
more for you Mr Downie.

605
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,800
There's crims out there that get
round like a protected species.

606
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,000
Why?

607
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,800
I know you blokes don't mind
turning the occasional blind eye...

608
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,000
whilst I deal out my
own bit of justice, right?

609
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,800
Mark, that's not the way we operate.

610
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:46,134
I understand perfectly Mr Downie...

611
00:47:46,134 --> 00:47:48,653
there are certain things
you can't appear to condone.

612
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:51,800
Appearance's got nothing to
do with it. We don't condone it.

613
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,600
I understand Mr Downie.

614
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Who is it?

615
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,200
Nick, go see who it is.

616
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
Who there?

617
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,000
It's me.

618
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,800
What the fuck do you want?

619
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Is Neville home?

620
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,200
Nev!

621
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,200
What the fuck do you want?

622
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,400
I just came over to apologise.

623
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,800
How the fuck did you
find out where I live?

624
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,200
Don't worry about it, i'm a bit embarrassed about what happened the other night.

625
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,800
I just came over to
apologise and clear it up.

626
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,000
You mad bastard.

627
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,400
You've got a nerve coming around here.

628
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
No fucking about. This is a
very good neighbourhood.

629
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,800
No fucking around.

630
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You understand?

631
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,600
Open the gates Nev, come on.

632
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,400
I'm gonna let you in... you're
playing the game by my rules.

633
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah, it's your house.

634
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,600
It's a lovely house too.

635
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,000
- Full respect mate.
- There'd better be respect

636
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,400
Total respect.

637
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,200
Is that back garage shut Nick?

638
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,400
- Sure?
- Yeah.

639
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Check it out.

640
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,400
- You're bloody killing me.
- How well have I done?

641
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
Who's the king?

642
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,400
It's very nice.

643
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,800
What are you doing mate throwing
your cigarettes on the grass?

644
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,600
Nick, pick it up, get it off.

645
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,205
What are you guys doing? You're
following me around like a bad smell.

646
00:49:46,205 --> 00:49:47,258
It's like you wanna fuck me up the arse!

647
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:49,516
Go inside, mix some drinks or
something, get out of here.

648
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,000
It explains your limp.

649
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,000
- Can you dive in?
- No sorry, no grubs allowed.

650
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,400
Have a look at my babies,
are they beautiful or what?

651
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Whatever you do, don't use
the names on those bowls.

652
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,600
They're aliases.

653
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,200
What?

654
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,800
Don't look at me like that,
some smart cunt comes here...

655
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,400
looking to rip me off uses those names
and those dogs will rip him to pieces.

656
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,200
Check this out!

657
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,800
Neville!

658
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,000
Are you bloody right?

659
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,800
I should report you to
the fucking RSPCA you idiot.

660
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,200
No, they like it, they do, my dogs do.

661
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,800
Keeps them alert.

662
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,800
Let's see if those idiots
have got the drinks ready.

663
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,600
Nick?

664
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,600
Neville's turning over
a bit of this stuff is he?

665
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,800
He's got all the spoon
in the western suburbs.

666
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,400
He's doing well then isn't he?

667
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,000
You think he'll want to
give a bit of cash my way?

668
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
I don't think he'll go for that.

669
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,200
Fuck him, he'll have to go for it.

670
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
Neville?

671
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,800
Nev, I hear you want
to give me a bit of money.

672
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,600
Where did you hear that mate?

673
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,400
It's just the mail,
I can collect it now if you like.

674
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,600
I think someone's pulling your leg mate.

675
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Someone's pulling your leg Neville.

676
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,955
Someone'll pull your other
fucking leg in a minute.

677
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:30,357
Now how much do
you wanna give me?

678
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,600
Who do you think you're talking to mate?

679
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm Neville Bartos.

680
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,200
Or has your fucking memory
lapsed you fucking idiot?

681
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,800
What?

682
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,600
Who do you think you're talking to mate?

683
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,400
Sorry, was I being rude?

684
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:47,504
Yes, you were being very
fucking rude, you fucking dickhead.

685
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:48,891
You wanna make some
money you make it yourself.

686
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:52,000
Get him a drink Nick.
And behave, I said behave.

687
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,600
Fucking idiot! Can you
believe that fucking cunt or what?

688
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,400
I'm sorry mate, where are you?

689
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,800
I'm sorry mate.

690
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,600
I've had a couple of drinks, I get a bit
carried away, i've just been out of it.

691
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,600
Sorry, give a bit of goey.

692
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,800
I don't know who you think you're talking
to but you're being very rude understand?

693
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,200
Show me some repsect, very very rude.

694
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,800
I'm fucking embarrassed.

695
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,400
I'm fucking sorry Nev. I'm sorry.

696
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,200
Alright mate, apology
accepted, now let it go, relax...

697
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,800
Take it easy, i'm trying to relax over here.

698
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,200
But seriously Nev, how you holding
for cash? I'm a bit bloody broke.

699
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,600
What are you talking about?

700
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Cash.

701
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,600
There's no cash here!

702
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,200
Here there's no cash, alright?
Cash, no, Robbo?

703
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,400
No cash.

704
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,400
I tell you what, you try and get from
where you're sitting to the front door.

705
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,600
Because I reckon I could shoot you from
where you're sitting to the frint door.

706
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,200
Because that's about as long as you've
got to produce some money for me.

707
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,800
I'll give you 20 seconds to produce
some cash of i'll fucking shoot you.

708
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,000
I've got no cash mate...

709
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,600
Jesus, you come here, I give you a
drink, what's that matter with you?

710
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,400
Sit the fuck down!

711
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,200
Listen...

712
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,600
Stop with the fucking cannon,
what are you doing?

713
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,000
What the fuck are you doing?
Jesus, relax, he's not your enemy!

714
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,400
He fucking is no, isn't he?

715
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,400
Get a fucking rag!

716
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,800
Forget the rag boys,
get the fucking cash will you.

717
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,800
Frozen! How long's it gonna
take to defrost that you idiot?

718
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,600
He's ina  bad way mate.

719
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,000
What's thew matter Neville? You
burst your appendix or something?

720
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,400
Come on Chopper, we've
gotta get him to the hospital.

721
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,600
So you took him to the hospital?

722
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,800
No I didn't take him to the bloodt hospital.

723
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,800
Now tell me this, why
would I shoot a bloke, bang...

724
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,800
then put him in the car and whizz
him off to the hospital at 100mph?

725
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,000
It defeats the purpose of
shooting him in the first place.

726
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,600
What's more, it's bloody insulting!

727
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,000
Am I the only standover
man in the country...

728
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
who provides a medical
plan for these customers?

729
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,000
Do I look like Mark Brandon
'Medicare' Read or something?

730
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,600
Who's bloody driving?

731
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,800
Such a bloody sook!

732
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,800
Such a big fuss over such a little
hole. I'll put one in the brain then.

733
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,200
Chopper, come on,
don't do this to your mates!

734
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:57,672
You're a dead man Chopper.

735
00:54:57,672 --> 00:55:00,430
You're walking around with
one foot in the fucking grave!

736
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,200
Get in you fucking golliwog!

737
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,200
Hospital driver.

738
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,800
He says you took him to the hospital.

739
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,600
You spoken to him have you?

740
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,800
It's just what he's
been saying around town.

741
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,400
You'd do well to have a look at
the motives behind him saying that.

742
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,200
Why would he say it if it's not true?

743
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,800
I don't know, i'm not a
bloody psychiatrist am I?

744
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,800
Look Mark, this is no fucking joke.

745
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,000
I don't fucking appreciate this, we've
heard you've been running around town...

746
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,400
telling all and sundry...

747
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,000
that we've given you virtual
carte blanche to commit crime.

748
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,400
No Mr Downie, that's rubbish,
it's complete fucking bullshit.

749
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,200
Fucking eh it's! bullshit.

750
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,600
You get these fucking
speed freaks together...

751
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,800
they'll create all
kinds of fanciful stories.

752
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,000
Oh yeah?

753
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,800
The other fanciful story is
they've put out a contract on you.

754
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,600
Fucking Mafia, wankers.

755
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,000
Who are they anyway?
Bloody fruit shop owners.

756
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,000
They should stick to selling their
bloody fruit and veg and leave me alone.

757
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,000
I'd be taking this
seriously if I were you.

758
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,800
I'm taking it seriously,
i'm shaking in my boots.

759
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,400
Apparently they're going to
try and get you at Bojangles.

760
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,800
Anastopoulos and Bartos have
gone to Sydney for the weekend.

761
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,600
So obviously they're not fucking around.

762
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,600
They should stay in Sydney
those razzle dazzle wankers.

763
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,400
It'd suit their style.

764
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,000
Anytime you ever see a Sydney
criminal on the television is when...

765
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,000
he's lying in the gutter...

766
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,000
dead after being killed by a
bloody imported Melbourne hitman.

767
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,600
I really think you should
be taking this seriously.

768
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,400
I'm taking it seriously, trust me.

769
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,200
Jimmy Loughnan's name
has also been mentioned.

770
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,800
Jimmy Loughnan?

771
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,600
He's a fucking couch potato.

772
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,400
It's just what we heard.

773
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,400
Jimmy Loughnan?
Are you sure?

774
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,600
Get the fuck up now!

775
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Come on!

776
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,400
Oh for fuck sake!

777
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Put the fucking thing away will you.

778
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,200
Put the fucking thing awat!

779
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
- Do you want a look?
- No, fuck off!

780
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
Get up, get the fucking door!

781
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,600
You're crazy!

782
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
-Who is it?
- Mark.

783
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,400
Mark who?

784
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,600
Chopper.

785
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,200
What're you doing coming around here?

786
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
All those problems we've had,
they're all in the past.

787
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,400
And all these rumours that are
flying around, they're all bullshit.

788
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,800
I just wanna come in,
I wanna be friends.

789
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,000
What rumours?

790
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,000
That i'm gonna clip you.

791
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,400
I haven't heard that one.

792
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,200
Well it's not true.
Just let us in will you.

793
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Mate, i'm not letting you in,
i've got kids here.

794
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,800
They're just little kids...

795
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,200
and they'll be afraid by
seeing a man with no ears.

796
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,000
Right.

797
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's nothing personal.

798
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,400
No, it's no problem.

799
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,000
Who is it?

800
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,000
Come on Jim, just let us in.
I'll come in and have a chat.

801
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,800
Come on mate!

802
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,600
I don't bloody bite.

803
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
Alright.

804
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,400
Just hang on...

805
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,600
Get out the way!

806
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,200
Are you armed?

807
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,400
Of course i'm bloody armed.

808
00:59:07,738 --> 00:59:09,164
I've got a bunch of
peanuts trying to kill me...

809
00:59:09,164 --> 00:59:10,865
would I get around
without my fucking guns?

810
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,000
Alright, well you throw them in,
you throw them all in or...

811
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,200
I'm not gonna let you in.
Throw them in first.

812
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,800
Alright?

813
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,600
Nice stick, is that it?

814
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,200
No, one more.

815
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,200
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

816
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,800
I know you...

817
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,400
Ladies' gun.

818
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,200
Beautiful.

819
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,000
It's a girls' gun but it does the job.

820
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,000
Mark, this is my fiancée, Mandy.

821
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,600
Hello, Mandy.

822
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,000
Fiancée eh?

823
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,000
You'd better speed it up and make
an honest women of her quick...

824
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
The bun's nearly cooked!

825
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,800
You got your finger in
your mouth there little one.

826
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,000
This is plush mate, this is swank.

827
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,400
Who says crime doesn't pay?

828
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,200
It is a nice gun.

829
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,600
You got yourself a
family now Jim, little girl.

830
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,400
That's lovely mate. I don't reckon
I could ever have a family though.

831
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:41,036
They're the sort of thing that
could be used against you.

832
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:42,769
You know what I mean?

833
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:46,464
No, not the way that sounded
but you know what I mean.

834
01:00:46,464 --> 01:00:47,547
You alright there love?

835
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,000
How come he hasn't got any ears?

836
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,200
How come I hasn't got any ears?
You're a cheeky little girl aren't you?

837
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,600
Mandy, get Shazzy off to bed now!

838
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,200
Hey, wake up.
Come on twinkletoes, up, let's go!

839
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,200
- Ye righto.
- It's bedtime.

840
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,800
I don't wanna go to bed.

841
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,000
Not you, Shazzy, it's
Shazzy's bedtime. Put her to bed.

842
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,800
Good on you Shazzy.

843
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,200
Night Shazza.

844
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,400
See ya Shazzy!
Take mummy to bed.

845
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,800
See ya Shazzy!

846
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,800
Say goodnight to uncle Chop.

847
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,400
Jesus Jim.

848
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,800
You really have landed
on your knees haven't ya?

849
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
What are you doing here?

850
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,400
What? Can't I visit a mate?

851
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,400
You and I were very best of friends.

852
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,200
I do have a couple of
questions for you though.

853
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,200
I've got a couple of questions.

854
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
Now the first question is:

855
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,200
Is there something you're
supposed to be telling me?

856
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,800
No.

857
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
There's nothing you're
supposed to be telling me?

858
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,600
No mate.

859
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,400
Eveything that's happened in the past...

860
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,400
I'll wash it all away, so long as
there's nothing I need to know now.

861
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,200
You're not angry at me for anything?

862
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,600
No, i'm not angry with you,
it's all water under the bridge.

863
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,400
No new water, no fresh buckets?

864
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,200
There's no fresh buckets coming round.

865
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,800
Now the second question:

866
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,000
Are you employed at the moment,
are you gainfully employed?

867
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,000
I perish the thought.

868
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,400
How much you using?

869
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,400
I've got a handle on it.
It's...

870
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,000
Fucking H division mate.

871
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,200
The only thing you ever had
a handle on Jimmy Loughnan...

872
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,800
was the occasional knife handle
when things got a bit too much for you.

873
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,400
Knife handling the old Chop Chop.

874
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,800
Jimmy, listen,
i'm gonna show you somthing.

875
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,400
Now if this goes any further,
my life's in danger...

876
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,600
and you'll be the one
who's getting killed, alright?

877
01:04:09,074 --> 01:04:11,022
Now have a look at this,
I need someone to help we work.

878
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:13,050
Guess who i'm working for now?

879
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,800
Bloody guess, have a bloody guess.

880
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,800
Fuck, eh...

881
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,200
Wrong, begins with C.

882
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,200
Amanda Duncan.

883
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,000
- Cops?
- Yeah.

884
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,600
I got a fucking green light
from them, have a look at this.

885
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,000
Dirty Dick Downie.

886
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,200
He looks like a fucking
accountant but he's a hard bastard.

887
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,800
Super Steve Cooney,
look out Super Steve.

888
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,400
You heard about
Neville Bartos' burst appendix?

889
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
That was me and the raincoat man.
Downie was driving the car.

890
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,800
You drove him to the hospital.

891
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,400
No I didn't drive
him to the bloody hospital.

892
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,000
Do I look like Mother Teresa to you?

893
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,800
You know him do you?

894
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,000
Who?

895
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,000
Fucking who? Neville.

896
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,600
What are you doing
standing there sticky nose?

897
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:22,200
I fucking live here, you shouldn't
be talking about this stuff here!

898
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,600
Oh, fucking go and do the dishes!

899
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,200
Fucking shut up!

900
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,000
Don't come back in here
when we're talking business!

901
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Business eh?
I bet you've got a briefcase there.

902
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,000
So there's nothing you're
supposed to be telling me Jim?

903
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,600
Nothing about a
contract that's out on me?

904
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,000
You must have two
dozen contracts out on you.

905
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,600
Aall apparently Neville Bartos and
Nick Anastopoulos...

906
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,800
and the rest of the fairy godfathers
have put a contract out on me.

907
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,200
Look mate, I don't
know anything about it.

908
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,400
Really? You see I heard you're
the one who's supposed to do it.

909
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,000
I guess it's a case of first,
best dressed isn't it.

910
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,800
No Mark, you're
being fucking paranoid.

911
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,200
Just because i'm being paranoid doesn't
mean people aren't trying to kill me.

912
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,400
Mark, i've got kids here man.
I've got kids here, alright?

913
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,200
Chop, he really likes you,
he speaks highly of you!

914
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,000
He wouldn't fucking try and knock you!

915
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,600
Fucking sure he fucking does.

916
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,800
- Well fucking shoot me!
- Don't shoot him...

917
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,200
- Shoot me in front of my kids!
- Put the gun away Chopper!

918
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,800
Shoot me in front of my kids!

919
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,200
Go on you fucking cunt, go on!

920
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,400
I'm sorry Jim.

921
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,000
I didn't mean to bloody scare you.

922
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,400
You gotta relax a bit man,
you gotta take it easy.

923
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,600
You gotta get out of town.

924
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,800
- You're jumpy.
- Yeah whatever.

925
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,600
Look at you though, bloody hell!

926
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,200
You're going bad Jim. You've
got bloody kids and everything.

927
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,200
For Christ's sake.

928
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,200
Fix your house up, fix you're bloody
kids up, get your life in order.

929
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,400
You can't live like this,
it's bloody terrible, take it.

930
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,200
Jim, mother's a
drug addict for fuck sake!

931
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,000
That's not for drugs.

932
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,600
Jim, don't slam the fucking door!
The kids are asleep.

933
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,400
At least they were.
Who you ringing?

934
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,000
Get dressed, we're going out.

935
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,800
Get dressed? We've got no money.
Where we going?

936
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:53,600
Just get dressed, we're going out, ok?
Get me my gun, get me my jacket, quick.

937
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,800
Jesus, where we going?

938
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,800
It's 1 o'clock, it
better be fucking good.

939
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,000
Neville.

940
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,000
It's Loughnan.
Yeah, he's just been here.

941
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,800
- Has he?
- Just left my place.

942
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,000
- Where's he fucking going?
- He's going to Bojangles.

943
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,800
Bojangles, great job,
i'll get my jacket.

944
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,200
Fuck Neville Bartos!

945
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,000
He couldn't have the fluff
to knock off a cappuccino.

946
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,000
He's saying that you're two-faced.

947
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,000
I'm not bloody two-faced!

948
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,600
The word is and i'm hearing it everywhere
is that you're working for the cops.

949
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,000
Who says that?

950
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,400
I'm hearing it everywhere.

951
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:34,036
You gotta look at the motives behind
the people saying this stuff.

952
01:08:34,602 --> 01:08:35,735
I'm not well liked Ian.

953
01:08:36,382 --> 01:08:38,677
Do you realise it's the world's
worst best kept secret that...

954
01:08:38,677 --> 01:08:40,301
i've giving you me
and it bloody information?

955
01:08:40,301 --> 01:08:42,800
Do you think there are sharks running
around telling people about this stuff?

956
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,600
That'd be sort of counter-productive.

957
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,000
I like a smiling face Mr Downie
and you know I like you...

958
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,400
but i'm an expert at playing mind
games, i'll set my little traps...

959
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,800
and i'll find out where
the leak is coming from.

960
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,800
It's good to see you my friend.
Do you want a drink?

961
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,400
No, no, that's alright mate.

962
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,200
Let me buy you drink,
I have plenty money...

963
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,000
I buy you two dozen drink.

964
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,800
- Later, alright?
- You won't forget?

965
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,200
- Thanks. - You want
drink you come see me.

966
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Who's that?

967
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,400
Who?

968
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
The fucking wog
character up at the bar.

969
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,400
That's Sammy the Turk.

970
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,400
Really?

971
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,800
You wanna know
if she's got friends?

972
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,200
What are you touching for me
all the time? You bloody homosexual?

973
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,400
Why you scared?

974
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,400
I'm not scared just don't
touch me you bloody poofta.

975
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,200
- Where's your car?
- It's up there!

976
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,400
Which one?

977
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,600
- Keep going.
- Where?

978
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,600
Is that gun eh?

979
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,000
Yeah it's a gun, it's pointed at you.
Now, who's team are you on?

980
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,400
What?

981
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,800
Who's team are you on?

982
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,000
Team, football?

983
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,200
Fucking comedian too are you?

984
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,400
Why'd you fucking bring me out here?

985
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,600
What?

986
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,400
No no Chop...
you bring me here.

987
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,200
You're fucking good aren't you?

988
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,200
Yes i'm good, i'm friend to you.

989
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,203
Yeah you're a
fucking friend aren't ya?

990
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:36,572
Bringing me out here in the middle
of the fucking night, what for?

991
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,200
What?

992
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,200
What's that mean?

993
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,800
You want English?

994
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,400
Speak fucking English!
It's Australia!

995
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,400
Fuck you!
That's English.

996
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,800
You alright?

997
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,200
Give me a look.

998
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,200
You alright? I'm sorry mate.

999
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Jimmy!

1000
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,800
That fucking lunatic just shot a bloke,
he just shot him in the eye!

1001
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,200
Don't shout my name!

1002
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,200
Who's this bloke?

1003
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:25,600
I don't know, shut the fuck up Marcus!
I never liked you, let me in the car!

1004
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,000
Calm down!

1005
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,600
Who's this bloke?

1006
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,600
Let me get in.

1007
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,400
Calm down!

1008
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,800
Now this character, he's
following me around all night...

1009
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,600
he's got his arm around me all night,
he's buying me drinks, buying me drinks...

1010
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,800
buying me drinks, in my company,
right here, all frickin' night.

1011
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,400
I didn't know him, I didn't
know him from a bar of soap.

1012
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,400
You know me, I don't go out my
way to befriend our ethnic cousins.

1013
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,400
He's Turkish or something, i've
got enough on my plate as it is.

1014
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,000
Yeah, go on.

1015
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,200
He wants to sell me this gun.

1016
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,000
He says he's got all
these guns in the car outside.

1017
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,600
Well I didn't have 10 cents on me.

1018
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,600
But I don't think he had a
gun salesmen's license either.

1019
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,800
I thought if he wants to sell
me a gun i'll relieve him of it.

1020
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,400
He's very keen to get me
into this carpark mind you.

1021
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,400
So did you go outside with him?

1022
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,400
What happened was we go to the carpark...

1023
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,800
Bojangles has got two carparks...

1024
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,200
I head to the main carpark and...

1025
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,200
he pulls me up, he says:

1026
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,200
No Chopper, this way,
this way over here...

1027
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,600
I park over here, on this side.

1028
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,400
Plenty guns, very good guns.

1029
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,600
I get a bit bloody suspicious because...

1030
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,400
this carpark is not very well
lit, it's pitch bloody black...

1031
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,400
and I walk out there, i'm
following him, and he stops dead...

1032
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,000
and he turns around...

1033
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,200
and he's looking
over my bloody shoulder.

1034
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,200
This fucking prick is
checking for bloody witnesses.

1035
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,800
All of a sudden he
turns around, he says:

1036
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,400
Hey, wait, Chopper, you got gun?

1037
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,000
He's walking towards me. "You got gun?"

1038
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,200
I said yeah, I got a gun.

1039
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,400
He says:

1040
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,600
What sort? Show me please.

1041
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,000
"Show me your fucking gun."
He's dying to see my bloody gun.

1042
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,000
I had the gun down the front of my
pants, so i've lifted up my jacket...

1043
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,200
i've looked down at my gun and
this cheeky little fucking rat...

1044
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,200
he's grabbed the gun as quick
as lightning, he's pulled it out...

1045
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,400
and he pointed it at
my head and he's gone...

1046
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,200
Click click click with the trigger.

1047
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,400
It's not going off.

1048
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,000
It's a 32 automatic.

1049
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,800
Now as you fellas know, unless
you've got the hammer pulled back...

1050
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,200
It's not gonna go off, it's an operative.

1051
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,600
You can pull the trigger all bloody
day long and it's not gonna go off.

1052
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,600
Yeah sure so...

1053
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,200
What happened then?

1054
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,600
So he's got the gun at my
head, he's going click click click...

1055
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,600
and I have got the 410 shotgun down
the back of my pants, so I pull it out.

1056
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,000
It's a tiny little bloody 410 shotgun...

1057
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,800
He's going click click click...

1058
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,800
I'm thinking to myself, shit, it's only
gonna take him a couple of seconds...

1059
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,000
to work this thing out
with the hammer so...

1060
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,600
i've pulled out the bllody 410 and...

1061
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,400
I just go fucking bang.

1062
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,800
And that was it.

1063
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,400
He just bloody fell over.

1064
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,000
Mark, what game are you playing?
Is this another one of your traps?

1065
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,200
What do you mean?

1066
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,600
Are you testing us?
Do you wanna see if...

1067
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,800
we're gonna rush off to the
homicide squad and dob you in?

1068
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,200
What?

1069
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,600
We know you didn't shoot the Turk.

1070
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,400
I just told you I shot the Turk.

1071
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,400
They picked up the bloke that did it.

1072
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,600
What fucking bloke
that did it? I did it.

1073
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,400
No, homicide have picked up the guy.

1074
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,800
- They've even got the murder weapon.
- What murder weapon?

1075
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,600
A 410 shotgun.

1076
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,600
This bloody 410 shotgun.

1077
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,000
Put it away Mark, just put it away.
This thing, it's a 410...

1078
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
fine, it's a 410, there's a
fucking million 410s out there.

1079
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,000
That's not the 410 that did it.

1080
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,800
You don't want this?
It's a murder weapon!

1081
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,200
Put the gun away.

1082
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,200
Take it down to bloody forensic.

1083
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,200
How long have you
been on the go mate?

1084
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,400
On the go mate? The only 
person on the go here is you.

1085
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,000
The fucking goey mate, where's the 
crust mate? You're off you're dial.

1086
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,400
I don't think i've ever been as 
bloody insulted as I am right now.

1087
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,000
I'm sitting here confessing 
to a fucking murder...

1088
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
i've known you since 
I was a fucking pup...

1089
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,200
and you've got the fucking 
audacity to drag this cunt here...

1090
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,600
Sort out you're boy would you.

1091
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,200
and you look at me 
like i'm a fucking idiot.

1092
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,200
You're a bullshitter, simple.

1093
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:42,000
I just saw on the TV a 
man was shot at Bojangles .

1094
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,600
I thought it was you.

1095
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,600
Well it couldn't be me could it 
or else I wouldn't be standing here.

1096
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,200
Used to be bloody Chopper Read...

1097
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,200
Now I can't even get 
arrested in this fucking town.

1098
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,600
Did you do that?

1099
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Would I do a thing like that?

1100
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,400
That's my boy, one in the skull!

1101
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,200
It took those numbskulls two 
weeks to finally get around to...

1102
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,800
sorting the whole 
mess out and arresting me.

1103
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,600
Turns out Mandy Carroll was there that night.

1104
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,200
Followed me and Sammy out to 
the carpark and saw the whole thing.

1105
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,000
What I seen when the 
man got shot was like...

1106
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,200
a flash from the 
side of his face like...

1107
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,600
yellow colours.

1108
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:44,000
You know when you fire a 
gun and you see the flashes.

1109
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,400
Did you see a gun in 
the Turkish man's hands?

1110
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:49,537
The Turk was just standing there, 
he didn't have anything in his hands...

1111
01:18:49,611 --> 01:18:50,769
he didn't have a gun, nothing.

1112
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,400
He was just copping at sweet.

1113
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,400
"Copping at sweet."

1114
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,600
She turned crown witness against me...

1115
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,200
Claimed that I murdered 
the Turk in cold blood.

1116
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,400
But what was she doing, 
8 months pregnant...

1117
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,000
bloody stoned off her tits...

1118
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,600
down at Bojangles at 6 in the morning?

1119
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,000
Jimmy and the boys will be in the car.

1120
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,600
You help setup the big 
fella, it'll make you a star.

1121
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,600
They said they had it farmed out,
They had it ghosted,

1122
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,000
But when I walked out the door,
They just left me posted.

1123
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,200
The game was for real,
It was no lark,

1124
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,000
But the twit took him out
to the wrong carpark.

1125
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,400
Siily boys, that's all 
that Chopper had to say,

1126
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,400
And poor little Sammy got blown away.

1127
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,400
The knuckleheads! I could've 
shot them in both kneecaps...

1128
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,800
and finished a game of cards...

1129
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,800
before this crew of 
retards got their act together.

1130
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,800
I'd like to thank my legal 
team for all their hard work.

1131
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,000
Solicitor Mr Pat Hutton, 
my barrister Mr Morris Jeffery...

1132
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,800
and queen's council Mr Damien Collins.

1133
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:07,303
It was their sterling, bloody sterling 
legal work that helped me beat the rap.

1134
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,430
I'm just bloody rapt.

1135
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,600
I beat the murder Blue on 
the grounds of self defence...

1136
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,600
but I got 5 years 
for malicious wounding...

1137
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,800
and other assorted scallywag behaviour.

1138
01:20:28,396 --> 01:20:32,142
I don't wanna put shit on myself but
the shooting of Sammy the Turk...

1139
01:20:32,393 --> 01:20:33,534
at Bojangles nightclub...

1140
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:39,124
is the most shitpot non-event murder 
case in Australian criminal history.

1141
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,000
But for some reason I get all 
these letter from all over the world...

1142
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,800
and photos where all these crackpots 
have gone down and taken photos.

1143
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,600
I've got a letter here from the 
sheriff of Sparkes county, Nevada...

1144
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,400
wishing I was there.

1145
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,200
And have a look, for some reason 
they go down and take photos.

1146
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,200
Bloody South African backpackers...

1147
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,800
Bloody funny-looking homosexual...

1148
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,200
How did he end up in there?

1149
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,800
Housewives...

1150
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,600
Bloody nitwits, these 
young criminal wannabes...

1151
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,800
spunky ladies with lingerie...

1152
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,000
It's unbelievable. 
I guess it's old Chop Chop...

1153
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,800
doing his bit for tourism Victoria.

1154
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,000
She's alright Chopper.

1155
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,400
She's behind the letter 
writing protest to the governer.

1156
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,400
Isn't she boss?

1157
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,200
She'd be writing a few letters of 
protest if I ever got my hands on her.

1158
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,200
Oh really Bucky? Can I 
introduce you to a friend of mine?

1159
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,600
Get the camera over to Bucky.

1160
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,800
Bucky, get over here.
Here he is, young Bucky.

1161
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,800
Show her tatto Buck. Hoik it up!

1162
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,800
"King Kong" and why's he got that?
Voila! Copycat!

1163
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,400
Isn't that bloody pathetic?

1164
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:45,000
If you wanna be like 
your uncle Chop Chop...

1165
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
get them ears chopped off! Now get 
outta here, they're interested in me.

1166
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,800
Go on piss off, get out!

1167
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:56,000
Get the bloody camera...
Don't worry about Bucky.

1168
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,400
What is this? 
I haven't got all day!

1169
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,800
Continue! Roll along.

1170
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,000
So, how would you 
describe yourself now?

1171
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,800
Just a bloke.

1172
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Just a good bloke down on his luck.

1173
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,400
You don't seem out of luck to me.
You've written a best-seller.

1174
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,400
Yeah I know... 
and I can't even bloody spell.

1175
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,400
What about those poor bloody 
academics, those college graduates...

1176
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,800
battling their guts out to 
write some airy-fairy piece of...

1177
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,800
exaggerated artwork.
And there's a bloke, 

1178
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:34,200
sitting in a cell, who can't spell, 
and he's written a best-seller.

1179
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:38,600
It's sold 250,000 copies. 
And it's still selling

1180
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:42,400
And he's writing another one!
And I can't even spell!

1181
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,400
I'm semi-bloody-illiterate.

1182
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,200
They must hate my guts eh?

1183
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,200
- Have you got all your stuff?
- Yeah.

1184
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,800
So what do you reckon?
We entering Logie country or what?

1185
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,600
Jana Wendt look out!

1186
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,000
We can send you a 
rough cut before we go to air.

1187
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
No, that's alright. Anything I say 
would just be bloody fiddling anyway.

1188
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,600
I'm sure i'll be very happy with it, 
i'm sure it'll be exactly what I want.

1189
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,600
Absolutely.

1190
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,000
It'll be very good won't it?

1191
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:29,289
He is Australia's most feared criminal. 
Self-styled crime commando who...

1192
01:23:29,513 --> 01:23:33,119
terrorised, tortured and murdered 
dozens of drug dealers and armed robbers

1193
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:34,305
on the streets of Melbourne.

1194
01:23:34,544 --> 01:23:37,135
He is, of course, 
Mark Brandon "Chopper" Read.

1195
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,800
He is also a best-selling author.

1196
01:23:40,321 --> 01:23:43,683
- And I can't even bloody spell!
- ...this exclusive interview.

1197
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:46,709
Mark Read says he's 
committed 19 murders...

1198
01:23:47,073 --> 01:23:50,864
but he's only ever been charged 
with one and he was acquitted of that.

1199
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,000
Nevertheless, he's much 
of his adult life behind bars...

1200
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,400
the rest on the street disposing of...

1201
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,000
what he calls, "Human Filth".

1202
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,200
Did you really cut people's toes off?

1203
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,800
My word, yeah.

1204
01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:07,487
You see to it with the bolt cutters 
they come to it every time.

1205
01:24:08,641 --> 01:24:10,865
- They love it.
- They love it?

1206
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,400
Well they don't like it, 
they scream a lot, but I liked it.

1207
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,400
Yeah, I like cutting off their toes.

1208
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,400
What did you like about it?

1209
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,400
You know, 
the way these just... pop off.

1210
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,600
You've got the money...

1211
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,800
and you're going to kill them, so 
when do these good manners kick in?

1212
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,400
- Work it out! - ...break the news 
to them that their number's up?

1213
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,000
You say "Look, you've given me you're 
money, you've been a good sport...

1214
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,400
I do apologise but i'm 
gonna have to kill you. "

1215
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,800
You don't really do all that stuff?

1216
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,800
What?

1217
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,600
All that stuff you're saying on TV.

1218
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,000
You know me, never let the truth 
get in the way of a good yarn.

1219
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,600
Come and have a look one day.

1220
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,200
I fancy the 10 toes 
that i've got, i'll keep them.

1221
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,200
- You've got a nice foot.
- Thanks.

1222
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,800
Unbelievable, smiling your little 
pearly teeth at her, she's loving it.

1223
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:09,441
Rene Brach with that report from Pentridge.

1224
01:25:09,868 --> 01:25:12,757
I get the feeling that that's not the 
last we'll be hearing from Mark Read.

1225
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:13,993
Too bloody right!

1226
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:16,574
I must point out that Chopper Read 
was not paid for that interview.

1227
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
This programme does not pay criminals.

1228
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,200
Bring it! Give us more! 
Where you going?

1229
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:28,400
What's going on here?
Is that it?

1230
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:31,565
How much do you want mate?

1231
01:25:31,565 --> 01:25:34,382
Jeses Christ, it's a television 
station, they gotta sell stuff.

1232
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,000
Brilliant bloody publicity if you ask me.
What's that gotta be worth to me?

1233
