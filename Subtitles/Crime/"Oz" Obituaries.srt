1
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,794
Obituaries.

2
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:57,797
A man or a woman
lives their entire life,

3
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:00,698
they work and love
and dream and laugh and cry.

4
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,725
Then they die.

5
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:08,972
And then somebody
who they don't even know,

6
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,409
who's never met them once,

7
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,913
boils their entire life
down to a paragraph or two

8
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:15,972
in a local newspaper.

9
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:18,143
And that's only if they
achieved something--

10
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:20,585
something that the editor
thinks is important.

11
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,747
Now if they're real movers,
real shakers,

12
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:24,757
maybe they get two columns.

13
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,487
Maybe they get
a photo from 197 4.

14
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,121
lf they've achieved nothing,

15
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,601
they get buried
at the bottom of the page

16
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,535
or ignored completely.

17
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,277
The homicide unit has finished
its investigation.

18
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:52,115
Guillaume Tarrant shot
seven people before killing himself.

19
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:54,780
Four people are dead:
officer Joseph Howard,

20
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:57,790
and prisoners Lou Wrath,
Junior Pierce and Kenny White.

21
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:00,725
What's the status of the other
three inmates, Keller, Seran and Ahmad?

22
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,728
They're all
at Mission Memorial.

23
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,060
Seran and Ahmad
had superficial wounds.

24
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:08,795
They should be back today,
but Keller had internal damage.

25
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:11,235
He'll be in the hospital
a while.

26
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:13,239
Yeah, l keep
asking myself,

27
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,241
how did that fucking gun
get in Oz?

28
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:16,640
l don't know,
Murphy.

29
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:18,701
But l'm sure as Christ
gonna find out.

30
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,247
We don't know
where the gun came from.

31
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:25,911
Why are you asking us? That was
a white man's finger on the trigger.

32
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:28,386
l'm talking to everyone.

33
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,912
Whether you find out
the truth or not,

34
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:33,255
one thing is clear--

35
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:35,352
Emerald City
is out of control.

36
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:37,363
McManus must go.

37
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:40,264
You telling me who to hire
and who to fire, Adebisi?

38
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,768
Just pointing out reality.

39
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:44,770
McManus was lax.

40
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:46,863
Ultimately, the responsibility is his.

41
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:49,467
And you better act fast.
The press wants answers.

42
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:53,605
- Public wants someone to blame.
- Thank you for your concern.

43
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:57,783
You two were very chummy
in there.

44
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:00,786
Rare finding
such agreement.

45
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,414
So you are saying
you don't want McManus to be fired?

46
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:09,562
See that?
What is going on?

47
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:11,564
What do you care?

48
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,123
You lost the taste of power,
isn't that what you said?

49
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,135
- Yeah.
- You're outta this.

50
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,364
Beginning of the day,
the way to wisdom,

51
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:20,805
the wish, the will
to treat, to try, to trip.

52
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,307
You can memorialize
them hacks--

53
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:24,071
Shut the fuck
up, already!

54
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,136
But my brothers, they're on the backs
in corners like roaches

55
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,308
- after another Raid sweeping?
- Come on, man, enough!

56
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,944
Back of the thigh,
the glimmer in the eye--

57
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,750
Poet, Poet.

58
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,917
- Enough.
- Get the fuck away from me.

59
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,427
You know, Bricks
and Junior is dead.

60
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:44,259
- Dead!
- You and me are alive.

61
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:46,265
They had no heart,
Adebisi.

62
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,267
l have a heart.

63
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,269
l have a heart
of a lion.

64
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,103
lnstead of crying for Kenny and Junior,
help me revenge them.

65
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,268
Revenge against who,
Adebisi?

66
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,768
Tarrant greased
himself.

67
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:03,146
You see,
against them.

68
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,580
All of those
white bastards.

69
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,589
lt wasn't no fucking
white bastard

70
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,887
that poured hot soup on my face,
scarring my skin.

71
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,893
That was you.
That was you!

72
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,555
Yeah, that was then.
This is now.

73
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:19,895
lf you'd been standing one inch
to the left when the shooting started,

74
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,868
you'd be dead, and Kenny Wangler
would be my new best friend.

75
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:31,239
Yo, shit's going down.

76
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:34,576
Yeah, but what? We're on the outside,
nose against the glass.

77
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:36,582
Yeah, not for long,
brother.

78
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:39,244
Fuckin' hacks wanted to know
how Frenchy got the gun.

79
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,583
And you know
who did?

80
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,919
Fucking Cocola,
man, Adebisi.

81
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,585
l saw him with the gun
the day before the shooting.

82
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:48,594
Does Adebisi know
you know?

83
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:51,620
Not yet. Probably he gonna
find out soon enough.

84
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:59,271
lntegrity...

85
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:02,706
it's what sets real leaders apart
from typical politicians.

86
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:06,200
One man running for governor
has real integrity.

87
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,874
Alvah Case.
Activist lawyer,

88
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:12,214
Law School Dean,
State Bar President.

89
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:14,880
Nobody questions
his integrity.

90
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,947
So after the riots
at Oswald Prison,

91
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,585
to whom did even James Devlin turn
to sort it out?

92
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:23,391
That's right. Alvah Case.

93
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,456
Unquestioned integrity. For a change.

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,591
Wendy.

95
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,738
McManus has to go.

96
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:36,071
- Seems to be the mantra of the week.
- Have you seen the Trib?

97
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:38,077
Front page,
above the fold.

98
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:42,013
Prison shooting leaves
four dead and two Op Ed pieces.

99
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,879
l can handle a little
negative press.

100
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,249
Not if you want to be
Lieutenant Governor.

101
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:49,153
You need a scapegoat.
You have to fire McManus.

102
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:53,250
- Now is not the time.
- He's screwed up from the get-go.

103
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:56,785
- Have you forgotten the riot?
- The riot was not Tim's fault.

104
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,355
This entire history
of Emerald City has been a disaster.

105
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,367
He's a weak limp-wristed
liberal

106
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,995
and you gotta toss him out
with the other garbage.

107
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:13,713
Here's your mail.

108
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:16,272
You're welcome.

109
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:40,740
''Dear Tim, l know by now

110
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:42,742
that Sister Pete
has given you the news

111
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:44,744
that l'm not
coming back to Oz.

112
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,746
This all must seem
unreal to you.

113
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,748
lt sure as hell
does to me.

114
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:51,148
When l left
two weeks ago on vacation,

115
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:53,652
l never dreamed that my
entire life

116
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,654
could turn around
so far or so fast.

117
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:59,249
l never dreamed that l would meet
a man like Cary, so loving,

118
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,283
so understanding.''

119
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:34,226
l've been asked
to pick one staff member

120
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,058
to serve as part
of a state delegation

121
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:39,064
that's going
to South Africa

122
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:42,067
for a discussion
of human rights issues.

123
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,729
That group will visit
the Pretoria Prison,

124
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,035
the Zonderwater Prison,
as well as--

125
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:50,372
- go on safari.
- Sorry.

126
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,742
Leo, l just want
to talk for one minute, okay?

127
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,179
- l'm in the middle of something.
- Just one minute

128
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,274
about Officer Howard's
memorial service.

129
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,251
lt's important,
God damn it,

130
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:01,412
because the man was killed
right in front of me.

131
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,614
All right,
go ahead.

132
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:08,861
Okay, uh...

133
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:11,125
l think that we should
videotape the ceremony

134
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,155
so that when
his grandkids get older,

135
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,759
they can watch it.

136
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:20,531
Eternal rest grant
onto him, O Lord,

137
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,542
and let perpetual light
shine down upon him.

138
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:25,544
Amen.

139
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:28,206
And now, Tim McManus
would like to say a few words.

140
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,239
Tim?

141
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:35,885
Joe loved
to bet on horses.

142
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:39,380
And so in honor of him,
l would like to--

143
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,241
Come in.

144
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:11,257
Leo, we want
to talk about Tim.

145
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,919
l've had all the discussions
about Tim McManus

146
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,588
- l'm gonna have.
- He's clearly in distress.

147
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:17,994
- Yes.
- He needs help.

148
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,124
- That's what l told him.
- So you've seen him?

149
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,464
- We've been looking everywhere.
- He just left.

150
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,697
- Where did he go?
- l have no idea.

151
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:26,762
We'll try him
at home tonight.

152
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,899
- lf not, we'll see him here tomorrow.
- Right.

153
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:30,967
- l don't think so.
- Why not?

154
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,979
l just fired him.
Good night.

155
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:41,280
l saw this obituary once
of a guy l knew.

156
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:45,280
And the newspaper
had misspelled his name.

157
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:49,284
They misspelled his goddamn
motherfuckin' name.

158
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:52,025
And that's it.
There ain't no goin' back.

159
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:54,363
lt's not like they're gonna get
his name right

160
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,459
the next time
he dies. No.

161
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,470
That edition
of the newspaper

162
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,495
is going in the archives.

163
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,743
And this guy l know--
his name,

164
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:07,405
which is probably
the thing he's proudest of in life,

165
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:09,745
it's gonna be wrong,

166
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:12,774
forever and ever.

167
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:36,809
All right,

168
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:39,311
everybody listen up.

169
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,313
Last night

170
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:43,907
Tim McManus resigned
as Unit Manager of Emerald City.

171
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,849
All right, quiet down!

172
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,948
Until a new unit manager
is named,

173
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:54,619
the warden has asked me
to temporarily

174
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,787
take over McManus' duties.

175
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,297
Hear this:
Nothing,

176
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,425
and l mean nothing's
gonna change.

177
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,867
Yeah, that's what
you think.

178
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:05,598
All right, that's it!

179
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,908
Officer Murphy?

180
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,910
Have you heard the latest
on Chris Keller?

181
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:13,912
l haven't heard
anything new.

182
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,574
- Could you, um, call and check on his--
- Beecher,

183
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,584
we had a major
incident here, all right?

184
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,086
Now we lose Tim McManus.
Your boyfriend's health

185
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,111
ain't a priority
for me.

186
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,020
- Please?
- Go away.

187
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:33,165
l asked my father
to locate Schillinger's other son.

188
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,895
Oz didn't make
you a bitch.

189
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:37,903
You were born one.

190
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:40,371
- Yeah, okay.
- Come here.

191
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,441
You're tormented in your role
in the death over Andrew Schillinger.

192
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,448
You went looking
and you came to me.

193
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,507
You asked for guidance
in the ways of lslam.

194
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:55,317
You sought comfort,
peace of mind in the arms of Allah.

195
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:57,788
But you have this...

196
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,793
thing between you
and Keller.

197
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:04,627
Homosexual acts
are blasphemy.

198
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:07,656
l know that.

199
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:11,395
l want to love him,
Kareem.

200
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,735
l do.

201
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:15,968
And as for Allah,
l'll take my chances with him

202
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,999
when the time comes.

203
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,282
Hey, Beecher.

204
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:26,785
Sorry about what happened
to your little butt buddy.

205
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:31,621
Knowing that kind,
he's probably fucked half his nurses

206
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:34,125
and a couple
of orderlies by now.

207
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,527
Hope he doesn't come back to you
with any of them staff infections.

208
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,365
- Toby.
- Hey, Dad.

209
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:54,480
Good news.

210
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:57,210
We found Hank Schillinger,
by the way.

211
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:00,383
Well, Jesus,
that was fast.

212
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,387
Well, l told you
Swannee's the best.

213
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:05,720
And if you turn over
the right rock, you'll find a worm.

214
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,589
Meaning?

215
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:10,755
Hank Schillinger
is one screwed up kid.

216
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,855
Swannee said he's a--

217
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,992
he's a drug addict,
he's a petty thief.

218
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,025
He pimped
his girlfriend.

219
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:21,505
How long before he'll come
and visit Schillinger?

220
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,135
Well, there's one
slight complication.

221
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:26,270
Boy says he won't come
unless he gets paid.

222
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:28,405
Paid how much?

223
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:29,812
l don't know.

224
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,181
Probably what it'll cost
to get him his next high.

225
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,656
Make the deal.

226
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,682
- Toby--
- Make the deal, Dad.

227
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:50,999
Vern.

228
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:54,632
What the hell--
sorry, heck do you want?

229
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:56,642
You have
a visitor.

230
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:59,042
What, suddenly you're
my appointment secretary?

231
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,808
Hank is here.

232
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:04,577
Hank?
My Hank?

233
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,822
Your father's
on his way.

234
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:24,960
So when do l get
the other half of the money?

235
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:26,835
When you're done.

236
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:30,969
Cool.
So bring him on.

237
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:37,449
How long is this
gonna take?

238
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,474
'Cause l got
to meet somebody.

239
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:47,158
Dude, you look
awesome.

240
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,457
Hello, son.

241
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:51,486
Skinny as shit.

242
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,465
They don't feed you
in here?

243
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:58,164
Oh God.
Good to see you.

244
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:02,163
Let me look
at you.

245
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:08,174
How you doing?

246
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:10,512
l mean about Andrew?

247
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:13,177
l miss him.

248
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,813
But before he
got clipped,

249
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,823
we weren't hanging
as much together.

250
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,654
All the freaks
he'd be with,

251
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:21,751
dragging a nigger
from the back of a truck?

252
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,785
What is that shit?

253
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:28,233
Well, come on,
sit down.

254
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:29,894
So much l want
to talk to you about.

255
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:32,563
Well, l'd love
that, but l mean, l've got to bolt.

256
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:37,137
Hank, you--
you just got here.

257
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,643
Hank.

258
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:41,340
Yeah, you know,
fuck it.

259
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,348
l got time.

260
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:44,940
l mean,

261
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:47,282
you're my daddy,
right?

262
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:57,326
How'd it go?

263
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:59,729
Well, it started
out kind of bizarre,

264
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:01,733
but Hank eventually
settled down.

265
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:05,259
- And Schillinger?
- l've never actually seen him happy.

266
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,932
But that's what
he seems to be.

267
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:09,702
He asked Hank
to come back.

268
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,472
Hank said yes, but whether he shows up
is anybody's guess.

269
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,570
l'll make sure
he does.

270
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:18,140
You know, the most
startling thing for me

271
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:20,618
is how much Schillinger
truly loves this kid.

272
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,781
- Father.
- Yeah?

273
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,724
Have you ever loved
anybody too much?

274
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:32,260
Of course.
You're not allowed.

275
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,596
l mean,
the celibacy thing.

276
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,567
l guess my question is,

277
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:39,935
is it wrong to love
somebody too much?

278
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:44,774
Well l guess that depends
on how the love manifests itself.

279
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,947
And the answer
to your first question is

280
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,084
yes, l have.

281
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:01,459
You've got to pity the guy who had
one thing go wrong his whole life.

282
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:05,362
l mean, other than that one thing
that got fucked up,

283
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:07,662
he led a good,
average life.

284
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,531
But some incident
or other,

285
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,695
some bad decision

286
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:14,706
or bad behavior, which maybe gained
him a moment of notoriety,

287
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,675
that'll be the headline
in his obit when he dies.

288
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,008
You know, like,
Charles van Doren,

289
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,444
''Quiz Show Scandal.''

290
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,141
No matter what else
he's done,

291
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:24,877
that's how he'll
be remembered

292
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,283
forever and ever.

293
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,052
Sorry.

294
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,194
- She yours?
- My girlfriend.

295
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,365
Oh yeah?
My wife.

296
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:02,744
The lieutenant wants
an update.

297
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:05,279
He wants to know
when he's going to see some arrests.

298
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:16,128
The shooting has brought
everything to a complete standstill.

299
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:20,195
Two of the guys on my initial drug
connections got killed.

300
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,699
Take it slow,
partner.

301
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:30,277
l know,
l know.

302
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:32,511
But l gotta
tell you,

303
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,486
l don't want to spend any more time
in this place than l have to.

304
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,924
l miss my wife
constantly.

305
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:56,574
And lately, l--

306
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,270
l feel like
l'm losing her.

307
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:02,042
Think she's sleeping
with another guy?

308
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:05,983
No, l'm just
becoming

309
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:07,986
less and less
important to her.

310
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,318
She's filling
in the space that l left.

311
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:13,450
That could never happen
to Kina and me.

312
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:16,950
- No?
- No.

313
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,897
Yeah, we'll see.

314
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,058
Where's she from?

315
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,534
DC.

316
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,537
Really?

317
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:27,539
Why?

318
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:29,541
She looked
familiar to me.

319
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:32,510
l was trying to figure
out from where.

320
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:33,876
How long she been
in the city?

321
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:37,041
Six months
or so.

322
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:40,779
l definitely
don't know her.

323
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,810
All right, man.
All right!

324
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:44,846
Hey Kina,

325
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,019
did you ever have any run-ins
with a guy named Augustus Hill?

326
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,631
Yeah, l thought so.
He says he recognized you.

327
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:58,899
l think, to be safe,
you shouldn't come visit for awhile.

328
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:01,566
Uh-huh.

329
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:11,713
You know, in Jamaica,
l worked the life.

330
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,412
- Yeah?
- Maybe you have a place for me.

331
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:17,854
So many of your men
were killed.

332
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:25,059
Let me speak
to some people.

333
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,558
Mr. Adebisi.

334
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:55,685
Nice island,

335
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,288
- Jamaica.
- You've been?

336
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,031
l ask the questions.

337
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,662
Understood.

338
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,331
How is Junior Numbah doing?

339
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:09,204
l know who he is,

340
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:10,902
but we have never
danced together.

341
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,911
Marco Sauri?

342
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:15,607
Again,
l know of him.

343
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:17,775
William Pouches?

344
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:20,683
Him l don't
know at all.

345
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:24,481
That's because
l made him up.

346
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:27,118
You know Aylum King?

347
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:29,787
Barely.

348
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,124
Then who do
you know?

349
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:34,792
Who can vouch
for you?

350
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,960
Nesta Parks.

351
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:41,706
Nesta Parks?

352
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:45,010
He's in Levin.

353
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:47,911
Serving 15 years.

354
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,211
You can go now.

355
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,809
Give me a chance
to prove myself.

356
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,842
Go.

357
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,553
Poet,

358
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,530
contact Nesta Parks.

359
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:09,693
l want to hear stories
about our new monkey.

360
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:15,368
- So the trial starts today.
- Yes.

361
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,510
And l plan
to go to court

362
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:20,569
and be there every day
until we get justice.

363
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:22,773
Oh and you're
certain that we will get justice.

364
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:25,716
l have a very good
feeling about this.

365
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:28,151
l think we're
going to win.

366
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:30,553
l think the State
and this prison

367
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:33,057
and Devlin are gonna have
to finally face the facts

368
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:35,060
that after all
these years,

369
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:36,823
they were responsible
for the riot.

370
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:38,523
Well, they
were responsible

371
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:40,429
for all the inmates
who were injured.

372
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:42,297
And the men,

373
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:44,302
like my brother,
who died.

374
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:47,405
You're laughing
at me?

375
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,407
No, l'm not
laughing at you.

376
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:52,274
l just remember the frightened
little girl that you were.

377
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,302
And l'm stunned.

378
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,683
l'm very pleased

379
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,708
at all the changes
within you.

380
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:05,254
l wanna kiss you.

381
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,897
l wish we could.

382
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:15,832
You know what?

383
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:18,496
Everything that
l respect about you

384
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:21,165
also really
pisses me off.

385
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,518
Okay.
l've asked you all here today,

386
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:35,144
because as co-plaintiffs,

387
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:37,155
l'm going to give
you an update

388
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:39,180
on the lawsuit
against the State.

389
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:41,317
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We saw that on the news.

390
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,760
When do we get
our fucking money?

391
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:45,764
As l have said,
O'Reily,

392
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:47,959
this is not
about money.

393
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,458
This is about the State
admitting culpability in the riot.

394
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:53,994
Excuse me,
will each of us be testifying?

395
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,529
l doubt it.

396
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:57,542
l have all
of your depositions.

397
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:59,373
And our lawyer,
Arnie Zelman,

398
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,174
he believes that only
one of us is necessary

399
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:03,340
to plead our case
in court.

400
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:05,213
And that someone
would be you.

401
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,016
Yes.
l leave in an hour.

402
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:11,386
lt's taking all these months
for the trial to start.

403
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,914
How long before
the jury reaches a verdict?

404
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,984
l would say about a week.

405
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:17,996
Well, aren't we
feeling optimistic?

406
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,692
Given the fact that l believe
the American legal system

407
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:22,700
to be inherently corrupt,

408
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:25,032
unfair, chaotic--

409
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,038
oh yes.

410
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:29,563
l'm feeling
very optimistic.

411
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:39,307
- Take it away.
- Kareem.

412
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:42,377
- No, l absolutely refuse.
- lt's a new statewide requirement.

413
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,389
Whenever a prisoner
leaves a facility,

414
00:25:44,423 --> 00:25:46,391
he or she must put on
an orange jumpsuit.

415
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:49,053
And if l wear that into court,
how do you think the jury will see me?

416
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:51,062
They will see me
as a criminal,

417
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:53,064
and that is someone who
is not to be believed.

418
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:54,588
You can't leave Oz
without it.

419
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,397
Go to the Board
of Prisons

420
00:25:57,436 --> 00:26:00,234
- You get me a waiver.
- l tried.

421
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:02,069
Then you sue
the Board of Prisons.

422
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:04,473
Fine, and maybe
Judge Dolov will delay the proceedings

423
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:07,569
or maybe he won't. ln any case, the
legal haggling is going to eat up time.

424
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:09,604
l thought you wanted
this over as soon as possible.

425
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,115
You know
what l want?

426
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:13,709
l want this trial
done right.

427
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:16,380
Okay.

428
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:18,480
l'll file
the proper motions.

429
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,936
Hey.

430
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,370
- Hey.
- Back so soon?

431
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:37,967
Yeah. There was
a complication.

432
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,602
There always is
with you.

433
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,704
What did you mean
by that?

434
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:43,476
Well, you say

435
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:45,983
you're not in this for the money
and l believe that.

436
00:26:47,252 --> 00:26:49,220
You say you are
in it for justice

437
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:51,415
and l think there's
something else involved.

438
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:55,689
l think you want
this case to fail.

439
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:58,992
lf the jury rejects
our lawsuit,

440
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:01,295
then you'll be able
to point with righteous indignation

441
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,324
at a system
that doesn't work.

442
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:05,928
But if we succeed,
then what do you have?

443
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:08,769
What can you
rage against?

444
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,367
So you'll do anything

445
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,275
to find a complication.

446
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:15,803
l will not be made
a slave to

447
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:17,940
by the laws
of this state, Beecher.

448
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:21,783
Yeah, well, that's where
you and l are different.

449
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,788
Because l love
the law.

450
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:26,586
Even though
it didn't work in my favor

451
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,593
and l ended up
in here,

452
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:30,959
l thank God every night
for the laws we have.

453
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:32,964
Because it keeps
people like

454
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,966
Adebisi and Hernandez
and Schillinger

455
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,628
away from my children.

456
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,933
You know what?

457
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:41,997
l'm gonna tell Zelman
that if he needs me to

458
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,032
l'm gonna testify
instead of you.

459
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,576
Beecher!

460
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:54,312
Beecher's testimony
about physical abuse

461
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:57,151
by guards at Oswald, before and after
the riot, stunned the jury.

462
00:27:57,189 --> 00:28:00,920
- Beecher, look.
- How is Beecher doing this?

463
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:04,486
Beecher claims that even after
the SORT team had gained control,

464
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,429
prisoners were tortured.

465
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:09,195
This is Kevin Gersten,
reporting from the courthouse.

466
00:28:30,722 --> 00:28:32,690
- You Mrs. Lazarus?
- Yes.

467
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:35,318
l got word someone
was waiting to see me.

468
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,294
l'm sorry,
do l know you?

469
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:39,320
No. Yes.

470
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,764
l was one of the jurors
at your trail.

471
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:45,702
Oh, you came to make sure
l was being punished?

472
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,705
No, l--

473
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,798
there is something
that has been haunting me

474
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:51,433
ever since you
were convicted.

475
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:52,943
What, you think
l'm innocent?

476
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:54,570
Oh, l know
you're guilty.

477
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:56,205
l know you killed
that young man

478
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:58,876
and cut off his head
and tried to ship it Airborne Express.

479
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:01,886
That is what makes
this whole thing so hard.

480
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,683
l am a Christian.

481
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:06,418
l know the difference between
what is God's will and what isn't.

482
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,119
l know that everyone
is owed a fair trial

483
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,253
and that means being
judged without prejudice.

484
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,490
Lady, what are you
jabbering about?

485
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:16,194
At your trial,
you were not judged without prejudice.

486
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:19,670
So then Mrs. Lazarus says
after the jury got sequestered

487
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:23,003
one of the other jurors,
a redneck motherfucker

488
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,633
announced to everybody,

489
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,644
''This shouldn't take long.

490
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:28,646
This guy's a fag.
All fags should be dead.''

491
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,513
Then he proceeds to bully
the rest of them, accusing anyone

492
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,452
who wanted to discuss my case
of being a fag.

493
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,955
Mrs. Lazarus says this juror
got them all to vote guilty

494
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:39,718
based solely on the fact
that l'm gay.

495
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:42,659
- Jesus.
- What are you gonna do?

496
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:44,662
l figure l've got
a shot at getting

497
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,891
the guilty
verdict overturned.

498
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:48,923
Maybe get a new trial.

499
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:52,368
Maybe get the fuck
out of here.

500
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:02,436
Hey, Mr. Said?

501
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:05,606
May we talk?

502
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:09,748
What is it that you and l could possibly
have to talk about?

503
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:11,756
Oh, you mean
because l'm queer?

504
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,282
And you Muslims
consider homosexuality

505
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:17,295
an abomination?

506
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:20,321
Yes.
There you have it.

507
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,894
Would you say you're prejudiced
against me?

508
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,004
No.

509
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,008
l pray every day

510
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:33,806
for your kind to find their way
to God.

511
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:36,405
Seems to me that makes you all
the more prejudiced.

512
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,882
l mean l'm not going
around asking Allah

513
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,908
to turn you
into a faggot.

514
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:48,718
What is it that you want?

515
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:52,060
Justice.

516
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,824
Shirley Bellinger's
execution has been set

517
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:26,854
for two weeks
from Thursday.

518
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:31,531
Now execution brings us
a lot of undue attention

519
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,299
from the media,
from protesters.

520
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,533
Shirley
is the first woman

521
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:39,476
to be executed in this state since
18-something or other, so

522
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:41,502
we're going to eat
more shit than usual.

523
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:43,514
- Warden?
- Yeah, Lopresti.

524
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:46,381
lf you're going to have TV cameras
up in death row,

525
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:49,114
you might want to think about having
the place painted.

526
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:52,223
Okay, all right.

527
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:54,248
l'll put somebody on it.
Anything else?

528
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,858
Shirley.

529
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:08,896
Good morning,
Officer Lopresti.

530
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,500
And who is this
fine gentleman?

531
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:13,875
Ralph Galino.
He's going to paint your cell.

532
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:15,106
How do you do?

533
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:17,239
Well, the truth be told,
l'm a little pissed off.

534
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:18,909
On the outside,
l was a contractor.

535
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,679
A housing complex
l built collapsed,

536
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,619
killed two people.
But it wasn't my fault.

537
00:32:22,654 --> 00:32:25,122
l used
to supervise painters,

538
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:27,852
l never painted.

539
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,292
Somehow the warden
decided l was qualified.

540
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:32,626
Enough yapping, get to work.
Shirley, you can step out.

541
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:34,495
- Step out?
- Yeah.

542
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:36,500
The warden decided
you're free

543
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:38,502
to roam around here
until Galino's done.

544
00:32:38,536 --> 00:32:41,562
Tell Mr. Glynn
l'm much obliged.

545
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:45,509
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- No problem.

546
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:47,511
l'm so sorry.

547
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:49,513
How are you
today, Nat?

548
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:51,515
Just fine, honey lamb.

549
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:53,517
What are you working on?

550
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:56,816
- A new dress.
- Fucking girlie queer bait.

551
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:58,789
Oh that pierces me
to the very bone.

552
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:01,758
Especially coming from a jizz-ball
who murdered his family.

553
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:14,370
- You murdered your family?
- Twice.

554
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:25,816
Prisoner #97M573,

555
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,818
Mark Miles;

556
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:30,480
Convicted
July 10th, 1997 ;

557
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:32,581
Three counts of murder
in the first degree.

558
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,592
Sentence: death.

559
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:36,594
You murdered two
of your families?

560
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:38,493
My, my.

561
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,623
That makes me feel like
a downright amateur.

562
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,302
20 years ago,

563
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:46,600
l shot my wife
and my son.

564
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:49,801
l pleaded insanity, served 10 years
in the Conley lnstitute.

565
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:52,969
- l was cured.
- Fucking psychopath.

566
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:55,946
Well that's the pot
calling the kettle black, boy.

567
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,448
- Don't be fucking calling me ''boy.''
- Fuck you.

568
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:01,316
Gentlemen, please no ruckus.
At least wait until l'm dead.

569
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:05,012
- They set the date yet?
- Two weeks.

570
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:07,753
That don't fuck
with your head?

571
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,192
No.

572
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:13,254
After all the bullshit,
the trial, the appeals,

573
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,789
the miscarriage,
l'm ready to go.

574
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:19,628
l am ready
to meet my maker.

575
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,639
Of course,
whether he's ready

576
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:23,664
for the likes of me
is another story.

577
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,444
When you smile,

578
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:31,847
you are a very
attractive man.

579
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:36,119
For a nigger?

580
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:38,145
l admit, l have had
my prejudices.

581
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,859
But now that l am
so close to the end,

582
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:44,054
l see that

583
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:46,063
all of us is the same.

584
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:48,065
Same needs,

585
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:50,795
same desires.

586
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,928
- Yo, Lopresti!
- Hey, hey, hey!

587
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:54,939
What's going on here?

588
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:57,168
Just a little
fraternization.

589
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,403
That is not on
the goddamn program.

590
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:02,607
- Done.
- Good. Get inside.

591
00:35:05,016 --> 00:35:07,211
Careful of the fumes,
you might get high.

592
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:09,243
l'm looking
forward to it.

593
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:12,814
Hey.

594
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:15,325
Hey, Pete, l was just
gonna come find you.

595
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,191
Oh yeah?

596
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,822
l had dinner last night
with Preston's parents.

597
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:22,424
lt's been awhile
since l'd seen them.

598
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:24,901
Anyway, l mentioned
your interaction program.

599
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:27,632
Really?

600
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:29,299
How'd they react?

601
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,332
Patricia seemed more intrigued
by the idea than Lars.

602
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:34,709
Would you like me
to call them?

603
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:39,583
Nope. l convinced them
to participate.

604
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,482
You?

605
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,977
l always had a really
good relationship with them

606
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:49,619
even though Preston married
outside of his religion,

607
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:51,629
outside his tribe.

608
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:53,130
lt's funny,

609
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:55,462
during dinner
Patricia kept saying,

610
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,593
''lt's not like we
blame you, Gloria.''

611
00:35:57,635 --> 00:36:01,071
Which, of course, means that they do
blame me for Preston's death,

612
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:04,404
only they're too WASP
to be confrontational.

613
00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:10,740
And then l realized
that l blame myself, too.

614
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:21,283
Cyril, stop that.
Put that down.

615
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:25,024
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

616
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:29,432
Cyril, you do understand that you
may have to talk to the mother,

617
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:32,027
the father and wife
of the man you killed.

618
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,903
Yes.

619
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:37,567
Dr. Nathan.

620
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,577
l like her.

621
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:42,944
When you meet them,

622
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:45,381
do you know what you
might want to say?

623
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:50,454
That--

624
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:52,820
that l want
to be their friend.

625
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:59,990
Ryan, how about you,
what do you want to say?

626
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,931
Hey, we're not here
for me.

627
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:04,230
We're here to cure him
of those nightmares.

628
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:06,794
No, no, no.
We're here to help you too.

629
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:09,466
l think you might
want to talk about

630
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:11,304
getting diagnosed
for breast cancer,

631
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:14,641
about how frightening
that was,

632
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,476
how kind Gloria was,

633
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:18,914
and how you developed
feelings for her,

634
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,078
and how that led to you having
Cyril murder Preston.

635
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,955
l still love her.
l do.

636
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:31,894
And that ain't never
going to go away.

637
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:47,004
Fuck!

638
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,476
l don't understand
why it's still bleeding.

639
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:58,421
Maybe Dr. Nathan should
take a look at it.

640
00:37:58,456 --> 00:38:01,823
- What do you say?
- Dr. Nathan's gone for a few hours.

641
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:06,353
l think l'll see
if l can find Dr. Prestopnik.

642
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:08,388
Oh, fuck.

643
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,329
Sister Peter Marie,

644
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,167
l'd like you to meet
Lars and Patricia Nathan.

645
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:16,002
Hello.
Welcome.

646
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,032
- Thank you.
- Weren't you at Preston's funeral?

647
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:23,070
Yes, we spoke very briefly.
l wasn't sure if you'd remember.

648
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:25,742
l remember everything
about that day.

649
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:27,648
Why don't we all
sit down?

650
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:36,157
When Gloria asked us
about coming here,

651
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:37,855
l have to admit
l was skeptical.

652
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:41,422
l'm not sure
what good it'll do

653
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:43,764
bringing up
all those feelings again.

654
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:46,099
The bottom line, Lars,

655
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:49,163
is that by facing the men responsible
for your son's death,

656
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:51,767
you have the opportunity
to express things

657
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:55,142
- you might not otherwise get to say.
- That's what l told him.

658
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,773
Right, so from now
until then

659
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:00,716
we'll have a series
of conversations to help prepare you

660
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,982
for meeting
the O'Reily brothers.

661
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:06,388
Now at times the process
might seem slow,

662
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:08,358
frustrating,

663
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,258
even counterproductive--

664
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:12,228
We can drop out
at any time.

665
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:14,527
Yes, but ultimately

666
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:17,534
the experience can be
very satisfying

667
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:23,333
Let's get started.

668
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:25,842
What's the single most
important thing you want

669
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:27,868
to ask Cyril and Ryan?

670
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:38,147
Why did you murder my baby?

671
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:50,027
- Hey.
- Ryan?

672
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:51,831
Why do you use
the payphone?

673
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,700
To call out, Cyril.
That's why.

674
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,831
Why don't you use
your cell thing?

675
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:58,842
You mean
a cell phone?

676
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:01,743
'Cause they're illegal in Oz.
They're against the rules.

677
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:07,309
Then why does the man
who talks funny have one?

678
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:09,148
What man who talks funny?

679
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:11,747
Everyone in this shithole
talks funny, Cyril.

680
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:14,883
Him.

681
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:23,526
Stanislofsky's got
a cell phone?

682
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:26,401
- l saw him talking on it.
- Really?

683
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:29,804
Fuck.

684
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:33,200
You wait here, okay?
l'll be right back.

685
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:45,089
Nikolai.

686
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:47,091
Nikolai, Nikolai.

687
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,286
How's it hanging
there, buddy?

688
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,818
O'Reily.
Always a pleasure to see you.

689
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,728
Yeah, right.

690
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:56,290
You know, a little birdie
told me a secret about you

691
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:58,427
and l just came by
to see if it was true or not.

692
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:01,605
You got a cell phone?

693
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,698
No.

694
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:05,504
Well l guess
that's what l get

695
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:07,340
for listening
to little birdies, huh?

696
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:09,573
Because if you did
have a cell phone,

697
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:12,606
you'd let me borrow it.
You'd share, right?

698
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:15,779
Share?
Hmm.

699
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,947
Rent, maybe.

700
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:20,253
lf l had one,

701
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,952
which l don't.

702
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:24,484
l know. You told me
and l believe you.

703
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:28,522
Because that's just
the kind of trust that we have.

704
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:31,558
Yes.
Absolutely.

705
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:35,561
Well, l'm sorry
to disturb you.

706
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:38,666
Not a problem.

707
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:41,701
Bye, Nikolai.

708
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:49,585
There you go, Niko.

709
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,611
Eat hearty.

710
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:55,619
Yo, Pancamo.

711
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,060
My brother's sick.
l gotta get him back to Em City.

712
00:41:58,095 --> 00:41:59,824
We're right in the middle
of fuckin' lunch.

713
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:01,491
l don't get him
back to Em City now,

714
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:03,727
he's going to blow chunks
right into that salad bowl.

715
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:05,326
Okay, okay.
Go, get him out of here.

716
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,394
Cyril. You all right?
Come on.

717
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:09,429
You feeling all right?
Come on, let's go.

718
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:23,887
But l--
l feel good, Ryan.

719
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:26,014
Shut up.

720
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:28,890
Stand here. Tell me if you see
Stanislofsky coming.

721
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:43,907
Fuck.

722
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:45,568
You fucking cocksucker.

723
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,601
Where's your fuckin' phone?

724
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:00,390
Couldn't find it,
could you?

725
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:03,723
- Find what?
- The cell phone.

726
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:06,457
Cell phone? l thought you said
you had no cell phone.

727
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:08,021
l don't.

728
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:10,590
Then how could l look for something
that doesn't exist?

729
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:12,899
Exactly.

730
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:34,447
- What's up, Jizz?
- Fuck you.

731
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:38,094
- Hey Ralph.
- What do you want?

732
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:40,529
Jesus, can't a guy
just be friendly?

733
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:42,725
l been here for days
and you ain't been friendly.

734
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:45,395
Well, that's why l'm here--
to make up for my lack of manners.

735
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,427
You mind if l sit?

736
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:53,099
Jesus, this mattress sucks.

737
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,203
Hard adjusting to life
in Oz, isn't it?

738
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:57,544
Especially with that jizz-bag
roommate of yours?

739
00:43:57,581 --> 00:43:59,446
Hoyt? Hoyt is a pig.
l don't even know why

740
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:02,646
they moved me in here
after that French guy died.

741
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,678
You know what
the hardest part is?

742
00:44:04,722 --> 00:44:07,520
Getting used to life
without all the trimmings.

743
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:10,459
l'm talking about sex,

744
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:12,792
a good cigar,

745
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,560
a fine bottle of vino,
a cell phone.

746
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,363
l didn't know
that cell phones weren't allowed.

747
00:44:18,402 --> 00:44:19,892
Stanislofsky
set me straight.

748
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:23,303
Ralph, you grow
up in America?

749
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:25,104
Yeah.

750
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:27,372
Growing up, what was
the one enemy we had,

751
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:30,005
the one country that
we never trusted?

752
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:35,115
- Russia.
- Yeah.

753
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:37,882
Now, Stanislofsky, he's...

754
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,458
- Russian?
- Right.

755
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:44,359
He was telling you the truth
about not being allowed cells

756
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:47,387
but instead of turning yours in,
he kept yours for himself.

757
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,423
- Fucking cocksucker!
- lf l were you,

758
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:52,459
l'd go take back
what was mine.

759
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:02,011
Hey, you fuck.
l want my cell phone back.

760
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:03,673
Lower your voice.

761
00:45:03,714 --> 00:45:05,181
Fuck you.
l want it.

762
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,616
You think l carry the thing
around with me?

763
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:10,915
l have to get it
from the hiding place.

764
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:12,980
lt will take time.

765
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:15,492
Okay.

766
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:19,087
l want the cell phone
in my hand by lights out.

767
00:45:41,652 --> 00:45:43,449
Mr. Pancamo.

768
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,478
A question.

769
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:47,388
Ralph Galino.
ls he a friend of yours?

770
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:49,757
We don't associate.

771
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:53,521
So if he were ill,

772
00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:56,761
or hurt
in an accident?

773
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:59,895
l don't care if that motherfucker
lives or dies.

774
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:26,792
Where the fuck are you going?
And don't tell me Cyril's sick.

775
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:28,594
- But l gotta do--
- The only thing you gotta do

776
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:30,691
is go back to work,
or l'll have you and your brother

777
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:32,395
transferred up
to making ladies' dresses.

778
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:34,165
- But l got to--
- Get to fucking work.

779
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:36,196
You got yourself
a deal.

780
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:15,141
That motherfucker!
Fuck!

781
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:20,940
You looking for Galino?

782
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:25,519
He went for a walk
with Hoyt.

783
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,090
Looks to me
like an OD.

784
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:40,093
Let's get him
to the morgue.

785
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:54,879
You played
this one well.

786
00:47:54,919 --> 00:47:57,251
You covered all
the bases,

787
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:59,722
kept your
hands clean.

788
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:03,056
No one knows about the cell phone,
so no one suspects you.

789
00:48:03,093 --> 00:48:04,924
That's nice.

790
00:48:04,962 --> 00:48:06,862
l think l underestimated you,
Nikolai,

791
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:09,730
and l don't usually
do that.

792
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,962
Listen, we could drag
this thing out,

793
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:14,732
go to war,
but you know

794
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,036
eventually
l'd win.

795
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:19,269
So l say
let's just work together.

796
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,211
Like Russia and the US.
What was that called again?

797
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:24,942
Detente.

798
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:27,143
Detente.
Exactly.

799
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:29,175
What do
you say?

800
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:02,881
Miguel.

801
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:06,580
Miguel?

802
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:08,922
- Where am l?
- You're in the hospital ward.

803
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:10,950
Do you remember
what happened?

804
00:49:14,031 --> 00:49:16,829
You were both stabbed
by William Giles.

805
00:49:20,037 --> 00:49:22,028
Bevilaqua's dead.

806
00:49:25,042 --> 00:49:27,909
You know, l promised
myself l'd never get stuck again,

807
00:49:27,945 --> 00:49:31,904
and that little freak
Giles gets me.

808
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:36,512
What's with these?

809
00:49:36,553 --> 00:49:38,885
Standard procedure
for anyone from solitary.

810
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:53,196
Chico, Chico,
Chico,

811
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:55,034
you fucking
disappoint me.

812
00:49:55,072 --> 00:49:56,835
Why, El Cid?

813
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:59,638
l ask you to kill
Miguel Alvarez.

814
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:01,736
- ls he dead?
- No.

815
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:03,440
l don't like that
word, ''No.''

816
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,540
Carlos Martinez is in
the bed next to Alvarez.

817
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,551
But he's having trouble
getting a weapon.

818
00:50:08,585 --> 00:50:11,145
l don't give a fuck
if his mother's in bed next to him,

819
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:14,316
get the fucking job done
or l'll find me another lieutenant.

820
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:17,418
Get the fuck out
of my face, now.

821
00:50:44,188 --> 00:50:46,656
You having fun?

822
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:50,650
How you doing there Alvarez?

823
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:52,252
l heard what happened.

824
00:50:52,296 --> 00:50:55,265
- How's Emerald City doing?
- Scary.

825
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:56,994
l'm in constant fear.

826
00:50:57,034 --> 00:50:58,592
What are you gonna do?

827
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:01,368
Dig.

828
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:03,839
What?

829
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:06,809
Dig.

830
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:09,711
- You're digging another tunnel?
- Shh.

831
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:10,941
l'm almost done.

832
00:51:10,981 --> 00:51:13,449
You're a crazy fuck.

833
00:51:13,484 --> 00:51:15,247
You say that tomorrow,

834
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:17,276
you'll be saying it
to my backside.

835
00:51:55,959 --> 00:51:58,985
Prisoner #98M232,

836
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:00,792
Carlos Martinez;

837
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:03,994
Convicted October 6th,
1998;

838
00:52:04,034 --> 00:52:06,059
Two counts,
murder in the first degree.

839
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:09,072
Sentence: life without
the possibility of parole.

840
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:37,324
Fuck! Help!

841
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:38,698
Help!

842
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:40,293
Put it down,
Martinez!

843
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,703
There's no way
out so put the shank down, now!

844
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:44,331
Fuck you, bitch.

845
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:47,501
Down, motherfucker!

846
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:03,992
Count!

847
00:53:04,027 --> 00:53:07,292
88K214,
95H522,

848
00:53:07,331 --> 00:53:09,731
96G415,

849
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:11,495
98T304,

850
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:13,628
65R814,

851
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,934
98B242.

852
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:18,203
98B242!

853
00:53:19,443 --> 00:53:21,741
- Where is he, Rebadow?
- l don't know.

854
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:24,508
Don't bullshit me.
You guys are joined at the brain.

855
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:28,006
- Where's Busmalis?
- l really have no idea.

856
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:32,720
Check the log.
Where was he last?

857
00:53:32,756 --> 00:53:34,383
On work detail

858
00:53:34,424 --> 00:53:36,415
- mopping the hospital.
- l'll go check.

859
00:53:46,537 --> 00:53:49,995
Busmalis, where are you?

860
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:17,594
Great!
Just great!

861
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:19,625
Central, this is 214.

862
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:22,070
We got a 69,
hospital unit.

863
00:54:22,105 --> 00:54:24,164
Roger, copy that, over.

864
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:48,923
Ultimately, l guess it don't matter
what they write in your obituary,

865
00:54:48,966 --> 00:54:51,332
because you ain't gonna
be around to read it.

866
00:54:51,368 --> 00:54:54,496
Newsprint fades,
paper turns to pulp.

867
00:54:54,538 --> 00:54:57,769
The mark you leave behind
has to be deeper.

868
00:54:57,808 --> 00:55:00,140
The mark you leave behind

869
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:02,304
has to be on
another person's soul.
