Mr. Civello, I'd like your presence
in the back room, if you got a moment.

172
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:18,106
What, you mean you request my presence
for a moment or two in the back room?

173
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,399
I most certainly do.

174
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,942
Well, after you.

175
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,569
- No, after you.
- No, after you.

176
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,905
- Hey, Mr. Civello, after you.
- No, after you.

177
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,866
- In the back!
SARAH: Ha, ha, ha.

178
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,619
Tony, give them whatever they want.

179
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,122
JOHNNY:
Hey, girls. Hey, girls, excuse me.

180
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,749
Tony, keep an eye
on these nice girls here.

181
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,043
Don't let none of the vultures look, okay?

182
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,462
JOHNNY: What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

183
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,756
- What are you doing to me?
- What do you mean?

184
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,342
CHARLIE: Michael's on my back all night.
He's bothering me.

185
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,803
Why didn't you make your payment
last Tuesday?

186
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,556
I made my payment.
What are you talking about?

187
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,933
- You paid him last week?
- Yeah, I paid him.

188
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,103
What did he say, I didn't pay?
He's a fucking liar. Where is he?

189
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,397
- You paid him?
- Yeah, I paid him.

190
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,316
- Last week?
- Yeah!

191
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,902
- Last Tuesday?
- Yeah.

192
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,029
- You don't know...
- He's here.

193
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,822
- Where?
- Out front.

194
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,198
- He's here?
- Yeah.

195
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,658
So, what do I care?

196
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,870
Let me go get him.
We'll straighten this thing out, all right?

197
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,788
Hey, wait a minute, Charlie.

198
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,124
- What?
- Well, you're right.

199
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,502
- I'm right?
- Yeah, was it last Tuesday?

200
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,089
The Tuesday that was last week
that's before the one about to come up.

201
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:29,010
My mistake, I'm sorry. It was last week...
The week before that I was thinking of.

202
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,554
- Oh, yeah. It was, huh?
- That's right. That's right.

203
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,682
What's the matter with you?
You can't bullshit people that way.

204
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,643
You give your word, you gotta keep it.

205
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,520
You know what happened?
I'm depressed about other things.

206
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,606
I can't worry about payments, you know?

207
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,360
I come home last Tuesday. I had my money
in cash, you know? Blah-blah, bing-bing.

208
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,695
Coming home, I ran into Jimmy Sparks.

209
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,531
I owe him 700, like for four months.
I gotta pay the guy.

210
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,326
He lives in my building,
hangs out across the street.

211
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,744
- Yeah.
- So, what happened?

212
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,537
I had to give some to my mother.

213
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,706
I wound up with 25
at the end of the week.

214
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,292
And today, you won't believe,
it's just incredible.

215
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,211
- I can't believe it myself.
- What?

216
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,005
I was in a game.
I was ahead like 6-, 700 dollars, right?

217
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,800
- You're kidding?
- On Esther Street. You know Joey Clams?

218
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,009
Joey Scala, yeah.

219
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,054
- I know him too, yeah.
- No, Joey Scala is Joey Clams.

220
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,555
- Right.
- Right.

221
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,391
- They're the same person.
- Yeah.

222
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,017
- Hey.
- Hey.

223
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,562
So I was in there playing
bankers and brokers. All of a sudden...

224
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,107
...I'm ahead 6-, 700 dollars.
I'm really winning.

225
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:28,236
All of a sudden some kid walks in
and yells that the bulls are coming, right?

226
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,489
Cops are coming. Everybody runs away.
I grab the money. I go in.

227
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,241
It's an excuse, like to get away.

228
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,202
I'd give everybody the money later,
and that way I'd get out.

229
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,163
I don't have to get into the game
and get a losing streak.

230
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,791
I come out in the yard,
I don't know this building.

231
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,419
I couldn't get out. It was like a box.

232
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,629
Big, like this. So I gotta go back in.

233
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,717
Not only do I go back in,
but this kid says it's a false alarm.

234
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:55,054
Imagine that? I wanted to kill
this fucking kid. I mean, I want... Ugh!

235
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,181
I was so crazy, I wanted to kill this kid.

236
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:02,103
Meanwhile, I gotta get back in the game.
Bing-bing-bing. I lose $400.

237
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,605
Meanwhile, Frankie Bones is over there.

238
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,983
I owe him 1300 for seven,
eight months already.

239
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,986
I can't walk on Esther Street
without ducking that guy.

240
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,822
He's, like, waiting for me.
Like I can't move, you know.

241
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,700
He sees that I'm losing, right?
So he's waiting for me.

242
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,577
He's tapping me on the shoulder.

243
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,871
Tapping me like this. Like a hawk.

244
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,914
"You're losing. Give me some money."

245
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:26,002
I say, "Frankie, come on. Give me a break
over here. Let me win some back.

246
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,171
I got debts. I'm in a big hole."

247
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,132
He says, "Never mind, give me the money."
I say, "Okay."

248
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,468
So I gave him 200.
Meanwhile, I lost the deal.

249
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,219
I go outside, I'm depressed...

250
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,056
I'll cut the story short.
You don't want to hear all this.

251
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,725
I know, I know, I know.
To make a long story short.

252
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,977
Anyway, I went to Al Kaplan.

253
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,272
Got a new tie, got this shirt.
You like the shirt?

254
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,815
It's nice. This tie...

255
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,736
Michael doesn't care if you're depressed.
What is he, your priest?

256
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,073
Why are you going shopping
when you owe money? That ain't right.

257
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,365
How much you got there?

258
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,701
I'm gonna pay him next week.
I'm gonna pay him!

259
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,871
You're gonna and you don't do nothing.
How much you got there?

260
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,916
I got about... I got another $40.

261
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,459
What are you doing?

262
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,464
I got about $40 there. That's all.

263
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,178
What? What are you doing?

264
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,598
I'm holding on to this till next week,
till you make the next payment.

265
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,934
What? There's a little more than 40?

266
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,769
- It's a mistake.
- Yeah, a mistake.

267
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,648
Hey, listen, I swear to my mother,
you come with me next Tuesday...

268
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,735
...I sign the paycheck over to you. I swear
to my mother, swear to Christ, okay?

269
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,862
Come on, it's $110.
You give it to Michael.

270
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,865
Come on, give me some money.
We got those beautiful girls.

271
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:42,120
We're gonna get laid.
I met those chicks in that Cafe Bizarre.

272
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,789
They were fucking around
with these two other guys.

273
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,709
That one, Weintraub, is very nice.
Very nice. I want to bang her like crazy.

274
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,211
Here.

275
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,255
- Come on.
- That's enough for you.

276
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,050
- Come on, give me another 5. Come on.
- Which one do you want?

277
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,096
You're leaving me nothing.
We gotta go eat chinks?

278
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,515
- Make do for this for the week.
- All right.

279
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,809
- Which one do you want?
- Which one do you want?

280
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,353
I want Weintraub.
She's nice. I like that one.

281
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,855
She's the one on the left?

282
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,941
No, she's the one... Your left or my left?

283
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,278
- We were both standing the same way.
- It don't matter.

284
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,322
JOHNNY: Hey, girls, we
had a little business

285
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,198
to talk over.
Everything's okay now.

286
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,117
Excuse me for a minute.

287
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,911
Hey, Tony, you think maybe
you could put this on the tab?

288
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,958
Because something happened before.
You'll be doing me a favor, you know?

289
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,460
- Huh?
- Big tab or the little tab?

290
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,006
Don't you think it's better
that you should put it on the small tab...

291
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,050
...so that it balances out
with the big tab?

292
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,220
- Oh, so things even out?
- Yeah, right.

293
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,265
Joey, where'd you get those beads?

294
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,350
How about me, John?
I don't get a drink?

295
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,936
- Hey, Mikey.
- Long time no see.

296
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,646
You don't get a drink?

297
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,441
- Does a bear shit in the woods over here?
CHARLIE: Ha, ha, ha.

298
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,692
Go ahead.

299
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,448
Give him a double.
Tony, give him a double.

300
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,451
- Long time no see.
JOHNNY: I know what you'll say, but don't.

301
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,287
One, I'm not paying for these drinks.
They're on the tab.

302
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,081
Two, I'll see youse Tuesday payday,
I swear on my mother.

303
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:13,461
Not on my mother,
but Jesus Christ and... Okay?

304
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,130
All right, I just wanna tell you
to stay on top of it.

305
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,382
- I will.
- We don't want it to get out of hand.

306
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,677
- Don't worry, it ain't gonna get
out of hand. - I'm doing it for you.

307
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,137
- Have a drink.
- Okay.

308
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,972
CHARLIE:
Gentlemen.

309
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,641
- The queen.
- The queen.

310
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,267
- Queen.
- Queen.

311
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,852
[JOHNNY HUMMING]

312
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,191
You know what the queen said?
"If I had balls I'd be the king."

313
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,151
MEN:
Ooh.

314
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,444
CHARLIE:
Tssh.

315
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,708
Hey, they told me you were here,
and you're here.

316
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,670
CHARLIE: Hey.
- How are you? How's the classes going?

317
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,506
Okay, Oscar.
How's everything going with you?

318
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,176
I was in the basement fixing the freezer.
Would you believe that?

319
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,763
Charlie, you're a good boy.
Will you tell your uncle I have nothing?

320
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,848
I can't make this week's payment.

321
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,560
Listen, you talk to Giovanni, not me.

322
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,147
I should hand this place over to him.
I don't need this aggravation.

323
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,693
He'd rather have the loan paid.
You know that, Oscar.

324
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,820
Your uncle's a good man.
I won't stick him.

325
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,114
He either gets the money
or he gets the place.

326
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,408
Right now it looks like
he's getting the place.

327
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,452
You tell me why I should care.
