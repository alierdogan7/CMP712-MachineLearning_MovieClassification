everything goes catawampus,

183
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:22,862
That's not your
typical Arabic name.

184
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:25,031
NELL:
He's been a commenter

185
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,399
on several
bomb-building Web sites,

186
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,851
including one called
"Jihadist Raiders Front""

187
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,203
His knowledge of munitions

188
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:33,188
and Rome's knowledge
of trains...

189
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,523
This could end badly.

190
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,375
<i>KENSI:
Rome's on the second floor.</i>

191
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:37,994
210.
Oh!

192
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:39,128
What? Something from ops?

193
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,496
My horoscope.

194
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:41,630
You have a horoscope app?

195
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:43,165
You wouldn't understand;
you're a Leo.

196
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,134
That's right, lion,
king of the jungle.

197
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,369
Full of fire and aggression,
has to be right,

198
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:48,370
even when she isn't.

199
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,972
Actually, especially
when she isn't.

200
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:51,474
And what does that make you?

201
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:52,675
I'm a Capricorn.

202
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,427
What is that,
the unicorn's inbred cousin?

203
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:55,811
The ram.

204
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:57,430
(laughs)

205
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:58,681
Really?
You're a goat?

206
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,232
No, no, that's a completely
different animal.

207
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:01,550
I'm the ram.

208
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:03,652
I see, so scruffy,
annoying bleat.

209
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:05,855
Uh, stable, steady,

210
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:08,190
loyal, connected
with the earth.

211
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:10,860
Also, Leos drive
Capricorns crazy.

212
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,728
Yes, well, apparently,
vice versa.

213
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,113
Slow down.

214
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:15,147
You slow down, goat boy.

215
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:16,582
No, no, no, 210.

216
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,584
DEEKS:
Hey, uh, sir?

217
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,536
Hey, did you sign for
a package earlier?

218
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:21,620
No...

219
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:23,289
No! Federal agents!

220
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,740
Federal agents!

221
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:35,751
(groaning)

222
00:08:37,137 --> 00:08:38,387
What's the rush?

223
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,639
I thought you were the guys
lived up there.

224
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:43,225
What part of "federal agents"
did you not understand?

225
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:45,094
Hey, I don't hear so good.

226
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:46,595
Yeah, what do you need this for?

227
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:48,314
A little
Smith & Wesson revolver?

228
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:49,815
What's up, old school?

229
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:51,934
I got a concealed weapons
carry permit

230
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:53,119
in my wallet.

231
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,620
Name's Anthony Trager.

232
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:57,039
private investigator.
He's telling the truth.

233
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,741
This guy's a private eye.

234
00:08:58,743 --> 00:08:59,825
(groans)
A little help?

235
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:00,910
Gumshoe,

236
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:03,045
a shamus,

237
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:04,246
a bird dog.

238
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:05,631
What's wrong with this guy?

239
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,249
He's in retrograde.

240
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,418
P.I.'s aren't supposed
to break into apartments.

241
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,120
I knocked; the door was open.

242
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:12,955
Retired LAPD? You a cop?
I'm a cop.

243
00:09:12,957 --> 00:09:14,840
Lawman,
blue knight, hot fuzz. open.

244
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:17,143
What is he, like,
Rain Man or something?

245
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:18,894
I wish; at least he could count.

246
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:22,464
So what are you guys?
FBI? Homeland Security?

247
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,016
NCIS.

248
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:26,602
I guess we're both interested
in Mitchell Rome.

249
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:28,437
Mm-hmm.
How's that, Dragnet?

250
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,305
I was hired
by Fillmore and Western.

251
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:33,075
He's been babbling
about dragging them into court

252
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,443
for wrongful termination
of employment.

253
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:36,028
I was looking
for any skeletons

254
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,864
in his closet that
might torpedo his case.

255
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,533
Easiest gig I ever had.

256
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:42,952
They guy's a real pothead.

257
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,004
Stoner, dope fiend,
smoke monkey.

258
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,091
You know what I'm talking about.

259
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,127
Midnight toker, see you later.

260
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:53,095
What the...?

261
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:04,607
DEEKS:
Wow.

262
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,982
Okay, so manuals,

263
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:15,067
routes, schematics.

264
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:17,519
He is either
a really dedicated employee...

265
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:19,655
Or a crazy and obsessive killer.

266
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,325
Oh, man, is that
what I think it is?

267
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:25,544
What?

268
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:28,631
Oh, my Godit is.

269
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,332
It's an Airfix HO-scale

270
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,635
262 Prairie Tank.

271
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:34,303
Excuse me?

272
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:35,971
They don't even
make these anymore.

273
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,540
And you know
this because...

274
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,676
Because I asked Santa

275
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:43,479
for it every single year,
and all I got was stupid Thomas.

276
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:44,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

277
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:45,898
Thomas is kind,

278
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,717
Thomas is dependable,
Thomas is not stupid.

279
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,186
Thomas has a face, all right?

280
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:52,554
Trains shouldn't have a face,
and they shouldn't talk.

281
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:54,857
We should all be so lucky.

282
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,578
Um, you wouldn't
happen to have

283
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,747
the bomb squad on speed dial,
would you?

284
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:03,949
What?

285
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:09,071
Looks like we got several bricks
of plastic explosives,

286
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:12,074
assorted blasting
caps and timers.

287
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:13,742
Highlighted rail maps
through Pasadena,

288
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:15,928
Long Beach and downtown L.A.

289
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,596
I'm gonna call it in.

290
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:19,682
These guys are getting
ready to strike.

291
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:22,384
I think I can, I think I can.

292
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,220
Kaboom.

293
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,610
ERIC: Homeland Security's
been briefed and all freight

294
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,146
and passenger security personnel
are on high alert.

295
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:40,398
And absolutely nothing
suspicious on Cheng,

296
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,949
the dead security guard.

297
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,318
And what about Gil Bellamy?

298
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,870
Rome took him in as a roommate
after he got fired,

299
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,155
probably to help pay the rent.

300
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:48,122
but I'm still digging through

301
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,357
his electronic footprint.

302
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,242
You sure this is
the right hospital?

303
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,994
Rome's mother was
off duty at 8:00.

304
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:54,045
Followed by two hours

305
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,346
of administrative meetings.

306
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,814
(indistinct chatter)

307
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,983
Here we go.

308
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,503
Jillian Rome?

309
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,372
Federal agents. Can we ask you
a couple questions?

310
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:07,258
I worked a night shift,
and I got a train to catch.

311
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,709
A train?

312
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:09,927
Yeah, I commute
from Diamond Bar.

313
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,646
Get a nap in both ways
and don't have to deal

314
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,431
with the traffic.
If this is about a patient,

315
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,350
maybe you could contact
the appropriate...?

316
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:16,768
We'd like to ask you
about your son.

317
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,552
You seen him lately?

318
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:21,239
No, um...

319
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,607
I... you know,
be-before he lost his job,

320
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,742
I used to talk to him
every day on the phone,

321
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,560
but now I'm lucky
if I get a text.

322
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:29,247
He's a suspect in a crime
at Fillmore and Western.

323
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,165
Mitch is not a criminal.

324
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,733
Do you know his roommate?

325
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,568
What roommate?

326
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,573
Look, m-my son is
a straight arrow.

327
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:42,427
I-I worked nights so I could be
with him every day after school.

328
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,178
He knows right from wrong.

329
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,413
According
to his former employer,

330
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:46,747
he had a marijuana problem.

331
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:48,549
No, no, that whole thing
was a mistake.

332
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,051
I mean, he doesn't even drink.

333
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:53,087
Mitch has loved trains
since he was in diapers.

334
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,140
He used to beg me to ride
in to work on the train.

335
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,776
It was his dream to
become an engineer.

336
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,978
There's absolutely no way

337
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,314
that he would throw
that all away.

338
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,283
There isn't.

339
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,819
If your son is innocent,

340
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,654
he may need protection

341
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,372
We need your help.

342
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,824
We'd like your permission
to access your cell phone

343
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,208
in case he calls.

344
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:17,044
Okay.

345
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,246
If you see him,

346
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:19,464
let us know?

347
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,748
I will.

348
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,950
Thank you.

349
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,389
That's a good mom.

350
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,640
Sounds like a good kid.

351
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,791
Yeah.

352
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:32,793
They said the same
thing about you.

353
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,113
(laughs)

354
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,319
I see the FRA has arrived.

355
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,187
Yes, we have.
Karen Bibb.

356
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,605
Yolanda Campbell,
operations manager.

357
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:45,639
Nice to meet you.

358
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,442
Matthew Dunkler.

359
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:49,160
(clears throat)

360
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,695
Matthew doesn't like
to shake hands.

361
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,996
Germs.

362
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,082
I wasn't expecting you
until this afternoon.

363
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,083
Ah, well,
we made good time.

364
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,251
Lack of freeway congestion
translated

365
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,370
into an average velocity
of 72 miles an hour.

366
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,122
That's great.

367
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:03,508
Right this way.

368
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,709
Uh, files are necessary
for all personnel on duty

369
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,093
during the time
of the incident.

370
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,512
Training qualifications,
hours of service,

371
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,014
uh, compliance training,
drug and alcohol screening,

372
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,933
medical exams.
It's all there.

373
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,634
Do you want
to inspect the tracks?

374
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:15,219
Uh, yes,
but after the paperwork.

375
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,505
Uh, interviews should be
scheduled for the engineer,

376
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:19,891
the conductor, the yard master
security dispatcher,

377
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:24,946
and once disengaged, the event
recorder should be queried.

378
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:25,947
(Deeks clears throat)

379
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,848
Matthew takes his job
very seriously.

380
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,816
I see.

381
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:31,402
Well, make yourselves
at home.

382
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,871
My office is right down the
hall, if you need anything,

383
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,689
and, uh, oh, for lunch,
there's a couple...

384
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:36,690
(clears throat loudly)

385
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,025
Not necessary.

386
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,293
All righty then.

387
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,528
I'll let you get to work.

388
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,829
Thank you.
Welcome.

389
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:44,198
(quietly):
Yeah.

390
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:46,867
What the hell?

391
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,886
What? I told you about
my undercover character.

392
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,805
Yeah, you told me he was
a by-the-book guy.

393
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,089
Not a weird and creepy guy.

394
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,391
Hey, it worked, didn't it?

395
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,809
She's leaving us alone.

396
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,511
(men arguing nearby)
Ooh.

397
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:58,513
MAN:
...the FRA is here...

398
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:00,848
MAN 2: No, they're not
expected till this afternoon.

399
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,050
(men continue arguing
indistinctly)

400
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:04,485
Hmm.

401
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,604
What are you doing?

402
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,072
(clears throat)

403
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,407
You should see this.

404
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,359
MAN: ...if they want
to check out the cabin.

405
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,577
They won't, trust me!

406
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,161
KENSI: Ah!

407
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,414
I've been shredding
on the railroad.

408
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,899
DEEKS:
A locked file.

409
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,034
Fascinating.

410
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:21,035
TRAGER:
The disk has everything.

411
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:23,371
Contraband
in Rome's apartment...

412
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:24,989
That's Trager.

413
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,707
Yeah, and photos with
the ex-con roommate.

414
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,544
The guy's got a rap sheet longer
than a Texas mile.

415
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:32,246
Pick up the pace.

416
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,599
There is a stairwell
around the corner.

417
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:38,386
TRAGER: Yeah, nobody's gonna touch that
kid's case with a ten-foot pole.

418
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:41,022
So, if you need anything else,
keep in touch.

419
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,090
(laughs)
You know where to find me.

420
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,725
Right around here
to the left.

421
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:45,693
To the left.

422
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,730
To the left, to the left...

423
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,765
Really?
They were right on our tail

424
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:52,950
in case you didn't notice.

425
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,068
75 cents for a tampon?

426
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,486
Those things used
to be a quarter

427
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,604
when I was in high school.

428
00:15:56,606 --> 00:15:58,105
KENSI:
He's gone.

429
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:00,791
We'll just wait
a few more minutes and...

430
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,244
Oh, crap.

431
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:04,962
You're a handsome devil--
what's your name?

432
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,049
(Deeks yelling)

433
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,451
Yeah, the twins have
a birthday party

434
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:11,952
and soccer on Saturday, so...

435
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:13,888
Most ladies buy me
a couple of drinks first.

436
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,972
(shushes)

437
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,257
Okay, sounds good, Mom.

438
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,143
Yeah, love you too.
Bye-bye.

439
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,479
Too many feet.

440
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,317
(yells)
Shh!

441
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,319
Molly, is that you?

442
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:32,356
No, it's Karen
from the FRA.

443
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,325
CAMPBELL:
Love your boots.

444
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,576
Thank you.

445
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,029
So, how long have you been
working with your partner?

446
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,615
Um, oh, I...

447
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:42,667
A couple years.

448
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,785
Well, you seem so normal,
but he's seems so...

449
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,004
Different?

450
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,089
Honey...

451
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,374
they ought to be
giving you hazard pay.

452
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,843
You have no idea.
(chuckles)

453
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,962
(toilet flushes)
Aah!

454
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,054
CALLEN:
Ivy League motel.

455
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:06,107
SAM:
So, Bellamy's been here before?

456
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,725
ERIC:
Credit card shows

457
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,529
charges for Harvard House Motel
twice in the last ten months.

458
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,481
Got it.

459
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,699
NELL:
And the stays coincide

460
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,068
with restraining orders
from two ex-girlfriends

461
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,570
after incidents
of domestic violence.

462
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,038
Sounds like a heck of a guy.

463
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,873
Yeah.
Hey, be careful over there.

464
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,458
We know: armed and dangerous.

465
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,994
Uh, no the motel ranks
number two in L.A.

466
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:29,130
on BedbugScorecard.com.

467
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,632
NELL: So, I'd consider
washing your clothes

468
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,668
on a fairly hot setting
after you leave.

469
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,670
Extra 20 minutes
in the dryer.

470
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,674
Have you seen this guy?

471
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:41,058
NELL:
Gil Bellamy.

472
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,678
He checked in three days ago
as Frank Babcock.

473
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,878
With a fake I.D.

474
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,014
Expired credit card last time.

475
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,683
I made him pay cash up front.

476
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:49,934
What room?

477
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,886
21. Need a key?

478
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:54,739
Rather not kick down the door.

479
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:57,358
Thank you.

480
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,398
Mr. Babcock,
the plumbers are here.

481
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,417
Your shower's leaking
through the floor!

482
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,703
You mind if we take
a look around?

483
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,097
(door creaking open)

484
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,750
Wire!

485
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,437
(car alarm blaring)

486
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,397
You all right?

487
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,001
Okay, thanks.

488
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,953
Forensics at the
motel found C-4.

489
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:55,037
Well, that's no surprise.

490
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,739
He's a construction
demolition guy.

491
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:58,240
We got a BOLO
out for Bellamy.

492
00:18:58,242 --> 00:19:01,544
And Jillian Rome has been
texting with her son.

493
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:03,713
"I'm okay, Mom,
don't believe it.

494
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:05,298
I'm doing the right thing."

495
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,217
If blowing up two federal agents
is doing the right thing.

496
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:09,802
That was Bellamy's work.

497
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:12,305
How could Rome be doing
the right thing?

498
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,607
Suppose he's got
a gun to his head.

499
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,258
Rome's cooperating.

500
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,060
Bellamy's forcing him
to do his dirty work.

501
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:19,395
Message originated

502
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:21,864
from an industrial area
in Pacoima.

503
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:22,982
Run kaleidoscope facial rec

504
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:24,266
and check security
cameras in the area

505
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:25,718
Got it.

506
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,309
I thought it was a
very simple request

507
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:34,460
to pull down your pants.

508
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:36,362
I do not like my trousers
to touch the bathroom floor.

509
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:38,731
I prefer to pull them
down to my knees.

510
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,616
Well, you could've done that,
shown some wrinkles.

511
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:42,385
Where do I have wrinkles?

512
00:19:42,387 --> 00:19:43,970
On your pant legs.
A lot more convincing

513
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,221
when she was checking
out your shoes.

514
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:47,306
Now she's super suspicious.

515
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:49,258
Can we just think
about the shredder?

516
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,560
Don't you worry
your pretty little head

517
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:51,677
'cause I have a plan.

518
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,112
Those words always scare me.
(clears throat)

519
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:55,431
Apple?

520
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:57,984
Yes, actually.

521
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,737
This is frozen.

522
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:04,907
Mm-hmm, and it's
from the dry ice.

523
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:06,976
See, regular ice
turns to water,

524
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:08,945
and gives you
a soggy sandwich.

525
00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:10,830
And what is worse
than a soggy sandwich?

526
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:12,031
(laughs)

527
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,617
(imitating Kensi):
Having to listen to you.

528
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,752
I didn't say it,
but I certainly thought it.

529
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:19,839
That anger management class
was money well spent.

530
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:25,194
Or not.

531
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:29,849
Get ready for a big bang.

532
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:32,101
KENSI:
You sure about this?

533
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,937
Positive.

534
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,171
It's taking way too long.

535
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:37,840
I think Mercury's
messing with you.

536
00:20:37,842 --> 00:20:40,443
Wait for it.

537
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:42,979
(yells)

538
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:45,164
Showtime.

539
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:47,149
(clears throat)

540
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:48,684
(fire alarm ringing)

541
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:51,537
What the hell was that?

542
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:52,872
Something blew up!

543
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:54,040
Everybody out. Let's go.

544
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:56,492
Come on.
Let's go!

545
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,804
DEEKS:
Incident reports.

546
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:16,145
Confidential
employee files.

547
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:21,851
You ready, Kens?

548
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:24,186
Ready.

549
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:29,075
(fire alarm bell ringing)

550
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:30,059
Incoming.

551
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:32,528
We need to leave
the building now.

552
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,779
Uh, not safe, definitely,
definitely not safe.

553
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:35,998
Matthew is prone
to panic attacks. (groans)

554
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,950
The fire department is on
the way. I think we're good.

555
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:39,618
Oh, it's not good,
it's definitely not good.

556
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,954
Oh, my lips are numb,
I can't feel my fingers...

557
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:43,089
and I think
I'm having chest pains.

558
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,406
Just breathe
into the bag.

559
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:46,842
Breathe into the bag!

560
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:48,094
I'm sorry for all the chaos.

561
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:50,680
Okay, let's go, come on.

562
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,215
Is it getting dark in here?

563
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:54,884
Oh, I feel like
it's getting dark in here.

564
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:56,218
Matthew...

565
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,853
I smell toast.
Do you smell toast?

566
00:21:57,855 --> 00:21:59,355
Why do I smell toast?
Am I having a stroke?

567
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:00,690
There's no toast.

568
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,695
Gil Bellamy
and Mitchell Rome,

569
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:08,764
arguing outside a futon
warehouse two hours ago.

570
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:11,150
Can't decide
on a king or a queen.

571
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:13,903
One block
from the burn phone text.

572
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:16,055
CALLEN:
Trouble in paradise.

573
00:22:16,057 --> 00:22:18,240
Looks like the partnership's
not working out so well.

574
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:20,776
They couldn't agree on a plan
or someone screwed up.

575
00:22:20,778 --> 00:22:22,745
Or Rome just found out
about the rebar

576
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:24,213
and bombing part of the plan.

577
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,715
(door opens)

578
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:27,633
Did you get anything
off the hard drive?

579
00:22:27,635 --> 00:22:29,952
They've expunged
all e-mails to and from Rome.

580
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:31,120
Even off the server.

581
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:32,304
What about the files?

582
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:33,589
Rendering now.

583
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,009
Well, there was a whole lot
of shredding going on.

584
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,293
It's a letter from Rome.

585
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:40,930
CALLEN: "As I have repeatedly
told my supervisors,

586
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:42,181
"I have serious concerns
about the transport

587
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:44,600
of hazardous materials
through HTUAs"?

588
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:47,186
"High Threat Urban Areas."

589
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:48,487
KENSI: "Materials including
chlorine gas

590
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:51,090
"anhydrous ammonia
and medical nuclear waste

591
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:52,441
"have been passing through
residential areas

592
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:55,411
in violation
of federal standards."

593
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:57,446
Why do that?
Why take the risk?

594
00:22:57,448 --> 00:23:00,499
Shortest path from point A
to point B is the cheapest.

595
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:01,534
Complying with indirect routes

596
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:03,485
could mean
millions in lost revenue.

597
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:05,121
So Rome was a whistle blower.

598
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:06,372
They wanted to shut him up.

599
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:08,124
They could have
rigged his crash.

600
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:09,925
Tampered with his drug test.

601
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:12,344
So Rome partnered
with Bellamy for revenge.

602
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:13,462
But Bellamy's taking it too far.

603
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:14,463
(phone ringing)

604
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:16,665
I got Jillian Rome
calling in.

605
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,500
Put her on speakerphone.
Yep.

606
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:21,336
Agent Hanna here.

607
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:23,172
Uh, hi, it's Jillian Rome.

608
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:25,224
You, uh, you told me to call.

609
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:26,508
Have you seen your son?

610
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,610
Not yet.

611
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:30,529
But, um, a friend of his
stopped by the house.

612
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:31,814
Somebody you know?

613
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,032
No.

614
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:34,516
What did he look like?

615
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:36,869
White guy, um, maybe 30.

616
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:38,821
Uh, he-he told me
that Mitch was okay.

617
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:42,792
And, um, he dropped off a box
of his stuff.

618
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:45,294
You think Bellamy
would harm the mom?

619
00:23:45,296 --> 00:23:46,996
How big is the box?

620
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:48,714
Like for files?

621
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:50,833
Should I open it?
No!

622
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:52,534
Get as far away as you can.

623
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:53,669
We're on our way.

624
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:55,004
Call the bomb squad,
evacuate the block.

625
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:57,873
And stay on that shredder--
we need a smoking gun.

626
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:04,096
(indistinct chatter)

627
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,661
You guys came a long way
for nothing.

628
00:24:18,663 --> 00:24:20,229
Looked like the real thing.

629
00:24:20,231 --> 00:24:22,031
Turns out it's nothing
but play putty.

630
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,916
It's orange like RDX.

631
00:24:23,918 --> 00:24:25,668
Wired to an alarm clock?

632
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,620
Like something Wile E. Coyote
used to build.

633
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:31,406
Someone's got
a sick sense of humor.

634
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:34,210
Who would do this?

635
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:35,845
And why?

636
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:39,348
You recognize this man?

637
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,350
He brought me the package.

638
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:47,756
Okay.

639
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:48,891
It's been verified.

640
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:50,643
Calling it in.

641
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:52,511
(phone ringing)

642
00:24:52,513 --> 00:24:53,896
Go ahead, Eric.

643
00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:55,397
Are you with Mrs. Rome?

644
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:56,949
We are.

645
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:58,901
You might want
to step away.

646
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:01,070
G.
Excuse me.

647
00:25:01,072 --> 00:25:03,105
Uh, okay.

648
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,108
SAM:
Go ahead, Eric.

649
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,293
A freight train's been hijacked

650
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:08,711
in Kern Junction.

651
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:10,579
It's Bakersfield to the north.

652
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:11,797
NELL:
An engine

653
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,666
and four tanks
of chlorine gas are heading

654
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:15,134
for Los Angeles right now.

655
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:17,086
Bellamy must've knew
we were onto him.

656
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:19,338
This fake bomb was
a diversion to keep us away.

657
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,223
If those chlorine tankers
explode or derail...

658
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:23,058
At least a 100,000 deaths.

659
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,061
NELL: I'm sending you a screen grab
from surveillance video.

660
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:27,980
You can make out the engineer.

661
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:32,101
Mitchell Rome.

662
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:34,303
Identity has been confirmed.

663
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:36,155
You still think he's a good kid?

664
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,930
Where are we?

665
00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:50,265
Approaching Mojave.

666
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:51,349
All traffic's been cleared.

667
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,684
Homeland's searching the tracks.

668
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,019
Any contact with Rome?

669
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:55,804
Not answering his radio or cell.

670
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,023
All right, what are our options?

671
00:25:58,025 --> 00:25:59,107
Sniper?

672
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:01,309
Could cause a crash.
How about a barrier?

673
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,644
A barrier's gonna
cause a derailment.

674
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:04,312
We'll have the release
of toxic fumes.

675
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,697
Do we need to evacuate the city?

676
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,032
If you want
mass casualties

677
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:08,933
due to panic.

678
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,268
We could drop in by helicopter.

679
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,236
We could put an engine in front,

680
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,287
match his speed, slow it down.

681
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:13,771
HETTY:
The clock is ticking.

682
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,074
He'll be here in
less than an hour.

683
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,659
I can get to Hobart yard,

684
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,044
head north on the high rail.

685
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:19,979
Go.

686
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,330
CALLEN: Eric, video conference
the boatshed.

687
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,998
Where e Kensi and Deeks?

688
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,966
Following up a facial
recognition hit on Bellamy.

689
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,505
MAN (over P.A.):
...is now boarding.

690
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,390
Please have your ticket in hand
for the driver.

691
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:33,558
Thank you.

692
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,894
DEEKS:
Gambler's special to Vegas.

693
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,647
A lot of bystanders.

694
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:39,981
That's Bellamy.

695
00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:41,232
Watch and learn.

696
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:42,684
Clean and surgical.

697
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:46,321
Cover my back.
Got it.

698
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:48,623
Anyone got change for a buck?

699
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,525
Anybody got change? You? Hey,
man, you got change for a buck?

700
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,794
I just need change for a dollar.
You got change for a dollar?

701
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:53,762
Uh, yeah, yeah.

702
00:26:53,764 --> 00:26:55,080
Some change for the meter.

703
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,033
Federal agent.
Don't move.

704
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:01,620
(grunting)

705
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,838
Hey!

706
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,206
This would be a lot easier

707
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,626
if you would've
just listened the first time.

708
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,177
No, no, ma'am,
that's okay, ma'am!

709
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,679
(Bellamy yelling)

710
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:12,013
Ma'am, that's okay...
You don't have to...

711
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:14,683
Wow, that seemed excessive.

712
00:27:14,685 --> 00:27:15,684
Thanks for looking out.

713
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:18,269
I think your new partner
has your back.

714
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:20,639
Punk ass!

715
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:25,026
Thank you for your...
for your help.

716
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,763
Have fun in Vegas!

717
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:36,738
$10,000 in cash and
a one-way bus ticket to Vegas.

718
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,373
So, what's your game,
huh-- poker?

719
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,524
Blackjack?

720
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:41,960
No, I take you as
more as a Keno guy.

721
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,044
I want a lawyer.

722
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:44,162
You gave up your right
to a lawyer

723
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,330
when you blew up
your motel room.

724
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,748
What are you talking about?

725
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,832
It's called the Patriot Act.

726
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,300
You almost killed
two federal agents.

727
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:51,536
I did express checkout
at 7:00 a.m. this morning.

728
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:53,388
Someone is setting me up.

729
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,924
Do you have witnesses? Video?

730
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,926
We have a video of you killing
a security guard

731
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,711
at a train yard.
You're crazy.

732
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:01,563
I've never been
near a train yard.

733
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:03,181
But your roommate has.

734
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,734
What were you two arguing
about at Pacoima?

735
00:28:05,736 --> 00:28:07,268
(scoffs)

736
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,404
The fool wants to raise my rent.

737
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:10,739
Rome is at the control
of a toxic train

738
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:12,857
heading
for downtown Los Angeles.

739
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,225
That doesn't surprise me.

740
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:16,327
He went crazy
after they fired him.

741
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:17,612
Uh-huh. What's his plan?

742
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:20,415
Why don't you ask him?

743
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:23,251
ERIC:
Callen, we got a fix on Rome.

744
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:25,170
His phone's with him,
but the power's been off.

745
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,788
Until...

746
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,339
now.

747
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:29,841
Enabling video chat.

748
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,301
Mitchell Rome.

749
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:43,855
My name is
Special Agent G. Callen.

750
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:44,939
I need you to stop the train.

751
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:46,224
Mitch, don't turn that off.

752
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,026
I've got nothing to say.

753
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:49,444
How about to your mom?

754
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:51,446
Look, I-I got, I got her
right here with me.

755
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,817
Mom?

756
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,319
Mitch?

757
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:01,456
Look, I... No one was supposed
to die last night.

758
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,107
That wasn't part of the plan.

759
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,876
I didn't mean
to do anything wrong.

760
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:08,296
Then stop the train, please.

761
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:10,615
No, no, I-I got fired
for telling the truth.

762
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:12,717
I'm trying
to protect the public.

763
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,968
Mitch, we know that
and we're gonna help you

764
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,136
get your message out, okay?

765
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:18,056
Now, just let's
not do anything stupid here.

766
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:19,674
I won't.

767
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,893
A lot of people could get hurt.

768
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:23,762
No, I'm helping a lot of people.

769
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,514
When I'm done here, they'll have
to re-route the hazmat runs.

770
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,933
Mitch, are you working
with Gil Bellamy?

771
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,019
No, this has nothing
to do with Bellamy.

772
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,238
Mitch, you've
made your point.

773
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,490
Let's not take a chance
with something going wrong here.

774
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:36,658
Nothing's going wrong.

775
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,560
I'm taking this train
to Union Station,

776
00:29:38,562 --> 00:29:39,994
and then I'll stop.

777
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:42,614
Everyone's got
to know the truth.

778
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:54,042
Sam's sweeping the tracks
with ATF.

779
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't see anything
out there but weeds.

780
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:06,104
It's a back branch line,
hardly ever used.

781
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:07,839
CALLEN: Sam, do you know
what you're looking for?

782
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:09,641
I will when I see it.

783
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,681
Just got word
from the occupational lab.

784
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:18,566
They thawed out
Rome's drug test.

785
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:19,984
DNA is not a match.

786
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,820
It's not his urine.
He was framed.

787
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:23,955
I told you, my son
doesn't do drugs.

788
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:25,323
ERIC:
More shredded documents

789
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,208
from Fillmore and Western.

790
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,128
Falsified manifests.

791
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,863
They were profiting
by sending

792
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:33,748
hazardous materials
into populated zones.

793
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,134
My son is telling
the truth.

794
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:37,719
Unlike his roommate.

795
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:40,004
DEEKS: Mitch Rome says you two
are working together.

796
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,023
Well, then he's a liar.
What did you tell him?

797
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:43,725
To stop being such a wuss.

798
00:30:43,727 --> 00:30:45,176
So you told him
to steal the train.

799
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:46,761
Maybe.
KENSI: Maybe?

800
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,180
See, he says all he wants
is for his message to be heard.

801
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,098
(scoffs)

802
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,649
Oh, it'll be heard, all right.

803
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:53,985
All the way to Long Beach.

804
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,773
Update from Sam in Valencia.

805
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,446
SAM: Camera's on, guys.
We've got the image.

806
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,750
(exhales)

807
00:31:08,752 --> 00:31:11,586
Okay, I've got an IED
on the tracks.

808
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:14,589
It has three parallel triggers,
including a pressure plate.

809
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:16,040
Can you render it safe?

810
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,175
Not at the trigger.

811
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:18,376
It's got a mercury switch,

812
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,628
a trembler--
any movement will set it off.

813
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,514
CALLEN: How big
of a charge we talking?

814
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:25,049
I couldn't tell you.

815
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,968
It's wireless.

816
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,470
Explosives are somewhere
under the tracks.

817
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,806
Mitch,
listen to me.

818
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,475
Bellamy has placed a bomb
on the tracks in Valencia.

819
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,611
Why would he do that?

820
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:39,063
Because he's a sociopath.
Now, listen to me.

821
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:42,317
Mitch, there's 250,000
people in that area.

822
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,768
If you don't stop this train,

823
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,237
you could wipe out
the entire Santa Clarita Valley.

824
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,824
You just want me to stop.

825
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,910
Mitch, I saw it for myself.

826
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:52,994
You got to trust us, Mitch.

827
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,295
You've made
your point, okay?

828
00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:58,049
Now, stop this
before it turns into a disaster.

829
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,420
Mitch, please.

830
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,726
I'm slowing down.

831
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:15,233
Eric, Sam,
he's stopping.

832
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,321
Um, it doesn't look like
he's stopping-- in fact,

833
00:32:20,323 --> 00:32:22,490
he's accelerating.

834
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:24,575
Mitch?
Mitch, talk to me.

835
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,194
You-you said
you were slowing down.

836
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,029
I'm trying.

837
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,665
I got no air pressure.
I don't have any brakes!

838
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,785
Bellamy sabotaged the lines.

839
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:38,039
I'm going 60 miles an hour.

840
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,290
I can't stop.

841
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,758
Oh, my God.

842
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,924
(horn blowing)

843
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,228
What about emergency brakes?
No such thing.

844
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,350
Well, maybe I can
uncouple the engine

845
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,985
and leave the tanks behind.

846
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,636
Give it a try.

847
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:24,335
(grunts)

848
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:30,507
(grunting)

849
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:34,962
(grunting)

850
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,499
(panting)

851
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,855
(grunting)

852
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,640
No, no, we're moving

853
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:48,776
too fast--
the coupler's jammed.

854
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:50,177
Uh...

855
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,364
m-maybe I can reverse the
polarity of the engine's motors.

856
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,815
The bomb is three miles ahead.

857
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:56,283
Uh, no, no, it's too dangerous.

858
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,285
There's no way
I'm gonna stop in time.

859
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,853
Do we have any other option?

860
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,038
Uh, I guess not.

861
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,491
(grunting)

862
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,966
(strained grunting)

863
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:16,253
I can't.
I'm braking from the head.

864
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,839
The tank cars are bunching up.
They're gonna derail.

865
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,062
Uh, I need at least
five miles here.

866
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:26,764
You don't have
five miles.

867
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:28,715
Okay, then get the bomb
off the track.

868
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:34,938
Damn it.

869
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,056
Nothing.

870
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:37,741
You should put on the suit.

871
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,909
What's the point?

872
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,244
If we survive the blast,

873
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,562
the toxic fumes
will still melt our lungs.

874
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,531
CALLEN:
Sam?

875
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:46,500
They turned over dirt
for 50 yards.

876
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,335
The initiator
could be buried anywhere.

877
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,703
How long is it
gonna take?

878
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:51,338
An hour to make a clean sweep;

879
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,739
five minutes if we're lucky.

880
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:53,707
Then get lucky.

881
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:54,908
ERIC:
Callen...

882
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,510
we found your smoking gun.

883
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,912
An authorization
for a $100,000

884
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:01,414
cash payment to private eye
Anthony Trager.

885
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,884
That's a lot of money to be
taking pictures of an apartment.

886
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:06,220
Trager resigned rather than
face corruption charges

887
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:07,754
in the 1998
Rampart scandal.

888
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:09,056
Those cops
were accused

889
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:10,891
of beating suspects,
planting evidence,

890
00:35:10,893 --> 00:35:13,110
and covering up
unprovoked shootings.

891
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,813
Mr. Callen,
if he's playing dirty,

892
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:18,031
then so must you.

893
00:35:20,235 --> 00:35:23,871
If you want answers,
turn on the news.

894
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,076
Tony Trager's in custody.
Who?

895
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:31,128
The dirty ex-cop that paid you
ten grand-- Fillmore and Western

896
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,214
paid him with marked bills,
which he passed on to you.

897
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,633
Yeah, I did some carpentry
and plumbing at his house.

898
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,617
Trager confessed.

899
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,303
His job was to make
Rome disappear.

900
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:41,839
Your job was to plant the
bombs at the apartment

901
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:42,973
and scout out the rail yard.

902
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,154
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

903
00:35:45,155 --> 00:35:46,454
They pay you to blow up
the motel, too?

904
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,313
And put the bombs on the tracks?

905
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:49,513
Are you asking me or telling me?

906
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,098
If you have all the
answers, why do you

907
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,516
need me?
This bomb goes off

908
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:54,101
you're looking at
the death penalty.

909
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:55,468
What bomb?

910
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,071
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

911
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,539
It sounds like
you don't, either.

912
00:35:58,541 --> 00:36:00,479
California doesn't have
the death penalty.

913
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:01,609
California?

914
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,862
No. We're talking about an
act of federal terrorism.

915
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:06,997
KENSI: We'll probably have to
put him in Guantanamo,

916
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,615
for his own safety.

917
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:09,917
Save it.

918
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,085
You're not scaring
a forced confession out of me.

919
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,671
(whispers):
Yeah, he's right.

920
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,206
Leave it to the
professionals.

921
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,159
Have the rendition team
get him out of here.

922
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,963
I hear those tube feedings
are delightful.

923
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:25,549
DEEKS: Just out of curiosity,
how do you say, uh,

924
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:29,186
"bottoms up" in Arabic?

925
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:33,640
It's 36 ties from the switch.

926
00:36:33,642 --> 00:36:35,359
...34, 35, 36.

927
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:38,178
(train horn blowing)

928
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:41,481
Less than a mile.

929
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,357
How's your speed?
I'm down to 30.

930
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:51,742
It's still too fast.

931
00:36:51,744 --> 00:36:54,077
You can bail, Mitch.

932
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,212
Jump out
while you can.

933
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:56,529
I can't let go of the throttle.

934
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:58,215
I have to try.

935
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,002
Mom?

936
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:07,040
(voice breaking):
I'm here.

937
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:09,476
I'm sorry.

938
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:16,883
There are people
on the track up ahead.

939
00:37:16,885 --> 00:37:18,551
I-Is that where the bomb is?

940
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,554
You've got about 30 seconds.

941
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,490
Nothing but dirt.

942
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,942
Bellamy's a liar!
Let's go!

943
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:28,528
Maybe he counted
the switch as number one.

944
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,499
MITCH: I can't stop in time.
Why aren't they moving?

945
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,917
You got an eye
on the train, Sam?

946
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,168
I see it.

947
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,921
Bingo!

948
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,540
Bricks of C-4 and a receiver.

949
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,711
Get them off the track!

950
00:37:44,713 --> 00:37:46,079
I'm not gonna make it.

951
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,514
Attacking the initiator.

952
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,935
Pray the power dump
doesn't set it off.

953
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,937
Don't be a fool!
Get out!

954
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:02,095
Sam?

955
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:23,083
♪

956
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:25,118
Piece of cake.

957
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,254
(pants)

958
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:29,923
(Jillian laughing)

959
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,649
(Jillian laughing)

960
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,936
(exhales)

961
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,244
Hey.

962
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:54,031
Well, hey,
how are you two doing?

963
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,916
Great. Just finishing
up some stuff.

964
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:56,833
Good.

965
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,151
Hey, you know
that guy, Rome?

966
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,252
Yeah.

967
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,488
Hijacked a train.
Yeah, I heard, huh?

968
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,839
What a loser.
Huh.

969
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,425
Well, I guess he won't be
suing the railroad now.

970
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:07,010
(chuckles):
Not a chance.

971
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,545
Oh, listen,
just out of curiosity,

972
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:11,131
what are you, uh,
what are you up to?

973
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,966
Eh, boring stuff.

974
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:15,469
Preemployment background
checks, that sort of thing.

975
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:17,437
Gotta pay the bills, huh?

976
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,340
Well, 90 grand pays
a lot of bills.

977
00:39:20,342 --> 00:39:24,027
What do you got in your,
uh, your murse there.

978
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,563
You got fifties... or hundreds?

979
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,348
KENSI: Yeah,
that's right.

980
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,650
Bellamy told us everything.

981
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:34,037
Yeah, well,
Bellamy's a lowlife scum.

982
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,572
Who you were
dumb enough to hire.

983
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,690
Oh, come on, really?

984
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:39,076
You're gonna shoot
federal agents?

985
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:40,961
You already murdered
a security guard.

986
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,246
DEEKS: Bellamy couldn't
make it, so you filled in.

987
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,697
KENSI: Where'd
you learn Arabic?

988
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:46,633
That "Allahu Akbar""
that was a nice touch.

989
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:47,584
Mm.
Very convincing.

990
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:48,835
Yeah.

991
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:53,140
Well... innocent
until proven guilty.

992
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,392
Gotta go.

993
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,546
Oh, thank you.

994
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:02,733
(guns cocking)

995
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:04,717
I will take that.

996
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,654
Sing along if you
know the words.

997
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:10,741
DEEKS & KENSI: You have the
right to remain silent.

998
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:13,226
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

999
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:14,995
in a court of law.

1000
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:20,417
40-weights all around.

1001
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,918
What is this?

1002
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,670
KENSI (sighs):
Oh, don't even ask.

1003
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:26,256
<i>Why does she need the reports tonight?
'Cause we got about</i>

1004
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,175
a hundred federal agencies
begging for the intel.

1005
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,843
DHS, FBI,

1006
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:33,263
NRC, DOJ, DOT, TSA...

1007
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,548
Okay, okay, okay.

1008
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,748
Where's Deeks?

1009
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,635
DEEKS: Oh! I think I just
broke a hoof. (groans)

1010
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:41,421
Transformer's
looking pretty good.

1011
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:42,422
Here you go.

1012
00:40:42,424 --> 00:40:43,590
Ah, thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

1013
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:45,142
Yeah, it was a gift
from Mitch Rome.

1014
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:47,277
He's gonna let me
babysit it for a few months

1015
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,595
until he gets out of prison.

1016
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:50,397
You may not want
to run this thing tonight.

1017
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:51,948
Yeah, probably not
for a couple weeks.

1018
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,451
At least not until
Mercury's out of retrograde.

1019
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:56,203
(laughs)

1020
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:57,904
You guys can laugh it up
all you want, but, uh,

1021
00:40:57,906 --> 00:41:00,574
did anyone's travel plans
go awry today?

1022
00:41:00,576 --> 00:41:02,826
Just like every day on the 405.

1023
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:04,277
Come on, you guys,
there were signs everywhere.

1024
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:05,445
Mitch Rome.

1025
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:07,614
Mercury's a Roman god.
The name

1026
00:41:07,616 --> 00:41:09,633
of the bus station.
What about it?

1027
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:12,335
Maximus Lines-- that's
the home temple of Mercury,

1028
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:13,587
the Circus Maximus.

1029
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:15,222
Oh...
SAM: Well, you know,

1030
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:16,789
in ancient Rome,
they spoke Latin.

1031
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:20,594
DEEKS: Mm.
And on the radio today, Latin music.

1032
00:41:20,596 --> 00:41:21,728
He's right.

1033
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,964
Okay, you two are
pretty cute together.

1034
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:26,900
But the fact is that you
couldn't disarm the bomb

1035
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,235
because it had a
mercury trigger.

1036
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:29,736
I'm just, I'm thinking
that's interesting.

1037
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:30,854
CALLEN:
Uh-huh.

1038
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,305
You going to chisel your report

1039
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:34,074
in stone, Mr. Deeks?

1040
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:37,477
Yeah, I was just... putting
the last final touches on it.

1041
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:39,646
Oh...

1042
00:41:39,648 --> 00:41:40,947
This?

1043
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:42,815
HETTY:
That...

1044
00:41:42,817 --> 00:41:45,118
is an Airfix Prairie Tank.

1045
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,205
DEEKS: Yeah.
HETTY: Oh! That's a classic!

1046
00:41:48,207 --> 00:41:50,841
It is, indeed.
Does it work?

1047
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,459
Oh, yeah, this is
gonna be great.

1048
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:54,094
I mean, Christmas is
coming early this year.

1049
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,328
I've been dreaming
about this, Hetty,

1050
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,764
since I was, like, five years old.
(whoops)

1051
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,282
(Hetty laughs)
(whistle blows)

1052
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:02,168
DEEKS: Hetty, see, I-I haven't
fully secured the tracks!

1053
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:05,055
Make it stop, Hetty! No! Aah!

1054
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,876
<i>SAM: Mercury's a bitch, ain't it?
(all laugh, Deeks groans)</i>
