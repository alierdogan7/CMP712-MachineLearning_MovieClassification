1
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,140
ONCE UPON A TIME IN ANATOLIA

2
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,711
Izzet, bring him over.

3
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,440
Is it here?

4
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,320
Huh?

5
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,358
-No.
-What?

6
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,596
-It's not here.
-You sure?

7
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,916
How do you know it's not here?

8
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,470
-The place wasn't like this.
-What?

9
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,631
The place wasn't like this.
There was a field.

10
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,439
What sort of field?
On a slope or fiat?

11
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,832
Flat. There was like a round tree.

12
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,752
A round tree?

13
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,637
Chief, does he mean
the fountain down beside Kizilkaya?

14
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,472
Oh, the one by whatsitsname..

15
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,314
-There's a field there?
-Sure.

16
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,479
-So you're saying it's not here.
-No.

17
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,109
OK. Take him away, Izzet.

18
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,630
Mr Prosecutor, seems there's
another fountain like this down below.

19
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,598
He says it's not here,
so I'd guess it's there.

20
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,194
-So it's not here either.
-No. That's what he says.

21
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,837
Fine. Let's go then.

22
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,552
-We call it 'komus' where I come from.
-Whatever. So one night...

23
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,870
It's late. Everyone's tanked up.

24
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,554
-You listening, doctor?
-Of course, chief.

25
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,228
So we're all drunk
and the tax officer walks off.

26
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,233
I think, he's an ass-licker.
He'll come back with something.

27
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,470
Soon as he sees a big wig,
he gets to work.

28
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,358
-That's Nedim.
-Who?

29
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,193
-The tax officer at the time.
-No, it was Sinasi.

30
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,713
Nedim came before him.

31
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,476
Oh, yes. He'd throw back
his head to talk. Fat and bald.

32
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,758
Around two months
after Mr. Galip arrived...

33
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,070
...he got posted somewhere else.

34
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,949
Well, he goes off with the waiters.

35
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,192
And they come back with three trays.

36
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,234
-See a tray and what do you think?
-Kebabs.

37
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,913
You'd think kebabs. Meat.

38
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,758
But no! It's yoghurt.
What kind of yoghurt?

39
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,668
Not the soupy kind we know.
It's hard as rock.

40
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,595
-You need a knife to cut the stuff.
-Sure it wasn't cheese, chief?

41
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,960
Cheese?

42
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,270
You think I don't know yoghurt
from cheese, doctor?

43
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,078
What do you take me for?

44
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,470
That stuff's delicious, doctor.
Especially in spring.

45
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,031
No, it was yoghurt.
But buffalo yoghurt.

46
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,236
Not sheep or whatever,
buffalo yoghurt.

47
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,790
They have buffalo stuff at the dairy
down from our quarters.

48
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,270
-Where is there a dairy?
-Down from our quarters, sir.

49
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,079
Which quarters are you in?
What dairy?

50
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,550
You know that dairy
below our quarters?

51
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,153
-By Kivircik's place?
-Yes, sir.

52
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,072
They sometimes make it there.

53
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,312
-That stuff's pasteurized!
-No, it's buffalo. I've tried it.

54
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,391
-It kind of smelled.
-It smells if it's good.

55
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,112
Buffalo yoghurt.. Wouldn't I know
if they had it at the corner shop?

56
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,799
-I'm crazy about the stuff.
-To be honest, chief, you don't know.

57
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,793
I tried it.
But it just seemed to smell a bit.

58
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,750
Because it's good. The animals eat
fresh grass in spring, right, doctor?

59
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,877
Arab, some people have no taste
for the good things.

60
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,157
I mention buffalo yoghurt
and the guy says it smells.

61
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,232
He doesn't know the real thing.
What's he used to?

62
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,834
Pasteurized. You can get
pasteurized from any shop.

63
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,434
No, chief. My deceased mother
used to make it.

64
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,033
They can't make it like that now.

65
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,636
You know, I see stuff sometimes
that really bugs me.

66
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,872
In the supermarket. 'Skimmed' yoghurt.
What the hell is that?

67
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,713
'Skimmed' yoghurt.
You'd be ashamed to write the words.

68
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,314
There's a good dollop
of cream in buffalo yoghurt.

69
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,278
Nedim was in Mr. Galip's time.
That's the guy.

70
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,351
-He was a good man.
-And nice.

71
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,990
Nice, meaning harmless.
Harmless passes for nice these days.

72
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,799
Useful doesn't come into it, Arab.

73
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,758
OK, where is it then?

74
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,160
Well..

75
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,200
Huh?

76
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,432
Well, umm...

77
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,073
Kenan!

78
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,950
-Speak to me! Where is it?
-I don't know.

79
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,118
-I mean, I'd been drinking.
-What?

80
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,555
-I'd been drinking.
-Huh?

81
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,516
You'd been drinking.

82
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,072
-You'd been drinking?
-Yes.

83
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,516
-Had your brother been drinking too?
-He doesn't drink.

84
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,749
So you don't remember exactly?

85
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,351
Say something.
Say there was a tree, anything!

86
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,796
Was it up by the fountain
or below the road? Say something!

87
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,040
Ramazan.

88
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,799
Come over here, lad.

89
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,675
Can you show me, lad?
Where it was then?

90
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,190
Huh? Where was it?

91
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,788
Ramazan, don't be scared now.
Just say where it was.

92
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,079
I don't know.

93
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,672
You don't know?

94
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,197
You don't know
or you don't remember?

95
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,875
-I was asleep.
-What do you mean?

96
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,868
Answer me, lad!

97
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,548
-I was asleep.
-Huh?

98
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,073
I was asleep.

99
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,312
You were asleep.

100
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,038
Kenan.

101
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,950
Just get your head together
and let's be done with this, huh?

102
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,352
Is this the place?

103
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,475
-I think so.
-You think so?

104
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,149
Over by that fountain, if we...

105
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,717
-Over here?
-Yes.

106
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,913
Your tree.. The trees are down below.
Or was the tree by the fountain?

107
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,992
It's dark now.
I need to look.

108
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,438
Sergeant, point those headlights
this way.

109
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,636
Mehmet, turn the car round
to face the fountain.

110
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,756
Izzet, bring him over.

111
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,318
Is this the place?

112
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,991
Well...

113
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
Yes?

114
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,550
It looks like here, but those trees...

115
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,311
-Which trees?
-On a diagonal with those trees...

116
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,035
-Yes?
-There was a dug-up field.

117
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,870
-You mean ploughed?
-Yes.

118
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,633
Come here. Look, this is ploughed.
You mean here?

119
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,759
Huh?

120
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,636
Diggers! Over here!

121
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,628
Check for any newly dug holes.

122
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,399
Quick!

123
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,031
Where exactly in the field?

124
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,999
Right by the entrance, or what?

125
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,828
-Huh?
-There was a round tree.

126
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,473
What kind of tree?

127
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,638
I say that
because it was easy to dig.

128
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,713
You say there was a round tree.
What do you mean?

129
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,871
Did you dig under the tree?

130
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,633
Kenan, now look here.

131
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,160
Are you trying to distract me?

132
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,630
It won't get you anywhere.

133
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,236
Whatever we talked about
at the police station, that's it.

134
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,553
You come out here
and you lose your head.

135
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,399
I'm treating you decently.
So be a man and show me the place.

136
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,200
Huh?

137
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,912
Where is it?

138
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,674
Is it here?
Hey, is it here?

139
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,075
Mr Prosecutor, he says
this isn't the place either.

140
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,038
Naci. Didn't you say to me
everything was all set?

141
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,309
Yes, Mr Prosecutor, but... They'd been
drinking that night. And the darkness...

142
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,473
I have to be in Ankara in the morning.
You know that. I told you.

143
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,269
I know, but everywhere looks
kind of the same to be honest.

144
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,310
Look, we all came out here
counting on you.

145
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,239
Arab, the guys got left behind.
Can't you see? Give them a shout.

146
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,438
Hey, Hayrettin!

147
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,191
Shape up! Move it!

148
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,390
Quick! Move it!

149
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,308
It's easy to just sit there
and talk.

150
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,956
Right, Arab?

151
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,348
What's that, boss?

152
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,796
I'm saying it's easy
to sit there and spout.

153
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,950
Look, did I give you any guarantees?

154
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,635
Did I? Am I an insurance company?

155
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,716
I take the suspects' statements.
The guys confess.

156
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,634
They say they'll show us the place.
So I say let's wrap up the case.

157
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,472
What else can I say?

158
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,833
The place has to be Girmacakil, boss.
Can't be anywhere else.

159
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,076
Because he's talking about
an old bridge.

160
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,028
Easier said than done, of course.
You attend the questioning then!

161
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,439
First you dump the job on me,
then you give me a hard time about it!

162
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,036
Give me a break, Arab! How many times
have I told you I gave up?

163
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,432
You're stressed out, right, boss?
Just thought you'd loosen up a bit.

164
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,554
Ah, hello? Hello.

165
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,353
It's dragging on, you know.
That's why I haven't called.

166
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,830
You should go to bed.
Tonight's going to be a bit..

167
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,958
I'm saying go to bed. Go to bed.
Sweetie, this. It won't end soon.

168
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,560
Where am I? On the road. In the car
with Arab Ali. We're out looking.

169
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,989
We're heading towards Girmacakil.

170
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,039
Not Diyarbakir, Girmacakil.

171
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,039
Hello?

172
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,190
How am I supposed to call?
Look, there's no signal.

173
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,078
Oh, that.
I was going to yesterday but..

174
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,677
OK, the doctor's here with me now.
I'll take care of it.

175
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,956
I didn't forget.

176
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,557
I didn't forget, dearest. Would I?
What way is that to talk?

177
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,594
OK, first thing tomorrow I'll..

178
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,277
OK, I'll take care of it.

179
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,080
I didn't forget
for goodness sake. OK.

180
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,313
How's the boy?
Hello?

181
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,752
Hey, doctor.
My boy's out of pills. I..

182
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,996
I meant to stop by yesterday
for a prescription, but forgot again.

183
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,874
The wife keeps asking, of course.

184
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,233
-Can we sort it out in the morning?
-Sure, no problem.

185
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,715
Thanks. Let me get the thing
or it won't be...

186
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,191
What's going on now?
Why's he stopped?

187
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,965
What's up?

188
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,437
I always get lost on this road.
Why don't you go first, chief?

189
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,591
You know none of the roads and still
you get to drive for the courthouse!

190
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,430
What's holding them up?

191
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,031
How many times is that now?
Three or four?

192
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,073
I've been counting, sir.
It's five including this time.

193
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,829
Doctor, that's prostate, right?
The prosecutor's thing?

194
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,631
It depends. Maybe, maybe not.

195
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,869
Five times and it still depends?

196
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,872
Well, without an examination..

197
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,511
I get up once a night.
Twice if I've drunk a lot of water.

198
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,672
That's normal, isn't it?

199
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,310
Right, once a night is fine.
Quite normal.

200
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,356
But after a certain age
it's worth getting checked.

201
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,150
You're coming in the morning, right?
I can examine you then.

202
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,709
No, God forbid!

203
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,476
-Why?
-I know how it's done.

204
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,199
Oh, right.

205
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,517
There's nothing wrong with me.

206
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,833
But check the prosecutor, I'd say.

207
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,233
He's coming.

208
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,631
Is it above the road or below?
Let's hear that first.

209
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,748
Huh?

210
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,198
You came this way.

211
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,433
-Down there..
-You're saying it's down there?

212
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,157
What about the tree?
Where's the round tree?

213
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,353
The tree there, you can see the top.
Can we look there?

214
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
-That tree down there?
-Yes.

215
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,752
Headlights, sergeant!
Headlights down below!

216
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,434
Mehmet, point the lights down below.

217
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,194
-Diggers, over here!
-Mr. Naci!

218
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,837
-Shall we bring Suspect Two this time?
-No, not necessary.

219
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,151
-What's your name?
-Hayrettin, chief.

220
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,520
-Fahrettin?
-Hayrettin, chief.

221
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,752
Why did you both bring shovels?
Huh? Fahrettin?

222
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,959
Hayrettin, chief.

223
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,679
I'm asking you something
and you correct me, son of a bitch.

224
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,515
If you can't dig up the ground here,
I'll use you as a pickaxe.

225
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,148
Got that, Fahrettin?

226
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,477
Captain, switch to full-beam!
Is that full-beam?

227
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,473
-Come down a bit.
-Is that full-beam?

228
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,111
Switch to full-beam!
Point them at the trees!

229
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,191
What's going on?
Where are they?

230
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,716
-Down there, looking around.
-Is this the place?

231
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,513
No idea, doctor.

232
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,599
First the guy talks about fields,
now he says it's the hillside.

233
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
I don't get it.

234
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,833
Hey, Arab.

235
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,948
There's a bunch of sculptures
over there.

236
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,793
Sculptures?

237
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,470
Oh right, yes.
There's a lot around here.

238
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,398
They're paying you overtime,
right, doctor?

239
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,437
I don't know. I expect so.

240
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,030
They will.

241
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,597
They should.

242
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,474
The money's good
when it's a corpse.

243
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,152
Look at Tevfik.
He never misses a chance.

244
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,155
All that overtime and suddenly
there's a second storey on his house.

245
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,394
It's raining like crazy
over in Igdebeli, doctor.

246
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,154
It'll be here before you know it.

247
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,756
I come here a lot, doctor.

248
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,799
You see, I love it here.
I jump in the car.

249
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:55,271
I fill up my pockets with bullets,
40 or 50, come here and fire away.

250
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,717
If there's no game around,
then straight into the air.

251
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,793
How can I say?

252
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,913
It's a way of letting off steam.

253
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,598
So you have a gun, huh?

254
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,674
Who doesn't round here, doctor?

255
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,595
You can't do without a gun.

256
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,037
There's good people and bad.
You can never tell.

257
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,316
If it comes to it,
you have to be ruthless.

258
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,034
And shoot them
right between the eyes.

259
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,635
That's how it is
around here, doctor.

260
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,834
You're kind of forced to
take matters into your own hands.

261
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,438
If you can't manage yourself,
they'll handle it just like that.

262
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,720
You won't know how it happened.

263
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,716
That's how it is. Behind the wheel,
by the window, and for free as well.

264
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,433
They won't fall for it.

265
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,796
They won't be fooled.

266
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,353
They're tricky crooks. What's worse,
they make out you owe them.

267
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,312
I know, I'm telling you.

268
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,912
You have to stay in the circle,
and keep an eye on the center.

269
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,517
How about the hoop?
Would that do? Sure, that's OK too.

270
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,753
But in the right place
at the right time.

271
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,757
The thing is.. If it comes to it,
you also have to be able to give up.

272
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,631
We none of us live forever,
do we, doctor?

273
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,514
The Prophet Solomon.
He lived to 750.

274
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,912
Gold, jewels..
Well, he died in the end too.

275
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,191
Right, doctor?

276
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,233
It's raining on Igdebeli.

277
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,231
Let it.

278
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,354
It's been raining for centuries.
What difference does it make?

279
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,831
But not even 100 years from now, Arab...

280
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,958
...neither you, me,
the prosecutor or the police chief..

281
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,915
Well, as the poet said...

282
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,315
Still the years will pass..

283
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,757
And not a trace will remain of me..

284
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,580
Darkness and cold
will enfold my weary soul..

285
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,836
Isn't that so, Arab?

286
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,077
Hey, steady on, doctor!

287
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,472
We're not done yet! And you've
buried us before we're even dead.

288
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,357
You shouldn't think like that.

289
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,750
I don't know. It's dragging on.

290
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,753
-It's the boredom getting to me.
-No.

291
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,317
Don't, you know..
Maybe you're bored to death now.

292
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,999
But one day, you may get a kick
out of the stuff going on here.

293
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,595
When you have a family...

294
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,073
...you'll have a story to tell.
Is that so bad?

295
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,553
You can say,
'Once upon a time in Anatolia... '

296
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,235
'... when I was working
out in the sticks... '

297
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,073
'... I remember this one night
which began like this. '

298
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,431
You can tell it like a fairytale.

299
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,675
-Isn't that right, doctor?
-Yes. Sure.

300
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,754
C'mon, Arab!
Get ready to move on.

301
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,318
OK, Mr Prosecutor.
We're all sorted.

302
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,348
The place is definite now.
Not here, but at the next bend.

303
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,835
Soon as we get there...

304
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,351
We're done, guys.
Everyone in the cars. At the double!

305
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,870
-Lead the way, Mr Prosecutor.
-Let's go.

306
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,918
-Get in! Leg out of the way!
-C'mon, Arab!

307
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,075
Sergeant, I'll give you a shout
if we need Suspect Two. OK?

308
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,559
Right, OK.

309
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,551
Back out! Out!

310
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,311
I do a cross-examination
and look what the guy says!

311
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,469
'Shall I bring you Suspect Two?'
He's carving a role for himself there.

312
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,558
-Arab, are you in love or something?
-No, boss. But..

313
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,037
The car won't move.
It won't move.

314
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,031
Shall I tell you something?
Look, that junior officer...

315
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,754
Arab, put your foot down.

316
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,715
-Arab, you're sticking it in third!
-What shall we do? Push?

317
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,520
C'mon, out.

318
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,631
Shall we push, Mr. Naci?

319
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,075
-Leave it to us.
-Izzet. Don't stand there. Push!

320
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,231
-Chief, he's in third gear.
-Bravo!

321
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,958
-You start in second, idiot!
-I'm here.

322
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,872
Captain.. Over here.

323
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,195
God! C'mon, speed up!

324
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,513
Hold it!

325
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,232
-OK, move!
-Hey, boss..

326
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:35,032
You never get good LPG on the way out
of Kirikkale. Never! I have my place.

327
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,880
I don't want to say this,
you know, but..

328
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,352
It's always Tevfik. Rely on him
for anything and sure enough..

329
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,988
What model's this car?

330
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,829
Arab, we're on the right road,
right?

331
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,353
Inshallah, boss. As the song goes,
we're riding on a sign bound for hell.

332
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,079
We do whatever sir in the back says.
And he asks me what's going on.

333
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,109
For God's sake. How do I know?

334
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,195
But well, if the old bridge
can't be anywhere except Girmacakil.

335
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,560
Huh?

336
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,874
-Actually, on the way to the dam...
-Look, don't give me dams now!

337
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,952
-The dam's miles away!
-There's an old bridge there too.

338
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,839
But obviously, boss,
that's in the wrong direction.

339
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,674
Hey! Did you see
anything like a dam?

340
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,158
Is he asleep? Wake him up!

341
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,313
-Wake up, you!
-Didn't I tell you to keep him awake?

342
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,191
-I didn't realize.
-You never goddamn listen!

343
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,388
Was there a dam?
You see anything like it on the way?

344
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,878
-Was there a dam?
-No.

345
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,635
-You sure?
-Yes.

346
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,434
Yes?

347
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,236
-It could be across there.
-What?

348
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,639
Across there.

349
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,756
-You mean the slope across there.
-Yes.

350
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,831
OK. Sergeant!

351
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,752
Turn the car around.

352
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,993
And beam the lights
straight at that facing slope.

353
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,628
Mehmet, over here. Follow me.

354
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,998
Yes. Beam those lights.
Turn around.

355
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,471
OK, that's good.

356
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,554
Watch out for the water.
Go ahead.

357
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,549
God! Diggers, where are you?

358
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,953
Don't wait for an invitation
every time. Run automatically!

359
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,118
That's my socks gone, Izzet.

360
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,032
What do you say, Mr Prosecutor?
Looks like we finally cracked it, huh?

361
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,356
Don't be so sure, doctor.

362
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,876
Well, Naci seems
pretty confident this time.

363
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,876
Ignore Naci.

364
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,438
He's just a handful of bees,
as my mother would say.

365
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,356
All noise and no action.

366
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,193
Was it Fahrettin, your name?
What?

367
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,548
You don't have kids,
do you, doctor?

368
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,479
No.

369
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,399
-I'm not even married, Mr Prosecutor.
-I know that but..

370
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,460
Actually, I was married,
but I divorced two years ago.

371
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,278
Good thing then.

372
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,954
-What?
-I said good thing then.

373
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,917
I mean, there being no kids.

374
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,277
-Divorce isn't easy if there's kids.
-Right.

375
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,915
I didn't want kids.

376
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,078
Basically, doctor,
you've done the best thing.

377
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,075
Look at the times we live in.

378
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,672
Here you go.
And this is nothing.

379
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,116
How many more examples, only worse!

380
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,317
With some of the deaths
I come across in this job...

381
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,112
...you need to be less a prosecutor
than an astrologer to find the cause.

382
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,958
Whichever way you look,
you just can't make sense of it.

383
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,470
There was a woman, for example.

384
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,828
The wife of a friend.

385
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,540
One day, the woman said she'd die
on a specific date five months later.

386
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,518
And sure enough,
when that day came around...

387
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,276
...the woman dropped dead.

388
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,239
-What do you mean?
-Exactly what I said.

389
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,433
She said she'd have her baby
and die five months later.

390
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,477
And a few days after giving birth...

391
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,438
...she dropped dead...

392
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,038
...for no reason at all.

393
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,556
-So the woman was pregnant?
-Yes.

394
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,795
And she was a smart, educated woman,
not in the least superstitious.

395
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,352
Oh, and she was just gorgeous too.

396
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,879
Mr Prosecutor..

397
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:28,020
-Would you like some cream biscuits?
-Yes, sergeant. I'm starving. Thanks.

398
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,911
-Dr Cemal?
-No, thanks.

399
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,390
I see you've come prepared, sergeant.

400
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,591
That's what marks out a soldier.

401
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,673
Luckily I had some spare fuel
put in the back too. Two cans, sir.

402
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,599
Good thinking.

403
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,951
Because at this rate...

404
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,511
who knows how far we'll be going.

405
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,750
Right now we're 34 km
from the town centre, sir.

406
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,919
Really?

407
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,912
-We've come that far?
-I'd even say 35 km.

408
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,636
We've been outside
the municipal limits for a while.

409
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,472
Right.

410
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,439
This business is dragging on.

411
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,195
Will there be a problem
with the report, sir?

412
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,079
What?

413
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,197
Will Naci get us to sign
the report, or sign himself?

414
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,999
-We don't want a problem there.
-With the investigation report?

415
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,197
Yes. Beyond the municipal limits
is gendarmerie territory.

416
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,875
-We don't want a problem there.
-No, sergeant.

417
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,713
-The crime took place in town.
-Yes.

418
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,155
If it hadn't, you'd be right.
That's not the case.

419
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,357
For that reason, Mr. Naci is still
in charge. There isn't a problem.

420
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,832
OK. Obviously we take orders from you.

421
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,675
Can I have another one?

422
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,436
-Dr Cemal, like one?
-No, thanks.

423
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,312
The butcher thinks about meat,
the lamb about the knife.

424
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,393
The man's only worry
is the municipal boundaries.

425
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,952
Look at him! He's even bothered
to count the kilometers.

426
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,598
So what was the cause
of that woman's death?

427
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,669
The gorgeous woman
you were talking about.

428
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,879
What was her cause of death?
What did the doctors say?

429
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,868
You little fucker! Son of a bitch!

430
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,554
You fucking dickhead!
Are you taking the piss?

431
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,154
-Am I your plaything?
-Mr. Naci! What's going on?

432
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,675
-Chief!
-Get away! Asshole!

433
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,911
-Naci!
-Fuck you!

434
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,199
Naci!

435
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,159
You understand this language, right?
Dickhead!

436
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,675
Come here!
Show me that round tree!

437
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,878
Show me a round tree,
or your whole family's fucked!

438
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,157
Naci! What the hell is going on?

439
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,390
-Here! Show the prosecutor that tree...
-Hold it! Just calm down!

440
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,393
Here, Mr Prosecutor. Out of my way!

441
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,354
He's going to show us
a round tree.

442
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,069
Get off him, OK?
Izzet! Take him away.

443
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,036
-What is this, acting like a kid?
-This business ends tonight, asshole!

444
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,395
Now look here, Naci!

445
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,191
Just calm down!

446
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,195
What's this ruckus about?
You can't go about things like this!

447
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,917
For God's sake. Now look here,
just come with me.

448
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,915
-This business ends tonight, fucking...
-Naci!

449
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,233
What is this? No rough stuff!

450
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,950
-You'll have us both in trouble.
-It's the language he understands.

451
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,873
No, out of the question!

452
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,033
You'll have us both in trouble.
If he was left to you, then what?

453
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,352
But Mr Prosecutor, the guy said
during questioning...

454
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,149
...that we'd come out here,
he'd show us, and we'd be done.

455
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,357
-I don't want to disappoint you.
-You questioned him.

456
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,870
I dropped everything in Ankara
and came back for your sake.

457
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,799
We've been wandering about for hours.
My patience is running out.

458
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,475
My whole thing is to get you
to Ankara as fast as possible.

459
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,196
-That's gone pear-shaped too.
-He only understands that language!

460
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,519
-Shameless git!
-First, just calm down, OK?

461
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,798
Just calm down.
We have a bit more time.

462
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,675
Let's finish the job and I'll be off.
We won't get anywhere like this.

463
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,708
It's my responsibility
that you're out here. I...

464
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,438
You know
the new code of procedures?

465
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,989
It's the new code that made this mess.

466
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,673
Look, Naci. I like you..

467
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,434
I wouldn't want to lead
an inquiry into your conduct.

468
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,831
Is this how we'll get into
the European Union? No way!

469
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,588
-Even in the EU, dickheads like...
-I know everyone's tired.

470
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,594
Give me another half-hour
and if I don't nail the asshole...

471
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,275
Naci! Everyone's tired, I know.

472
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,029
But you should have cleared this up
during questioning.

473
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,670
Now is not the time.
We've been on the road for hours.

474
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,993
What do we do now? Give up?

475
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,518
No, Mr Prosecutor. Why give up?
I'll get this done tonight.

476
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,198
Another half-hour with him and I'll..
Don't get me wrong, I won't..

477
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,672
You know what we'll do then?

478
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,474
The team's tired as it is.
We'll grab something to eat.

479
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,900
We'll have a break and calm down.
OK? And carry on after that.

480
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,111
OK, guys. There's no problem.

481
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,475
Izzet, wipe his mouth.

482
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,909
Let's not get demoralized.

483
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,432
We'll have a break now.
Then carry on.

484
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,999
-Tevfik!
-Yes, Mr Prosecutor?

485
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,628
Remember you said
there was a village near here?

486
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,075
-You mean Ceceli, sir?
-At the mayor's place.

487
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,800
-Ceceli, sir. Arab's wife's village.
-Really?

488
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,279
-Ceceli.
-We're going to Ceceli then.

489
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,439
-Mr Prosecutor?
-Yes?

490
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,716
There's Koshger. It's closer,
cleaner, more, you know..

491
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,189
We should go there.

492
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,315
But Koshger's at least 7-8 km away.
Ceceli's only 5-6 km.

493
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,631
Mr Prosecutor,
the Ceceli road's a bit risky.

494
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,509
-What's risky about it?
-Floods have wrecked the road.

495
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,429
-I tried going last week in a tractor.
-I went with the agriculturists.

496
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,160
It was no problem.
The road was fine.

497
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,198
-Did you go the Harmanli way?
-Yes.

498
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,590
They must have fixed that bit.

499
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,799
-I'm talking about whatsit..
-Masat.

500
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,599
-Yes.
-Well, where are we going? To Ceceli.

501
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,354
Does it matter which way we go?
Aren't we going to Ceceli?

502
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,597
You mentioned Harmanli!
Otherwise, go whatever way.

503
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,318
The outcome?

504
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,792
In that case, let's...

505
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,513
We're going to Ceceli.

506
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,034
-Tevfik?
-Yes, Mr Prosecutor?

507
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,192
Call the mayor.
Tell him the prosecutor's coming.

508
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,111
-Have him make tea and whatever.
-Right away, Mr Prosecutor!

509
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,472
Bring him over.

510
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,551
Let me have a look.

511
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,478
Got a cigarette?

512
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,359
Did you say something?

513
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,035
Can I have a cigarette
if you've got one?

514
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,805
Sure.

515
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,070
Arab, give me a cigarette, will you?

516
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,113
-What's up, doctor?
-You light it.

517
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,111
-Thanks.
-Hang on, doctor! Don't give it to him.

518
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,232
What do you want
with that cigarette? Huh?

519
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,155
What do you want
with that cigarette?

520
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,910
I'm talking to you!
What do you want with it?

521
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,470
He wants a smoke. What else?

522
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,519
No, wait. You tell me, you!
What do you want with that cigarette?

523
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,879
Look, if you want a cigarette,
first you have to earn it.

524
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,714
Nothing comes for free anymore.

525
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,879
Look at the prosecutor.

526
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,873
The guy studied law, he's worked.

527
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,391
He can smoke
and he can give people hell.

528
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,358
Why? Because he's earned it.

529
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,839
What have you done?
Made idiots of us.

530
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,998
No, none of that.

531
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,356
No more free cigarettes.

532
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,354
We're tuned to another channel now.

533
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,438
Doctor, you don't know these guys.

534
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,513
They're such bastards
they'd rob you blind, the assholes.

535
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,477
He's seen you're a pigeon.
He's plotting now as we speak.

536
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,798
It's over.

537
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,279
From now on, I'm talking
a different language to you.

538
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,712
Thanks.

539
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,151
Are they here? Esat!

540
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,188
Haci, come here.

541
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,836
Open the gates, quick!

542
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,911
Mukhtar my friend, the prosecutor.

543
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,677
-Hello, mukhtar.
-Welcome. Thanks for coming.

544
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,037
-How are you, mukhtar?
-Welcome, chief. Welcome.

545
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,753
Doctor, welcome.

546
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,157
Welcome, sergeant. Bless you.
Come on in!

547
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,392
It's so good of you to come.
Bless you. Really.

548
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,876
-Are the dogs tied up?
-They won't bite or anything.

549
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,393
Esat, hold him.

550
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,790
Come on.
He won't do anything.

551
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,992
-This way. Are you tired?
-Very.

552
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,754
-What's up at this time of night?
-An investigation.

553
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,558
-Really?
-Into an incident.

554
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,954
-Sorry, our visit is hardly timely.
-Not at all! It's an honour!

555
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,519
Yalcin, don't hang around there!
In you go now!

556
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,519
Mr. Naci, doctor, in you go.

557
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,231
For heaven's sake, c'mon, sergeant.
In you go.

558
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,075
So, it takes a death to get you
to our village, Mr Prosecutor?

559
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,954
True, the doctor came the other day
to vaccinate the babies, bless him.

560
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,031
But his thing's different.

561
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,229
Well, we'd come, mukhtar,
but we had to twist Arab's arm.

562
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,800
Why?

563
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,277
How do I know? He went on about
all the donkey people in the village.

564
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,753
-Whatever that means.
-You believe that nutcase, chief?

565
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,312
Ignore the nutcase. He never
stops talking, to himself as well.

566
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,194
If we start on him,
I could talk for hours.

567
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,079
His grandfather's nickname
was Cafer the Donkey Man.

568
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,629
-Really?
-Of course.

569
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,077
-Cafer what?
-Cafer the Donkey Man.

570
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,480
Arab, is that true?

571
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,594
Boss, my grandfather traded donkeys.
What else would his nickname be?

572
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,711
The guys here are another kind
of donkey men.

573
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,509
Ignore what he says, chief.
Arab's a decent fellow actually.

574
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,393
One of the family. We like him.
We gave him a bride from the village.

575
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,877
-Really?
-Yes. He's family.

576
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,994
What way is that to talk about
people from your wife's village?

577
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,677
-For some reason, Arab doesn't like us.
-Your wife's village? Shame on you!

578
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,714
What's likeable about the gossip hole?
You think I'd throw my arms round it?

579
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,234
-There's no smoke without fire.
-Just eat up, Tevfik, you ass-kisser.

580
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,078
Got any cola?

581
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,192
The lad wants cola.
There isn't any. Is ayran OK?

582
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,357
Cola? Give him water.

583
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,035
-Arab!
-Right, OK.

584
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,993
Mr Prosecutor, we still haven't
sorted out that cemetery business.

585
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,557
-Sorry, I'm going to bore you now.
-Not at all.

586
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,356
Can you talk to the district governor?
He'll listen to you.

587
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,990
Sure, I'll talk to the governor,
but what's the business about?

588
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,752
It's nothing really.

589
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,676
We want to fix the cemetery wall
but just can't get the funding.

590
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,039
Well?

591
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,637
The wall's in ruins, so animals go
and shit there, pardon my language.

592
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,352
It's misery for the dead
and a nuisance for the villagers.

593
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,354
The main thing is to knock down
the outbuildings by the entrance...

594
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,071
...and build a nice morgue there.
It's been okayed by the village elders.

595
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,471
-Build what?
-A morgue. And a body-washing room.

596
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,949
A morgue with a body-washing room.

597
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,790
The project's ready,
the paperwork's all done...

598
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,199
...but we can't get started
without the contract or funding.

599
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,759
Mr. Naci, it's essential, believe me.

600
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:52,820
If we manage to pull it off, the village will have
a great masterpiece.

601
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,875
I swear to God, we don't know
what to do with the dead in summer.

602
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,552
-Why?
-They smell.

603
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,917
-Try burying them.
-Why wait? Bury them.

604
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,478
We would, but the village
has suffered from emigration.

605
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,394
-Emigration?
-There's only old folk left.

606
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,399
Now when brides and daughters
start phoning from Istanbul..

607
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,519
We have a lot of relatives in Germany.
They want to come and see the body.

608
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,839
You get them on the phone saying,
'Don't bury dad, I have to kiss him. '

609
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,351
Fine, but the man smells.
Where are you going to kiss him?

610
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,432
What can you say? You have to wait.

611
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,180
They haven't been back in 10 years,
but the parents are here.

612
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,152
Only old people are left.

613
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,108
It takes someone to die
before they think of the village.

614
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,395
When I say this, the gossip starts.
That's my real problem.

615
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,080
What do they say?

616
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,637
That I'll squander village money
on a morgue. As if there's any money!

617
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,472
It's only gossip of course,
God forbid.

618
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,273
My sons are doing all right,
thank the Lord.

619
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,598
I've raised them.
They've fiown the nest.

620
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,878
The oldest is in the defense industry
in Kirikkale. He's doing fine.

621
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,392
I have two grandchildren there.
The second's a policeman in Canakkale.

622
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,880
-Great.
-In Yenice.

623
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,154
A colleague for you, Izzet.

624
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,629
Next down is a girl.
We married her to a sergeant.

625
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,792
So we're doing all right.
The kids are all right.

626
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,673
But the villagers are dirt poor.
They aren't well off.

627
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,037
-How many terms have you done?
-This year, God willing...

628
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,511
-... I'll be standing for a third term.
-Look at that!

629
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,355
I had absolutely no intention
of standing this time, believe me.

630
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,668
But the neighbours insisted.

631
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,560
You have a son?

632
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,671
-What, at home?
-You have a son?

633
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,071
-I told you, I have two. The first...
-Yes, in the defense industry.

634
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,993
There's no one left at home.

635
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,995
Just the wife and Sinan, bless him.
He helps out.

636
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,469
-Thanks, Mrs Mukhtar. It was great.
-Thank you.

637
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:09,589
And there's number four,
the youngest girl, Cemile.

638
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:14,233
No one except her.
She's the last, an afterthought.

639
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,912
We manage, thank the Lord.

640
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,074
And when friends like you turn up,
it's an honor and delight.

641
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,511
But I tell you,
the meat is out of this world.

642
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,758
-Isn't it?
-It's lamb, right?

643
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,074
Lamb. It's all we eat, chief.
We only eat lamb at home.

644
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,913
-Some don't. They say it smells.
-They say that.

645
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,980
But lamb is the meat to eat.

646
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,472
-Why aren't you having any?
-I just have.

647
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:53,589
-Can't you fix the fellow a sandwich?
-I am, mukhtar. Don't worry.

648
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,637
Sure, we have to feed our main man.

649
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,395
-Thanks a lot.
-Enjoy it, Mr Prosecutor.

650
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,233
-Doctor, that's pure comb honey.
-Comb honey?

651
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,359
-Right. A must for putting on bread.
-Mukhtar, it's delicious, really.

652
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,636
Could you spare me a small jar?

653
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:18,515
Sinan! Find a jar this size.
Clean it up, and get your aunt

654
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,276
to fill it with honey.

655
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,114
They'll pick it up when they go.

656
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,436
Don't hold back, for goodness sake.

657
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,831
Some more bread. And pickles.

658
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,676
-There you go.
-It's the wind.

659
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,717
The same thing happened yesterday.
It'll come back in 15 minutes.

660
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,394
Mukhtar, forget the morgue.
Get the village electricity fixed.

661
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,993
First, the electricity.

662
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,199
What was that saying about
having no money to..? Never mind.

663
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,676
Mr. Naci, we have many problems.
They're all important.

664
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,478
But this is the wind.

665
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,312
Cemile!

666
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,755
Cemile, come here a minute, girl!

667
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,519
Two lamps.

668
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,952
One for the toilet, one for here.
Off you go now.

669
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,551
It'll come back.
It will.

670
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,755
It'll come back.

671
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:23,553
God give us health before all else.
Electricity, water, the rest will come.

672
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,553
The wind's been wild
this past week, you know.

673
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,558
Cemile!

674
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,958
Thanks a lot.

675
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,953
Cemile, my girl!

676
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,756
-Mukhtar, where was that toilet?
-You can't go on your own.

677
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,157
Here, wait. Let me lead the way.

678
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,309
You follow me.

679
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,075
Let's have a smoke.

680
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,750
Bring the lamps in here, girl.
Look, I told you two lamps.

681
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,912
Mr. Naci, come on.

682
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,438
It's no good without you.

683
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:14,594
Don't think I didn't see you laugh
when I mentioned elections just now.

684
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,037
He who holds the honey jar
gets to lick his fingers, right?

685
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,478
And you say
you'd never marry from here.

686
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,279
Thanks.

687
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,038
Yasar!

688
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,190
Aren't you dead?

689
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,793
Kenan!

690
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,390
Hey, Kenan!

691
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,119
C'mon, get up!

692
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,039
I'm not done with you yet.
Get up!

693
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,960
What did I say? No sleeping
before we're done with this!

694
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,839
Now get up!
Izzet, bring him along.

695
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,715
-Shall I get the store opened for soda?
-No, forget food and drink.

696
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:27,632
Is there nothing to sit on in there?

697
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,553
-Shall I bring a chair, chief?
-No, forget it.

698
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,351
'You got to allow for that,' he says.
'You have her left or right in bed?'

699
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,431
So I say, 'What's the difference?'

700
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:49,470
He goes, 'Do it the other way round
and you'll get one hell of a headache. '

701
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,719
Well, a mukhtar like that
produces an angel like that..

702
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,560
Extraordinary.

703
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,437
But what a waste.

704
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,308
She'll just fade away
in this godforsaken village.

705
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,719
The beautiful usually have
a bad fortune, doctor.

706
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,272
So why did you say that woman died?

707
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,314
Which woman?

708
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:56,274
The woman you described as gorgeous?

709
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,039
Your friend's wife.

710
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:02,671
What was the cause of her death?
I mean, what did the doctors say?

711
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,352
There really was no cause.

712
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,470
As I said,
it was the most bizarre death.

713
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,351
One day, the guy said to his wife...

714
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:32,277
'Let's sell the old banger by autumn
and get a decent car instead. '

715
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,075
The woman answered,
'Do what you like. '

716
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,953
'I won't be here in autumn anyway.
I'll be dead. '

717
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,515
The guy made nothing of it at first.
He thought his wife was joking.

718
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,118
But the woman said,
'It's no joke. I'm serious. '

719
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,678
'I tell you, I'm going to die
after having the baby,' she said.

720
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,798
The guy was annoyed naturally.

721
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,511
But he didn't dwell on it too much
because the woman was pregnant.

722
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,356
As you know, women tend to be
a bit volatile when they're pregnant.

723
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,559
They can get terribly gloomy.
So the guy put it down to that.

724
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,871
He didn't dwell on her words.

725
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,520
But...

726
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,432
...the next day,
it was the same words again.

727
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,197
Then came the day of the birth.

728
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,639
It went quite normally
and they had a healthy baby girl.

729
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:32,512
Before long, the woman was at home
lying in bed...

730
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,953
...and wanted to cuddle the baby.

731
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,350
So they brought her the baby.

732
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,634
The woman gave the baby
a kiss and a cuddle and so on.

733
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,473
And afterwards...

734
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,479
...she said,
'Well, I can die now. '

735
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:58,540
And sure enough, she died soon after
right in front of everyone's eyes.

736
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,956
There you go, doctor.
Those are the facts.

737
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,273
She died the very minute
she said she would.

738
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,593
Let's see what sense
you can make of them now.

739
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,995
Well, was there an autopsy?

740
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,392
Why?

741
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,676
To get a clearer picture
of the cause of death.

742
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,559
You haven't been listening.
The cause of death was clear.

743
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,154
Anyway, if there'd been
anything suspicious...

744
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,799
...you think I'd have let it go?

745
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,474
No one dies
because they say they will.

746
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,955
She must have poisoned herself
or something.

747
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,712
Poisoned herself?

748
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,154
What gives you that idea, doctor?

749
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,154
If there'd been anything suspicious,
wouldn't we have acted on it?

750
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,709
I'm a prosecutor.
It's my job to be suspicious.

751
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,158
We'd have looked into it, of course.
But the doctors said a heart attack.

752
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,069
There was a report saying so then.

753
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,430
Honestly, I still think...

754
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,436
...an autopsy
would have been better.

755
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,388
Come on! You don't need an autopsy
if the cause of death is clear.

756
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,035
Because it was clear.

757
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,998
A heart attack.

758
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,279
You'd be right,
if the cause of death was unknown.

759
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,077
Besides,...

760
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,709
...her family
saw no need for an autopsy.

761
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,780
Carving up
a beautiful young woman for no reason.

762
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,860
There you have it, doctor,
how the loveliest woman left this life.

763
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,325
But then, there's also this.

764
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:48,037
Some drugs can trigger it,
but obviously I can't tell now.

765
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,553
What?

766
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,197
Some drugs can trigger
a heart attack if taken in high doses.

767
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,274
It just came to mind.

768
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:03,198
-Mr. Nusret, how about a tea?
-No, thanks. I've had some already.

769
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,590
-Don't be shy, for heaven's sake.
-Thanks, mukhtar.

770
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,673
I'm so embarrassed
about the power failure.

771
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,232
But there's nothing I can do.

772
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,472
Mr Prosecutor,
can you come here a minute?

773
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,152
-It's got a bit complicated.
-How?

774
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,795
The guy says it's his kid.

775
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:46,278
-Which kid?
-The victim Yasar's son.

776
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,878
Yasar supposedly didn't know.
He thought he was the father.

777
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:56,117
He says on the night of the incident
he was drunk and it just slipped out.

778
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,150
You want to come and have a word?

779
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,990
Let me have a word then.

780
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,790
-Is that 'bazlama' bread?
-Yes.

781
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,077
-It smells great.
-Help yourself.

782
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,351
Thanks. I'm full actually but..

783
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,911
-The smell.
-Right.

784
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,471
-Arab!
-Boss?

785
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,351
Come here, c'mon!

786
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,317
-Give me a cigarette.
-What?

787
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,837
Give me a cigarette.

788
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,319
Hand it over.

789
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,035
That mayor's daughter..

790
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,718
She's beautiful.

791
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,751
It's here.

792
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,076
Abidin, record that before it's ruined.
Then put them in an envelope.

793
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,678
What the hell is that?

794
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,793
God, all we needed was a dog.

795
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,838
Shoo! Fuck off!

796
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,433
Shoo!

797
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,193
Izzet!

798
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,038
Mr Prosecutor!

799
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,396
We've found it.

800
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:50,118
Diggers, move it! Faster!

801
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,472
Just don't touch!

802
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,718
Let Abidin get it on camera first.
Abidin!

803
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,276
Over here!

804
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,715
I expect the dogs dug it up, right?

805
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,956
I expect so.

806
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,071
OK, that'll do. That's fine.

807
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,478
Hayrettin, let's...

808
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,553
Start gently from the edges.
Dig around him like this.

809
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:00,269
Then lift him out here. OK?
Now take it slowly.

810
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,193
Careful! Hold it there. Not the head!

811
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,318
-Look, grab the shoulders.
-The shoulders.

812
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:11,028
-Slowly! Slow down.
-Give that here. Hold this.

813
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,558
He'll come out now.

814
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,391
Go on, lift him.

815
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,794
There we go.
Tevfik, give a hand here.

816
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,789
Goodness sake!

817
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,509
Careful, guys, for God's sake!

818
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,633
Don't turn him over.
Lift him as he is, guys.

819
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,279
Two, three..

820
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:00,035
Here, over here. Bring him over!

821
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,711
Put him here.

822
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,673
Arab! Pull up his trousers.

823
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,992
OK.

824
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,718
Look at that!

825
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:00,958
What way is that to tie someone up?
Is that human, Mr Prosecutor?

826
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,750
It's inhuman!

827
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,955
Look, you killed him,
but why tie him up like that?

828
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:15,950
What about respect for the dead?
Got none of that either? Sadist shit!

829
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:19,596
-Naci, just calm down.
-Look at him! Why tie the guy up?

830
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,876
-Naci!
-You're not human!

831
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:27,980
Naci, calm down for God's sake! Huh?
Look, we still have work to do here!

832
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,313
-You're not human! Sadist shit!
-Naci!

833
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,836
Naci, come over here. Come on.

834
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:42,033
-Look, you've done a good job.
-They shouldn't be treated like humans!

835
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,749
They just deserve
to be tied up just like him.

836
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,838
OK. Come over here.

837
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,677
I'm the one who killed Yasar.

838
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,320
Shut the fuck up! Moron!

839
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,948
Your work's done.
The rest is my job.

840
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,111
Just calm down. Huh?

841
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:15,556
Let's get the job done
as fast as possible.

842
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,197
Yes, now let's...

843
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,397
Let's continue.

844
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:34,956
Doctor, let's now draft
a crime scene investigation report.

845
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,515
-Sure.
-Abidin, you get ready too.

846
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,314
Tevfik's getting the laptop
from the car, Mr Prosecutor.

847
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,869
Quick! Hurry!
There's still a lot to do.

848
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,553
Bring it here.

849
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,316
Take this to the car.

850
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,509
Almost ready, Mr Prosecutor.

851
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,478
Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

852
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,431
Get typing then.

853
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:10,314
Location: Kizilcullu.

854
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,519
...in the north of
the administrative district...

855
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,750
Sergeant, what do you say?
Is this Kizilcullu here?

856
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,718
Well, Mr Prosecutor,
it's like this.

857
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,316
The Fountain
is right on the border.

858
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:29,109
This side is Saricullu,
the other side Kizilcullu.

859
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,912
-So?
-Well, it's quite simple.

860
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,511
Suppose we drew a line
between us and the fountain.

861
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:41,791
This side to the north is Kizilcullu
and the south side Saricullu.

862
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,358
-Sir...
-Meaning?

863
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,671
Well, if you look
at the map coordinates...

864
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:51,032
...it'll tell you exactly
whether this is Kizilcullu or..

865
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,919
Well, we could say Kizilcullu,
but it also tends towards Saricullu.

866
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:58,039
Being outside the municipal limits,
I know this point very well.

867
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,636
-The municipal map actually marks this...
-OK.

868
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:07,700
-... as the exact boundary point.
-OK. Location, Saricullu.

869
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,828
...in the vicinity of Kavurgali village...

870
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:17,278
...around how many km
from the municipal seat?

871
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:23,940
-I'd say we've come 30 km.
-We're currently 37 km away, sir.

872
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,316
...37 km from the municipal seat.

873
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:36,860
A visit was made to the field beside
the fountain at the above location.

874
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,949
Within the said roadside field..

875
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,029
It's a good 25-30 m, right?

876
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,430
-I can measure it, sir.
-No need, sergeant.

877
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,878
It was verified
that the corpse lay buried...

878
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:57,749
...some 30 m from the edge.

879
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:02,235
The ground was dug up...

880
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:08,149
...and the body exhumed
by the appointed officers.

881
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,352
It was observed...

882
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,394
...that the corpse...

883
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,430
...had been hogtied.

884
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,236
-Have you got that?
-Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

885
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,231
The rope was cut.

886
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:32,313
Hayrettin, cut the rope now.

887
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,438
No, not here.

888
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,113
That's right.

889
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:46,878
That's it.

890
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:57,115
Turn him over on his back.

891
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,120
Yes, now.

892
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,598
Open a new paragraph.

893
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,876
-Abidin.
-Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

894
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,070
The corpse was clothed...

895
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:20,580
...in a pair of dark blue,
heavy-duty work trousers...

896
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:27,700
...and a yellow and grey shirt.
-Your man's going for it.

897
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,634
-He's twittering.
-We slog all night, you just revel.

898
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,153
-New paragraph, Abidin.
-Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

899
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:40,792
The thing to be in life
is a master of revels.

900
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,950
Tevfik, count this.

901
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:49,713
The male corpse measured 180 cm tall.

902
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,754
How old is the victim, doctor?

903
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,433
-I think we could say 35-40.
-You are right.

904
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,397
Was aged 35-40...

905
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:09,116
...looked like Clark Gable...

906
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:16,276
...weighed an estimated 80-90 kg..

907
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,959
Abidin, you've got that
word for word, huh?

908
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:47,838
You look a bit like Clark Gable,
you know, Mr Prosecutor?

909
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,710
-Sorry, but...
-OK, stop the banter.

910
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,519
Let's be serious now.

911
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,636
Where were we?

912
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,998
-Weighed an estimated 80-90 kg..
-Yes, 80-90 kg.

913
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,709
Had a moustache...

914
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:09,958
...and three-four days' beard growth.

915
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:15,519
It was verified that rigor mortis...
What shall we say here, doctor?

916
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,235
We could say
rigor mortis had worn off.

917
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,840
OK.

918
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:26,954
It was verified that rigor mortis
had worn off in the arms and legs.

919
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,399
Have you got that?

920
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,750
Due to physical circumstances...
Well, what shall we say?

921
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,674
We can't do an autopsy here,
so let's say something like this:

922
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,912
...unsuitable conditions necessitated...

923
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:45,074
...that an autopsy be performed
at the state hospital.

924
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,878
You're right. Yes.

925
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:50,112
Due to circumstances being ill-suited
to the performance of an autopsy...

926
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:56,220
...and because hospital conditions
would be more appropriate...

927
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:03,020
...it was decided to have
a conventional autopsy performed...

928
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,749
...to transfer the corpse to town...

929
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,239
...to establish
the exact cause of death...

930
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,953
...to drive the corpse to town...

931
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:18,190
...in one of
the investigation vehicles.

932
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,634
That's OK, isn't it?

933
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,797
-Right, Mr Prosecutor.
-Yes.

934
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:26,268
Hayrettin! Go and get him ready
to take away.

935
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:29,917
Put him in a body bag first.

936
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:49,117
At university...

937
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,000
...people used to
call me Clark Nusret...

938
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,594
...by the way.

939
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:59,910
But really, you look a lot
like Clark Gable, Mr Prosecutor.

940
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,318
No body bag.

941
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,673
-No?
-No.

942
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,558
-You didn't bring the body bag?
-Did you?

943
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,680
-But I told you!
-What's up?

944
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,714
Tevfik forgot the body bag,
Mr Prosecutor.

945
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:30,030
Bringing body bags isn't my job!

946
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,998
-I told you to get it though.
-When did you tell me?

947
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:34,199
OK, cut it out!

948
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:37,875
-Before going to the courthouse.
-Cut it out!

949
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,272
How could you forget
the goddamn body bag?

950
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,878
You knew where we were going!

951
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,278
Hayrettin, grab a blanket.
Run! Quick!

952
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,277
When did your village
ever turn out any real men?

953
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,910
Quick!

954
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,077
Look who's talking!
Ratting at the first chance...

955
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:11,277
You guys lend a hand too!

956
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,354
OK, let's do this head to toe.

957
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,118
You go there.

958
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,671
Will you help, sergeant?

959
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,669
Come on!

960
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,272
Put on his shoes.

961
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:43,078
-Grab the rope. It's evidence, right?
-Of course.

962
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:46,676
Fold it over like me.
Go on, fold it!

963
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,473
OK, one, two, three..

964
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,832
Sergeant, bring my laptop, OK?

965
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,193
And don't forget the evidence.
Look, there on the ground.

966
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,273
Izzet, c'mon!

967
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,950
Really, I'm curious, you know.

968
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,995
Seeing as you killed the guy,
why go and tie him up like this?

969
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:30,235
He didn't fit in the car otherwise.

970
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,994
Oh, really?

971
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,197
Why on earth
didn't we get an ambulance?

972
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:39,670
I phoned for one before we set out,
but the ambulance had broken down.

973
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,833
-I'll call again now, if you like.
-We're not waiting for that as well.

974
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,671
Now, what are we doing?
Which boot is bigger?

975
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:50,469
-Arab's is, capacity-wise.
-C'mon, Tevfik!

976
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,635
This boot's bigger than yours?

977
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:57,035
Right, there's the LPG tank.

978
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,999
-In this one too.
-He won't fit in either.

979
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,310
What do we do then?

980
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,712
Oh, God!

981
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:12,398
What should we do? I wonder
if we should hogtie him again?

982
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:13,914
What?

983
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,069
He won't fit unless he's tied up.
Look.

984
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:21,194
No, there's no need
for tying him up.

985
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:25,672
If we bend him forwards
he'll probably fit. Let's try.

986
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:30,477
-OK, let's try then.
-Quick, the rain is on its way.

987
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:33,474
Here, c'mon. Turn him like this.

988
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,593
Easy does it.

989
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,353
Now bend him.

990
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:40,069
Now the head.

991
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,676
Head forwards.

992
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,598
-There, OK. C'mon..
-OK. One, two, three, here we go!

993
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,076
Leave his head like that.
That's it.

994
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,551
Lift! C'mon, Tevfik, lift!

995
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,679
-OK, careful.
-Slowly now.

996
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,349
That won't do.
Lift from there.

997
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:05,559
OK, don't yell, Arab.

998
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,597
Put the feet down.

999
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:09,199
Watch out, Tevfik!

1000
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,879
What the fuck you want?

1001
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,231
Right, OK.

1002
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,995
Hayrettin! You and Ethem
switch to this car.

1003
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,912
OK, hold it. Let go.

1004
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:25,109
-Easy, Arab! You'll bust my head.
-Izzet! You and Kenan in my car!

1005
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,276
C'mon, Arab!

1006
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:57,913
I had two years on the murder desk
before here.

1007
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,197
With Sacit, now the boss in Antep.
I hope his ears are burning.

1008
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,432
He was a great guy,
though no better than you.

1009
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,229
He'd say wherever you find
a can of worms, look for a woman.

1010
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:11,273
Be sure to look for
an issue with a woman.

1011
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:15,593
And truly, all these years
the guy hasn't once proved wrong.

1012
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,960
Right, but this guy
was a right son of a gun, boss.

1013
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,590
-Who?
-The dead guy.

1014
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,877
Live like a rat, die like a rat.

1015
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,873
I wouldn't know about that.
I don't want to either.

1016
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,589
That's it for me, my friend.

1017
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,599
My job's done.
It's over to the prosecutor now.

1018
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:39,270
Let him clear up the mess.
It's not my business.

1019
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:44,591
Doctor, what time's the autopsy?
Remember I wanted that prescription?

1020
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:48,675
I don't know what time it'll be.
But I'll be there.

1021
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:51,309
-Come whenever you like.
-OK. Thanks.

1022
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:54,790
Let me not forget it,
or the wife will, you know..

1023
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,674
Too bad, chief. Looks like
you've started smoking again.

1024
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,559
Well, doctor. I give up,
but the damn thing won't give me up.

1025
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:03,393
You were doing so well.
What happened all of a sudden?

1026
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:06,518
It wasn't all of a sudden, doctor.

1027
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,116
I've been a policeman 20 years.

1028
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:13,598
The types I've seen.
Man or beast? You can't tell.

1029
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:17,591
Then there's the likes of Kenan.
I mean, they're different.

1030
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:22,390
They're.. How can I say?
It's like they get you...

1031
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:26,998
...with that nerve,
that thing they have.

1032
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,751
At the mayor's place...

1033
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:34,154
...the guy says, 'He's my brother.
My mum left him in my hands. '

1034
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:38,678
'Don't do this or that to him. '
He's almost saying, 'Let him go. '

1035
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:44,831
I whacked him again and said,
'Stop giving us the run-around!'

1036
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:49,155
And you know what he says to me?
'You're a decent guy. '

1037
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,437
'The boy's mine. '

1038
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,758
'Can you watch out for him
while I'm in jail,' he says.

1039
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:57,992
-Was he talking about Yasar's boy?
-Right. Yasar's boy.

1040
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:01,232
-He says he's the father.
-No way. That's a lie.

1041
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,754
Do you laugh or cry?

1042
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:08,074
I beat the guy up and he makes me
responsible for his son.

1043
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:13,271
The other day I saw your boy
playing in the park with his mum.

1044
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,034
-He looked fine.
-He is. Just fine.

1045
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:19,351
There's no problem
as long as he takes his pills.

1046
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:23,794
And he's one smart kid.
The answers he comes up with..

1047
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,437
They say his illness has to do with
having an extra-high IQ.

1048
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,800
Right.

1049
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,793
But the wife never stops
saying the same thing.

1050
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:35,671
'Why did God pick us?' she says.
I mean, why us?

1051
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:40,035
I say, 'You can't fight it.
You can't ask questions like that. '

1052
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,635
It's a sin. You can't question it.

1053
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:47,635
There's a reason for everything,
end of story. If it's meant to be...

1054
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:17,359
Move along, c'mon.

1055
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,798
Calm now, guys!

1056
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:36,114
Move over this way, my friend.
The doctor will fill you in.

1057
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,396
-Over this way now.
-Can't you tell us something?

1058
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:41,711
They will!
Now move along. This way. Guys!

1059
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:44,872
-Fill us in, chief.
-OK, they will! Move over!

1060
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:46,388
Clear the way.

1061
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,314
Izzet, put him
in the gendarmerie car.

1062
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,639
The gendarmerie car.

1063
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,198
He's going to the courthouse.

1064
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,033
You know the procedure.
Take them both to the courthouse.

1065
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,838
All right, sir.

1066
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,519
Bastard!

1067
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:13,359
Move back!

1068
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,272
Bastard!

1069
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:34,980
-Murderer! Hand him over!
-Bastard!

1070
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,148
Look, I've seen you all!

1071
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:42,039
Hey, leave off!
Stop hitting the car!

1072
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,633
Murderer! Bastard!

1073
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,551
What idiot took him out of the car?

1074
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:51,392
The prosecutor told me to, boss.

1075
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,471
I said
it was a bad idea, but..

1076
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,840
OK, hold it.

1077
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,076
Izzet, get in the car.

1078
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:00,918
Doctor, police chief Naci
is here. He's downstairs.

1079
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:03,674
-OK, I'm on my way.
-OK.

1080
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,711
Morning, doctor.

1081
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:47,994
The mayor's here.
What should I tell him?

1082
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,958
-I'll see him later.
-All right.

1083
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,830
Excuse me a minute. Excuse me.

1084
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,668
-I'm disturbing you, doctor.
-Not at all.

1085
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,552
-Welcome, M. Naci.
-Thanks.

1086
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,678
I thought I'd get that prescription
before going home.

1087
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,149
-Do you mind doing it?
-No, of course not.

1088
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:10,353
-How many packs did we say? Two?
-Same as before, two.

1089
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:16,071
I'll do it right away.
Let me just find the pad.

1090
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:21,153
-You must be worn out after last night.
-Too right, doctor.

1091
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:26,715
Honestly, this job
is punishing after a certain age.

1092
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,395
But you can guess
what it's like with the boy.

1093
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,915
It's hard to stick around at home.

1094
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:37,231
You find you can't take it.
So you go off to work again.

1095
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,672
That's right.

1096
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:45,471
-It's the only thing to do.
-For me it is. But why for you?

1097
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:50,829
You're still so young.
Believe me, if I were you...

1098
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:56,480
...I'd pack my bags and clear off
without a second thought, damn it!

1099
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:01,910
-Where to?
-Wherever.

1100
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:20,113
I shouldn't rant on at you
so early in the morning, doctor.

1101
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:21,918
No, please.

1102
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:26,512
You're a city boy, doctor.
You don't know how tough life is here.

1103
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:31,033
Especially if you're a boy
and your dad's never around.

1104
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,400
That's why I feel
a bit sorry for the kid.

1105
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,632
You think Kenan
is really the father?

1106
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,152
No idea.

1107
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:45,271
But after the kid threw a stone at him
he cried all the way to the courthouse.

1108
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:50,073
It's the kids who suffer
in the end, doctor.

1109
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:53,398
Everyone pays for the things they do.

1110
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,310
But kids pay for the sins of adults.

1111
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:36,513
-So he turned up in Girmacakil?
-Yes.

1112
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,839
That's at least 40-50 km away.
You did well to find him.

1113
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:45,311
God, what were they doing
taking him all the way there?

1114
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:47,119
Well, they just did.

1115
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:51,751
I couldn't sleep that morning,
so I opened the pharmacy early.

1116
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:53,878
At 7.30 or so.

1117
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,233
I looked over and saw
the door to Yasar's place open.

1118
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:01,399
'God,' I thought. 'What's the guy
doing here at this hour?'

1119
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:06,031
And what was weirder,
he had a paintbrush in his hand.

1120
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:08,111
And he was painting
the shutters at that hour.

1121
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,748
Anyway, I went home and back
in the meantime.

1122
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:14,555
When I got back, the place was shut
and the painting left half-finished.

1123
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,513
Fate..

1124
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:19,270
Well, you know the tea man, Riza?

1125
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:22,279
He swears he saw Yasar in Kirikkale
only yesterday evening?

1126
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:24,112
No way.
The asshole's lying again.

1127
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:25,508
Yesterday evening?

1128
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:27,716
Come on! The guy died days ago.

1129
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:32,036
What do I know? Riza says
he called out, but he didn't hear.

1130
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:35,232
He was walking along
in a world of his own.

1131
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:30,712
-Come in, doctor. What's up?
-Morning, Hamit.

1132
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,085
-Morning.
-How are you?

1133
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:36,716
-Fine, thanks. Have a tea.
-No, thanks. I was just passing.

1134
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:38,876
What are you making us for lunch?

1135
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:42,919
Green beans, soup and salad.

1136
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:50,917
-Did you say beans?
-Yes, beans.

1137
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:54,917
-Any meat in it?
-No, no meat.

1138
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:00,400
What's he up to?

1139
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:07,916
-He was hungry so I gave him breakfast.
-Good for you.

1140
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:58,480
Hello?

1141
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:06,674
OK, Abidin.

1142
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:08,480
Good.

1143
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:23,709
The autopsy room will be ready
in five or ten minutes.

1144
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:27,479
-They'll give us a call.
-OK.

1145
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:09,035
What's up, Mr Prosecutor?

1146
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:13,432
Well, doctor. You're some guy.

1147
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:15,679
What does that mean?

1148
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:19,515
I've reached this age and never met
anyone as skeptical as you.

1149
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:22,713
-What's happened?
-Nothing.

1150
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:30,118
It's just been
weighing on me a bit.

1151
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,039
What?

1152
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,197
That drug business. Remember
you talked about certain drugs...

1153
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,518
...being able to cause a heart attack
if taken in high doses?

1154
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:41,671
Yes, there are drugs like that.
Why?

1155
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:45,359
What I don't understand is this.

1156
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:51,599
Why would the woman suddenly
take the drugs for no good reason?

1157
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:56,114
Maybe there was a personal problem
she couldn't deal with.

1158
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:00,759
She wanted to kill herself
and be spared. How do I know?

1159
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:02,638
Kill herself?

1160
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:05,918
What suddenly gives you that idea?

1161
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:10,719
-Nothing, I...
-You're so bizarre, you know.

1162
02:02:11,640 --> 02:02:14,518
I'm just guessing.

1163
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:23,919
If the woman was so troubled,
wouldn't it show?

1164
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:25,792
Yes, of course.

1165
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:31,552
Her friends, her husband
should have realized.

1166
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,398
-Were they on good terms?
-Huh?

1167
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:41,913
-Did they get along well?
-Sure. Very well.

1168
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,073
Why?

1169
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:50,349
I don't know, just asking.

1170
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:03,913
True, they had a few minor problems.
But I mean...

1171
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,714
-... the kind you get in any family.
-I see.

1172
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,398
Only...

1173
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:21,995
...one day, she caught her husband
with another woman.

1174
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:25,239
They didn't make a thing of it.
She forgave him right away.

1175
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:30,117
But women don't easily forgive
that sort of thing.

1176
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:34,755
She did though.
She really forgave him.

1177
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:40,231
They didn't even mention it again.

1178
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:43,835
Well, there you go.

1179
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,356
The woman made up her mind
to kill herself right back then.

1180
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:51,315
She waited until after the birth
so as not to harm the baby.

1181
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:52,913
No, come on!

1182
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,717
I really don't think so.

1183
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:02,710
For one thing, the guy
did nothing really wrong.

1184
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,274
It was some ridiculous thing
that happened when he was drunk.

1185
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:10,512
Nothing to write home about.
You couldn't even call it cheating.

1186
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:15,710
The woman must have thought the same
because she forgave the guy right off.

1187
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:21,469
No one dies just like that.
There's no such thing in medicine.

1188
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:24,788
Well.

1189
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:30,992
What sort of drugs are you talking?
The kind sold over the counter?

1190
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:34,876
-Sure. Digoxin, for example.
-Digoxin?

1191
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:38,755
It's a heart drug. High doses
cause a heart attack.

1192
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:43,913
-There are others too.
-No, I know Digoxin.

1193
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:46,913
My father-in-law took it.

1194
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:51,509
-Small, yellow tablets?
-Yes. They come like that too.

1195
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,231
Digoxin, huh?

1196
02:04:58,760 --> 02:04:59,960
Hello?

1197
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:02,952
What's going on, Sakir?

1198
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:08,319
We should come down?

1199
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:14,110
We'll come down then.

1200
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:17,511
OK, we're on our way.

1201
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:23,354
The autopsy room's ready.
We can go, Mr Prosecutor.

1202
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,319
Mr Prosecutor?

1203
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,957
Shall we go, Mr Prosecutor?

1204
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:46,994
Let's go, doctor.

1205
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:51,519
-After you.
-Look, doctor..

1206
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:55,110
Would a person...

1207
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:58,070
...really kill themselves...

1208
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:03,670
...to punish someone else?
Would they do that, doctor.

1209
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:10,540
Aren't most suicides intended
to punish someone else, Mr Prosecutor?

1210
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:17,960
Yes, aren't they?

1211
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,235
Bravo.

1212
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:25,477
That's what I thought.

1213
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:31,114
That's it, of course.

1214
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:38,513
Let's go. What are we waiting for?

1215
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:55,840
My wife...

1216
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:05,519
Women can sometimes be
very ruthless, doctor. Really.

1217
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:07,479
Very.

1218
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:28,872
Hello, guys.

1219
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:31,991
-Are we all set?
-Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

1220
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,520
Good.

1221
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:42,433
-Who's going to identify the body?
-His wife's outside, Mr Prosecutor.

1222
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:46,514
OK, call her in.
Let's get started right away.

1223
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:53,236
Mrs. Toprak, this way.
Come on in.

1224
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:58,197
-How are you, Sakir?
-Fine, thanks, Mr Prosecutor.

1225
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:00,994
-Here, in here.
-What happened with the accountant?

1226
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:05,028
I talked to him, Mr Prosecutor.
But it's no use.

1227
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,918
The accountant's no use.

1228
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:08,718
Whatever. It'll work out.

1229
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:12,111
-Because these instruments...
-I understand, OK.

1230
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,118
-Stand by the prosecutor, please.
-Over here, young lady.

1231
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:28,912
Are you Gulnaz Toprak?

1232
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:30,748
OK.

1233
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,958
Pull the sheet down, Sakir.

1234
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:42,637
Is this your husband?

1235
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,200
Huh?

1236
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:54,958
Mrs. Toprak?

1237
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:59,393
Is this your husband?

1238
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:06,757
I'm asking if it's your husband.

1239
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:09,960
Yes.

1240
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:13,719
Are you sure?

1241
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,080
OK.

1242
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:23,510
Cover him up, Sakir.

1243
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:30,470
Now, where were we? OK.

1244
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:36,109
Then his wife Gulnaz Toprak
was admitted to view the body.

1245
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:39,115
She was duly sworn in.

1246
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:43,110
-Are you typing this, Abidin?
-Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

1247
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:47,718
She was shown the body
and asked to identify it.

1248
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:53,189
And she answered,
'The body you've shown me... '

1249
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:57,429
'... belongs to my husband,
Yasar Toprak. '

1250
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:06,700
'His mother's name was Hatice,
his father's name Rustem. '

1251
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:12,313
'He was born in 1979.'

1252
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:19,549
'Yes, I went to the prosecutor
as he hadn't been home for two days. '

1253
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:22,515
-Is that right, young lady?
-Yes.

1254
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:27,233
'I don't know how he died. '

1255
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:31,718
'I have thus identified the body. '

1256
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:34,828
-Have you got that, Abidin?
-Yes, Mr Prosecutor.

1257
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:38,670
But let me see what you've written.

1258
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:43,519
-Last thing was 'identified the body. '
-No! You don't type it there.

1259
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:46,513
How many times have I told you?
Type above, leaving a space below.

1260
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:49,877
-I'll do it again. The date.
-Go on, type the date.

1261
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:54,990
But look, that's too much now.
Delete that.

1262
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:57,830
-Here too?
-Yes, there too.

1263
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,992
So there's space
for the doctor's autopsy report.

1264
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:09,829
-Cut that too. Yes, there.
-I'll paste it here.

1265
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:14,836
Good. Look, now it's all moved down.

1266
02:12:15,160 --> 02:12:19,392
No, move them up.
His father's and mother's names.

1267
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:22,154
OK, I'm moving them up.

1268
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:30,950
-OK, now start typing here.
-OK, Mr Prosecutor.

1269
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:35,952
Yes.

1270
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:37,798
Where were we?

1271
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:39,880
Yes.

1272
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:45,914
OK, young lady. You're done.
You can go. My condolences to you.

1273
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:51,516
Mrs. Toprak, just wait
in the corridor for a bit.

1274
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:10,355
Mr Prosecutor, he had a watch
a ring and the like on him.

1275
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:14,678
-Should I hand them over right now?
-Yes. Put them in an envelope first.

1276
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:18,829
And his clothes as well?
I mean, after taking them off.

1277
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:23,035
Yes. Once they're off,
put them in a bag and hand them over.

1278
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:26,317
They're torn and bloodstained.
That's why I'm asking.

1279
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:29,108
That's OK.

1280
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:16,519
Yes, we can continue, Mr Prosecutor.

1281
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:34,279
-Huh?
-I'm ready.

1282
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:36,757
-Are you back?
-Yes.

1283
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:51,597
Yes, OK then. Now let's...

1284
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:58,149
Let's move on to the doctor.

1285
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:02,112
The doctor was admitted
to view the body.

1286
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,956
He was duly sworn in.

1287
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:10,634
He was shown the body.

1288
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:16,589
He was asked the cause of death.

1289
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:22,359
He answered,
'Because the cause of death... '

1290
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:26,710
'... cannot be established
within the scope of the evidence... '

1291
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:30,028
'.there is call for
a conventional autopsy. '

1292
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:32,709
Absolutely.

1293
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:52,358
Yes.

1294
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:56,191
Yes, doctor.

1295
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:59,517
That's it.

1296
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:03,115
The ball's in your court.

1297
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:06,158
I'm off.

1298
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:14,913
-Send me a copy of the report.
-OK, Mr Prosecutor.

1299
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:19,153
-Take it easy then.
-Thanks, Mr Prosecutor.

1300
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:32,951
Have a good day, Mr Prosecutor.

1301
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:49,310
Let's get started, shall we?

1302
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:52,232
-Ready, Abidin?
-Yes, Dr Cemal.

1303
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:55,392
-Sakir, you? Shall we start?
-Sure, doctor.

1304
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:57,676
-Let's start, but...
-What?

1305
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:01,832
Well, I told the prosecutor.
You heard. But he won't listen.

1306
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:05,476
-Listen to what?
-We have such lousy equipment, doctor.

1307
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:09,315
How can you do an autopsy
with this kit, for God's sake?

1308
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:11,869
What's the problem?
We do it all the time.

1309
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:16,591
Sure, but.. You'll probably say
there's no alternative, but there is.

1310
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:18,837
-What's that?
-Look.

1311
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:21,237
The other day
we went to Kirikkale.

1312
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:25,712
That new hospital wing was opened.
The prosecutor took me along.

1313
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:29,988
The guys had built a morgue,
a truly amazing morgue.

1314
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:33,438
And I know the head physician there,
he doesn't have a clue.

1315
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:36,592
But that didn't stop them
getting first-rate equipment.

1316
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:40,673
I'm talking autopsy instruments
which fit your hand.

1317
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,998
-Don't these?
-C'mon, don't give me that.

1318
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:46,674
Now, our kit isn't bad either, but..

1319
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:50,589
For instance, they'd got
an electric version of this saw.

1320
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:53,998
The saw's electric,
but rechargeable too.

1321
02:17:54,320 --> 02:17:59,030
Two hours on charge and use it for 24
out in the wilds, wherever you want.

1322
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:05,077
I tell the prosecutor let's get the kit
and he sends me to the accountant.

1323
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:10,872
Fine, talk to the accountant, but
he's a real jerk. He's totally clueless.

1324
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:16,558
All he's worried about is
chasing skirt at the courthouse.

1325
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:19,553
-And he can't even get it up!
-Sakir!

1326
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,231
-Yes?
-Take off that sheet and let's start.

1327
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:26,879
I'm worn out. I need sleep.

1328
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:32,478
OK, but I mean, I wanted to share
my troubles with you, doctor. Because...

1329
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:35,951
-Abidin! Are you ready?
-Yes, Dr Cemal.

1330
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:39,868
Shall I cut it?

1331
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:42,237
Sure, of course.

1332
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:48,117
Now let's start with
the body examination report.

1333
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:51,554
Then we'll move on to
the conventional autopsy report. OK?

1334
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:52,994
OK, Dr Cemal.

1335
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:56,516
Get typing then.

1336
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:01,909
An external examination of the body
was then commenced.

1337
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:08,780
The body was dressed in a shirt
of orange, yellow and grey...

1338
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:13,711
...a white undershirt...

1339
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:19,438
...and dark blue,
heavy-duty work trousers.

1340
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:21,876
-Should I cut, doctor?
-Go ahead.

1341
02:19:22,520 --> 02:19:26,593
A black leather belt
was observed at the waist.

1342
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:30,474
Come on, Sakir.

1343
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,230
The trousers were removed.

1344
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:46,518
The body was determined
to be wearing no underpants.

1345
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:50,909
The old boy went around
ready for action!

1346
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:58,275
-The body measured 180 cm...
-Excuse me, sorry!

1347
02:19:58,440 --> 02:20:00,749
-... had three-four days' beard growth...
-Excuse me, Dr Cemal!

1348
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:02,751
-... a moustache...
-Dr Cemal, excuse me!

1349
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:05,514
-What?
-Should I give the clothes...

1350
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:10,716
Mrs. Toprak is out in the corridor.
Should I give her the clothes now?

1351
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:16,679
Go on then.

1352
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:19,429
-Give them to her in a bag.
-OK.

1353
02:20:19,720 --> 02:20:22,029
Get me a bag.

1354
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:26,588
Don't hang around. Open it.

1355
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:31,591
Grab the shoes.

1356
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:35,158
-Give me that one in the corner too.
-Here.

1357
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:38,028
Now move. Make yourself useful.

1358
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:09,793
The cerebrum and cerebellum
were removed.

1359
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:16,340
Extensive subarachnoid haemorrhaging,
epidural haematoma and contusion...

1360
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:24,916
...were identified on
the cerebral and cerebellar surfaces.

1361
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:31,480
The thorax was opened.

1362
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:33,517
Open it up, Sakir.

1363
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:42,152
Keep going down to the end.

1364
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:46,510
Lift off the valve.

1365
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:56,273
The sternal valve was removed.

1366
02:21:57,520 --> 02:22:01,957
Neither free fiuid
nor haemorrhagic fiuid...

1367
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:05,553
...were identified
in the thoracic cavity.

1368
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:08,239
Take the heart out.

1369
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:10,960
The heart was removed.

1370
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:13,640
-The whole thing, doctor?
-Yes.

1371
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:19,152
The cardiac valves
were found to be normal.

1372
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:22,511
The lungs were removed.

1373
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:24,711
Take them out, Sakir.

1374
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:45,074
Doctor!

1375
02:22:47,240 --> 02:22:49,913
Doctor, can you look at this?

1376
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:57,310
Doctor, there's a...

1377
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:02,549
Look, there's dirt here
in the windpipe.

1378
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:07,632
-In this lung too, actually.
-Hold on.

1379
02:23:11,480 --> 02:23:14,313
-Doctor, dirt in the lungs...
-OK, just hold on.

1380
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:23,514
Doctor, you don't suppose
they buried him alive?

1381
02:23:30,400 --> 02:23:33,870
I said, you don't think
they buried the guy alive?

1382
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:37,715
No, it's nothing like that, but..

1383
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:58,028
Yes, Dr Cemal.
What are we saying here?

1384
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:03,838
Let's say this.

1385
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:08,511
No abnormalities were encountered...

1386
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:13,276
...in the trachea, oesophagus
or soft tissue of the neck.

1387
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:20,718
The abdomen was then opened.

1388
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,918
Open it up, Sakir.

1389
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:50,192
Go on!

1390
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:10,919
Doctor, why don't you step back a bit
or you'll get stuff on you.
