1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,994
THE 400 BLOWS

2
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,991
This film is dedicated...

3
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,231
to the memory of Andre Bazin

4
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,636
Doinel! Bring me that!

5
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,590
Indeed! Go to the corner!

6
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,754
1 minute left!

7
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,789
Quiet!

8
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,160
We'll collect them in 30 seconds!

9
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,588
Quiet!

10
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Line heads, get ready!

11
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,832
I'll count to 3

12
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,429
1...

13
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,595
2...

14
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,639
3! Collect!

15
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,953
Collect in back!

16
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,712
- Gimme!
- Wait a sec!

17
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,711
- What is it?
- He won't give it!

18
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,313
No favoritism!

19
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,110
Brown-noser!

20
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,711
Is everyone's paper in?

21
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,154
You may go!

22
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,150
Sorry! Not you!

23
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,113
Recess is a reward,
not an obligation!

24
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,592
Here
suffered Antoine Doinel unfairly...

25
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,553
punished by a prof
for a pin-up clad barely

26
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,553
So it's now forsooth,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth!

27
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,518
Alright, champs,
maybe you need a ref!

28
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,114
You can train for 3 days!
No recess!

29
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,430
3 days of rest will do you good!

30
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,996
Come look! This is funny!

31
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,150
What's so interesting there?

32
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,994
Take your seats!

33
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,395
Bravo!

34
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,836
We have a new Juvenal in our class!

35
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,072
But he can't tell
an Alexandrine from a decasyllable!

36
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,154
For tomorrow you'll conjugate...

37
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,311
Doinel, sit down!

38
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,231
in all tenses of the indicative...

39
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,830
conditional and subjunctive moods...
Your notebooks!

40
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,308
I dirty the classroom walls...

41
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,119
and misuse French versification

42
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,759
The Hare...

43
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,156
Doinel, go to the janitor and...

44
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,749
get something
to remove that nonsense...

45
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,230
or else you'll lick it off!

46
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,592
Richer, who said
you could change seats?

47
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,077
In the days when the bushes...

48
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,032
the bushes...

49
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,435
were aflame with flowers...

50
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,879
bright red...

51
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,433
When already the dark tips...

52
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,479
When already...

53
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,758
the dark tips...

54
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,350
of my long ears...

55
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,678
were seen...

56
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,671
above my head...

57
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,077
In the still unripe rye...

58
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,392
I munched on...

59
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,273
the leaves...

60
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,637
Pointing to the sky

61
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,639
One day...

62
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,919
comma... weary I lay...

63
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,232
in my den...

64
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,752
with sleep-filled eyes...

65
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,557
When little Margot
found me by surprise!

66
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,155
- Right, Simonot?
- It wasn't me, sir!

67
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,514
Sure! The other guy!

68
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,110
True, she liked me...

69
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,035
very much...

70
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,114
my gentle mistress!

71
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,197
How good to me...

72
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,760
so caring... such tenderness!

73
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,757
How she held me on her lap...

74
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,878
and kissed me!

75
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,872
What fool whistled?

76
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,759
Confess or I'll punish anybody!

77
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,354
Right, Simonot?

78
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,953
I swear, sir!

79
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,429
It wasn't me!

80
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,631
And you're cowards!

81
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,359
What a class!

82
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,109
I've known morons
but at least they didn't let it show

83
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,477
They hid in their corner

84
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,358
And you?

85
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,189
Call that clean! You've made
it dirtier! Copy the poem!

86
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,628
Your parents'll pay

87
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,559
What'll France be like in 10 years?

88
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,676
- All guys rob their parents.
- Yeah but it's hard

89
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,512
Even Mauricet!

90
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,355
Mauricet!
Where'd you buy those goggles?

91
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,078
A department store

92
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,471
Did ya swipe the money
from your dad or your ma?

93
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,911
Don't tell me
ya don't go through their pockets!

94
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,152
And ya got me caught earlier!

95
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,517
Ya bastard!

96
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,911
- Your days're numbered!
- You'll get yours!

97
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,670
I'll never do it all tonight

98
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,713
That prof's a bastard

99
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,155
It's his job!

100
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,390
But before I'm drafted...

101
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,949
I'll bash his head in!

102
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,631
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls

103
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,474
- Evening, Mama!
- Good evening...

104
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,199
Where's the flour?

105
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,395
- What flour?
- You didn't buy what I wrote down!

106
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,272
- Where's the list I left you?
- I lost it

107
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,795
No wonder
you get such bad grades!

108
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,552
Get my slippers!

109
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,552
In the bedroom!

110
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,995
Under the bed!

111
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,318
I need some flour

112
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,118
Go get it at once!

113
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,874
Yes, Mama

114
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,274
They used forceps.
He came out ass first!

115
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,034
It's hereditary!
His mother was the same way

116
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,239
It means nothing! Look at my Fanny!
It was over in 10 minutes

117
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,949
But for the little one,
if I hadn't had a Caesarean...

118
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,872
we wouldn't be talkin' now!

119
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,998
And my sister... One a year!
Can you imagine?

120
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,353
They finally took out everything.
Blood all over the place!

121
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,674
In a rush, son?

122
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,876
I just got hell for some flour

123
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,272
Don't upset your mother!
She has to be handled with care

124
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,038
- What's that?
- An anti-fog spotlight

125
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,156
I'm gonna try it out Sunday

126
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,754
Look at your son!
All flour-faced!

127
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,478
I'm not in the mood!

128
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,029
I was hoping you were!

129
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,669
And my change?

130
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,515
- I need money for the cafeteria.
- Ask your dad

131
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,952
A storm's brewing!

132
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,714
- Papa, for the cafeteria...
- What?

133
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,473
I need 1,000 francs

134
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,110
Ya ask for 1,000 and hope for 500.
So ya only need 300

135
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,038
Here's 100

136
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,235
Take 500.
But your mom's supposed to pay that

137
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,719
The scissors!

138
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,916
Where are the scissors?

139
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,997
It's not funny!

140
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,517
No homework now! It's time to eat

141
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,431
Right! Each thing has its time and
place. That way, the cows're safe!

142
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,672
Is that a new pen?

143
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,198
I made a swap for it

144
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,470
You swap a lot lately!

145
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,599
What's that smell?

146
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,715
It's the fish

147
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,074
And how!

148
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,115
Ask your mom if her hot-pad is hot

149
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,515
Why?

150
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,553
For laughs!

151
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,514
You can clear the table now

152
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,435
Your cousin phoned.
His wife is expecting again

153
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,715
Her 4th in 3 years?

154
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,837
They're like rabbits. Disgusting!

155
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,399
And what about our kid
during vacation?

156
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,757
- Who're summer camps for?
- He'd have fun there

157
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,273
It's 8 months off!

158
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,909
Never too early to plan a vacation!

159
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,309
Don't pull so hard!

160
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,875
Great, huh?

161
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,314
Lions' Club...

162
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,754
What's all this?

163
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,558
Take it easy!

164
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,752
For Sunday's race...

165
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,435
shall I pick the Chevreuse Valley
or along the Oise?

166
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,158
On Sunday I rest

167
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,957
I'm going to see Huguette

168
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,957
But I'm the race organiser!

169
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,793
I'm sick of housework...

170
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,951
And dates in the afternoon!

171
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,475
I mean the edible kind!

172
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,915
What're you waiting for?
Go to bed!

173
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,752
G'night!

174
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,993
You can be so stupid!

175
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,190
If you could only take a joke...

176
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,909
Your auto races are a waste of time!

177
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,112
The garbage!
Lights out as soon as you're in bed!

178
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,279
I make contacts!
One day I'll be vice-president!

179
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,998
Hurry up! It's late!
I didn't hear the alarm

180
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,195
That I would have dirtied
the classroom walls!

181
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,630
There's no socks around these holes!

182
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,355
Buy a new pair!
The others are in the laundry

183
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,196
I gave you money for sheets
for the kid's bed

184
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,318
He prefers his sleeping bag

185
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,073
Right, honey?

186
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,590
At least I'm warm in it

187
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,392
You still here?

188
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,273
Bye, Pa! Mama!

189
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,033
Don't rush so fast!

190
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,352
We'll get locked out
and have to see the director

191
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,069
- No need to hurry!
- Why?

192
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,595
The prof said he won't let ya in

193
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,270
- He means it?
- He can't stand you

194
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,749
- Have you money?
- Yes for the canteen

195
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,831
Trust me... This way!

196
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,752
What'll we do now?

197
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,833
Follow me!

198
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,869
Put your satchel with mine

199
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,032
Antoine! He saw me!

200
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,436
- Which one's he?
- With dark hair

201
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,437
But he should be in school!

202
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,558
- You'll get it!
- She won't dare tell Dad

203
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,915
- And the guy?
- Never saw him before!

204
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,559
So you're safe!

205
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,511
I'm going to school tomorrow...

206
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,877
but I'll need an excuse.
How'll you manage?

207
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,198
I've got an old one.
I'll cut off the date

208
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,590
You can borrow it and copy it

209
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,433
But the handwriting?

210
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,158
Imitate your mother's

211
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,829
That'll be hard. It's angular

212
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,231
- Don't worry, it'll work.
- I hope so!

213
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,277
- Bye!
- Bye!

214
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,113
I ask you to please...

215
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,352
excuse...

216
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,798
my son...

217
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,949
Rene... who was ill...

218
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,074
My son Rene!

219
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,590
It smells like something burnt!

220
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,028
That's downstairs

221
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,792
Set the table just for 2

222
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,473
Why? Is Mom gone?

223
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,598
She phoned me to say
she'll be late tonight

224
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,348
Her boss needs her for the budget

225
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,277
So we'll cook
and have a man-to-man dinner

226
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,190
She mentioned
some eggs someplace

227
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,918
I know where they are

228
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,591
Did you study hard today?

229
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,478
What'd you do?

230
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,079
The hare

231
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,514
And the tortoise?

232
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,559
No, just questions about the hare

233
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,079
- Did you answer right?
- He didn't ask me

234
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,959
You've got to speak up!

235
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,151
If not, you're out of the race

236
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,318
You've got to take
the initiative in life

237
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,032
Have you thought
of your mother's birthday?

238
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,832
It's the 17th

239
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,390
I hope you'll give her something

240
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,273
You hear me?

241
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,478
I know what you think

242
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,834
She's been hard on you lately but...

243
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,720
she's a very nervous woman

244
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,110
Put yourself in her shoes!

245
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,955
She has her housework
plus an afternoon job

246
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,196
And this place is too tiny

247
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,992
But we'll move.
I got a lead on a new place

248
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,274
In an office
it's always the same story

249
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,591
Women are exploited
and can't defend themselves

250
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,353
But she loves you! Oh shit!

251
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,639
- Where'd you put my Michelin guide?
- I didn't touch it

252
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,439
You know I can't stand lying

253
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,077
I put it in its place yesterday

254
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,594
It's not me!

255
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,718
It's crazy how things disappear!

256
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,274
It's not me

257
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,718
I'll ask your mother

258
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,952
It's time for bed

259
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,997
Don't forget the garbage

260
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,152
My boss drove me home

261
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,951
Exactly! I couldn't say no to that

262
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,351
- Night work pays double.
- Wait'll ya see my pay!

263
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,829
That kind of overtime is paid cash!

264
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,759
No wonder
you need to rest on Sunday!

265
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,273
Where's my Michelin?

266
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,749
No idea! The kid might know

267
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,036
- He doesn't.
- He's a liar!

268
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,395
- Like you!
- If ya raised him right...

269
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,154
Shit! I gave him a name!
I feed him!

270
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,230
I'm sick of your complaints! Fed up!
If ya can't stand him, say so

271
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,470
We'll put him in an orphanage...

272
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,711
so I can have some peace!

273
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,234
We'll eat out
till the end of the month!

274
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,914
How? I don't have a clean shirt!

275
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,514
You could at least do the collars

276
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,399
You and your anti-foglight!
Just to show off!

277
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,192
I bought it second-hand

278
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,754
Go open the door

279
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,592
Maybe it's the gas man

280
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,831
They send a notice first

281
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,914
I'm in Antoine's class.
Is he any better?

282
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,790
Why?

283
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,959
He missed school yesterday

284
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,719
Ya hear that?

285
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,830
You don't seem surprised

286
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,436
Why should I be?
He's capable of anything

287
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,799
What'll my excuse be?

288
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,349
The bigger the lie,
the better it works

289
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,318
When Ma broke her leg,
I went back...

290
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,789
without an excuse

291
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,679
I can't make up a story like that

292
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,797
We mustn't go in together

293
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,439
Right. You go first

294
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,279
So there you are!

295
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,798
Extra homework made you sick, eh?

296
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,672
Your folks fell for it?

297
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,832
I'd like to see
what kind of excuse you have

298
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,315
- Let's have it.
- I don't have one

299
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,119
You expect to get away
with it like that?

300
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,952
It'd be too easy!

301
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,676
Sir, it's my mother

302
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,398
What about her?

303
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,913
She's just died

304
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,440
I'm sorry... I didn't know...

305
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,677
Was she ill?

306
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,074
Yes, sir

307
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,153
You could've told me.
You should confide in your teachers

308
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,155
Go join the others

309
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,869
And your excuse?

310
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,553
Never mind!

311
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,631
- 'Tis best a thorn in the wood...
...than in the ass!

312
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,549
If you'd wash your ears
you'd hear your prompter!

313
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,108
Up your'ear!

314
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,350
He's just trying to confuse me

315
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,796
- Enough! Continue...
- I'm all mixed up

316
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,553
Than in the flowers...

317
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,672
...the flowers.
'Tis best independence...

318
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,551
And incessant peril...

319
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,233
Than slavery...

320
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,515
In eternal April.
You're an eternal loafer! Sit down!

321
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,318
I knew it at home!

322
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,592
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir!

323
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,988
I'm sorry...

324
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,514
Simonot!

325
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,592
The Hare...

326
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,473
Sit down!

327
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,593
He must be punished
within the limits...

328
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,478
He's beyond all limits!

329
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,871
Only his parents
can deal with such a mistake

330
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,429
We'll settle this tonight at home!

331
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,399
What'll you do?

332
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,235
After this I can't live
with my parents any more

333
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,637
I've got to disappear

334
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,598
Mine've been through worse!

335
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,832
Yeah, but I want
to live my own life

336
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,831
I'll write them a letter

337
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,070
- Right now?
- It's best that way

338
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,673
Where'll ya sleep?

339
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,230
I don't know. I don't care

340
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,152
I've got an idea

341
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,709
Be at the Pigalle fountain
in 1 hour

342
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,995
OK

343
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,830
It's my uncle's old print shop

344
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,674
The floor collapsed
under the heavy machines

345
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,353
Will it collapse again?

346
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,996
It can't fall any lower.
You'll be warm here

347
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,597
A mattress...
This'll do for a pillow

348
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,873
It's real heavy!

349
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,510
Go for a walk till midnight

350
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,949
- Keep my satchel until tomorrow.
- OK

351
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,873
Dear Parents... I understand
the seriousness of my lie

352
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,600
Why'd he kill me instead of you?

353
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,637
A matter of preference!

354
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,836
Life between us is impossible

355
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,310
So I'm going to try my luck
in the city or elsewhere

356
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,232
I want to become a man

357
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,437
When I see you again,
we'll have a full explanation

358
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,716
I close with kisses... Antoine

359
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,509
- It's normal that he hates me?
- You're hard on him

360
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,318
He gets on my nerves!

361
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,716
- Can you help me catch him?
- Sure!

362
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,278
- Your sister?
- No, her dog got away

363
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,238
- It's a lost dog or hers?
- I don't know!

364
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,558
- May I help?
- Yes! The more, the better!

365
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,870
- What's his name?
- I've no idea

366
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,028
Forget it, kid

367
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,151
But I saw him first!

368
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,799
Understand me?

369
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,435
- Doinel!
- Yes, sir?

370
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,718
- Did things explode last night?
- No, everything was fine!

371
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,151
Parents spoil 'em rotten!

372
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,951
Chabrol, want some help?

373
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,350
The last question is even easier

374
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,796
as if you're lisping

375
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,630
I can't. Not everyone can use
their tongue like you said

376
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,157
Quiet!
S... Si... Go sit down!

377
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,309
Impudent!

378
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,032
Now you!

379
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,751
Answer me!

380
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,114
Doinel?

381
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,119
Frochot, take over until I return

382
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,554
We don't know how to handle him!

383
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,633
Madam, you don't deserve
such a rascal

384
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,835
My poor baby!

385
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,873
Where'd you spend the night?

386
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,760
- In a print shop.
- At a printer's?

387
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,958
I don't care if he's last
so long as he behaves!

388
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,394
Fine!

389
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,989
Maybe it's... glandular

390
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,356
You mustn't catch cold

391
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,711
And now to bed!

392
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,598
I'm not sleepy

393
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,674
You'll be better off in our bed

394
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,154
You know, I was your age once

395
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,953
Kids forget that!

396
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,793
I was stubborn
and wouldn't confide in my parents

397
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,070
So I wrote everything in a diary

398
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,314
Nobody's ever read it.
One day I'll show it to you

399
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,836
At your age I went on vacation
with a shepherd boy I liked but...

400
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,152
they caught us! Ma made me swear
not to see him again...

401
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,029
and never told Papa.
So I cried a lot but I obeyed her

402
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,518
We should always obey our mothers!
We can have secrets!

403
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,154
What did you mean in your letter...

404
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,596
about having a full explanation?

405
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,313
I meant about my bad behavior
and why I don't study hard

406
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,311
So, tell me...

407
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,317
I don't know how to listen...

408
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,120
so I want to quit
and earn my own living

409
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,236
That's crazy! You've no idea!

410
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,279
I so regret not going
beyond high school!

411
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,954
Your dad has only
an elementary diploma

412
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,679
It hampers him!

413
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,279
I know school
teaches lots of useless stuff

414
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,511
Algebra and science don't...

415
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,753
help many people

416
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,232
But French! You always need it
for writing letters!

417
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,270
Let's share another secret, OK?

418
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,115
On your next French essay...
if you're among...

419
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,677
the top 5,
I'll give you 1,000 francs!

420
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,230
But don't tell your father!

421
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,428
Suddenly the dying man
rose up on his fists...

422
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,115
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children

423
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,033
The hair at his nape moved.
His wrinkles quivered

424
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,918
His face brightened

425
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,233
A breath wafted his face, making it
sublime. He lifted his fist...

426
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,633
and shouted
Archimedes' famous word...

427
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,149
Eureka! I have found it!

428
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,556
Describe a major event you witnessed
and which concerned you personally

429
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,271
Eureka! I have found it!

430
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,233
The Death...

431
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,319
of My Grandfather

432
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,078
The monkey's finally laid
the new typist!

433
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,718
She's made the most of it!

434
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,714
She got herself named
executive secretary

435
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,559
She fills all the requirements!

436
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,236
Gotta be careful of her now
because of pillow talk!

437
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,828
When she was on the road, I told her
how to juggle her expense account

438
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,037
Instead of that,
she stayed in 3-star hotels!

439
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,795
Say, I still haven't found
my Michelin hotel guide

440
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,751
One of you has moved it

441
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,831
Oh, you and your Michelin!

442
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,196
I don't like mysteries

443
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,358
What's on the stove?

444
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,238
Nothing! I'm sure!

445
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,152
Put it out! Don't yell!

446
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,392
Get some water!

447
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,150
Ya blockhead!

448
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,836
What made ya
light a candle in there?

449
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,434
It was for Balzac!

450
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,832
Balzac? Ya take me for a fool?

451
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,151
- For my French essay!
- Yes, he promised me something

452
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,959
What? A bonus for fire damage?

453
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,031
Ya need more than a candle!

454
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,158
- Want my lighter?
- Don't be silly!

455
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,835
For as long as you're living here,
you'll do as I say!

456
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,230
If not, it means military academy!

457
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,597
Know what that is?
You'll find out!

458
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,512
And you'll toe the line!

459
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,710
Know what we'll do
for a change of air?

460
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,951
We'll all go to the movies tonight!

461
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,955
Fine! A great method of education!

462
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,477
- How's your French essay?
- Not bad

463
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,278
Listen, Julian... Trust us!

464
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,838
He wants to surprise us

465
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,798
- I don't like this!
- Take us to the movies?

466
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,270
- What's playing?
- Paris Is Ours

467
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,159
- If you're plotting...
- Rather not go?

468
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,199
Sure, I'll go!
I've worked hard. I deserve it!

469
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,269
But the Gaumont Theatre
doesn't like arsonists!

470
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,635
My ice cream bar was good!
I'd never had strawberry

471
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,512
They're not in season!

472
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,555
She really had... how shall I say...
she had lots of...

473
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,633
- That's all you ever notice!
- Lots of class!

474
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,915
- I liked that movie.
- Yeah, but it wasn't funny

475
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,438
Not funny? But it had depth!

476
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,512
- What?
- Depth!

477
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,713
- The movie!
- Yeah...

478
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,557
It's time for bed

479
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,358
Beddy-bye!

480
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,716
It's Satan's general and his staff!

481
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,955
Your mom's got nice legs, eh?

482
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,077
Back to our happy hearth...
but a little smoky!

483
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,435
The garbage, honey!

484
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,510
I hope I won't regret
trying to win him over

485
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,430
Doinel!

486
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,229
If your essay is first today
it's because I've decided...

487
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,517
to rank them
by starting from the bottom

488
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,275
Your search for the absolute
led you straight to a zero

489
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,789
For you who don't know Balzac...

490
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,793
it concerns A Gloomy Affair

491
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,713
Doinel has the right to take

492
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,838
the death of a relative
as his subject...

493
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,594
although we know
he easily sacrifices his dear ones

494
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,318
whenever convenient

495
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,993
I didn't copy, sir!

496
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,958
Listen to this!

497
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,670
Suddenly the dying man rose up...

498
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,877
and shot a lightning glance
at his terrified children

499
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,635
His hair stood on end
and his eyebrows arched

500
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,439
His face brightened
with a sublime look

501
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,674
He shouted Archimedes' famous
word... Eureka! I've found it!

502
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,638
Well, I found it too!

503
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,872
- You plagiarist!
- It's not true!

504
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,640
Take your essay at once
to the principal

505
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,313
Colombel, go with him

506
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,551
And stay out
till the end of the term!

507
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,674
What's with you?

508
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,840
I sat next to him.
He didn't copy it!

509
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,558
Want to be expelled?

510
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,796
That's OK

511
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,558
Such impudence!

512
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,437
- Get out!
- Expel me but don't kick me out!

513
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,715
Out!

514
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,472
That's illegal!

515
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,315
I'll show you
who makes the laws here!

516
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,672
Did you take him?

517
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,592
- He ran away.
- Ran away?

518
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,236
I slugged him and ran

519
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,909
And you?

520
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,958
He threw me out
till after Christmas

521
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,631
Now I really can't go home.

522
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,711
Dad said
he'd put me in an academy

523
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,872
- What's that?
- Something military

524
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,589
You'd have a uniform and a future

525
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,671
No thanks!

526
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,911
If only it were the Navy!

527
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,674
I'd like to see the ocean.

528
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,717
I've seen the Channel,
the Atlantic...

529
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,599
and the Mediterranean
but not the North Sea

530
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,155
Stay at my house. We'll manage!

531
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,036
Holy cow! A horse!

532
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,791
It's my dad's. A souvenir!

533
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,711
What a huge place!

534
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,358
Clean off the sofa.
You can sleep here

535
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,954
And your parents?

536
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,999
Never here! Mom drinks
and Dad is always...

537
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,549
at the races.
This place is wide open

538
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,472
We need to start a business

539
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,631
Yeah, we need money

540
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,791
But we need some to start with

541
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,552
In that case...

542
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,280
I'll use part of my inheritance

543
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,000
Quiet! Mom may be around

544
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,758
Anyone here?

545
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,839
- Hello, madam!
- Little devil!

546
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,395
- Seen your mother lately?
- Today after school

547
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,431
She makes sure
her hours never coincide with mine

548
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,591
She must be up to something

549
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,794
Where's the fruit?

550
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,272
Here!

551
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,550
Hurry up! We'll miss the news!

552
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,677
Yeah, I know, Inspector,
you'll lock me up for life

553
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,197
But drop by Duely's around 8:00

554
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,273
Ya might meet a pal
with sharp teeth

555
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,832
I'm thirsty!

556
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,272
It's already empty!

557
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,192
Come on! Play!

558
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,317
You threw a 12?

559
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,754
It's my old man!

560
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,071
Help shake the blankets!

561
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,354
That's enough!

562
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,993
What's going on? It's a smokehouse!

563
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,879
A real gambling den!

564
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,390
I'll deduct 3 cigars
from your allowance

565
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,598
Bucephalus is not for your junk!

566
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,276
He's worth a million!
A work of art!

567
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,798
I'll never give him up
until the last minute!

568
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,035
Now turn out the lights
and go to sleep!

569
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,392
- 'Night, Pa!
- Goodnight!

570
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,709
- Not bad!
- By god!

571
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,279
Great!

572
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,472
Give me your Michelin

573
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,358
A million'd be great!

574
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,233
My dad would kill me
because of that horse

575
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,789
With a million
we'll find a beach...

576
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,594
open a boat business
and no one'll bother us!

577
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,718
- Make up your mind.
- Dad's office has some

578
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,236
- Don't back down!
- We can't sell it. They're numbered

579
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,675
- We won't sell it, we'll pawn it!
- Smart!

580
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,353
Ma pawned all our stuff
