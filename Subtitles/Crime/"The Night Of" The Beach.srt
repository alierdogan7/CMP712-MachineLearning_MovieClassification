190

A river would be fine.

Okay.

So, you close to him?

231
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,732
Who, my dad?

00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,857
I gotta get home, so...

368
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:19,974
Hey.

369
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,894
Fuck!

370
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,781
- (glass breaks)
- Aah!

371
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:42,756
(clattering)

372
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:32,973
(engine starts)

373
00:29:33,008 --> 00:29:34,975
- (horn honks)
- (tires screech)

374
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:48,355
Oh...

375
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:51,952
(sirens chirp)

376
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:07,935
(police radio chatter)

377
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:11,772
Roll your window down.

378
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:12,740
Huh?

379
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:15,709
Roll the window down.

380
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:17,377
Roll it down.

381
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:23,183
So, let me ask you, in your own
words, what does "no left turn" mean?

382
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:26,220
Uh...

383
00:31:26,254 --> 00:31:27,755
I must have missed the sign, I...

384
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,623
License, registration, and insurance.

385
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,597
Come on.

386
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:37,698
Give it to him.

387
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:38,899
Over here.

388
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:45,906
How much did you drink tonight?

389
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,874
Huh?

390
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:47,908
I don't drink.

391
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:49,143
- No?
- Nothing, I don't drink.

392
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:52,079
No? 'Cause I'm getting high
just conversating with you.

393
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,680
Step out of the car.

394
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:57,918
Out.

395
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:01,755
And I got a song request.

396
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,292
How 'bout you play me, maybe,
two bars of "Little Brown Jug."

397
00:32:07,262 --> 00:32:08,729
Do I have to?

398
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:10,264
No, see that right there, that's a mistake.

399
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:13,700
I'm gonna explain this to you since
I can see you're a little confused.

400
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,702
- Yes, you may politely refuse...
- I can't...

401
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:16,904
I'm not done.

402
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:18,705
You refuse, it's a separate offense,

403
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,841
which is an automatic
arrest. Is that what you want?

404
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,676
- No.
- Officer: Hey, Cass.

405
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,347
Put your hands on the car.

406
00:32:32,987 --> 00:32:35,489
Listen, nothing comes up on this guy.

407
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:37,624
So why don't we just make
this reckless driving?

408
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,126
- It's a lot less paperwork.
- Ugh.

409
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,727
Come on, it's late.

410
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:43,564
I don't want to do reckless driving.
I feel like he's done more than that.

411
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:45,165
Come on. He's like a kid.

412
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,434
- Kids do stuff...
- (radio beeps)

413
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:49,369
65th and Central Park West.

414
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:52,472
- Radio: Copy.
- Come on, what do you say?

415
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:53,707
Yeah, copy?

416
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:56,176
Radio: Please respond, 1031 at...

417
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:57,644
You know what tonight is?

418
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,980
- Huh?
- It's your lucky night.

419
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:01,415
I can go?

420
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:03,984
Did I say that?

421
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:06,119
Break-in on 87th, we gotta go.

422
00:33:06,154 --> 00:33:08,589
What about Cheech and Chong, here,
what are we gonna do with him?

423
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,490
I don't know. Cut him loose?

424
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,560
Bring him with us?

425
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:14,461
I can't.

426
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:17,030
Is... Excuse me, is
somebody talking to you?

427
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:18,265
- What...
- Shut up.

428
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,767
I can't leave my father's cab here.

429
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:22,135
What are you talking about?

430
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,938
It's my dad's cab. I can't just
leave it. He needs it for work.

431
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:30,711
Well, call him to come get
it. Else it's gonna get towed.

432
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:31,845
- Let's go, in the back.
- Come on, let's go.

433
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,181
- There's no car for him to come get the car.
- In the back.

434
00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:36,984
That's fine, that's fine. You'll
call him from the precinct.

435
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,552
Hey, cuffs?

436
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,153
No, I don't think so.

437
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:41,822
He needs it for work,

438
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,758
- and there's no way...
- Yeah, I know. You call him, when you get to the precinct,

439
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,927
you tell him where it is, and
he'll come and get it. Let's go.

440
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,729
Watch your head. There you go. Inside.

441
00:33:57,672 --> 00:33:59,339
What street is this?

442
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:21,962
- You the gentleman that called?
- Yeah.

443
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:23,463
Okay, so what's going on?

444
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:25,532
So, I hear something, you know?

445
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:26,934
A glass breaking.

446
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:30,370
And then from my window,
I see an open door.

447
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:32,906
I see this man go through the door,

448
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:35,909
and then he comes back
out a few seconds later.

449
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:38,612
Then I see him running down the street

450
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,314
and get into a cab.

451
00:34:40,348 --> 00:34:42,015
Race?

452
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,318
Could have been light-skinned black,

453
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:46,386
uh, Latino, I really don't know.

454
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:47,988
Not Caucasian, though?

455
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,289
Could have been, sure, why not?

456
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:52,326
(talking indistinctly)

457
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:57,097
Clothes?

458
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:59,166
He wore clothes.

459
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,201
I'm sorry. Uh, dark, maybe.

460
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,936
Okay, maybe, and he took a cab.

461
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:04,304
Yeah, a cab.

462
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:07,174
Okay, sir, can you just wait
right here for us, please?

463
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,475
- Here? Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Thank you.

464
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,010
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

465
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:35,569
- Officer: What do you got?
- Cass: We got a break-in.

466
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:37,270
One eyewit, this gentleman here.

467
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:39,239
Sees male, undetermined race,

468
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,508
goes in, comes out, runs down the street,

469
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:42,909
gets into a cab.

470
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,244
Anyone inside?

471
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:45,545
Waiting on you.

472
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,680
Who's that in the car?

473
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:49,916
Cass: No one. He was with
us when we got the call.

474
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:53,320
He's not drunk, I can see that. He's
just driving like a fucking idiot.

475
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:54,921
Fine. Let's go.

476
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:02,996
Cass: Uh, sir, we're
off-shift like, two hours ago.

477
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:04,698
Can you just take him in?

478
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:06,833
Let's go inside.

479
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,235
Flashlight.

480
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:12,305
Hello?

481
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,275
NYPD! Anybody home?

482
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,686
Hello?

483
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:59,619
Excuse me sir, take a step back.

484
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:00,821
Sorry.

485
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:19,239
Hey, Teddy? Yeah, it's Jerry.

486
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:22,175
I'm at this break-in on 87th.

487
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,177
Gonna need additional units.

488
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:26,346
EMTs, Night Watch,

489
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,148
CSU, and an ME.

490
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,617
Are you puking?

491
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:31,985
Tell me you're not puking.

492
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,054
I'm gagging, I'm not puking.

493
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:36,857
For fuck's sake, you gonna do that,
you can do it in the trunk of your car.

494
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,492
This is a nice neighborhood.

495
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,360
Is this guy still here?

496
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:42,129
Cass: We're still here,
where is he gonna go?

497
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:48,702
TV: Now I'm always respectful of the
fact that this is a great predator

498
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:50,337
(phone ringing)

499
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:53,073
TV: and certainly, if it wanted
to, could take me out very easily.

500
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,374
Night Watch.

501
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:56,409
Yeah, hey, it's Sergeant Klein at the 2-1.

502
00:37:56,444 --> 00:38:01,281
We got a suspicious DOA
at 144 West 87th Street.

503
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:04,217
Inside or out?

504
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:05,852
What's suspicious about it?

505
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,288
What's suspicious about it?

506
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:13,426
Knife wounds.

507
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:16,029
Stomach...

508
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,731
Chest...

509
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:20,333
Hands...

510
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:22,736
Fatal...

511
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:27,674
So, there's no way this could
wait for the day tour, huh?

512
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:30,010
Unresponsive.

513
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,978
Yeah, no vitals at the time of arrival.

514
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:34,047
That was like, 10 minutes ago.

515
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,815
Let's say, 0220?

516
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:38,351
All right.

517
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,325
- Who's here?
- What do you mean?

518
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,826
I mean who's here?

519
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:47,694
You.

520
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,429
Everybody else is up at Harlem Hospital.

521
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:50,664
Those Agg-Assaults.

522
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,799
Are Paul Mason and Shiyanov there?

523
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:56,336
And don't give me any shit about
"life is cheap above 96th Street."

524
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,571
We're cool.

525
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,272
(sighs)

526
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:03,410
You know what?

527
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:06,046
I'll call him.

528
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,281
- Box?
- Yeah.

529
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:11,918
I was gonna say.

530
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:16,523
(phone ringing)

531
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:21,928
(groans)

532
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,534
Box.

533
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:30,437
Dennis. Danny Lang, Night Watch.

534
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:31,605
Sorry to wake you.

535
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,907
Just thought you might want to
get in on this from the jump.

536
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:35,141
Box: What do you got?

537
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:37,877
Lang: Stabbing. Female, early 20s.

538
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:41,715
144 West 87th Street. Inside.

539
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:42,816
Brownstone?

540
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,986
Yeah. It's gonna get
pretty photogenic out there.

541
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,790
(hip-hop playing)

542
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:53,221
_

543
00:40:03,938 --> 00:40:10,977
(opera playing)

544
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,289
- Where do you think you're going?
- Detective Box, son.

545
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:23,723
Sorry, boss.

546
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:28,328
Get the door before 10
more people trample through.

547
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:40,740
Who made the call?

548
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:42,976
Neighbor over there.

549
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,578
Anybody else see anything?

550
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:47,347
- Apparently not.
- Cameras?

551
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,783
There's one up the street.
We're not sure if it's working.

552
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:51,651
Pulling the film.

553
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,053
Who's that?

554
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,355
- He's ours.
- Reckless driving.

555
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,557
You picked him up and brought
him here? What the fuck for?

556
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:59,459
Well, we just pulled him
over when the call comes in...

557
00:40:59,493 --> 00:41:00,660
Well, I don't want him here.

558
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:02,796
Get a unit. Take him back to
the house or cut him loose.

559
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,066
- Uh, we'll take him, sir. We're off-duty...
- Not you. You stay.

560
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,801
Let's get the neighbor
back to the house, too.

561
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:09,502
He's famous enough out here already.

562
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:11,905
No smoking on my crime scene.

563
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:13,306
Go ahead, sir.

564
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:18,712
All right, let's go.

565
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:20,814
Where?

566
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:22,682
Just get out of the car.

567
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:46,539
Box wants you to take him to the station.

568
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:03,423
Nice-looking kid.

569
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:05,625
Yeah.

570
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,635
What'd he do?

571
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,570
- Who?
- Him.

572
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:21,074
I don't know, he's a witness, isn't he?

573
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:26,846
Hey, what'd you see?

574
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:29,849
I didn't see nothing.

575
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:32,552
Some witness he gon' make.

576
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,627
Is she dead?

577
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:43,096
I think that's safe to say.

578
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,720
- Cop a squat.
- What?

579
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,088
Sit down.

580
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:12,258
Klein: Hey, did Maldonado
really puke at the scene?

581
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:14,461
Officer: Must have been bad clams.

582
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:16,262
Klein: Were there still
a lot of guys there?

583
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:19,132
I mean, that's a mess.

584
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,400
Just stay still.

585
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:21,968
Klein: West 87th Street.

586
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,169
I mean, it's quiet.

587
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:26,206
Officer: Yeah. All right.

588
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,075
Yeah, Maldonado had us pick up this kid.

589
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,643
Cup of coffee, man?

590
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:39,644
_

591
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:42,689
Man: Knock, knock.

592
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,791
- Hey.
- Watch where you step.

593
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:03,910
(phone ringing)

594
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:07,847
Klein.

595
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:10,583
Well, I was doing all right.
Then I answered the phone.

596
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,588
How much you give me to check?

597
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:24,731
(phone ringing)

598
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:31,037
I got a Pauline Rodriguez, will that do?

599
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:39,846
Always a pleasure.

600
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,750
(shouting)

601
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:50,823
Tom, hey, weekend or ED?

602
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,425
Dustin. Blast from the past.

603
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:54,928
Dust? Where the hell am
I supposed to park him?

604
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:57,297
Take his ass to St. Luke's, please.

605
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,498
Officer: Let's get him up.

606
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:00,533
Up. Up.

607
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,001
Fuck you lookin' at?

608
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:46,379
What can you tell me
about the weapon, Harry?

609
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,414
Pretty sure it's one knife.

610
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:51,050
Approximately one and a half inch wide by,

611
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:52,518
I'm gonna say,

612
00:45:52,553 --> 00:45:53,653
five inches long.

613
00:45:53,687 --> 00:45:55,421
Till I get her on the table and probe.

614
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:56,756
Box: Serrated, or no?

615
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,025
Not sure yet. Possibly.

616
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,603
What happened?

617
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,373
What, you can't tell me nothing?

618
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:15,008
Or you don't know nothing?

619
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:21,014
Ain't that... That's where
that girl lives, right?

620
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:23,783
I mean, what happened? What'd he
do? What, he kill her or something?

621
00:46:25,586 --> 00:46:27,487
I'm just playing, I'm just playing.

622
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:29,489
But for real, what happened?

623
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:33,359
You can't give out any information?

624
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,403
Have a seat, sir.

625
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:19,505
Someone will be right with you, all right?

626
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:21,841
Hi, Sergeant.

627
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:22,975
Hey, who's this?

628
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,043
One wit.

629
00:47:24,078 --> 00:47:26,546
Sergeant told me to bring him in.

630
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,617
Klein: All right, looks good. Any problems?

631
00:47:31,652 --> 00:47:33,086
Officer: Nope.

632
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,074
Dad.

633
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,180
You all right?

634
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:03,316
Where's Naz?

635
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,284
What?

636
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:10,189
So, who's "he" in the sentence
"he kill her or something"?

637
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,692
Uh, look, man, I was just saying.

638
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:14,193
You were just saying what?

639
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:18,131
I mean, you know, some
Arab dude she was with.

640
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:20,233
Describe him.

641
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,601
You know, an Arab dude.

642
00:48:21,635 --> 00:48:23,035
No, I don't.

643
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,505
Look like he work at a deli or some shit.

644
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:27,740
Try harder.

645
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:31,511
Uh, like, little, short, skinny,

646
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:33,579
Puerto Rican-looking
motherfucker with beanie eyes.

647
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:36,849
How do you know he wasn't Puerto
Rican? Was he wearing anything Arabic?

648
00:48:36,884 --> 00:48:38,718
Nah, man, he...

649
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:40,253
He had on his regular, you know,

650
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:42,054
Friday night, go out and party shit.

651
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:43,589
I mean, I tried to warn her, too.

652
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:45,625
Yeah? How'd you go about doing that?

653
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:48,027
I just told him right to his face.

654
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:49,529
But you didn't know him.

655
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:50,930
Nope.

656
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:52,832
Never saw him before.

657
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,267
Nope, nope.

658
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:55,802
You know the girl?

659
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:58,571
I mean, not <i>per se,</i>
you know what I'm saying?

660
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,339
No, I don't.

661
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:01,974
I mean, I know her type.

662
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:03,509
What type is that?

663
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,747
You know what, this coming out wrong.

664
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:09,448
What's your name?

665
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:11,617
How about you give me
your card or something,

666
00:49:11,652 --> 00:49:13,119
and then I just bang you on this later?

667
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:14,921
My card.

668
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:19,292
If I turn you upside down, how
much weed is gonna fall out?

669
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:22,528
Oh, so that's how you do?

670
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,835
See?

671
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:30,937
No good deed goes unturned.

672
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,471
Take him in.

673
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:34,841
Let's go.

674
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,911
Fuck LeBron. He can shit MVPs
out his ass year in, year out.

675
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:41,180
He's still not gonna be able
to deliver rings like Kobe.

676
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:43,082
Nah, nigga. Kobe ain't got no heart.

677
00:49:43,116 --> 00:49:44,584
Kobe ain't got no team, man.

678
00:49:44,618 --> 00:49:46,853
- Kobe is the team!
- That's the problem.

679
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:48,654
81 points in one game, didn't he score?

680
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:49,822
- He a overachiever.
- That's some...

681
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:51,991
You got a fucking problem
you ain't passing the ball.

682
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:53,025
Nigga was triple-teamed.

683
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,794
- Look, why would he want to...
- Triple-teamed and...

684
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:56,696
- Why would he pass the ball if he...
- (phone buzzing)

685
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,332
I roll with winners, homeboy.
I don't know about you.

686
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,367
No, man, he good, he good. He great.

687
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,869
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

688
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:05,104
But LeBron James... LeBron James,

689
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:08,007
look, he got a good two
inches on Kobe heightwise,

690
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,709
and like three...

691
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:11,444
- You know... 30 pounds.
- How long was LeBron...

692
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:13,846
- How long was LeBron with them boys in Cleveland?
- Come on.

693
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:15,214
What, like six years.

694
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:18,551
What did he win for them?
What did he win for them?

695
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:23,956
(phone ringing)

696
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,598
Who the hell is this?

697
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:34,934
This is Nasir's father, Amir.

698
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,570
Mr. Khan?

699
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:38,971
Is he with you?

700
00:50:39,006 --> 00:50:40,172
Amir: No, sir.

701
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,607
Do you know where he is?

702
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:43,442
No. I haven't seen him.

703
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:47,146
No, but he said you were
going out together tonight.

704
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,350
Yeah, we were supposed to go
to a party, but I didn't go.

705
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:52,952
So, where was this party?

706
00:50:52,986 --> 00:50:54,587
(speaking Urdu)

707
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:58,224
Amir: I have no idea. I
don't have the address on me.

708
00:51:28,722 --> 00:51:31,257
Box: I don't know what you're doing here.

709
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:34,160
I have witnesses to interview, do you?

710
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,094
Go back out there.

711
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:37,596
Sarge, we got 10,000
gold shields on the scene.

712
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:40,066
- What do you need us out there for?
- It's called chain of custody.

713
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,468
Didn't you go to the
academy like the other kids?

714
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:44,603
And when you log it all, remember,

715
00:51:44,638 --> 00:51:46,439
blood stays with blood, hair with hair,

716
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,975
photos with photos.

717
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,609
Can I ask you guys something?

718
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:53,779
Who's my friend over there who's been
staring at me like Bambi last two hours?

719
00:51:53,814 --> 00:51:56,215
Maldonado: Ah, shit, he's ours.

720
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:57,850
You, sir.

721
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,654
What is he, DWI? What'd he blow?

722
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:03,456
He was supposed to get tested in the house.

723
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,790
He didn't... I mean, you didn't?

724
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:05,958
What, get the memo?

725
00:52:05,993 --> 00:52:08,194
- Who'd we tell to test?
- We told what's-his-name.

726
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:09,295
Klein:
What's-his-name.

727
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,763
What's the matter, you
guys don't like overtime?

728
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:13,399
- Who doesn't like overtime?
- You want, I'll test him right now.

729
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:14,400
Now you're gonna test him.

730
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:16,569
Test what? It's gone, if it was ever there.

731
00:52:16,603 --> 00:52:18,037
Just dodged a bullet here, kid.

732
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:20,940
Get his pedigree, search him, clear
him of warrants, and kick him free.

733
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:22,842
Put your hands on the railing for me.

734
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:25,578
Box: Be careful with
the inventory vouchers.

735
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:28,781
Klein: DCPI called, I'm like,
totally in the dark here.

736
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:31,150
- Can you help me out?
- I'll do my best, Teddy.

737
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:32,518
Uh, name?

738
00:52:32,552 --> 00:52:34,086
Nasir Khan.

739
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:35,988
Victim's name is Andrea Cornish.

740
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:37,356
Spell it.

741
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:38,824
22 years old.

742
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:40,426
N-a-s-i-r.

743
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,461
- K-h-a-n.
- Caucasian.

744
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:43,929
Found in a bedroom,

745
00:52:43,964 --> 00:52:45,464
in bed.

746
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,666
- DOB?
- Stabbing homicide.

747
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:50,603
- Um, 11/12/90.
- Suspect is a male.

748
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:53,105
Unknown age, unknown race.

749
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,607
This your current address?

750
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,542
- Yeah.
- Seen leaving at approximately 0200

751
00:52:56,576 --> 00:52:59,111
running down the block hailing a taxi.

752
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:01,313
Witness: I didn't say
that he hailed a taxi.

753
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:03,682
I said that he left in a taxi.

754
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:04,950
That's what I said.

755
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:06,786
His taxi.

756
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,056
Fine.

757
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,391
Is this what we do?
Dump our witnesses here?

758
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:14,693
Somebody escort the
gentleman to the squad room.

759
00:53:14,728 --> 00:53:16,429
Uh, Frank, do you mind?

760
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:18,564
Frank: Come with me, sir.

761
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,433
Race, what are you?

762
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,734
Uh, Pakistani.

763
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:23,335
Asian Pacific or other.

764
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,671
- Who's the other guy?
- What other guy?

765
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:27,907
I was talking to who I said bring in.

766
00:53:27,941 --> 00:53:29,075
The one reeking weed.

767
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:30,843
Maldonado: Who'd we tell?

768
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:31,844
Cass: Bell.

769
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:33,946
Nope. Brought him in.

770
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,548
Klein: How many times stabbed?

771
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:37,149
Box: I didn't count, Teddy.

772
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:39,151
- A lot.
- Maldonado: Occupation?

773
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:40,186
Student.

774
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,555
- Get it from Harry.
- Where?

775
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:45,324
Please put your hands behind your
head for me, please, lock your fingers.

776
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:46,926
- Where?
- Hudson College.

777
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,327
Turn around.

778
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:53,065
Klein: Weapon recovered?

779
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,834
Box: Not as yet.

780
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:57,169
ESU's doing a toss of the house,

781
00:53:57,204 --> 00:53:59,939
street, dumpsters, grates, drains.

782
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:03,342
What we're looking for is an
approximately five-inch-long,

783
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:06,312
one-and-a-half-inch-wide,
possibly serrated...

784
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,150
knife.

785
00:54:13,453 --> 00:54:14,920
Maldonado: Turn around.

786
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:18,991
Do not move.

787
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:20,593
You picked him up where, again?

788
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:21,961
65th and Broadway.

789
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:23,963
- No, wait, wait.
- What time?

790
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:25,197
About 0200.

791
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:26,265
I didn't do it.

792
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:27,766
Didn't do what?

793
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,470
What's your name, son?

794
00:54:33,473 --> 00:54:35,841
Nasir. You don't understand.

795
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:38,277
That's why we're gonna talk, okay?

796
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:39,512
So I will understand.

797
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,480
Just you and me.

798
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:42,715
Come over here.

799
00:54:42,749 --> 00:54:44,316
- Come on. Come on.
- Please, let go of me.

800
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:45,818
No, no!

801
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:47,019
I didn't do anything!

802
00:54:47,053 --> 00:54:49,622
- I didn't do anything!
- Put your hands behind your back!

803
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:51,090
Give me your arm!

804
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:53,325
(shouting)

805
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:57,129
Hey, hey, man,

806
00:54:57,164 --> 00:54:59,598
that's the dude I was talking
about. That's him, right there.

807
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:01,500
Yeah. Hey, that's him.

808
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:02,835
Aah!

809
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:04,236
No!

810
00:55:04,271 --> 00:55:06,438
(phone buzzing) _

811
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:09,308
Naz: Argh! No! No!

812
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:11,243
I didn't do anything!

813
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:17,416
Should we call the police?

814
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,717
No.

815
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:38,103
Bell: Remember what he said in the car?

816
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,574
"Is she dead?"

817
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:56,522
(door opens)

818
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:11,470
We didn't, uh, formally meet out there.

819
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:14,139
I'm Detective Sergeant Dennis Box.

820
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:18,444
So, Nasir.

821
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:20,613
Is that what you like to be called, or?

822
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:21,580
Naz.

823
00:56:21,615 --> 00:56:25,284
Naz. Okay. That's easy.

824
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,555
So, Naz, what happened tonight?

825
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:34,760
Did you know Andrea well, or just meet her?

826
00:56:37,097 --> 00:56:39,231
Just someone who got in your cab?

827
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,568
My dad's cab.

828
00:56:42,602 --> 00:56:44,570
Your dad's cab, all right.

829
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,474
You picked her up in the cab.

830
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:50,843
Where?

831
00:56:53,813 --> 00:56:55,347
Naz...

832
00:56:56,483 --> 00:56:58,350
I don't know. Downtown somewhere.

833
00:56:58,385 --> 00:56:59,985
I was lost. I don't know.

834
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,455
Okay. Then?

835
00:57:05,558 --> 00:57:07,526
Where did she say she wanted to go?

836
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:14,300
The beach.

837
00:57:14,334 --> 00:57:16,068
The what?

838
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:18,037
The beach.

839
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:19,438
The beach?

840
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,744
She say something, or...

841
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:28,881
do something or behave
in some way to upset you?

842
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,417
No.

843
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:32,885
She must have said something.

844
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:34,553
No.

845
00:57:34,587 --> 00:57:37,423
Naz, you said out there
I didn't understand.

846
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:38,424
And you're right, I don't.

847
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,493
That's what I'm trying to do here. I'm...

848
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:44,063
It's why I'm here.

849
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:46,398
To try to understand. To hear it from you.

850
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:48,100
I don't have to do that, by the way.

851
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:50,769
I want to.

852
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:54,573
What you need to understand is what
you say to me here is very important.

853
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:56,175
For you, not me.

854
00:57:56,209 --> 00:57:57,576
It can help you.

855
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,812
I'm trying to help you. Help me help you.

856
00:57:59,846 --> 00:58:02,715
(gasping)

857
00:58:02,749 --> 00:58:04,883
I can't breathe.

858
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:06,018
Okay.

859
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:08,253
That's okay, not uncommon. Just relax.

860
00:58:08,288 --> 00:58:09,455
No, I mean, I have asthma.

861
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:12,224
Oh. You got something
to help you with that?

862
00:58:12,258 --> 00:58:14,159
No.

863
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:15,928
You wanna go to the hospital?

864
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:19,164
I wanna go home.

865
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,034
You still on hold?

866
00:58:22,068 --> 00:58:23,569
Yes, I am.

867
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:25,738
Where is this hospital?

868
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:27,306
It's here, where do you think?

869
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,508
Didn't he say he was going into Manhattan?

870
00:58:36,983 --> 00:58:39,585
"Is she dead?"

871
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,086
What?

872
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:44,523
That's what you asked the officers
in the car that brought you here.

873
00:58:44,557 --> 00:58:46,792
"Is she dead?"

874
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:48,827
You don't remember saying that?

875
00:58:50,263 --> 00:58:53,098
They hadn't said anything
about her. Hadn't...

876
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:55,100
said it was a she or a he,

877
00:58:55,135 --> 00:58:57,302
let alone dead, nobody had.

878
00:58:59,906 --> 00:59:03,475
So, you were at her place.
Can we agree on that?

879
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,377
You have a couple drinks.

880
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:06,645
Maybe a kiss.

881
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,414
You have a couple more drinks and...

882
00:59:09,382 --> 00:59:11,917
And she's pretty, I know that. I saw her.

883
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:13,552
What'd she do, say no?

884
00:59:13,586 --> 00:59:14,720
No.

885
00:59:14,754 --> 00:59:17,122
- Fought you?
- No.

886
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:19,057
Then what happened, Naz?

887
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,296
I don't know. I fell asleep.

888
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,398
When I woke up,

889
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:28,267
and she was like that...

890
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:29,768
She was dead.

891
00:59:29,803 --> 00:59:31,770
And you, what did you do?

892
00:59:34,207 --> 00:59:36,074
I ran.

893
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:38,243
'Cause I was scared.

894
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:39,578
By what you'd done.

895
00:59:39,612 --> 00:59:41,280
No.

896
00:59:45,452 --> 00:59:48,020
What we're gonna do when we're done here,

897
00:59:48,054 --> 00:59:50,422
just so you know, is run some tests.

898
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:52,524
You know why?

899
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,460
Because you're a crime scene, Nasir.

900
00:59:54,494 --> 00:59:56,462
Just like the house,
and the cab, and Andrea.

901
00:59:56,496 --> 01:00:00,699
And it's our job to collect
everything we can from a crime scene.

902
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:03,335
And here's what we're
gonna find, if you ask me.

903
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:05,537
Her in the cab, the cab on her,

904
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:07,940
you in the house, the house on you,

905
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:09,575
you on her, her on you,

906
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:11,443
the knife on you, her on the knife.

907
01:00:11,478 --> 01:00:13,011
I didn't kill her.

908
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:15,147
You had sex with her.

909
01:00:16,683 --> 01:00:19,284
Yes. But it wasn't...

910
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,254
I didn't force her.

911
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:23,489
I didn't say you did.

912
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:26,024
She's only the second girl
I've ever slept with in my life.

913
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,793
I liked her.

914
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,731
She was nice.

915
01:00:32,765 --> 01:00:34,633
Look, I'm gonna be straight with you, Naz.

916
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:36,502
Because what I'm looking at,

917
01:00:36,536 --> 01:00:39,805
the evidence already, the
eyewitnesses are so strong...

918
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,841
you really need to start telling
me the truth for your sake.

919
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:44,910
I am.

920
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:47,546
You see that, right?

921
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:51,583
That's recording us.

922
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:53,185
And it will be used in court.

923
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:55,087
How you think that's gonna come off?

924
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:56,755
"She was nice, I liked her.

925
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:58,123
But I killed her anyway."

926
01:00:58,157 --> 01:01:00,058
I didn't. I already told you, I...

927
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:03,161
I can't remember.

928
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:06,231
I have to tell you, that's
not gonna play any better.

929
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:08,100
Judges and juries...

930
01:01:08,134 --> 01:01:10,068
they don't like "I can't remember."

931
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:12,471
They like honesty. They like remorse.

932
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:13,906
They like that a lot.

933
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,074
That counts for something to them.

934
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,510
And even more to you.

935
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:20,245
I'm talking about years.

936
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,848
Honesty and remorse can
shave a lot of years off.

937
01:01:22,882 --> 01:01:25,918
So, you may want to revise that.

938
01:01:27,387 --> 01:01:29,121
Now's the time.

939
01:01:36,262 --> 01:01:37,529
All right.

940
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:39,031
Let's go do what we have to do.

941
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:40,866
We can talk again later.

942
01:01:48,608 --> 01:01:49,975
Come on.

943
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,383
Take your clothes off.

944
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:23,508
- What's...
- Shut the fuck up and take your shirt off.

945
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:43,195
Don't look at me. Take your pants off.

946
01:03:22,735 --> 01:03:24,569
Sorry about that.

947
01:03:26,606 --> 01:03:29,808
Here. Put these on.

948
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:36,648
Thank you.

949
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,540
Hello?

950
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:04,776
How long do I have to be
in here? I got things to do.

951
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,551
No, that's okay.

952
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:16,254
Would you hang on a second, please?

953
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:19,791
- Gentlemen, how's the scene?
- It's the Battle of Gettysburg.

954
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:21,560
We'll be there all day.
Where's the birthday boy?

955
01:04:21,594 --> 01:04:23,361
- Upstairs.
- Thanks.

956
01:04:23,396 --> 01:04:26,298
Klein: Can you spell your name for me?

957
01:04:26,332 --> 01:04:27,733
Hey, yo, excuse me, miss?

958
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,434
Hey, yo, can I call my moms?

959
01:04:29,469 --> 01:04:30,769
Go, go, come on.

960
01:04:30,803 --> 01:04:33,405
All right, I'll have one of our
detectives get in touch with you.

961
01:04:33,439 --> 01:04:35,574
Man: Turn to your left.

962
01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:36,875
Turn to the other side.

963
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:38,176
Take your shirt off.

964
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:41,046
Officer: Make sure you get some
close-ups on those back scratches.

965
01:04:42,682 --> 01:04:44,082
Get a shot of that.

966
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:47,119
Put your arms up.

967
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:51,556
All right, put your hand here.

968
01:04:53,192 --> 01:04:54,559
Turn it over.

969
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:57,429
Let's get a close-up. Thank you.

970
01:04:59,532 --> 01:05:02,367
Box: I'd like to get a little
swab of the blood on your hands.

971
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:04,269
A little swipe under the nails.

972
01:05:04,303 --> 01:05:05,904
A little bit off the
scratches on your back.

973
01:05:05,938 --> 01:05:08,907
And inside your cheek. Okay if I do that?

974
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,742
I don't know. Is it?

975
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:12,344
I need your consent, Naz.

976
01:05:12,378 --> 01:05:14,713
If you don't give it, then
I have to get a court order.

977
01:05:14,747 --> 01:05:16,481
And that will take about 45 minutes.

978
01:05:16,516 --> 01:05:18,517
So, it's not a problem.

979
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:19,885
Except for you.

980
01:05:19,919 --> 01:05:21,653
Refusing looks bad to a jury.

981
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:23,255
And I really don't want you disadvantaged.

982
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:25,357
But it's up to you.

983
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:26,792
You can say no.

984
01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:30,228
I didn't do it.

985
01:05:30,263 --> 01:05:31,363
Well, there you have it.

986
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:33,031
You got nothing to fear, so,

987
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:34,432
shall we go ahead and do it then?

988
01:05:34,467 --> 01:05:36,201
Your call.

989
01:05:38,571 --> 01:05:40,472
Say the words for me, Naz.

990
01:05:40,506 --> 01:05:41,807
Yes.

991
01:05:52,718 --> 01:05:54,219
Open your mouth.

992
01:06:00,827 --> 01:06:02,494
Oh, one more thing.

993
01:06:02,528 --> 01:06:04,629
I'm gonna need a penile swab, too.

994
01:06:04,664 --> 01:06:06,965
Is it okay if we do that next?

995
01:06:08,501 --> 01:06:09,901
Yes?

996
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:12,470
Okay.

997
01:06:19,745 --> 01:06:20,912
You want me to stay?

998
01:06:22,415 --> 01:06:23,748
Will it hurt?

999
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:26,351
No.

1000
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:28,019
Stand up.

1001
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,724
Drop your pants.

1002
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,709
That's good, good.

1003
01:06:52,578 --> 01:06:54,546
Just... just relax.

1004
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:02,053
CSU: I think we're about done here?

1005
01:07:02,088 --> 01:07:04,155
CSU 2: Box wanted palms and tips, too.

1006
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,958
- I didn't hear him say that.
- Then don't do it.

1007
01:07:06,993 --> 01:07:08,960
All right, try not to shake too much.

1008
01:07:20,273 --> 01:07:22,340
I want a lawyer.

1009
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,209
CSU 2: Oh, yeah, why?

1010
01:07:24,243 --> 01:07:26,111
What do you mean, why?

1011
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:28,246
You know what kind of message that sends?

1012
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:31,049
Hey, what do we know. We're
just crime scene unit guys.

1013
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:33,652
So, why don't you wait till
the squad detectives come back,

1014
01:07:33,686 --> 01:07:35,420
and get into all that with them.

1015
01:07:35,454 --> 01:07:38,456
Seriously though, kid, look
before you leap, is what I say.

1016
01:07:38,491 --> 01:07:40,458
Okay. We're done here.

1017
01:07:42,995 --> 01:07:44,296
Wipe up.

1018
01:07:50,269 --> 01:07:51,603
Man: Here's my card.

1019
01:07:51,637 --> 01:07:54,806
250 bucks. I'll meet you there.

1020
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,308
You'll be okay.

1021
01:07:56,342 --> 01:07:58,777
Will you take a check?

1022
01:07:58,811 --> 01:08:00,545
- For you, Paul?
- Pauline.

1023
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:03,248
Pauline, I'm sorry.

1024
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:05,951
A cashier's check's okay.

1025
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:34,980
Hey, what's with Gunga Din in there?

1026
01:08:35,014 --> 01:08:37,248
- Who?
- The big-eyed kid.

1027
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:39,684
- The kid?
- Yeah, in the pen.

1028
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:41,019
Oh, him.

1029
01:08:41,053 --> 01:08:43,021
He cut a girl on 87th Street.

1030
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:45,490
Who did?

1031
01:08:45,524 --> 01:08:50,061
They're called razors, Jack,
you should invest. Experiment.

1032
01:08:50,096 --> 01:08:52,864
Worse comes to worst, it all grows back.

1033
01:09:19,825 --> 01:09:21,126
All right, my man.

1034
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,762
All we need now is the
knife and clothes and shoes.

1035
01:09:23,796 --> 01:09:26,064
I sent all that over before you got here.

1036
01:09:26,098 --> 01:09:27,232
Who did?

1037
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:28,700
Two of my unis drove it over.

1038
01:09:29,702 --> 01:09:31,403
You always break chain
of evidence like that?

1039
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:34,105
Relax. It's all there, neat and tidy.

1040
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,441
Here's a voucher.

1041
01:09:36,475 --> 01:09:38,910
- They handed it to Mathis?
- He's their dispatcher?

1042
01:09:38,944 --> 01:09:42,147
Apparently with the Battle of Gettysburg
and all, he was the only one there.

1043
01:09:42,181 --> 01:09:44,182
Hey, nobody told me you were coming here.

1044
01:09:44,216 --> 01:09:46,751
Yet here we are.

1045
01:09:46,786 --> 01:09:49,287
Klein: Thought I was doing you
guys a favor. The fuck do I know?

1046
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:51,056
Next time, wait for us.

1047
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,924
Next time, call first.

1048
01:09:57,997 --> 01:09:59,297
What are you doing?

1049
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:01,232
I'm here to see my client.

1050
01:10:01,267 --> 01:10:04,035
- You just did.
- Not him... her.

1051
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:05,403
Him.

1052
01:10:19,452 --> 01:10:22,620
Your man is here, as it were,

1053
01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:24,255
Johnny the Red.

1054
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,224
Bye now.

1055
01:10:27,793 --> 01:10:30,095
Jack: And don't lose that key!

1056
01:10:30,129 --> 01:10:32,831
25 years, the Berlin Wall comes down,

1057
01:10:32,865 --> 01:10:37,235
and this throwback's still
going on about communists.

1058
01:10:37,269 --> 01:10:40,605
So, Nazir... Nasir.

1059
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,874
Is that what I call you or...

1060
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:44,709
- Naz.
- You're a citizen, Naz?

1061
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:45,710
What... who are you?

1062
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:48,012
Your lawyer. You a U.S. citizen?

1063
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:49,447
- You're like, a public defender?
- No.

1064
01:10:49,482 --> 01:10:50,715
You're a citizen?

1065
01:10:50,749 --> 01:10:51,716
Yeah.

1066
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,351
Guess number one:

1067
01:10:53,385 --> 01:10:55,253
Pakistani by blood?

1068
01:10:55,287 --> 01:10:56,788
- Yeah, my mom.
- What is she?

1069
01:10:56,822 --> 01:10:59,390
Punjabi, Pashtun, Baluch?

1070
01:10:59,425 --> 01:11:01,126
Punjabi.

1071
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,061
- You been to Pakistan?
- No.

1072
01:11:03,095 --> 01:11:04,696
Have you?

1073
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:05,864
No.

1074
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:10,335
It's eczema.

1075
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:12,170
Dermatologist says to keep them aerated.

1076
01:11:12,204 --> 01:11:13,905
Like that's gonna cure anything.

1077
01:11:13,939 --> 01:11:16,141
I don't know, maybe it
helps. I really can't tell.

1078
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:17,709
You ever been arrested?

1079
01:11:17,743 --> 01:11:18,610
No.

1080
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:21,246
- Pissing in public, littering, anything?
- No.

1081
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,449
Well, first time for everything, right?

1082
01:11:25,584 --> 01:11:27,018
Don't worry about my feet.

1083
01:11:27,052 --> 01:11:28,386
It's not contagious.

1084
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,587
How's your politics?

1085
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:30,755
What do you mean, my politics?

1086
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:32,557
Well, not to sound like a tea-bagger,

1087
01:11:32,591 --> 01:11:34,759
but how do you feel about America?

1088
01:11:34,793 --> 01:11:37,228
Well, I'm American. I was born here.

1089
01:11:37,263 --> 01:11:40,265
Name two Yankees headed
for the Hall of Fame?

1090
01:11:40,299 --> 01:11:41,866
- Why?
- One Mississippi...

1091
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:43,101
Rivera and Jeter.

1092
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:45,036
Good.

1093
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,204
Married?

1094
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:48,039
No.

1095
01:11:48,073 --> 01:11:51,242
So, as a good Muslim boy,
you live with your parents?

1096
01:11:51,277 --> 01:11:52,243
Yeah.

1097
01:11:52,278 --> 01:11:53,478
Talk to them yet?

1098
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:54,579
They took my phone.

1099
01:11:54,613 --> 01:11:55,647
Talk to anyone?

1100
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:56,915
N... What do you mean?

1101
01:11:56,949 --> 01:11:58,750
- Here.
- Like, who?

1102
01:11:58,784 --> 01:12:01,553
It's not a tough question.
Like cops, who else is there?

1103
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,221
Uh, I talked to one.

1104
01:12:03,255 --> 01:12:04,889
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

1105
01:12:04,924 --> 01:12:07,659
Tell me he told you you had to?

1106
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,527
He didn't.

1107
01:12:09,562 --> 01:12:11,829
Tell me he didn't read you your rights?

1108
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:14,232
They did.

1109
01:12:18,704 --> 01:12:20,371
I may need you to come down again.

1110
01:12:20,406 --> 01:12:22,874
So, don't like, run off to
Europe without telling me.

1111
01:12:22,908 --> 01:12:27,212
Do I look like someone running
off to Europe anytime soon?

1112
01:12:27,246 --> 01:12:29,280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1113
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:31,783
You may go home and get some sleep now.

1114
01:12:38,724 --> 01:12:39,991
Almost done?

1115
01:12:40,025 --> 01:12:41,259
Yeah. You?

1116
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:42,727
Yeah.

1117
01:12:42,761 --> 01:12:44,896
- Let's get out of here before they...
- (door opens)

1118
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,264
Don't look up.

1119
01:12:48,634 --> 01:12:50,702
Hit print, let's go.

1120
01:12:50,736 --> 01:12:52,403
You two were first on the scene, right?

1121
01:12:52,438 --> 01:12:54,439
Yeah. Just finished the DD-5s.

1122
01:12:54,473 --> 01:12:56,207
Everything's done. We're going home.

1123
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:58,509
Upstairs.

1124
01:12:58,544 --> 01:13:01,746
Sir, we were supposed to
be off like five hours ago.

1125
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,848
- Really?
- Yeah.

1126
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:06,050
- So...
- So come upstairs.

1127
01:13:12,925 --> 01:13:14,692
This was when?

1128
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:17,161
I don't know, what time is it now, 4:00?

1129
01:13:17,196 --> 01:13:18,363
6:00.

1130
01:13:18,397 --> 01:13:20,798
6:00! What time am I getting out of here?

1131
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:24,068
Never, if you keep answering
questions with questions.

1132
01:13:27,006 --> 01:13:28,573
What was the question again?

1133
01:13:28,607 --> 01:13:30,808
What time it was when you saw them,

1134
01:13:30,843 --> 01:13:33,378
as you put it, rubbing
up against each other?

1135
01:13:33,412 --> 01:13:35,780
- (watch ticking)
- I wanna say...

1136
01:13:35,814 --> 01:13:37,615
10:00, 11:00, something like that.

1137
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,083
You were alone?

1138
01:13:40,152 --> 01:13:41,619
Yeah.

1139
01:13:41,654 --> 01:13:42,787
Doing what?

1140
01:13:42,821 --> 01:13:44,055
Just walking.

1141
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:47,358
On West 87th Street a block from the park?

1142
01:13:47,393 --> 01:13:49,627
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

1143
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:55,466
Is this her?

1144
01:13:56,969 --> 01:13:58,603
Yeah, that's her.

1145
01:14:00,372 --> 01:14:01,606
Is he on this?

1146
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,375
I just told you that was
him out there on the floor,

1147
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,844
like, hours ago. What
more do you want from me?

1148
01:14:06,879 --> 01:14:08,346
I want you to look at it,

1149
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,448
and tell me if he's on it or not.

1150
01:14:17,122 --> 01:14:20,091
This towelhead right here.

1151
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,193
Just the number, not the op-ed.

1152
01:14:22,227 --> 01:14:24,862
Four. Number four.

1153
01:14:24,897 --> 01:14:26,864
Initial it for me.

1154
01:14:35,107 --> 01:14:36,374
Thank you, Trevor.

1155
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:42,880
Okay, Naz, listen to me,

1156
01:14:42,915 --> 01:14:45,183
don't talk to anybody anymore.

1157
01:14:45,217 --> 01:14:47,318
Anyone asks you anything, how you doing,

1158
01:14:47,353 --> 01:14:48,553
isn't it a nice day?

1159
01:14:48,587 --> 01:14:49,787
You say, "Gee, I don't know.

1160
01:14:49,822 --> 01:14:52,790
Talk to my lawyer." Okay? Say it.

1161
01:14:52,825 --> 01:14:55,059
- Okay.
- No, no, say that to me.

1162
01:14:55,094 --> 01:14:56,160
I don't know...

1163
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:57,462
- I don't know.
- Talk to...

1164
01:14:57,496 --> 01:14:58,663
Talk to my lawyer.

1165
01:14:58,697 --> 01:15:01,332
Good. I've been an "I
don't know" guy all my life.

1166
01:15:01,367 --> 01:15:03,901
It's never let me down.

1167
01:15:03,936 --> 01:15:05,036
Where are you going?

1168
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:07,572
To see if I can get you
out of here. Short of that,

1169
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:09,040
get your phone call.

1170
01:15:10,676 --> 01:15:12,110
You know what they're saying I did?

1171
01:15:12,144 --> 01:15:13,911
I don't. And I don't care.

1172
01:15:13,946 --> 01:15:16,414
Until they charge you,
you didn't do anything.

1173
01:15:17,783 --> 01:15:19,283
Guard!

1174
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,591
Don't go anywhere.

1175
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:27,892
Thanks, Wayne.

1176
01:15:30,429 --> 01:15:32,163
You know what I wonder?

1177
01:15:32,197 --> 01:15:33,831
Where'd it all go wrong?

1178
01:15:33,866 --> 01:15:36,501
The cop who first built
one of these counters,

1179
01:15:36,535 --> 01:15:38,403
how tall you think he was?

1180
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:43,474
I want to take the kid out of here.

1181
01:15:43,509 --> 01:15:44,475
No shit.

1182
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:45,777
Is he being charged?

1183
01:15:45,811 --> 01:15:47,779
- Oh, yeah.
- With?

1184
01:15:47,813 --> 01:15:49,447
Possession of a weapon, for now.

1185
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:52,250
Misdemeanor desk appearance.
Let's get him to a judge.

1186
01:15:52,284 --> 01:15:55,253
Not gonna happen. They like him
for this 87th Street thing big time.

1187
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:56,554
Who's they?

1188
01:15:56,588 --> 01:15:57,622
Box.

1189
01:15:57,656 --> 01:15:59,924
The fuck's he got to do with it?

1190
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,225
What do you think?

1191
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,628
Lieberman said he cut a girl.

1192
01:16:03,662 --> 01:16:05,563
"Cut" is right.

1193
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:10,101
- She's dead?
- Uh-huh.

1194
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:13,738
And it's Box?

1195
01:16:13,772 --> 01:16:15,640
Uh-huh.

1196
01:16:15,674 --> 01:16:16,974
Fuck.

1197
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:27,852
(phone ringing)

1198
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:30,121
Naz?

1199
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:34,258
Listen, I'm at a police station.

1200
01:16:34,293 --> 01:16:36,661
And it... it's all a mistake.

1201
01:16:36,695 --> 01:16:39,564
They've arrested me. They
think I did something.

1202
01:16:44,603 --> 01:16:46,237
Murder.

1203
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:53,444
Is he hurt?
