Most of them have been recaptured.

That was their second mistake.

was the last mistake they ever made.

this cell block is really getting old.

355

and the salt is rusting the metal.

356

I took a nail clipper. I dug around
the grille in the back of the cell.

357
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,659
With some work I can dig that grille
out of there, enlarge the hole

358
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:11,123

that might lead to the roof.

and make cardboard out of them.

or a bathrobe or whatever.

Hey! 50 millimetre guns.

512
01:25:38,426 --> 01:25:43,054
I'm worried about the shakedowns.
My cardboard grille keeps slipping out.

513
01:25:44,265 --> 01:25:48,560
Put some contact cement around the
edges. That should take care of it.

514
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:57,068
How's the rafts
and the life jackets coming?

515
01:25:58,112 --> 01:26:01,740
Okay. I think they'll be done Tuesday.

516
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,328
Tuesday night we go.

517
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:30,727
- What's that for?
- I was just thinking about Doc.

518
01:26:31,062 --> 01:26:35,106
We planted those chrysanthemums
15 years ago.

519
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:38,610
They meant a lot to Doc. To me, too.

520
01:26:38,736 --> 01:26:41,571
- I had a garden once.
- What did you grow? Weeds?

521
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:42,697
(LAUGHS)

522
01:26:42,782 --> 01:26:45,575
It's against regulations, Morris,
and you know it.

523
01:26:53,584 --> 01:26:54,959
(GROANS)

524
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:01,299
Stretcher!

525
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:05,762
GUARD 1: I'll get the medics.
GUARD 2: He won't need one.

526
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:21,194
Some men are destined
never to leave Alcatraz

527
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:25,407
alive.

528
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:44,759
- Got those books that may help you.
- Thanks.

529
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:51,099
- See you later, man.
- Goodbye, boy.

530
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:13,329
So long, boy.

531
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,551
(SNAPS FINGERS)

532
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,889
Shakedown.

533
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:35,810
(TAPPING BED)

534
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,564
Move. Move, move, move.

535
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:53,620
Take a seat.

536
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:39,916
- Have you been playing this thing long?
- A couple of months.

537
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:45,463
- You any good?
- Terrible.

538
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,468
You'll get better.

539
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:01,938
Excuse me.

540
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:13,408
That's one of the benefits of Alcatraz.

541
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:16,411
Lots of time to practise.

542
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:24,711
Has Morris been doing
anything unusual recently?

543
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:28,047
Sometimes he stays up late,
talking with Butts.

544
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,883
- Split them up. Move Morris.
- Yes, sir.

545
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:36,639
I'll have to get a cell ready
and do the paperwork.

546
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,017
We could move him, say Wednesday.

547
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:43,354
- Tuesday morning.
- Yes, sir.

548
01:30:56,577 --> 01:31:01,372
I missed you, Morris. I missed you
so much, I've got a present for you.

549
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:05,543
I'll give it to you later.

550
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,379
Get your ass back here!

551
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,307
He'll kill you. Or you'll have to kill him.

552
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:24,896
Yeah, well, I'm not going to
give him the chance.

553
01:31:25,064 --> 01:31:29,233
Can you get the rafts and
the life jackets ready to go by tonight?

554
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:34,572
We'll all meet on top,
as soon as lights are out.

555
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:55,635
- Wolf. You carrying?
- Who? Me?

556
01:32:00,391 --> 01:32:01,933
Move out.

557
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:46,477
- Where are you going, Wolfie?
- I'm just going for a walk.

558
01:32:47,813 --> 01:32:49,522
Let's take that walk.

559
01:32:57,656 --> 01:33:02,994
After six months in the hole,
you could use some exercise.

560
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:13,588
- Butts!
- I'll meet you up on top.

561
01:33:18,469 --> 01:33:19,802
Let's go.

563
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,402
Yeah... You're going, too.

564

(SOBBING QUIETLY)

566
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:05,950
Butts?

567
01:35:10,914 --> 01:35:12,707
Butts, goddamn it.

01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:20,074
I can't risk tearing this gear.
What's left of it...

576
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,451
Throw me this stuff when I get over.

577
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:10,541
Watch the barbed wire.

(BLOWING)

579
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,947
Get up, Morris. It's moving day.

580
01:46:11,658 --> 01:46:14,868
I said get up, Morris. Open up 109.

581
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:20,582
Goddamn it, Morris! I said...

582
01:46:22,377 --> 01:46:23,877

(ALARM RINGING)

585
01:47:02,709 --> 01:47:05,502
Morning, Sergeant. What have you got?

586
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:10,924
Photos and a notebook of Clarence
Anglin. The bag's made from a raincoat.

587
01:47:13,386 --> 01:47:15,846
- It would appear that they drowned.
- Why?

588
01:47:16,014 --> 01:47:18,932
If that was important enough to
take along, they wouldn't have lost it.

589
01:47:19,267 --> 01:47:21,184
Maybe they lost it
to look like they drowned.

590
01:48:05,021 --> 01:48:08,899
Warden, we just got
a message from the Director.

591
01:48:09,067 --> 01:48:10,942
He wants you on
the next plane to Washington.

592
01:48:11,277 --> 01:48:16,156
- Do chrysanthemums grow here?
- Not here on Angel Island. Why?

593
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:18,283
I'm curious.

594
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:24,414
The tides were mild
and the fog light last night.

595
01:48:25,917 --> 01:48:30,337
If they left at lights out, they had
a nine-and-a-half hour head start.

596
01:48:31,923 --> 01:48:35,008
- I wonder if they made it.
- They drowned.

597
01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:39,096
Yes, sir.
