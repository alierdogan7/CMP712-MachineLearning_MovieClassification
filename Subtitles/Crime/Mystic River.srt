00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,830
We got a guy on Sydney
says he's the father.

337
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,460
Oh, shit.

338
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,170
- Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
- En route.

339
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,210
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

340
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,880
Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.

341
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,800
And he's got some guys with him.

342
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,260
- What guys?
- Crazy-looking guys.

343
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,940
- The Savage brothers.
- Just a "hi" around the neighborhood?

344
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,940
All right, I'm on my way.

345
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,400
[OFFICER] Hey, guys.
[MAN 1] That's our niece in there.

346
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,240
[MAN 2] Let us in.
[OFFICER] We're doing our job.

347
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,700
[MAN 1] Let us in.
[MAN 2] Fuck you!

348
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,580
The doughnut shop's that way!

349
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,540
- Nick, Val, ease up.
- Fucking dickhead.

350
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,750
- Enough.
- Nick.

351
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,090
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

352
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,840
- Kevin, let's go.
- And, guys?

353
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,630
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

354
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,930
- But get answers.
- You got it.

355
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,310
[WOMAN]
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

356
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,480
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

357
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,270
- Is she in there?
[SEAN] All we're doing is looking.

358
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,070
- Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
- That's my daughter's car.

359
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,320
- I understand.
- And it's got blood in it.

360
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,790
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

361
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,620
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

362
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,040
[MAN] Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, say again.

363
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,170
Sergeant Powers says you need
to get in here ASAP.

364
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,130
- Your location?
- The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.

365
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,140
All right.

366
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,310
Make sure he doesn't get through.

367
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,930
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

368
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,060
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

369
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,020
[JIMMY]
Go.

370
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,910
There's a massive search underway
for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.

371
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,740
All we know now
is there are signs of foul play...

372
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,830
...in a car found abandoned
outside of Pen Park.

373
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,330
Now, police officers have moved in
quickly and cordoned off the area...

374
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,840
...but even as we speak,
a crowd of spectators has gathered.

375
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,300
We don't know more than that,
but we will stay on the story.

376
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,850
Until later, this is Jim Smith
reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.

377
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,720
[DAVE]
Ready? Bat back.

378
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,600
All the way back.

379
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,330
I never saw anything like that before.

380
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,870
What do we got?

381
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,550
Oh, Christ.

382
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,530
[WHITEY]
Is that her?

383
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,780
Yeah.

384
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,040
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

385
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,620
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

386
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,670
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

387
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,260
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a.38.

388
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,930
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

389
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,140
"Hey, Jimmy...

390
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,310
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect."

391
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,440
[OFFICER 1] Hey.
[OFFICER 2] Hold on!

392
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,900
[OFFICER 3] Grab him. Stop that guy.
[OFFICER 4] Hey, you!

393
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,320
[VAL] I'm fucking going in there!
[OFFICER 5] Take it easy!

394
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,820
[OFFICER 6] Get his arms.
[OFFICER 7] Hold him. Come on.

395
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,320
[VAL] Let me in, you motherfuckers!
[OFFICER 8] Take it easy.

396
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:05,410
[VAL] Let me in!
[JIMMY] Is she in there?!

397
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,460
- Sean, is my daughter in there?!
- Let me in! You motherfuckers!

398
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,130
[JIMMY] Is my daughter in there?!
Is she in there?! Is she in there?!

399
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,510
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

400
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,140
Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

401
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,310
Is that my daughter in there?!

402
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,640
Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

403
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:31,360
[VAL] Get off me!
- Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

404
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,320
Is that my daughter in there?

405
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,860
No! No!

406
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,620
[Yelling]

407
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,160
Oh, no!

408
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,830
No, God!

409
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,420
Oh, God, no!

410
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,880
No one's said anything, right?

411
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,720
What do you mean?

412
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,430
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

413
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,560
Jimmy?

414
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,350
- Jimmy, please...
- Please what?

415
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,230
- Please...
- Please what, baby? Please what?

416
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,270
[Sobbing]

417
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,850
Yeah, that's her.

418
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,400
That's Katie.

419
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,990
That's my daughter.

420
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,090
Fresh-brewed.

421
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,720
So we need to work a time line.

422
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,220
It's details, little things
that make a case.

423
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,140
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

424
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,070
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

425
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,150
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

426
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,410
At the last minute,
she changed her mind.

427
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,780
See what I mean?

428
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,500
What do you mean, Jimmy?

429
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,170
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

430
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,210
- What car?
- You're losing me here.

431
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,670
[JIMMY]
If I'd gotten into that car that day...

432
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,680
...my life would have been
a different thing.

433
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,680
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

434
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,810
...she was a beautiful woman.

435
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,230
Regal.

436
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,650
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

437
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,320
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

438
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,650
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

439
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,570
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

440
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,540
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

441
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,750
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

442
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,080
And Katie never would have been born.

443
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,380
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

444
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,550
[JIMMY] See?
- Yeah.

445
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:28,680
- You ever see Dave around?
- He married my cousin Celeste.

446
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,600
[WHITEY COUGHS]

447
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,650
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

448
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,320
MRS. MARKUM:
Around 7:30.

449
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,440
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

450
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,240
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

451
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,450
She was having dinner with her friends.

452
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,920
[WHITEY] Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
- Yeah.

453
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,920
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

454
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,590
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

455
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,140
And then around 8, she left.

456
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,430
[WHITEY] Do you know who she talked to?
- No.

457
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,350
Do you mind if we have the phone
company subpoenaed for records?

458
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,770
- No, go ahead.
[WHITEY] Good.

459
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,320
You spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

460
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,570
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

461
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,780
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

462
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,200
No, she was herself,
she was happy. She...

463
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,160
[WHITEY]
She what?

464
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,460
It's nothing.

465
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,800
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

466
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,050
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

467
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,890
...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

468
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,310
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

469
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,690
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

470
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,820
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

471
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,650
[WHITEY] Okay.
- It was just a look.

472
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,030
It's information. We collect it, put it
together, see what fits. Little things.

473
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,490
You were in prison?

474
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,950
- Oh, Jesus.
[JIMMY] Here we go.

475
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,450
- Whitey.
- I'm just asking.

476
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,830
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

477
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,840
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

478
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,840
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

479
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,300
- Sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

480
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,760
Okay, Mr. Markum.

481
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,430
- Okay.
- Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

482
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,060
...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

483
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,450
There was this kid.

484
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,080
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

485
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,370
What? Remember, it's the little things.

486
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,960
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

487
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,920
- Barely knew each other.
- Could they have been dating?

488
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,880
[JIMMY] No.
- What makes you so sure?

489
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,590
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

490
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,550
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

491
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,010
No one right now, as far as we know.

492
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,270
- I mean, knew.
- I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

493
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,730
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

494
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,530
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

495
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,030
And if you think of anything...

496
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,870
...anything at all, give us a call.

497
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,170
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

498

00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,670
MRS. HARRIS:
He don't speak.

666
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,180
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

667
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,470
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

668
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:16,980
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a.m. On Sunday morning, Brendan?

669
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,060
I was asleep.

670
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,020
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

671
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,990
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

672
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,950
He came down for breakfast at 9.

673
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:36,420
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

674
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:40,750
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take a
polygraph. You think you're up for that?

675
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,970
I loved her so much.

676
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,760
I'm never gonna feel that again.

677
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,730
It doesn't happen twice.

678
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,190
Doesn't happen once most times.

679
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:01,570
Celeste.

680
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:06,740
- Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
- What are you still doing here?

681
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,910
Uh...

682
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,200
I don't know.

683
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't know, I just...

684
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,040
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

685
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,920
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

686
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,090
- Could I get one of those?
- Yeah.

687
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,720
One for the road and then home.

688
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,770
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

689
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,780
You've done enough.

690
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,280
To you and Dave for being here for this.

691
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,800
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

692
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,060
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

693
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,890
[JIMMY]
Good night.

694
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,480
[CELESTE] Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

695
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:38,040
[Phone Rings]

696
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,580
Hello?

697
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:47,380
Oh, Christ. Lauren, say something.

698
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,350
"Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?"

699
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,810
[SEAN] Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing
things made sense.

700
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,230
I'm tired of caring about
some dead girl...

701
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,150
...and there's just gonna be
another one after her.

702
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,780
Sending killers to jail is sending them
where they've been heading all their lives.

703
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,990
The dead are still dead.

704
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,960
Jesus, I...

705
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,250
...can't do this tonight.

706
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,330
I just...

707
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,170
I can't do it.

708
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,340
Bye, baby.

709
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,640
[DAVE]
Because...

710
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:45,270
...sometimes the man
wasn't a man at all.

711
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,190
He was the boy.

712
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:51,160
The boy who escaped from wolves.

713
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,830
An animal of the dusk.

714
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,990
Invisible.

715
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:59,290
Silent.

716
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,960
Living in a world...

717
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,540
...the others never saw.

718
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,920
World of fireflies.

719
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,970
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

720
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,100
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

721
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,980
[Wolf Howls]

722
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,490
I just gotta get my head right.

723
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,670
Catch a nice, long sleep.

724
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:46,130
And the boy will go back to his forest.

725
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:51,300
Back to his fireflies.

726
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:57,220
[Footsteps Approaching]

727
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,310
Is he asleep?

728
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:24,330
How's Jimmy and everybody?

729
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,130
Okay.

730
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,170
It's weird.

731
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:33,550
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

732
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,180
Dave? Dave.

733
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,390
There's still nothing in the paper.

734
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,980
About what?

735
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:52,950
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

736
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,990
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

737
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,700
Yeah.

738
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,410
Right.

739
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,340
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

740
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:10,710
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

741
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,590
That seems more important right now.

742
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,580
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

743
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:51,090
But I don't know how.

744
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,780
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

745
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,610
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

746
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,120
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

747
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,290
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

748
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,120
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

749
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:27,040
Considering the crime, maybe.

750
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,630
Dave Boyle?

751
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,260
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

752
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,970
Could be.

01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,640
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

- Clam up for no reason, huh?
- We'll see.

- Homicide. This is my partner.

[SEAN] So you got a minute?

- I was gonna walk Michael to school.

So you look good.

- I hear rents are rising.
[DAVE] Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

[SEAN] They're cutting my dad's
old house up into condos.

01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,110
We walked by there the other day.

771
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,530
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

772
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,120
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

773
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,410
"Neighborhood needs
a fucking crime wave.

774
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,750
Get property values where they belong."

- So, what's up, Sean?
- Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,980
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

- My wife.

- How's Jimmy doing?
- It's hard to tell. You know him.

01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,240
- Yeah, so the reason we came by...
- Listen, I saw her.

785
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:23,450
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

786
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,620
That's what we wanted to talk about.

787
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:29,750
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

788
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,210
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

789
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,920
- Pretty drunk, huh?
- But it was harmless.

790
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:39,130
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

791
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,890
What time did they leave?

792
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,100
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

793
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,390
- So we'll say 12:45?
- Sounds about right.

794
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,060
[SEAN] You see anything unusual
or anyone...?

795
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,900
[DAVE]
Michael.

796
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,110
[SEAN] Like what?
I don't know.

797
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,610
A guy watching the girls?

798
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,610
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

799
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:05,620
No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

800
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,160
See you later, Dad.

801
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,120
- You got your milk money?
- Uh-huh.

802
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,130
Fuck, I hated school.

Oh, uh...

01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,680
Yeah, me too, Sean.

806
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:30,350
Uh, just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

807
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,650
- Home.
- Home by 1:15, would you say?

808
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,610
- Roughly. Sure.
- All right.

809
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,360
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,990
- Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
[SEAN] All right.

01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,250
What?

813
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:56,000
[WHITEY]
What happened to him in that car?

814
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:05,180
Can you believe this?

815
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:08,350
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

816
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,310
Yeah, well...

817
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,400
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

818
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:16,480
...you're not left with a whole lot.

819
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:19,240
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

820
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,620
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

821
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,740
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

822
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:29,160
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

823
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:33,960
She turns to the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

824
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:38,000
- She says, "Hi." He shoots her.
- She slams the door into him, takes off.

825
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,840
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

826
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,640
- I don't know. Something in the street.
- Maybe.

827
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,060
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

828
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:51,520
- Hits hard enough to get a jump on him?
- Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

829
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:55,230
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

830
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second, how
did we get to Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

831
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:01,490
[WHITEY] We just got to him.
- He's a guy who was in the bar.

832
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,490
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

833
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,780
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

834
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:10,620
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

835
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:12,960
Just a little one.

836
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:22,220
I'd recommend two sets of
visiting hours, from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

837
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,550
- Sure.
- Good.

838
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:30,890
- Have you thought about flowers?
- I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

839
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,560

842
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:48,330
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

843
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,080
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

844
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,960
Where's my daughter?

845
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,500
Downstairs, in the basement.

846
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,630
I wanna see her.

847
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,350
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

848
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,850
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

849
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,850
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

850
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,360
[MAN]
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

851
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,740
The notice.

852
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,410
It should read; "Katherine Markum...

853
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,580

- Yeah.

I stuck my hand in, it started again.

864

[WHITEY] Yeah, painful.

I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

876
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,140
- Mrs. Boyle.
- Nice to meet you.

[WHITEY] What?

01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,040
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

883
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:00,000
- Me?
- What time did Dave get home Saturday?

884
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,790
- What?
- It's a little thing.

885
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,710
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

886
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,920
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

887
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,680
You think Dave killed Katie?

888
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,390
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

889
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:21,230
- I don't know.
- No. It's just that we could figure out...

890
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,980
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

891
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:28,320
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

892
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,950
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

893
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,450
- I was asleep.
- Huh?

894
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:41,790
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

895
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,290
Okay. Well, thanks.

896
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,770
Bullshit.

[SEAN]
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

898
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,270
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

899
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,150
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

900
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:05,940
Remember what you said?

901
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,950
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

902
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:16,410
- Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
- No.

903
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,160
You're 100 percent sure?

904
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:23,130
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

905
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:29,050
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

906
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,630
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

907
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,470
He said Katie told him you'd disown
her if she ever dated a Harris.

908
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,310
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

909
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,810
Why is that?

910
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,480
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

911
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:50,820
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
"Psycho Ray" Dorian.

912
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:54,990
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray."

913
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,990
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

914
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:03,670
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

915
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,840
I don't know.

916
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:09,000
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

917
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:14,340
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any daughter of mine.

918
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:19,310
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

919
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:22,020
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses...

920
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:24,350
...canvassed people
who were in the bar.

921
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,520
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned...

922
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:32,200
...before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

923
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,660
- So?
- So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

924
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:39,580
- Some people don't talk to policemen.
- With all due respect...

925
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,250
...and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

926
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,420
- How long?
- How long what?

927
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:48,210
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

I'm not standing in your way.

933

The last thing we need is Markum and
the Savages putting the fear of God...

934
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:19,950
...into the neighborhood.

in New Hampshire in 1982.

941
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:49,360
The gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

- In Buckingham.
- The Flats?

Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

944
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:59,950
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

945
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,750

A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

996
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,530
[CELESTE]
I was sitting in my car...

997
01:17:57,990 --> 01:18:01,160
...down by the channel.
You know...

998
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:03,200
...thinking about things.

999
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,410
- What'd you think about?
- Oh, you know...

1000
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:11,830
No, actually, I don't know.

1001
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:20,880
Things. You know, the day.

1002
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:25,350
About Katie being dead.

1003
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:28,770
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy,
you know...

1004
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,350
...those things.

1005
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:33,730
Those things.

1006
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,940
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

1007
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,110
Vampires.

1008
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,070
What about them?

1009
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:48,080
They're undead...

1010
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:51,330
...but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

1011
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:55,040
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like...

1012
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:57,090
...to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

1013
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,760
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

1014
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,470
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

1015
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,760
You're not making any sense.

1016
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,560
You think I killed Katie?

1017
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:12,850
- Celeste.
- What...?

1018
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:17,270
- That the sense we're making these days?
- Where'd you come up with that?

1019
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,820
You've barely looked at me since you
found out Katie was dead.

1020
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,740
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

1021
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,660
- Dave!
- What?

1022
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:29,580
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

1023
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,540
Even your friend Sean
asked about...

1024
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:33,790
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

1025
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,630
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

1026
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:42,590
- What'd you tell him?
- I said I was asleep.

1027
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:46,720
- That's good thinking, baby.
- Jesus Christ, Dave!

1028
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:49,810
- Why not tell them about the mugger?
- The mugger?

1029
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,600
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

1030
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:55,980
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

1031
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:57,820
I must have killed her, right?

1032
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:59,940
Fuck!

1033
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:05,280
[Laughing And Sniffling]

1034
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,220
Henry...

1035
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:32,350
What? Henry?

1036
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:37,110
Henry and George.

1037
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:43,030
I never told anyone that before.

1038
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:46,370
Those were their names.

1039
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:50,540
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

1040
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:56,710
At least that's what they called
themselves, but...

1041
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,420
...they were wolves, and Dave...

1042
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:06,140
...was the boy who escaped
from wolves.

1043
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:10,520
What are you talking about, Dave?

1044
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:13,430
I'm talking Henry and George.

1045
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:17,230
They took me on a four-day ride.

1046
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:23,280
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

1047
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:27,030
And, man, Celeste...

1048
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,950
...did they have their fun.

1049
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:34,290
And no one came to help old Dave then.

1050
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:41,090
Dave had to pretend to be
somebody else.

1051
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:48,720
You mean, all those years ago...

1052
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,020
...when you were a little boy?

1053
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:57,310
Dave...

1054
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,570
Dave's dead.

1055
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:05,070
I don't know who came out of that
cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

1056
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,870
You see, honey...

1057
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:09,530
Fuck!

1058
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,410
It's like vampires.

1059
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,460
Once it's in you...

1060
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,790
...it stays.

1061
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:24,210
What stays?

1062
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:34,100
Did you know there were
child prostitutes in Rome Basin?

1063
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,430
What?

1064
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,730
Fuck!

1065
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:49,990
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

1066
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,160
I'm warning you...

1067
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,830
...I can't trust my mind.

1068
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:02,210
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

1069
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,210
[Door Closes]

1070
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:13,970
Okay.

1071
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:19,560
- The gun sends us in a different direction.
- I don't see it that way.

1072
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:22,310
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

1073
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,270
These things get passed around.

1074
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,400
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

1075
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:30,490
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

1076
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:34,740
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

1077
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:39,370
They're hiding something, but Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

1078
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:43,710
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

1079
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:48,050
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper,
this guy should be in jail already.

1080
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:50,550
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

1081
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,100
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

1082
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:58,270
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

1083
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,730
Hey, he's not my friend.

1084
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:04,400
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

1085
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,620
Hey, Jimmy.

1086
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,420
You're out late.

1087
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:25,300
Yeah, you too.

1088
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,550
It's cold, huh?

1089
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,050
Yeah, I guess.

1090
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,100
You know, I...

1091
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,650
I been sitting out here...

1092
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,940
...over the last few years...

1093
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:50,950
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

1094
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:56,950
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna sit on the porch for a while."

1095
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,340
Weird thing is...

1096
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:06,300
...it seemed to bring her back.

1097
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,840
I saw her, you know.

1098
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,350
Saw who?

1099
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,680
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

1100
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:25,820
- You saw Katie Saturday night?
- Never got around to telling you.

1101
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:30,490
Did you talk to her?

1102
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,820
Just nodded hello at one point.

1103
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:37,160
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

1104
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,880
But, uh...

1105
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,630
...Jimmy...

1106
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:50,010
...she looked, um...

1107
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,840
...happy.

1108
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:13,030
Uh, I got more walking to do.
Good night.

1109
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,170
- You stole his car.
- His car was officially towed.

1110
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:32,170
[SEAN] From the front of his house.
- No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

1111
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,840
...adjacent to the parkway.

1112
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:38,560
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

1113
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:42,310
...they took it for a joy ride...
- What? Why'd you do it?

1114
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:47,400
After I left last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

1115
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:52,360
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

1116
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:55,240
- Blood?
- Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

1117
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:59,240
- How much?
- A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot.

1118
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:02,250
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

1119
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:05,170
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

1120
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:08,090
She was chased through the park
where she died.

1121
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:12,090
- It's enough to ask questions.
- Your search is gonna get tossed out.

1122
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:17,140
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

1123
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:21,430
- In the best interest of the owner.
- Get a physical search, file the report.

1124
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,100
[WHITEY]
Bingo.

1125
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:26,440
So, you wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

1126
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:29,780
- Dave's here?
- I've had him in the box for an hour.

1127
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:33,070
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

1128
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:36,120
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

1129
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:39,490
We know you didn't get that swollen
hand sticking it in the garbage disposal.

1130
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,920
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Why's your wife afraid of you?

1131
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,960
She know what really happened
to your hand?

1132
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,140
How about a Sprite or something?

1133
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:01,350
How about you tell us what really
happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

1134
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,060
You lied.

1135
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:05,770
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

1136
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:10,820
- Hey, you think this is funny?
- No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

1137
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:15,450
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

1138
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:17,200
Okay.

1139
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,370
All right.

1140
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:24,000
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

1141
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,830
- What blood?
- Let's start with the front seat.

1142
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,750
What are you looking at him for?

1143
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:35,880
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

1144
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,180
Sure.

1145
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:40,470
[DAVE]
Oh, I get it.

1146
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,930
You're the good cop.

1147
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:46,480
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

1148
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:49,860
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

1149
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:54,240
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

1150
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:59,910
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

1151
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,790
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

1152
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:09,170
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

1153
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:13,960
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

1154
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,800
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

1155
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:20,180
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

1156
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,140
Bled like hell.

1157
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,810
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

1158
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:29,560
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

1159
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:31,440
What blood type are you?

1160
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,780
B-negative.

1161
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:36,740
Yeah? That's the match we got.

1162
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,410
- Well, there you go.
- Not quite.

1163
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:42,080
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

1164
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:46,250
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

1165
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,080
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

1166
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,420
- None.
- This is not the way you wanna go.

1167
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:55,300
[WHITEY]
How will that look in court?

1168
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:59,390
You not knowing how someone else's
blood got in the trunk of your car?

1169
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:02,470
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

1170
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:04,770
What report?

1171
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:09,440
The stolen-car report. The car
wasn't in my possession last night.

1172
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:12,860
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

1173
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:15,610
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

1174
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:25,120
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

1175
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:28,920
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

1176
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,750
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

1177
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,510
- I can break him.
- He just kicked our asses!

1178
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:36,840
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly...

1179
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:39,300
- Is that the point? No.
- What is the point?

1180
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:43,470
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

1181
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:46,140
Okay. Maybe.

1182
01:30:48,650 --> 01:30:50,310
So, what do we do with Dave?

1183
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,520
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

1184
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:58,320
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

1185
01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:01,820
Or this lovely red marble here.

1186
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:04,490
Or a figural.

1187
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,250
That one.

1188
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:10,250
Very good. Nice and simple.

1189
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,340
Hey, Jimmy!

1190
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,930
Annabeth said you were here.

1191
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:29,390
We been asking around, like you said to.

1192
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1193
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:34,400
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

1194
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:36,820
And it ain't about me
missing your brains running things.

1195
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:38,030
I know.

1196
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:42,320
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

1197
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:45,040
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

1198
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:51,210
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

1199
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:54,840
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

1200
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,880
- The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
- What about Just Ray's kid?

1201
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:02,930
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

1202
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,390
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

1203
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:09,230
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

1204
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,730
- Want us to take a run at him?
- No.

1205
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:17,570
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

1206
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,860
What?

1207
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:27,700
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

1208
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,410
Tell him.

1209
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:34,090
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

1210
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:37,960
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

1211
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:40,970
I heard something else this morning too.

1212
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:45,810
- Two staties came by in uniform.
- Maybe forgot to ask him something.

1213
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:49,180
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

1214
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:52,440
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

1215
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:11,710
"Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6, 1957.

1216
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:14,500
First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983."

1217
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:19,300
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

1218
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,800
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

1219
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:26,140
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

1220
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:31,230
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned in
another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...

1221
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:33,640
...released on lack of evidence again.

1222
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:36,520
- Beginning to become known, though.
- He's getting popular.

1223
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:40,900
Ooh. "A known associate,
one Edmund Reese, fingers Raymond...

1224
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:44,660
...in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection."

1225
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,320
Comic books? You go, Ray.

1226
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:49,160
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.

1227
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:51,080
Oh, excuse me.

1228
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:55,170
"Raymond returned said literature
unharmed." Does a year solid inside.

1229
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,670
Ooh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1230
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,340
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

1231
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:01,340
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

1232
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:04,050
Mm, evidently not.

1233
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:08,560
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBI sting operation...

1234
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:13,190
...trafficking stolen goods across state
lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

1235
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:16,190
- The boy's got style.
- Got a boatload of grief too.

1236
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:21,030
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

1237
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:26,030
- Hence, the federal interstate rap.
- Hence, they got him by the balls, but...

1238
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,870
...he does no time.

1239
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:32,080
- He rolled on someone.
- Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

1240
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:36,540
- August 1989, poof, he disappears.
- One, dead, two, in Witness Protection.

1241
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:40,000
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up...

1242
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:43,760
...to murder his son's 19-year-old
girlfriend? We got nothing.

1243
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:48,550
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years
ago, during which the weapon was used.

1244
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:52,560
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

1245
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:55,600
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

1246
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,400
Let's take a look.
"Known criminal associates:

1247
01:34:58,570 --> 01:35:03,400
Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin
'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...

1248
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,240
...Anthony Waxman."

1249
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,620
Ah...

1250
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,120
And one James Markum.

1251
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:14,750
And the hits just keep on coming.

1252
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:22,090
- You looking for me?
- I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

1253
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,340
I already gotta get back.

1254
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,930
[SEAN] So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

1255
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,600
- Bunch of them.
- You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

1256
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:36,270
He stole a truckload of cigarettes from
a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

1257
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,520
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

1258
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:42,030
I think we pulled him over
in New Bedford.

1259
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:43,240
But Harris walked.

1260
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:45,740
He didn't walk, he rolled.

1261
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:50,120
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

1262
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:51,870
On who?

1263
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,660
What the fuck was the name?

1264
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:58,790
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

1265
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,750
Jimmy Markum.

1266
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:05,930
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

1267
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:08,970
So did Harris ever testify in open court?

1268
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:12,720
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with...

1269
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:16,640
...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

1270
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:19,020
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

1271
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,730
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

1272
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:26,530
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months...

1273
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,660
...after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

1274
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:31,490
What's that tell you?

1275
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,510
[CELESTE]
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

1276
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,510
- Hey, coz, how you doing?
[CELESTE] I'm good.

1277
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,350
Okay. Hey.

1278
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:54,060
[JIMMY] Hey, Celeste.
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

1279
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:58,020
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1280
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,690
Step into my office.

1281
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,330
Beautiful day, huh?

1282
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:26,510
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

1283
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:34,850
I took Michael last night...

1284
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:37,100
...and I went to a motel.

1285
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:40,560
Okay.

1286
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:43,480
I don't know, Jim.

1287
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,900
I might have left Dave for good.

1288
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:50,280
You left Dave?

1289
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:55,040
Yeah.

1290
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:57,750
Well...

1291
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:02,630
...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

1292
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,130
I'm almost afraid of him.

1293
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:13,140
Do you know something?

1294
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:19,270
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

1295
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:21,860
He saw Katie the night
she was murdered.

1296
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:25,280
Didn't tell me about it
till after the cops questioned him.

1297
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,610
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

1298
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:32,780
Is there anything else I should know?

1299
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,210
Come here.

1300
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,340
Okay.

1301
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:49,720
At 3 in the morning...

1302
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:55,470
...on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone's blood.

1303
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,310
What did he say happened?

1304
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:06,440
That he was mugged.
That he...

1305
01:39:06,610 --> 01:39:09,400
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

1306
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:10,820
That...

1307
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:13,320
That he might have killed him.

1308
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,040
But there was nothing in the paper.

1309
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:39,100
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1310
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:40,770
Celeste?

1311
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:47,650
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

1312
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,700
Okay. All right.

1313
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:56,370
Okay.

1314
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:59,200
[CELESTE]
Oh, God.

1315
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:06,920
Okay.

1316
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:11,550
[CELESTE]
Oh, my God.

1317
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:15,760
[SEAN] Tell me about your father.
[BRENDAN] What?

1318
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:19,890
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

1319
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:23,940
- I was 6 when he left us.
- So you don't remember the guy?

1320
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,270
I remember little things.

1321
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:30,780
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

1322
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,900
He...

1323
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:35,120
He what?

1324
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:40,580
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

1325
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,250
You could always hear him
coming home.

1326
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:48,670
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

1327
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,920
You remember your father having a gun?

1328
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:53,930
No.

1329
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:58,560
Well, you seem awfully sure for
somebody who was 6 when he left.

1330
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:00,850
What's up?

1331
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:03,850
- What's that?
[DETECTIVE] This is what you asked for.

1332
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:08,610
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint
analysis, the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

1333
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,440
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

1334
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:13,780
We were talking about your father's gun.

1335
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:20,160
- I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
- Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

1336
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,920
- So when was the last time you talked?
- Never.

1337
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,420
Never?

1338
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,880
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

1339
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:31,550
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

1340
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,430
Because he's not missing.

1341
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:36,470
- He sends money every month.
- Sends money?

1342
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:41,060
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

1343
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:45,270
- From where?
- Postmark says Brooklyn.

1344
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:49,480
- How do you know it's him?
- Who else would it be?

1345
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,320
[BRENDAN]
Who else would send it?

1346
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:57,570
My ma says that's the way he was.

1347
01:41:57,740 --> 01:42:00,660
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

1348
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:07,170
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

1349
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,550
You know why, kid.

1350
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:12,380
No, I don't.

1351
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,180
The gun that killed your girlfriend...

1352
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:18,220
...was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

1353
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:20,390
So...

1354
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:23,020
...you wanna tell me about it?

1355
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:28,360
My father didn't have a gun.

1356
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,530
You are fucking lying!

1357
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:38,660
Can I go now?

1358
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:42,200
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

1359
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:59,050
[VAL] Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

1360
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:01,770
Hey, Val.

1361
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,440
Nick. How you guys holding up?

1362
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:07,230
[NICK] All right.
- It's fucked up.

1363
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:11,150
Katie.

1364
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:14,400
A fucking tragedy.

1365
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:16,820
[NICK]
Yeah.

1366
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:19,700
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

1367
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,290
Yeah?

1368
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,330
Yeah. What do you say, man? Hm?

1369
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:28,290
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

1370
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:34,630
- I gotta get home after a while.
- Don't we all? Hop in.

1371
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,590
- Come on, get in.
- All right.

1372
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,930
Well, the first round's on me.

1373
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,640
Now you're talking.

1374
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,290
I think the kid is lying about the gun.

1375
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,870
Absolutely. I told you
three times already.

1376
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:13,050
- What about the father?
- I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is alive.

1377
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:14,800
Eighty grand. I mean...

1378
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,630
...who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

1379
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:23,310
[WHITEY]
Listen, go home, have a drink.

1380
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:26,930
- Let it go for a while.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1381
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,440
Hey, anything good on the 911?

1382
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,190
- I thought you listened to it.
- I thought you listened to it.

1383
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:37,320
[Phone Rings]

1384
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:40,660
[MAN] 911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

1385
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:44,040
[BOY] There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

1386
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:47,160
[MAN] What's the location of the car?
[BOY] Sydney Street.

1387
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:51,080
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.

1388
01:44:51,250 --> 01:44:54,090
[MAN] Son, what's your name?
[BOY] He wants to know her name.

1389
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:57,340
[MAN] Your name, what's your name?
[BOY] We're so fucking out of here.

1390
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:59,380
Good luck, man.

1391
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:03,680
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

1392
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:05,430
Her.

1393
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:09,520
- What?
- The kid on the tape.

1394
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:11,400
[Tape Rewinds]

1395
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:16,860
[MAN] Son, what's your name?
[BOY] He wants to know her name.

1396
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:21,160
- He said, "Her name."
- She's a dead girl, refer to her as a she.

1397
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,910
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

1398
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:27,460
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

1399
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:33,420
Play it again.

1400
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:43,220
This one time, we're going
to take down this stamp collector.

1401
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:45,680
- Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
[NICK] Here.

1402
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:49,100
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.

1403
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:52,020
[NICK]
Mm, fucking Carson.

1404
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:56,320
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own
fucking shoe if you didn't show him.

1405
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:58,900
We all wear suits
because we want to fit in.

1406
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:03,910
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old
lady gets on. She starts screaming!

1407
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,370
[Laughing]

1408
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:09,500
Now Val turns to me,
but I'm looking at Carson.

1409
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:11,670
I'm thinking, "What the fuck?"

1410
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:17,130
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

1411
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:19,050
Fucking smiley mask!

1412
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:23,010
[NICK]
Idiot!

1413
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:25,640
And you guys didn't notice till then?

1414
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:31,900
Shit like that happened all the time on
jobs. That's why Jimmy was so missed.

1415
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:34,860
He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

1416
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,440
Why do you think he went straight?

1417
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:44,620
One word, pure and simple. Katie.

1418
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,910
What about you guys?

1419
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:53,920
What? Us? Going straight?

1420
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:57,800
That's pretty fucking funny!

1421
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:06,310
We're like bats, we like night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.

1422
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:08,140
Want another shot?

1423
01:47:11,730 --> 01:47:14,360
You know, I should slow down
till we eat.

1424
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,980
Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!

1425
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:18,570
Come on, get up.

1426
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:25,830
Live a little, huh?

1427
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:50,060
[Whispers Indistinctly]

1428
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:55,110
[NICK]
Slide over, Dave.

1429
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:59,690
- Dave.
[NICK] All right, Val! Now you're talking.

1430
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:03,320
- How you doing?
- I'm a little drunk.

1431
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,870
To our children.

1432
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:14,670
[JIMMY] I always liked this bar.
- Yeah.

1433
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:18,170
Yeah, nobody bothers you.

1434
01:48:18,340 --> 01:48:21,380
The way it should be,
nobody to bother you in this life.

1435
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:25,140
No one fucking with you
or your loved ones. Right, Dave?

1436
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:27,890
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

1437
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:30,640
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.

1438
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:32,140
[NICK]
Yeah.

1439
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:34,060
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.

01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:37,230

01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:41,860
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?

1442
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:55,870
- Drink up, Dave.
- Come on.

1443
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:58,250
[JIMMY]
Thanks, Kevin.

1444
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:37,500
Remember we took Ray Harris here
that time?

1445
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:43,050
Everybody called this guy "Just Ray,"
but Val here called him "Ray Jingles."

1446
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:48,260
This guy walked around
with 10 bucks in change...

1447
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:51,350
...in case he had to make a call
to Iraq or something.

1448
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:53,470
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?

1449
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:56,810
- You all right?
- Shit. I'm gonna be sick.

1450
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:58,480
Come on. Come on, now.

1451
01:49:58,650 --> 01:50:03,650
Dave, use the back door. Huey
don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.

1452
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:28,180
Hey, Ray.

1453
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:32,930

You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?

1456
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:50,870
Come here a second.

1457
01:50:56,370 --> 01:50:57,920
Sit down.

1458
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:09,930
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

1459
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:14,020
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

1460
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:19,480
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

1461
01:51:19,650 --> 01:51:22,230
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

1462
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:25,030
- Shit, that's terrible.
- My wife had cancer at the time.

1463
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:27,700
- Yeah, I remember.
- Ray robbed me of being with her...

1464
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:29,110
...when she was dying.

1465
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:33,540
The death part you do alone, but I could
have helped her with the dying.

1466
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:35,750
Why are you telling me this?

1467
01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:40,130
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

1468
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:42,750
- We were both crying when I did it.
- Jimmy...

1469
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:44,460
[JIMMY]
He was begging.

1470
01:51:44,630 --> 01:51:47,380
You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.

1471
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:52,010
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

1472
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:55,600
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

1473
01:51:56,430 --> 01:51:57,850
Who do you hate?

1474
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:01,690
Come on, who?

1475
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:03,360
No one.

1476
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:10,450
- What is it you think I did?
- As I was holding him under the water...

1477
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:14,120
...I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry...

1478
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:16,660
...but like if a puppy shit on a rug.

1479
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,620
Who do you love?

1480
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:24,920
You love me.

01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:28,470
What about Ma?

1482
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:37,310
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

1483
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:44,440
- You think I killed Katie, don't you?
- Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

1484
01:52:44,610 --> 01:52:47,320
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

1485
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:49,490
This is the mugger story.

1486
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,820
He wasn't a mugger,
he was a child molester.

1487
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:54,200
He was having sex with
this kid in his car.

1488
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:58,160
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

1489
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:07,590
Get out of here.

1490
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:21,770

Dave, run!

1492
01:53:26,190 --> 01:53:29,900
[JIMMY] You killed a child molester.
- Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

1493
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:33,700
- The molested boy helped you.
- Oh, no. No...

1494
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:38,500
- You just said you and the boy!
- No, forget that!

1495
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:43,040
- My head gets fucked up sometimes.
- Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

1496
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:47,800
You'd rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

1497
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:51,470
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

1498
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:56,060
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

1499
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:58,430
I didn't kill Katie.

1500

any guy's body being found.

Ray Jr. And another kid, John O'Shea.

They don't know.

1589
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:02,340
They were playing with a gun,
saw a car coming...

...one of the kids lies down in the street,
car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.

O'Shea says they just meant to scare her
and the gun went off.

1592
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:16,860
But she hit him with her door, ran...

1593
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:20,940
...and they chased her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

1594

And the beating they gave her?

I think all three of us got in that car.

02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:07,170
And sometimes,
your love for her was so big...

1656
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:11,130
...it felt like your heart would explode...
- Please stop.

1657
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:15,140
I told them their daddy
loved them that much too.

1658
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:18,810
That he had four hearts,
and they were all filled up...

1659
02:08:18,980 --> 02:08:22,940
...and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry.

1660
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:29,150
And that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved.

1661
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:32,530
And that is never wrong.

1662
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:38,620
That can never be wrong,
no matter what their daddy had to do.

1663
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:43,500
And those girls fell asleep at peace.

1664
02:08:52,010 --> 02:08:56,510
[JIMMY]
You said, "Last night." You knew?

1665
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,810
Celeste called, looking for you.

1666
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:03,310
She was worried something might
happen. She told me about Dave.

1667
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:06,320
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife...

1668
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:09,650
...says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?

1669
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:13,990
[JIMMY] Why didn't you call?
- Because it's like I told the girls.

1670
02:09:14,410 --> 02:09:16,660
Their daddy's a king.

1671
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:21,080
And a king knows what to do
and does it.

1672
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:22,830
Even when it's hard.

1673
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,380
And their daddy will do whatever
he has to for those he loves.

1674
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:30,340
And that's all that matters.

1675
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:38,890
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.

1676
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:41,350
Everyone but us.

1677
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:43,690
We will never be weak.

1678
02:09:43,850 --> 02:09:46,020
And you...

1679
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:49,610
You could rule this town.

1680
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:56,030
And after, Jimmy...

1681
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:58,950
...let's take the girls down to the parade.

1682
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:01,870
Katie would have liked that.

1683
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:18,390
[Marching Band Playing]

1684
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:20,060
[Cheering]

1685
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:40,800
Michael!

1686
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:45,680
Michael! Michael!

1687
02:11:46,980 --> 02:11:51,480
Michael!
