1
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:39,536
How much?

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,765
20 cents, 5 cents added more
for bottle taken away

3
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,639
What's your name?

4
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,692
Why'd I tell you?

5
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,097
I've already known it

6
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,272
You're named...

7
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:22,871
So Lai-chun

8
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,578
Who told you that?

9
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,623
You'll see me tonight
in your dream

10
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,794
I didn't see you in
my dream last night

11
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,429
Of course,
you haven't slept at all

12
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:34,377
It's useless!
You'll see me, for sure

13
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,717
You look something special today

14
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,214
What? Nothing special

15
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,656
Nothing

16
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,454
Why do you have red ears?

17
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,892
What do you want?

18
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,494
I just want to make friends with you

19
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,192
Why should l?

20
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,668
Look at my watch!

21
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,502
Why should l?

22
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:41,711
Just one minute, OK?

23
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,127
Time's up, speak now

24
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,598
Today is...

25
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,504
16th

26
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,305
16th... April 16

27
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,011
April 16, 1960,

28
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,670
one minute before 3 pm

29
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:17,338
You are with me

30
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:20,745
Because of you,
I'll remember that one minute

31
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,254
From now on,
we're friends of one minute

32
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:29,053
This is fact, you can't deny it

33
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:30,918
Cause it's past

34
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,892
I'll come tomorrow

35
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,242
Haven't he remember
that minute for me?

36
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,178
I don't know

37
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,375
But I've memorized this guy

38
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,384
Later on, he did come everyday

39
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,882
We became friends,
started from that minute

40
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,156
...to 2 minutes

41
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,755
Later, we dated at least
an hour a day

42
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,113
How long have we known each other?

43
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:29,779
Very long... I've forgot

44
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,598
My cousin is going to
get marry soon

45
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,793
Really? Send my congratulation to her

46
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,963
She said that

47
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,973
she'd live with her husband's family

48
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,173
What's that mean?

49
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,975
I've to find some place else to live

50
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,095
I'd like to live with you

51
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:34,009
So, how should I tell my dad?

52
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,382
Tell what?

53
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:38,654
Our affair!

54
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,281
What affair?

55
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,730
Would you marry me?

56
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,707
No!

57
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,331
I'll never come back

58
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,506
Didi, be quick, come over here

59
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,778
Your mother has drunk,
she has drunk too much

60
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,086
I'm in a hurry

61
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,705
Give her a cup of tea

62
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:14,638
Are you hungry?
Do you want something to eat?

63
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,969
Who's that guy?

64
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,809
Only one pair of earring,

65
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,275
take it back if you want to

66
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,918
I don't think that it all you have stolen

67
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:33,285
I've told you many times
that I never stolen!

68
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,722
She gave it to me willingly

69
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,532
You mean she was willing
to pay for your living?

70
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,831
Do you think it's so easy to do so?

71
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:50,908
Don't beat me...

72
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,205
Then?

73
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,642
Stop beating me!

74
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:55,711
What?

75
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,607
What? Say it out...

76
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,307
Louder!

77
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:00,316
I stole it!

78
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,181
Louder!

79
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,809
It's me, I stole it...

80
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,948
I don't want you to see
my mother again

81
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:26,241
you can change now

82
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,783
Have you seen any earring?

83
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,549
No, but I can look it up for you

84
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,692
Hey, what are you doing here?

85
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,446
You like this earring?

86
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,240
For you

87
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,385
Hey!

88
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,556
Why only one?

89
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,833
I'll wait for you downstairs

90
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,942
Who's place is it?

91
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,840
My home

92
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,317
I've never promised to
go home with you

93
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,245
But you've never refused

94
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:33,498
Are you living alone?

95
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:39,668
Is the rent high?

96
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,403
$40

97
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,778
Wow, my family live in a room

98
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,884
which costs $28 only

99
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:54,155
Do you bring girls home oftenly?

100
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,924
Sometimes

101
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,735
Let's make a deal,
I'll stay a while only

102
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,676
It's stuffy

103
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,481
Are there many families
living here?

104
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,985
Why it's empty?

105
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,328
You're nosy, aren't you?

106
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,869
Where's the toilet?

107
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,240
Let's go & eat something

108
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,647
Why don't you say earlier?

109
00:15:58,222 --> 00:15:59,621
It's raining heavily

110
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,955
I'd better leave now,
take me home

111
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,558
Why did you come with me then?

112
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:12,294
I've just promised to stay a while,

113
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:13,927
who do you think I am?

114
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,168
Don't think that
I can easily go to bed with men

115
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,368
Don't think that you can
do anything

116
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,909
be sending me a pair
of poor earring

117
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,275
I'm different from those
flapperish girls!

118
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,380
Don't come over

119
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:02,118
Guess how long you can
stop breathing

120
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:40,056
Thief! Who's that?

121
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,352
It's me!

122
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:42,686
My friend

123
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:49,429
I've told you many times
that you'd not climb up

124
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,867
I don't want the lndian guard
to bother me

125
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,869
I don't know that you've a friend here,
I leave now

126
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,982
Take the stairs

127
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,618
Where I come, where I go

128
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,946
Your friend is strange,
what's he?

129
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,392
Don't be nosy!

130
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,169
Is he a thief?

131
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:45,952
What time is it?

132
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:52,589
3 am

133
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,166
I've to go home now

134
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,452
Shall we meet tomorrow?

135
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,124
May be

136
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:28,930
Well, call me

137
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,130
Do you have my phone number?

138
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,035
I'll write it down

139
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,454
Call after 1 1,

140
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,221

141
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,932
Leung Fung-ying?
Aren't you called Lulu?

142
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,240
My colleagues don't know
my Christian name

143
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,076
Keep your promise to call, OK?

144
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,869
OK

145
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:33,153
I know you won't call me

146
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,290
I will

147
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:40,531
You don't even memorize
my number!

148
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,564
It's written down, why should l
keep this in mind then?

149
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,300
How about if it lost?

150
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,176
if it is lost,

151
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,111
I may be lost too

152
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,644
Go & lost it, if you dare!

153
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,776
If you lose it,

154
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,250
I will cut your face!

155
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,256
Stop saying that to me

156
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:23,009
You're great!

157
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:25,673
Where there's an illness,
there's a cure!

158
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,179
Are you going home?

159
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,487
I'll call you a cab

160
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,635
I don't want to go home now

161
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,169
Well, stay here then

162
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,846
Go to hell!

163
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,277
Good morning

164
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:37,416
Why you still sitting here?
Why don't you go home?

165
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,490
You haven't gone home too

166
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,852
I'm not going to talk to you

167
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:45,019
Hey!

168
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:47,460
Have I ever met you before?

169
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:49,996
I don't think so

170
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:52,563
But, have you ever noticed me?

171
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,596
You know it pretty well

172
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:58,239
What's your job?

173
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:00,371
My job?

174
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,811
Turn the volume of the
radio louder please

175
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,896
Any idea? Got it?

176
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,832
Not yet

177
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:30,873
Dance once more for me OK?

178
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:32,708
Do you want to take
advantage from me?

179
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:37,414
Hey... What's your name?

180
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:39,175
Call me Mimi

181
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,106
I've heard that there was

182
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,115
a kind of bird with no legs

183
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:17,251
It could fly and fly only...

184
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:20,381
When it got tired,
it slept in the wind

185
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,391
This kind of bird
could land only once

186
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,021
That was the time it died

187
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,441
Auntie

188
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:14,010
Come here, I want to talk to you

189
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:24,786
Excuse me

190
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:30,425
Hey, who is she?

191
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,153
What do you mean?

192
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,987
What?

193
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,934
Why did you beat him?

194
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:39,661
He tried to cheat your money!

195
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,239
Who said so?

196
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,867
No one

197
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,674
If not why should he be with you?

198
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:51,108
How old is he?
And how old are you?

199
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,813
You are not young!

200
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:57,252
Right, he does it for money,

201
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:58,821
but he can make me happy

202
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,721
Have you ever made me happy
after so many years?

203
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:02,986
Have you?

204
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:04,390
Right, I never made you
happy before

205
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:06,894
Then, let's be unhappy together

206
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:08,259
What do you want?

207
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,991
You know it pretty well

208
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:16,568
I've told you many times

209
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,573
I won't tell you anymore

210
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:20,978
You want to find your
own mother, right?

211
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,011
Go and find her yourself
if you can

212
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:24,940
I've taken care of you
for so many years,

213
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:27,917
Anything I want to say,
I have said it long ago

214
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:33,018
I didn't say it before because
I don't want you to leave

215
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,116
And I won't say it now still

216
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,983
Cause I don't think it's worth to

217
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:38,824
I tell you,

218
00:26:38,963 --> 00:26:41,592
...what can I get if
you go to find her?

219
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:43,359
Nothing!

220
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:45,999
And you will forget me as well

221
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:52,073
Why are you starring at me?

222
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,671
OK, I want you to hate me

223
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,714
At least, you won't forget me

224
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,015
Come on, treat me better

225
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,686
Maybe, I will tell you some day

226
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,030
If not, never dream so

227
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:20,594
Alright, I will wait for
that moment

228
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,836
Is his mother rich?

229
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:32,309
I think so, she used to be
a prostitute before

230
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:35,407
You know York for long?

231
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:44,020
He lived in the flat up
above our garage

232
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,423
Do you know

233
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,089
what is in his mind?

234
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:52,031
I don't know

235
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:57,298
But I know what is in your mind

236
00:27:57,608 --> 00:27:59,098
What?

237
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,208
Don't fall in love with me

238
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:21,692
It's so late, what're you doing here?

239
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,957
Waiting for my friend

240
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:31,369
What's the matter?

241
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:34,272
A girl downstairs said
that she was your friend,

242
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,073
you'd better go & have a look

243
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,912
Excuse me

244
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,994
Why do you come for me?

245
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:03,463
I'd like to take back my stuffs

246
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,366
Come up then

247
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:38,731
I'd like to stay with you

248
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:40,401
What for?

249
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,845
I'm not suitable for you

250
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,979
I don't like marriage
like the others do

251
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,873
I don't mind

252
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,512
I just want to stay with you

253
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,946
Why are you so attentive to me?

254
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:30,724
You can't please me
for my whole life!

255
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,228
You won't be happy to stay with me

256
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:51,813
Have you ever loved me?

257
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,218
I don't know how many women
else I'd fall for in my life

258
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,627
I won't know whom I love
most till the end of my life

259
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,506
Wait here

260
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:20,634
I'll collect the things for you

261
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:24,813
Somebody's home?

262
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,660
Who is outside?

263
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,318
Don't be nosy!

264
00:32:41,992 --> 00:32:43,324
Take off you slippers

265
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:45,026
Why?

266
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:46,797
It belongs to someone else

267
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:50,563
It's hers? Who say so?
Any proof here?

268
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:53,395
Are you going to take it off?

269
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,096
No!

270
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,901
A woman comes up suddenly,

271
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,701
...and she claims that this is hers,
that is hers,

272
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,073
How can I know how many women
would come up later?

273
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:02,971
If one comes & says
that you are hers,

274
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,637
should I give up?

275
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:06,181
I give nothing

276
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,375
Once I step in here,
everything is mine

277
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:20,459
Why you come up?
I've told you to stay downstairs

278
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,261
I'm leaving

279
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,480
Well, sleep with the
slippers tonight

280
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:41,651
Are you care about the slippers?
OK, I'll return it to her

281
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,548
Are you satisfied?

282
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:48,787
Somehow, nothing in this
house belongs to me!

283
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,528
What am l? I'd better leave!

284
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:09,713
Don't come back once you step out

285
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,688
Do you treat all women like this?

286
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,882
I won't be as stupid as her!

287
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,666
What are you doing?

288
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,469
Why do you treat me like this?

289
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,369
Stop it, I'm hurt...

290
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,708
How come it's you again?
Why don't you go home?

291
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,818
Many trouble will be solved
after a good sleep

292
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,860
Can you lend me few dollars
for me to take a cab?

293
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,844
I've only $5, is that enough?

294
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,288
How can I pay you back?

295
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,853
Forget it

296
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,519
I'm always on duty around here

297
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:15,092
A chance may be, take it

298
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:50,793
It's you

299
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,530
I'm taking the money back to you

300
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,599
No hurry, it doesn't matter

301
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,342
Sorry about that

302
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:05,579
Thanks! Are you alright?

303
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,416
I'm leaving now,
I have to go to work

304
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,981
So late at night?
What kind of job?

305
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,257
I am working in the SCAA

306
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:18,561
There's games holding tonight,
I've to work in the box office

307
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:24,927
Then I can have free ticket
for football match

308
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,498
I like football match before,

309
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:29,367
but now, I'm busy

310
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,873
If you want to see
any game in future,

311
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,876
just come to me

312
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:39,510
Then thanks a lot

313
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,217
Bye

314
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,298
Can we chat?

315
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,244
I can't help you about
your boyfriend

316
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:44,309
I just want to chat

317
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,143
You got no friends?

318
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,673
I don't want others to know it

319
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:50,911
Then how about me?

320
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,550
If I don't...

321
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:03,865
If I don't say it out,
I'm afraid that I'd be mad

322
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,809
I thought that I would be OK

323
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,081
I always tell myself

324
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,885
Don't tell others that
you are unhappy

325
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,885
Work hard

326
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,188
Go home and sleep earlier

327
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,893
I want to go home!

328
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:41,166
But my home is in Macao

329
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:50,141
I don't know how to
kill these nights

330
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,106
I can't sleep

331
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:03,860
I don't mean to come back

332
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:06,789
I promise myself that

333
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,864
I wouldn't go back anymore

334
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,896
I'll hate myself if I go back again

335
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:17,068
I don't want to hate myself

336
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,411
Help me please

337
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:13,925
You can't be like this still

338
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:17,661
I will be OK by getting
through this night

339
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:30,237
You are cheating yourself
by saying this only

340
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,909
How did you pass last night?

341
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:35,579
If you had passed last night,

342
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,880
you wouldn't have been here

343
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,516
You should make up your mind

344
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:48,057
If you really can't live without him,

345
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:51,891
...why don't you tell him?

346
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:56,202
If not, pretend not
knowing this guy

347
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:56,829
from this very minute

348
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,237
Don't mention "this very minute"

349
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,646
I always think that a minute
can pass very fast

350
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,648
But sometimes it takes long

351
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:25,094
One day, one pointed at
his watch and told me,

352
00:43:26,903 --> 00:43:29,599
...he would remember me
forever for that very minute

353
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,440
It was very pleasant to me

354
00:43:47,123 --> 00:43:49,114
But now when I look at the watch,

355
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:52,059
...l will tell myself,

356
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,592
...l have to forget that guy

357
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,996
from that very minute

358
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,744
When I was young in Macao,
I dreamed to ride on a tram

359
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,289
Whenever my cousin returned
from Hong Kong

360
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:23,391
I would ask her when would
she take me to HK

361
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,387
Your cousin is from Hong Kong?

362
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:32,733
No, but she studied in
HK when young

363
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:35,867
She is great,

364
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,373
she got a job in an office
just after graduation

365
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,572
And her boyfriend is
smart as well

366
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:47,876
She is going to get married soon

367
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,286
Not everyone will be
in good luck

368
00:44:56,659 --> 00:45:00,391
Don't compare with others

369
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,958
I didn't think that
I was poor before

370
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,429
Till I found out that

371
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:13,603
I didn't have a new uniform every year

372
00:45:15,344 --> 00:45:17,744
But my classmates all had new ones

373
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,842
At that moment,

374
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,217
I realised that I was poor

375
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,586
What make you to be a police then?

376
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:42,132
I wanted to be a sailor

377
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,268
But my mother's health
was not so good

378
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:48,706
And there was no others at home

379
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,612
So I had to stay over to
take care of her

380
00:45:59,922 --> 00:46:02,789
Don't you think it's bored
walking around all the night?

381
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,260
I don't think so

382
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:31,681
I'm tired, I want to go
home now

383
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:35,719
If there are anyone
who can talk to,

384
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,690
...come to me

385
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:40,427
But I don't want to interfere

386
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:41,996
your working hours

387
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,492
You can phone me then

388
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:51,072
I am here around this
time everyday

389
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,869
Hey, do you have enough
money for the fare?

390
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,512
Yes, bye

391
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:16,030
I never dream that
she will call me

392
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,661
But I always stop in front of

393
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:22,463
the telephone kiosk

394
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:28,434
Maybe she has returned to Macao

395
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:34,682
Or maybe she just wants someone
to kill a night with her

396
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:39,514
No soon, my mother past away

397
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,119
Then I changed to be a sailor
