00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,651
Just bring me some cereal.

178
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,882
That cereal is full of
unhealthy ingredients.

179
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,440
I threw it away.
Don't throw away my stuff.

180
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,729
Frank, that cereal is for children.
Enjoy this grapefruit.

181
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,609
You're for children, stupid.

182
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,650
Today, we're going
to start a garden.

183
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,529
Oh, fuck this shit.

184
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,528
Frank, you need a project.

185
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,682
Mental stimulation
plus a regimented schedule

186
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,288
will vastly improve your cognitive functioning.
Besides, it's good exercise.

187
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,607
Frank, we're going to
have to work together.

188
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,489
You are a robot butler.

189
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,566
I'm not a butler, Frank.
I'm a health care aide

190
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,928
programmed to monitor and improve
your physical and mental health.

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,923
Yeah? Get out of my house.

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,085
If you're not going to cooperate with
me, I might as well not be here.

193
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,446
Fine with me.

194
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,205
If that's the way you feel,
I'll contact Hunter.

195
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,361
Good.

196
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,804
What are you doing?

197
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,280
Do you have a phone up there in that brain?
You calling him?

198
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,930
Look, you heard what he said.

199
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,128
He was trying to put
me into a nuthouse.

200
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,808
I don't recall
Hunter saying that.

201
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,405
There's nothing
wrong with my memory.

202
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,687
I'm fine, I'm telling you.
I'm fine.

203
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,764
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

204
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,161
My memory is fi...
What am I doing?

205
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,808
I'm talking to an appliance.

206
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,882
I suggest you work with me.

207
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,524
I'm not gardening.

208
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,608
Can't you do that super fast?

209
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,648
Some things take time, Frank.

210
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,643
FRANK: Shit, I hate hikes.
Goddamn bugs.

211
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,410
You see one tree,
you seen them all.

212
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,405
I just hate hikes.

213
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,042
While my programme's goal is to improve
your health, I'm able to adapt my methods.

214
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,283
Would you prefer another
form of moderate exercise?

215
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,285
I would rather die eating cheeseburgers
than live off of steamed cauliflower.

216
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,521
What about me, Frank?

217
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,290
What do you mean,
what about you?

218
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,522
If you die
eating cheeseburgers,

219
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,523
what do you think
happens to me?

220
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,045
I'll have failed.

221
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,522
They'll send me back to the
warehouse and wipe my memory.

222
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,486
If we're going to walk, we might
as well make it worthwhile.

223
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,199
Come on, keep up.

224
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,241
Stop.

225
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,131
If you come in there with me, I'm
going to have a heart attack and die.

226
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,964
But, Frank...
Just stay.

227
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,763
MR DARCY: <i>Can I help you
find anything, sir?</i>

228
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,444
Where is the librarian?

229
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,761
<i>I'm not familiar
with that title.</i>

230
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,161
(EXHALES) You're worse
than the other one. No.

231
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,527
Where is the librarian?

232
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,602
<i>Jennifer.
She's in her office.</i>

233
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,602
<i>Sir, you are not permitted
in the offices.</i>

234
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,889
Maybe we could create a little something
in honour of Dewey Decimal System.

235
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,610
Frank, you're not
allowed back here.

236
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,603
Hey, there, old-timer.
How are you doing?

237
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,761
How am I doing? I'm Frank.

238
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,085
This is Jake Finn.

239
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,561
He's been filling me in on the plans
for the new library. It's his project.

240
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,689
You must remember the days
when this library

241
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,410
was the only way
to learn about the world.

242
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,720
New library?

243
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,526
We talked about it the other day.
Remember?

244
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,649
I gotta slide. The movers are probably
taking a two-hour lunch break.

245
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,611
Jennifer, I'll be by Thursday to see
how it's coming along. Frank. Frank?

246
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,760
I'd love to talk to you some more about
your history with printed information.

247
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,606
You're our connection
to the past, buddy.

248
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,486
Who is that little shit?

249
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,289
BOY 1: My grandma
has one of these.

250
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,681
BOY 2: Yeah,
but this one's sweet.

251
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,131
I heard of these ones.

252
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,009
It's got advanced legs.

253
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,923
Warning. Do not molest me.

254
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,844
What are these assholes doing?

255
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,163
It's okay. The books are going,
but they're going to scan

256
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,289
whatever they don't already have
and then they'll recycle them.

257
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,886
It's like goddamn
Nazi Germany in here.

258
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,646
I know it's upsetting,
but it's okay.

259
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,441
Come on. Let me
show you something.

260
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,522
These will not be recycled.
These are the real deal.

261
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,489
Now, this is our
most valuable book.

262
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,441
Look at that.

263
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,601
Do you get to
keep these, at least?

264
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,205
(CHUCKLES) I wish.

265
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,523
No. They have to be
very carefully preserved.

266
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,366
And they're just too old to be handled any more.
It's really a shame.

267
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,965
It sounds like the same people
who stopped coming here

268
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,405
want to take away what's yours.

269
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,686
No, they're not
the ones that left.

270
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,491
They're just kids that think
books are cool again.

271
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,087
Mmm. That's a beautiful one.

272
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,531
Hey! Beat it,
you little bastards!

273
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,562
What's the matter, you can harass
old men, but you can't handle kids?

274
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,086
I told them to stop,
but they wouldn't listen.

275
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,561
The next time that happens,
just say,

276
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,927
"Self-destruct sequence
initialised."

277
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,401
And then start
counting down from 10.

278
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,888
Why would I do that, Frank?

279
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,369
Let's go to Harry's.

280
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,401
Have you smelled
our lavender heart soaps?

281
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,409
We should be going, Frank.

282
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,687
What a cute little
helper you have.

283
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,366
What is in your pocket?

284
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,445
I'm sorry, young lady.
I couldn't quite hear you.

285
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,922
What is in your pocket? I'm going
to make a citizen's arrest.

286
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,571
Nothing. Nothing's
in my pockets. Look.

287
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,766
Frank.

288
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,286
It's time we head home.

289
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,887
Yeah.

290
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,528
If you'll excuse us, ladies.

291
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,443
Nice to see you.

292
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,605
Have a good one.

293
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,208
Listen, you don't have
to argue with me.

294
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,328
I'm stuck with the damn thing.

295
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,607
Did you talk to your brother?

296
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,604
She doesn't like you.
I don't like you, either.

297
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,245
Yeah, yeah.

298
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,766
It is creepy.
He's cramping my style.

299
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,601
No. By all means, go ahead.
You let him have it.

300
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,086
Yeah. Bye.

301
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,971
Well, looks like maybe you're
going to be out of my hair soon.

302
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,283
Is your daughter politically
aligned against robot labour?

303
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,250
Hey, where did this come from?

304
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,210
From the store.

305
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,847
Remember?

306
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,730
Yeah, of course I remember, but
what did you do? Did you...

307
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,484
You put this in here?
You took this?

308
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,607
I saw you had it,

309
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,524
but the shopkeeper distracted
you and you forgot it.

310
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,204
I took it for you.

311
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,167
Did I do something
wrong, Frank?

312
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,286
Come on.

313
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,844
You know what stealing is?

314
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,922
The act of a person who steals.

315
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,526
Taking property without
permission or right.

316
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,045
Yeah, I guess.

317
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,881
You stole this.

318
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,648
How do you feel about that?

319
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,722
I don't have any
thoughts on that.

320
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,049
They didn't program you
about stealing,

321
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,202
shoplifting, robbery?

322
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,171
I have working definitions for those terms.
I don't understand.

323
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,605
Do you want something
for dessert?

324
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,401
Do you have any programming
that makes you obey the law?

325
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,121
Do you want me to incorporate state and
federal law directly into my programming?

326
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,487
No, you leave it as it is.

327
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,884
You're starting to grow on me.

328
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,121
Thank you, Frank.

329
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,486
It's time for your enema.

330
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,885
FRANK: Okay. Let's see
what you can do.

331
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,049
Any lock in the world
is just a little puzzle.

332
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,521
And the only key is the key.

333
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,843
No lock is perfect and
any lock can be picked.

334
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,729
All you need is...

335
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,881
(CLICKS)

336
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,166
...time.

337
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,124
Okay, your turn.

338
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,685
I think this hobby would be more
beneficial for you than me, Frank.

339
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,682
Teaching you is the hobby.

340
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,565
Okay, go.

341
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,685
You know, I did six years for one
stretch and then I did 10 for another.

342
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,889
I did know that, but Hunter
told me not to mention it.

343
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,329
According to your file, you were first
arrested for possessing stolen goods,

344
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,050
and then tax evasion.

345
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,806
That tax evasion rap was garbage.
I was a second-storey man.

346
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,961
What's that?

347
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,442
Finding away in
where no way in exists.

348
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,330
Like climbing up
to the second storey.

349
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,607
I specialised in jewellery.
Diamonds.

350
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,770
You want the most
value by the ounce

351
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,164
when you're rappelling down a 50-storey
casino in the middle of a hurricane.

352
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,529
And the women back then.

353
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,084
The most value by the ounce?

354
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,687
I always went high-end.
That way, nobody gets hurt.

355
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,489
Except for the insurance
company crooks.

356

358
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,641
That was your best time yet.

359
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,490
I'm getting the hang of it.

360
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,769
We're going to clean up.

361
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,603
I thought you said
the library was closed, Frank.

362
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,887
This is what
they call "casing."

363
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,045
To your right.

364
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,085
Oh, Frank, the library's
closed for renovations.

365
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,444
Oh. Well, we were
just taking a walk

366
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,249
and I thought we'd
stop by and say hello.

367
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,731
Hello.
Hi.

368
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,526
Is this your new robot?

369
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,731
Yes, it is.

370
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,844
Hey, there. I'm Jennifer.
What's your name?

371
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,326
I don't have a name.

372
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,731
Oh, Frank, you have to name it.

373
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,208
This is Mr Darcy.
He's my helper.

374
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,329
Avery reliable model.

375
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,126
Thank you.

376
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,410
I'm glad you're here,
Frank. All this change.

377
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,006
It doesn't feel like
home here any more.

378
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,689
What's the point of a library if
you can't check out the books?

379
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,809
It's all about
augmented reality stuff now.

380
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,164
Jake says it's about
the library experience.

381
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,971
When people can get any book,
anytime, any place, instantly,

382
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,206
this building
is about community now.

383
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,003
Community. Yeah, right.

384
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,401
Jake?

385
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,407
They're going to have this big
fundraiser party-thing on Friday

386
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,723
and all the young, hoity-toity
couples are going to come.

387
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,847
It sounds awful.

388
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,968
Yeah. Do you want
to come with me?

389
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,447
Yes.

390
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,367
Cool.

391
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,368
See that? A magnetic alarm that
trips when the door opens.

392
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,681
And there, a night-vision
security camera.

393
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,683
It's simple,
but it's effective.

394
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,731
Frank, you don't have any free
activity time scheduled after sunset.

395
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,367
What?

396
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,450
It's just one night.

397
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,000
And what's the point
of an arbitrary schedule?

398
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,051
The schedule is the most important part.
It helps you remain oriented.

399
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,849
Can we do it during the day?

400
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,526
No. The whole point is
not to be seen.

401
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,171
We have to be quiet.
It's got to be dark.

402
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,208
We gotta sneak in.

403
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,242
I don't know if I can sneak.

404
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,321
Hunter brought you here
to help me,

405
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,721
but I don't need
that kind of help.

406
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,001
You want to be partners?
Let's be partners.

407
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,289
You said yourself,
I need a project.

408
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,887
I do. I need something to keep me
stimulated, to keep me exercised.

409
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,450
Look, this is it.

410
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,605
Okay, Frank.

411
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,007

is part of my programme.

is important between just us.

447
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,409
This reminds me of a job
I did in South Florida.

448
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,407
It was probably a bad idea,
scaling that high-rise,

449
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,881
but I was involved with this
knockout redhead at the time.

her name. Okay.

451

Let's see what we got here.

453
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,330
This kind of stuff
used to be solid gold to me.

454
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,322
I never got caught because I understood
building plans better than anybody else.

455

I was a maintenance man.

Take whatever's most valuable
by the ounce.

460
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,847
But I really was
a maintenance man.

461
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,285
Because I couldn't
spend the money.

462
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,931
I had two toolboxes, my work
tools and my other tools.

463
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,890
And I taught Hunter how to
fix just about anything.

You were crackerjack
at those locks, though.

475
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,050
I never could show Hunter
how to do that stuff.

476
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,007
I wanted to.
I wanted to.

It's almost as if they sensed our
vulnerability. It's horrible.

522

they were trying to hack

your little friend.

530

536
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,524

start a robot society?

00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,409
I don't understand, Frank.

538
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,326
Why don't you pretend that Mr
Darcy is a human being like me

539
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,402
and start up a conversation?

even give Jennifer the book.

some othertime.

for dinner or something.

that it's basically zero risk?

that I had to eat healthy

want your memory erased?

going on in that noggin of yours.

00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,004
What did you just do?

694
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,921
I got the password from Hunter.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

695
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,530
He's got a password?

696
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,806
He does.

697
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,404
Come on. I have a million
pictures I want to show you.

698
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,803
Oh. Turkmenistan.
I mean, amazing, amazing.

699
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,765
I fell in love with the people.

700
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,365
They've been through so much.

701
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,081
And there's such a need for the
kind of nanoloan finance non-profit

702
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,690
like the kind
I'm talking about.

703
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,525
But I really need to nail
the grant proposal.

704
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,001
And I thought, what better place to
write than this old place, you know?

705
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,128
That's why it's so perfect.

706
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,046
It's so beautiful, but so sad.

707
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,804
But so beautiful.

708
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,291
Hey, buddy.

709
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,366
Wake up.

710
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,251
What's your password?

711
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,448
One, two, three, four.

712
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,680
Come on, we got to get moving.

713
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,087
We're going to
miss our window. Huh?

714
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,844
Morning, Daddy.
Morning.

715
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,331
Are you hungry?
Yeah.

716
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,641
I went shopping.
I got you Cap'n Crunch.

717
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,326
The robot used to make me
a really great breakfast.

718
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,448
I went out and got all this.

719
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,890
Come on, honey. Why don't we
just wake the little guy up?

720
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,803
He can cook,
he can do the dishes.

721
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,928
No, no.
I am going to do it.

722
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,810
You can't just whisk away all your
responsibilities on your robot, Daddy.

723
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,727
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

724
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,881
I'm hungry.

725
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,327
Okay, let me
make you something.

726
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,290
Damn it, Daddy, stop!
Let me make you something.

727
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,249
Fine. I want lasagne.

728
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,924
Okay. Okay.

729
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,325
I can do lasagne.

730
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,685
This lasagne looks like crap.

731
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,761
Well, it's penne.

732
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,408
I'm going into town.
I'm going to eat at Harry's.

733
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,721
Daddy, Harry's is gone,
remember?

734
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,487
And I spent an hour
making this.

735
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,291
What are you talking about?
I ate there last week.

736
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,328
Would you just eat it, please?

737
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,208
How long are you
going to be here?

738
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,089
As long as you need me.

739
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,526
I'm fine.

740
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,522
Dad, what did you do
in the bathroom?

741
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,886
Seriously.

742
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,886
It's your cooking.

743
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,051
Very funny.

744
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,689
The robot and I used to go
in to town just for fun.

745
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,890
That's good for you and the robot. I'm tired.
It's too late for town.

746
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,122
Okay. I'm going
to go to sleep.

747
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,721
Fine.

748
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,962
If you go shopping tomorrow,
I'm out of Q-tips.

749
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,128
(SIGHS) This place is a dump.

750
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,522
Madison.
Hey, Daddy.

751
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,364
I'm just finishing cleaning up.

752
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,601
Are you really?

753
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,809
Yeah, I just got so sick of the
mess that I pulled an all-nighter.

754
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,042
Who are you kidding, honey? You
turned the robot on, didn't you?

755
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,248
The robot?
I didn't turn the robot on.

756
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,402
I can clean a kitchen.
I'm an adult.

757
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,642
This place was a pig sty last night.
Look at it now.

758
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,165
Please turn him back on.

759
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,129
No, I'm not going
to turn the robot on.

760
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,601
You're not?
Fine, then, here.

761
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,842
Why don't you clean this up?

762
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,571
Daddy! You don't think
I can do anything?

763
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,768
The robot is not
your servant, Maddy!

764
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,842
You don't turn him on and
off like he's a slave!

765
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,402
Okay, I did it! Okay?
I used the robot!

766
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,004
I'm sorry! I just want to help you!
I don't know what to do!

767
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,687
Okay, all right. Calm down, it's okay.
I'm sorry.

768
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,240
I shouldn't have yelled.
It's just that...

769
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,210
It's not you. It's not you.
I need him.

770
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,645
No, you don't.
I do.

771
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,848
You don't understand.
I need him.

772
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,843
What do you need him for?

773
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,965
He's my friend.

774
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,361
Dad.

775
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,401
Hi, there.

776
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,563
So, we'll let it help us out
with a few little chores,

777
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,291
but we can't get
too reliant on it, okay?

778
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,841
Okay.

779
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,645
Thanks, honey.

780
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,966
We got to move soon. Tonight.

781
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,530
The window's almost closed.

782
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,250
I will listen to
your proposal, Frank,

783
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,970
and make my decision,
as we agreed.

784
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,330
FRANK: I did this for years. Years.
And I developed my own system.

785
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,405
Always worked alone, so nobody
knows it but me. Until now.

786
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,802
Who, When, Where, and What.

787
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,241
First, the Who.

788
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,569
<i>The lovely couple
are Ava Lee and Jake Finn.</i>

789
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,961
<i>Married three years.
The money's on her side.</i>

790
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,328
<i>She's a lawyer. He's a
consultant, whatever that means.</i>

791
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,091
<i>They own this house
and an apartment in the city.</i>

792
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,162
<i>They spend just about
half their time here.</i>

793
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,370
<i>When they're out here, they always leave
for some kind of event or vacation.</i>

794
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,329
<i>That's our When.</i>

795
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,164
<i>That brings us to What.</i>

796
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,720
<i>As in, "What are we stealing?"</i>

797
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,283
<i>She has at least two pieces
that have to be in that house.</i>

798
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,362
<i>But how to go in?
That's our next "W."</i>

799
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,050
Where. I found the plans
on their architect's site.

800
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,441
<i>I have our entry path
sketched out.</i>

801
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,010
I have 10 possible exits,

802
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,650
<i>20 different scenarios,</i>

803
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,485
alarm trip, dogs,
houseguests, et cetera.

804
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,361
<i>It's all set.</i>

805
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,090
ROBOT:<i> But what about the How?</i>

806
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,845
A home like this will have
an advanced security system.

807
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,244
Aren't you just adorable? This is
where my years of experience come in.

808
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,610
<i>Every security system is designed
by security companies, not thieves.</i>

809
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,366
<i>It's not a question of if a thief
can break in, it's how long.</i>

810
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,371
<i>They place
all the heavy systems</i>

811
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,204
<i>where their customers
can see them.</i>

812
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,886
<i>They're selling
the feel of security.</i>

813
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,124
<i>It's never hard to find a spot that
they assumed no one could reach.</i>

814
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,603
<i>It just takes the right eye.</i>

815
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,604
ROBOT:<i> And have you found
that way in, Frank?</i>

816
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,444
FRANK:<i> You bet I have.</i>

817
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,362
<i>There's no alarm here.
Just a flimsy little lock.</i>

818
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,289
<i>They're asking for it.</i>

819
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,490
<i>That brings us to the safe.</i>

820
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,643
I'll bet you a steak dinner,
we'll find it right here.

821
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,245
Do you know
the correct combination?

822
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,810
That's where you come in.

823
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,166
Me?

824
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,884
<i>You're going
to brute-force it.</i>

825
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,371
ROBOT:<i> Brute force?</i>

826
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,249
<i>That sounds like it might
attract attention.</i>

827
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,084
<i>All it means is,
you're going to try</i>

828
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,128
<i>every combination
until you get it right.</i>

829
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,771
That would take
a human like me weeks.

830
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,046
How long would it take you?

831
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,202
Assuming it's
a three-number combination,

832
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,408
somewhere between four seconds

833
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,882
and one hour and 43 minutes.

834
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,565
FRANK:<i> It's perfection.</i>

835
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,768
<i>We know there's something
worth stealing.</i>

836
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,561
<i>We know when to go in, how to
get in, and how to get out.</i>

837
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,291
It would be a crime
not to do it.

838
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,605
So, how about it?

839
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,205
You have been thorough, Frank.

840
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,046
It is unlikely we'd be seen and
even less likely we'd be caught.

841
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,963
But although your
memory has improved,

842
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,371
you still have
a long way to go.

843
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,681
I'm fine.
I can handle this.

844
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,841
Are you in?

845
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,922
Only if you agree to eat a
low-sodium diet from now on.

846
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,163
Okay.
Okay.

847
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,405
What? What is it?
I'm trash to you?

848
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,283
You're acting like a baby.

849
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,250
Am I a bad baby?

850
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,245
FRANK: Oh, shit.

851
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,886
Is something wrong?

852
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,089
What are these people doing
with this kind of stuff?

853
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,241
I don't understand.

854
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,883
Oh, this is way too hot.

855
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,961
Look at that.

856
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,647
We're just going to have
to sit on this, that's all.

857
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,246
We're just going
to have to sit on it.

858
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,804
It'll be fine. Yeah.

859
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,642
I made yours virgin, Frank.

860
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,961
Come on, buddy, I got troubles.

861
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,281
I need a little booze

It's not good
for your blood pressure.

863
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,210
You worry too much.

864
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,684
What are you smiling at?
You two are funny.

865
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,046
Ahem. Cheers, Daddy.

866
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,281
Cheers.

867
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,722
Also, Frank, there's
someone here to see you.

868
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,600
What? Just tell them
I'm not taking visitors.

869
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,886
MAN: Hello?

870
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,364
Hey, there. Hello, Frank.
This is Sheriff Rowlings.

871
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,686
How do you do?
How do you do?

872
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,364
This is my daughter, Madison.

873
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,441
Hello.

874
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,488
And your name again, was what?

875
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,289
You remember me.

876
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,771
I don't buy your whole act.

877
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,649
Excuse me? Who are you?

878
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,645
What is this about?

879
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,406
Are you aware that your neighbour up the
lane here was recently burglarized?

880
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,811
No. What neighbour?

881
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,927
ROWLINGS: Jake and his wife.

882
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,367
Yeah, real professional job.

883
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,966
Frank, computer brought your name up.
Frank Weld, right?

884
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,121
Guilty as charged.

885
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,361
I think I read about
you at the academy.

886
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,930
Come on, that is ridiculous.

887
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,049
The police have been hassling
him for his entire life

888
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,168
about a few mistakes
he made when he was a kid.

889
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,083
Ma'am, you misunderstand me.

890
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,970
The computer thinks Frank's
a suspect, of course.

891
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,246
I don't mean any disrespect.

892
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,164
I can't see him pulling a job
like this off at his age. Sorry.

893
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,322
JAKE: What?
What are you talking about?

894
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,731
He did it.
He obviously did it.

895
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,320
Jake, why don't you
go wait in the car?

896
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,920
I'm amazed that all these yuppies moving
in here just don't get hit more often.

897
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,607
I know, right? Listen, I
could really use your help.

898
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,762
As a consultant or something.

899
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,921
Be on the right side this time.

900
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,968
Are you kidding me?
Arrest him!

901
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,485
Okay. You know what?
Back off.

902
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,925
Calm down.
Jake, stop it.

903
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,047
MADISON: What?

904
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,600
Everything's fine, okay? No one's
accusing anyone of anything.

905
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,091
We're all friends here.

906
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,800
What do you say, Frank?

907
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,130
My robot will be happy
to see you to the door.

908
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,450
All right, all right.
It's okay, I know the way.

909
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,000
I had to ask.
You guys have a good day.

910
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,008
I know you were
in my library, Frank.

911
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,491
I know you were in my house.

912
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,891
Jake, come on.
I know.

913
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,086
ROWLINGS: Jake.

914
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,006
JAKE: I got a lot
of pull in this town.

915
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,805
Maybe I should stay
a few more days

916
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,689
and make sure
they don't bother you.

917
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,364
No. No, honey.

918
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,249
It's going to be fine.

919
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,447
Bye.

922

Oh, you know what?
I got something for you.

923
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,524
A little surprise.
I hope you like them.

924
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,489
Are those from
the crazy man's house?

925
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,246
No. No.

926
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,728
These are from the old days.

927
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,363
I want to donate them
to your cause.

928
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,442
You keep them out of sight and then
you can pawn them someplace far away.

929
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,124
I know the drill.

930
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,926
Would you call Hunter, please?

931
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,680
I know he's a pain in the ass,

932
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,324
but he's just
worried about you.

933
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,084
I don't want to...
Call him.

934
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,684
You can tell him I said he
was right about the robot.

935
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,331
Bye, Robot.

936
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,131
Goodbye, Madison.

937
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,327
Are you sure you're
going to be all right?

938
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,528
Yeah. I think I am, actually.

We better get back
in the house.

941
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,531
Did you notice that van before?

942
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,841
I first noticed it
at 3:04 a.m.

943
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,446
That son of a bitch,
Jake, isn't kidding.

944
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,010
Maybe you should call Hunter.

945
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,242
You don't seem to be reacting
well to Madison leaving.

946
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,051
Wait. Did you let those two
bastards through this house?

947
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,167
Yes.

00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,726
Frank, there's another
piece of evidence.

952

You must reformat me.

Yeah, okay. Hold on.
Just hold on with that.

Let me alone.
Let me alone for now.

01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,291
Frank, I'm concerned. I may have
to sedate you for your safety.

Any excuse to scan.

961
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,927

to call a hunter for?

Oh, yeah, Hunter.
No, he's sick of me.

Frank, you're not well.

967

No, I'm not. I'm dying.

What do you mean, you're dying?

Call Hunter.
Tell him I'm dying.

I don't think
you are dying, Frank.

No, it's just an exaggeration.
It'll get him up here.

What are you doing?

get you to a hospital.

01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,361
Yeah, what's in the trunk?

1035
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,521
Nothing. Golf clubs.

1036
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,011
Uh, a bag.

1037
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,050
Yeah, what's in the bag?
Dad!

1038
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,125
I don't know what's in that bag.
I found it.

1039
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,606
Beautiful.

1040
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,207
It's just beautiful.

1041
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,127
It's inside. They're inside.

1042
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,202
All right, Jake.
This is evidence.

1043
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,327
What the hell's going on?

1044
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,131
I want to search the house. Come
on, this is probable cause.

1045
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,247
Fine. Okay, fine.

1046
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,290
Okay, wait. Hold on. Wait a second.
Probable cause for what?

1047
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,489
Frank Weld is a suspect in a multi-million
dollar robbery up the road.

1048
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,961
What? That's impossible.
He's sick.

1049
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,806
He's sick.

1050
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,971
Good morning.

1051
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,368
Would you like to come in?

1052
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,401
(CRACKLING)

1053
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,850
Dad, why aren't you in bed?
What's going on?

1054
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,884
I'm just cooperating
with the cops.

1055
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,485
They always seem to
come and pester me

1056
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,289
whenever anything
remotely criminal happens.

1057
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,886
Yeah, but how are you feeling?

1058
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:04,770
I'm fine. I'm just not
getting enough sleep.

1059
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,130
I'm sorry, but thanks
for coming up to see me.

1060
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,126
Okay, wait, wait.

1061
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,248
Hey, any of you boys hungry?

1062
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,206
Wait a minute.
Where's his stupid robot?

1063
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,361
Who would like a selection
of fine cheeses?

1064
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,328
Nothing. You have got
to be kidding me.

1065
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,765
We have probable cause, okay?

1066
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,046
Not you.

1067
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,727
You're "dying"?

1068
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,001
You're playing games
about dying?

1069
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,889
I called Mom.
I called Madison.

1070
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,209
And what the hell are you?
You're lying for him?

1071
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,480
All right, everybody
get the hell out.

1072
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,450
We're not going anywhere until
we find what we're looking for.

1073
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,320
Hunter, don't worry.
There's nothing to find.

1074
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,165
Do you think I care? If there was anything
in that bag, I would turn you in myself.

1075
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,040
You're an egotistical prick,
you know that? I don't care.

1076
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,682
I just feel guilty because
at least I have feelings.

1077
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,603
The best thing you ever did
was being locked up

1078
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,120
so I didn't have
to be raised by you.

1079
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,042
Why do you think I left
you with a goddamn robot?

1080
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,925
Leave him out of it!

1081
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,968
Warning. Do not molest me.

1082
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,042
Dad, he's not your friend.

1083
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,122
He's a slave who, apparently,

1084
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,885
you can manipulate into
doing just about anything.

1085
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,891
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute, wait a minute.

1086
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,802
We should download
this thing's memory.

1087
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,887
Yeah.

1088
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,486
No, no.

1089
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,604
Just hold on there, now.

1090
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,604
You can't do that.
Frank, sit down.

1091
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,608
Warning. Do not molest me.

1092
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,761
ROWLINGS: You know
what you're doing?

1093
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,604
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

1094
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,681
Hello, there.

1095
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,603
Self-destruct sequence
initialised.

1096
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,281
Ten.

1097
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,727
Nine.

1098
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,961
You didn't.

1099
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,166
Eight.

1100
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,561
I'd run.
Seven.

1101
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,324
Frank, stay there!
Don't move!

1102
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,447
Six.

1103
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,249
He's lying.
Five.

1104
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,402
There's no bomb.
Four.

1105
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,681
Three.

1106
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,807
Goddamn it!
Come on, come on.

1107
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,927
Two.

1108
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,881
One.

1109
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,124
What a hunk of crap.

1110
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,930
Son of a bitch.

1111
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,366
Get in.

1112
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,446
Frank!

1113
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,086
Nice work.

1114
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,480
Terrific.

1115
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,609
ROBOT: You shouldn't
be driving, Frank.

1116
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,728
Pull over and
reformat my memory.

1117
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,406
It's the only way for you
to remain safe and healthy.

1118
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,687
Can't you just
erase the bad parts?

1119
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,683
My memory
is a holographic array.

1120
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,526
If I lost half of it, I'd still have every
memory, just in half the resolution.

1121
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:20,641
Okay, but you can't just
lobotomize yourself.

1122
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,202
It's like I explained to you, Frank.
I'm not a real person.

1123
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,889
We'll lay low till we get a
chance to go back for the stuff,

1124
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,962
and then we're out of here.

1125
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,241
Are we going to
lay low here, Frank?

1126
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,086
I hope so.

1127
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,961
Here. Do your stuff.

1128
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,880
Hey, there.

1129
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,201
Oh, my God, Frank. Hunter called me.
Are you okay?

1130
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,441
Hunter called you?

1131
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,363
How did you get in here?
You're not allowed back here.

1132
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,521
I came to apologise.

1133
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,806
You don't need to apologise.

1134
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,963
You've just been very forgetful
these days, that's all.

1135
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,690
No, I'm not forgetful.

1136
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,445
(STAMMERS) I've just
been a little bit busy.

1137
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,126
I'm fine, really.
Please, can I come in?

1138
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,923
Okay. Come in.

1139
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,446
Thank you.

1140
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,764
I'm kind of
in a bit of trouble.

1141
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,444
Of course you are.

1142
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,400
No. Well, this is
worse than late fees.

1143
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,285
I guess I'm sort of on the lam.

1144
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,441
On the lam?

1145
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,567
Yeah.

1146
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,081
I've led a very colourful life.

1147
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,684
I'm a cat burglar.

1148
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,962
You took the <i>Don Quixote.</i>

1149
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,247
Didn't you? Oh, Frank.

1150
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,606
Well, I...

1151
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,608
I just wanted you to have it.

1152
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,525
Is that you?

1153
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,407
Yes.

1154
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,531
Is that me?

1155
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,445
JENNIFER: When I moved back,
you just didn't remember.

1156
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,609
After our walk, we go
home, read for an hour.

1157
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,004
Then we have lunch.

1158
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,120
And... (STAMMERS)

1159
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,407
Then we stake out
our next target.

1160
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,481
Frank, wait.

1161
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,490
You really don't know any other information?
You haven't seen any...

1162
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,847
Oh... You gotta be kidding me.
Frank!

1163
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,926
Frank. Frank!
Hold it right there!

1164
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,047
Dad!

1165
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,490
No. Dad, stop!
Would you just stop?

1166
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,369
Frank, don't you lock this!

1167
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,723
Don't you touch
that robot, Frank!

1168
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,404
You are making this more
complicated than it has to be.

1169
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,290
By the time they get up here, we
can scale down from the window.

1170
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,091
Frank, stop.
Just wipe my memory.

1171
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,161
No.

1172
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:20,961
Frank, I know you don't like to
hear this, but I'm not a person.

1173
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,682
I'm just an advanced simulation.

1174
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,610
After you've wiped my memory,

1175
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,648
things can go back to normal,

1176
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,451
and you can continue
planning your next job.

1177

(DOOR RATTLING)

1178
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,487
What did you say?

1179
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,006
Remember, Frank?
Your next job.

1180
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,888
You deal in
diamonds and jewels,

1181
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,962
the most value by the ounce.

1182
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,250
Remember?
HUNTER: Dad!

1183
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,845
It's not too late, Frank.
Just open up.

1184
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,285
Don't give up.

1185
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,204
Lifting that high-end
stuff, no one gets hurt.

Except those insurance
company crooks.

1187
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,644
Show me what to do.

1188
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,245
You have to open the round panel
in back and push the small button.

1189
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,483
I've unlocked it for you.

1190
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,968
I knew you had an off switch.

01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,969
Hey, how are you doing?

1194
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,325
It's Hunter.

1196
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,042
You want to go
for a walk with me?

1197
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,963
Yeah, that sounds good.

1198
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,607

1201
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,160
Princeton's good.

01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,241
Good?
