For the past eight years,

I've been breaking out of facilities

I think Hobbes used my reports
to make this place unbreakable.

Someone wanted this place

he has developed a program

Yeah, Hives.

When Duck and Hives work together,
they always do a circle.

812
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:41,303
They may do it at
random times of day.

It doesn't matter
when they do it,

814
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,108
it always ends up being 128
strides, then they split up. Watch.

815

Now they each take a side.

816
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,148
Duck walks 63 strides,
Hives 65.

817
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,583
Then they meet up at the top.

818
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:57,485
The guard down there
at the bottom,

01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,521

he doesn't move much.

820
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:01,289

been here a while

I don't.

to the backers of The Tomb.

I was being sent?
