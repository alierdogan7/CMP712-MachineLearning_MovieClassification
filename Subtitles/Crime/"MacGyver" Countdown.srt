1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:05,572
(theme music playing)

2
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,652
Right.

3
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,660
Good morning.
Good morning.

4
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,177
(beeping)

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,682
Take a look at what
our eye-in-the-sky has to say.

6
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,183
What're they
calling her?

7
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,184
Henry.

8
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,686
200 miles across,

9
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,688
and we're headed
right down his throat.

10
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,690
I think our
passengers might object.

11
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,692
Not exactly
vacation weather.

12
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,193
Make a course adjustment

13
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,696
and see if we can skirt
Henry's west perimeter.

14
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,698
(phone buzzes)

15
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,699
Bridge.

16
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,701
Right away. Patch him through.

17
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,202
It's the home office
for you, Captain.

18
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,705
Captain Howard
aboard theVictoria.

19
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,206
Control, over.

20
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,211
I'll check it
out personally.

21
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,213
This is theVictoria.

22
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,215
(beeping)

23
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,717
What is it?

24
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,718
Bomb threat.

25
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,721
Take over the bridge.

26
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,222
Notify Henshaw and
Neilson to meet me

27
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,224
at the weather fax
compartment immediately.

28
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,225
Yes, sir.

29
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,236
(beeping)

30
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,239
What was that?

31
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,244
(alarm blaring)

32
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,757
MacGYVER:
Sure is great
to start off a sunny day

33
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,759
thinking about
the people you like most.

34
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,761
My pal, Susan, for instance.

35
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,765
She's my landlady, the
building maintenance person,

36
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,767
and the only human being
who's figured out

37
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,269
how to keep me organized. So,

38
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,271
how do I repay her?

39
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,773
A 21st century

40
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,275
breakfast, of course.

41
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,277
I wonder how
she likes her eggs.

42
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,279
Okay, Susan,thisis the future.

43
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,280
Uh-huh.

44
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,282
Or part of it anyway.

45
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,785
I think I'll hang loose
here in the past.

46
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:39,786
It might be safer.

47
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,787
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

48
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,796
First thing we have to do
is get the fridge open.

49
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,797
There it goes.

50
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,798
SUSAN:
Okay.

51
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,299
That's a start.
What's next?

52
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,804
Now we put Roboter to work.

53
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,305
(whirring)

54
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,306
Isn't she great?

55
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,308
Let's not go
straight to "great."

56
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,810
After all, I did
just meet her.

57
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,315
Let me guess-- you
like 'em scrambled.

58
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,319
Just watch.

59
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,821
Right to the pot.

60
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,830
Right to the pot, Mac?

61
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,333
Oh.

62
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,336
Love that modern technology.

63
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,839
It needs a couple
of adjustments, I guess.

64
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,340
I guess.

65
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,342
I'm not safe in the
past here either.

66
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,844
(phone ringing)

67
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,846
Incredible timing.

68
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,847
Mmm.

69
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,852
Whoever you are, I owe
an incredible debt of...

70
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:46,853
THORNTON:
MacGyver?

71
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,854
...gratitude.

72
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,356
Good, I'll take it-- right now.

73
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,858
Peter?

74
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,860
On second thought...

75
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,861
Now, hold it.

76
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,863
Mac, I've got a job for you.

77
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,866
Pete, I'm on the verge
of a great discovery.

78
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,868
(Susan chuckles)
Sure, you are.

79
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,369
The world's just waiting

80
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,372
to find out
about shoe polish egg foo yung.

81
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,373
What was that?

82
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,375
It's my cranky maintenance lady

83
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,878
being her usual self; cranky.

84
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,879
Mac, I need your help.

85
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,881
Last time you said that to me,

86
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,384
I ended up in Washington wearing
a pin-stripe suit and a necktie.

87
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,386
Yeah, well,
that was a show-and-tell.

88
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,888
This is for real.

89
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:22,889
It's important.

90
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,390
How important?

91
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,392
Well, a cruise ship
in the north Pacific

92
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,895
with 1,100 passengers
and a bomb threat

93
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,397
from some clown
calling himself Viking.

94
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,398
How's that?

95
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,901
You make it kinda tough
for a guy to say no.

96
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,902
Team briefing

97
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,403
at my place. I think I'll have

98
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,906
at least one
pleasant surprise for you.

99
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,908
Get here as fast
as possible, will you?

100
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:42,909
MacGYVER:
See you then.

101
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,417
I had this contract
with Pete Thornton's outfit

102
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,921
that says I take only
those jobs I want to take.

103
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,924
Now, you'd think
I'd say no once in a while,

104
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,425
especially when Pete wants

105
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,428
to put me in the middle of
the ocean to baby-sit a bomb,

106
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,430
but, no.

107
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,432
Somehow he always seems

108
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,434
to come up
with a convincing argument,

109
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,437
and then he holds out
a carrot like this...

110
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,439
"special surprise."

111
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,440
Charlie!

112
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,444
Charlie Robinson?!

113
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,446
MacGyver?
Is that you?

114
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:21,948
I don't believe it.

115
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,449
Charlie.

116
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,450
Good to see you.

117
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,451
How you been?

118
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,953
Good, good, real good.

119
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:27,954
How's Shirley?

120
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,455
Well, lately, Mac,
Shirley's been

121
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,457
a little bit
under the weather.

122
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,959
Darned near every morning.

123
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,461
You're kidding.

124
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,964
That's terrific.

125
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,465
Congratulations, Pop.

126
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:40,466
Hey, thanks
a lot, Mac.

127
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:41,968
You know, we've
been trying

128
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,469
a long time, and it
finally happened.

129
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,471
That's terrific.

130
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:46,973
What're you doinghere?

131
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,976
Well, what is it you
always say? Um...

132
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,477
Too big to talk about?

133
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,979
You haven't been
talking to a guy

134
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,480
named Peter Thornton,
have you?

135
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,482
You got called up
for this one, too?

136
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,483
This is great.

137
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,985
This is great.
Charlie, you get back

138
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,486
in your car
and you go back home.

139
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,487
Uh-uh-uh.

140
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,989
This one's gonna
bail your old dad out.

141
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,992
You know, Uncle Sam found me in
the Computer Expert file of his

142
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,995
and put $25,000
on the counter.

143
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,496
Look, Charlie,

144
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,999
this isn't you
and me in 'Nam,

145
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,500
and there wasn't
a Shirley

146
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,003
or a little one
on the way back then, either.

147
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,004
Yeah, I know, I know,

148
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,506
and there wasn't a supply
company and a home mortgage

149
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,508
looking bankruptcy
square in the face.

150
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,510
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

151
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,511
Nothing more to say.

152
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,512
I'm in.

153
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,014
Come on.

154
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,016
You got a screw loose,
you know that?

155
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,018
So? What else is new?

156
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,519
(laughing)

157
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,028
Suspects.

158
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,529
50 to start.

159
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,530
More to run down.

160
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,032
Any priority
you want set up?

161
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,534
I recruited you to do
a job on this, Mike.

162
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,037
It's yours, the best way
you see getting it done.

163
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,038
That's all I
need to hear.

164
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,539
Carlyle, let's get
an EPIC link-up

165
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,541
with Central East
and Southwest regions.

166
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,043
I want a profile
on these guys.

167
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,544
M.O.'s smoking the wires.

168
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,546
MacGYVER:
Doggone it, Pete.

169
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,049
Charlie's got
no business taking this gig.

170
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,050
You're Peter Thornton.

171
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,551
Charlie Robinson--

172
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,552
and ignore him.

173
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,054
He has this
irrepressible

174
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,056
paternal instinct toward me.

175
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,057
Mac, what is it?

176
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,558
You guys were in 'Nam together.

177
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,561
You were a bomb-
diffusing team, right?

178
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,562
Only the best.

179
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,565
Okay, coordination
and control come from here.

180
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,068
We've got direct communications
with theVictoria.

181
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,570
They've got a search going
for the bomb right now.

182
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,572
What's the threat
assessment?

183
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,074
Well, there was
a warning bomb

184
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,575
that wiped out
the weather room

185
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,077
and killed
the captain.

186
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,578
Come here.

187
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,082
There is a, uh,
storm front moving in

188
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,583
that makes it
impossible

189
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,585
to put the passengers
into lifeboats.

190
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,087
What about sea
or air rescue?

191
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,088
THORNTON:
No way.

192
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,089
There are no ships

193
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,590
or air rescue units close enough

194
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,593
to get to theVictoriabefore
she's into the typhoon zone.

195
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,095
ROBINSON:
So how do we
get there?

196
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,097
Take a bus?
No, you take

197
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,598
a jet to Midway
and a Huey chopper

198
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,100
the rest of the way to the ship.

199
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,102
Pete, given
any consideration

200
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,604
to tracking down
this bomber?

201
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,605
Oh, we're on that,

202
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,607
with an expert--
Mike Donahue.

203
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,609
No, sir, we just
can't figure it out.

204
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,610
Donahue? There
was a Donahue

205
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,113
that ran the 227 Bomb
Squad out of Da Nang.

206
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,614
Couple of years
before our time.

207
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,116
Well, that's him.

208
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,119
Medical discharge and back
in the Police Department.

209
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,120
He runs one of the best

210
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,123
bomb investigation units
in the country. Mike?

211
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,124
They've located the bomb.

212
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,126
Near theVictoria'sengine room.

213
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,628
Disguised as an
electrical cabinet,

214
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,131
two feet across,
three feet in height,

215
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,632
below the water line.

216
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,634
Threat assessment verified, eh?

217
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,137
You the guys that get
to find out how it ticks?

218
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,139
Oh, uh, MacGyver,
Robinson-- Mike Donahue.

219
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,140
Heard a lot about you.

220
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,142
Only the best.

221
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,143
Thank you.

222
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,145
That's what the man said
about you guys.

223
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,647
The question is,
how good is this Viking?

224
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,649
Patch from shipping
headquarters coming through.

225
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,151
Viking's on the line.

226
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,152
Put it on the P.A.

227
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,653
Start a trace.

228
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,155
(distorted man's voice):
Good morning.

229
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,657
This is Viking.

230
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,659
You will be interested
to know that I am aware

231
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,161
that Mr. Thornton
is listening in

232
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,163
from his headquarters.
In fact, I know

233
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,665
all about your efforts,
Mr. Thornton, and the experts

234
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,668
you have recruited to stop me.

235
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:08,674
Donahue. How's the leg, Donahue,
the one you lost in Vietnam?

236
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,176
Robinson?

237
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,678
Congratulations
on the upcoming baby,

238
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,182
and, of course, your ex-partner,
the inventive Mr. MacGyver.

239
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,684
Hey, Pete, nice security.

240
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,186
Mac, I don't want to hear it.

241
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,689
The bomb is set
to go off at 6:30 p.m.,

242
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,192
your time, ten
and one half hours from now.

243
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,194
The way to stop the bomb

244
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,696
is to put together
$6 million and deliver it.

245
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,198
The switching station at Proctor

246
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,699
puts the call
somewhere in Westwood.

247
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,701
Notify all field units.

248
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,703
Please, don't disappoint me.

249
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:38,704
(dial tone)

250
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,209
Damn.

251
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,711
6:30.

252
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,213
It's a five-hour flight
to Midway,

253
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,715
another two and a half hours
on the chopper.

254
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,217
That gives us about three hours

255
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,718
to work on the bomb
once we get there.

256
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,733
MAN 1:
This is Whiskey Sierra Bravo
to Midway Tower.

257
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:11,737
Requesting confirmation on a
stand-by chopper for bomb team.

258
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,240
MAN 2:
Midway Tower. We copy,
Whiskey Sierra Bravo.

259
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,742
Proceed directly to helipad
for immediate liftoff.

260
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,253
Ah, the tools of our old trade.

261
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,256
Boy, these bring back
a few memories.

262
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,759
Yeah, like the time you hocked
'em for a night out in Saigon.

263
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,261
Only the essentials, MacGyver.

264
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,762
And if I remember right,

265
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,265
you had one of your most
memorable evenings

266
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,266
in the French Quarter.

267
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,767
Oui, monsieur.

268
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,270
Victoria'sdead ahead.

269
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,774
We'll have to cable you down.

270
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,775
Then I'm out of here.

271
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,278
No telling when that
storm will roll in.

272
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,780
Let's start with
your bag of bomb tools.

273
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,782
It'll help me line up
on wind direction.

274
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:13,799
(excited chatter)

275
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,301
I want you to cordon
this area off

276
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,303
and keep the passengers
way back.

277
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,304
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,306
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

279
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,808
Could you clear
this area, please?

280
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,813
Okay, boys, I've got cable
control in the cockpit.

281
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:28,814
Let her go.

282
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,827
MacGYVER:
Bob, we got
a winch malfunction.

283
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,830
I can't override, Mac.

284
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,834
ROBINSON:
Mac, we're going
to lose our tools.

285
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,836
MacGYVER:
Correction, Charlie.
They're already gone.

286
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,339
They've lost their cable.
They'll never make it.
They have to.

287
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,343
ROBINSON:
Mac, that bomb's not
waiting for anybody.

288
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,848
A little more
than three hours--

289
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,850
that's all
we have left.

290
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,367
Where you going, Mac?

291
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,369
MacGYVER:
Well, we can't
just sit up here

292
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,870
and look like a bunch
of dummies.

293
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,872
What do you say
we work out a way

294
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,375
to turn this cargo net
into something useful?

295
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,876
You mean like
a rappelling line?

296
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,378
Yeah, something like that.

297
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,381
Mac, you're a wonder,
a true wonder.

298
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,887
Just survival, Charlie.

299
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,895
Hand me that
carabiner, will you?

300
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,404
Listen, you can still go back
to Midway on the chopper.

301
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,406
And miss a ride like this?

302
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,408
I think not.

303
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,410
Hang on to that for me,
will you, Bob?

304
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,414
Pick a number between
one and ten. Quick.

305
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,415
Seven.

306
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,916
Close, but wrong. I go first.

307
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:11,917
Hold her steady, Bob.

308
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,419
We want to keep him dry.

309
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,920
BOB:
I'll vote for that.

310
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,422
Give me the count

311
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,423
when ready.

312
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,424
Hooking up.

313
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,434
He's on the rail.
Stand by.

314
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,437
Bomb's away, Charlie.

315
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,941
Go, Mac.

316
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,944
(people gasping)

317
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,457
Contact Control.

318
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,459
Tell them they're on board.
Right.

319
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,464
I'm Carole Tanner, acting
captain of theVictoria.

320
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,465
Captain, name's MacGyver.

321
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,966
This is Charlie Robinson.

322
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:01,967
Captain.

323
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,469
The red cargo bag.

324
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,970
Was it important?

325
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,973
Well, that kind of depends
on the bomb, ma'am.

326
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:08,974
Can we get to it?

327
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,977
Engine room.
Follow me.

328
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,484
Captain, what have you
told the passengers?

329
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,985
As little as possible.

330
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:26,992
MacGYVER:
How long you planning on keeping
the passengers in the dark

331
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,494
about all this?

332
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,996
TANNER:
We're trying to steer
around a typhoon

333
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,499
which prohibits any thought
of using lifeboats.

334
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,501
And there's
a bomb on board.

335
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:39,004
What do you suggest I do,
Mr. MacGyver, create panic?

336
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,006
Well, if it was me,
I'd be awfully curious,

337
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,008
especially with Charlie
and me coming on board

338
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,511
a couple hours after
that first bomb went off.

339
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,514
Well, tell me, Mr. MacGyver,
would you want to know

340
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,516
that a very good
possibility exists

341
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,518
that you could die
a violent death

342
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,019
sometime during
the next three hours?

343
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,524
Yes, ma'am, I would.

344
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,540
That's it.

345
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,543
We're convinced it was placed
during dry dock last month.

346
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,045
It wasn't really seen until
we started looking for it.

347
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,047
Ooh, looks just like
it belongs here.

348
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,050
Yeah, until you
pull this panel off...
Don't touch that.

349
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,051
It's okay.

350
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:30,055
Our electrical engineer saw it
was the bomb after he opened it.

351
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,057
We've touched nothing else.

352
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,560
(whistles)

353
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,062
Do you believe this?

354
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,567
This guy is no amateur.

355
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,069
ROBINSON:
Oh, just look at those
bomb triggers, Mac.

356
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,571
Uh-huh.

357
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,573
Mechanical,
electrical,
chemical.

358
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,575
Get through one,
you got another.

359
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,578
And pray that we
take them out in
the right sequence.

360
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,579
Here.

361
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,080
The connection
to Mr. Thornton

362
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,081
in Los Angeles
is ready.

363
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,586
Pete?

364
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,588
Yo, Pete?

365
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,089
Yeah? Mac?

366
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,591
I can hear you.

367
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,593
How's it look?

368
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,595
Well, this one looks like
it's going to be a maze

369
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,597
of triggers before we get
to the real thing.

370
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,598
Mike, are you

371
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,600
hooked up to the NCIC
bomb file?

372
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,603
Right. Just call out the trigger
M.O.'s, we'll track 'em.

373
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,104
That's a good idea, Mac.

374
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,106
Well, I just hope it pays off.

375
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,108
Now this first one
I'm looking at.

376
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,111
we ran across
a whole bunch in 'Nam.

377
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,112
Yeah,

378
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,614
the Ling Chow bomber.

379
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,115
Oh boy.

380
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,116
Well, I know his technology.

381
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,619
You're looking at some kind
of chemical detonator.

382
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,120
Yeah, powder in a dish.

383
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,622
Um...

384
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,124
Sodium? It could be sodium?

385
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,125
Well, it could be,

386
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,128
but I don't see any source
of water to set it off.

387
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,131
It's sitting below a heat
sensitive thermocouple,

388
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,633
little blue light on it.

389
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,136
Boy, dishful of some kind
of powdered chemical.

390
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,638
Geez, it could be anything.
Well, it's a start.

391
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,140
Okay, guys, one list of Ling
Chow bomber types coming up.

392
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,645
Well, partner, who scrubs
and who assists?

393
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,646
Pick a number.

394
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,148
Uh, Captain?

395
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,149
Ma'am?
Hmm?

396
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,151
Oh, uh, yes,
Mr. Atkins.

397
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,153
We found another bomb.

398
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,656
D Deck, compartment six.

399
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,157
Where exactly is this D Deck?

400
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,665
Okay, we're here below
the waterline,

401
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,167
and that's D Deck,
compartment six.

402
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,169
Opposite ends of the ship.

403
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,171
Could be synched
to go off at the same time.

404
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,674
I'm counting down from
three hours, six minutes.

405
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,175
Well, partner,
looks like we both scrub.

406
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,178
How can I help?

407
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,681
Uh, just hold a steady course

408
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,684
and think positive thoughts.

409
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,685
I'll do that...

410
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,188
as soon as I've had
a talk with the passengers.

411
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:00,706
Well, it's just
you and me now.

412
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,214
Now hear this.

413
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,717
This is the captain speaking

414
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,720
with an important message
for all passengers.

415
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,223
The explosion that killed
Captain Howard six hours ago

416
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,726
was the beginning
of a grotesque threat

417
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,729
made upon all of us
aboard theVictoria.

418
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,235
That's it.

419
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,237
Good luck.

420
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:39,745
Mac,

421
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,746
can you read me?

422
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,748
Yeah, loud and clear.

423
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,252
Viking must have had
a field day in dry dock.

424
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:51,256
Is your bomb built into a phony
electrical panel like this one?

425
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:55,260
Yep. All the triggers are
behind a sealed glass cover.

426
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,763
I've got an exact copy
of yours up here.

427
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,265
This stuff around the edge...

428
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,769
looks like some kind
of booby trap.

429
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,276
Plastic explosive, maybe?

430
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,780
No, I'd say it's some kind
of a silicon base.

431
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,282
Probably a sealer of some kind.

432
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,284
Well, whatever.

433
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,285
We've got to get inside.

434
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,787
We're counting down fast.

435
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,789
Well, don't push it, Charlie.

436
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,290
We don't want
to rush things here.

437
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,293
I got a hunch that's exactly
what Viking wants us to do.

438
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,796
(distorted man's voice):
This is Viking.

439
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,798
I assume you found
the second bomb by now

440
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,800
and have gathered
the $6 million.

441
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,802
So listen closely.

442
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,805
You must realize that you
do not have either the time

443
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,306
or intelligence
to stop my bombs.

444
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:42,808
Only I can stop it,

445
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,310
provided you do
exactly what I tell you.

446
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,814
If my instructions are not
carried out precisely,

447
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,816
you will not hear from me again,

448
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,819
and you will not learn
how to disarm the bombs.

449
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,821
You will put the money
in a briefcase

450
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,825
and place it in locker number
324 at the downtown bus depot.

451
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,828
And, gentlemen, it will be both
futile and dangerous

452
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,329
to try to locate me.

453
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,330
Carlyle?

454
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,832
No trace.

455
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,834
He knows exactly
what he's doing.

456
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,844
THORNTON:
MacGyver, Robinson, we've got
a dead end on the trace.

457
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,846
No Ling Chow suspects.

458
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,848
I'm gonna go ahead
with the money drop.

459
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,851
Do you hear that, Charlie?

460
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,852
ROBINSON:
Yep, but suppose Viking

461
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,854
doesn't live up to
his end of the bargain?

462
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,856
MacGYVER:
Well, what do you suggest?

463
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,858
ROBINSON:
I'm suggesting maybe Viking
won't tell us

464
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,360
how to turn this thing off.

465
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,362
So we can't sit around and wait.

466
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,864
Pick a number, Mac.

467
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,365
Uh, no, n-no, no, no.

468
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,867
We played that game already.

469
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,370
I guess that means
it's my turn to go first then.

470
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,372
You just follow in my footsteps,

471
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,874
partner.

472
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,876
All right.

473
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,880
But, Charlie, remember
the routine in 'Nam--

474
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,882
by the numbers.

475
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,885
Slow and easy,
and we'll live forever.

476
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,888
By the numbers.

477
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,897
Call it out, Charlie.

478
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,398
What's your benchmark?

479
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,901
All right, take it down
this way.

480
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,904
I'm gonna probe the gasket
that runs around the outside

481
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,405
of the bomb casing.

482
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,908
The one you think
is a silicone base.

483
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,912
I'm using a dental probe
from the ship's doctor.

484
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,914
It's a number three.

485
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,417
I'm sealing the entry
with petroleum jelly.

486
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,424
I'm penetrating the seal.

487
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,425
The chemical in that dish

488
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,427
could be any one
of a number of things.

489
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,428
ROBINSON:
I just need to touch it.

490
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,931
Get one sample to test.
Then we'll know.

491
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:49,935
If I could just reach that dish.

492
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,452
I'm getting there.

493
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,954
I'm getting there, Mac.

494
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,956
Hey, easy, easy, Charlie.

495
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:12,958
(hissing)

496
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,960
It's a vacuum, Mac!

497
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,461
It's a vacuum!

498
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,463
You've gotta fill...!

499
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,464
Charlie!

500
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,966
(static)

501
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,968
Charlie...

502
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,577
All right, damage control

503
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,079
has the area
isolated and secure.

504
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,082
The affected compartment
is shut tight and holding.

505
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,585
Now, I want lifeboats ready
and a lifeboat drill scheduled.

506
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,087
The passengers
will be briefed then.

507
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,588
Right.

508
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,595
Are you okay?

509
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,601
You know, Charlie and I

510
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,604
busted 51 bombs
together in Vietnam.

511
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,106
My God.

512
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,607
Charlie used to put
a little scratch

513
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,608
on the wall above our bunks

514
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,111
every time we'd get back
from doing one.

515
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,113
We used to tell anyone
who would listen

516
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,115
that we were going
for the record.

517
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,617
The day we shipped out,
he counted 'em.

518
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,619
51.

519
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,122
Then he laughed, just laughed.

520
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,624
I'm sorry.

521
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,126
If we get out of this one,

522
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,128
it's because Charlie
figured out number 52

523
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,630
in the split second
before he died.

524
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,631
I don't understand.

525
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,134
He yelled "vacuum."

526
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,636
That whole bomb is in a vacuum.

527
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,138
The chemical is phosphorus,

528
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,640
triggered to explode
when air hits it.

529
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,145
The phosphorus flashed,
tripped a thermocouple,

530
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,146
and that was that.

531
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,149
But, but if the bomb
is built inside a vacuum,

532
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,651
then there's no way you can
take that glass face off

533
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,153
without air getting in.

534
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,656
Unless I fill that vacuum
with something else.

535
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,158
Like?

536
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,660
You got any neon signs
on board?

537
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,162
The search party
found another one.

538
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,664
In the auxiliary power room.

539
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,666
You got two
neon signs?

540
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,667
This is becoming insane.

541
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,669
How many more can there be?

542
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,670
Well, we're sure
of the two

543
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,173
and there's no reason to believe
they're not in sequence,

544
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,674
so we're gonna have
to disarm them simultaneously.

545
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,676
I can't be in
two places at once,

546
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,179
so I'm gonna need
a new partner.

547
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,181
Any likely candidates on board?

548
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,682
Me.
I'll do it.

549
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,683
Carole.

550
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,685
I mean, Captain.

551
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,187
The whole ship
is your responsibility.

552
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,191
If those bombs go off,
there'll be no ship to command.

553
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,193
In any case, Mr. Atkins,

554
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,695
you are fully competent
to handle her.

555
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,197
Can we get started?

556
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,198
Yes, ma'am.

557
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,200
MacGyver,

558
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,201
any objections?

559
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,203
As long as you don't mind
taking orders

560
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,704
instead of giving them...
Captain.

561
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,706
I always bow to experts.

562
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,208
And, um...

563
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,710
I think we can find
a couple of neon lights

564
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,711
in the lounge.

565
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,218
I'd say we're in pretty
good hands, Mr. Atkins.

566
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,220
Yes, sir.

567
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,243
Guess we put
the ransom money

568
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,246
in locker 324

569
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,748
and then we pull the key.

570
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,750
How's our Viking man
take delivery?

571
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,753
He probably already made himself
a duplicate.

572
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,755
All right, let's go.

573
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,763
Hey.

574
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,764
How about my carrying that?

575
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,266
Why?

576
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,268
I never lifted six
million bucks before.

577
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,269
That'd be a cheap thrill.

578
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,270
I'll carry it.

579
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,771
You keep thinking
about it... out here.

580
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,773
Aw, come on. Why?

581
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,275
Why? Donahue
has a dozen cops

582
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,776
covering this place.

583
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,777
Donahue's inside.
Yeah?

584
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,778
I'll be inside.

585
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,281
We need one of our men
out here as a backup.

586
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,782
And you're the lucky winner.

587
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,292
Com check.

588
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,295
Guess who?

589
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,798
Heads up inside, Donahue.

590
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,300
The money's coming in.

591
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,807
(over P.A.):
This is the last call

592
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,809
for interstate service
to San Francisco,

593
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,811
Reno and Salt Lake City.

594
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,813
Boarding at Gate Three.

595
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,315
All right, I'm going
out to the car.

596
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,317
I'll call in and check
on that M.O. follow-up.

597
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,319
Right.

598
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,820
Boy, there's less than
an hour to go.

599
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,322
Something has to give.

600
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,824
Yeah, I'm just afraid of
what that something is.

601
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,329
All right,
let's stay alert, people.

602
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,337
All right, Captain,
what we're gonna do here

603
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,339
is make a little fair exchange.

604
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,341
What do you say
we replace the vacuum

605
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,343
with a little neon gas?

606
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,344
But I got to admit

607
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,346
I was a little surprised
to see you in charge

608
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,847
of this whole ship.

609
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,349
No more than I, MacGyver.

610
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,851
Everything happened
kind of fast around here.

611
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,355
Just give me directions.

612
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,857
First step:

613
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,859
take the sharpening stone
we got out of the bar

614
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,862
and score a little piece of
the neon right at the very end.

615
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,367
Here we go.

616
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,382
Now, before you break the tube,

617
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,384
make sure you got the cork handy
to plug it

618
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,386
so the gas doesn't escape.

619
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,388
One step at a time, right?

620
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,389
Right.

621
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,390
I'm almost through.

622
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,900
All right, now break the tube
and plug it fast

623
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,902
like I just did.

624
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,404
Okay.

625
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,909
Done.

626
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,912
I don't believe it.

627
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,415
Now, we're gonna work the tube
through the sealer.

628
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,916
And when I pull the cork,

629
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,418
hopefully I'll get
a momentary suction

630
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,919
and that ought to give us
enough time

631
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,921
to get the phosphorus
out of there.

632
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,423
You with me, Captain?

633
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:19,924
Under the circumstances,
MacGyver,

634
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,426
why don't you call me Carole?

635
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,929
Okay, Carole.

636
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,432
Nice and slow.

637
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,436
I'll go first.

638
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,451
I'm working
the silicone sealer now.

639
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,453
The glass tube is maintaining

640
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,455
an air-tight penetration.

641
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,956
Easy.

642
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,958
Real easy.

643
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,960
Just about through.

644
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,462
This is the tricky part.

645
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,468
Okay, I'm in.

646
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,474
Now I can pop the cork
against the edge of the dish.

647
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:13,978
Cork's out.

648
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,980
Neon gas exchange
has given me the vacuum.

649
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,483
It's working.

650
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,985
It's extracting the phosphorus
from the dish.

651
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,491
I have an environmental exchange
in the bomb cavity.

652
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,992
The dish is empty.

653
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,496
Removing the tube.

654
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,997
Dumping the phosphorus.

655
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,501
Okay, Carole, it's your turn.

656
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,504
Now work the tube through
slowly.

657
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,507
Keep moving it forward until you
get through the silicone sealer.

658
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,010
I'm petrified, Mac.

659
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,512
Hey, come on.

660
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,513
Who's better than us?

661
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,514
You can do it.

662
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,017
I'm about to break through
the inner seal.

663
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,522
Okay, Mac, I'm through.

664
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,524
Good.

665
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,527
Now go to the dish
and pop the cork.

666
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,031
Got it.

667
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,033
I'm in the dish.
It's sucking up

668
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,535
the chemicals, Mac.

669
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,036
I think it's gonna work.

670
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,038
I'm gonna make it.
I know I am.

671
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,540
Come on, come on.

672
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,044
Almost there.

673
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,547
Okay, got it.

674
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,050
Well, that's one small step
for local mankind,

675
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,052
and still a mile to go.

676
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,055
That thermocouple's
German made, Boltex.

677
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,058
If you guys want to check it out
in the bomber file,

678
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,060
we'll get on to this blue
cauldron on top of the bomb.

679
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,062
You've got less than
an hour now.

680
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,564
Yeah, tell me about it.

681
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,567
You guys any closer
to this Viking?

682
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,068
Not an inch.

683
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,571
(computer beeping)

684
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,572
Stay with that.

685
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,075
(distorted voice):
Mr. Thornton, this is Viking.

686
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,078
Despite your efforts to ensnare
me at the bus station,

687
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,079
I have the money.

688
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,081
But you have dealt in bad faith,

689
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,583
so I have decided
not to give you

690
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,084
the bomb-disarming instructions.

691
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,587
Goodbye, Mr. Thornton.

692
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,589
That's it.

693
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,095
Control to field operations.
Come in.

694
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,598
Control, this is Carlyle.
Go ahead.

695
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,601
But we haven't taken
our eyes off it.

696
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,603
Harrison, get this place
locked down.

697
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,605
There's a rumor
the six million's already gone.

698
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,606
I'm on it.

699
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,610
What is it?
Thornton says that
Viking's got the money.

700
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,113
(dog barks)

701
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,620
The money's gone.

702
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,635
(laughs):
He went in through here.

703
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,638
There's a utility room in the
back of the station, you know?

704
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,139
So nobody saw him, huh?

705
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,142
No, no, no, he had this thing
set up from square one.

706
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,645
Got a false back, hidden panel.

707
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,147
It was a nice,
neat job, huh?

708
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,149
There's a false
back on the locker.

709
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,151
Goes into the
back room.

710
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,653
Viking must've
had the money

711
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,655
two minutes after
we put it in there.

712
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,658
He is smart.
He's too damn smart.

713
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,659
(sighs)

714
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,663
Mac... I got some bad news.

715
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,665
Real bad.

716
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,668
Viking somehow outmaneuvered us
with the ransom.

717
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,171
He got it out of the locker
in the bus station.

718
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,674
We had it staked out,
but we didn't get him.

719
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,177
He just called...
gloating about it,

720
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,179
but worse than that,

721
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,183
he says that we broke faith
by trying to trap him,

722
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,686
so now he's really going
to punish us.

723
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,188
He's got the $6 six million,

724
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:48,192
but he's not going to tell us
how to deactivate the bombs.

725
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,695
He's going to let everybody
on that ship die.

726
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,699
So, the bottom line, Mac...

727
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,200
it's up to you now.

728
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:22,727
Okay, here's where we find out
just how good Viking is.

729
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,230
This pipework
in that blue cauldron

730
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,232
looked like our last trigger.

731
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,234
Can I tell you I haven't got
the smallest hint

732
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,235
of what I'm looking at here?

733
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,737
Well, you're doing just great.

734
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,740
And you're not alone.

735
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,245
All right now, I'm touching

736
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,248
the right-hand connection
at the circuit boards.

737
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,250
Read you.

738
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,753
Mac, freeze it!

739
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,254
What?

740
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,255
THORNTON:
The computer says

741
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,758
the Ling Chow bomber used
an unstable electrolyte

742
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,760
fluid trigger
on two sabotage attempts

743
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,262
in Cam Ranh Bay in 1973.

744
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,263
What does that mean?

745
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,265
The fluid carries a current.

746
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,267
Now our problem is

747
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,769
to neutralize it.

748
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,771
Donahue?

749
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,275
No, this doesn't
ring any bells.

750
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,778
(sighs):
Are you sure?

751
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,780
You commanded
the lead sabotage control group

752
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,782
in Cam Ranh Bay
'71 to '73.

753
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,785
Well, yeah, but
I didn't ride 'em
all personally.

754
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,787
This one...

755
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,290
All right, Mac,
hold on a second.

756
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,792
This could be an acid mixture.

757
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,794
MacGYVER:
Yeah, that's what I figured.

758
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,795
Breach the piping circuit,

759
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,296
and you release the acid.

760
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,800
And we'd release the acid
into this lateral wiring.

761
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,801
MacGYVER:
Yeah.

762
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,302
Probably create a short.

763
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,804
I understand.

764
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,806
All right, Carole,
I've got an idea here,

765
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,308
but we're going to need
some things for both of us.

766
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,810
Name them.

767
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,312
Uh, let's see, a pastry tube,

768
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,815
a container
of liquid oven cleaner

769
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,817
and a pint of milk, please.

770
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,318
CAROLE:
Milk?

771
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,320
Yeah, low fat, if you got it.

772
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,321
CAROLE:
Mr. Atkins?

773
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,322
Ma'am?

774
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,824
CAROLE:
You heard Mr. MacGyver.

775
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,327
Pastry tubes, oven cleaner,
low fat milk.

776
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,328
CAROLE:
Move.

777
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,329
On the double.

778
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,831
Aye, aye, Captain.

779
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,332
THORNTON:
MacGyver, milk?

780
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,335
Add a strong alkaline base
and an organic neutral...

781
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,838
if it's an acid,
we're in business.

782
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,339
What if you're wrong?

783
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,342
Well, then it's back
to the old drawing board.

784
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,848
MacGYVER:
All right, Carole,

785
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,349
this is the best
we have to work with.

786
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,351
Let's just think of it
as one giant dose

787
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,854
of industrial-strength antacid.

788
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,356
First the milk.

789
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,858
About three-quarters
full should do it.

790
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,359
You got that?

791
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,863
Yeah, got it.

792
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,867
MacGYVER:
Now I'm gonna top it off
with the oven cleaner.

793
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,368
You do the same.

794
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,871
And mix it up real good.

795
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,372
Okay, it's mixed.

796
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,875
Cap's going on.

797
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,377
Ready on this end, Mac.

798
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,379
All right, time check.

799
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,882
19 minutes and 41 seconds,

800
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,884
and counting.

801
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,386
Now I'm gonna pry up
the lead glass stopper seal

802
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,389
on top of the number one
cylinder, upper right quadrant.

803
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,390
Right.

804
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,900
Okay, Carole,
this is probably acid,

805
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,403
so just wait until I get
the stopper seals off.

806
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,908
There's the first one.

807
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,411
It's acid, all right.
I can smell it.

808
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,414
Now... number two.

809
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,919
Okay, Carole, go ahead

810
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,921
and remove your
number one stopper seal.

811
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,425
CAROLE:
Mac, is anything happening
with your acid level?

812
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,428
It seems to be okay.

813
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,430
CAROLE:
I've removed number two.
You done yet?

814
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,932
MacGYVER:
Just about...

815
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,933
got it.

816
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,941
All right, Carole,
I'm putting the first dose

817
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:02,446
of neutralizer into the acid
in cylinder number one.

818
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,449
Cylinder two.

819
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,955
There's a reaction starting.

820
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,459
All right, all four are treated.

821
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,961
How you doing?

822
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,963
Okay.

823
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,968
I am now removing
the final stopper seal.

824
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,977
Stopper seal's off.

825
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,479
MacGYVER:
Good job, Captain.

826
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,481
Now inject our milk
and oven cleaner mixture

827
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,482
into the acid.

828
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,484
Roger.

829
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,986
Am doing.

830
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,494
I have reactions.

831
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,998
CAROLE:
All four cylinders are cloudy.

832
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,001
(sighs)

833
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,009
MacGYVER:
Yeah, mine, too.

834
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,510
Now we wait,

835
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,012
keep our thumbs crossed.

836
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,014
Bridge, this is the captain.

837
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,016
I want the compartment
doors dog shut

838
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,517
on myself and Mr. MacGyver.

839
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,019
Have Engineering brace them.

840
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,021
If the bombs blow,

841
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,523
hopefully we'll
confine the explosion.

842
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,524
Ma'am...

843
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,525
Mr. Atkins,

844
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,527
this is no time
for conversation.

845
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,528
Will do, Captain.

846
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,030
What do you think, Donahue?

847
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,032
Seems like we might be
on the right track.

848
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,033
Well, I am impressed.

849
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,534
You just may have licked it.

850
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,036
Didn't your boys
do a post mortem

851
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,538
on this acid trigger in 'Nam?

852
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,541
Well, sure we did, but there
wasn't much left after she blew.

853
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,043
We ended up
with a lot of guesswork.

854
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,544
That's too bad.

855
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,046
Sure like to know if I'm right.

856
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,049
Well, we'll know
in about five minutes.

857
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,550
Hey, Pete,

858
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,053
don't forget, you and I have
got a little golf match

859
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,554
as soon as this job is over.

860
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,056
Yeah, right.

861
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,059
And I'm gonna spot you
a stroke a hole, buddy.

862
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,561
I'm gonna check in
with H.Q.

863
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,063
Keep monitoring.

864
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,066
Yeah, I will.

865
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:07,071
(indistinct conversations)

866
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,573
Mac? What's up?

867
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,075
We clear?

868
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,576
Yeah, we're on
a separate channel.

869
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,578
Come on, you never
played a round of golf

870
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,081
in your entire misspent life.
What's up?

871
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,582
Listen, I got a notion here.

872
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:23,087
Can you check out that incident
at Cam Ranh Bay in '73?

873
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,090
Yeah, sure I can.
What is it?

874
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,093
Well, this is a great piece
of booby-trap rigging,

875
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,594
and I mean good.

876
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:34,598
And anything this fine usually
has a personal signature to it.

877
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,101
It's not technology, it's art.

878
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,602
Art?

879
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,604
MacGyver, it's a damn bomb.

880
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,107
You just lack artistic taste.

881
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,609
Just cross check them for me,
will you, Pete?

882
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,612
Phosphorus, thermocouple,
acid trigger.

883
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,614
Who ran into them in 'Nam?

884
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,117
Yeah, it could be anybody
on a decon team.

885
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,119
Yeah, but who was
on each of these?

886
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,620
All of them.

887
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,124
You might be able to narrow it
down to a couple of names.

888
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,125
Maybe just one.

889
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,126
Viking.

890
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,129
Okay, Mac, I'm on it.

891
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,632
MacGyver?

892
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,633
Yeah?

893
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,634
I can see

894
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,136
a definite change in the fluid.

895
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,637
Is that what we want?

896
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,140
Absolutely.

897
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,642
It's neutralizing.

898
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,151
It's clear.

899
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,652
Okay.

900
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:33,157
MacGYVER:
Okay, everybody,
last step coming up, stand by.

901
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,160
I'm draining it now.

902
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,688
(bomb powers down)

903
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,193
CAROLE:
Mac, everything stopped.

904
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,195
Okay.

905
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,696
We did it.

906
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,700
(cheering, laughing)

907
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,209
MacGyver nailed that sucker.

908
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,210
Congratulations.

909
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,711
He sure did.

910
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,214
Uh, listen, I gotta
notify my people.

911
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,715
Stay on top of this, will you?

912
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,217
You got it.

913
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,724
Mac?

914
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,226
What is it, Pete?

915
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,227
We're back on
the separate channel.

916
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,729
The computer ran your pattern.

917
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,231
Came up with one name.

918
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,732
Want a guess?

919
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,733
Try me.

920
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,736
Viking had to be familiar with
each of these trigger-traps.

921
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,739
Especially the acid...
in Cam Ranh Bay.

922
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,743
Is that where
Donahue lost his leg?

923
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,245
Yeah.

924
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,248
If you knew, why did you bother
with the computer check?

925
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,749
Well, it gave us proof.

926
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,251
All I had was a hunch.

927
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,254
Well, it nails Donahue.

928
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,757
(mechanism humming)

929
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,261
(beeping)

930
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,763
Pete, back on the com line.

931
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,764
Right.

932
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,290
Carole, get the panel off now.

933
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,792
We have to get
to the bottom of the bomb.

934
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,794
It's reactivated.

935
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,797
CAROLE:
Okay, Mac,

936
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,299
I see what looks like two fuses.

937
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,301
Uh, yellow and blue.

938
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,804
Yeah, one cuts the circuit
and one fires it.

939
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,805
Which?

940
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:02,806
Donahue?

941
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:03,807
Right here.

942
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,308
I'm stuck.

943
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,809
I got less than a minute.

944
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,810
I need some help.

945
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,312
We've got all the pieces

946
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,813
of Viking's signature
right here in the bomb.

947
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,815
Stop it and we stop him.

948
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,317
Come on.

949
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,319
I've never made this kind
of call without Charlie.

950
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,820
We'd team it, two heads.

951
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,322
Both experts.

952
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,823
Help me, Donahue.

953
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,825
Help me and we'll stop this guy.

954
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:22,826
What's your head

955
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,328
and your gut say?

956
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,329
Yellow or blue?

957
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,331
Come on, Donahue.
You've been there.

958
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,332
You can make
a judgment call.

959
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,834
There are 1,100 people
aboard this ship.

960
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,339
Blue.

961
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,342
MacGYVER:
Carole, hold it.

962
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,843
In my tracks, Captain.

963
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,845
I go first. Just in case.

964
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,347
Pull the blue.

965
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,848
Thanks a lot, Donahue.

966
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,850
I'm pulling the yellow.

967
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,852
No!

968
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,855
(powers down)

969
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,856
Yellow, Carole,

970
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,857
yank it.

971
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,862
(powers down)

972
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,369
Viking.

973
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:09,873
Carole?

974
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,874
How you doing?

975
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,376
(chuckles)

976
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,379
I think I'll live.

977
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,381
(sighs)

978
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,882
Me, too.

979
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,390
Get him out
of my sight.

980
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,900
Your chopper will
be here in an hour.

981
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,402
Do you have to go?

982
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,904
Well...

983
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,406
I can recommend the cruise.

984
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,409
Gourmet cuisine,
sports and games.

985
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,410
Dancing every night.

986
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,412
It's a great place
to relax,

987
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,914
if you've been under stress.

988
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,418
Well...

989
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,422
do I get to sit at
the captain's table?

990
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:16,940
(theme music plays)
