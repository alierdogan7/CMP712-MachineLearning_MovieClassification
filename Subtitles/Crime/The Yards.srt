1
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,199
One, two.
One, two, three.

2
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,997
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

3
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,830
-Watch out, it's hot.
-Thank you, honey.

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,553
Leave it right there.

5
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,993
-No, no, no.
-Come on.

6
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,713
-Wait for Leo.
-Get out of here, Bernard.

7
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,314
-We're waiting for your cousin.
-I'm hungry.

8
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,229
He's real good-looking.
You're going to like him.

9
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,476
I am? You think so?

10
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,869
I know so.

11
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,389
I know these things.
I'm blessed with a gift.

12
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,510
Careful, it's hot!

13
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,473
-I got it.
-Val, this all looks wonderful.

14
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,791
Let's try and make a
little more room.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,116
What about your husband?
ls he coming?

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,996
Frank can't come.
I meant to tell you.

17
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,316
He's going to meet Leo
tomorrow at the interview.

18
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,835
Okay.

19
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,756
Well...

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,559
at least Bernard's eating.

21
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,508
Hey, sweetie.

22
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,030
-Hod you doing?
-Good.

23
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,517
Eric, you know Belvee? Belva.
Belva. Nice.

24
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,359
-Hey.
-Hey.

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,439
I told her about your cousin Leo.
I want her to meet him.

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,709
Oh, yeah?

27
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,589
Hey, everybody!

28
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,870
-He's here.
-Hey!

29
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,794
Hey, Ma.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,069
You good?

31
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,392
Yeah, I'm good.

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,638
-You look terrific.
-Thanks. You too.

33
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,838
-I'm so glad you're home.
-Me too.

34
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,309
Hey, Leo!

35
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,033
Leo the lion!

36
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,798
We all came to see you!

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,149
How you doing?

38
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,516
-I'm all right.
-I love you, man.

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,078
-Welcome home.
-Thanks.

40
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,475
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

41
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,635
How you doing?

42
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,398
-Welcome home.
-What's up, Dante?

43
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,318
-You look great.
-What's up, Todd?

44
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,953
-What's up, Leo?
-Neil.

45
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,991
You guys look like
you're doing good.

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,516
Don't worry. It'll come
your way soon.

47
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,671
I want you to meet Belva.

48
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,269
-Belva, this is Leo.
-Hi.

49
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,798
-Belva's a dancer.
-Hi.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,433
We've got so much food.

51
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,635
-Everybody, let's eat.
-Just dig in.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,319
Help yourselves.

53
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,834
Mr. Handler.

54
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,113
Where can we go
over a few things?

55
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,034
In the bedroom.

56
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,555
Come on.

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,357
My records show you
were released...

58
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,315
-at 4:00 this afternoon.
-That's right.

59
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,593
You're supposed to make
an arrival report.

60
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,668
Nobody told me.
I thought I had 24 hours.

61
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,869
Okay...

62
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,117
in the future you're re requested
to report with diligence.

63
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,078
Your profile says you
had some problems.

64
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,919
That you served 1 6
months for auto theft.

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,235
Your parole status...

66
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,317
has you on intensive supervision.

67
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,752
I'll have access to your bank
records, w-2s, pay stubs.

68
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,436
To keep track of your cash flow.

69
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,710
What about employment?
Know what you're gonna do?

70
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,512
I think I got something.

71
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,630
What's that?

72
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,989
My aunt's new husband has a
business. He's very important.

73
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,270
I'm interviewing with him tomorrow.

74
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,358
A couple of my friends have
been working for him.

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,072
What about your counseling?

76
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,836
I don't want to cause no problems.

77
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,032
I just want to be a productive
person again in society.

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,637
What do you think? He looks
good? He looks good.

79
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,113
I never knew him from before.

80
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,398
That's the point.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,433
I have nothing to go by.

82
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,069
Hey.

83
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,358
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

84
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,359
How come you're not out there?

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,308
Willie's talking with everybody
and I wanted...

86
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,437
to get away for a second.

87
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,395
-You and him still okay?
-Yeah.

88
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,951
We're thinking of settling down...

89
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,515
but he's so busy with
work right now.

90
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,155
I was sorry to hear
about your father.

91
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,993
He was a good man.

92
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,834
-We should go back out.
-Erica.

93
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,237
You like your new father?

94
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,079
He's all right.

95
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,317
Did you get my letters?

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,153
They must've forgot to
switch the fuse box.

97
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,834
There you are.

98
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,319
-Hi, Ma.
-Looks like a blackout.

99
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,350
Yeah.

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,316
Why don't you let
your cousin be?

101
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,476
See if they need something.

102
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,868
Excuse me. Aunt Kitty?

103
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,315
Yeah?

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,869
I wanted to thank you

105
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,674
and your husband for
the meeting tomorrow.

106
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,956
I'd do anything for your mother.

107
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,913
She's not doing too well.
You should know that.

108
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,192
Her heart is getting weaker.

109
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,108
-Here he is!
-Leo!

110
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,155
Hey, Leo.

111
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,199
What's up, buddy?

112
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,069
-You all right?
-Yeah, cool.

113
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,714
-Did you get a beer?
-I'm all right.

114
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,033
Me and the guys really
appreciate what you did.

115
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,115
-Don't say nothing to the cops.
-I'd never fold on you.

116
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,439
I want you to come...

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,114
work with us. When you
see Frank, tell him that.

118
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,799
-All right.
-Good.

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,912
-Come have a beer.
-You've had enough for everybody.

120
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,950
No.

121
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,675
We're going to the club this
weekend, like we used to.

122
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,110
-That sounds excellent.
-Be good.

123
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,158
-Leo, what's going on?
-You don't say hi?

124
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,679
You look good.

125
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,951
Excuse me, everyone.

126
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,435
Everyone!

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,716
I'm very happy to
have you all here.

128
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,874
And...

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,356
the last few years have been...

130
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,231
sometimes not so easy.

131
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,839
But that's all over now.

132
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,958
And so, from now on...

133
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,515
we'll have nothing
but good times.

134
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,433
That's all I wanted to say.

135
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,153
-Hear, hear.
-Absolutely.

136
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,316
Thanks.

137
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,600
Let's have some coffee,
if I can find the pot.

138
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,795
Ma...

139
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,670
I wanted to say that I'm sorry..

140
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,235
for everything.

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,433
Don't worry about it.

142
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,190
Go be with your friends.
Have a good time.

143
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,635
What's up, Todd?

144
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,356
-Leo, sit down.
-How you doing?

145
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,630
Bye, Denise.
My best to your mother.

146
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,079
Send him in, Denise.

147
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,355
Leo.

148
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,355
Nice to finally meet you.

149
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,753
-Nice to me you too.
-Sorry you had to wait.

150
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,073
-Sit down.
-Thanks.

151
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,475
So, uh...

152
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,159
how's your mother?

153
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,354
She's okay. She's trying.
She's battling.

154
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,750
We had nice conversations
about you.

155
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,393
She's a wonderful woman.
Supporting you by herself...

156
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,318
took a lot of guts.

157
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,235
I know.

158
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,396
I'll do everything I can
to make it up to her.

159
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,558
My wife and I tried to
help her out but...

160
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,199
she won't take it.

161
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,396
I admire that. The last 2 years
have been hard on her.

162
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,309
You got yourself in trouble.

163
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,230
-Stole a couple of cars...
-Yeah.

164
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,998
You did a little time, though.

165
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,115
I know it's tough in there,
but...

166
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,197
the business world ain't
much different.

167
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,039
You got to have eyes in the
back of your fucking head.

168
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,189
So, you know what
we do here?

169
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,110
If it's on a train or N.Y. subway,
we make or fix it.

170
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,991
Couplers, brakes, transformers,
everything.

171
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,839
-Got experience with that stuff?
-I could learn.

172
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,439
Learn... good.

173
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,190
There's training programs
out there for machinists.

174
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,993
I could make a call.

175
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,789
I need to support me and
my mother right now.

176
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,357
How long would a program take?

177
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,995
Good machinist?
Couple of years.

178
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,870
But you get a good union
job when you're through.

179
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,152
Four, five hundred a week.
And...

180
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,954
I could help you along
till you graduate.

181
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,310
What about Willie?
He didn't go to school.

182
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,590
Maybe I could work with him.

183
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,318
That's not a good idea for you.

184
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,359
What does he do?

185
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,676
He deals with suppliers mostly.

186
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,512
I really think you should
look into a program.

187
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,230
I'd have to think about that.

188
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,075
All right.

189
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,956
Why don't your mother
and you come over...

190
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,628
Saturday night for dinner?

191
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,634
The whole family will be there.
It'll be nice.

192
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,349
Okay.

193
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,429
Leo.

194
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,594
Thanks for coming,
and look...

195
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,914
you're a nephew now
and I'd like to help you.

196
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,393
-Ricky!
-Willie, what's up?

197
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,078
This is my friend, Leo.
Leo, Ricky.

198
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,077
-We studied together.
-Cool.

199
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,748
Thanks for Russell.
I like the system...

200
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,916
he put in for me.
I like the way it sounds.

201
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,678
-I told you, he's the best.
-You did.

202
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,235
-What do you want?
-Give me 2 Millers...

203
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,750
Jim Bean and rum and Coke.
Put it on my tab.

204
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,199
Willie, I don't know what
the fuck I'm gonna do.

205
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,952
About what?
Frank?

206
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,511
Yeah.

207
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,630
You don't have to go back to
school. He tried that shit on me.

208
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,673
I convinced him.
Let me work with the suits.

209
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,514
How did you do that?

210
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,628
He let me hang out and
I earned their respect.

211
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,357
You're throwing money around.
What do you do for this guy?

212
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,033
Come with me tomorrow
and see for yourself.

213
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,798
If you like it,
we'll talk to Frank.

214
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,679
I'm just asking. I can't
get into any trouble.

215
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,150
You won't get into trouble.
I won't let you.

216
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,634
Frank's a great man.

217
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,958
We got a real chance with him.

218
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,277
My mother spent her fuckin'
life on handouts and shit.

219
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,597
Now I got fucking money.
The sky's the limit.

220
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,195
You was always good with people.

221
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,038
I'm not too good with words.

222
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,838
You're my best friend.

223
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,599
I'll look out for you,
get you in.

224
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,952
I hoe it works out.
I'd like that a lot.

225
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,273
-I want to work with you.
-Great, next week.

226
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,993
What do you think about Belva?

227
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,273
She's good from far,
but far from good.

228
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,917
-Your cousin's beautiful!
-Yeah, she is.

229
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,233
Leo! Come on, dance!
Come on!

230
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,753
Come on! Dance!

231
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,233
Raise yourhands.

232
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,313
Empty your pockets.

233
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,712
Okay, you're all right.
Go ahead.

234
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,272
-Thanks, Glenn.
-All right, Willie.

235
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,032
You got a lot of
fuckin' security here.

236
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,198
-Is it all right coming with you?
-Yeah, you're fine.

237
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,913
They all know me here.

238
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,510
-What is this place?
-This is Borough Hall.

239
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,995
The train businesses
live and die here.

240
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,633
Today we're aftercontracts
worth $14 million.

241
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,037
It'll be a fuckin' fight.
All ourrivals are here.

242
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,393
Our main competition...

243
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,352
is the Weltech Corporation.

244
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,028
It's run by Manny Sequiera
and Hector Gallardo.

245
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,756
A minority company so they're
guaranteed 10% ofthe business.

246
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,152
Frank says Sequiera paid off2
councilmen to get that deal.

247
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,036
Paul Lazarides works
right underFrank.

248
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,913
He makes ourpresentations
to the TransitAuthority.

249
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,839
The head ofthe Authority
is AI Granada.

250
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,999
I keep him happy so he'll keep
sending the work our way.

251
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,354
I look okay?
I don't want to call attention.

252
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,551
You look great.
Let's go in.

253
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,078
We now come up
on order 4-2-3-9-9...

254
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,919
regarding the replacement
of rectifiers...

255
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,190
on the Queens and Bronx lines.

256
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,232
After careful review...

257
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,389
weighing price and
performance ratings...

258
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,919
the committee has decided...

259
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,556
to award the contract to the
Electric Rail Corp. of Maspeth.

260
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,999
Make a note of that.

261
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,636
Next, order 4-6-9-6-4.

262
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,877
For 230 couplers,
all for the subway...

263
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,196
-Mr. Supervisor, please.
-Hector, let me finish.

264
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,868
-It's part of our guarantee.
-I'm sorry. You're wrong.

265
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,275
We get the rectifiers is the deal.

266
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,550
Hector, let me finish, please.

267
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,749
They know it.

268
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,951
The deal for minority
quotas is 10%.

269
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,310
Which 10% is up to us.

270
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,239
If it were up to me,
Weltech wouldn't get anything.

271
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,237
Your failure rate is
through the roof!

272
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,078
-Because of them.
-Let me finish.

273
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,669
They're trying to put us
out and you're a part of it.

274
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,952
We want to make a protest
with the inspector general.

275
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,556
There have been several
investigations...

276
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,149
into the allegations
made by Weltech.

277
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,119
And we have been repeatedly
cleared of any wrongdoing.

278
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,196
They know this.

279
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,750
But they persist with these
outrageous accusations.

280
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,112
And I think they owe
us an apology.

281
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,515
-I owe you an apology?
-Yes.

282
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,278
-Let's get on.
-Asshole!

283
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,550
-Gonna give me the finger?
-Yeah, that's right.

284
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,836
I'll kick you right into
the middle of next week.

285
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,951
-Let's go, old man.
-What do you think I'm doing?

286
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,072
Running some sort of 3-ring
circus? Come on.

287
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,349
Gutierrez.

288
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,399
I don't know what you mean.

289
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,554
Why not work for us instead
of those "cabrones"?

290
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,672
Don't waste my time.

291
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,991
Let's go.

292
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,115
Who's this?

293
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,154
That's Leo.
You'll get to know him.

294
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,474
I'm not in a mood to
make new friends.

295
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,795
All right.

296
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,751
-Who's that?
-Frank's nephew.

297
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,473
Did he do time?

298
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,318
Yeah, just a little bit.

299
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,953
He's a good kid.

300
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,388
Got the money?

301
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,433
Say hello to your uncle for me.

302
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,191
-See you, Willie.
-Take it easy.

303
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,519
What the fuck was that?

304
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,509
Nothing. He's just...

305
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,116
very worried about wires.

306
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,309
Or he's got a thing for me.

307
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,317
It seems pretty fucking weird.

308
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,593
He get a cut of everything?

309
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,718
Don't worry about it.

310
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,753
He's a city official.
It's the way the system works.

311
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,873
But here's the good part.

312
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,189
This is for you.

313
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,753
Pretty good?

314
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,468
A little pocket change.

315
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,753
You've saved up a lot.

316
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,871
I spend it all on your cousin.

317
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,148
We got a few more things
to do this week.

318
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,910
Next week I'll take you
into the tunnels.

319
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,836
-That sounds good.
-All right.

320
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,155
Let's go do it.

321
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,198
In this business, favors are
more important than threats.

322
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,470
It's about making people
feel wanted and liked...

323
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,911
to feel appreciated.

324
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,838
Find out what they like,
and make it happen.

325
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,031
They want to go to a
ball game ora show...

326
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,278
get them the tickets.

327
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,710
They want something for
their wife orgirlfriend...

328
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,592
get them a nice fur.

329
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,234
Sometimes all the want
is some expensive wine.

330
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,993
Ifthey want cash...

331
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,913
there's always plenty.

332
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,118
Ifyou take care ofthem...

333
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,432
this business takes care ofyou.

334
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,200
Just don't spread it
all in one place.

335
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,439
Leo, are you ready?
We got to go soon.

336
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,235
Ma.

337
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,639
I got you something.

338
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,709
You don't have to get me anything.

339
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,308
I wanted to.

340
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,474
-I thought you needed it.
-Leo, you can't.

341
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,875
Every dollar is saved,
you know that.

342
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,349
It's beautiful.

343
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,069
Thank you.

344
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,468
Come on, Frank is
sending a car for us.

345
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,351
All right.

346
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,636
I'm going to change...

347
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,829
real quick.

348
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,715
That's it.
That's their house.

349
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,468
Bernard, get the door.

350
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,829
Mom, I'm already sitting down.

351
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,917
-Sorry we're late.
-Here they are.

352
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,633
You're not late.
The food just got here.

353
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,035
-Good.
-Come in, sit down.

354
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,275
Sit over there?

355
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,512
-Yeah?
-Sit over here, Leo.

356
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,118
-Good.
-Hi, Bernard.

357
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,118
-Nice house.
-Thanks. Glad you like it.

358
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,397
We're doing work on it.
I'm building a family room.

359
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,591
Those assholes wake us
every morning.

360
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,314
-Is that absolutely necessary?
-Don't start.

361
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,791
-Ma, could I have some lo mein?
-Frank...

362
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,479
this looks delicious.

363
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,156
-They got great food.
-It's a little rich sometimes.

364
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,670
This is Bernie's dish.
Give it to him.

365
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,677
Pass the rice when you're finished?

366
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,559
-Thanks, Mom.
-Thanks.

367
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,431
Leo...

368
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,596
did you tell your mother
what we talked about?

369
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,197
-What was that?
-I told him he should look into...

370
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,994
some training program
as a machinist.

371
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,316
That sounds fantastic.

372
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,794
I went with Willie and am
thinking of working with him.

373
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,475
Yeah, I know.

374
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,479
I want to talk to you about that.

375
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,797
That sounds good.
Two of them working together.

376
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,798
I don't understand. I thought
we had this conversation.

377
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,876
I'm not comfortable
taking your money.

378
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,796
Money?

379
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,192
We've been through this.
Nobody's giving us any money.

380
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,713
-Why can't they work together?
-Erica.

381
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,349
It's all right.

382
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,509
Leo, I hope everything
works out for you...

383
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,478
and you'll be around.

384
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,189
Maybe you'll learn something.

385
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,915
I really hope so.

386
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,791
Good.

387
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,075
Okay. Good.

388
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,279
Clean plate club, okay?

389
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,948
Got the hot mustard there?
Got to have the hot mustard.

390
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,674
It's all here.

391
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,749
Erica.

392
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,030
What?

393
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,909
-I want to show you something.
-What?

394
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,194
What is it?

395
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,035
Open it.

396
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,149
Oh, Willie.

397
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,630
We'll tell everyone this week.

398
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,911
I want to make this right.

399
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,554
I love you.

400
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,075
Where we going?

401
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,631
To the Sunnyside Yards.

402
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,832
The guys are there waiting for us.

403
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,073
There's someone
I want you to meet.

404
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,319
What are we going to do there?

405
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,590
We take out our competitor's
trains.

406
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,910
Short their stuff, makes
sure it don't work.

407
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,154
They get his as unreliable,
we get the jobs.

408
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,758
Tonight it's Weltech's trains.

409
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,433
The guys we had the run-in
with at Borough Hall.

410
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,759
Stand back and watch tonight.

411
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,753
Everything'll be all right.

412
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,477
-Boys, what's going on?
-What's up, Dante?

413
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,795
-What's going on?
-Hey, Todd.

414
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,115
Hey, Leo.

415
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,513
Raymond, that's Leo.

416
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,838
-How you doing?
-How you doing?

417
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,631
Good.

418
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,996
He's coming with me
to make a drop.

419
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,191
You ever in Local
One or Three?

420
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,475
No.

421
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,032
We don't deal with construction.

422
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,551
I don't know nothing about that.

423
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,274
You're here because your
friends clear you.

424
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,439
We're going down.

425
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,716
Leo, stay here.

426
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,033
-Make sure nobody comes down.
-Okay, I'll hang right here.

427
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,912
Got you those Knicks tickets.

428
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,239
This if for you.

429
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,149
I don't want it.

430
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,272
Get your guys off the tracks.

431
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,509
What?

432
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,233
You're out.

433
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,077
What?

434
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,113
Weltech come last week and
put 2 K right here.

435
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,231
And they got the muscle
to back it up.

436
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,873
You know how this works.

437
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,150
You get a better offer,
you come back at us.

438
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,475
Not anymore.

439
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,468
Electric Rail's going under,
and Weltech matches any offer.

440
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,116
Get them off the track, I got
the cops coming down here.

441
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,035
Keep going!

442
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,915
Come on, Elliot.

443
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,754
You wouldn't do this to me.

444
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,235
What are you doing?

445
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,515
Jump!

446
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,675
Willie!

447
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,910
Will

448
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,555
What are you doing?

449
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,710
-Nothing.
-What do you mean nothing?

450
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,830
You a troublemaker?
I ought to crack your fuckin' head.

451
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,548
Turn that off.

452
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,192
-What you gonna do?
-Turn that...

453
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,753
fuckin' thing off.

454
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,995
I'm talking to you.

455
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,989
You got some ID?

456
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,914
Don't fucking do it.

457
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,993
Put your hands up.
Turn around.

458
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,791
-You motherfucker!
-I didn't do nothing!

459
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,356
You want to run? I ought to
break you down, motherfucker.

460
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,114
-Hello?
-Mrs. Handler.

461
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,719
Is Leo there?

462
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,996
I'm here, Ma, you can hang up.

463
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,875
Leo

464
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,754
-I didn't mean to do it.
-Willie, what happened?

465
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,996
-You said everything'd be okay.
-I know..

466
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,918
Everything got fucked up.

467
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,758
Did anyone see you?
What didyou do?

468
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,952
A cop come down and beat
me on my fucking head.

469
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,516
-You okay?
-Yeah, but the cop...

470
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,471
All right, we can'tpanic.

471
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,150
I'll talk to Frank, he'll
know what to do.

472
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,634
Don't worry, Leo.

473
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,115
The borough can't afford
an investigation.

474
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,437
The fucking politicians are in
on it. You understand?

475
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,395
I understand.

476
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,395
Willie?

477
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,430
Hey.

478
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,432
I didn't know you
were here tonight.

479
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,389
I had to get out of
the fucking house.

480
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,675
Who's that?

481
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,197
-Who is it?
-Raymond.

482
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,673
What the fuck happened?

483
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,390
I can't talk now.
Get the guys.

484
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,478
We'll meet back at the
office tonight. All right?

485
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,468
Is that blood?

486
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,157
It's nothing.
I cut myself.

487
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,236
Go on.

488
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,434
-Who was that?
-Someone from work.

489
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,430
-Now?
-Don't worry. Go back to sleep.

490
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,709
Hello?

491
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,509
Hold on.

492
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,756
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

493
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,198
-Yeah?
-You had trouble this morning?

494
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,473
-Who is this?
-The yardmasteris dead.

495
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,150
And that cop may
not make it either.

496
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,793
Hector, is that you?

497
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,391
You come forward.
Weltech has very good lawyers.

498
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,918
Don't call here again.

499
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,517
What does everybody want?

500
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,351
I'm sorry, it's so crazy.

501
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,517
I didn't know you'd be there.

502
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,468
I can't wait till we get married.

503
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,039
I'll tell my mother...

504
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,919
and we'll get married.

505
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,276
We going to have a
whole family.

506
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,516
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

507
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,228
I'm tired.

508
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,313
You got a meeting.

509
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,357
We already got enough
problems with the minorities.

510
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,515
Conglomerates defense lose
contracts, they're back in trains.

511
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,950
We understand, but there's
nothing we can do now.

512
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,196
I'm getting squeezed
from all sides.

513
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,756
You got conglomerates taking
the work from the top.

514
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,918
Minorities get the bottom work.
I'm squeezed in the middle.

515
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,269
Frank, take it easy.

516
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,550
-Wait till after the election.
-Why after?

517
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,320
After this election,
the next election.

518
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,358
Be patient, Frank.

519
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,312
You listen to me.

520
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,639
You got to kill those minority
quotas or I'm out of business.

521
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,829
It's that simple.

522
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,917
It's too hot for us right now.
This...

523
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,998
killing in the yards.
Where's that going to go?

524
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,795
-You know anything, Frank?
-No. But if it were...

525
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,275
one of my guys,
I'd kill them.

526
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,199
That cop's still alive, Frank.
He's in a coma.

527
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,749
If he pulls through...

528
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,679
and it turns out to be the
business, hell will break loose.

529
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,872
The cops'll be all over us.
No way we could control it.

530
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,917
Can't do anything for me
and the quotas?

531
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,111
-Times are changing.
-Who is it?

532
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,878
-It's me.
-Hey, Willie.

533
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,868
What do you need?

534
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,353
I want to talk to you.

535
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,593
I'm very busy right now.

536
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,238
It's no big deal.
I can take care of it.

537
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,468
All right.

538
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,796
Good.

539
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,512
I'm telling you my company's
in serious trouble.

540
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,668
A Metropolitan Community
Transit workeris dead...

541
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,758
and a cop is in a coma
aftera pre-dawn attack...

542
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,030
at the Sunnyside Yards
in Queens.

543
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,199
OfficerRifkin responded to
an alarm call at the yards...

544
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,032
just after 1:00 this morning.

545
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,876
10 minutes later, backup units
discovered OfficerRifkin...

546
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,911
face down and unconscious.

547
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,749
The body ofyardmasterElliot
Gorwitz was also found...

548
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,435
bled to death from a
single stab wound.

549
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,109
Gorwitz had worked for
the M.C. T. for 14 years.

550
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,473
Queens borough presidentArthur
Mydanick was shocked...

551
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,113
and saddened by the incident.

552
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,231
Ofcourse I was very upset
over this.

553
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,396
We won't stand for these attacks.

554
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,716
Finding the assailants is
at the top ofouragenda.

555
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,796
OfficerRifkin remains in
critical condition...

556
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,070
andpolice are still without
a suspect.

557
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,995
I need milk.

558
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,111
-I'll get it, Aunt Val.
-Thanks, honey.

559
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,958
-You still go to Waldbaum's?
-Yeah, sometimes.

560
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,155
-Loe, is that for you?
-Yeah, I got it, Ma.

561
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,435
What's going on?

562
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,639
We got to talk.
The guys are downstairs.

563
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,957
-Let me get my jacket.
-Willie!

564
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,718
We're having cake.
Come in.

565
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,229
Thank you, Mrs. Handler.
I can't right now.

566
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,714
Erica's here.

567
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,480
-Won't you come in?
-Come on in.

568
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,678
I didn't know you were here.

569
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,435
Yep.

570
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,949
Hi.

571
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,275
-Hi, Mrs. Olchin.
-You look handsome tonight.

572
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,029
Thank you.

573
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,119
-Excuse me, I got to run.
-No, Willie, come here.

574
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,113
-Hey, baby...
-Come here.

575
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,109
Ma.

576
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,239
Willie and me...

577
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,152
talked about getting married.

578
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,989
-When did this happen?
-We talked...

579
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,235
Iast night.

580
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,193
What about school?

581
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,919
I'm still going to finish.

582
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,956
That a very big step.
Don't you think we should...

583
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,033
discuss it?

584
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,597
Will, is that them?

585
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,751
Yeah.

586
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,789
No, thanks.

587
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,793
I really got to go.

588
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,316
I didn't know we were
going to get into this.

589
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,557
I think we should discuss it.

590
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,192
Will, they're waiting.

591
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,035
Sorry.

592
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,477
Let's go.

593
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,035
Hey, Leo.

594
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,592
I got a call from Weltech.
That guy Hector.

595
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,118
They heard about what happened.

596
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,270
The want to offer me protection
if I talk to their lawyers.

597
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,791
They'd do anything
to get Frank.

598
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,152
Don't you fucking
turn on me, Willie.

599
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,272
Of course not.
I hung up on the fucking guy.

600
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,948
I'm just saying...

601
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,954
we got to stay tight here.
Listen to what the guys say.

602
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,879
Just listen to what
they have to say.

603
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,110
We're in a very tough
situation.

604
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,552
-What's p, Todd?
-What's going on?

605
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,909
Get in the back.

606
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,872
That cop you hit?

607
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,117
He's a fucking problem.

608
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,831
Ifhe wakes up,
we're all in trouble.

609
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,716
We don't know whatyou'd
do to stay out ofjail.

610
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,558
-I wouldn't fuck you.
-Yeah...

611
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,069
but you get caught
now, and it's life.

612
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,438
Will, you know I
wouldn't do that.

613
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,234
What happened? I thought
you'd talk to Frank.

614
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,231
Frank's got no pull
with the police.

615
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,909
He's on the 4th floor at
Booth Memorial.

616
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,792
4 beds to a room.

617
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,828
Todd's friend's an orderly,
he works night shift.

618
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,109
He'll get you in.

619
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,274
They got one officer
in front of the ward.

620
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,472
He's on an 8-hour shift.

621
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,399
Wait till he takes a leak...

622
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,919
then go inside.

623
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,393
The guy's a fucking cop.

624
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,558
Nobody wants this, Leo.

625
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,558
It's the only thing we can do.

626
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,079
I don't know if I could.

627
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,919
You think about it.

628
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,396
The only thing that
cop saw was you.

629
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,793
If you can't take care of this,
we got to take care of it.

630
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,038
We're not going after that
cop, you understand?

631
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,317
You guys wait here.
Todd's gonna talk to this guy.

632
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,389
Come on.

633
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,309
Leo...

634
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,391
if anything happens...

635
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,319
if anything goes wrong...

636
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,273
you run.

637
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,037
And get the fuck out of the city.

638
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,312
I'll look in on your mother.

639
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,751
I feel like I'm gonna fucking die.

640
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,634
Come on, man.
My break's almost over.

641
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,192
Don't you fucking back out.

642
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,671
Well, now.
How are we feeling?

643
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,950
I called your family, Jerry.
They're coming.

644
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,398
You were out cold for a while.

645
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,668
Get some rest.

646
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,719
You deserve some rest.

647
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,119
-What happened?
-Motherfucker ran away!

648
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,750
Your friend is fucking dead,
Willie! You hear me?

649
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,153
-What's wrong?
-He didn't come home last night...

650
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,475
from work.

651
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,998
-What happened?
-I don't know.

652
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,479
He missed his parole meeting.
They called for him.

653
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,478
Said he's in violation.

654
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,479
He's in violation.

655
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,910
All right, sit down.
Calm down.

656
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,599
Yeah, but what if...?

657
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,959
What if something happens?

658
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,637
-Val, listen to me.
-Yeah.

659
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,389
You're my sister. I love you
and can't let this kill you.

660
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,315
You hear me?

661
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,470
Okay, gentlemen, right in here.

662
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,633
All the way down the tracks.

663
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,590
Take your pictures of our circuit
in the train signal boxes.

664
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,277
Build them to the specs.

665
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,954
Preference will be given
to minority companies...

666
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,798
for a portion of contracts.

667
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,799
-Think about what I said.
-Get off me.

668
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,876
You want to help out?

669
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,275
I wouldn't bother with
a bid on this one.

670
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,149
What are you talking about?

671
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,191
Word from the inspector general.

672
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,278
The cop that was hit
came up with a suspect.

673
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,516
It's your nephew.

674
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,231
I'm sorry to have to tell you.

675
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,950
-You'll get caught.
-Shut the fuck up.

676
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,392
You'll be the first to go.

677
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,355
Come on!

678
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,118
Knock it off! Settle down!
What's the matter with you?

679
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,514
Why didn'tyou tell me?

680
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,438
We were going to handle
it on our own.

681
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,312
You fucking idiot!

682
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,472
This could be devastating.

683
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,308
The borough connects us,
we're out of business.

684
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,314
-We could all go to jail.
-I shouldn't have let him go.

685
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,919
Accident waiting to happen.

686
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,793
It's going to be all right.
Leo's gone.

687
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,072
Nobody knows he was
working for us.

688
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,191
They won't stop investigating.

689
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,119
You think there's a statue
of limits for murder?

690
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,475
Who killed the yardmaster?
Was it Leo?

691
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,393
I understand.
Trying to protect your friend.

692
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,394
We have to distance ourselves
from your nephew.

693
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,875
Say he never worked here.

694
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,277
I'll make sure the accountants
didn't file any W-2s.

695
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,238
I'll also put out a statement.

696
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,518
"We're all saddened by
the turn of events." Etc.

697
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,358
None of that's going to hold.

698
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,030
It's going to lead back to us.

699
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,437
We got to talk to this cop.

700
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,195
See what it takes for him
to remember differently.

701
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,869
Tonight's the president's party.
I'll talk to Seymour...

702
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,517
see if it's something
we could pursue.

703
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,713
I thought I could help.

704
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,679
I thought I was gonna help him.

705
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,149
I'm sorry.

706
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,119
-Are you waiting for them?
-We're always waiting.

707
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,035
Hello?

708
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,833
-Hey, Bernie.
-Hey.

709
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,995
How you doing?

710
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,356
-What? We ready?
-We'll be right down.

711
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,390
Right down?

712
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,435
What's the problem?

713
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,310
-Is Willie downstairs?
- Yeah.

714
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:18,831
Well?

715
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,431
They're thinking of
getting married.

716
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,676
I don't want to talk
about it with him.

717
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,753
He's not my father.

718
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,632
Your mother looks very upset.

719
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,951
Don't you think you
should discuss it?

720
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,719
Could you get the fuck out?

721
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,273
-Hey!
-It's all right.

722
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,437
You do what you want to do.

723
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,593
You want to upset your
mother? Go ahead.

724
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,198
You want to run into this
without thinking about it?

725
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,120
You do that.
But get ready.

726
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,349
Get ready.

727
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,789
Thank you.

728
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,509
Sweetie?

729
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,588
Harriet, how are you?
Let's wish Arthur a happy birthday.

730
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,791
-You wanna come?
-I've said enough.

731
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,149
Probably.

732
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,837
There he is.

733
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,828
-Hey, Manny.
-Hey.

734
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,314
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

735
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,475
Good.

736
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,477
Arthur.

737
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,558
I don't think he heard you.

738
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,551
They got some nice
roast beef over there.

739
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,433
You guys sit down.
I'll join you in a minute.

740
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,629
All right.

741
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,230
I try to say hello to Art, he
gives me the cold shoulder.

742
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,671
-He can't be seen with you.
-He embarrassed me.

743
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,310
You know how much money
I gave to his campaign?

744
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,511
Wait till things calm down.

745
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,831
What do you know
about this cop?

746
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,235
The one that's giving
us the hassle.

747
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,590
They say he's pretty sure
about his suspect.

748
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,631
-How sure?
-I don't know.

749
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,069
What are you trying to say?

750
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,033
I thought maybe we...

751
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,715
could create a little
fund for him.

752
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,672
He was hit in the head and...

753
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,271
maybe don't remember so good.

754
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,239
-I'll do a little digging.
-Good. You do that.

755
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,993
We want to help him out.

756
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,838
And before this investigation
gets out of hand.

757
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,077
Come on!

758
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,510
-Don't move!
-Warrant service, ma'am.

759
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,712
-Where's your son. Is he here?
-No. What are you doing?

760
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,911
We got a warrant for his arrest.

761
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,711
Ma'am?
You all right?

762
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,070
He's not here. Please!

763
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,030
Over here, Joe.

764
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,275
Ma'am.

765
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,559
Looks like chest pains.

766
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,153
Toss it all out! Come on!

767
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,910
Check it for weapons!

768
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,315
She's having problems.
Call paramedics.

769
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,713
OfficerRifkin will soon
be on his way home.

770
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,434
Rifkin, who was injured
in an attack at the...

771
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,757
Sunnyside Rail Yards of
Queens has recovered.

772
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,389
He has given police
theirfirst lead in their...

773
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,591
search forhis assailant
and killerof...

774
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,392
an M.C. T. yardmaster.

775
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,238
Afterreviewing police
mug books...

776
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,998
Rifkin identified...

777
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,875
24-year-old ex-convict Leo
Handleras his assailant.

778
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,192
Although police believe he
may have fled the state...

779
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,198
they are asking anyone
with information to...

780
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,311
contact them immediately.

781
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,148
Coming up, "Where were you
when the lights went out?"

782
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,556
-Hello?
-It's me, Will.

783
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,155
Leo.

784
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,189
Where are you?

785
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,989
You okay?

786
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,837
They're blaming me for
things I didn't do.

787
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,514
That ain't right.
I can't go nowhere.

788
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,188
-I can talk to nobody.
-I'm worry, l...

789
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,911
There's nothing I can do
right now.

790
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,350
-When can I come back?
-Leo...

791
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,069
you got to stay away
fora little longer.

792
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,713
How's my mother?

793
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,638
Her phone's probably tapped.

794
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,274
Didyou see her?

795
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,915
Willie?

796
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,155
Yeah, I did.

797
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,869
Is she okay?

798
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,315
-She'll be all right.
-What's wrong?

799
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,236
No, nothing.

800
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,154
The family's with her
and she's okay.

801
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,908
I can hear it in your
fucking voice.

802
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,269
No, listen.

803
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,908
Leo, listen, calm down.

804
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,276
I can't talk right now.
But...

805
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,756
call me back in
a couple ofweeks.

806
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,076
And...

807
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,834
Frank's trying tow work
everything out.

808
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,270
Leo?

809
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,235
You there?

810
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,835
Yeah, all right.

811
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,712
Is your mother up there?

812
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,594
What are you doing here?

813
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,913
Want to get caught?

814
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,595
-Police were here.
-I know.

815
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,078
I've been watching them.

816
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,719
I'll go around the back.

817
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,035
Let me in.

818
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,909
Go ahead.

819
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,034
I need to see her.

820
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,195
Ma.

821
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,790
Ma, you up?

822
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,114
How you feeling?

823
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,637
I just come to see you.

824
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,189
Ma.

825
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,351
I know I'm not the son you wanted.

826
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,599
And I promised myself...

827
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,029
I'd do whatever I could
to fit in.

828
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,474
What happened before,
I know I did wrong.

829
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,999
But I didn't do what
they're saying I did.

830
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,514
I know I'll...

831
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,549
never be able to redeem myself.

832
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,718
I just wanted you to know...

833
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,272
it wasn't me, Mom.

834
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,268
I just wanted to see
how she was doing.

835
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,995
Leo.

836
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,793
Was Willie with you?

837
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,194
At the yards?

838
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,677
It wasn't him, was it?

839
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,878
You've got to be strong now.

840
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,872
I know you guys had plans.

841
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,196
We got to find a way
through this.

842
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,918
We're going to get through this.

843
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,549
Come on.

844
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,033
Thanks for looking after her.

845
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,470
Yeah.

846
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,231
I'll come back tomorrow.
Get the doctor to see her.

847
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,151
Mr. Olchin, sorry to
interrupt your meeting.

848
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,839
-I'm Detective Tommasino.
-How you doing?

849
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,951
-Detective Bulette.
-What can I do for you?

850
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,720
Look at this. I want to
ask you a few questions.

851
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,640
-Yeah.
-Do you know his whereabouts?

852
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,796
I only met him a couple
of times.

853
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,237
Wife says he's a troubled kid.

854
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,316
He's not in your employ?

855
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,235
Oh, no.

856
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,829
Your secretary said
he came to see you.

857
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,510
He was looking for a job,
but I didn't have anything.

858
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,078
Will you contact us if you
gain any information?

859
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,633
Sure, absolutely.

860
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,512
-Thank you for your time.
-Thank you.

861
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,631
Thanks.

862
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,311
Seymour, what'd you find out?

863
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,559
They'll be a hearing on
thatyardmaster who got killed.

864
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,919
Something else, Frank.

865
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,990
I talked to the division
captain last night.

866
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,714
He says there's no way.

867
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,592
The cop is straight. No
chance he'll go under the table.

868
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,394
Can't Mydanick help us
out here?

869
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,796
Help?
The kid's a murderer.

870
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,553
What'd the cops say to you?

871
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,280
What do you think?
They're looking for him.

872
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,270
Maybe you should get him
before they do.

873
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,835
-What?
-Make sure he doesn't turn up.

874
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,192
What are we talking about?

875
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,392
What do you think I am?

876
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,116
I'm saying this is
real priority for...

877
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,311
the borough president right now.

878
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,235
He doesn't want us to
end up like Donnie Manes.

879
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,269
Yeah, well...

880
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,388
you'll have to think
of something else.

881
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,592
I can't do nothing like that.

882
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,595
Fucking kid is in
my family.

883
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,678
Make sure he don't turn up.

884
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,757
-Anything we can do, Dr.?
-I have her on Digoxin.

885
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,350
-So we'll watch.
-I need your number.

886
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,397
Take care.
Hi, Mrs. Olchin.

887
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,669
Hey, sweetheart.

888
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,359
Your brother said
you'd be here.

889
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,915
-I've been calling all day.
-Ma.

890
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,072
I'll go inside.

891
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,669
Where you been?

892
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,869
I been here.

893
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,915
I know that.

894
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,632
How come you didn't call me back?

895
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,077
There's a lot going on now.

896
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,517
Your mother got a problem with me?

897
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,758
I don't know. No.

898
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,558
I saw how she looked when
you said we'd get married.

899
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,508
You should go.

900
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,517
No, I want to talk to you.

901
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,672
I don't have anything to say.

902
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,715
Erica?

903
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,030
Is this because of what
happened with Leo?

904
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,755
'Cause...

905
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,270
-I'm going back inside.
-Wait, I want to talk to you.

906
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,676
Erica, listen. Erica!

907
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,355
I got a hearing coming
up with the city.

908
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,869
I'd be nice if you came
with me for support.

909
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,875
Okay.

910
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,079
How's your sister?

911
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,439
What's the matter, honey?

912
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,712
I saw Leo tonight,
outside the apartment.

913
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,913
You saw Leo tonight.

914
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,029
He's going to get all
of us into trouble.

915
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,037
You said he wasn't coming back.

916
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,039
I was there tonight.

917
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,950
-He was there?
-Yeah, he was there.

918
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,790
We've got to deal with
it right now.

919
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,468
What do you want me to do?

920
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,198
My wife is...

921
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,948
very upset.

922
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,036
Erica's been spending a lot
of time there with Leo.

923
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,956
She doesn't like them
being together...

924
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,795
because of what happened
between them.

925
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,389
What do you mean?

926
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,349
You don't know?

927
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,915
She caught them together
when they were 1 5.

928
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,154
I never knew.

929
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,754
I found some letters
from him to her but...

930
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,759
I never thought that...

931
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,194
I wish...

932
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,555
there was some way
to take care of this.

933
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,475
What are you doing here?

934
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,595
Willie?

935
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,271
I just came to see my mother.

936
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,279
To see your mother?

937
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,159
You're not supposed
to be here.

938
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,755
He went to the roof to
see if it was safe.

939
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,915
Shut up.

940
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,839
Why'd you come back?

941
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,079
You fucked everything up.

942
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,275
Willie, what the fuck?

943
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,155
What the fuck are you doing?

944
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,474
What the fuck's wrong with you?

945
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,629
Let me go.

946
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,474
You fucking...

947
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,229
Come on.

948
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,278
-Come on, Will.
-Fucker!

949
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,072
-Come on!
-Motherfucker!

950
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,269
You motherfucker!

951
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,870
It's over, Will. No more.

952
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,313
You fucked me, Will!

953
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,589
You fucked me.

954
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,589
Frank?

955
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,796
Jesus, what happened to you?

956
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,238
Your mother see you like that?

957
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,274
I know I haven't always given
you as much respect as I should.

958
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:36,390
I haven't give you a chance to
be a father to me and my brother.

959
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,354
And I'm sorry.

960
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,437
I know what that means to you,
how hard you've tried.

961
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,717
But I hope you can
forgive me.

962
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,717
It's been hard for me too.

963
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,471
I loved my father very much.

964
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,475
We were very close as a family.

965
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,191
That's why I'm asking you now.

966
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,113
Leo needs your help.

967
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,959
He wants to see you.

968
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,753
I told him you would.

969
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,029
Please.

970
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:43,955
Please.

971
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,948
Where is he?

972
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,314
I could take you.

973
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,634
Go out to the car.

974
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,429
Leo?

975
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,914
Yeah, over here.

976
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,190
You been causing me
a lot of difficulty.

977
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,113
Police been coming to see me.

978
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,193
I need you to help me.

979
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,239
What is it I can do?

980
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,279
I really don't know.

981
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,751
Talk to people you know.
I didn't kill anybody.

982
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,319
Do you know who did?

983
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,395
I...

984
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,071
wish I could help you.
I really do.

985
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,390
But I got to protect
what I've built.

986
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,874
For my family.

987
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,834
Because that's all I got left.

988
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:48,995
Leo.

989
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:39,989
Leo.

990
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,078
Take care of yourself.

991
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,189
I can't stay. Too many
people know I'm here.

992
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,713
They're all against me.

993
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,749
I know.

994
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,114
I'm sorry it was always
just the two of us.

995
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,274
Always having to deal
with everything ourselves.

996
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,835
I never needed nobody
else anyway.

997
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,789
You never had...

998
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,277
someone to look up to.

999
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,319
I used to look at those
business people...

1000
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,193
going to the city.

1001
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,876
I always hoped you
could be one of them.

1002
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,515
You'd look good in
one of those suits.

1003
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,915
Yeah, but...

1004
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,198
who knows what they do.

1005
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,508
I love you, Ma.

1006
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,353
Don't lose faith.

1007
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,516
I'll stay a little longer tonight.

1008
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,835
Okay.

1009
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,314
I'm going to be good.

1010
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,591
I'll get the rest of my things.

1011
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,675
Ma.

1012
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:01,950
Ma.

1013
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,275
I got to take you to
the neighbor's now.

1014
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,396
Tell Willie I know he sent you.

1015
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,393
Tell him to start looking
over his fuckin' back.

1016
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,431
Hey!

1017
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,508
Look at me.

1018
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,236
I could get every one
of you fucking guys.

1019
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,038
I could. I'm going to.

1020
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,476
Don't. Don't.

1021
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,189
Please!

1022
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,149
Get up!

1023
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,755
-Get the fuck out of here!
-Did you do it?

1024
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:50,949
Go!

1025
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,312
Hundreds ofcity residents are
expected at a public hearing...

1026
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,080
to discuss charges of
corruption andpayoffs...

1027
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,633
in the consumer
rail industry.

1028
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,035
Mydanick called the meeting
amid criticism...

1029
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,915
his office isn't doing enough
to resolve this scandal.

1030
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,709
It may lead to the indictment
oflocalpoliticians...

1031
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,319
and rail executives.

1032
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,995
The controversy was sparked
last month when...

1033
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,713
Elliot Gorwitz was killed...

1034
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,956
and officer Gerald Rifkin
was injured...

1035
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,390
in the attack at the
Sunnyside Yards.

1036
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,910
There's been protests
including a demonstration...

1037
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,190
in Manhattan that
turned violent.

1038
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,710
29 people were arrested for
assault and disorderly conduct.

1039
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,116
Meanwhile, police are
looking forLeo Handler...

1040
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,629
the only suspect in
the Gorwitz murder.

1041
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,950
Frank is very concerned, Willie.
I just talked to him.

1042
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,709
He asked me to find out
how it went.

1043
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,628
We had a little...

1044
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,589
problem...

1045
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,996
but we'll go back again.

1046
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,039
You got this under control?

1047
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,670
What...what time's the hearing?

1048
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,758
I don't know if you'll be coming.

1049
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,672
-Why not?
-Frank and l...

1050
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:29,270
discussed it. We don't think it's
a good idea for you to come.

1051
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,672
Because of the investigation.

1052
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,433
Frank doesn't think I should?

1053
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,194
You know how it is.

1054
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,710
Yeah.

1055
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,430
He also wanted me
to tell you that he...

1056
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,916
doesn't want you
calling the house.

1057
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,429
And you got the
house keys, right?

1058
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,630
Yeah.

1059
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,948
He wants them back.

1060
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,316
Okay?

1061
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,477
Well, I don't have them
on me right now.

1062
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,156
That's all right.

1063
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,952
Drop them off as soon as you can.

1064
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,515
He's a little worried
about security.

1065
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,589
See you later, Willie.

1066
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,709
-Hello. Weltech.
-Hector Gallardo, please.

1067
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,353
Just a minute, please.

1068
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,318
-Hello?
-Hector, it's Willie Gutierrez.

1069
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,229
You're too late.

1070
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,431
The purpose is to let things
air, give people a voice...

1071
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,914
and announce our investigation.

1072
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,431
Any more quotes you'll get
later. Hold that for me.

1073
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,675
Seymour.

1074
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,593
-Hi, Frank.
-How you been?

1075
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,074
-Fine.
-Good.

1076
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,194
Move one over.

1077
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,997
-You speak to Willie?
-Yeah.

1078
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,870
He's still taking care
of the problem.

1079
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,677
You won't have to worry.
I told him to keep his distance.

1080
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,513
Where's Sequiera?

1081
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,949
I haven't seen him.

1082
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,837
He and the Weltech people want
to make a big entrance.

1083
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,953
That's enough, thank you.

1084
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:50,909
Thank you.

1085
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,753
Frank, turn around.

1086
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,636
My God, what's he doing here?

1087
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:33,273
He is willing to turn himself
in after these proceedings.

1088
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,879
You have my assurances.

1089
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,517
Tell the borough we
need to talk now.

1090
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,398
And I want Mydanick. Make sure
he understands I want him.

1091
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,159
Let's make this quick.

1092
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,393
We got a new problem out there.

1093
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,153
What do you mean "we"?

1094
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,874
He's your nephew.

1095
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:10,915
You're on your own, Frank.

1096
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,631
You throwing me to the wolves?

1097
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,832
I got records and copies of
every check that went to you...

1098
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,952
that bought your fuckin
house in Sands Point.

1099
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,278
So let's not play games.

1100
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,272
What are you talking about?

1101
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,633
There was a murder.

1102
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,833
A man lost his life.

1103
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,436
You can't bargain
with a man's life.

1104
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,752
And this man over here...

1105
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,076
has been wrongly accused
of the crime.

1106
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,599
Okay, all right, look.

1107
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,438
Why are you telling me this?

1108
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,198
You're talking about my nephew.

1109
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,314
I'm going to do everything
I can to help. So now...

1110
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,758
think we can agree on something
that would make everybody happy?

1111
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,108
I don't know, Frank.

1112
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:36,356
Your nephew...

1113
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,199
has a lot to say about your
conducts in business.

1114
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,389
Everybody out there has
a right to hear it.

1115
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,476
Manny, come on.

1116
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,472
What good is that going to do?

1117
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,388
Can't we resolve this nice?

1118
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,749
I don't think you understand.

1119
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,875
We have been kept down by this
man and his people a long time.

1120
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,719
It's about time for a little
retribution. Don't you think so?

1121
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,589
Hello?

1122
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,639
What are you doing here?

1123
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,716
Came to drop off the keys.

1124
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,838
-Thought you'd be at the hearing.
-I was at school.

1125
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,956
If you're looking for Leo,
I don't know where he is.

1126
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,678
I'm not looking for Leo.

1127
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,719
I know where he is.

1128
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,556
Artie, Seymour said you
wanted to see me.

1129
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,792
Yeah, come in, Sal.

1130
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,957
This is Deputy Chief Disipio
from Police Plaza.

1131
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,593
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

1132
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,076
We got a problem.
We're hoping you can help.

1133
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,759
Anything for you, Artie.

1134
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,552
Well, we all think...

1135
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,320
your Officer Rifkin out
there's a little confused.

1136
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,909
-Is that right?
-Yeah, that's right.

1137
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,154
This young man here...

1138
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,913
is not your guy.

1139
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,155
Look, Sal...

1140
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,631
we understand the suffering
Rifkin has been through.

1141
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,149
We're willing to compensate
him for it.

1142
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:18,509
We'd present you with
the remuneration and...

1143
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,629
you could distribute it...

1144
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,798
however you see fit.

1145
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,469
So...

1146
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,874
-you've been wrongly accused?
-Yes, I have.

1147
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,750
I can help with that murder.
I know who did it.

1148
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,229
Oh, yeah?

1149
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,552
You'd be willing
to testify to that?

1150
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:40,312
Yes, I will.
I would definitely.

1151
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,152
I think we might be...

1152
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,271
able to solve a lot
of your problems.

1153
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,152
Rifkin is supposed to
be by-the-book.

1154
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,799
He can be a hard-ass...

1155
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,833
but he can get carried away
with the nightstick.

1156
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,918
And you and I know he won't
want that to come out.

1157
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,631
Manny...

1158
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,273
it's really up to you now.

1159
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,833
I just want 20%

1160
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,398
Of all the contracts.

1161
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,189
Yeah.

1162
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,235
That's fair.

1163
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:20,879
I guess that's fair.

1164
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,479
Leo was smart.

1165
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,116
He did what I should have done.

1166
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,913
It's a little late for that now.

1167
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,438
I'm sure you'll be okay.

1168
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:40,916
Yeah?

1169
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,833
-Everyone's trying to cut me out.
-I can't help.

1170
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,068
Erica, wait.

1171
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,188
Erica, wait!

1172
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:56,875
Willie, stop!

1173
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,399
I love you, Erica.

1174
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,514
I'm so sorry.

1175
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,232
Don't run away from me, please.

1176
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,593
You're all I have now.

1177
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,032
I love you so much.

1178
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,835
Where you going?

1179
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:41,357
Come here.

1180
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,271
You going to see fucking Leo?

1181
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,037
You know how sick that is?
How fucking sick?

1182
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,275
No!

1183
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:56,755
No!

1184
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,989
No!

1185
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,156
No!

1186
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,119
Just leave me alone!

1187
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,598
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1188
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,473
Deputy Chief Disipio
and honored members...

1189
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,313
of our police force.

1190
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,113
I want you all to know...

1191
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,629
that I have demanded an
internal investigation...

1192
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,308
unprecedented in scope and rigor.

1193
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:40,590
I know things can divide us here
in this borough and community...

1194
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,475
but your showing up tonight
indicates confidence in our system.

1195
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,870
Our internal investigation,
which will be aired next week...

1196
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,913
will show the claims
of concerned citizens...

1197
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,872
as well as some of our media...

1198
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,958
are totally unfounded.

1199
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,317
Our investigation concludes...

1200
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,474
the suspect we have been
following for some time...

1201
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,836
should be cleared of all charges.

1202
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,715
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

1203
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,194
Excuse me, sir?

1204
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,396
We have a report of an alarm.

1205
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,558
Can I see your license,
registration and insurance, please?

1206
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:01,995
Sir?

1207
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:07,755
Get out of the car.

1208
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,393
Get out of the car!

1209
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,270
-Go call for backup.
-You got it.

1210
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,919
What were you doing in there?

1211
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:18,675
Got anything on you?

1212
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,917
Ourreport, which will be
made public next week...

1213
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,950
will show we have a great deal
of violence in our subways.

1214
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,596
We've made an unfailing
commitment to...

1215
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,394
our transportation system.
We cannot let...

1216
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,956
violence tearat the fabric
ofourgreat city.

1217
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,958
Ourhearts go out to the
family ofMr. Gorwitz.

1218
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,754
Mr. Gorwitz's murder
is a true tragedy.

1219
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:50,277
We have show time and again
that we can come together.

1220
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,352
As I look around the
room this evening...

1221
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,233
-I see that we...
-Mr. and Mrs. Olchin?

1222
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,590
-Could you come with us, please?
-What's the matter?

1223
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,633
It's about your daughter.

1224
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:02,269
I'm very sorry.

1225
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,313
She was found in your house.

1226
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,228
She was deceased.

1227
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,839
I'm very sorry.

1228
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,679
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

1229
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,629
Mom!

1230
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:36,428
Ladies and gentlemen,
just take your seats, please.

1231
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,512
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

1232
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,149
Leo.

1233
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,229
Look...

1234
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,232
I just want to tell you...

1235
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:46,956
you got nothing to
worry about because...

1236
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,231
I got friends.

1237
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:52,111
And they can protect us.

1238
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,388
I heard rumors people
people for the Attorney...

1239
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,239
General's office want
to talk to you...

1240
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,671
but you can't lose your head.
Just stick with us.

1241
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,714
And in the future...

1242
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,352

1244
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,512
Your mother needs you.

1245
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:55,915
Come on.

1246
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,431
I am not an importantperson.

1247
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,794
Mypurpose today is to
shed some light on...

1248
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,468
my experience in
a corrupt system.

1249
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,237
I know I have made my own
mistakes through time...

1250
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,068
but I have paid my debts
to society.

1251
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:22,870
I hope today to re-enter
the community...

1252
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,559
as a productive citizen.

1253
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,119
That is all I want.

1254
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,989
That is all I ever wanted.
Thank you.

1255
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:33,354
We thank you for
your courageousness...

1256
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,556
in coming forward this morning.

1257
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:37,514
I will now ask you...

1258
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,915
to read into the record, the
names of those individuals...

1259
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:43,751
who you contend are key
members of this conspiracy.

1260
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,471
Mr. Arthur C. Mydanick.

1261
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,118
Mr. Seymour Korman.

1262
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:56,591
Mr. Frank H. Olchin.

1263
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,716
Mr. Paul Lazarides.

1264
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,792
And Mr. Willie Gutierrez.

1265
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:09,953
I would like to finish...

1266
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:13,912
by saying that as a product
of my street environment...

1267
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:18,109
I am aware of the code of
silence I have just violated.

1268
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,798
But many lives have been
destroyed by this system...

1269
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,236
and I believe that
in years to come...

1270
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:27,113
my testimony will be
viewed for what it is...

1271
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,069
and that I will not have to
look back on this day...

1272
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,276
with any regret.
Thank you.

1272
01:43:32,276 --> 01:50:32,276
Ripped by Apophis!
