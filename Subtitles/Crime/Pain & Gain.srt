Hello, James Bond.

1047
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,043
Why so sad?

1048
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,880
I had to hurt a man today.

1049
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,502
- Wow.
- I didn't want to,

1050
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,208
'cause I like him.

1051
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,001
But he forced me to.

1052
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,548
Look, in your line of work,
people do get hurt.

1053

- Okay.
- Danny tells me I'm with you now.

Very good.

what you're talking about right now.

Oh, it's okay. I know who you are.

Well, you should, 'cause we've met.

1061

Tell me about the playing again?

1062
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,612

No, there shouldn't be a problem.

1105
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,250
It's just that
all of these transfer documents,

1106

they need to be witnessed
by a notary public.

He's out there trying
to impact the world in a positive way.

1132

No, that's the only reason for a notary,

1133
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,887
is that I have to
witness the signing of the document.

1134
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,348
Otherwise, somebody
could just come in off the street,

1135
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:38,184
forge somebody's signature
and take all their shit.

1136
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,314

No, you can't borrow my stamp.

But if you had to do it, you would adapt.

1166
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,517
You would reach down deep, right?

What do you mean, "reach down deep"?

What if I reach down
and there's nothing there?

01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,112
You better,
'cause right now your sister's

1547
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,367
stronger than you.
Give me your hand. Get up!

1548
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,165
What are you looking at,
you little chubby broad'?

1549
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,833
Don't eyeball me, boy. I see your mother

1550
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,160
driving up and down the street
looking at me.

1551
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,586
I'll be your stepfather in about a week.

1552
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,462
DANIEL: <i>I</i> love my new home,

1553
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,757
<i>my new neighborhood
and my little brat-pack crew.</i>

1554
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,300
<i>I kept it real with them
little motherfuckers</i>

1555
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,002
<i>and they kept it real with me.</i>

1556
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:55,432
(GRUNTS) That's 315, close grip.

1557
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,013
All right, benching builds your pecs.

1558
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,344
We got no homos in this gang, right?

1559
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:00,644
All right, good.
And if you bachelors like girls,

1560
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,972
listen to the Lawn Dawg.

1561
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,773
No hottie can resist dope pecs.

1562
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,065
You want to chase tail with me
in South Beach

1563
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,393
<i>on</i> my <i>Puppy Luv?</i> Huh?

1564
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,023
Or do you want to
look at your little nuts in the mirror

1565
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,103
and see if you got any peach fuzz?

1566
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,314
All right, good.

1567
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,489
Wow!

1568
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,909
DANIEL: Hey, guys. You like it?

1569
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,201
Yeah.

1570
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,779
Oh, I love the sexy <i>casa!</i>

-(LAUGHING)

1572

You guys like that?

1573
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,120
You like that fine Russian pussy?

1574
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,167
That was mine.

1575
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,415
I gave it to him. Like nothing.

1576
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,837
Now if we're gonna roll,
we're gonna chase tail,

1577
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,635
we got to do it my way, okay?

1578
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,338
No pickle-licking around here. Let's go.

1579
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,547
Break it off. Remind your folks

1580
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:37,757
about Neighborhood Watch, okay?

1581
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,888
You, you, you and you, jog it home.

1582
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:41,720
- All right, big man.
- ADRIAN: All right, brother.

1583
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:42,804
DANIEL: Let's race the Porsche, baby.

1584
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,472
PAUL: Let's do it.
DANIEL: Come on. It's money.

1585
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:45,932
(CAMERA CLICKING)

1586
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,276
You get the Turbo.

1587
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,032
ED: And this Adrian Doorbal,
he paid in cash?

1588
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,958
Yes. 100,000.

1589
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,414
- Cash?
- Cash.

1590
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,120
- This didn't surprise you.
- No.

1591
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,833
I thought maybe he was in sports, rap.

1592
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,041
You know, he is black.

1593
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:13,793
Yeah.

1594
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,337
Well, you don't think it was strange

1595
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,714
that Mr. Kershaw never said goodbye?

1596
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,300
WOMAN: He was a dick.
Always making fat jokes.

1597
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,560
One time he told me
if I can cut out snacking,

1598
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,682
that they can cure world hunger.

1599
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,805
Yeah, he can be kind of rude that way.

1600
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:27,811
What do you think of the new guy?

1601
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:31,986
Awesome. He says I'm a do-er.

1602
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,940
DANIEL: Our Neighborhood Watch
is about to start.

1603
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,525
Can I get everybody's attention?

1604
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,744
Would you like one? Those are so cute.

1605
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,537
They're like little edible penises.

1606
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,540
I wish they had them in the strip club.
They're great niblets.

1607
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,079
This is delicious.

1608
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,538
And so easy,
from freezer to microwave to mouth.

1609
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,963
(CHUCKLES)

1610
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:54,338
Stan.

1611
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,469
DANIEL: Okay. Eyes front, neighbors.

1612
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:57,670
Now, we'd all like to believe

1613
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,222
we're safe here in
Old Cutler Cove Estates.

1614
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,516
I know I feel more snug
and secure than I've ever.

1615
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:02,717
And I feel very welcomed,

1616
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,677
and I want to
thank you all for that. Okay?

1617
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,729
But this is a very serious situation.

1618
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,723
Okay? There are bad guys out there

1619
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,059
that are waiting for
good people like us to drop our guard.

1620
01:11:11,142 --> 01:11:12,689
Bad guys are everywhere.

1621
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,775
I should know, okay.
I work for the government.

1622
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,197
And I've been to prison.

1623
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,316
And it sucks!

1624
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,818
At this first meeting
of the Neighborhood Watch,

1625
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,324
Peter, Dick and I will demonstrate

1626
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,780
a few ways we can keep ourselves safe.

1627
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,790
- My pal, Dick... (SNAPPING FINGERS)
- Yeah.

1628
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:27,913
...who works with me at the government,

1629
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,118
will now hand out
your preparedness packs.

1630
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,169
Right.

1631
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,292
That means we have to hand
out the preparedness packs,

1632
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,793
-thank you.
- PAUL: Yeah. Right away.

1633
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,170
In our own corner
of the American dream,

1634
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,547
safety requires vigilance.

1635
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,428
Okay, look at our chart here.

1636
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,598
Number one thing,
vigilance equals safety.

1637
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,299
-(SNIFFING)
- Number two, recognizing...

1638
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:47,057
PAUL: Oh, baby. That's the one. Yeah.

1639
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:51,725
Okay. First thing,
recognizing a potential attacker.

1640
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,523
Sorry about that. There it is.

1641
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:56,604
Peter?

1642
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:57,946
- ADRIAN: Safety pack.
-(SNIFFLING)

1643
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,819
Each family gets a pack.

1644
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,493
Each pack has
pepper spray and a taser.

1645
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,990
Ladies, these things work.

1646
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,664
You can zap a guy's balls off
with one hit, all right.

1647
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,662
Okay! The lovely Sorina here...

1648
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:10,539
- Ta-da!
-...Is going to be the victim.

1649
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:12,620
Who wants to volunteer to be a rapist?

1650
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:13,834
MAN 1: Oh, sure.

1651
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:14,914
MAN 2: Right here!

1652
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,333
Me. Pick me.

1653
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,008
Can you pick me? Can you pick me?

1654
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,758
We're only picking one, guys.
This is not a gang rape, okay.

1655
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,089
You sit down. We'll take Brad.

1656
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:23,347
Yes!

1657
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,841
DANIEL: My favorite neighbor.

1658
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,767
BRAD: He picked me, he picked me.

1659
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,143
Hi, I'm Brad.

1660
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:29,391
You touch her, I'll fuck you up!

1661
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,763
- Hey!
- It was nice meeting you.

1662
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:31,894
Dick.

1663
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:34,067
This is only a simulation, okay?
Cairn it down.

1664
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,859
PAUL: Well, that's what
I'd do in this situation.

1665
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,608
I'll fuck him up!

1666
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,355
Paul, now.

1667
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,532
Honey, I had to grab her <i>ass.</i>
Look, I was the rapist!

1668
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,029
- You're a perv.
- It was role playing.

1669
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,202
DANIEL: What the hell are you doing?

1670
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,370
What?

1671
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,743
"What?" You look like shit.

1672
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:50,291
I feel like I look great.

1673
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,164
This is a critical time, Paul. Okay?

1674
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:53,711
We cannot afford to mess this up.

1675
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,881
I agree. You don't need
all this Kumbaya shit.

1676
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,378
Excuse me? I blended in, okay?

1677
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,585
I'm an influential member
of this community now.

1678
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,796
Have some respect and act accordingly.

1679
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,924
SORINA: Paul?

1680
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,851
The hotel wants you
to pay your $47,000 bill

1681
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,894
or they're kicking us out.

(PAUL GROANING)

1683
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,315
Yeah, honey?

1684
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,565
What are you doing?

1685

(GRUNTS)

1686
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,227
I'm praying.

1687
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,358
Well,

1688
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:22,156
(VOICE ECHOING)
you should pray for $500

1689
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,483
to relocate a pair of Jimmy Choos

1690
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:25,409
from Neiman's to my shoe closet.

1691
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,577
Okay.

1692
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,622
Secret Agent Sorina
needs pimpy shoes for proper spying.

1693
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:32,583
Secret agent,
Jimmy Choo shoes, I got it.

1694
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,785
Mmm. (KISSES)

(GROANING)

1696
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,799
Jimmy Choo shoes. Cash.

1697

<i>PAUL:
Sometimes, when you hit rock bottom,</i>

1698
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,970
<i>you happen to be on the 20th floor.</i>

1699
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,425
<i>I had a choice. Take the fast way down,</i>

1700
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,430
<i>or find a way to keep climbing.</i>

1701
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,688
Lord God, this place is depressing.

1703
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,523
And so is this.

(VICTOR GRUNTS)

1705
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,651
No matter how it gets there,
your John Hancock shows

01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:05,483
notarized, even at a 90-degree angle.

1707
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,568
It's all legal and binding.

1708
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,451
Oh, funny thing,
when a man's blindfolded,

1709
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,078
electro-shocked, beaten with sex toys,

1710
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,750
and hung like dry cleaning,

1711
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,623
he tends to sign just about anything.

1712

The Sun Gym Gang
has successfully acquired

every asset you had.

And they're enjoying it.

1715
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,586
So I don't have a move?

1716

2735
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:30,974
<i>Maybe I did, though.</i>

2736
02:00:31,182 --> 02:00:34,311
<i>Maybe it got so I didn't want to
be "equal to" anymore.</i>

2737
02:00:34,394 --> 02:00:36,692
<i>I wanted to be "better than.“</i>

2738
02:00:36,813 --> 02:00:38,907
<i>And that's a recipe for injury.</i>

2739
02:00:38,982 --> 02:00:41,076
<i>That doesn't mean you give up, though.</i>

2740
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:44,371
<i>You rest, you heal and
you get back on that bench.</i>

2741
02:00:44,863 --> 02:00:46,740
<i>Life is going to give me another set.</i>

2742
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:48,120
<i>And I am going to rock it.</i>

2743
02:00:48,199 --> 02:00:49,826
<i>Because my name is Daniel Lugo,</i>

2744
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,911
<i>and I believe in fitness.</i>

2746
02:01:40,794 --> 02:01:42,137
DANIEL: (VOICE ECHOING)
That's the American dream.
