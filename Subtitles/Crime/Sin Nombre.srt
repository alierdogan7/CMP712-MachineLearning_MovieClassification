00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:37,128
Miss.

2
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:40,316
What do you want?

3
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,713
I told you not to come here to bother Benito.

4
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,336
Benito!!

5
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:48,704
You are a criminal and my
baby won't be a criminal like you.

6
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,328
Benito is not coming out!!!

7
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:56,148
Or I'll call the police to take you to jail,
that's what you want, you asshole.

8
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:57,113
Grandma.

9
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:00,416
You shut up and go back inside!

10
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:05,417
You aren't going out I told you,
don't you understand spanish

11
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:24,227
Let this be our secret my friend...

12
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:26,528
...keep the secret here, ok?

13
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,355
Lil' Mago ( Magician ) wants to see you.

14
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:50,356
One...

15
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:57,457
Two...

16
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:02,058
Three...

17
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:04,759
Four...

18
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,960
Five...

19
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,961
Six...

20
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:16,662
Seven...

21
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:19,463
Eight...

22
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:21,364
Nine...

23
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,165
Ten...

24
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:26,766
Eleven...

25
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:28,967
Twelve...

26
00:04:32,768 --> 00:04:34,268
Twelve...

27
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:38,569
Twelve... Twelve...

28
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,170
...Thirteen.

29
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:07,478
Congratulations little Homie!

30
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,769
Casper, look at the kids smile.

31
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,433
The gang who controls "Salvatrucha" gang.

32
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:37,749
Your dad is waiting for you.

33
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:42,717
Look, I know why you
want to do this trip, but...

34
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,218
...I don't know why I have to do it.

35
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,866
If you don't want to go,
grandma can not make you go, but...

36
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,867
...my brother won't come back for you again.

37
00:05:55,372 --> 00:06:01,950
Look, I don't need anyone, I can go
to the north by myself if I wanted to.

38
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:10,872
Come with us, it won't be easy over
there, but at least we will be together.

39
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,786
There is nothing for you here, Sayra.

40
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:17,987
Nothing.

41
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,543
She is here.

42
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:46,407
Damn, if I didn't know I wouldn't recognize her.

43
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:56,504
She is a lady now.

44
00:06:57,787 --> 00:07:00,535
Now you can recover your lost time.

45
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:03,968
We will do that on the way mother.

46
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:09,592
Tomorrow before sunrise we will grab the bus.

47
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,551
Don't worry, she will be ready.

48
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:21,806
"The Bombilla" Tapachula, Southern Mexico.

49
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:25,971
Here is Lucrecia with her products.

50
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,099
Casper, how have you been, now you
are a pederast?, the smaller the more idiots.

51
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,503
Look how you beat him up, you are a barbarian.

52
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,719
Tortillas, coffee, baleadas,soups!!!

53
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:54,083
Thank you!

54
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,007
Slow baby, slow..

55
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:46,788
Stop it.

56
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,852
Martha Marlene.

57
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:08,972
I am bored.

58
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:09,976
why?

59
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:13,375
Can you take me somewhere?

60
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:15,975
Where do you want to go?

61
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:24,948
I don't know, wherever you want to,
where you go when you are not here.

62
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,532
You have another girl in your neighborhood, right?

63
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:31,776
Of course not.

64
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:36,056
You better not, because if I
realize that you have other girl......

65
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,140
What?

66
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:45,724
It shrinked...

67
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:49,699
Oh, it's normal, look...

68
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,200
...now it will be refreshed.

69
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,848
Do you think she will have a friend for me?

70
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:04,556
Be careful my friend "Smiley"...

71
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:08,312
...don't say anything that
we left from the "Bombilla"

72
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:11,287
Don't say anything at all,
so Lil' Mago won't notice.

73
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,011
Ok?

74
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:13,591
Yes.

75
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:15,392
Not a fucking word!

76
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:26,376
Little Homie, you will first earn your letters,
hitting on a "Kiddo" (rival gangster)...

77
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:31,871
...then after that, you will conquer a girl.

78
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:38,695
Welcome to the destroyer.

79
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,700
- What's up, homie?
- Cool, brother.

80
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:53,650
What's up Casper you dog!

81
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,843
What, did he kill a "kiddo" yet, uh?

82
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:05,402
This is the "Naughty" and the "Smoky"...

83
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:10,011
...they just arrived, they come and
go to see what's going on here.

84
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:13,042
They are "Guanacos".
Are you thirsty?

85
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:36,139
This guy is "gold" we call him "the buttocks"...

86
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,970
...and this is the "Querubin".

87
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:47,994
He can't sit , his ass is bleeding...

88
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:51,906
...he has hemorroids.

89
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:14,083
This you have to earn it...
for the moment you have to share.

90
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:16,638
What's for the gang is for the gang.

91
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:29,026
He is the one that has the second voice.

92
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,251
Hey, my dogs are here.

93
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:38,931
How was it?

94
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:41,651
Did you go to the "Bombilla"?

95
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:46,387
Yes, but we didn't find anything.

96
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:56,683
The "Sol" found him with
another group of "chickens"...

97
00:13:57,484 --> 00:13:58,784
...in the "Bombilla".

98
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:02,436
Take him out.

99
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:09,043
Don't worry, nothing is happening,
now that dog that scares you will die.

100
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,843
You fucked up "Kiddo",
you got in the train of the gang.

101
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:28,843
I'm only going to the north, please, please!!

102
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,792
You are already worthless you fucker...

103
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:38,905
...we will cut you in 18 pieces
and we will feed the dogs.

104
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:44,225
I have a family...
and I'm not a gangster anymore.

105
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:54,254
"kiddo" will always be a "kiddo"

106
00:14:57,048 --> 00:15:00,892
Casper, give "Smiley" a hand.

107
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,216
Both of you, get him.

108
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:18,360
Point to his head.

109
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:21,097
This is for the fallen Homies, you fucker.

110
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:22,798
To the count of three...

111
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:24,525
One...

112
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:26,026
Two...

113
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:27,627
...Three.

114
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:57,332
The first time is like this
little Homie, don't chicken out.

115
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:04,972
The scareness goes away,
but the gang is forever.

116
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:13,176
Now you belong to a family
with thousands of brothers...

117
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:19,320
...wherever you go, there will
always be someone that protects you

118
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,556
Food is here!!

119
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:48,617
You were not in the "Bombilla" today.

120
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:52,140
The "Sol" didn't see you.

121
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:58,036
I was there the whole day,
and I didn't see him neither.

122
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,776
You are not playing gay, right Homie?

123
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:11,368
It has been many times already,
now the "Sol" didn't see you.

124
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,117
Forget what I said Homie...

125
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,253
...the homies are getting altered.

126
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:27,154
I love you dog, from my heart.

127
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:34,756
3 days later.

128
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:44,532
908 555 0187... again.

129
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:50,079
we learned it already.

130
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,465
repeat it.

131
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:52,932
I told you we learned it already.

132
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:58,596
you have to learn that number, if something
goes wrong, Yessenia can help you out.

133
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:02,504
Horacio, how much time left man?

134
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:05,104
Around 6 hours.

135
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,212
Are you tired?

136
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:08,685
Yes.

137
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:16,080
You have to see it as an adventure brother,
we are going to an adventure.

138
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:21,361
repeat the number one more time.

139
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:44,288
Guatemala-México Border.

140
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:06,980
Welcome to México.

141
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:09,948
Your documents.

142
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:12,797
You don't have, right?
everyone come this way.

143
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:26,076
First you are going to empty your pockets
and take out everything that has some value...

144
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:32,421
...after that, take off your clothes and put it
in front of you... start with the shoes.

145
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,578
We walked too much!

146
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,185
We need to buy some water for her...

147
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:32,908
With what money?

148
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:43,380
Bring two big bottles.

149
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:03,281
Your second toe is bigger than the others...

150
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:06,185
...that means you run fast.

151
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:22,216
This is what we have walked today.

152
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:26,949
If there is no immigration
we will be here in two weeks.

153
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:30,157
- Two weeks?
- Maybe three.

154
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,740
Where is New Jersey?

155
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:39,564
It's not in the map.

156
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:46,848
Look, not even half of them will arrive to the U.S.

157
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:54,196
...but we are going to get there.

158
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,284
Yessenia is not as pretty as your Mom was...

159
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,828
...but she has a big heart.

160
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:12,133
The girls are beautiful.

161
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,756
Keep it, now they are your family also.

162
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:24,292
I don't want a picture of your family.

163
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,857
You are taking me in this trip,
and I thank you for that.

164
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:44,061
I will go call home.

165
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:03,572
Look at him,
I remember him more handsome.

166
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,080
No, the handsome one in the family is me.

167
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:16,332
Don't tell me you are not a little happy.

168
00:23:16,465 --> 00:23:18,564
If he was not deported, he wouldn't be here.

169
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:21,697
- Don't think in that bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

170
00:24:09,024 --> 00:24:10,728
Do you see that train?

171
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:19,120
That's our train, what do you say if
we grab it and go all the way to Texas?

172
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:23,152
I can take you to six flags.

173
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,768
Tell me one more time that you love me.

174
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,640
I love you.

175
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:44,053
Tell me that you won't hide me anymore.

176
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:46,837
It's not that.

177
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:49,213
Of course, you hide from me.

178
00:24:51,863 --> 00:24:55,544
You already know all that is worth it.

179
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,124
Martha Marlene.

180
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:01,925
Martha Marlene.

181
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:12,017
You think I don't realize what you
do the whole day with your friends?

182
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,944
You get high with other girls,
and fool around the whole day.

183
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,800
Homies you two go to the trains.

184
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:26,760
Casper, Smiley.

185
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,368
What's up "Sol"?

186
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:34,224
What's up?

187
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:36,825
Who is this girl?

188
00:25:36,932 --> 00:25:40,398
Martha Marlene, he is  the "Sol".

189
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:46,128
Is she your girl?

190
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,108
No, she is just a friend.

191
00:25:55,065 --> 00:25:59,704
We have meeting tomorrow
at the cemetery, in the afternoon.

192
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:02,544
Be careful, ok?

193
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:15,480
Hey, be aware Homie,
the entrance is full of "kiddos"...

194
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:18,481
... who knows who is sneaking in with the people.

195
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,637
I'll take you home.

196
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,048
Friend..... you idiot.

197
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:35,087
Homie, wait here Smiley.

198
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:36,388
Wait for me.

199
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:05,697
Let's go.

200
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:22,430
There will be no train.

201
00:28:22,864 --> 00:28:25,372
The train went off the rail ahead,
there were many dead people.

202
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,725
Where did you hear that?

203
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:29,685
Some "Salvadorians" told me.

204
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,161
There will be no train!!!

205
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:17,017
We need more money to buy the
defense for the homies that are in jail.

206
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:21,037
finally, some Homies have
screwed up in their obligations...

207
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,676
...and the "kiddos" are getting in the territory.

208
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:29,013
We cannot allow those dogs bringing
their garbage in the neighborhood...

209
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,081
There will be "cut" for Casper and Smiley.

210
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:35,344
They fooled me...

211
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:40,621
...and you know that you cant lie to the leader....
worst, lie to the neighborhood.

212
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:44,392
Now I want to hear your version.

213
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:48,345
Where did you go after the "Bombilla"?

214
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:55,028
Smiley, where did you go?

215
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:00,828
Ok, your gun.

216
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,725
that's all.

217
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:18,456
"Salvatrucha" gang, the gang who
controls the "Salvatrucha" gang.

218
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,909
What are you doing here?

219
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:37,732
You have to go!

220
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,033
Now!

221
00:30:39,945 --> 00:30:42,701
Why? is it a private party?

222
00:30:43,657 --> 00:30:47,027
What's up Casper? who is this girl?

223
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:48,564
A friend.

224
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:49,872
From where?

225
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,844
I am from downtown.

226
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,688
Oh, sorry, I confused you.

227
00:30:56,796 --> 00:30:58,108
I was going to take her to the exit.

228
00:30:58,653 --> 00:30:59,305
No.

229
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:05,812
It won't take time Homie.

230
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:07,957
If you want I can take her...

231
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,658
...or she can stay and watch.

232
00:31:11,896 --> 00:31:14,144
But you don't go anywhere Homie.

233
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:21,745
Take her directly to her house Homie.

234
00:31:43,784 --> 00:31:46,216
13 seconds of cut for being a liar.

235
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:47,817
One...

236
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:51,377
Two...Three...

237
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:56,476
Smiley, you also have 13 seconds
for not saying anything against Casper.

238
00:32:02,697 --> 00:32:09,124
This is the largest tree in Tapachula, if you
go to the top, you can see very far away.

239
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,985
Why Willie couldn't come?

240
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:15,786
Willie?

241
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:20,591
Do you refer to Casper?

242
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:29,277
Ohh, I get it now.

243
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:41,585
You are the reason for him being abscent.

244
00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:47,456
Sit down, I want to talk to you.

245
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,685
Closer.

246
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:01,186
Closer.

247
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:08,787
Don't be shy, I won't bite you.

248
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,133
So...

249
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:19,234
...you and Casper are more than friends.

250
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,205
I have to go.

251
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:39,021
Has he told you anything about us?

252
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:51,816
Do you know what are the most
important rules to keep a friendship?

253
00:33:54,852 --> 00:34:01,932
Honesty, respect, and generosity.

254
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:41,677
hey girl...

255
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:11,065
Where is Martha Marlene?

256
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:13,860
She left.

257
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:16,069
To her house?

258
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:20,512
The beast took her.

259
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:32,153
You will find another one.

260
00:35:55,308 --> 00:35:57,981
We are going to make a trip to Tonala...

261
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:00,744
...you and smiley will go with me.

262
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:10,057
Homie, one more thing...

263
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:16,458
...you lie to me again...

264
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:20,359
... and I will kill you myself.

265
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:33,380
Horacio, they already cleared the railway...

266
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:35,221
...the train goes this night thank god.

267
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:01,313
Give me the money!

268
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:09,303
Fast, fast!

269
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,555
give me the money!

270
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:47,396
Give him the money fast, fast.

271
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,365
That's enough!

272
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,544
Turn around!

273
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,392
Dad, Dad!!!

274
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,188
Smiley, get off the train!

275
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:07,200
but.. Casper.

276
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:09,739
Get off man!!!

277
00:42:13,817 --> 00:42:15,224
Go Smiley, Go!!!

278
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:05,304
He is dangerous.

279
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:08,023
Are you ok?

280
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:10,279
He is not doing anything to us.

281
00:43:11,752 --> 00:43:13,483
He is a gangster man.

282
00:43:15,615 --> 00:43:17,432
We have to knock him off the train.

283
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:21,508
Immigration!!!! immigration!!!!

284
00:44:41,129 --> 00:44:43,646
Raise your spawn "Salvatrucha" gang.

285
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:02,794
Homies...

286
00:45:05,295 --> 00:45:07,995
...we have to talk about Casper.

287
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:11,073
We should all go and get him at once.

288
00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:15,561
No Homie, water is not ready for beans yet.

289
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,941
Much less with so many fucker around.

290
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:21,469
They can attack the neighborhood...

291
00:45:21,734 --> 00:45:27,862
...we have to run the voice, even we don't catch
him now, sooner or later the sun will light him

292
00:45:28,386 --> 00:45:30,234
when that happens...

293
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:37,366
I am not a sissy, that's why I returned.

294
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:44,734
Then you are lucky I don't kill you smiley.

295
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:50,050
You seem not to have feelings
for the neighborhood, right?

296
00:45:52,302 --> 00:45:56,310
If you didn't have the balls to kill Casper,
how do I know you didn't help him escape?

297
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:00,018
That's what happened right, you fucker?

298
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:02,120
I didn't do anything!!

299
00:46:05,938 --> 00:46:08,775
I will dissapear you from
the neighborhood, you fucker!

300
00:46:14,887 --> 00:46:18,601
Show me you are not a sissy, show me!!!

301
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:37,854
Send me, send me so I can show you
that I have feelings for the neighborhood.

302
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:45,546
Send me so I can look for him, and kill him.

303
00:46:55,121 --> 00:47:01,277
Calm down "Sol", hold it, hold it man.

304
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:09,605
Get going now.

305
00:47:10,806 --> 00:47:14,106
Go and kill  him if you want to stand out.

306
00:47:15,162 --> 00:47:20,469
if you don't kill him, then don't even
dare to come back to the neighborhood.

307
00:47:27,025 --> 00:47:29,237
Son of a bitch, he doesn't
even know where his dick is!!

308
00:47:31,914 --> 00:47:34,786
We have to communicate it
to all the gangsters in L.A.

309
00:47:36,898 --> 00:47:40,394
That dog cannot have even a shadow to hide!!

310
00:48:08,506 --> 00:48:10,026
You going to die.

311
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:05,074
Thank you.

312
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:08,178
My name is Sayra.

313
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,919
I am Willie.

314
00:49:31,065 --> 00:49:33,253
He killed Lil' Mago...

315
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:38,042
...he got warned, there is green light
to kill him, those are the rules.

316
00:49:38,986 --> 00:49:41,909
And how are you going to kill him?

317
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:50,405
Wow!, thats so pretty! how many you got?

318
00:49:51,013 --> 00:49:54,189
Enough to kill you all.

319
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:07,121
Kill him but hiding.

320
00:50:58,509 --> 00:51:02,490
Sleep, I will stay awake.

321
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:11,579
You see, my family is very poor, we barely
had a little bit of beans to eat once in a while.

322
00:53:57,728 --> 00:53:59,739
You are not going to wash yourself?

323
00:54:07,819 --> 00:54:09,821
It feels good.

324
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,564
I don't know, maybe later.

325
00:54:18,408 --> 00:54:21,216
When there is less people.

326
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:27,248
And what will you do later?

327
00:54:28,544 --> 00:54:29,871
I don't know.

328
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:40,939
Will you stay here tonight?

329
00:54:51,628 --> 00:54:54,904
If i find food around I will bring you later.

330
00:55:01,633 --> 00:55:03,480
What were you talking with him?

331
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:05,248
We can help him.

332
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,929
Are you crazy?
we have to stay away from him.

333
00:55:10,283 --> 00:55:11,760
No, you don't understand.

334
00:55:13,751 --> 00:55:15,575
He is a killer.

335
00:55:16,015 --> 00:55:17,951
- He is in trouble.
- I am ordering you.

336
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:20,176
But he is in trouble!

337
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,068
I don't care about him, I care
about you and my brother Orlando.

338
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:31,128
Look, we still have a long way to get there.

339
00:55:34,408 --> 00:55:40,308
We have to be aware, we
can't let anyone separate us, ok?

340
00:56:01,884 --> 00:56:03,575
Who is the boss?

341
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:04,644
I am.

342
00:56:07,979 --> 00:56:09,675
I am Smiley from the Confetti neighborhood.

343
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:16,708
Who is the boss now in the Confetti?

344
00:56:17,036 --> 00:56:18,776
The "Sol".

345
00:56:21,184 --> 00:56:23,364
we knew what happened...

346
00:56:25,165 --> 00:56:27,465
...are you hungry or thirsty?

347
00:56:30,812 --> 00:56:32,968
Have you ever got into one of those?

348
00:56:35,744 --> 00:56:37,180
...me neither.

349
00:56:39,181 --> 00:56:45,323
In a road heading to Texas, I saw
a factory where they build them.

350
00:56:46,996 --> 00:56:50,388
There was a letter board,
very big, with the world shape...

351
00:56:50,689 --> 00:56:53,389
...and it was shiny, so beautiful.

352
00:56:56,075 --> 00:56:58,776
I wanted to get on it.

353
00:57:00,148 --> 00:57:06,300
when I go through there, I will
see it and it will remind me of you.

354
00:57:06,816 --> 00:57:08,405
If you make it all the way.

355
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:13,260
I will make it... I am sure.

356
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:19,823
In Tegus I went with my friend Clarissa,
to my neighbor's house...

357
00:57:20,056 --> 00:57:22,676
...a crazy old lady called Leonor...

358
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,424
...she was a witch.

359
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:31,905
She told me with scared voice,
you will make it to the U.S.

360
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:37,068
...but not holding god's hand,
but holding the devil's spawn.

361
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,419
if you come with us, you can show me
the letter board you are talking about...

362
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:50,592
...we are heading to New Jersey.

363
00:57:53,908 --> 00:57:56,360
They are coming for you right?

364
00:57:57,365 --> 00:58:00,887
I think so, sooner or later they will find me...

365
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,888
...the gang has good memory.

366
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:07,820
Are you afraid?

367
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:10,921
To be killed?

368
00:58:11,857 --> 00:58:16,468
No, I live by the day.

369
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,844
What worries me is not knowing
what time and which day they will kill me.

370
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:28,680
- So you have not seen him?
- No.

371
00:58:31,872 --> 00:58:33,404
He has a teardrop tatooed here.

372
00:58:33,588 --> 00:58:38,060
No, I haven't seen anyone tatooed,
since 5 days ago until now you guys.

373
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:48,680
Hey, sons of a bitch!!

374
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:52,971
I know about that guy you are looking for...

375
00:58:55,272 --> 00:58:58,272
...he has a tear drop tatooed here.

376
01:00:04,052 --> 01:00:05,876
Thank you!!

377
01:00:14,312 --> 01:00:16,079
We have to get down...

378
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,580
What?

379
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,581
We have to get down.

380
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:22,552
why?

381
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:26,408
In this station, immigration is
always fucking up...

382
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,240
...and sometimes the police also.

383
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:31,947
So what do we do?

384
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:37,148
We get down and surround the train fast,
we must be alert!

385
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:02,432
Good day for running, uh?

386
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,516
Me and Smiley will go the other way...

387
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:09,872
...we see each other in the other side of the station.

388
01:01:57,911 --> 01:02:00,472
Hey, what's up, ese?

389
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:02,973
The "M", what's your neighborhood, fucker?

390
01:02:04,874 --> 01:02:06,874
Hey, look at the guy, he is from the other gang.

391
01:02:12,631 --> 01:02:15,252
Take out your fucking gun Smiley!

392
01:02:18,184 --> 01:02:22,436
Don't worry Homie, these
guys always miss the target...

393
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,516
...except this one.

394
01:03:26,624 --> 01:03:29,139
Where the fuck were you Homies?

395
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,046
...didn't you hear the gunshots?

396
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:37,588
Yes Homie, but we almost catch Casper.

397
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:44,903
You left us behind with those
assholes, and.. where is Casper?

398
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,815
In the train.

399
01:03:49,287 --> 01:03:51,970
I want to take that fucker down.

400
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,772
Get on, Smiley, you go in the front.

401
01:06:51,214 --> 01:06:53,167
You are leaving just like that?

402
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,047
So what do you want?

403
01:06:55,243 --> 01:06:57,147
Go with you.

404
01:07:12,448 --> 01:07:14,548
Oh, God! She fucked up!!

405
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:23,455
I can't take care of you.

406
01:07:27,095 --> 01:07:29,743
I am not asking you for it.

407
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:34,047
For god sake Sayra,
realize  that I am a dead man!

408
01:07:34,848 --> 01:07:36,648
...don't you get it?

409
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:40,003
Don't worry Willie.

410
01:07:40,904 --> 01:07:42,604
Everything will be ok.

411
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:57,551
You messed up, you don't have
any idea about the mess you are in.

412
01:08:12,939 --> 01:08:16,187
Horacio, Sayra is not here.

413
01:08:26,867 --> 01:08:30,435
Oh Casper, why the fuck you came here?

414
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:34,099
You are just putting me into trouble.

415
01:08:36,814 --> 01:08:40,539
I can do what you are asking for,
but really, it's trouble.

416
01:08:41,646 --> 01:08:43,990
I have to do some things first.

417
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:46,491
you guys hungry?

418
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,423
You can stay sleeping in the sofa.

419
01:08:51,424 --> 01:08:53,224
Do you guys want to take a shower?

420
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:59,091
You are a little one.

421
01:09:00,871 --> 01:09:03,731
Well, let me see what I've got.

422
01:09:07,574 --> 01:09:09,735
I thought you didn't have family.

423
01:09:09,864 --> 01:09:12,755
I don't, she is not my aunt...

424
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:16,111
...I used to take people on her territory.

425
01:09:16,536 --> 01:09:18,432
And she will take us to the border?

426
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:23,178
Are you coming with me?

427
01:09:23,271 --> 01:09:25,675
Let's see, try this on..

428
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:28,476
I hope it fits you.

429
01:09:28,879 --> 01:09:30,415
The shower is over there...

430
01:09:30,716 --> 01:09:32,716
...but don't get close to the window, ok?

431
01:09:33,071 --> 01:09:35,019
I don't want anyone to know you are here.

432
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:56,114
What are you going to do with the girl?

433
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:02,247
I'll help her get to the border
so she can find her family over there.

434
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:06,895
And what do you get with all this?

435
01:10:07,023 --> 01:10:08,407
Nothing.

436
01:10:11,131 --> 01:10:12,988
Ok, Casper.

437
01:10:15,289 --> 01:10:17,389
Going straight to the border...

438
01:10:18,887 --> 01:10:21,143
...you know what awaits for you.

439
01:10:22,644 --> 01:10:24,844
Did you know they already called me?

440
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,466
And what did you tell them?

441
01:10:27,635 --> 01:10:32,243
Nothing, the truth, that I haven't seen you...
but they called me yesterday.

442
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:41,412
You are not going to tell them, right?

443
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:43,759
I always do the right thing.

444
01:10:44,739 --> 01:10:47,539
Maybe she went down to
take a pee and the train left her.

445
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:54,599
She left.

446
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,800
So, we wait here.

447
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,991
We can't wait.

448
01:11:07,692 --> 01:11:10,492
We have to go
or we won't get there either.

449
01:11:37,644 --> 01:11:39,880
Ok, fuck!

450
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:54,732
Take this.

451
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:55,848
Thank you, aunt.

452
01:11:56,101 --> 01:11:57,300
Don't thank me.

453
01:12:25,369 --> 01:12:29,848
"Sol", it's a pleasure to hear you.

454
01:12:54,192 --> 01:12:55,505
Are you afraid?

455
01:12:56,532 --> 01:13:01,165
No, if I am with you I am ok.

456
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:10,736
The opposite, while you
are with me you are not ok.

457
01:13:11,676 --> 01:13:14,824
I don't care, I trust you.

458
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,981
This scar here...

459
01:13:24,382 --> 01:13:27,082
...my gang sent me to leave
a "chicken" to the border...

460
01:13:28,892 --> 01:13:36,047
...and in Tamaulipas, a cop started to shoot me...

461
01:13:37,901 --> 01:13:44,821
...and here, one from the 18,
there was a fight in their territory.

462
01:13:45,904 --> 01:13:52,169
This scar here is from the night that the
Homies that I have defended all my life...

463
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:57,540
...killed my love.

464
01:14:01,148 --> 01:14:05,032
And I couldn't do anything for her.

465
01:14:09,357 --> 01:14:12,544
Do you still trust me, Sayra?

466
01:14:14,896 --> 01:14:17,303
We both know what a loss is.

467
01:14:18,592 --> 01:14:23,832
All that I know, is that my
whole life has been worthless.

468
01:14:24,772 --> 01:14:27,720
And that I can ruin your life too.

469
01:14:43,176 --> 01:14:51,680
Get off, go away!!

470
01:15:11,221 --> 01:15:12,281
I love you!

471
01:15:12,993 --> 01:15:15,488
Come on, say it with more feeling.

472
01:15:16,212 --> 01:15:19,361
It's just that I love you so much
that I don't even know what to tell you.

473
01:15:19,609 --> 01:15:21,592
I don't know how to express it.

474
01:15:26,668 --> 01:15:30,216
if you can measure it with
your hands, how much would it be?

475
01:15:30,861 --> 01:15:34,992
It wouldn't be possible, I would need many miles...

476
01:15:35,793 --> 01:15:39,293
...or the whole universe to
tell you how much I love you.

477
01:17:38,024 --> 01:17:39,832
Get off, you assholes!!

478
01:17:43,032 --> 01:17:46,864
Hide, hide, hide there.

479
01:19:17,437 --> 01:19:22,245
Ok, this card is your pass,
it's only valid for 3 nights...

480
01:19:22,785 --> 01:19:26,965
...then you have to leave to give
space to the people that just arrived.

481
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:33,521
You have two meals everyday, lunch and
dinner and please respect the rules in the wall.

482
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:14,746
We don't want low life people like
you here, you fucking gangster.

483
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:16,624
Not now.

484
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,737
That's the least, you can't be here!

485
01:20:27,277 --> 01:20:29,713
Let him go kid, let him!

486
01:20:39,529 --> 01:20:44,432
Hey, I can't believe that you are here.

487
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,961
Have you seen my dad and my uncle?

488
01:20:54,296 --> 01:20:55,652
What?

489
01:20:55,781 --> 01:20:57,893
Your uncle was deported, and......

490
01:21:03,577 --> 01:21:06,581
...your father is not with us anymore.

491
01:23:10,575 --> 01:23:13,892
When we are in the other side,
I want you to promise something.

492
01:23:14,476 --> 01:23:15,519
What?

493
01:23:15,723 --> 01:23:19,354
That no matter what, you
will look for your family in New Jersey.

494
01:23:26,151 --> 01:23:29,267
Now you have to little sisters
that have no father anymore.

495
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:34,196
I would be trouble for them,
as I am for everyone.

496
01:23:34,767 --> 01:23:36,147
Not for me.

497
01:23:40,247 --> 01:23:44,723
But you have to help them
in something, working.

498
01:23:50,124 --> 01:23:51,840
Are you coming with me?

499
01:23:53,307 --> 01:23:54,236
Yes.

500
01:24:14,114 --> 01:24:15,595
I am looking for a boat.

501
01:24:16,099 --> 01:24:17,818
Do you want to cross?

502
01:24:34,966 --> 01:24:36,023
come on!

503
01:24:44,039 --> 01:24:45,475
I can only pass one at the time.

504
01:24:45,838 --> 01:24:46,911
The money?

505
01:24:47,952 --> 01:24:49,702
When we cross we give it to you.

506
01:25:16,876 --> 01:25:18,035
Go on fast.

507
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:34,987
Turn around.

508
01:26:00,191 --> 01:26:02,586
Hurry up and get in the water.

509
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:33,088
No... we have to go back!!!!

510
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:49,939
Let me go!

511
01:27:07,384 --> 01:27:08,674
Smiley....

512
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:14,775
The gang is forever, Homie.

513
01:29:27,538 --> 01:29:30,218
~ My lips became sealed at this moment...~

514
01:29:30,644 --> 01:29:36,330
~ ...when I tried to say goodbye. ~

515
01:29:36,584 --> 01:29:39,087
~ and how would my soul be if... ~

516
01:29:39,731 --> 01:29:43,179
~ ...I will live far away from you. ~

517
01:29:45,812 --> 01:29:49,355
~ Come to my side, ~

518
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:53,667
~ ...come life of my own being. ~

519
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:57,195
~ I want to see me in your eyes... ~

520
01:29:57,734 --> 01:30:02,635
~ ...and get drunk in the breath
that your mouth exhales... ~

521
01:30:02,896 --> 01:30:04,728
~ ...with the sweetness... ~

522
01:30:05,027 --> 01:30:09,555
~...natural from your loving soul. ~

523
01:30:09,735 --> 01:30:16,157
~ That destiny forces me
with pain to let you go.~

524
01:30:47,083 --> 01:30:52,682
~ Abscent from you I will live woman... ~

525
01:30:52,779 --> 01:30:59,276
~ ...but you live in my sad heart. ~

526
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:02,711
~ Yours is my heart. ~

527
01:31:03,444 --> 01:31:07,611
~ You are the angel that came from the sky... ~

528
01:31:08,307 --> 01:31:14,474
~ ...to this tough life,
to sweeten my bitter youth. ~

529
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:22,580
~ But if there is a disgrace... ~

530
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:26,532
~ ...that you die, or I die... ~

531
