1
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,120
We're federal agents, we are not martyrs!

2
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,620
This is suicide!

3
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,290
She is just one of many abductions.

4
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,830
Why is this abduction so special!

5
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,870
Is it because she's a witness against
the Torrez?

6
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,080
She is probably caught, and drugged.

7
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,250
We do not have to do this!

8
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,000
If not us...

9
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,540
...who?

10
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,660
I told you to stay still!

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,330
Do not try to capture the Torrez!

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,660
Turn around now!

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,250
Machete, you son of a bitch!

14
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,540
Listen to orders!

15
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,410
You'll eventually kill us all!
Wait for reinforcements!

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,790
Whatever happens...

17
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,330
I'm with you...

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,000
...boss.

19
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,450
<i>This</i> is the boss...

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Sorry.

21
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,040
Get dressed.

22
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,250
It's too hot for clothes.

23
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,080
You saving me from Torrez?

24
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,580
You've got balls!

25
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,660
That looks like me.

26
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,950
What's this long hard thing?

27
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,330
My Machete.

28
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,330
Is it sharp?

29
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,040
Very.

30
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,910
Good...

31
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,750
I got him.

32
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,160
Stupid FUCK...

33
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,160
I told you to stay away asshole.

34
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,910
If you had listened to my orders
you would not have been caught.

35
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,200
How did I do?

36
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,040
Excellent my love.

37
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,540
Excellent...

38
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,950
This is what happens when they insist
to be heroes.

39
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,870
Why are you so insistent?

40
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,660
I own the entire force...
And not just here in Mexico.

41
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,620
I own the DEA... I own
the Marshals...

42
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,660
Why can't I own you?

43
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,330
Why don't you take the money
I offered you to look the other way?

44
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,290
What's your price?

45
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,040
Maybe I should ask your
wife.

46
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,620
Bring her in here.

47
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,330
No!

48
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,370
Sara!

49
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,660
Your daughter... she's in
school right now.

50
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,000
No?

51
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,080
I don't think so.

52
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,200
The honorable way to die...
is to cut off your head.

53
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,250
But...

54
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,080
You don't deserve to die honorably.

55
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,660
Burn it!

56
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,700
Joining us right now we have Franklin Jones.

57
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,500
Deputy Director of our local Immigration
and Customs Enforcement [ICE] office.

58
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,620
Thank you and pleasure to be here.

59
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,160
What steps are you taking to
secure our borders?

60
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
ICE is working with local law enforcement
to improve patrols...

61
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,500
but there's over 2000 miles of border
between Mexico and the U.S.

62
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,910
And over half of that is here in Texas, so...

63
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,000
...we need to attack the problem at it's source.

64
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,450
There's a whole support network.

65
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,410
That not only helps illegal aliens get

66
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,540
across but is helping them get settled.
Once they are here.

67
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,620
We need to uncover and dismantle
this network.

68
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,750
It's our top priority and our most talented
ICE agents are investigating them.

69
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,910
Agent Nevada: Day 23 of surveillance for
Operation Network.

70
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,080
The Operation is suspected to be run by
a woman named Loose.

71
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Codename: "She".

72
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,290
Tacos Cafe! TACOS!

73
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,410
Loose operates a taco's truck at the labour site.

74
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,370
There's an interesting...

75
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,250
...face.

76
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,500
No! That's OK.

77
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,250
Thank you.

78
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,000
He's not...

79
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,410
Run through database for
possible criminal background.

80
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,290
Male, Hispanic, scars, tattoo's

81
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,290
Don't fuck with me, I don't
fuck with you attitude.

82
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,330
Hey!

83
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,200
You work today
and pay me tomorrow.

84
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,410
Hi, lady

85
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,330
You need a gardener?

86
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,410
Come on. Stand back.

87
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,660
Hurry!

88
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,250
We have not got.
You can not leave us here!

89
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,080
Move!

90
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,790
She is sick.

91
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,870
Roundup time!

92
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,910
Look at them!

93
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,330
Speak English?

94
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,500
Well, I don't speak much Mexican neither.

95
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,750
You know...

96
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,160
You're trespassing...

97
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,660
...on my daddy's land.

98
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,450
Jesus Van! Can't you see
she's been childed?

99
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,500
If it gets born here.
It gets to be a citizen.

100
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,250
No different than you or me.

101
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,500
I know most people don't like us.

102
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,370
Course... Vigilante's

103
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,580
It's really about vigilance.

104
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,160
Some body's gonna watch out
for this great nation of ours.

105
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,290
Otherwise...

106
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,910
Texas will become...

107
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,330
...Mexico once again.

108
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,500
Who's gonna stop it senator?

109
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,870
I am.

110
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,330
Welcome to America.

111
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,950
You catch all that?

112
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,160
Burn me a DVD. Behind our supporters
are going to like that!

113
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,660
A lot.

114
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,750
The infestation has begun...

115
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,500
parasites have crossed our borders...

116
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,160
have sickening our country...

117
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,790
leeching off out system...

118
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,160
destroying us from the inside.

119
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,160
But Senator John McLauglin

120
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,660
has a plan of attack.

121
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,080
He'll fight to keep illegal immigrants
OUT!

122
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,830
Hey!

123
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,080
Ugly!

124
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,540
Want to fight?

125
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,500
Don't tell me you don't wanna earn
$500 in five minutes.

126
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,750
That's my man!

127
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,000
Bet's! Place your bets!

128
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,700
Fight!

129
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,830
Thanks.

130
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,620
Can I have a beans and cheese.
And a Cafe Olé.

131
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,450
Ain't got no cafe Olé.

132
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,160
Regular coffee then

133
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,160
Oh! hold the spit please.

134
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,830
Why do you pretend to come here
just for coffee?

135
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm not pretending.

136
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,790
I like my coffee cheap and greasy.

137
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,580
I can refuse service to anyone.

138
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,040
Still the American way.

139
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,750
When they are citizens.

140
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,160
Got your papers?

141
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,290
Same as the last time you checked.

142
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,370
And the time before that.

143
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,540
And the time before that!

144
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,950
Got yours?

145
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,200
Same as the last time you checked.

146
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,950
You think what you do is right?

147
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,700
Taking your brothers and sisters in?

148
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,250
Deporting them to their own
personal health?

149
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,660
It's the law.

150
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,950
There are many laws.

151
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,580
There sure are...

152
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,660
Immigration fraud...

153
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,870
Aiding and illegal entry

154
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,160
Insanitary food processing...

155
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
But you wouldn't know anything about that
would you?

156
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,700
Can I get my taco's

157
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,120
Who's she?

158
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,040
I heard she runs an underground network.

159
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,000
How the hell would I know?

160
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,160
I just make tacos and I sell them.

161
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,160
To the workers of this site.

162
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,250
It fills their bellies other
than hate.

163
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,200
Funny.

164
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,200
Sounds like something she would say.

165
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,500
Catch you later.

166
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,330
In the race for State Senator...

167
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,580
Latest polls are showing...

168
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,870
a sharp decline in support for incumbent
Senator John McLaughlin.

169
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,910
And his hard-line position on immigration.

170
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,200
Get in.

171
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,160
Fellow dodged it forever.

172
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,370
125 perceptive.

173
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,450
Sewage.

174
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,250
You ever killed anyone before?

175
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,910
You know this guy?

176
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,330
Senator John McLaughlin...

177
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,580
Independent from cocksucker county.

178
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,830
Built his reputation on being
a hardliner against wetbacks.

179
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,080
Gets worse.

180
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,660
Yes... If he has his brothers.
He'll send you back to old Mehico.

181
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,500
That's his platform.

182
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,580
Ship them all back before first making them
built a wall along the border for no pay.

183
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,700
Thank you very much get the fuck out.

184
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,160
But what the state senator fails to understand is...

185
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,410
the state runs the illegal labour.

186
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,080
Thrives on it.

187
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,120
Keeps costs down.

188
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,160
Keeps the wheels turning.

189
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,540
We bust that up
and we're fucked.

190
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,450
My words.

191
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Now I'm guessing you don't
have papers.

192
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,830
As you well know...

193
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,330
illegal immigrants like yourself...

194
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,040
will be forced out of the
country in alarming numbers

195
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,290
So for the sake of both
our people's.

196
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,540
The senator must die.

197
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,040
And for that. I will give you
150 thousand dollars cash.

198
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,910
Get someone else.

199
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,700
No time.

200
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,330
This job has to happen tomorrow.

201
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,500
I want you to take this cash,
do the job and disappear.

202
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,830
How long would it take you to get this kind of money?

203
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,410
5... 10... 15 years?

204
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,580
You can do a lot of good things with this.

205
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,200
You deserve it.

206
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,580
Now I can't make you do this.

207
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,790
But I can make damn sure something
happens to you if you don't.

208
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,500
Are you in?

209
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,910
Have a look at this:

210
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,450
Straight line design,

211
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,910
Laser designated scope.

212
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,200
You can shoot the pecker off
a mosquito at a thousand yards.

213
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,250
And keep the balls unruffled.

214
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,540
Machete?

215
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,660
That's only good if you wanna make a
brutal point.

216
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,540
But it's low tech. Completely
unsuited to our purposes.

217
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,870
Backup...

218
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,870
Here's your backup.

219
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,000
Me.

220
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,160
You call or text if you have any problems,

221
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,830
or delays. You need to be on that
roof by 1 pm sharp.

222
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,040
Now put a bullet in the senator
by 1:04pm.

223
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,120
Get up!

224
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,660
God damn April.

225
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,450
My business partner have very little tolerance
for bullshit.

226
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,290
This is a second operation in the last six months,

227
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,200
that I have to close down
because of your mentally...

228
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,950
I told you a thousand times.

229
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,250
You need something you come to me
directly.

230
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,330
You do not go to these labs.

231
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,660
You got something to say to me?

232
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,250
Sorry daddy.

233
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,700
What's this?

234
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,160
$150 thousand

235
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,000
Cash.

236
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,910
Are you out of your mind?

237
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,290
The Network got me across once.

238
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,330
Use this.

239
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,200
For the people you help.

240
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,500
I don't know how you know what you know.

241
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,410
But I'm glad I know you.

242
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,290
What would you want?

243
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,830
Here.

244
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,080
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Mr. Senator John McLaughlin.

245
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,080
I want to thank you all for coming
out today!

246
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,750
And I want to thank this forum from the bottom
of my heart.

247
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,450
Because we have been tested.

248
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,250
Tested by fire!

249
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,750
Our borders have been put to the test.
And let me tell you we have failed that test.

250
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,910
The aliens, the infiltrators, the outsiders...

251
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,540
They come right across by light of day,

252
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,620
by dark at night.

253
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,500
They'll bleed us. They'll parasites.

254
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,000
They'll bleed us til we're a city,

255
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,620
a county, a state.

256
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,200
a nation til we're all bled out.

257
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,450
Now make no mistake
we are at war.

258
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,540
Every time an illegal dances across
our border.

259
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,620
It is an act of aggression against
this sovereign state.

260
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,330
A covert act of terrorism.

261
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,120
Everywhere I go in this glorious state.

262
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,080
People are talking about change.

263
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,450
I say why change?

264
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,200
This is a great state founded
on the principles of liberty.

265
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,790
I don't want to change that.

266
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,370
Our rightful citizens are a hardworking Americans,

267
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,790
who have earned their paychecks...

268
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,000
by the grit of their gut and
the sweat of their brow!

269
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,250
I don't want to change that!

270
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,790
Change! That they want change!

271
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,040
Change the law!

272
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,000
Open the doors!

273
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,750
Red rover! Red rover!

274
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,410
Let the terrorist come over!

275
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,910
Let me tell you what change that will bring!

276
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,160
68 cents!

277
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,950
The jingle jangle of the pennies in your pocket.

278
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,120
Because the scavengers, the leeches,
the parasites,

279
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,750
are walking away with your money.

280
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,290
While you're left with the change.

281
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,000
So I wanna say one more thing.

282
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,160
Who you gonna vote for?

283
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,750
There!

284
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,750
Up there! I saw someone shot from up there!

285
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,000
Get him to Fort Briggs!

286
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,950
Roger! I'm on my way.

287
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,410
Go ahead.

288
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,580
Shoot him Nacho.

289
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,910
Cos right after that.

290
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,120
The three of us

291
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,700
Are gonna shoot one of you.

292
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,830
Shit!

293
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,120
Try it.

294
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,870
Go ahead... Pacho.

295
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,750
I'll grease your chips all
over this fucking alley.

296
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,330
This is fucking big.

297
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,540
This guy took a shot at a representative.

298
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,580
No! A Senator.

299
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,660
This is fucking high.

300
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,700
The guy can die and we caught him.

301
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,750
Hell we did!

302
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,040
And they'll gonna hang your ass
like Saddam!

303
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,580
Look I'm gonna call the boss
unless you wanna do it.

304
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, you go ahead.

305
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,830
We got the Mexican bird that fell off the rooftop!

306
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,830
Bring him to the basement.

307
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,910
He stills thinks we're cops.

308
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,750
Well of course he will think that.

309
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,450
We frisked him, we cuffed him, we
throw him in the car.

310
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,450
Apprehended him just like the
real cops do.

311
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,250
I didn't frisked him.

312
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,500
Yes, you did.

313
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,750
Man, I'm telling you I didn't...

314
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,700
Oh! Sweet Jesus.

315
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh! DAMN!

316
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,370
Shocking news this hour.

317
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,830
Senator John McLaughlin was shot
in the leg this afternoon by an unknown gunman.

318
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,660
The Senator was immediately driven to Parklane hospital,

319
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,580
where he was reportedly in good and
stable condition.

320
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,040
Video taken at the rally indicate the
gunman may have been of Mexican descent.

321
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,830
Senator McLaughlin have been
very vocal against immigration.

322
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,330
And campaigns for stricter border patrols.

323
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,500
Boss.

324
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,870
Video.

325
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,250
You see what I am sending you Mr. Torrez.

326
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,540
It's coming on my screen now.

327
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,540
That's campaign gold.

328
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,790
I put my contributions were for the Senator's re-election.

329
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,830
Not his retirement.

330
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,250
McLaughlin is in a guaranteed win.

331
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,080
And in a new session as promised,

332
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,700
he'll ramrod through everything we asked for.

333
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,290
Pause!

334
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,790
Go back.

335
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,830
Who's this?

336
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,870
Nobody.

337
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,750
A day labourer from the streets.

338
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,830
He won't be missed.

339
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,450
Is he dead?

340
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,330
Dead or dying on a rooftop.
That's what you mean.

341
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,000
What the fuck is it! Asshole...

342
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,330
Dead or dying?

343
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,250
He'll be dead within minutes.
I guarantee.

344
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,410
For your sake.

345
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,450
What?

346
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,580
It's me. It's done. I think he's toast.

347
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000
Don't think! Verify! Check the
morgue,

348
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,870
check the hospitals, check everywhere.

349
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,120
Most do not give illegals
standard treatment in hospitals.

350
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,910
But thou art with us.

351
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,330
Nobody knows you're here.

352
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,750
You were brought here under the name John Doe,

353
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,250
as a mere spectator.

354
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,750
Is that him?
Yes.

355
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,580
Dr. Felix wants to see him.

356
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,250
Quietly...

357
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,660
Did you see where the bullet rebound.

358
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,330
It was stopped by another bullet that
was fused and lodged there.

359
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,700
If he hadn't been shot before.
He'll be dead now.

360
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,160
There's actually a lesson in there somewhere.

361
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,830
I can feel your eyeballs on my uterus.

362
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,830
Woah, woah, woah, at least it's not on your colon.

363
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,580
Well, actually did you know that the...

364
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,580
the human intestines is ten times longer
than the length of the body?

365
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,410
Wait!

366
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,750
So the human intestines is
60 feet long?

367
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,750
It's true.

368
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,750
The hero has awoken!

369
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,910
My friend! You are safe, they are
from The Network.

370
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,200
They will take good care of you.

371
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,410
Leave him alone.

372
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,250
Hello, what can I do for you?

373
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,870
What can you do for me?

374
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,250
I'm looking for a gentleman
that was just brought in.

375
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,660
Probably into ICU.

376
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,750
Where might I find him?

377
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,580
You wanna go straight down
the hall, to your right...

378
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,120
Make a left, two rights and another left.

379
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,160
And you'll be right there.

380
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,910
You sure about that?

381
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,500
I'm going this way.

382
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,160
Someone is coming.

383
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,040
We got trouble.

384
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,750
Got another way outta here?

385
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,830
No other exits.

386
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,120
Oh... you don't wanna mess with that.

387
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,370
That's a skull scraper.

388
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,750
We use that to scrape the bones clean.

389
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,830
And those can cut through flesh
just like butter.

390
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,040
Pass that tank.

391
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,580
Hold it!

392
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,580
Boss ain't gonna like this.

393
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,870
What are we gonna tell him?

394
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,910
Ooops.

395
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,660
Evana.

396
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,200
I'm on my lunch break sir.

397
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,000
Lunch break is over. All hell's breaking loose,

398
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Some took a shot at Senator McLaughlin.

399
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,200
It was an illegal.

400
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,700
I'm watching it right now.

401
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,040
This amateur video was taken just outside
county hospital,

402
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,950
just after the failed attempt to
assassinate Senator John McLaughlin.

403
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,330
Authorities believe that this suspect
is extremely dangerous...

404
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,750
Son of a bitch...

405
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,450
No! not you sir.

406
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,080
I've seen him before.

407
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,250
Yes sir. I'm on my way.

408
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,040
He maybe in this country illegally.

409
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,080
And that he is of course to be considered
to be armed and extremely dangerous.

410
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,580
You're all over the TV! Cabron!
Come on get inside!

411
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,250
Hurry!

412
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,450
The shots fired on Senator
McLaughlin today maybe,

413
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,500
just the shot in the arm
his campaign needed.

414
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,580
New numbers indicate that he has
now taken a commanding,

415
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,830
led from the wake of today's incident.

416
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,000
Since today's shooting. Others agree that

417
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,500
border security should be heavily enforced.

418
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,950
Yes, hold the illegals responsible!
Close the border!

419
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,620
Eh... yeah!

420
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,000
Didn't you cross the border to
get here Jack?

421
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,500
Well, we're almost there.
If they close the border, fine by me.

422
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Nocha!

423
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,160
"Cona" Opinions should be like.

424
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,410
Waay!

425
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,660
You didn't have a choice,
Of course I believe you.

426
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,200
why else would you give me the money?

427
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,540
They'll be looking for your ass.

428
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,950
You'll be safe here.

429
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,000
Try not to bleed on the bed.

430
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,580
Are you...

431
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,250
..."She"?

432
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,410
If I were "She" do you think I would be
operating a Taco Shop?

433
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,750
"She" brings hope.

434
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,580
"She" rights the wrongs.

435
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,620
Unfortunately, "She's" a myth.

436
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,370
Just someone I made up to
led The Network.

437
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,370
At first, I just wanted to help
people get settled,

438
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,040
give them food, find them work.

439
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,120
Now there's a war
against us.

440
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,660
Von and his border vigilantes.

441
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,200
Hunting us down like dogs.

442
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,660
And there's no one there to stop them.

443
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,500
You can...

444
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,410
You're a fighter.

445
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,660
Only when there is something
worth fighting for.

446
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,790
Is there?

447
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,120
Always.

448
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,410
When the sun rises, you should be good.

449
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,410
Don't start something
that you can't finish.

450
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,120
Machete.

451
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
You know me?

452
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,910
I know the legend.

453
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,870
Maybe the legend's better.

454
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,330
I'll be the judge of that.

455
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,410
Where are you? Mr. Mysterious?

456
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,290
Oh my god...

457
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,830
Codename: Machete
Former Federal.

458
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,580
Gunning the Senator down in the street!

459
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,330
What on earth were they thinking?

460
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,370
Sometimes I worry about April and
what kinda world we're living here.

461
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,120
A fucked up world.

462
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,950
I would ought to wash your mouth out with soap.

463
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,910
Give me another that taco.

464
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,700
Someone took a shot at a senator.
What world would you call it?

465
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,250
A fucked up world.

466
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,830
Like two peas in a pod.

467
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,000
So! Hmm...

468
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,160
I think David is going to ask me
to marry him.

469
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,700
But I have my priorities.

470
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,660
School and a career.

471
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,790
Salsa!

472
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,410
Actually I was thinking more
about my modeling.

473
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,830
You are a very pretty girl April,

474
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,750
but that's tough enough to crack.

475
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,500
I know all about cracking nuts.

476
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,910
Do you even know how many hits I
get on my website?

477
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,580
You own a website? She has a
website? Did you know about this?

478
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,410
I know all about what the on-line public wants.

479
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,160
And they want ME!

480
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,330
All of ME!

481
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,660
That does it. I'm sending
you to a convent.

482
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,830
What?

483
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,830
He's loose. He got away.

484
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,750
God Damn! How hard is it for you to kill a
god damn day labourer?

485
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,660
You get to that corner where I
picked him up.

486
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,700
You find him!

487
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,000
Do IT!

488
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,200
Seen a big wagon?

489
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,500
No... No speak English.

490
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,790
Speak. 45?

491
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,910
Where's the tacos truck lady at?

492
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,830
Hey! I don't know man. I haven't seen
her this morning. She's late.

493
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,870
She...

494
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,000
You know where she lives...

495
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,540
Alright... go get him.

496
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,410
You're all over the god damn TV.

497
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,870
Get in!

498
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
Agents

499
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,700
You're the second beautiful
girl that picked me up today.

500
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,830
Exploding houses!

501
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,120
Bodies falling from the sky!

502
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,950
Jesus Christ Machete...

503
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,750
You're a walking SHIT MAGNET!

504
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,450
Ya! I know who you are...

505
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,330
I'm Santana Evira.

506
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,870
Immigration Customs and Enforcement [ICE].

507
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,500
ICE.

508
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,950
Fucking A! La Migra [immigration]...

509
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,450
Don't worry, I won't ship you back,
if you tell me what I need to know.

510
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,750
Working my way up.

511
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,500
I can't be busting people like tacos
stands anymore.

512
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Well, I'm probably related to half of them.

513
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,580
You need me more than I need you.

514
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,750
Come on.

515
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,750
You know all the cops in this state are
hunting you down for trying to kill a senator.

516
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,000
I wasn't gonna kill him.

517
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,370
Just gonna shoot him in the neck,

518
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,040
Stop him from saying all those
stupid things.

519
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,910
It was a set up.

520
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,700
There was another shooter there.

521
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,000
There was another shooter?

522
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,040
Who?

523
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,290
Drive!

524
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,700
Drive.

525
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,580
I know what they did to your family.

526
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,580
And if I were you I wouldn't trust
anyone neither,

527
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,870
but it's different here.

528
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,040
Laws are enforced.

529
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,410
And people control them.
Not drug lords.

530
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,910
The system works here...

531
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,080
Says you.

532
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I started working on the night shift
taking out the trash.

533
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,410
But I worked my way up.

534
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,250
As translator, assistant...

535
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,200
Now I'm special agent in
charge of investigations.

536
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,700
Sounds like they still got you
taking out the trash.

537
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,910
Let me take you in...

538
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,160
Put you into witness protection.

539
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,250
All you got to do is tell me who
hired you to take out the senator.

540
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,620
Fine.

541
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,500
Holy Shit.

542
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,500
You mean to tell me that a Mexican daily is a
god damn federale?

543
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,660
That's right, CIA, FBI, DEA, all
rolled in one mean fucking burrito.

544
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,290
Is this the man who you assigned to kill Machete?

545
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,410
Yes.

546
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,830
And so far you failed.

547
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,580
So far.

548
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,620
I'm sorry to see you have a high tolerance
for failure Bon nita.

549
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,540
I don't...

550
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:52,870
not bad

551
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,910
The last time we spoke you could have mentioned
that he was a god damn federale!

552
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,000
God Dammit!

553
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,790
Notoriously is hard to kill,
trust me.

554
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,830
I've tried.

555
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,700
Well, you didn't try with the guy I'm calling in.

556
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,750
The very best the great state of Texas has to offer.

557
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,160
Osiris Amanpour.

558
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,620
If Machete is captured alive.

559
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,830
He'll expose my entire operation.

560
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,910
You have 24 hours take him down,

561
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,500
or I'll come over there myself...

562
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,540
And I'll kill him myself.

563
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,080
Sorry, my friend.

564
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,660
My grandfather always says you
can solve any problem with food.

565
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:42,580
And you my friend,

566
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,540
have plenty of problems.

567
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,120
So who you working for?

568
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,000
Who wants the senator dead?

569
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,330
Is it The Network?

570
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,910
Luz?

571
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,250
She doesn't know anything about it.

572
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,790
Network either.

573
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,750
The man who hired me...

574
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:01,830
was a Mexican.

575
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,040
Really.

576
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,870
So he was just a random guy who says...

577
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:08,620
hey, wanna kill the senator today?

578
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,330
And you are like cool?

579
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,410
I was afraid he wanted receptive work.

580
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,660
Instead, he offered me $150,000
to kill the senator.

581
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,540
That's a lot of money.

582
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:21,620
So that's why you did it?

583
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,910
For the money.

584
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,660
Look, Machete.

585
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,120
You're not legal in this country.

586
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,250
And after what happened in Mexico
there is no way you're going home.

587
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,250
So basically, you're a man with no country.

588
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,000
And lucky for you. I can help you out.

589
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,290
Look at me.

590
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,290
I can get you papers.

591
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,410
But you've got to let me bring you in.

592
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,330
I'm gonna find the guy who did this.

593
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,910
And bring him to you.

594
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,290
Why should I trust you?

595
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,410
Because we are both cops.

596
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,120
I would tell you to stop, but
I know you took the bullets.

597
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:37,540
Luz!

598
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,160
Luz!

599
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,830
You wouldn't think they'll take me down
that easily did ya?

600
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,000
You're alive.
But your house man!

601
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,950
It was small...

602
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,910
I've got something to show you guys,
come on...

603
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,540
Told you they were gunning for us.

604
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,870
Who knows what they'll gonna do next.

605
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,580
Holy shit, Luz!

606
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,080
I didn't now that you were this loaded.

607
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,000
You got more heat than the Popos [police].

608
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,540
It's a good start, but we need a lot more.

609
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,580
Need it for what?

610
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,330
La Revoluzion. [The Revolution].

611
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,000
Van and his men are coming for us.

612
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,620
We need to be ready.

613
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,200
I'm not gonna be around forever.

614
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:33,250
If anything happens, you need to tell Machete
the people need him.

615
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,080
Who exactly is this Machete?

616
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,250
That's him...

617
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,910
he's the one.

618
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,250
Hands up!

619
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,080
Against the wall.

620
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,370
All of you, move it!

621
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,200
Where's Machete?

622
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,910
Shit. She knows. Man!

623
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,080
Amigo's gonna deport our ass back.

624
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:58,950
Nobodies deporting anybody.

625
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,750
Machete already told me you guys weren't
involved in the shooting.

626
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:06,830
Although... I should probably
check the "carnitas".

627
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,250
For lead!

628
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,540
What is this place anyway?

629
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,250
Welcome to The Network.

630
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,500
These are some of the people that I've help.

631
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,910
Help them cross,

632
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,410
Got them jobs,

633
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,620
then make sure that they do their part.

634
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,870
And this?

635
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,450
These are the guys trying to stop us.

636
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:37,580
Van Jackson and his Border Vigilantes.

637
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:41,330
They started off with a couple of deer rifles
and a warped sense of justice.

638
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,120
Then in the last year they've grown.

639
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,620
More guns, more men.

640
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,290
Who's funding them?

641
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,200
Whoever it is, is making a mess
of our operation.

642
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,330
And these?

643
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,910
Missing.

644
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:00,540
They are supposed to have crossed.
But I have no way to track them.

645
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,370
How deep does your operation go?

646
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:03,290
Deep.

647
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:08,950
All types, all races.
Lawyers, priests, doctors, homeboys...

648
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,750
That's why they call it "The Network".

649
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,790
The way we see it.
People risk everything to get here.

650
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,330
The system doesn't work.

651
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,120
It's broken.

652
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,160
So we created our own.

653
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,290
You gonna burn us? huh?

654
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,830
Turn us all in?

655
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,160
No.

656
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,200
I'm gonna walk away and pretend
I didn't see any of this.

657
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,410
Tell Machete I'm looking for him!

658
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,410
I am a man of faith,

659
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,370
I took a vow of peace.

660
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,950
And I don't shoot anymore.

661
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,580
And you don't shoot any less either.

662
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,080
I don't see you or heard
from you in three years,

663
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:05,080
And now you want me to
help you kill all these men?

664
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,250
Yes, brother...

665
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,750
I mean, Padre [Father].

666
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,290
I'll see what I can do.

667
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,790
I want you to say 10 our fathers
and 10 hail Marys.

668
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:25,450
Light a candle for mom...

669
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,040
For funerals.
A little side business.

670
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,330
I have these installed
when too many things...

671
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,830
started walking away from the
altar and collection plates.

672
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:41,120
Imagine if we have these kinda setup
for all the federales.

673
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,790
This is how you get the bad guys now.

674
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,250
You catch them on video.

675
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,120
Cuban?

676
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,450
Mexican.

677
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,290
Yeah, I got some of that.

678
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,910
I've got something I want you to see

679
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,000
Rest assure he will be caught.

680
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,580
It is the first shot of the war that...

681
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,830
we didn't ask for.

682
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,120
Nice way to find out your brother's in town.

683
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,750
Right there.

684
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:13,870
That's the guy that hired me.

685
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,200
Michael Booth?

686
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:17,910
He's McLaughlin's aid or some shit.

687
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,040
You know him?

688
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,580
Yeah... he comes in for confession
all the time.

689
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,330
Lots of impure thoughts.

690
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:30,330
Mostly about his daughter.

691
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,160
I guess I'm cheaper than a shrink [psychiatrist].

692
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:35,450
Here's his file.

693
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,120
Once he started talking about
his connection to the cartels.

694
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,540
I figured. It'll come in handy.

695
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,330
I bet McLaughlin
doesn't even know that most of Booth's,

696
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,910
business are just a
front for his drug trade.

697
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:49,410
What I don't understand is why he
hired you to kill his own boss.

698
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:50,410
Don't know.

699
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,370
Gonna find out.

700
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,540
It's not safe for you to be here.

701
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,120
Not looking for safe.

702
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,950
No I mean it's not safe
for me for YOU to be here.

703
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,500
I absolve you of all your sins,

704
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,540
Now get the fuck out!

705
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,750
Okay, bro...

706
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,660
But I'm borrowing your car.

707
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,290
Why are you complaining about a weak neck,

708
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:25,580
I would said you should fucking do some sit-ups.

709
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,620
Hey... hey, hey boss?

710
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,870
Who're you?

711
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,790
The new gardener

712
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,000
Gardener?

713
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,330
I'm just fucking with you, chief.

714
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,910
It's Hungarian, it means
that I'll kill you, you little monkey.

715
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:50,750
You know what?

716
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,000
There is a large pile
shit in the back.

717
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,500
You can go clean that up. Alright!

718
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,120
Make sure you do a good job.

719
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,500
Make sure you wipe those boots off!

720
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,330
He's carrying shit in the house.

721
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,870
Did you ever notice that you let go
Mexicans into your home...

722
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,330
just because he's got
gardening tools?

723
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:08,160
I mean, no questions asked.

724
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,080
You just let him right in.

725
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,370
He could have a chainsaw
or a machete...

726
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,330
God! Jesus!

727
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,500
Stop it!

728
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
Dammit, that hurts!

729
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,160
If your father ever saw me, 2 minutes.

730
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,080
Mom, everyone is gonna see you do this.

731
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,120
it's the Internet.

732
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,000
This is what my viewers wanna see on-line.

733
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,160
Hey! You not the usual guy.

734
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:13,580
He looks good to me.

735
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,500
Oh don't be shy, come on in!

736
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,620
Access denied.

737
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,830
What the fuck did you bring them here for?

738
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,410
Didn't you hear a god damn word I said?

739
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:18,790
Want me to dump them?

740
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,200
What? No... no.

741
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,870
I would make good use of them.

742
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:25,120
The Church can always use good people.

743
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:38,250
June?

744
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,200
April?

745
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,500
Where's my wife and daughter?

746
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,500
Woah... one family at a time.

747
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,580
It's Osiris...

748
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,660
Machete has a Amano [brother]..

749
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,790
or should I say, 

750
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:26,450
...Padre [Father].

751
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:32,950
State Senator John McLaughlin took a
vow to defend the Constitution of this State.

752
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:33,790
Now!

753
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,330
he's taken a bullet for us.

754
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,450
And this is that bullet.

755
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,370
Vote to re-elect Sen. John McLaughlin.

756
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:50,370
I'm John McLaughlin
and I approve of this message.

757
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,620
Paid for by the Committee to
re-elect of John McLaughlin.

758
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,250
Sorry ma'am.

759
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,580
Damn new phone.

760
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,120
Should put on the vibrator.

761
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,910
Can you help me do that?

762
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,540
Pervert.

763
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,410
Yeah?

764
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:32,250
Senator?

765
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,080
It's Van.

766
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:38,040
I hear you got a problem maybe we can fix.

767
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,370
Don't call me on this line again.
I'll call you.

768
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:42,750
Now you said it yourself Senator
war has begun.

769
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,370
Helter Skelter is here.

770
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,000
Your army awaits further orders.

771
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,950
Got to be respectful now.

772
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,080
No shit slaves.

773
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:54,580
What about the shooter?

774
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,290
He's still out there?

775
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,290
There's nothing I would like more,

776
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,540
then to see that Mexican dance the bolero
with the end of the rope.

777
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,700
He's gone underground for sure.

778
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,580
Let's say we go underground.

779
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,250
And get him.

780
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,000
You find the Network and you
find the shooter.

781
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,080
Call our special friend.

782
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,540
Tell him we're gonna need a helluva more firepower.

783
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,370
If he is serious about wanting
that border shut down.

784
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,250
Fix your damn gun.

785
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:24,790
Thanks.

786
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,870
Our friend is up.

787
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,000
Where the fuck have you been?

788
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:48,290
You could at least text-ed me.

789
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,660
Machete don't text.

790
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,000
But Machete get evidence.

791
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,580
Thanks for coming back.

792
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:10,910
There is no way that McLaughlin is getting
elected, unless something big happens.

793
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,700
Can you imagine if someone shot the senator,
and that someone was a Mexican.

794
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,750
The public would elect him to be president.

795
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,790
It's not a sin if someone clinch
the senator in the leg is it?

796
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,040
So, this is footage from
your brother's confession?

797
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,450
There's no open commandant against
thou shall not wing a man.

798
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,290
Is there Padre?

799
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,040
But these files over here.

800
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,660
You got from Booth's office.

801
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,200
They're encrypted.

802
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,500
Is my little girl April... I spent nights...

803
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,450
You not going to think it's that easy,
Do you?

804
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:50,160
I just wish that April
saw me as more a real man.

805
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,450
Holy shit...

806
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,450
You're right. The Network is not behind it.

807
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,250
This is something. A helluva lot bigger.

808
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:11,830
You've got enough here to bring down everyone.

809
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,660
The Senator, Booth...

810
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,120
Van...

811
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,500
Look here.

812
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,910
There's drug money financing
the Senator's campaign.

813
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,080
Rogelio Torrez.

814
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,410
Torrez...

815
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,830
He's the drug kingpin who's been trying
to gain control of the drug trade.

816
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,160
this must be the border fence
McLaughlin wants to build.

817
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,080
See this?

818
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:48,330
These markings show the weakest spots.

819
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,750
It all makes sense now.

820
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,500
Torrez wants to get Senator McLaughlin re-elected,

821
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,750
so that he can build a border fence that he
can control.

822
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,870
You did good work Machete.

823
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:03,370
I bet you're a great cop.

824
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,950
The best.

825
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,330
And modest too.

826
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,040
I'm dry.

827
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,120
Get up.

828
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,750
Why?

829
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:21,500
Because you're drunk.

830
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,500
Come be with me.

831
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:55,370
Speak English?

832
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,120
Depends on the question.

833
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,580
We know that you hired that Mexican to kill our senator.

834
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,790
You the Network? Ain't cha?

835
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,750
Hell! You're behind everything.

836
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,750
That's not how we work.

837
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:13,750
But if you want war...

838
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,160
I will give it to you.

839
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,410
How about an eye for an eye?

840
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,120
You burned your last burrito.

841
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,660
You got to get better at this, Billy.

842
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,080
Please, Father, have mercy.

843
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,700
God has mercy, I don't.

844
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:58,290
Hello Padre [Father].

845
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:11,290
The Blood of Christ?
Taste like Merlot to me.

846
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,830
Where is he?

847
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,080
He's everywhere.

848
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,200
Talk Padre.

849
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:25,870
Sing me one of those Mexican hymns
like a chroming arch boy.

850
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,620
Go to hell.

851
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:44,250
You want to be a martyr?
I'm good at making martyrs.

852
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,790
Like Senator McLaughlin?

853
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,500
That's right.

854
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:51,500
We have to get that Senator re-elected.
Get that fence built along the border.

855
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,410
before it is too late.

856
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,870
You really hate our kind that much?

857
01:06:56,250 --> 01:07:00,250
No padre, I hate declining profits that much.

858
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,790
An open border allows supply of flowing too easily.

859
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:06,040
Drives our prices down.

860
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:10,870
Restricted border limits supply.
Drives the prices up.

861
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,160
Higher price, higher profits.

862
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,120
You are drunk with power,
even putting the hit on your own boss.

863
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,870
Just to boost his election numbers.

864
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:27,080
Last chance, amigo.

865
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:31,330
Where's Machete and
where are my wife and daughter?

866
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,450
In hell.

867
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,290
Then give them my best.

868
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:12,200
A real gentleman.

869
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,080
Comfortable...

870
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:36,580
Are they the same?

871
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:41,660
They want you dead too.

872
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,160
My brother.

873
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:45,910
Wait!

874
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,330
How do you text with this thing?

875
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,450
I thought Machete don't text.

876
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:33,330
Machete improvise.

877
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:40,660
Where're you going?

878
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,910
Take out the trash.

879
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,330
Machete, sent me a text.

880
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,450
What's it say?

881
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:14,830
You just fuck with the wrong Mexican.

882
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,700
He's coming after us.

883
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
No, he's coming after you.

884
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,620
You got some news?

885
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:26,450
Yes.

886
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,450
His brother's is dead.

887
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:30,910
You killed a priest.

888
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:31,950
Congratulations.

889
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,450
That's right Booth, I'm in your town.

890
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:39,750
And I'm gonna kill Machete.

891
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,620
And you're gonna watch it happen.

892
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,580
And it will be the last you see.

893
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:45,660
Wait a second.

894
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:48,200
There's a girl from ICE.

895
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,830
She's with Machete and they have a file on me,

896
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:53,330
on you, on McLaughlin, on everybody.

897
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:57,200
She can make things
very difficult for us.

898
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:59,290
Where is she?

899
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:02,580
You know, I've been thinking.

900
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:05,120
We let these people into our homes,

901
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,160
Watch our kids,

902
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,700
park our cars.

903
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,080
But we won't let them, into our country.

904
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,790
Does that make any sense to you?

905
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,580
Hey! That wetback whack
the both of us over the head.

906
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,910
In case you forgot, he shot me in the leg.

907
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,410
I thought Jango shot you?

908
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,330
I don't want to hear that story again.

909
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:25,370
Think about it.

910
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,250
He wasn't here for us.

911
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,750
He's here for the boss.

912
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:32,910
I've been watching the boss. This guy
is a real scumbag.

913
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,040
Hey, hey, hey.

914
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,370
Where's your loyalty at?

915
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,870
Did you hear that?

916
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,250
It's weed whacker.

917
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:52,120
He's back!
Spread out.

918
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:53,580
Spread out NOW!

919
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,160
Alpha unit, you copy?

920
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,040
Quit!

921
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,000
Anybody report.
You hear me?

922
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,620
Anybody?

923
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,290
Where's Booth?

924
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:40,950
The senator, he's with the senator.

925
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,830
I have a GPS.

926
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:45,080
Tracks his limo.

927
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,250
Hey! Don't kill me, please, take it.

928
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:59,370
That's Spanish, "I let you live. "

929
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,450
Thanks Chief.

930
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,660
Let me see if I am hearing you right.

931
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:08,790
One of the city's most prominent businessmen.

932
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:09,830
A Texas vigilante.

933
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:14,620
The most notorious drug kingpin of Mexico
and a state senator,

934
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,790
are all conspiring to enact stricter immigration laws?

935
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,660
I know how it sounds, but I have Booth
on video committing a murder.

936
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,830
I have tons of confessions.

937
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:23,660
I mean it's...

938
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:29,500
Listen to yourself, this man is an illegal alien,
ILLEGAL as in against the law.

939
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:34,040
Well, there's the law and there's what's right.

940
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,830
I'm gonna do what's right.

941
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:00,660
<i>We are live from the Church of Hope
where just moments ago.</i>

942
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,750
<i>Police discovered a gruesome murder.</i>

943
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:05,250
<i>The body of a priest
was found nailed to the cross.</i>

944
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:08,160
<i>And witnesses descriptions of
a man leaving the church.</i>

945
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:11,370
<i>Match those of a gunman wanted for the
shooting of Senator McLaughlin.</i>

946
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:14,200
Excuse me, honey's just shut the door
and give us a moment.

947
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:16,370
<i>On the street, they call him Machete.</i>

948
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:18,660
<i>Who is he, what is he?</i>

949
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,580
<i>And will he ever be brought down?</i>

950
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,080
Where the fuck have you been?

951
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,160
This story is burning the whole fucking
town to the ground.

952
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,830
It's giving us a war that I
know we can win!

953
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,830
He's a cockroach,
sooner or later he'll be squashed.

954
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:30,330
Oh, oh, yeah!
Well, this roach has got AK-47's

955
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:32,580
and he's laying waste to everything
that gets in his fucking path.

956
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,410
I'm taking care of it.

957
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,370
They scheduled me for release in
a couple of minutes...

958
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,410
I can't walk outta here like a fucking piñata
waiting to get whacked.

959
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,580
The man they are calling Machete...<i>
- We're ready for you Senator.</i>

960
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:46,500
It's show time...

961
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,200
You forgot your cane, sir.

962
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:56,330
Ladies and gentlemen,

963
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:00,370
Senator John McLaughlin.

964
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:07,870
Thank you, thank you.

965
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,450
This freehold bandito
is not any closer to justice.

966
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,790
I urge this criminal and
those that are hiding him,

967
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,040
to turn him in.

968
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,500
He's destroying us from the inside,

969
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,330
like the plague that he is...

970
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,250
We must not let
terrorist win.

971
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,200
Senator?

972
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,580
There are reports implicating,

973
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:33,200
your adviser as having orchestrating
the assassination attempt.

974
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,500
Would you care to comment?

975
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,700
What now?

976
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:45,410
<i>Want to be a martyr?
I am good at making martyrs.</i>

977
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:47,330
<i>Like Senator McLaughlin?</i>

978
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,410
<i>That's right.</i>

979
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:51,660
<i>We have to get that Senator re-elected.
Get that fence built along the border.</i>

980
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:52,700
<i>Before it's too late.</i>

981
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,790
Or do you care to comment,

982
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:56,330
on the shooting that happened

983
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:58,910
on the border
on the night of July 22nd?

984
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,540
<i>Who is gonna stop us?</i>

985
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,450
<i>I am!</i>

986
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:05,620
<i>Welcome to the America.</i>

987
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,620
<i>You catch all that?</i>

988
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,910
<i>Burn me a DVD. Behind our supporters
are going to like that!</i>

989
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,000
<i>A lot!</i>

990
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,910
How about your connections with drug king pin
Rogelio Torrez?

991
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:20,910
No further comment.

992
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:21,910
I'm sorry, I just...

993
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:24,410
Or the border vigilantes
involved in running drugs?

994
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,200
I think I'm having a heart attack.

995
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,950
God dammit if you don't relax
you will have one.

996
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,410
You jeopardize more than my career,

997
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:44,450
We got cut back.

998
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,080
He could have killed me.

999
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,500
Not with that scope.

1000
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,410
You stupid son of a bitch...

1001
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:53,290
You pulled something like that
without consulting me?

1002
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,950
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

1003
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,910
I'm the one who got your campaign financed.

1004
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,500
Made you a political powerhouse.
Your own personal Jesus.

1005
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,040
So, you better get down on your knees
and start praying for me to save your soul

1006
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,500
Because I'm the only one who can
at this point!

1007
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:21,000
Get the fuck out.

1008
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,370
God dammit man,
why don't you just die?

1009
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:56,830
It's gonna work.

1010
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,040
We could have been rich.

1011
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,160
Torrez.

1012
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,040
Was stopping all those cheap shit
from across the border.

1013
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:02,870
Did I tell you that?

1014
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:05,910
Can lead more than a tired pendejo [fool]
with a dime bag and a dream.

1015
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,160
So we financed Van.

1016
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:09,160
Giving them men guns.

1017
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,160
The Vigilantes.

1018
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,040
Our own little private border patrol.

1019
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:16,000
But Torrez wanted all that chelada.

1020
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:19,250
So I thought why not let politics
do what guns couldn't.

1021
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,580
Funny things is that I thought
it would be a peaceful solution.

1022
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:27,540
None of that tortured taco.

1023
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:29,910
Wait, wait...

1024
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:31,500
Torrez is looking for you.

1025
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,540
You find Van, you'll find Torrez.

1026
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,540
Please...

1027
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:38,540
Tell me...

1028
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,250
where are my wife and daughter?

1029
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,540
With God.

1030
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:47,080
I guess I won't be seeing them.

1031
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,160
Fuck! My head...

1032
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,870
What is this shit?

1033
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,000
That asshole drugged us.

1034
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:11,870
Where are our clothes?

1035
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:14,700
Call daddy.

1036
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,540
It's June,

1037
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,580
and April.

1038
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,950
We're very sorry.

1039
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,580
Your husband is dead.

1040
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,750
He's what?

1041
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:40,580
Senator McLaughlin shot him.

1042
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,290
Secure that weapon!
Yeah!

1043
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:05,250
<i>Vigilante leader, Van Jackson has
refused declined comment,</i>

1044
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,750
<i>after startling revelations of their connections,</i>

1045
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:08,830
<i>to the Mexican drug cartels.</i>

1046
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,620
This is Van...

1047
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,580
I'm coming in.

1048
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,750
We're all over the news senator...

1049
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,250
You compromised everything we worked for.

1050
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,160
There is only one way this is gonna end.

1051
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,250
smoke em' out.

1052
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:21,750
But I wanna put a bullet in his head myself.

1053
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,080
And just how you're figuring on doing that?

1054
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:27,790
I'm joining you boys for one last ride along.

1055
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:45,370
Machete.

1056
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,080
Where's Luz?

1057
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,410
She's gone, man.

1058
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,290
Vigilante's got her.

1059
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,120
And now they're after you.

1060
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:56,580
You gotta lead us to fight,

1061
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,830
it's what Luz would have want!

1062
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:59,290
Not your war.

1063
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,580
I maybe adopted as'say.

1064
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,750
No shit.

1065
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,750
What's going on, not right!

1066
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:06,910
We just wanna help, bro.

1067
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,700
I don't need your help.

1068
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,160
Not us?

1069
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,790
Then who?

1070
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:26,410
Whatever you need.

1071
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,450
Build it, strip it, chop it.

1072
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,750
Garage's is yours, Homez...

1073
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,080
Got guns?

1074
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,120
Si [yes].

1075
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:35,870
We missiles, machine guns.

1076
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:38,200
We fight Van, we fight Torrez.

1077
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,250
We take em' all down at once.

1078
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:41,830
Hey everyone!

1079
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,750
Listen UP!

1080
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:43,790
Now we got some work to do!

1081
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:53,620
Does anyone knows who's Machete?

1082
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,410
Does anyone knows who's Machete?

1083
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:58,450
Please.

1084
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,410
Machete needs your help

1085
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:02,120
or he'll be killed just like Luz,

1086
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,160
just like Padre [Father].

1087
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,910
Listen to me!

1088
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,540
Yes, I am a woman of the law,

1089
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:15,000
and there are lots of laws!

1090
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,370
But if they don't offer us justice,

1091
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:19,330
Then they aren't law!

1092
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,000
They are just lines drawn in the sand

1093
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,410
by men who would stand on your backs.

1094
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:26,200
For power and glory.

1095
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:29,580
Men who deserves to be cut down.

1096
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,250
It's time to erase the meyette the line!

1097
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:36,580
And show these cabronese the
true meaning of true law!

1098
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:39,750
We didn't cross the border.

1099
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,910
The border crossed us!

1100
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,120
Viva la Machete!

1101
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:47,830
Viva la Machete!

1102
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:50,200
You're Machete's girl.

1103
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,410
I know,

1104
01:23:51,410 --> 01:23:53,330
<i>unless you're his type.

1105
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:54,700
What type is that?

1106
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:56,750
Dead.

1107
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:13,290
<i>Earlier today, Senator McLaughlin
allegedly pulled a gun</i>

1108
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:16,910
<i>on his adviser Michael Booth
and shot him twice in the chest.</i>

1109
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,120
<i>After an altercation following the disaster
reveal earlier this afternoon</i>

1110
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,160
<i>of the senator's connections to the
Mexican drug king pin Rogelio Torrez.</i>

1111
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,540
Network!

1112
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,870
<i>According to recent reports,
McLaughlin's re-election campaign</i>

1113
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:31,200
<i>was been funded entirely by Mr. Torrez.</i>

1114
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:32,830
Machete!

1115
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:37,750
Networks said the senator calling
the vigilantes to kill you.

1116
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,290
And Agent Santana,

1117
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,410
she's been captured by Torrez!

1118
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:45,290
All hands and the armory to load up.

1119
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:47,330
Time to roll out!

1120
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,040
Give me a vest and a rifle.

1121
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,160
My great grand daddy...

1122
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:04,040
did not give his life at at The Alamo
so that we could

1123
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,830
sell off our nation to some
backstabbing politicians.

1124
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,120
What are you talking about?

1125
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:10,830
You lied to us,

1126
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:13,000
you paid that Mexican to put on an act.

1127
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
To fool the people.

1128
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:16,330
And my pool of posse.

1129
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:17,500
Now he's on his way...

1130
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,040
And no doubt bringing a whole
mess of bean eaters.

1131
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:23,160
You seem to be quite fond of Booth, Senator.

1132
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,250
You've been in the desert too long amigo...

1133
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:27,370
Well let's see just how this blows your skirt up?

1134
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:31,750
We're gonna simulcast your execution
for the crime of treason.

1135
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,450
No shit stains.

1136
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:42,330
Guys! They're on their way!

1137
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,080
Get to your posts!

1138
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:57,580
Time for your last testament.

1139
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:02,250
No second takes.

1140
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,910
Just get your lines right.

1141
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,700
Hold the line...

1142
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:42,250
I have desecrated the oath of our first...

1143
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:47,250
and I am a traitor deserving death.

1144
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:48,250
Ready?

1145
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:51,620
Fucking parasites!

1146
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,540
Fucking terrorists!

1147
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,580
Aim.

1148
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:14,330
Oh shit.

1149
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:15,950
Two of you stay with him...

1150
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:17,000
The rest of you outside.

1151
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,290
Oh shit!

1152
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:34,870
Fuck em up!

1153
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:17,410
How is your eye?

1154
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:18,410
What eye?

1155
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:04,620
If you want to survive your own war,

1156
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,040
you better become Mexican real fast.

1157
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,000
You got enemies on all sides, Senator.

1158
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,950
Who can you trust?

1159
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:19,410
You aim to take down those boys?

1160
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:22,790
Then I'm with you.

1161
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:59,120
Take out that Mexican!

1162
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,410
God Dammit!

1163
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,830
Van, we're fucked! We
gotta get outta here.

1164
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:14,910
Get outta here!

1165
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:34,620
Sister...

1166
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:36,450
Please...

1167
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:38,950
I've done wrong...

1168
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,660
I've done terrible this life...

1169
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:43,080
And I'm not even from here
I hate Texas.

1170
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,120
I hate the heat.

1171
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:46,540
Give me my last rites.

1172
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,950
In the name of my father.

1173
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,580
My father...

1174
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,250
April.

1175
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:04,410
Forgot the rest.

1176
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:06,830
You never learn to stay down!
Punieta [jerk off].

1177
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:09,290
So I guess I have to teach you.

1178
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,330
Got something to say?

1179
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:20,790
Now you got something to say?

1180
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,660
Back the fuck up and watch.

1181
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,290
Okay Punieta!

1182
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,370
Adelante [Forward].

1183
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:57,660
We used to be federale's together
kanna [root],

1184
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:58,700
Remember?

1185
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:04,870
We were brothers...

1186
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:06,660
But you?

1187
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,870
went for the honor.

1188
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:10,500
Pendejo [coward].

1189
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:21,290
Then I went for the power.

1190
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:25,500
We killed a lot
of bad guys together.

1191
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:29,330
Now I'm the bad guy.

1192
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,330
What do you wanna do?
hermanito [little brother]?

1193
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,410
Look at your Machete now. Cabrón

1194
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:52,040
He's gonna kill him.

1195
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:55,330
No he's not.

1196
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,330
He's Machete.

1197
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,330
No point.

1198
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:14,910
Cap Puto [fuck].

1199
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:20,290
You know I could kill you now
very easily.

1200
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:22,250
Believe me.

1201
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,660
This is nothing.

1202
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,660
This ain't shit.

1203
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,160
But...

1204
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:36,080
I know you'll just be waiting for me in hell.

1205
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,620
So...

1206
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,290
I think I'll say goodbye.

1207
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,290
Fuck it.

1208
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,660
There's one!

1209
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,620
God damn cockroach

1210
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,750
Can't speak English. Can you boy?

1211
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:42,450
Welcome to America.

1212
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:33,870
What? You wanna see my ID?

1213
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:34,910
Don't bother.

1214
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:37,660
I've got something better.

1215
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:41,580
I called in a few favors.

1216
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:42,620
Look at this.

1217
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,830
Got you all the right papers.

1218
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:47,290
You can start over now.

1219
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,450
Be a real person.

1220
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,580
Why do I want to be a real person?

1221
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,870
I'm already a myth.

1222
01:39:55,870 --> 01:39:57,080
Where will you go?

1223
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:01,160
Everywhere.

1224
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:07,540
Can I ride with you?
