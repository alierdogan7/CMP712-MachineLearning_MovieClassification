Alex: <i>It all started six
months ago at the FBI Academy.</i>

00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:07,665
You were willing to die today
for everyone in that room.

3
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:09,617
You said your son came at you from behind.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,739
How can you be certain it was him?

5
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:13,509
I never said "I love you"
when I really wanted to.

gonna feel when she finds out.

9
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:20,008
She already knows. Yeah, I told her.

10
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:21,409
I'm the one who planned Grand Central.

11
00:00:21,444 --> 00:00:23,578
Somebody stole my plans and
used them for themselves.

12
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:25,313
We know that the bomber
planned their attack

13
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:27,015
around the Democratic National Convention.

14
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,418

<i>No more noise.</i>

<i>hoping to show that New York may be down</i>

35
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:23,061
<i>but she is not out.</i>

36
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,739
You're wasting time down here
pretending to interview me.

37
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:27,073
Miranda: It's not a waste of time.

38
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,009
It's why you're still in
the command center with us.

39
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:30,243
We have to keep up appearances.

40
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:31,611
There's still a bomber out there.

41
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,446
With me in custody,
no one's looking for them.

42

The FBI's always on alert.

43

What, the standard "if you see something,
say something"?

That's not gonna cut it here, Liam.

45

Whatever the FBI is doing, it's not enough.

46
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:44,431
The real bomber is inside the Bureau.

47
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:47,293
It gives them special access,
knowledge of procedures.

48
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:49,028
It allows them to manipulate the system.

49
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:49,996
- They can do what...
- Your...

50
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,931
Alex, your guilty plea allowed you

51
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:54,847
to be remanded to FBI custody for 24 hours.

52
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:57,670
After that, we have to
deliver you to federal prison.

53
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:01,907
Which means if we don't
find a second bomb or bomber

54
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:04,326
in the next four hours, you'll be serving

55
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:06,574
a life sentence for a
crime you didn't commit.

56
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:08,080
I have a friend in the C.I.A.

57
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,128
He's willing to extract
you out of the country.

58

No. I'm not running again.

59

Not with so many people's lives in danger.

60
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:16,548
Look, you need to find that bomb<i> now.</i>

61
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,254
- And you need more manpower to do it.
- That's impossible.

62
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:20,959
The entire top tier of the Bureau's in town

63

the world that we prevailed.

64

And no one but a handful of
people know that we haven't.

convention center for tonight

If there's something to be found,

68
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,251
they'll find it.

Are you doubting me now?

We have to go back upstairs.
We've been gone too long.

72

00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:19,507
Ugh. It's Nimah. She's in Miranda's office.

356
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:22,072
You don't know who that was with Ryan.

357
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,686
- He's in L.A., right?
- Yeah.

358
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,414
Doesn't he have, like, three sisters there?

359
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,027
Guys, that did not sound like a sister.

360
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,156
All right, get up.

361
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,520
Get up. Come on.

362
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:31,854
Vasquez.

363
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,656
Everyone stand on one foot.

364
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,791
- What? [Chuckles]
- Just do it.

365
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,026
[Laughs] Come on.

366
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:39,595
Whoever's the most sober
is gonna get in their car,

367
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,796
drive us to the Old Settler,

368
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:44,100
where whatever D.E.A. trainee or marine

369
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:46,878
who wants to buy our
midnight kisses can do so

370
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,106
for the price of cheap
drinks and good conversation.

371
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:49,771
[Knock on door]

372
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,892
Maybe not even <i>good</i> conversation.

373
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:53,349
[Laughter]

374
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:54,577
Whoop! Caleb!

375
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:57,179
Don't worry. I'm not "Magic Mike" -ing you.

376
00:13:57,655 --> 00:13:58,347
Nice.

377
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,824
When I got home,
instead of the normal, intimate

378
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:02,280
Haas family holiday bloodletting,

379
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,708
there were 200 people at my house

380
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,922
and a tux laid out on my bed.

381
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:08,490
I panicked and I fled.

382
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:10,626
But you still put the tux on.

383
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:11,760
Yeah.

384
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:13,228
Do you see this?

385
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:15,163
I can't go back there alone.

386
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,398
I get that you don't want to be around

387
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,767
someone's happy family right now,
but I swear to you,

388
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:19,968
there's nothing familial about it,

389
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:21,603
and no one's gonna be happy.

390
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,868
Except for<i> me</i> if I have you by my side.

391
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:26,029
What do you say?

392
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:28,543
[Inhales sharply]

393
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:31,388
I'll only go if<i> they</i> can come, too.

394
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:39,220
Simon wouldn't have been able
to magnetize his key at home.

395
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:40,822
19 people asked for their key cards

396
00:14:40,857 --> 00:14:43,024
to be recoded within the past 12 hours.

397
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,527
Nine of these were on the list
of donor rooms at Simon's.

398
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:47,228
Divide and conquer.

399
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:48,830
Stay on comms.

400
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:51,933
FBI!

401
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:52,734
Clear.

402
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,202
FBI!

403
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,038
Clear.

404
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:58,632
FBI!

405
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:00,141
Simon!

406
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:01,843
I don't know if this
thing is remote-controlled

407
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,144
or movement-controlled.

408
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,479
I don't know anything.

409
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:06,681
I just know I woke up with it in my hands.

410
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:08,817
But I'm pretty sure if I take
my fingers off this trigger,

411
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,985
this whole building's gonna blow.

412
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:14,996
- Nimah: Alex!
- Over here!

413
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,481
Careful.

414
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,285
The last thing I remember
is walking into my house

415
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,519
and someone grabbed me.

416
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,488
When I woke up,
this thing was taped to my hands.

417
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,584
But I'm sweating so much

418
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,565
that the tape's starting to get loose,

419
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:29,307
- Okay.
- And I'm afraid my finger's gonna slip.

420
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,439
- You're okay.
- I need you to help me.

421
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,318
We saw your workshop...
The blueprints, the key card.

422
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,799
Somebody's framing me.

423
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,537
All right? Just like they framed Alex.

424
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:39,469
Look, find Oren.
He can tell you it wasn't me.

425
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:40,737
- Alex: Simon...
- He can tell you! Just find Oren!

426
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,439
- Simon...
- Elias: Simon, stop.

427
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,841
You came to me yesterday,
asking me to represent you

428
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:46,576
so you'd have attorney/client privilege.

429
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,211
You asked me about extradition laws,

430
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:49,609
about flight manifests.

431
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:51,097
- You were going to run.
- No!

432
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:52,048
I wanted to make sure I wasn't gonna spend

433
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,944
the rest of my life in
prison for my stolen plans.

434
00:15:55,124 --> 00:15:57,952
I didn't hide anything from
you... <i>any</i> of you.

435
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,538
Look... Evidence found at my house,

436
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:02,024
me drugged and brought to a hotel...

437
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,826
Is any of that giving you déjà vu?

438
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:06,028
Let's not waste any more time, okay?

439
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:08,931
Just tell us where the bomb is... please.

440
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,400
Think of who could have done this.

441
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:14,526
They are the only person who
can answer that question.

442
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,205
You got to believe me.

443
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,431
- You grew up here?
- Are you kidding?

444
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,979
My mom waited to buy Hogwarts
until<i> after</i> my sister and I left

445
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:26,761
so we would learn humility and values.

446
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:29,474
Where<i> is</i> your mother?
I'd like to thank her for trying.

447
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,386
And I can't wait to see
the look on her face

448
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:33,422
when I finally introduce her
to somebody old enough to vote.

449
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:34,389
[Laughs]

450
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:35,457
Guess I'm getting coats?

451
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:36,992
- I'll get drinks.
- Okay.

452
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:38,594
♪ Don't think I have the energy ♪

453
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,562

00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:43,917
It's, uh, down the hall,

456
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,321
I'll just... I'll show you. Come on.

457
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:46,235
Oh, thank you.

458
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,004
I've been to my fair share of
soirées at the Haas compound.

459
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,595
I've never even been in a house
big enough to get lost in.

460
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:52,608
Are you a politician?

461
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:55,644
Oh, it's<i> really</i> not nice
to insult someone that you've just met.

462
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:57,479
Hannah Wyland... Joint terrorism.

463
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,549
As in my dream job!

464
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:01,483
Alexander Parrish... Mere trainee.

465
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,538
They let you guys out for New Year's?

466
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,153
- Yeah.
- I had a fever of 104,

467
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,788
and they still made me do the steeplechase.

468
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:07,789
My God.

469
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:09,558
If it wasn't an open bar already,

470
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,259
I would totally ask to buy you a drink.

471
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:13,128
And I would say, "yes,
please, and right away,"

472
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:15,481
but I promised my guy that
I'd meet him at the door.

473
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:17,766
He's a good one, but he hates a party.

474
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,201
Usually, I can't feel my hand an hour in

475
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:20,786
from him squeezing it so hard.

476
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,870
Wow.

477
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:23,939
Dream job <i>and</i> dream husband.

478
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:26,591
I thought those two
were mutually exclusive.

479
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:29,029
No. That's just the media
trying to hold us back.

480
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:29,726
[Chuckles] So, I'll see you in there?

481
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:30,678
- Yeah.
- Okay.

482
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:34,549
Hey, Mom.

483
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:36,017
I want to introduce you to...

484
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,418
Shelby Wyatt!

485
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:39,187
Senator Haas, it is an honor.

486
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,182
My husband's told me about you.

487
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:43,224
I didn't realize you guys
were on speaking terms.

488
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,802
Top of your class at Quantico...

489
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:47,493
After rebuilding your
family's business, no less.

490
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,076
Quite a feat. [Chuckles]

491
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:50,814
Your parents would be very proud.

492
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,867
I met them a few times.

493
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:55,102
I am so sorry for what happened.

494
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:58,172
We lost too much that day...
Each and every one of us.

495
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,260
Oh, you were there.

496
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:02,143
I remember the photo in all the papers.

497
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:05,161
You, an agent, walked
right into that second tower

498
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:06,860
when everyone else was
running the other way.

499
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,570
Yeah, that photo got her elected.

500
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,723
- Caleb!
- [Chuckling] What?

501
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:12,352
I'm proud of my mom.

502
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:14,588
My son sees everything I do as political...

503
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:15,922
Even raising him.

504
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,859
But I would have given it
all up if he'd asked me to.

505
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:20,494
Where's your father?

506
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:22,496
I promised I'd introduce him to Ben Carson.

507
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:24,164
God knows why. [Chuckles]

508
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,233
I look forward to speaking
to you again soon.

509
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:27,799
Excuse me.

510
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,932
What's wrong? The great
Claire Haas approved.

511
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:36,404
I basically just got you the Iron Throne.

512
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:38,177
My dad doesn't even live in this house.

513
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:41,714
My parents... they don't talk
to each other on principle.

514
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,950
Something's going on.

515
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:46,719
Every year, Miranda sends
some NAT to talk to me

516
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:48,654
about that damn Vermeer theft.

517
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,723
Usually, they come to my office.

518
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,059
One guy caught me at Trader Joe's.

519
00:18:53,094 --> 00:18:56,062
But you're the first to
accost me at a cocktail party.

520
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:58,664
If you could just walk me
through the details... help me.

521
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:01,367
Sometimes, things just disappear.

522
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:04,370
Like<i> I</i> am... from this conversation.

523
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:07,540
I am gonna go get myself
that Martini I earned.

524
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,143
All right, well, I'll wait over here,
where it's safe.

525
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,512
Caleb.

526
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,080
Or not.

527
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,004
I have been hearing great things
about your training at Quantico.

528
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:20,953
Your mother said I was wrong to doubt you.

529
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:22,698
I'm beginning to believe she's right.

530
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,457
Well, you and Mom agreeing about<i> anything</i>

531
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:26,592
is threat level bravo, so what gives?

532
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,394
Nothing gives. We've...

533
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:31,564
We've just been talking
a lot about you lately.

534
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:33,979
We're talking a<i> lot,</i> actually.

535
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:35,710
What, are you guys getting back together?

536
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:38,306
Well, she<i> has</i> said she wants
to give it another shot.

537
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,945
Thought you'd be happy.

538
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,412
<i>I</i> am.

539
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,848
This holiday is<i> way</i> worse
than Valentine's Day.

540
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:52,150
At least then, if you're single,
you're not a<i> complete</i> failure.

541
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:55,153
But no one to kiss on
New Year's Eve... epic fail.

543
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:57,856
- Stop torturing yourself.
- I can't.

544
00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:59,257
Well, then stop torturing<i> me.</i>

545
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:01,860
- Call him and tell him you made a mistake.
- But if he's with someone else, there's...

546
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:03,507
You just saw him two weeks ago.

547
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:06,408
He didn't meet, fall in love with,
and marry a woman in two weeks.

548
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:09,134

558
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:29,582
Alex?

559
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,974
Look, if I was the bomber,

560
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,493
wouldn't I have gone
through with it already?

561
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:37,061
The convention isn't for hours.

562
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:39,163
The convention?
What does that have to do with this?

563
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:42,114
The fact that it's today?
The dinner downstairs?

564
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:43,768
How did you find me?

565
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:46,328
You were the only one
without a tail last night.

566
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:47,911
Yeah.

567
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:50,153
But how did you know to look?

568
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,188
He'll say anything to get out of this.

569
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,190
We caught you red-handed.

570
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:56,380
You literally have your finger
on a trigger right this second.

571
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,598
I don't know why you would do this,

572
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:01,579
but I know that you would do
anything to save your own skin.

573
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:04,587
Just like when you ran out
of that test at Quantico.

574
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,070
Alex.

575
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:12,276
Are you kidding me right now?

576
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:15,966
It's Simon. It has to be.

577
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,067
No.

578
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:18,568
I have always seen through your lies,

579
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:19,903
but this time, I'm not sure.

580
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:22,329
If you really believe it's me and not him,

581
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:24,174
then why don't I just
let go of this trigger?

582
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:26,149
- Simon, don't!
- Why not?!

583
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:29,579
If I'm the real terrorist,
what am I waiting for?

584
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:30,847
You wouldn't.

585
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:32,115
You got what you wanted...

586
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,517
All that time at Quantico, playing me,

587
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:36,347
setting me up.

588
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:38,255
It wasn't about my sexuality.

589
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,389
You were just trying to get close to me

590
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,324
so you could find out my weaknesses...

591
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,361
Get inside my head so you could frame me.

592
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:46,663
Well, if that was your plan, it worked.

593
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:48,955
I go down as the Grand Central bomber,

594
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,564
and you walk away.

595
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:52,030
You're insane.

596
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:54,893
You ever want to push a button
and make it all go away?

597
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:55,566
Simon.

598
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:58,442
Everyone you ever loved and lost,

599
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,543
everything that ever hurt you...

600
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,012
Just one button.

601
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:04,981
No more fighting.

602
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:06,582
No more regrets.

603
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,402
No more noise.

604
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,753
Blow it all up and see what happens.

605
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:11,463
Simon!

606
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,824
Blow it all up just so you
can get some damn quiet.

607
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,753
- Simon!
- You wanted them to find me.

608
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,156
That's why you brought them
here before this bomb went off.

609
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:20,858
So you better start telling the truth,

610
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:24,671
or it is gonna get real, real quiet.

611
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:27,758
- Three...
- Simon!

612
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,090
- Two...
- Vasquez: My God!

613
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:30,940
- Simon!
- One!

614
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,409
Stop, stop! They'll kill me!

615
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:35,425
They'll kill me.

616
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,531
A week ago,
I got a call from someone.

617
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,391
They disguised their voice.

618
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,598
Whoever it was had proof
that I'd falsified evidence

619
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,824
as a trial attorney in a few capital cases.

620
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,526
They said they'd make sure I went to jail

621
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:52,683
for the rest of my life if
I didn't do what I was told.

622
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:56,064
They knew I'd gone to Quantico
and that I knew you, Alex.

623
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,500
You grabbed me when I
was on my way to work.

624
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:01,637
You drugged me in that van,
took me back to Grand Central,

625
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,071
put me on that rubble...

626
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:05,507
That wasn't me. I was gone by then.

627
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:07,209
I never thought the bomb was real.

628
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:10,412
I thought I was just setting
you up for an attempt.

629
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,989
I swear, I never would
have done it otherwise.

630
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,709
The blood of 133 people
is on your hands, Elias.

631
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:18,504
You think I don't know that?

632
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,322
After the bomb went off,
I knew it was just a matter of time

633
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,658
before I was found out,
and I felt horrible.

634
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,160
Alex calling you to represent her

635
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,828
must have been a dream come true, huh?

636
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,329
All that access we gave you?

637
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,864
You were in the center of it all.

638
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,566
I thought the worst was
over until yesterday,

639
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:32,834
when the terrorist called me again

640
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,802
and said I had one last task.

641
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:37,188
And then I'd be free forever.

642
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:39,240
I was to bring<i> that</i> trigger to this hotel

643
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:40,608
and wait for instructions.

644
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:42,109
I panicked.

645
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:44,312
I-I mean, I didn't want to be
responsible for any more deaths.

646
00:23:44,347 --> 00:23:46,384
So why not come to us?
We could have helped you.

647
00:23:46,463 --> 00:23:47,682
Like the FBI helped<i> you?</i>

648
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,783
They'd arrest me.

649
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,570
Terrorist or not, I am responsible.

650
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:51,852
And I thought of a better way.

651
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,220
Yeah, drugging and framing<i> me?</i>

652
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:55,389
Since you knew the bomber
modeled his stuff off of my work?

653
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:57,525
And given everything
you'd done in your life...

654
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,760
Instead of taking
responsibility for yourself,

655
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:02,696
you decided my life for yours
was a pretty fair trade.

656
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,468
The FBI had enough circumstantial evidence.

657
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,183
I just had to point them in your direction.

658
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:09,650
So I pretended to sleep in my office,

659
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:10,871
slipped my tail.

660
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:12,130
You're despicable.

661
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:13,740
I wanted you to find Simon.

662
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:16,653
I brought you here because I want
you to try and stop this bomb.

663
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:18,712
I had three choices... Come clean,

664
00:24:18,747 --> 00:24:20,814
carry out the second attack myself,

665
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:22,616
or frame Simon and hope to stop it.

666
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:24,818
Look, the only thing
we want to hear from you

667
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:26,386
is where the bomb is.

668
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:27,421
I don't know.

669
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:28,522
The only thing that makes sense

670
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:29,756
is that it's in this building somewhere.

671
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,792
They wanted me here,
and they wanted me dead.

672
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:34,638
Please just don't let go
of that trigger, Simon.

673
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,297
Call Liam now.

674
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:40,333
And then Vice President
Biden is going to...

675
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:42,303
Excuse me, ma'am. We are evacuating.

676
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,842
We have a credible threat,
and we need everyone out right now.

677
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:45,939
How credible?

678
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:47,941
The bomb squad's been
on this hotel for days.

679
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,697
Trust me... This is not a drill. Okay?

680
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:51,966
We're moving everyone to the E.C.C.

681
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,575
Let's go.

[Indistinct conversations]

683
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:01,968
What? Your wife lets you go into
bathrooms with ex-girlfriends?

684
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:03,815
- She is not my wife.
- She's not?

685
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:05,372
She's my<i> ex-wife.</i>

686
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:07,958
W-we're undercover. Okay?

687

You're<i> always</i> undercover.

688
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:11,371
We're still friends.

689
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,519
Look, if you knew the whole story,

690
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:14,033
it wouldn't even be an
issue with you right now.

691
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:15,901
You did not just say that
if I know the whole story...

692
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:17,236
Alex, listen to me.

693
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,772
Everyone at H.Q. knows we
work well as partners, okay?

694
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:22,041
So they assign us to an
op where we're married.

695
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,108
And you<i> told</i> me to leave.

696
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:24,310
I<i> never</i> told you to leave!

697
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:26,527
Well, you sure as hell
didn't ask me to stay.

698
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:28,747
Well, I thought you were in Los Angeles.

699
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:31,250
If I knew you were 30
minutes away, I would have...

700
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,387
You would have what?

701
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:34,887
Then you would have asked me to stay?

702
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:36,555
Alex, you don't know what to do with me

703
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:38,378
when I'm 2 feet away.

704
00:25:38,484 --> 00:25:39,992
[Knocking on door]

705
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:45,498
[Knocking on door]

706
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,074
I...

707
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,894
I can't be here right now.

708
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:52,715
Sorry.

709
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:58,955
You haven't been home
since that night, have you?

710
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:01,412
He can't get to me here.

711
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:04,115
You remind me of my aunt.

712
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,884
After the civil war, she was convinced

713
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,988
that the Lebanese forces
were trying to kill her.

714
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:10,677
Every siren she heard,

715
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,024
every footstep was proof
she was being hunted.

716
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:14,125
Maybe she<i> was.</i>

717
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,460
[Scoffing] Of course not.

718
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:18,879
She just couldn't get out
of this frame of mind.

719
00:26:19,222 --> 00:26:21,834
Just like what happened
to my people after 9/11.

720
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,119
Every Arab man was targeted, questioned,

721
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:26,768
followed, surveilled.

722
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:28,653
They saw us not as humans,

723
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:33,177
but as this hand of a
monster that hated America.

724
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:36,113
I saw people in my community act out

725
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:38,494
in ways they never would have

726
00:26:38,574 --> 00:26:41,098
if they hadn't been treated so unjustly.

727
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,658
Whatever you imagine
people might have done,

728
00:26:43,724 --> 00:26:45,623
just don't lose faith in their humanity,

729
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,246
because when you do,

730
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:49,924
that's when you make the monster.

731
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:53,803
Is it possible you could
be wrong about Charlie?

732
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,135
I know who he is.

733
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,204
And my worst fear is that someday,

734
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,528
everyone else will, too.

735
00:27:03,857 --> 00:27:05,691
Happy New Year, Nimah.

736
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:09,379
Happy New Year.

737
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:11,181
Claire: Please... join me.

738
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:13,650
I just needed a moment to myself.

739
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:17,054
Did you know you wanted to go into politics

740
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:19,122
when you were at the FBI?

741
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:21,758
I like to say that I was
called to public service,

742
00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:23,309
but that's not true.

743
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:25,248
I saw what passed for leadership...

744
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,263
Men telling people to do one thing

745
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,965
while they do the opposite.

746
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,514
Women lead by example.

747
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:32,702
We have to.

748
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:34,804
They shine a brighter light on us.

749
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,806
I know that sounds like a stump speech.

750
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:39,075
Caleb says I'm always
running for something.

751
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,109
But it's true.

752
00:27:40,145 --> 00:27:41,577
[Chuckles]

753
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,580
He's a good son.

754
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:45,664
He'll be a good man, I think.

755
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:48,851
Should I be afraid of him?

756
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,587
I really love him.

757
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:54,691
But your husband told me some things.

758
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:57,727
You shouldn't be afraid of him.

759
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,196
You should be afraid of
what people can do to him.

760
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,762
My son has a...

761
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,951
A good heart.

762
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:07,903
The kind people take advantage of.

763
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:10,806
I've had to distance myself
from some things that he's done,

764
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:12,808
but only because I know
they weren't really him.

765
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:16,462
They were... people using him to get at us.

766
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,314
The cult?

767
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:22,117
It caused a lot of pain for our family.

768
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,470
Clayton and I disagreed
over how to handle it.

769
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:26,628
He wanted to catch the cult red-handed

770
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:30,025
instead of extracting Caleb
before it went that far.

771
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:34,438
He made his choice, and I had to follow.

772
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,182
It cost Caleb's faith in me.

773
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,710
And my faith in my husband.

774
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:42,927
Until now.

775
00:28:43,073 --> 00:28:45,307
Now we're trying again. [Chuckles]

776
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,676
[Clears throat] My goodness.

777
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:49,945
You came out here to
make a good impression,

778
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,814
and I have turned you into my therapist.

779
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:53,882
[Laughing] No.

780
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:56,127
Amanda: Claire? It's time.

781
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,053
Be right there.

782
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,246
Your mother wants pictures of
all of you in front of the tree.

783
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,832
[Laughs] You'd think that
she's running for president.

784
00:29:03,885 --> 00:29:05,204
Oh, another eight years,

785
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,188
but for now, we'll settle for V.P.

786
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:09,096
What... is she on the short list?

787
00:29:09,132 --> 00:29:11,566
Did you think this was just an open house?

788
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:13,401
Does my dad know?

789
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:15,469
Your father is about to become the husband

790
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:17,371
of the most powerful woman in America,

791
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,907
so I think he's gonna be okay.

792
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:23,744
Miranda: All clear.
There are no bombs here.

793
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,012
He needs to give us some more information.

794
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:26,847
We're running out of places to search.

795
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:28,249
I know you know where it is.

796
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:29,517
I don't. I swear.

797
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:30,918
Simon, think.

798
00:29:30,954 --> 00:29:32,253
Where could it be?

799
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,454
I remember when I saw the plans

800
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:34,989
for the train stations in New York,

801
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,824
the tanks that fuel the backup generators

802
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,359
at Grand Central are here.

803
00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:39,460
They're under this building.

804
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:40,825
The dogs have been all
through the building.

805
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:41,796
They found nothing.

806
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:43,497
It must be somewhere
where they can't smell it.

807
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,133
I keep thinking about
that braided copper wire.

808
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,511
Why use that instead of the
blasting wire, like at GCT?

809
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:50,923
Braided copper... It's non-corrosive.

810
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:52,873
It's designed to withstand
extreme temperatures...

811
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:54,442
Fire, heat, cold, water.

812
00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:56,965
The EDC teams wouldn't
be able to detect a bomb

813
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,212
if it was submerged.

814
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:00,359
But we're nowhere near water.

815
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:02,721
Where's the boiler room?

816
00:30:03,024 --> 00:30:05,252
- Can you hold that for a second?
- Open it up now!

817
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:11,825
[Beeping]

818
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,596
Can you defuse it?

819
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:17,698
We found it. And guess
what else is down here.

820
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,696
10,000 gallons of diesel.

821
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:22,402
Which means we're gonna have to clear
a lot more than just this building.

822
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:23,904
Take Elias back to the command center

823
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:25,590
so they can take him into custody.

824
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,008
Hey, hey! Hey!

825
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,577
Go with them, Elias... Please.

826
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:34,148
When they first called me,
I thought I had no choice.

827
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:36,302
But that's not the truth.

828
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:39,153
I was just too scared to make it.

829
00:30:39,188 --> 00:30:40,554
Elias.

830
00:30:41,295 --> 00:30:42,222
Elias.

831
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:44,858
- I'm not scared anymore.
- Elias, don't.

832
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:46,393
Hey! No!

833
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:52,411
How bad is it in there?
Are they singing yet?

834
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:54,490
[Sighs] I wouldn't know. I'm leaving.

835
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:57,056
At least, I<i> would</i> if I could
get a damn Uber to show up.

836
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,691
In D.C. on New Year's Eve?

837
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:00,286
You're better off going inside

838
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:02,904
and debating the merits
of trump with Claire Haas.

839
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:04,603
[Sighs] Ryan's in there.

840
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,034
I thought he was in L.A.

841
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:13,171
Yeah, well, apparently,
L.A. is a lot closer than we thought.

842
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:15,640
I know you don't like what he did,

843
00:31:15,676 --> 00:31:18,877
but if you're gonna hate anyone, hate<i> me.</i>

844
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,746
It's my fault. I made him lie to you.

845
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:22,447
That's not who he is.

846
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:25,966
That man in there takes bullets

847
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:27,918
for the people he cares about.

848
00:31:27,981 --> 00:31:29,934
I should know... He's taken several for me.

849
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:31,990
And he'd take them for you,
too, if it ever comes to that.

850
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:34,726
Look, I know what you're saying is right.

851
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:36,527
I just...

852
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:38,229
I just can't trust him anymore.

853
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:40,064
You're in the FBI, Alex.

854
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,767
You'll never trust anyone again.

855
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:45,236
But you<i> can</i> stop believing
that every dishonest thing

856
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:47,752
that someone does is their true self.

857
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:49,774
Some people are simply good.

858
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,302
Caleb: Ask her, Dad.

859
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:55,680
- Claire...
- What are you doing?

860
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:57,448
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's gotten into him.

861
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:59,012
What are those notes for?

862
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:01,786
I'm giving a toast for
our family at midnight.

863
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:04,405
It's so nice that we're all here together.

864
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:07,054
Why don't you tell him
about the short list?

865
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:09,259
Go on... tell him.

866
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:13,330
Shelby, why don't you and Caleb...

867
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,631
Yeah, why don't we give them a moment?

868
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,133
What? Do you... Do you work for her now?

869
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,821
No, no, I-I think that my
dad deserves to know,

870
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,705
after years of trying to get
back together with my mom,

871
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,475
that the only reason that she said yes

872
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,469
is because she's approved
for the short list for V.P.

873
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:30,550
And the DNC loves a candidate
with strong family values,

874
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:33,115
and the great Claire Haas hates losing.

875
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,346
Is that true, Claire?

876
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:44,885
The nomination is...
is completely unrelated to us.

877
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,096
[Knock on door]

878
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:47,797

Look, I told you... they
brainwashed me. All right?

1060
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,374
They made me believe

1061
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,343
that the government was
taking away our liberties.

1062
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:03,545
But I... I was 17!

you would show people the truth?

For so long, I've been trying to realize

why I've never told you that I love you.

Because I do.

Caleb, I love you so much.

regardless of whether it's right to,

1075
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:29,310

just to get people to see your truth,
