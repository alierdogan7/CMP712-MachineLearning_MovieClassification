1
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:22,153
I can't do it.
I can't testify.

2
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,189
Mr. Campbell, the attorney
general has put together

3
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:27,258
a grand jury based primarily
on your testimony.

4
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:28,726
You don't
take the stand,

5
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:30,461
we can't indict Joey Salucci.

6
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:31,996
We can't try him for murder.

7
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:34,165
Unfortunately for us,

8
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:35,600
the evidence
is circumstantial.

9
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,436
But with your witness account,
this case is a slam dunk.

10
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:41,005
Exactly, the most renown
gangster in Miami,

11
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,374
and I could be responsible
for putting him away.

12
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,508
That's a death sentence.

13
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,110
No, that is why the city

14
00:00:46,177 --> 00:00:47,245
has arranged
for this safe house.

15
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:48,813
Eric and I are
personally

16
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,648
escorting you
into circuit court today.

17
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:54,585
I'm just so tired
of looking over my shoulder.

18
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:56,287
That's over
after the hearing.

19
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:57,722
That's why we have you
and your family

20
00:00:57,788 --> 00:00:59,457
set up to go right
into witness protection.

21
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:05,796
Mr. Campbell,
this is incredibly difficult.

22
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:07,665
And I am very sorry.

23
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:10,668
But keep in mind that
A.J. Watkins lost his life,

24
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:13,070
and so will many other people
as long as Joey Salucci

25
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:14,672
is allowed to be a free man.

26
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:18,409
I know. You're right.

27
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:21,779
You're right.
You're right.

28
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:24,982
You mind running through
my testimony with me?

29
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,051
Of course.

30
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,821
Okay, let's start
at the beginning.

31
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:32,290
You were at a club?

32
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:34,225
Yes. Spiral Bar.

33
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,193
Had to entertain
a couple of clients.

34
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,695
Did you have anything to drink?

35
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:41,432
Just a half dozen soda waters,
disguised as gin and tonics.

36
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:43,501
Keeps the mind on business.

37
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,603
We were there till last call.

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,006
I said my "good nights"
and hit the restroom.

39
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:51,909
And that's when I saw
A.J.. Watkins.

40
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:54,178
(club music playing)

41
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,913
Hey.

42
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,882
What's up, man?

43
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,354
I went into the second stall.

44
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,323
I wasn't there
but for a few seconds,

45
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:06,891
and it happened.

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,828
(banging and scuffling)

47
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:12,330
MAN: Hey, man.
(cocks gun)

48
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:14,832
Joey Salucci.
Know the name?

49
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:16,133
This is for Emma.

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,402
(gunshot)

51
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,237
And you distinctly

52
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:22,173
heard the name "Joey Salucci."

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,475
Yes. No doubt in my mind.

54
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,611
Right then, I knew
what I was up against.

55
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:29,680
(gunshot)

56
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,819
(footfalls)

57
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:53,738
What'd you do?

58
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:55,473
Thought I was a goner.

59
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,775
So I called 911.

60
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:58,943
(gun cocks)

61
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:00,344
Figured if anything,

62
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:02,513
someone would figure out
what happened to me.

63
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:09,120
OPERATOR:
911, what's your emergency?

64
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:11,889
(whispering):
This is William Campbell.

65
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:15,693
There's been a murder
at Spiral Bar on Washington.

66
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:19,697
Hurry. I need help.

67
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:26,404
I went out when the coast
was clear.

68
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,441
And the guy's body,
it was... gone.

69
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:32,910
It's very difficult

70
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:34,412
to prove murder
without a body.

71
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:37,081
That's why what you're
about to say is so crucial.

72
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:38,949
DELKO:
All right, guys,

73
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:40,151
we've got to get going.

74
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:41,652
I'm going to radio ahead
to the uniforms

75
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,087
at the elevator
and the rear entrance,

76
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:44,422
tell them to prepare
for transit.

77
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:45,489
All right?

78
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:58,702
Get down!

79
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,704
(glass breaking)

80
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:11,348
Eric?!

81
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:12,716
I'm stuck!

82
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:14,185
I can't get to you!

83
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,387
William?!

84
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:18,456
(panting, floor creaking)

85
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:21,959
(crumbling)

86
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:23,793
William!
Calleigh!

87
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,796
William!

88
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:27,164
Grab my hand!

89
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,366
Grab it.

90
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,738
Look in my eyes.
Stay with me! Stay with me!

91
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:41,979
Stay with me.

92
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:43,414
My family.

93
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:52,890
(body thuds)

94
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:03,834
(crying)

95
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:27,558
Yeah!

96
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:32,062

CBS

98
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:50,247
We don't get fooled again

99
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:54,451
Don't get fooled again

100
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:55,753
No, no!

101
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:22,345
No one's being
allowed up

102
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:24,247
until the building
damage can be surveyed.

103
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,883
The fire department says the
structure's still unsound.

104
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,085
The cause of death
is obvious, but, uh,

105
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:31,387
I'll document the scene
for the case files.

106
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:34,557
You okay, Eric?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,626
Calleigh?

108
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,330
Calleigh is, uh...

109
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:41,798
She's okay.
She gave her statement,

110
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:44,200
and she just ran
off to track down
the crane operator.

111
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,435
Did we find anything?

112
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:46,669
Not yet.

113
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:48,738
Whoever did this
is long gone.

114
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:53,743
His name is
Joseph Salucci, Eric.

115
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,813
Campbell could've closed
the books on him for good.

116
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,348
It's not unlike him

117
00:06:58,414 --> 00:07:00,016
to do anything to stay
out of prison.

118
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,551
No, it's not,
and he just used

119
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:04,654
the biggest murder weapon
in Miami.

120
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:32,916
You did everything you
could to save him, Calleigh.

121
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:35,185
MAN:
Officer Duquesne?

122
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,920
They said you
were looking for me.

123
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:38,721
Yeah, you the
project manager?

124
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:39,889
Yeah, Travis Blake.

125
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,858
Uh, how can I help you?

126
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:43,927
You can start by telling us
who operated the crane today.

127
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:46,329
Well, your guess is
as good as mine.

128
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:48,031
I know that that crane
has been idle,

129
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:49,899
because I pulled the plug

130
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,935
on this construction site
a week ago.

131
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,404
DELKO: Yeah,
why's that?

132
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,673
Well, housing market's
in the toilet,

133
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,474
bank's pulled
both of my loans.

134
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,045
That basically turned this
building into a ghost town.

135
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:03,713
DELKO:
The safe house
was done.

136
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,114
And it was
fully furnished.

137
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:06,749
Yeah, well,
that's the model.

138
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,384
It was supposed
to help us make sales.

139
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,486
I didn't sell
a single unit.

140
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:12,622
After this is done,
I doubt if I ever will.

141
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:13,857
You know a Joey Salucci?

142
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:15,358
Who?

143
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:17,126
The hard hat do a number
on your memory?

144
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:18,895
Joey Salucci, he's
in the construction business.

145
00:08:18,962 --> 00:08:20,330
Or at least
that's his cover.

146
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,767
Joey... Joey Salucci. Yeah.

147
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:28,071
Yeah, it rings a bell. Yeah.

148
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:29,339
Yeah, I know him, why?

149
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,908
We're finding it
an odd coincidence that you

150
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,177
volunteered your place
as a safe house for our victim.

151
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:35,912
DUQUESNE: Maybe you
ran the crane today.

152
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,781
Do Salucci a favor,
take some of the financial

153
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:40,650
pressure off of you;
is that how it works?

154
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:44,454
That's a hell of a scenario
that you just laid out.

155
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:49,192
You got any evidence
to back it up?

156
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:50,793
Working on it.

157
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,962
Don't go far.

158
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,552
CAINE:
How are you, Joseph?

159
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:20,523
I see you're out of jail.

160
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,295
Show some respect, huh?

161
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,230
I'm visiting my daughter.

162
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:30,099
You know, you locked
me up for two years.

163
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,101
I could've spent
a lot of time with her

164
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,469
in those two years.

165
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,772
I come here every morning.

166
00:09:37,774 --> 00:09:40,443
But it'll never be enough.

167
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,345
Never.

168
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,716
Nobody should ever
lose a child, Joseph.

169
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:49,619
Two weeks ago,
she goes to some

170
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:52,088
bonfire on the beach,

171
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:54,891
falls asleep.

172
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,960
She was left there all alone.

173
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,330
(fire crackling)

174
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,268
(ATV motors humming)

175
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:08,137
Come on, hurry up!

176
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:09,339
South Pointe's
the best place

177
00:10:09,405 --> 00:10:11,140
to see the sunrise.

178
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:17,914
(grunts)

179
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:20,683
Oh, my God!

180
00:10:23,886 --> 00:10:27,323
They say she didn't
feel any pain.

181
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,025
It was an accident.

182
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:30,259
Difference of opinion.

183
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:32,095
And it seems
that you've taken

184
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:34,430
your revenge at the Spiral Bar.

185
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:36,332
Never been there.

186
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,434
I had a witness
that can

187
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,503
tie you to the murder, Joseph.

188
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,838
Is that so?

189
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:43,439
Yeah.

190
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:46,342
I say "had," because
he's been killed, too.

191
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,178
It's news to me.

192
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:51,180
But what the hell, huh?

193
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:53,349
We all gotta go sometime.

194
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,251
Some sooner than others.

195
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,159
Oh, God.

196
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:06,529
(panic breathing)

197
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:08,664
Don't look down.

198
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:12,035
DUQUESNE:
Hey, Ryan,
how you doing up there?

199
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,870
You're about 200 feet.

200
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:16,672
I'm doing great.

201
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,074
In fact, cue the wind.

202
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:19,642
(panting)

203
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,477
I feel like a Ringling Brother.

204
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,746
The contractor's playing
Mr. Innocent, saying

205
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,081
nobody was up there all day.

206
00:11:25,148 --> 00:11:26,916
See if you see anything
to the contrary.

207
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,256
No.

208
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:34,824
Cab's pretty clean.
System's offline.

209
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,893
There's a computer on board.

210
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,461
I'm guessing has
an internal monitoring system.

211
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:40,530
You mean like some sort
of a black box?

212
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:43,232
Yeah. It records every movement
and action of the crane.

213
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,901
He never said anything
about that.

214
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:46,235
(laughs)

215
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:47,570
It's probably for good reason.

216
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:50,273
You know what? I think
I can jack into this,

217
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,142
and, uh, bring the information
back to the A.V. lab.

218
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:54,544
(thudding)
Whoa! Whoa!

219
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,112
What the hell is that?!

220
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:57,313
(metallic creaking)

221
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,514
What was what?
(gasping)

222
00:11:58,581 --> 00:11:59,782
(creaking)

223
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,150
No, I said...

224
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:03,519
I was saying... I was saying,
"Look at that."

225
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,021
It's quite a view.

226
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:06,522
I mention

227
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,591
what a good time I was having?

228
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:14,497
Calleigh?

229
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:18,501
I think we got
some blood up here.

230
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:23,372
Hi.
- Hi.

231
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,975
So, how we doing
with that blood
from the crane?

232
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,810
Nice get, by the way.

233
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,378
That sample was pristine.

234
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:30,580
Thanks.

235
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:32,482
Made it very easy
to pull up a profile.

236
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:34,484
(beeping)
Think it's ironic
that after

237
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,552
all that destruction,
this whole case could come down

238
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:37,720
to one drop of blood.

239
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:38,988
Yeah.

240
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:40,189
(three beeps)

241
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:41,491
Check this out.

242
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:45,928
Now, there's a face only
a mug shot could love.

243
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:48,164
Kurt Greenfield.

244
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:55,338
Mr. Greenfield,
how do you know Joseph Salucci?

245
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:57,740
Who? Bell's not ringing.

246
00:12:57,807 --> 00:12:59,442
Maybe it'd help if we talked
a little bit slower.

247
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,943
Man was killed

248
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,745
by a runaway crane.

249
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:04,180
You're the crane operator.

250
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:05,348
CAINE:
We found your blood

251
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:06,949
in the cab.

252
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:08,184
TRIPP:
Salucci put you up

253
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:09,118
to murder, didn't he?

254
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:10,586
Whoa, whoa.

255
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,889
This about that thing
that happened downtown?

256
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:14,524
You're way ahead of me here.

257
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,159
Well, then try
and catch up.

258
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:17,660
Employment records say
at one time,

259
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:18,761
you worked for Salucci.

260
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:20,897
Back in the day, yeah,

261
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:23,299
but I got out of that racket.

262
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:25,902
Even look the wrong way
with a guy like that,

263
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:27,603
suddenly
you're taking a dirt nap.

264
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,106
Don't tell him I said that.

265
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:32,542
Now we've got evidence
of you at our crime scene.

266
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:33,776
You're looking at

267
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:35,011
a permanent
vacation, sport.

268
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:37,046
At the Gray Bar Motel.

269
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:40,049
All right, look it.

270
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:43,819
I did some work there
under the table.

271
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:47,356
But I got canned last week
when the site shut down.

272
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:49,392
So you opted
for a little payback.

273
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,027
No, it wasn't like that.

274
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:53,262
Ax came down so quick last week,

275
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:55,565
I didn't have time
to grab my stuff.

276
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:58,334
And I needed...

277
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:02,638
I needed my pills.

278
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,473
Your pills?

279
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,209
Uppers, man.

280
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:07,677
My cross tops.

281
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:10,012
Used to pop 'em on the job.

282
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,683
Only thing that keeps the lids
open on a ten-hour stretch.

283
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,222
Oh, look,

284
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:22,058
I wasn't in the cage
when Armageddon hit, man.

285
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:23,726
You got to believe me.

286
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:27,128
Mr. Greenfield,
I don't have to do anything.

287
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,903
(distant siren blaring)

288
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:39,575
You're the officers
who were with William?

289
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,714
Yes, ma'am. We want
to thank you both

290
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:47,250
for coming down
and talking to us.

291
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:50,486
Yeah. We wanted to tell you
face-to-face how sorry we are.

292
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:54,190
And just explain to you
what happened.

293
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:56,058
I know exactly
what happened.

294
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,728
The state attorney
filled me in.

295
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:01,430
The only reason we
came down here is so
you could look us

296
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:05,234
both in the face,
and tell us why.

297
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:09,171
Dad said you'd
protect us

298
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,506
from Salucci.

299
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:13,709
(stammering):
That-that you... that you...

300
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:17,647
DELKO:
Listen, we were thorough.

301
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:19,849
We did our best.

302
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:22,652
I mean, we really felt we had
all of our bases were covered.

303
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:24,754
Even though you knew
that that wasn't possible

304
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,023
with a guy like Salucci.

305
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,493
And now my husband is dead,

306
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,063
and I can only assume
that we're next.

307
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,965
The two of you are not
a threat to him.

308
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:38,301
And the offer
for witness

309
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:39,435
protection still stands.

310
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:41,170
Do you have any idea

311
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:44,006
what this case has
done to our lives?

312
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:47,410
And for what?

313
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:50,079
I supported Will's
decision to testify,

314
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:53,516
as much as every fiber of
my being told me otherwise.

315
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:54,850
Do you want to know why?

316
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,686
Because it was
the right thing to do.

317
00:15:58,154 --> 00:15:59,822
William was an incredibly
brave man, and...

318
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:01,757
You do not get

319
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:05,161
to talk about him,
Ms. Duquesne.

320
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:08,397
(crying):
You don't.

321
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:10,466
Not today.

322
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:18,974
Listen, we're going
to find whoever did this, okay?

323
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,643
Just trust us.

324
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,580
I trusted you
once already.

325
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,683
I won't make the
same mistake twice.

326
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,288
Mom,
come on.

327
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:34,357
Let's go home.

328
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,837
You okay?

329
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:49,905
(sighs)

330
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:55,478
DUQUESNE:
No.

331
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:56,946
No, I'm not.

332
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:00,383
There's something
that we're missing.

333
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:02,651
I'm gonna go back there.

334
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,601
Hey. Is that
the A.V. Hummer?

335
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,669
Yeah.

336
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:24,038
You know, I heard what happened
with the wife today.

337
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:25,273
Are you okay?

338
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,874
Well, I guess
if you heard what happened,

339
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:29,110
then you know I probably
don't want to talk about it.

340
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:31,546
Fair enough.

341
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:33,481
Okay. So, uh...

342
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:35,116
So, what are we looking for?

343
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:37,051
Tire treads. Somehow
our killer was able

344
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:39,520
to find the location
of the cafe house.

345
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:42,223
The site's been shut
down for a week,

346
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,192
so now other cars
should have been here.

347
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:45,360
Treads are fresh.

348
00:17:45,426 --> 00:17:47,061
Yeah, and they ran
over the debris.

349
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:48,229
So, someone drove here

350
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,665
after the crane crashed
into the building.

351
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,771
And from the looks of it,
they didn't get away scot-free.

352
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:58,606
(camera shutter clicking)

353
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,779
This glass has charcoal-gray
paint transfer on it.

354
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,282
Hundred bucks says
this is auto paint.

355
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:12,286
(glass shattering,
debris clattering)

356
00:18:13,821 --> 00:18:15,923
I'll get started
casting the treads.

357
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,291
Actually, there's a quicker way.

358
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:19,327
The new software allows us
to photograph the treads,

359
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:21,663
and then send the 3-D image back
to the lab,

360
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:22,997
or in this case,

361
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:25,433
the A.V. Hummer, wirelessly.

362
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,569
(computers chirping)

363
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:35,301
Width: nine inches.

364
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:37,470
Tread depth:
five-sixteenths of an inch.

365
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:39,572
Wheel base-- 112 inches.

366
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:41,374
I'll download the specs

367
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:43,509
to the North American Vehicle
Manufacturing Database.

368
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:45,612
Combine it
with charcoal paint trace.

369
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:49,682
WOLFE:
Gives us a BMW
645ci convertible.

370
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,851
Now, how many of that model

371
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:54,120
and color are registered
in the city?

372
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:55,355
Let's see.

373
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:58,791
That's
a long list.

374
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:01,194
There's only one that's a know
associate of Joey Salucci.

375
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:03,196
Mick Ragosa.

376
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:05,031
Okay. I'll put out a BOLO.

377
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:11,537
PILOT:
Air 20. Suspect vehicle sighted.

378
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,139
Adams and Fifth.

379
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:14,774
Repeat. Adams and Fifth.

380
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:16,509
(helicopter blades whirring)

381
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:20,546
(car engine idling, garbled
police radio transmission)

382
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:25,485
Hey, shut that off!

383
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:26,653
You Mick
Ragosa?
Yup.

384
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,221
Step out of the
car, please.

385
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:30,690
(car door closes)

386
00:19:30,757 --> 00:19:32,692
CAINE:
There's quite a bit

387
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,928
of damage on your car,
Mr. Ragosa.

388
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:36,696
(sighing):
It sucks.

389
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:38,531
Happened to be driving
through downtown

390
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:40,366
when that crane
hit the high-rise.

391
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:42,936
Joseph Salucci.

392
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:44,270
What about him?

393
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:45,972
We play poker time to time.

394
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,307
That's it.

395
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:48,875
TRIPP:
Then I'm calling your bluff.

396
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:51,277
No way you just happened
to be at our crime scene.

397
00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:54,080
Might be time to
pay a visit to Joey.

398
00:19:54,147 --> 00:19:55,615
Tell him some lies about you.

399
00:19:55,682 --> 00:19:56,582
You wouldn't.

400
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:57,984
Try me. It's only Monday,

401
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:00,787
and I've already had one hell
of a bad week.

402
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:04,791
Fine.

403
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:07,760
With his daughter gone and all,

404
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:10,430
the last thing that Joey needs
is another legal headache.

405
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:12,765
We got word
about the safe house,

406
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:14,801
so I followed that Campbell guy
down there.

407
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,136
Thought maybe
I could get him to back off.

408
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:18,404
Refuse to testify.

409
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:19,872
Suddenly,

410
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,941
it started raining glass.

411
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:28,114
(loud rumbling and thudding)

412
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:31,918
(tires screeching)

413
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:34,420
I barely got out of there
with my life.

414
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:38,925
Did you happen to see
who was operating the crane?

415
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:40,994
Nope.

416
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,796
And Salucci never
even knew I was there.

417
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,098
Guys been through enough
already.

418
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:46,666
Can't you just leave him alone?

419
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:49,502
Mr. Salucci needs
to go back to jail,

420
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,537
and I'm gonna send him there.

421
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:56,943
Is that the data
from the box

422
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,778
that Ryan found
in the crane cab?

423
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:01,481
Yup. There's a reason they
call this a tattletale system.

424
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:03,916
There isn't much it doesn't
know about the crash.

425
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:05,151
Like what?

426
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:06,619
For instance,

427
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:09,655
angle of the crane arm
at impact-- 72 degrees.

428
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:11,491
Miles per hour-- 11.

429
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:14,093
Time of impact--
8:22 a.m.

430
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,229
It's too bad
the tattletale can't tell us

431
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,497
who the crane operator was.

432
00:21:17,563 --> 00:21:19,132
Well, it can,
in a way.

433
00:21:19,198 --> 00:21:20,333
There are two manual joysticks

434
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,801
in the cab
controlling the crane.

435
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:23,803
Each reports data
back to the CPU.

436
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,006
But watch the
replay of the crash.

437
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:28,641
See that graph
over there?

438
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,209
(computer chirps)

439
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:31,944
Yeah. Nothing's happening.

440
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:33,880
Exactly. Meaning

441
00:21:33,946 --> 00:21:36,482
that those controls weren't eve
being used during the crash.

442
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:39,552
So, the crane was being
remotely operated.

443
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:41,621
Yup. The killer
was never even

444
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:43,689
in that cab.
That just means

445
00:21:43,756 --> 00:21:45,358
that it could have been operated
from anywhere.

446
00:21:45,425 --> 00:21:46,659
Au contraire.

447
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:48,928
The remote operating system
only has a range radius

448
00:21:48,995 --> 00:21:50,129
of 500 feet.

449
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:51,964
Let's check out the surrounding area.

450
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:53,966
Okay.

451
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,368
(computer chirping)

452
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:57,470
Remote would have to
be within this area.

453
00:21:57,537 --> 00:22:00,540
And the killer would have had
to have known that Campbell was

454
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:01,941
in the safe house
in order to make sure

455
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:03,276
that the crane took him out.

456
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:06,079
And you can't get that eye line
from ground level.

457
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,447
Exactly-- he would have had
to go higher up,

458
00:22:07,513 --> 00:22:08,514
so he would have had to been

459
00:22:08,581 --> 00:22:10,049
on a neighboring rooftop
or something.

460
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:11,184
Let's take a look
and see

461
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,418
how many rooftops have
that line of sight

462
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:13,953
within the radius.

463
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:22,829
Well, there's none...

464
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:25,465
but there is a
parking structure

465
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:27,633
just down the street.

466
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,701
Perfect.

467
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:30,069
DELKO:
Here we go.

468
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:31,471
It's just like Natalia said.

469
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:33,773
It's a perfect vantage point
into the safe house.

470
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,741
So the killer stole
the remote off the crane

471
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:38,978
and then waited out here until
they knew Campbell was inside?

472
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,847
Yeah, and never put it back
after using it,

473
00:22:40,913 --> 00:22:42,248
which explains
why we never found it

474
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:43,716
at the construction site.

475
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:45,918
So there might be a good
chance they still have it?

476
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:47,120
You ever see
one of these things?

477
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:48,454
They're pretty big.

478
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:50,423
It's not the kind of thing
you tuck under your shirt.

479
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,625
So maybe it'd be smart
to leave it behind?

480
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:57,196
Yeah.

481
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:08,941
Yeah, but dumb to get caught.

482
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,635
Maxine, Eric said
that you had the neck strap

483
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:36,969
from the crane remote?

484
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:38,571
Yeah, the remote didn't
have any prints on it.

485
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,706
He thought I might have
more luck with the strap.

486
00:23:40,773 --> 00:23:42,008
Did you?
We'll see.

487
00:23:42,074 --> 00:23:43,242
Cross your
fingers

488
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:45,778
and hope some skin cells
sloughed off our killer

489
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:47,246
while doing the deed.

490
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:53,319
(beeping)

491
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:54,954
Okay, there must be
some sort of mistake.

492
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:57,823
There's no match in CODIS,
and I thought for sure that...

493
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,025
Joey Salucci

494
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,960
and Mick Ragosa are
both in the system.

495
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:02,795
Means they didn't do it.

496
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,897
Okay, will you run this

497
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:07,233
against the elimination samples
from the case, please?

498
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,834
Sure, no problem.
(typing)

499
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:13,873
96% probability match

500
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,541
to William Campbell.

501
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:17,009
That's not right.

502
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:18,010
That's our victim.

503
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:19,212
It's right, unfortunately.

504
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:20,813
This is a familial match.

505
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,915
XY, male.

506
00:24:22,982 --> 00:24:24,784
His son.

507
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:31,824
How could you do it?

508
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:33,960
Do what?

509
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:35,494
I-I'm not sure what you mean.

510
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,063
Don't.

511
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:40,433
Just don't.

512
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:42,401
You killed your father.

513
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:47,473
No.

514
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:52,979
No, I...

515
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,048
What did you do, Noah?

516
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:57,450
What did you do?

517
00:24:58,484 --> 00:25:01,420
I didn't mean to, I swear.

518
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:05,725
Don't say anything else.

519
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:06,726
You need an
attorney.

520
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:07,760
I'm gonna get you an attorney.

521
00:25:07,827 --> 00:25:10,296
No, Mom.

522
00:25:10,363 --> 00:25:13,466
Dad risked everything
just to tell the truth.

523
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:18,004
Now I have to.

524
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:26,712
When he decided
to testify...

525
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,316
...he made that
decision all by himself.

526
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:32,084
No, that's not true.

527
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:33,419
He discussed it with me,

528
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:35,655
and we decided that
that's what he had to do.

529
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,256
But he never asked me.

530
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:42,061
The Witness
Protection Program?

531
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:43,729
I have a life here.

532
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:44,997
School, friends.

533
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:48,434
But your life is with us.

534
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:50,136
We're your family.

535
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:51,804
It doesn't matter where we live.

536
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:55,408
But it's not fair.

537
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:57,510
All this talk about
"doing the right thing."

538
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:59,679
The right thing for who?

539
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:04,383
How did you do it?

540
00:26:06,852 --> 00:26:08,688
How did you operate the crane?

541
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:16,829
Everything's... on the Internet.

542
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,898
So I...

543
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:23,936
...swiped the remote.

544
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:25,171
O-Only thing it doesn't tell you

545
00:26:25,237 --> 00:26:28,140
is what to do
when things go wrong.

546
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,246
(crane whirring)

547
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:43,622
Come on.

548
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,291
(rumbling crash)

549
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:47,126
(glass shattering)

550
00:26:48,861 --> 00:26:52,498
(screams echoing)

551
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:55,701
It was out of control.

552
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:57,436
I couldn't stop it.

553
00:26:57,503 --> 00:26:59,505
I only wanted to scare Dad.

554
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,143
So he wouldn't
testify.

555
00:27:06,178 --> 00:27:08,814
So, so...

556
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:11,851
so things could be
the way they were.

557
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:30,536
You wanted a life, Noah?

558
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:36,409
You just took away all of ours.

559
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:44,750
I'm sorry, Ms. Duquesne.

560
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,222
SALUCCI:
What a beautiful day.

561
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:52,525
Huh?

562
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:56,028
Come on, have a
victory drink with me.

563
00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:59,865
I wouldn't be too quick
to celebrate, Joseph.

564
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:04,336
My lawyers tell me
that Campbell's kid killed him.

565
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:06,605
Tragic.

566
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:07,907
Very tragic.

567
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:10,876
Very Shakespearean.

568
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:13,279
Maybe you can back off now
and leave me alone.

569
00:28:13,344 --> 00:28:16,782
In due time, Joseph,
in due time.

570
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:19,685
You proved it yourself
I didn't kill the weasel.

571
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:21,454
Case closed.

572
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,922
A.J. Watkins.

573
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:27,726
The guy who killed
my daughter?

574
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:31,030
Didn't he, uh...

575
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:32,831
disappear a few weeks ago?

576
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:39,371
No body, no crime.

577
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:42,842
Not yet... Joseph.

578
00:28:57,807 --> 00:28:59,742
(elevator bell dings)

579
00:29:01,577 --> 00:29:02,745
H., I got your phone call.

580
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:04,914
What's up?
- A.J. Watkins.

581
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:06,783
Unfortunately,
still at square one.

582
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,584
Without Campbell's testimony,
the grand jury won't convene.

583
00:29:08,651 --> 00:29:11,654
So what exactly
did Mr. Campbell witness?

584
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:13,523
Well, he was
in the bathroom.

585
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,491
He heard someone
threatening A.J.

586
00:29:17,593 --> 00:29:20,430
MAN:
Hey, man. Joey Salucci.
Know the name?

587
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:21,597
(gun cocks)

588
00:29:21,664 --> 00:29:24,000
This is for Emma.
(gunshot)

589
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:26,836
Then he heard a shot go off
and called 911.

590
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:35,044
OPERATOR:
911, what's your emergency?

591
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:37,714
So we need the 911 recording.

592
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,382
That's right.

593
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:41,217
While he was
on the phone with 911,

594
00:29:41,284 --> 00:29:42,919
911 was listening to the room.

595
00:29:44,253 --> 00:29:46,322
I just got the 911
tape from Eric.

596
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:48,891
Are we looking for
something specific?

597
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:50,159
We're looking
for something

598
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:52,128
that wasn't
in William's testimony.

599
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:53,629
A unique gun noise,

600
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:55,164
the killer's voice,
anything.

601
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:58,167
OPERATOR:
911, what's your emergency?

602
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:00,303
CAMPBELL (whispers):
This is William Campbell.

603
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,906
There's been a murder
at Spiral Bar on Washington.

604
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:07,076
Hurry. I need help.

605
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:09,412
Sir? Sir, are you hurt?

606
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,514
Mr. Campbell, are you there?

607
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:13,149
(water trickling)
What was that?

608
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:15,385
Part of the music, maybe?

609
00:30:16,886 --> 00:30:19,055
I don't know.
Can you isolate that noise?

610
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:22,225
(water trickling)

611
00:30:24,227 --> 00:30:26,529
Sounds like
a toilet flushing.

612
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:28,097
William wouldn't do that.

613
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,999
He wouldn't want to call
attention to himself.

614
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:32,468
That audio perspective
is from the next stall.

615
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:35,638
So the killer shoots
and then takes a bathroom break?

616
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:37,340
No.

617
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:39,542
Wait. The shooter was

618
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,144
cleaning the scene.

619
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,879
He was flushing evidence.

620
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:45,348
We've got to get
back to the bathroom.

621
00:30:55,258 --> 00:30:57,193
Wow.

622
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,228
A.J. Watkins disappeared
almost two weeks ago,

623
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:01,297
and this place looks
just like night shift left it.

624
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:02,632
Yeah, well, this club

625
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:04,567
got a lot of unwanted publicity
after the shooting.

626
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:08,004
So, uh...
they closed their doors.

627
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,573
Bad for them, good for us.

628
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,909
Evidence might still be intact.

629
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:14,243
Now that is the second stall.

630
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,945
So that's where William
was hiding.

631
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,714
So this is
probably where

632
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:20,283
the shooter
disposes something.

633
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:29,258
Looks like they already
printed the toilet.

634
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:31,327
Yeah.

635
00:31:31,394 --> 00:31:33,830
Well, that means we're going
to have to go to plan B.

636
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:38,601
It also means... we're going
to need thicker gloves.

637
00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:40,670
(sighs)

638
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:45,675
WOLFE:
There is a chance that whatever
was flushed down here

639
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:48,911
hasn't made it into th
e city's sewer system yet.

640
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,182
Okay, that's it. I'm out of line.

641
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:54,817
What the hell?

642
00:31:54,884 --> 00:31:57,120
People flush
the weirdest things.

643
00:31:57,186 --> 00:32:00,323
Including what might be
a nine millimeter shell casing.

644
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:02,225
Hmm.

645
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:07,763
Have you had lunch yet?

646
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:14,303
All right, you
ready for this?

647
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,706
Yes, yes, just... do it.

648
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,042
(sewage pouring,
Boa Vista groans)

649
00:32:38,594 --> 00:32:41,464
H., I heard you were
working on the casing.

650
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:42,698
I thought
that the, uh,

651
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:44,534
water and the sewage
did a number on this thing.

652
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,902
Ryan couldn't pull
a print from it.

653
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:48,070
Doesn't mean it's not
there though, does it, Eric?

654
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:51,374
What's this?
This...

655
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,676
is a new acquisition.

656
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:55,111
I think I've heard of this.

657
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:57,613
This is the technique where
you can detect corrosion, right?

658
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,714
That's correct.

659
00:32:58,781 --> 00:33:01,284
It occurs...

660
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,386
when human sweat...

661
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:06,355
touches metal.

662
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:09,058
If you touch a casing
before it's fired,

663
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,160
your print literally
burns onto it.

664
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:17,700
Problem is, this level
of corrosion's

665
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,435
impossible for the human eye
to see.

666
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:20,469
So,

667
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:21,871
in order to make it visible,

668
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:23,873
we run a charge
through the casing,

669
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,942
add the conductive powder,
and....

670
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:43,159
There's your print.

671
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:49,065
You guys can't seem
to get enough of me today.

672
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:50,666
Mr. Ragosa,

673
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,568
in the world
of criminal prosecution,

674
00:33:52,635 --> 00:33:55,004
that's not always a good thing.

675
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:56,806
DELKO:
We found a casing.

676
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,642
It matches the bullet
you used

677
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:00,810
to shot A.J. Watkins.

678
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:02,912
CAINE:
It turns out that

679
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:05,982
William Campbell wasn't the
only witness to the murder.

680
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:10,419
DELKO:
911 was there, too.

681
00:34:10,486 --> 00:34:12,588
They heard you trying
to send the spent casing

682
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:14,190
through the city sewer system.

683
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:20,463
(gun cocks)
What the...

684
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:21,998
Joey Salucci.

685
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:23,766
Know the name?

686
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:24,667
This is for Emma.

687
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:26,602
No!

688
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:27,570
(gunshot)

689
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:30,072
(clinks)

690
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,410
(muted club music playing)

691
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:46,622
What'd you do
with A.J.'s body?

692
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:48,724
What body?

693
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:54,897
Right.

694
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:56,565
I didn't think so.

695
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:58,567
Good luck pinning anything
on me.

696
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:00,136
CAINE:
Stick around, Mick.

697
00:35:00,202 --> 00:35:02,872
Take him.

698
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:12,148
What do you think
we should do now?

699
00:35:12,214 --> 00:35:13,983
You heard the man.

700
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,552
Let's take him up on his offer.

701
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:25,131
I can't believe a thug
like Mick Ragosa

702
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:27,133
gets to drive a sweet car
like this.

703
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,135
Well, not for long.

704
00:35:29,202 --> 00:35:30,536
We are so close

705
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:32,438
to finishing what William
Campbell started.

706
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,307
If we can prove
that this was

707
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:37,477
the car that Mick used to
transport A.J. Watkins's body--

708
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:39,846
which I have a hunch it is--

709
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:41,914
it'll be over.

710
00:35:46,986 --> 00:35:49,455
I've got blood.

711
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,599
Why stop there?

712
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,777
Nice murder kit.

713
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:15,181
Wait a second.

714
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:17,783
This shovel's got trace
on the end of it.

715
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,453
So, Mick transported A.J.'s
body in that car.

716
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,788
Maybe we can use that to prove
where he buried him.

717
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:24,056
I tell you what--

718
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,758
I'm going to process this
myself.

719
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:26,926
Don't worry, Calleigh.

720
00:36:26,993 --> 00:36:28,528
We're going to
get this guy.

721
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,676
H., the debris on the
edge of the shovel

722
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,278
is silica and quartz.

723
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:46,779
It's sand.

724
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:49,615
Yeah, which unfortunately
for us, is all too common.

725
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:52,785
What was not common, however,
was the morphology of the sand.

726
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:56,155
The, uh, the particles
were melted.

727
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:57,990
That burnt.
That's right.

728
00:36:58,057 --> 00:37:00,059
And the mass spec
picked up kerosene,

729
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:01,594
which leads me to believe

730
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:03,462
that A.J. Watkins was buried
at the beach

731
00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:04,630
near a bonfire.

732
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:05,798
And, unfortunately,

733
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:07,567
I can't be more specific
than that.

734
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,468
On the contrary,
Mr. Wolfe,

735
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:11,537
you've been very helpful.

736
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:21,314
Salucci wasn't
messing around.

737
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,649
He had Mick Ragosa bury
A.J. right on the spot

738
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:25,685
where his daughter
was killed.

739
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:27,019
Packed him tight, too.

740
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,088
Slowed decomp.

741
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,025
Hang on.

742
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:34,927
William Campbell said he only
heard one shot, right?

743
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:36,195
Yeah. Why?

744
00:37:36,262 --> 00:37:38,197
Well, the only entry wound
is in his kneecap.

745
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:40,733
He wouldn't have died
from that injury.

746
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,536
Why not shoot the killer?

747
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:44,704
I don't know.

748
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,738
Maybe you've got the answer.

749
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,039
Any idea on cause of death?

750
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,944
Yes, actually.

751
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:54,513
Looks like our killer planted
an American flag.

752
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,115
Excuse me?

753
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:58,117
Red eyes, white skin, blue lips.

754
00:37:58,184 --> 00:38:00,186
All consistent
with strangulation.

755
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:09,562
Actually, looks like his shirt
covered up some evidence here.

756
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:11,764
Got a thin residue
of something.

757
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,467
(garbled police radio
transmission)

758
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:20,106
Sometimes, even a touch of evil
can close the case.

759
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:26,646
So, A.J. Watkins
was strangled.

760
00:38:26,712 --> 00:38:29,081
Yeah, Tara confirmed
that at the post.

761
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:31,484
But the killer left
something behind.

762
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,985
Talk to me.

763
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:34,553
Calleigh found
some pollen

764
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,589
on the neck
of the victim.

765
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:37,990
Uh, said it's from a fly.

766
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:40,993
Problem is, there's over
a hundred varieties.

767
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,662
A lily.

768
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,039
I called the Dade U
botany department,

769
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:55,341
see if they could narrow
it down to one.

770
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:57,710
That's not going
to be necessary, Eric.

771
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:02,615
You found pollen on a dead guy.

772
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:03,649
So what?

773
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:06,018
It's not just any pollen,
Joseph.

774
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:08,654
White lily pollen.

775
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,655
(scoffs)

776
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,490
You'd stoop that low

777
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,325
to desecrate her burial site.

778
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,694
You did that all

779
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,128
by yourself.

780
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:17,496
You told me you go

781
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,533
to Emma's grave
every day.

782
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,835
This is over.

783
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,805
You know,

784
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:27,139
you can try everything

785
00:39:27,206 --> 00:39:30,476
in your pathetic little arsenal.

786
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:32,511
Ragosa's the guy.

787
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,513
He shot Watkins in cold blood.

788
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,649
It's his bullet, not mine.

789
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,651
Mick started the job on A.J.,

790
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:40,886
but you finished it off.

791
00:39:46,392 --> 00:39:47,827
(grunts)

792
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:49,061
Where are we?

793
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:50,696
What are you going
to do with me?!

794
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,198
(muffled screams)

795
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:56,035
(groans)

796
00:39:57,236 --> 00:39:58,637
(screams)

797
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:07,847
Judgment day, Watkins.
It was an accident.

798
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:09,615
(cries):
I swear to you.

799
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:11,617
I-I didn't,
I didn't see her lying there.

800
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:12,818
You gotta believe me!

801
00:40:12,885 --> 00:40:17,089
You can make up
all the excuses you want,

802
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:19,759
it's not going to bring
my daughter back.

803
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:20,993
What do you want me to do?

804
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,128
I'll do anything you want!

805
00:40:22,194 --> 00:40:23,662
Please!

806
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:34,206
This guy kills my only daughter.

807
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:36,709
And all he gets is a...

808
00:40:36,776 --> 00:40:39,278
"watch where you're going
next time."

809
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,017
(groaning)

810
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:10,376
You're not
the law, Joseph.

811
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:15,114
You and I both know
there's a big difference

812
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,983
between the law and justice.

813
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,007
He had to answer for
what he did.

814
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:26,759
So do you.

815
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:47,146
# #

816
00:42:04,763 --> 00:42:06,432
# #

817
00:42:36,629 --> 00:42:38,631
# #

818
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:09,929
