00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,504
"LOS OLVIDADOS"

2
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:22,245
This film is based on true facts.
No character is fictional.

3
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,333
Almost every capital
like New York, Paris, London

4
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,335
hides, behind its wealth,
poverty-stricken homes

5
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,533
where poorly-fed children,
deprived of health or school,

6
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,176
are doomed to criminality.

7
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,507
Society tries to provide a cure.

8
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,378
Success for its efforts
remains very limited.

9
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,781
The future is not bound
to the present:

10
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:06,186
The day will come when
children rights are respected.

11
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:11,663
Mexico, large modern city,
is no exception to the rule.

12
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,961
This film shows the real life.
It's not optimistic.

13
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,505
The solution to this problem is
left to the forces of progress.

14
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,432
Don't forget the others!

15
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,468
Who wants a cigarette?

16
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:00,876
You smoke?

17
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,515
No, that makes me cough.

18
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,445
I don't smoke either.

19
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,280
What a chicken!

20
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,148
Wimp!

21
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,016
I must go to work.

22
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,923
Only morons work.

23
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,026
Too bad. See you later.

24
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,286
How polite you are!

25
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,362
Hey!
You know who I've seen?

26
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,157
"Ja?o"!

27
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,561
He got away from
the reformatory prison.

28
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,927
Who's that, "Ja?o"?

29
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:33,443
Egg-sandwiches.
Who wants my sandwiches?

30
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,891
- One sandwich.
- At once.

31
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,619
With gherkins?

32
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,524
Put anything you want.

33
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,619
As I was telling you,

34
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,722
in prison, if you're a wimp,
they beat the shit out of you.

35
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,655
They're tough?

36
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,419
Yes, but if you're
tougher than them,

37
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,861
they respect you.

38
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,925
So they didn't bother you.

39
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,236
How is the grub?

40
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,267
Not bad.
And I took the best bed.

41
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,238
But the street is better.

42
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,812
That's why I got away
as soon as I had the chance.

43
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,116
You were not scared?
If they had caught you...

44
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,651
"Ja?o" fears no one.

45
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,321
It's Julian's fault
if they put you in jail?

46
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,558
It is. That bloody scared...

47
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,894
- Who gives me a cigarette?
- Not me.

48
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,563
- Me neither.
- What about you?

49
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,392
I've got no more.

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,465
No cigarette, no dough!

51
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,799
Without me, you're no good.

52
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,302
But I've learned a lot

53
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,771
and if you obey me
we'll all get dough.

54
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,239
You're a real tough-guy.

55
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,036
We'll do everything you want.

56
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,913
I'll sing you a song

57
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,485
from the time of
my general Don Porfirio.

58
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,321
You can laugh,
but on these days

59
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:04,122
people were more respectful
and women stayed at home.

60
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,425
Now they only think
to chase men.

61
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,330
This song will cost one peso.

62
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,902
I must sing to live.

63
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,377
The price of bread rises,
the price of my songs too.

64
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,518
This one is from the days of
my general Don Porfirio.

65
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,348
A coin of twenty centavos and
one of ten have just fallen.

66
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,493
- Here is the blind man.
- Fine.

67
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,427
You, "Baldie",
you swipe his bag.

68
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,502
You rush and give it to him,
who'll give it back to me.

69
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,798
You guys, you wait
where I told you.

70
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,031
What if I'm arrested?

71
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,039
You drop the "exhibit".

72
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,305
Don't get nabbed with it!

73
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,978
I know the law!

74
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,742
- Move!
- It's OK.

75
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,282
- What d'you want?
- Nothing.

76
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,357
Let me go then.

77
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,943
Keep away, son.

78
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,479
Tickle the bull's nostril.

79
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,983
Did he hit you hard?

80
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,520
He only scratched me.

81
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,027
What an asshole!

82
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,565
There was a nail
at the end of the stick.

83
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,963
It's deep!

84
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,400
Ask your mother to nurse you.

85
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,575
My mother?! If I go home,
she'll kill me.

86
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,404
Mine is a beast too.
That's why I left.

87
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,419
Nail pricks are bad.

88
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,750
Put a cobweb on it.
It's good against bleeding.

89
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,256
Pedro! Bring me one.

90
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,985
- I will.
- Hurry up!

91
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,693
With that, you get over it
or you lose your paw.

92
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,736
Is there a kind soul
to make me cross?

93
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,610
Who will have mercy
of a poor blind man?

94
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,440
Is there anybody to ...?

95
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,379
Why are you crying, my child?

96
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,213
My dad told me to wait here
and he doesn't come back.

97
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:20,518
He'll come back soon.
So, help me, I’m blind.

98
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,591
You do have small eyes.

99
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,463
The less we are, the better.
You guys, wait.

100
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,802
We'll "thank" him all right.

101
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,985
Feel pity for a poor
defenseless blind man.

102
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,719
Take that, bloody blind man!

103
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,158
In the head, "Baldie",
in the head!

104
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,781
Watch out, or you
gonna break your neck.

105
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,540
What do we eat?

106
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,409
- What is it?
- Nothing.

107
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,916
- Cool, some meat!
- Don't touch it.

108
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,420
You've been given meat?
That's impossible!

109
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,391
Don't touch it!

110
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,934
Where the hell have you been?

111
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,939
Over there... Looking for a job.

112
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,045
All night long?
Why do you come back?

113
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,772
Mum, I’m hungry.

114
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,816
I've told you not to come back
if you hang with these punks.

115
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,715
You don't realize
I work myself to death

116
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,890
washing floors
all day long.

117
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,324
I'm hungry!

118
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,690
Ask your friends to feed you.

119
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,361
Punk!

120
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,203
Why are you beating me?

121
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,171
To teach you a lesson,
ne'er-do-well !

122
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,274
You don't love me anymore.

123
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,413
It's your fault.

124
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,413
It was good!

125
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,150
You're not from here?

126
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,323
Yes... from the country.

127
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,288
If you're a peasant,
you're not from here!

128
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,927
Why did you come here?

129
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,096
I didn't come,
I've been brought.

130
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,195
Why?

131
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,194
I don't know.

132
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,094
You know nothing!

133
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,500
Hi, Pedro!

134
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,763
Hi, Julian!

135
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,406
You haven't seen my father?

136
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,340
I know where he is...

137
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,910
What a prick!

138
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,810
Now I'm hungrier than before.

139
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,249
Have you eaten?

140
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,286
No.

141
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,924
- You're hungry?
- A lot.

142
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,684
You got money?

143
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,263
Come on, Dad.
You can't stand anymore.

144
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,269
No. Let me go.

145
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,772
You ought to be ashamed.

146
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,208
You shouldn't judge your father.

147
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,076
l don't judge you, but
you could be hit.

148
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,843
- Mum is waiting.
- Let her wait!

149
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,024
Don't you get sick of
being drunk every night?

150
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,287
Me, drunk?

151
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,066
Yes, you are.

152
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,025
What a pity!

153
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,939
You work yourself to death
to feed us and I...

154
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,502
Forgive me, son.
I swear I'll stop drinking.

155
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,873
You always say that.

156
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,241
This time, it's true.

157
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,610
He's so drunk!

158
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,081
You got a problem with that?

159
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,254
No. Sorry.

160
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,454
Your lack of respect
gets on my nerves

161
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,718
Here we go again!

162
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,122
I'm your father after all!

163
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,499
What a drunkard!

164
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,433
OK...I'm leaving. Bye.

165
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,066
Give me that knife.

166
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm busy.

167
00:15:56,188 --> 00:16:00,022
Here, I’m less worthy than
an animal. Where's Metche?

168
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,424
Where are you?
I will die alone!

169
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,087
Find your sister to rub her.

170
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,130
She'll be back.

171
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,200
It's me, "Ja?o".

172
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,308
My stupid brother
always brings bums to us.

173
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,071
Wait. We'll talk.

174
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,175
But you were in prison?

175
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,817
I am where I want to be.
I've escaped.

176
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,750
Go away! lf they find you here,
it's gonna hurt.

177
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,617
- Want some help?
- No!

178
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,350
You've become so pretty
since the last time I saw you.

179
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,721
Keep quiet or I scream!

180
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,521
OK! Stay calm.

181
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,390
I gonna go.

182
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,969
Lie down or you're gonna cough
and we won't be able to sleep.

183
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,138
"Pimples"!

184
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,207
What?

185
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,142
I've fought with mum,
I've come to sleep here.

186
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,178
Who is it?

187
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,078
He was lost,
I felt sorry for him.

188
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,185
Come in and be quiet.

189
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,121
Mum is waiting for you.

190
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,052
Hi, "Ja?o"!

191
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,493
Pedro! Quite a crowd!

192
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,934
Who's that guy
with the small eyes?

193
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,833
Well... He's "Small Eyes".
I've found him at the market.

194
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,708
- You see me?
- Me? No.

195
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,569
Why have you brought him?
Beat it!

196
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,543
Leave him alone!

197
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,908
You don't have any family?

198
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,708
He could be a bastard.

199
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,112
I have a dad!

200
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,183
Where is he?

201
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,118
He told me to wait for him
but he didn't come back.

202
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,018
He's not from here.

203
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,124
We have to go.

204
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,489
Don't touch the animals
and be quiet.

205
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,029
Good night, Metche.

206
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,566
When I'm rich,
I'll marry you.

207
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,028
Don't worry about the chickens!

208
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,500
He said not to touch the animals,

209
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,541
when milk is so good
before going to bed!

210
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,017
They haven't left a drop!

211
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,651
Look at this one!

212
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,621
Leave us alone.
Pedro and I, we're leaving.

213
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,197
- Gimme your handkerchief.
- Why?

214
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,365
I'll give it back to you.

215
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,903
- My throat aches.
- Don't piss me off.

216
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,838
You, follow me.
You guys, see you later.

217
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,744
What about Julian?

218
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,907
-I saw him last night.
- Always at the same place?

219
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,343
No. He works at a building site.

220
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,249
Where?

221
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,978
I'll show you if you want.

222
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,856
Let's speak to him.

223
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:50,726
There he is.

224
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,228
Tell him I'm here.

225
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,127
Be careful, he hits hard.

226
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,200
Since he doesn't smoke,
he's never out of breath.

227
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,393
Get moving!

228
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,011
"Ja?o" wants to see you.

229
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,217
Why?

230
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,183
To speak with you.

231
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,118
lf he looks for a fight,
he'll get what he wants.

232
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,054
- He asks if you chicken out.
- I'll show him.

233
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,427
- I'll be back right away.
- Don't be too long.

234
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,793
- Just a minute.
- Go on.

235
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,036
What do you want?

236
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,730
I haven't seen you
in a while!

237
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,671
Why do you want to meet me?

238
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,505
I gotta talk with you...
but not here.

239
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:42,680
Anywhere you want.

240
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:43,905
Let's go.

241
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,713
We've walked enough.
Now talk!

242
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:55,051
You remember I’ve spent a year
in jail because of you.

243
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,659
- Because of me?
- Sure?

244
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,294
You gave me away.

245
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,828
I'd tell you if it was me,
you don't scare me.

246
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,092
I'm not a rat.

247
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,166
The guy who gave me away
will pay for it.

248
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,740
Bragger, you know I can't
beat you because of my arm.

249
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,743
Come back when you are well.
You'll see what you'll get.

250
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,643
I'll knock the shit out of you.

251
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,526
Stop that!

252
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:56,477
Let's go before he wakes.
That'll teach him.

253
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,656
Take that.

254
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,882
When he wakes up,
he won't miss us.

255
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,094
When he awakes,
I'll put him back to sleep.

256
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,329
Please, I'd like to cross.

257
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,367
Nobody hears
a poor blind man?

258
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm gonna help you, sir.

259
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,501
The guy from yesterday.
You still wait for your father?

260
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,335
Yes, sir.

261
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:23,344
He sure won't be back.

262
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,780
Today there's too much poverty,
too many mouths to feed.

263
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,684
Listen, son, I need
someone to help me.

264
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,756
Come with me, you'll have a home
and something to eat.

265
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:34,856
What about my dad?

266
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:39,124
We'll come back here
everyday. Take that.

267
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,293
If the police questions you,
I'm your godfather. Let's go.

268
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,371
Come in, Don Carmelo.

269
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,372
"Small Eyes", what are
you doing with him?

270
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:56,674
They call you "Small Eyes"?
What a stupid name!

271
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,252
Wait for me here.

272
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,589
Hi!

273
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,288
How does the patient feel?

274
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:14,295
Better... but left alone.

275
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,159
But your sons have grown up.

276
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,898
They're just hooligans,
always hanging around.

277
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,267
I know. There's nothing
to do here.

278
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,411
Turn around, please.

279
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,852
Virgin Mary!
Have pity! Heal me!

280
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,155
It works!
Look at the pigeon.

281
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,850
You gave him your disease.

282
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,963
When he dies, you'll be cured.

283
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,689
Virgin Mary, mother of God!

284
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,562
I can't bear this pain anymore.

285
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,846
What is my boss doing there?

286
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,676
It's for my sick mother.

287
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,583
Don Carmelo treats her
with a pigeon.

288
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,584
That's not good.

289
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,158
How do you know?

290
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,621
Look.

291
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,494
What is it?

292
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,101
It's a dead man's tooth.

293
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,795
It keeps bad luck away.
Its owner will never get sick.

294
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,066
Where did you find it?

295
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:35,040
At the graveyard.
I took it by moonlight.

296
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,043
Otherwise, it's worthless.

297
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,674
lf you want, I give it to you.

298
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,649
To me?

299
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,945
Take it.

300
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,119
Thanks.

301
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,791
So, stay in good health.

302
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,830
Metche, my bottle!

303
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,762
There you go, Don Carmelo.

304
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,137
From now on, "Small Eyes"
will come and get it.

305
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,272
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

306
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,498
Let's go away.

307
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,715
For health, nothing beats donkey milk.

308
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,619
Do you have a cigarette?

309
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,628
l don't support laziness.

310
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,500
Go and watch.

311
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,300
What d'you want?

312
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,874
A cigarette.

313
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,409
- Buy it.
- We've got no money.

314
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,411
Get some work, and you'll
be able to smoke.

315
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:48,814
Police!

316
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,454
Shut him up.

317
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,220
Police!

318
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,715
He's gonna like it!

319
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:57,587
Great!

320
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,457
Let him go.

321
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,288
Go now!

322
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,125
Take it!

323
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,885
One peso for each of you.

324
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,264
And it's not over.

325
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:39,392
I'm rusty.
You've seen nothing yet.

326
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,439
That cripple was
really scared to death.

327
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,137
Hey guys!

328
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,042
I've been looking for you.
You know what happened?

329
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,381
Julian was found dead.

330
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,750
- You're kidding!
- Julian?

331
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,913
Near his workplace.

332
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,220
He's lying over there.
There are a lot of people.

333
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,255
We know who did it?

334
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,191
Police says
he was killed from behind.

335
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,365
We gonna see him?

336
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,556
Let's go.

337
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,867
- Come with us, Pedro.
- Here we go.

338
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,698
- What's going on?
- Nothing!

339
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,874
You go, we'll follow you.

340
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,870
Come, quick!

341
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,890
You did kill him!

342
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,321
I didn't want to.

343
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,955
Now, you better shut your mouth

344
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,188
if you don't want
us to be arrested.

345
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,798
I did nothing.

346
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,200
You searched for him.
You took half the money.

347
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:50,101
If we get nabbed,
we'll be both sentenced.

348
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,470
So?

349
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,879
We have to split.

350
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,642
If they catch one of us,
not a word, OK?

351
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,715
OK.

352
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,583
Now we're bound together
forever, you got that?

353
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,274
Honey, what are you doing?

354
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,368
Listen to me, my darling,
you're not that bad.

355
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,135
Why did you do that?

356
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:11,975
l did nothing. It was "Ja?o".

357
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,716
I'd like to be
with you all the time.

358
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,321
But I'm very tired.

359
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,515
Look at my the hands,
worn-out by washing.

360
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,122
Why don't you ever kiss me?

361
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,923
Mum, I'm gonna behave.

362
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,101
I'll look for a job,
you'll be able to rest.

363
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,694
Yes, darling.

364
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,544
Mummy...

365
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,416
Why didn't you give me
some meat the other night?

366
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:34,528
Give it to me!
It's mine.

367
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,511
"APPRENTICE WANTED"

368
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,373
What are you looking at?

369
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,877
Milk... Nothing is better
for the skin.

370
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:57,775
What?

371
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:01,247
If you wash yourself
with it, your skin

372
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,851
looks like satin.

373
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,488
Bloody "Small Eyes"!
You know everything.

374
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,256
It's 'cause my mother went
to marriageable daughters'

375
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,222
doing their hair
and applying milk to them.

376
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,227
OK... we'll see tomorrow.

377
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,121
You told me the truth?

378
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,458
"Ja?o"!
You were still here?

379
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:47,824
As long as you are.

380
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,432
- If grandpa knows it...
- I don't give a shit.

381
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,001
- Hey, where are you going?
- What do you want?

382
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,694
- To see you.
- Get lost!

383
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,305
Stay, I won't eat you.

384
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,907
Don't approach me
or you'll get bashed.

385
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,078
Kiss me, I'll give you...

386
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,212
What?

387
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,847
Two pesos to buy
everything you want.

388
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,107
Show me.

389
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:09,712
Look.

390
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,921
Only one?

391
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,626
Leave me alone, don't touch me!
Stop that!

392
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,563
What's happening?

393
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,364
"Ja?o" has fun with my sister.

394
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,372
Let me go, brute beast!

395
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,541
Keep quiet.

396
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,073
Let me go!

397
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,778
Dirty beast, take that!

398
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,715
I'll tell it to mum.

399
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:44,683
You're gonna shut up?

400
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,189
No need to make
such a fuss for so little.

401
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:53,828
If you'd touch me,
I'd have smashed your face.

402
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,626
Let him go,
people could hear you.

403
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,132
You coward, you dare with him!

404
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,770
Come with me.

405
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,638
Let's go, grandpa can hear us.

406
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,800
He's not that deaf.

407
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,053
See you tomorrow, "Small Eyes".

408
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,463
Why are you looking at me?

409
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,364
For nothing.

410
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,129
What's the problem?

411
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,241
- Is it true that you...
- What?

412
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,878
killed Julian?

413
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,240
I did nothing.

414
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,541
I thought so.

415
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,844
- If you go on...
- Don't worry, I'm your friend.

416
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,681
You did it, it's your problem.

417
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,083
What are you doing here?
Who's that?

418
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,354
A pal who helps me.
You got a problem with that?

419
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,556
l want to see no one here.

420
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,291
Don't get mad, grandpa.

421
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,232
If he leaves, I'll leave too.

422
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,837
Right, clear off!

423
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,371
Let's scram!

424
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,773
What will you do?

425
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,679
I don't know. I've got no money.

426
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,322
You better hide for a few days.
We'll see you then.

427
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,383
I know a great place.
I'll lead you.

428
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,686
- Where?
- Come on.

429
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,717
I got you!
What are you looking for?

430
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,292
Some water. I live with
the blind in this house.

431
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,292
If I wanted,
I could knock you out.

432
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,091
If you ever tell you
saw me here, I'll kill you.

433
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,096
Yes, sir.

434
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,996
You know I keep my promises.

435
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,104
Wait.

436
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,799
Don't breathe a word!

437
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,817
Come here, "Small Eyes".

438
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,279
Who were you talking with?

439
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,957
With a passer-by.

440
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,559
You're lying. Nobody ever
passes through here.

441
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,729
He stood there, he left.

442
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:14,859
Who was it?

443
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,294
I don't know!

444
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,094
You'll tell me
or I tear your ear.

445
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,168
- "Ja?o".
- What?

446
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,033
He's called "Ja?o".

447
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,873
I forbid you to talk
to other people.

448
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,681
This "Ja?o" is sure
one of these lazy...

449
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:37,684
If I see you with him or
another one, I break your arm.

450
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,453
Today, you have all
bad company.

451
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,721
Before, it was different.

452
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,624
Grown-ups

453
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:50,628
were respected.

454
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,236
What was that,
"Small Eyes"?

455
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,269
A falling stone.

456
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:22,991
Go away!

457
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:30,469
Where's this scum
who killed my son?

458
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:35,476
Get out so I'll kill you!

459
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,042
They attacked him off-guard!

460
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,186
Bring that coward to me!

461
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,878
Be patient... Be patient!

462
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:14,151
I've got a job! Saturday,
I'll bring you seven pesos .

463
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,344
Bring that bowl.

464
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,387
Now, I’m gonna behave.

465
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,096
You see what you do
with such stupid things!

466
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,074
Dirty brat!

467
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,648
Stop knocking!

468
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,717
Look after the shop. If
someone comes, let him wait.

469
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:51,210
What d'you want?

470
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:52,404
Talking to you.

471
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:53,949
Not here!

472
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:54,981
That's important.

473
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,153
The boss will be back.

474
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,049
So what? You'll tell
him I'm a customer.

475
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,053
The story about Julian
begins to make trouble.

476
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:01,987
They know?

477
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,556
No...

478
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,525
But the police questions
all the neighborhood.

479
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,222
Since you knew him,
they'll come to see you.

480
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,229
They look for me
as a fugitive.

481
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,232
What will I tell them?

482
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,670
It depends...
First, you'll tell them...

483
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,705
Go away! Here's my boss!

484
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,274
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

485
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,036
I'll go to your place tonight.

486
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,483
- Did you see anyone?
- No sir.

487
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,678
You can go.

488
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,362
Have you seen
the silver-handled knife?

489
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,093
It was there.

490
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,704
It probably fell.

491
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,276
Get me some water.

492
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,078
Take the pitcher.

493
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,791
- Come on.
- Hurry up!

494
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,454
Hello.

495
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,187
Hello.
What do you want?

496
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,296
- Pedro's here?
- No, not yet.

497
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:24,440
I must join him here.
If you don't mind, I'll wait.

498
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,200
As you like.

499
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,418
Must be great to have a mother!

500
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,455
When I see you, I envy Pedro.

501
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,221
I don't even know
what's my name.

502
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,798
My father...I've never known
who he was.

503
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,027
My mother died
when I was a child.

504
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,535
Do you remember her?

505
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:01,742
No... just once
when I was a child.

506
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:05,438
It seems I got attacks...
like convulsions.

507
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,447
Once, after an attack,

508
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,347
I saw the face of a woman,

509
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,584
very close to me.

510
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,757
She was looking at me kindly,
with a sad look.

511
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,554
She was crying. That's why
I thought she was my mother.

512
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,922
And you remember that?

513
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,099
Yes, because nobody ever
looked at me like that again.

514
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,834
Maybe it was a dream.

515
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,142
What did she look like?

516
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:36,871
She looked like the Virgins
you see in church.

517
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,380
A policeman asks for you!

518
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,578
- For me?
- Yes, a cop.

519
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,814
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

520
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,409
Well, come in.

521
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,896
You know for my Julian?
They killed him.

522
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:36,231
He loved you so much.

523
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,670
My darling... so nice...
What will happen to us?

524
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:43,210
He was working for us.
Who killed him?

525
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,075
- What?
- You know it.

526
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,306
I swear I don't know.

527
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,610
- Yes you do.
- No!

528
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,888
Try to learn who killed
him and tell me,

529
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,115
so I catch him and I...

530
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,292
Pedro!

531
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:58,825
Are you sure?

532
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,157
Yes, your son was at the shop.

533
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,627
He was the only one
able to steal the knife.

534
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,232
My brother has stolen nothing.

535
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:05,163
Shut up.

536
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,427
Cigarette?

537
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,903
I don't know what to do
with that boy.

538
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,406
He stays out all night, I never
know where he spends the day,

539
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,440
and now...

540
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:17,011
It's serious. If the theft is
proved, he'll be jailed.

541
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,512
Good, I don't care.

542
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,481
When he gets back, take
him away and thrash him.

543
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,779
Thrash him
until he understands.

544
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,092
You, beat it!

545
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:20,270
It's ours!

546
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,301
Did you buy it?

547
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,565
Faster!

548
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:52,962
We're tired.

549
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,695
You'll get a rest
when you're dead.

550
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:59,842
- When do we eat?
- First you work.

551
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,274
Give me the money
you owe me.

552
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,412
Here you are!
You lazy bunch!

553
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:12,047
If that crook doesn't pay us,
we'll ruin him.

554
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:20,288
Is Pedro here?

555
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,465
He haven't come home
since the other night.

556
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,964
That's strange. Something
must have happened to him.

557
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,658
Only God knows!

558
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,997
Tonio has put a marble
in his mouth.

559
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,236
Give me what you've got
in the mouth.

560
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,686
You got married very young?

561
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,688
I was fourteen
when Pedro was born.

562
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,861
Your husband is still alive?

563
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,130
No, he died five years ago.

564
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,336
Small dogs.

565
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,699
Let's go see them!

566
00:49:57,861 --> 00:49:59,294
You already leave?

567
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,189
Please, for the band.

568
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,160
"Small Eyes"!

569
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,228
Pedro, what're you doing here?

570
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,301
You see, I work.

571
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:42,563
What's going on
over there?

572
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,637
As usual.

573
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,070
You've seen the gang?

574
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,803
I meet "Pimples"
when I go for the milk.

575
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,843
- And "Ja?o"?
- Also.

576
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,141
The cops didn't arrest him?

577
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,814
Go to work!

578
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,388
Where did you see "Ja?o"?

579
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:04,560
He sleeps besides the place
where I live with the blind.

580
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,127
- They don't look for me?
- No.

581
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:10,625
- Really?
- Nobody knows where you are.

582
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,769
Get lost!

583
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,241
Where are you going?

584
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,037
Where have you been lately?

585
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,144
Around here, in the street.

586
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,043
I work for a carousel.

587
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,317
Why did you come back?
You should stay there.

588
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,486
I ran away...
Can't say why.

589
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,454
But I didn't do anything bad.

590
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,184
Don't stand like that.
Beat me instead.

591
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,456
Don't touch me.

592
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:22,604
I'd like to behave,
but I don't know how .

593
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,935
You're like that with me because
of "Ja?o", it's his fault.

594
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:29,176
Why are you doing that?

595
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,610
Because you're a punk,
a thief!

596
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,784
You went at the shop
only for stealing.

597
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,213
I didn't steal anything!

598
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,212
I'll bring you
where you deserve.

599
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:46,954
You'd dare to do that?

600
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,925
No, Mum...
Bring me where you want.

601
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:09,112
We couldn't get
the proof of his guilt.

602
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:12,948
But since you can't
educate him properly,

603
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,681
we send him
to the farm-school.

604
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,883
We need your authorization.

605
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,291
- As you want.
- Sign here.

606
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,193
- I can't write.
- Draw a cross.

607
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,091
I suppose you wish
to meet him?

608
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:26,767
No... what for?

609
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,402
We should punish
the parents

610
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,369
for the way they
raise their children.

611
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,408
Deprived of affection,
they look for it anywhere.

612
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:39,306
I work all day long
so we can eat.

613
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,215
You don't love your son?

614
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:46,521
Why should I love him? I don't
even know who his father is.

615
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,793
That's OK...
but go and see him.

616
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:55,096
- Lead her.
- Follow me.

617
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,634
What has he done?

618
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:08,833
I don't know.

619
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,720
The judge told me to see you.

620
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,622
You don't talk?

621
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,823
You'll be sent
to the farm-school.

622
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,627
I don't want to go.
I've done nothing.

623
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,700
You're the one who
had me locked up.

624
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:34,801
Listen, my son...

625
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,199
"My son"?!

626
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,604
I came home just to see you,
you bring me here,

627
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:43,540
and now, you feel sorry for me!
It's your fault.

628
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:52,015
But you have... stolen the knife.

629
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:57,121
I stole nothing! I've told it
constantly to the judge.

630
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,325
Why would I lie?

631
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:00,621
Who is it , then?

632
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:04,425
The cops have to find him.
That's their job.

633
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:09,270
They've sent you
to make me talk?

634
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:12,071
Pedro!

635
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:16,376
Yes, that's why you're here.

636
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,673
Why don't you beat me?

637
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:22,579
You've brought me here.
Don't play the good mum.

638
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,479
I believe you, my darling.

639
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,122
Now, you remember
I'm your darling.

640
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:56,741
I want to go!
I've stolen nothing! Mum!

641
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:08,127
I couldn't come back
since the other night.

642
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:12,293
I've learned about Pedro,
that's why I'm here.

643
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,835
I want to see him.

644
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,135
- I'll help you.
- Drop it.

645
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,442
I'm so sorry!

646
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,776
They arrested the guy and

647
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,613
they could make him talk.

648
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:36,355
Don't worry.
He didn't rat on you.

649
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,153
To rat on me?

650
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:40,518
Why?

651
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,556
You met him on the
day of the theft.

652
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:45,735
Me?

653
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,770
I see you're in
a bad mood, I'm leaving.

654
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,032
Don't ever come back.

655
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:13,692
When you're neat and tidy,
you're another man.

656
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:18,023
Your file says you can't read
and you're accused of stealing.

657
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,133
I've stolen nothing.

658
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:23,905
Don't be afraid.
You're not in jail here.

659
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,974
You will learn to read
and to get a job,

660
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,611
like... mechanic.

661
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,013
A boy like you was here.

662
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,652
Now he drives a locomotive.

663
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,514
- I want to leave.
- Why?

664
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:39,881
I've done nothing.

665
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,886
You're a good boy?

666
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,685
No, but I haven't stolen
the knife.

667
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,663
Apparently you like animals.

668
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:53,734
You'll be delighted
in working here.

669
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:58,101
Put him at the poultry farming.

670
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,898
After... we'll see.

671
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:42,782
Hey, don't do that!

672
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:43,816
What?

673
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,080
- Don't do that.
- We sell the eggs.

674
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,780
I do whatever I want.

675
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,191
We'll call the principal.

676
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:52,986
Go on.

677
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,425
Rat!

678
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,398
- Give it to me.
- Watch out or I bash you up.

679
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,762
I'd like to see that!

680
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,969
Drop that stick!

681
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,709
Lock him until he cools off.

682
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,181
Go back to work.

683
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:59,387
What are we going
to do with him?

684
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:04,329
Let him think it over
and give him some food.

685
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,559
People are better
when they're full up.

686
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,828
After... we'll see.

687
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:10,164
Why are you smiling?

688
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:15,640
For nothing. If we could lock
poverty up instead of children...

689
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,090
Follow me.

690
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,814
You're quieter, aren't you?

691
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:01,187
Why did you kill the hens?

692
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,119
I don't know.

693
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,694
I do. Since you think
you're in jail,

694
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:09,456
you believe we all hate you
and you wanted to kill us.

695
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,464
But you couldn't do it so
the hens paid for us, right?

696
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,500
Yes, sir.

697
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,339
Be careful. Hens may
have their revenge too.

698
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,677
It's not a jail here.

699
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:31,743
Look at the door.

700
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:35,318
There aren't any policemen.
It's always opened.

701
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,921
As I want to win your trust...

702
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:41,289
Take that.

703
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,567
You can go out. There is a
tobacco shop on the right.

704
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,330
I give you 50 pesos.
I've got no change.

705
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,031
Bring me a pack of cigarettes
like this one.

706
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,705
What are you waiting for?
Go on!

707
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:05,615
- You've got a lot of money.
- I want more!

708
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,586
This educational method
will cost you a fortune.

709
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,951
If you give to all of them...

710
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,857
Not to all, each one
has a different problem,

711
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:17,658
but this boy needs
trust and affection.

712
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,095
What if he won't come back?

713
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:22,829
I'll lose 50 pesos. You have
to pay for your mistakes.

714
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:35,315
Pedro!

715
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,443
What're you doing here?

716
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:41,783
I've learned you were here
so I've come to see you.

717
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:43,889
They let you go out?

718
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,219
I do some shopping.

719
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:49,159
They trust you!
You gave me away?

720
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,354
I'm not a rat.

721
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,558
- You've told nothing?
- Nothing.

722
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,100
Good for you!

723
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:55,500
Move.

724
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,370
You know what happens
when I'm betrayed?

725
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:05,006
When I was arrested for the
knife, you said nothing.

726
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:09,674
Who remembers that?
Besides, they let you go out.

727
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,716
A 50 pesos bill!

728
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:14,984
Who gave it to you?

729
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:16,249
The principal.

730
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:19,986
Well, he won't see it again.
Come on, clear off.

731
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,255
- I wanna go back to school.
- You're crazy.

732
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:23,557
I want to go back.

733
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,199
Give me the bill.

734
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,670
Give it to me or
I’ll break your wrist.

735
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:07,203
Pedro!

736
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:14,444
He's angry with me.

737
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,515
You're not annoyed anymore?

738
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:17,708
Give me that money.

739
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,648
Which money?

740
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,516
The 50 pesos you've
stolen from me.

741
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:21,417
Me?

742
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,491
- I want that bill.
- Why?

743
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,183
To give it back to the principal.

744
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,524
You're a chicken.

745
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,631
And you a thief.

746
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,132
Go back with your mother.

747
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,336
Don't talk about my mother.

748
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:40,739
It wasn't enough!

749
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,712
Go ahead, "Ja?o"!

750
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,432
Bastards!

751
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:36,431
Leave him alone.

752
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:57,517
You won't get me
like Julian!

753
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,445
You're lying!

754
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:00,346
It's him, I saw him!

755
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:01,955
Liar!

756
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:04,319
You clubbed him to death.

757
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,820
That's him,
we must call the police!

758
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,158
You'll pay for that!

759
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,600
He runs away! Police!

760
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,066
Let's go or we'll
all be arrested.

761
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:25,846
All these criminals
should be hung by their feet.

762
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:28,846
In my General's days,
no one dared say a word.

763
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:33,511
A bread thief
was shot as an example.

764
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:35,054
But now we're helpless.

765
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,987
Julian was a good boy!

766
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,161
Good people always leave.

767
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:42,224
What do you want?

768
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,127
Please, bring me to
the police station.

769
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,929
I know things about "Ja?o".

770
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:52,364
- To the police station?
- Yes, go on!

771
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:04,045
- You're alone?
- Yes, come in.

772
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:05,317
What's up with you?

773
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:09,685
Nothing.
"Ja?o" still sleeps here?

774
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:11,086
Yes, but very late.

775
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,021
Where does he sleep?

776
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,821
in the empty house next door.

777
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:14,928
Hi!

778
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,700
Here the blind man.
What are we doing?

779
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,338
Hide yourself.
Don't make a noise.

780
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,844
Still sick?

781
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,249
Yes, sir.

782
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:44,489
If you could eat,
you'd be cured.

783
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,627
But you have to work
if you want to eat.

784
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,925
You're so lazy!

785
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:58,935
Good evening Don Carmelo.
I bring you the milk.

786
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,577
Thanks, girl.
It went out of my mind.

787
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:06,078
With what happens
in this neighborhood...

788
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,350
I leave now.

789
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:10,778
This is for the milk.

790
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:13,080
Thanks.

791
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:16,582
Ah my wonderful Metche!
Sit down.

792
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:19,590
You're a good girl.

793
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:22,191
Your hair smells good.

794
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,857
But I never wash it.

795
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:27,065
You don't need to

796
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,497
at your age.

797
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:33,038
There's nothing better
than natural scent.

798
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:36,734
It's a pity that God
deprived me of my eyes.

799
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:43,015
You must be beautiful as an angel
but naughty like a devil.

800
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,277
I'm leaving.

801
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:48,253
Wait, I'll give you something.

802
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:53,656
Two candies for
my little Metche.

803
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:56,689
But before...

804
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:00,763
"Small Eyes"!

805
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:03,869
Come here!

806
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:06,731
What was it?

807
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,502
Something has... fallen, Sir.

808
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,980
That's why you've
pretended to be sick?

809
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,751
To let thieves
like you come in?

810
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,757
Let me go.
They weren't thieves.

811
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,988
I'll kill you, punk.

812
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:33,066
"Ja?o" is the criminal!
He wants to kill me!

813
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,669
Old brute!
Don't hit him!

814
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,963
Run!

815
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,272
- Old fool!
- Get out of here!

816
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:45,138
Your father was right
to leave you.

817
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,845
Snakes!

818
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:50,142
We'll be done with

819
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,717
all of you soon.

820
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,450
Metche, you've seen my son?

821
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:26,416
Your son? No.

822
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,228
Why did you lie?

823
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,497
Because she knows he escaped.

824
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,599
She looks for him to...

825
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,193
What will you do?

826
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:46,136
Don't know. I'll look for
my dad at the market.

827
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,236
I've got one peso.

828
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,806
Take it and buy some food.

829
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,018
Thanks. Bye.

830
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,182
Take care.

831
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:06,357
Take your tooth.
It'll protect you.

832
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:43,888
He can't escape.

833
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:47,068
But you'll have to wait,
he comes late.

834
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:05,411
"Ja?o"!

835
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:09,415
I'm gonna make you pay.

836
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,533
Stop, don't kill me!

837
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:40,140
Grandpa!

838
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:44,708
There's someone in the barn.
The beasts are nervous.

839
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:07,566
It's Pedro!

840
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,074
He's been killed.

841
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,307
I know who did it, Grandpa.

842
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:16,644
Shut up, we could be accused
to be his accomplices.

843
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,114
I don't want the police
coming to my place.

844
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,947
What're we gonna do?

845
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:26,085
We load the donkey with him,
and we'll drop him somewhere.

846
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,421
Quick, get dressed!

847
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,146
Stop or I shoot!

848
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:01,259
One to go...

849
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:05,095
They'll all end up like that.

850
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:10,633
They should be killed
before birth.

851
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,899
You've been fixed, "Ja?o".

852
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:16,475
Right in the head.

853
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:20,048
Watch out, here's the mangy dog.

854
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,376
Look, he's coming.

855
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:29,049
That's it, I’m falling
into the black hole.

856
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:30,981
I'm alone.

857
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,952
Alone!

858
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:37,361
As always, boy,
as always.

859
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,531
Ne pense plus ... rien.
Stop thinking.

860
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:41,860
Sleep, boy.

861
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:43,597
Sleep.

862
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:55,774
Good evening.
