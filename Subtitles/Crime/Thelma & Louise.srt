Darryl, calm down, please.

537
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:51,525
Don't get so mad.

538
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:52,961
See, Louise...

539
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:54,925

00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:11,520
We'll just be gone

546
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:14,076
No, you'll be back today.

547
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:17,046
Get your butt
back here, Thelma, now.

548
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:18,527
Goddamn it!

549
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:20,519
Darryl...

550
00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:27,083
Darryl, you're my husband,
not my father.

551
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,045
Oh, now, that does it.

552
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:31,881
That Louise ie a bad influence.

553
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:34,960
If you're not back here
by tonight...

554
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:38,281
Thelma!

555
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:42,399
Well, then, I juet
don't want to say.

556
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,561
Darryl.

557
00:37:45,648 --> 00:37:47,445
Thelma?

558
00:37:47,528 --> 00:37:49,917
Go fuck yourself.

559
00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:54,277
Oh, that's good.
That'e just sweet.

560
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:02,132
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

561
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:05,492
- Did I cause that?
- No, I'm sorry.

562
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:09,455
Are you OK? Is there
something I can do for you?

563
00:38:09,536 --> 00:38:11,413
No. It's OK.

564
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:17,766
Crazy women.

565
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:00,773
Excuse me, ma'am.

566
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:03,324
Could I ask
where you're heading?

567
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:05,532
I'm trying to
get back to school,

568
00:39:05,616 --> 00:39:07,686
and my ride fell through.

569
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,574
I was thinking
if you're going my way,

570
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:12,806
or I'm going your way...

571
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,852
We're going to Oklahoma City.

572
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,927
- Perfect.
- I'm not sure.

573
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:19,291
Well, I'd
appreciate it much.

574
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:23,085
Well, see,
it's really not up to me.

575
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:25,087
It'e not my car.

576
00:39:25,176 --> 00:39:29,294
We'd have to ask my friend,
but she'd probably eay no.

577
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:31,332
She's a little uptight.

578
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:35,170
Maybe it's not a good idea,
but thank you for your time.

579
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:38,566
I mean, I can ask.
It wouldn't hurt.

580
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:40,886
Well, no, it wouldn't hurt.

581
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:48,452
Louiee, this young man
ie on his way back to school.

582
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:51,096
Since we're going
the same direction,

583
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:54,009
we could give him
a ride, huh?

584
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:58,890
Lt'e probably not a good idea.

585
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:03,166
Probably not, but I
appreciate your time.

586
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:05,531
You all have a good day.

587
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:07,493
Louiee...

588
00:40:11,696 --> 00:40:14,290
Did you see how polite he is?

589
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:15,855
Thelma.

590
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:17,085
What?

591
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:21,493
Cheer up, now. Bye.

592
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,813
Fill 'er up.

593
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,252
[Thelma] I wish we could
have brought him with us.

594
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:38,169
What did Darryl have to eay?

595
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:43,284
He said, "I just wanted
to make sure you wae all right.

596
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:46,652
"I hope you're having fun.
You deserve it.

597
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,772
"I love you."

598
00:40:54,296 --> 00:40:57,811
So how long before
we're in goddamn Mexico?

599
00:41:16,536 --> 00:41:19,528
[Thelma] I just didn't
think it would hurt

600
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,607
to give somebody a ride.

601
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:23,766
Did you see his butt?

602
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,051
Darryl don't have a cute butt.

603
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:30,095
You could park a car
in the shadow of his aes.

604
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:33,851
[Louise] I'm sorry.
I'm not in the mood for company.

605
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:39,249
Here. Find all
the secondary roads

606
00:41:39,336 --> 00:41:41,406
to Mexico
from Oklahoma City.

607
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:44,010
We should etay
off the interstate.

608
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:51,289
We could get on this road, 81,
and head down towards Dallas.

609
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:54,413
No. I don't want
to go through Texae.

610
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:02,650
Wait. You want to go
to Mexico from Oklahoma,

611
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:04,647
but not through Texae?

612
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:08,649
Thelma, you know how
I feel about Texas.

613
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,887
Louiee, we're running
for our livee.

614
00:42:11,976 --> 00:42:13,887
Can't you make an exception?

615
00:42:13,976 --> 00:42:19,175
The only thing between
Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!

616
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:22,168
Thelma, I'm not going
to talk about thie!

617
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:24,212
Find another way, or I will!

618
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:27,174
- Understand?
- No, Louise, I don't.

619
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:31,568
How come you never told me
what happened to you there?

620
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:38,975
Look, if you shoot a guy
with his pante down,

621
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:43,572
Texas is not the place
to get caught.

622
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,055
Truet me!

623
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:24,886
Happy birthday, lady.

624
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:29,766
<i>You know you could have been</i>
<i>some cool crook</i>

625
00:43:29,851 --> 00:43:33,480
<i>And baby you're so smart</i>

626
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:36,802
<i>You know you could have</i>
<i>been a school book</i>

627
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:41,760
<i>Well, you could have been</i>
<i>anything that you wanted to</i>

628
00:43:41,851 --> 00:43:45,844
<i>And I can tell, the way</i>
<i>you do the things you do</i>

629
00:43:45,931 --> 00:43:50,322
<i>The way you do</i>
<i>the things you do</i>

630
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:08,007
Is the manager in?

631
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:11,163
Marian, there's
a police officer here.

632
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:32,046
<i>[Whimpers like a dog]</i>

633
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:34,602
All right, Thelma.

634
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:36,449
<i>[Panting]</i>

635
00:44:36,531 --> 00:44:37,520
OK.

636
00:45:07,091 --> 00:45:11,130
The other night, there was
a murder at the Silver Bullet.

637
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:12,769
A man was shot.

638
00:45:12,851 --> 00:45:18,847
Some witneeses saw
a 1966 T-bird convertible

639
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:23,083
leaving the scene,
speeding out of the driveway.

640
00:45:23,171 --> 00:45:26,607
That vehicle is
registered to Louise Sawyer,

641
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:29,205
and we have reaeon to believe

642
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:33,284
that your wife was the other
occupant of that car.

643
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:35,884
What?

644
00:45:38,411 --> 00:45:40,402
What?

645
00:45:40,691 --> 00:45:42,443
[Darryl] What?

646
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,807
You're standing in your pizza.

647
00:45:45,891 --> 00:45:48,121
Oh, shit!

648
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:51,849
Mies Thelma,
how come you ain't got kide?

649
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:55,207
God gives you something special,
you should pass it on.

650
00:45:55,291 --> 00:46:01,082
Well, Darryl - my husband -
says he'e not ready yet.

651
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:03,844
He saye he's etill
too much of a kid.

652
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:06,081
Prides himeelf
on being infantile.

653
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:07,604
He should be proud.

654
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:11,604
- Louise and him don't get on.
- That'e putting it mildly.

655
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:13,170
He's a pig.

656
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:16,482
Did you get married
real young, Miss Thelma?

657
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:20,086
Well, I guese 18
ie kind of young.

00:46:20,171 --> 00:46:21,923
<i>[Honking]</i>

659
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:25,800
We'd been going out four years
when we got married.

660
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:27,847
- How long?
- Four years.

661
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:30,161
I never been
with anybody else.

662
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:32,401
Oh, I'm sorry.

663
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:35,528
Well, if you don't mind
me eaying so,

664
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:37,920
he sounds like an asehole.

665
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:41,763
That'e OK. He ie an asshole.

666
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:44,081
Mostly, I let it slide.

667
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:49,328
You better slow down.
That'e a cop up ahead.

668
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:28,367
Maybe you've got
a few parking tickete?

669
00:47:28,451 --> 00:47:32,888
We'll take you to Oklahoma City,
then you'd best be on your way.

I'll be damned.
Isn't that strange?

672
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:49,043
And the husband says
a gun is missing.

673
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:51,087
She took a lot of stuff.

674
00:47:51,171 --> 00:47:54,846
It looke like she maybe planned
on being gone a while.

675
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:59,049
Her husband said
she'd never touch that gun.

676
00:47:59,131 --> 00:48:02,840
He got it for her
because he's out late a lot,

677
00:48:02,931 --> 00:48:06,560
but he eaid
she'd never touch it,

678
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:09,245
just kept it in the drawer.

00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:11,640

- .38.

680
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:13,289
Right. Where are they?

They left for some guy's cabin.

00:49:03,323 --> 00:49:08,192
Can I have another room, please?
Put it on my credit card.

695
00:49:16,283 --> 00:49:18,751
Thelma. Thelma,
get your foot down.

696
00:49:18,843 --> 00:49:23,155
- Look who'e here.
- Oh, shit! Jimmy! Hi.

697
00:49:23,243 --> 00:49:25,074
What are you doing here?

698
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:28,678
Ask me no queetions
and I'll tell you no lies.

699
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:30,993
Same goes double for me.

700
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:33,039
Who'e the cowboy?

701
00:49:33,123 --> 00:49:35,273
- This is JD.
- How do.

702
00:49:35,363 --> 00:49:36,762
He's gone.

703
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:39,755
We're giving him a ride to here.

704
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:43,040
Then Louise
said he'd have to go.

705
00:49:43,123 --> 00:49:44,875
Yep. That's what I'm doing.

706
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:46,521
He's gone.

707
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:50,359
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.

708
00:49:52,843 --> 00:49:54,754
Yep. That's him going.

709
00:49:54,843 --> 00:49:57,152
[Thelma] I love watching him go.

710
00:49:57,243 --> 00:49:59,518
[Louise]
Thelma kind of took to him.

711
00:49:59,603 --> 00:50:03,835
[Jimmy]
I got you a room, Thelma.
Take a nice cold shower.

712
00:50:03,923 --> 00:50:06,198
[Thelma]
I'm juet a wild woman.

713
00:50:17,963 --> 00:50:20,079
It'e our future.

714
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:30,154
What will you tell him?

715
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:35,152
Nothing. I'm not going
to tell him a thing.

716
00:50:35,243 --> 00:50:39,714
The least I can do is not make
him more of an accessory.

717
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:42,192
You are eo sweet to that guy.

718
00:50:42,283 --> 00:50:45,400
Imagine not wanting
to drag him into this.

719
00:50:45,483 --> 00:50:47,360
I didn't invite him.

720
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:50,321
He's like any guy.
He loves the chaee.

721
00:50:50,403 --> 00:50:54,601
He's got his work cut out
for him now, don't he?

722
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:56,275
Put a lid on it!

723
00:50:58,883 --> 00:51:04,241
Now... I want you to just...
You guard that money.

724
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:06,075
OK.

725
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:10,122
And if there's any problem,
call me in room 211.

726
00:51:11,523 --> 00:51:13,002
OK.

727
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:14,994

I'm not going to tell you.

Some day soon
you'll understand why I can't.

734
00:51:49,362 --> 00:51:51,398
Can I ask you one thing?

735
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:52,756
Maybe.

736
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:54,958
Do you love eomebody else?

737
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:58,637
Does this have something
to do with another man?

738
00:51:58,722 --> 00:52:00,713
No, it's not anything like that.

739
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:07,961
What ie it? Are you
gonna leave for fucking ever?

740
00:52:09,442 --> 00:52:11,956
Did you fucking kill somebody?

Here.

747
00:52:48,642 --> 00:52:51,110
Why don't you try it on?

748
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:57,034
You didn't see
that one coming, did you?

749
00:52:57,122 --> 00:52:59,078
Why, Jimmy?

750
00:53:01,882 --> 00:53:03,554
Why now?

751
00:53:04,802 --> 00:53:07,236
Try not to get
too excited, Louise.

00:53:07,322 --> 00:53:09,711

755
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:19,752
You came all this way

756
00:53:19,842 --> 00:53:23,039
because you thought
I was with somebody else.

757
00:53:24,282 --> 00:53:26,842
No. That's not why I came.

758
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:33,676
Because, you know,
I don't want to lose you.

that's what you wanted.

I know I'm supposed to be
gone and all but, you know...

770

00:54:54,922 --> 00:54:57,390
No. I do love you...

let go of the old mietakee.

bad timing.

What did you rob?

810
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:49,201
Well, let's eee.
Let's add it up here.

811
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,564
Robbed a gae station,

812
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,165
a couple convenience stores,
liquor storee.

813
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,400
Oh, my God.

814
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,283
How?

00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,649

816
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,642
OK. First, you pick your place.

817
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:11,723
Then I sit back and watch it
for a little while,

818
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,768
wait for that right moment
to make my move.

819
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,966
That ehit cannot be taught.

820
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,804
And... Shit, I don't want
to talk about thie.

821
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,642
I do.

822
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:25,889
All right.

823
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:29,167
Then I'd waltz right in.

824
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:33,564
Yep. I just waltz
on in and I say,

825
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:37,165
"Let's see who wins the prize
for keeping their cool.

00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,081
"Everybody on the floor."

got a great story to tell.

00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:53,644
"If not, you got a tag
on your toe. You decide."

831
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,039
Simple as that.

832
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,280
Then I just slip on out

833
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:03,001
and get the hell out of Dodge.

834
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:08,563
My goodnees. You were
gentlemanly about it.

835
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,323
I've always believed,
if done properly,

836
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:15,039
armed robbery doesn't have to be
a totally unpleaeant experience.

837
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:19,644
- What?
- You're a real live outlaw.

838
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,800

stealing my heart.

Remember when we first met?

845
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,411
Yeah.

846
00:58:46,058 --> 00:58:48,014
Tell me what you said.

847
00:58:48,098 --> 00:58:51,010
I said you had
a nice pair of eyes.

848
00:58:52,618 --> 00:58:55,530
And what did I say?
Do you remember?

849
00:58:57,338 --> 00:58:59,727
Yeah. You shut them,

850
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:03,174

what colour they were.

851
00:59:03,258 --> 00:59:05,567

852
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:08,854
I didn't know.

853
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:15,690

Oh, ien't that nice?

1039
01:14:14,312 --> 01:14:16,542

Oh, look. How original.

- Thank you.

1043
01:14:36,992 --> 01:14:41,349
- Man, that's disgusting!
- You pig. Just a fucking pig.

1044
01:14:41,432 --> 01:14:45,789
- What's he got to do that for?
- They think we like it.

- Yeah. Who wants to know?

1048
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:31,222
Arkansas State Police.

1049
01:16:04,752 --> 01:16:06,185
Hi.

1050
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:45,543
[Louise] Thelma!

1051
01:16:47,712 --> 01:16:49,509
What?

1052
01:16:49,592 --> 01:16:53,471
- Call Darryl.
- What for?

1053
01:16:57,792 --> 01:17:00,306
Find out if he knows anything.

1054
01:17:00,392 --> 01:17:02,906
If you think he does, hang up,

1055
01:17:02,992 --> 01:17:05,950
because the phone's
probably tapped.

1056
01:17:06,032 --> 01:17:09,741
Tapped the phone?
What are you talking about?

1057
01:17:09,832 --> 01:17:12,904
Oh, come on!
Murder one and armed robbery?

1058
01:17:12,992 --> 01:17:15,745
We can't even say
it was self-defence?

1059
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:19,427
- It waen't. We walked away.
- But they don't know that.

1060
01:17:19,512 --> 01:17:23,710
I'll say he raped me
and you had to shoot him.

1061
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:25,908
- It won't work.
- Why not?

1062
01:17:25,992 --> 01:17:27,983
There's no physical evidence.

1063
01:17:28,072 --> 01:17:32,862
We can't even prove by now
that he touched you.

1064
01:17:32,952 --> 01:17:37,150
God! The law is some
tricky shit, isn't it?

1065
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:43,670
How do you know
about all this stuff?

1066
01:17:43,752 --> 01:17:46,266
What would we say
about the robbery?

1067
01:17:46,352 --> 01:17:49,025
There's no such thing
ae justifiable robbery.

1068
01:17:49,112 --> 01:17:51,672
All right!
Where did you get this?

1069
01:17:51,752 --> 01:17:53,549
Stole it.

1070
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,513
Hi.

1071
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,799

1072
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,399
Huh?

1073
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,316
- Who's the nut?
- Mre Dickinson's husband.

1074
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:20,076
Well, shit twice
and fall back in it. God!

1075
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,312
Where did you get the $6,600?

1076
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,714
A friend.

1077
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,756
A gentleman told us

1078
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,628
he delivered close to that
amount to Louise Sawyer.

1079
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,757
- Do you know her?
- Uh, yes, eir.

1080
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,071
I believe she's the woman
driving the car.

1081
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,911
He said he took her
to an Oklahoma City motel.

1082
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,911
He saye he met a man.

1083
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,037
He identified you
from mug ehots.

1084
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:54,432
He aleo said you and Mrs
Dickineon seemed close.

1085
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,590
Is that true?

1086
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:01,754
Well, sir, you might eay
we had a meeting of the minds.

1087
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,551
Are you aware they are wanted
in connection with a murder?

1088
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,359
Murder? What, Thelma? Damn!

1089
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:14,433
Did they indicate
they were running from the law?

1090
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,479
Now that you mention it,
they seemed jumpy.

1091
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,391
You know what?

1092
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,436
What?

1093
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,637
- You're irritating me.
- Me, too.

1094
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:29,793
That will happen. You two boye
have a lot in common.

1095
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,030
Maybe I ehould leave the room.

1096
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,396
I got a better idea.

1097
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,599
Mind if I speak to him alone?

1098
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,793
What did I do?
Nothing, that's what.

1099
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:06,158
This ie a crock of shit,
Mr Johnny-fucking-law.

1100
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,957
Son, I got a feeling
about something.

1101
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,270
- Yeah?
- I want your opinion.

1102
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,196
Do you think Thelma would have
committed armed robbery

1103
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,350
if you hadn't taken their money?

1104
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,350
Get your foot off that table.

1105
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,508
Cat got your tongue?

1106
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,149
No. How do you know I took it?

1107
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,912
How do you know...

1108
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,635
Don't fucking lie to me!

1109
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,713
There's two girls out there
that had a chance.

1110
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,396
You've ecrewed it up for them.
They're in serious trouble.

1111
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,678
I'll hold you responsible
if anything happens to them.

1112
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,274
I got no feeling for you.

1113
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,272
You'll either tell me
everything you know

1114
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,158
so there's a chance
I can help them,

1115
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:10,711
or I'll be all over you
like a fly on ehit.

1116

I want a word with you.

I juet told him,
if he ever got to Mexico,

he should look us up.

1178

not tell anybody.

01:55:19,876 --> 01:55:23,186
This ie just your firet chance
to express yourself.

1548
01:55:28,356 --> 01:55:29,869
Good driving.

1549
01:55:32,076 --> 01:55:33,668
Thanke.

1550
01:56:43,156 --> 01:56:47,308
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell is this?

1551
01:56:47,396 --> 01:56:49,705
I don't know.

1552
01:56:49,796 --> 01:56:53,266
I think it's the
goddamn Grand Canyon.

1553
01:56:54,436 --> 01:56:56,904
Isn't it beautiful?

1554
01:56:57,836 --> 01:57:00,873
Yeah. It's eomething
else, all right.

1555
01:58:03,092 --> 01:58:06,687
Oh, my God.
It looke like the army.

1556
01:58:06,772 --> 01:58:08,330
All this for ue?

1557
01:58:08,412 --> 01:58:11,484
Don't let them
shoot those girls.

1558
01:58:11,572 --> 01:58:13,688
This ie too much.

1559
01:58:13,772 --> 01:58:16,047
These women are armed, Hal.

1560
01:58:16,132 --> 01:58:19,044
These boys know
what they're doing.

1561
01:58:20,092 --> 01:58:22,560
Place your hands in plain view.

1562
01:58:22,652 --> 01:58:25,291
Failure to obey that command

1563
01:58:25,372 --> 01:58:29,285
will be considered an act
of aggreseion against us.

1564
01:58:30,932 --> 01:58:32,650
I repeat -

1565
01:58:32,732 --> 01:58:35,041
turn your engine off.

1566
01:58:35,132 --> 01:58:37,600
Place your hands in plain view.

1567
01:58:41,572 --> 01:58:45,451
- What are you doing?
- I'm not giving up.

1568
01:58:45,532 --> 01:58:47,523
You've got to do something.

1569
01:58:47,612 --> 01:58:50,922
How many times
muet they be fucked over?

1570
01:58:51,012 --> 01:58:53,765
Pull yourself together.

1571
01:58:53,852 --> 01:58:56,730
Don't make me
sorry I brought you!

1572
01:58:56,812 --> 01:58:58,643
Damn it!

1573
01:58:59,892 --> 01:59:04,283
Cut your engine off and place
your hands in plain view.

1574
01:59:09,972 --> 01:59:13,328
OK, then, listen.
Let'e not get caught.

1575
01:59:13,412 --> 01:59:16,085
What are you talking about?

1576
01:59:18,172 --> 01:59:20,163
Let's keep going.

1577
01:59:20,252 --> 01:59:22,561
What do you mean?

1578
01:59:25,932 --> 01:59:27,570
Go.

1579
01:59:32,412 --> 01:59:34,130
You sure?

1580
01:59:37,012 --> 01:59:39,890
Yeah. Hit it.

1581
01:59:54,972 --> 01:59:56,405
Hey!

1582
02:01:18,868 --> 02:01:24,022
<i>I felt it when the sun</i>
<i>came up this morning</i>

1583
02:01:25,988 --> 02:01:31,506
<i>I knew I could not wait</i>
<i>another day</i>

1584
02:01:33,668 --> 02:01:38,617
<i>Darling, there is something</i>
<i>I must tell you</i>

1585
02:01:40,748 --> 02:01:45,617
<i>Distant voices calling me away</i>

1586
02:01:47,908 --> 02:01:52,982
<i>Until we find the bridge</i>
<i>across forever</i>

1587
02:01:54,668 --> 02:02:00,106
<i>Until this grand illusion</i>
<i>brings us home</i>

1588
02:02:02,068 --> 02:02:07,700
<i>You and I will</i>
<i>always be together</i>

1589
02:02:09,668 --> 02:02:14,458
<i>From this day on,</i>
<i>you'll never walk alone</i>

1590
02:02:16,988 --> 02:02:19,661
<i>You're a part of me</i>

1591
02:02:19,748 --> 02:02:23,218
<i>I'm a part of you</i>

1592
02:02:24,388 --> 02:02:27,266
<i>Wherever we may travel</i>

1593
02:02:27,348 --> 02:02:30,658
<i>Whatever we go through</i>

1594
02:02:30,828 --> 02:02:34,946
<i>Whatever time may take away</i>

1595
02:02:35,028 --> 02:02:38,657
<i>It cannot change</i>
<i>the way we feel today</i>

1596
02:02:38,748 --> 02:02:43,424
<i>So hold me close,</i>
<i>and say you feel it, too</i>

1597
02:02:45,628 --> 02:02:47,778
<i>You're part of me</i>

1598
02:02:47,868 --> 02:02:50,177
<i>And I am part of you</i>

1599
02:02:56,068 --> 02:03:01,665
<i>I can hear it</i>
<i>when I stand beside the river</i>

1600
02:03:03,428 --> 02:03:08,661
<i>I can see it</i>
<i>when I look up in the sky</i>

1601
02:03:10,188 --> 02:03:16,707
<i>I can feel it when I hear</i>
<i>that lonesome highway</i>

1602
02:03:18,548 --> 02:03:23,224
<i>So many miles to go</i>
<i>before I die</i>

1603
02:03:25,668 --> 02:03:30,662
<i>We can never know</i>
<i>about tomorrow</i>

1604
02:03:32,868 --> 02:03:37,623
<i>Still we have to choose</i>
<i>which way to go</i>

1605
02:03:40,188 --> 02:03:45,216
<i>You and I are standing</i>
<i>at the crossroads</i>

1606
02:03:47,468 --> 02:03:52,781
<i>Darling, there is one thing</i>
<i>you should know</i>

1607
02:03:54,148 --> 02:03:57,060
<i>You're a part of me</i>

1608
02:03:57,148 --> 02:04:00,618
<i>I'm a part of you...</i>

1609
02:04:01,348 --> 02:04:07,139
