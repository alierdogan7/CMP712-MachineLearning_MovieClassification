00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:32,228
MAN: You know that orange juice
you have every morning?

2
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,493
You know what's in that?

3
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:34,959
Corn.

4
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:37,799
And you know what's in the maple syrup
on your pancakes?

5
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:39,804
You know what makes it taste so good?

6
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:42,341
Corn. When you're good
and help with the trash...

7
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:45,605
...you know what makes the big,
green bags biodegradable?

8
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:46,907
Do you?

9
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:48,709
Uh-huh. Corn.

10
00:02:48,884 --> 00:02:50,579
Corn starch.

11
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,550
But Daddy's company didn't come up
with that one. DuPont did.

12
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:02,088
MARK: Porsche or Porsche?
I've heard it both ways.

13
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:05,256
Three years in Germany, I should know.
What's German for "corn"?

14
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:08,426
The German word I really like is
kugelschreiber. That's "pen."

15
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:10,730
All those syllables just for "pen."

16
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:18,109
Archer Daniels Midland.
Most people have never heard of us.

17
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,840
Chances are, they've never
had a meal we're not part of.

18
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:22,643
Just read the side of the package.

19
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:26,049
That's us. Now ADM
is taking the dextrose from the corn...

20
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:29,987
...and turning it into an amino acid
called lysine. It's all very scientific.

21
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:31,352
If you're a stockholder...

22
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:34,984
...all that matters is corn goes in one end
and profit comes out the other.

23
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:38,394
We have the largest lysine plant
in the world. That's where I come in.

24
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,034
- Hey, Kirk.
- Mark.

25
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:42,693
- When are we gonna hit some balls?
- Anytime.

26
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:45,999
What do they pay Kirk?
What does a guy like that get?

27
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,869
I bet he gets a hundred grand.

28
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:51,240
He's just gonna sit behind that desk
and ride it into the future.

29
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:53,005
Good morgen.

30
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:03,056
- Morning, Mark.
- Morning.

31
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:04,920
They have lysine results.

32
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,909
Great.

33
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:28,544
MAN: We adjusted the dextrose levels
again, but the virus keeps showing up.

34
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:32,949
I thought we had it surrounded this time.
We started a new set of cultures.

35
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:37,022
MARK: We'll get it.
We just have to stay after it.

36
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,717
The things eat sugar
and that's what we're giving them.

37
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:42,762
A warm place filled with sugar.

38
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:48,962
The fucking thing is supposed to
produce 113,000 tons annually.

39
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,105
We're not gonna get anywhere
close to that.

40
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:54,800
We've got over $ 150 million in
costs over there, guys.

41
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:56,967
WILSON:
Do the Japanese have these problems?

42
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:59,545
I don't give a shit about the Japanese.

43
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:01,682
You've gotta get
the goddamn lysine bugs...

44
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,512
...to eat some dextrose
and shit us out some money.

45
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:06,313
We're having problems with this virus.

46
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:08,319
ANDREAS:
I don't want to hear about the virus.

47
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,355
How much are we losing a month?

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,724
We are down like seven million per.

49
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,158
That's not gonna fly much longer.

50
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:22,531
You want to go in next month, tell my
father we're sucking the hind tit on this?

51
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:24,001
I sure don't.

52
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:28,108
We're number 44 on the Fortune 500 list,
Mark.

53
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:31,871
I don't want this turning us
into number 45.

54
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:33,344
Fix it.

00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:38,880
MARK: Feed a chicken corn and it gets sick,
like what happened to the first settlers.

56
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:41,284
Pellagra disease. Niacin deficiency.

57
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:44,755
Gave them all sorts of problems:
Dermatitis, ataxia, even dementia.

58
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:48,384
Feed a chicken corn and lysine and
it goes from egg to supermarket fryer...

59
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:50,463
...in six months instead of eight.

60

Hey, you look great.

63
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,172
Oh.

64
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:04,673
They got the first wall of the stables
up today. See that?

65
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:07,246
You know they're doing a new thing
in hydroponics?

66
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:10,907
They're now feeding lysine
to the jumbo shrimp.

67
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:12,510
Can you imagine that?

68
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:15,656
You're a jumbo shrimp
and one day some corn goes floating by.

69
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:18,019
What do you think about that?

70
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,319
Weird, right?

71
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:21,428
There's an opening
in the plant in Mexico.

72
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:24,064
They might need me to go down
and set some stuff up.

73
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:25,927
What do you think about Mexico?

74
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,693
I thought we were getting horses.

75
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,269
Toro.

76
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,340
That's what Spanish bullfighters say.

77
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,376
But it's also what the Japanese call
the high-end tuna sushi.

78
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,775
Toro. Raw fish.

79
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:42,746
Who went first on that one?
The guy without the grill.

80
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,385
I've been to Tokyo.
They sell little-girl underwear...

81
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:49,353
...in the vending machines right
on the main drag, the Ginza, or whatever.

82
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:54,518
Guys in suits buying used girl panties.
How is that okay? That's not okay.

83
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:57,121
Yeah.

84
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:00,530
LIZ: There's a Mr. Nakawara calling
from the Ajinomoto Corporation.

85
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:03,967
He says you know him
and he needs to speak with you.

86
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,163
Yeah, put him through.

87
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,504
MARK: It's the Japanese. There's this guy,
Nakawara. He works at Ajinomoto.

88
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:11,669
He was here a couple weeks ago.
You met him.

89
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:14,610
I've been talking to him at work,
but sometimes from home...

90
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:16,751
...because of the time difference.

91
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,480
Mick, this guy knew everything.
Everything.

92
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:25,558
He says to me, "Hey, you know that total
nightmare you guys had May, June, July?"

93
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,093
Before I ask him what he's talking about,
he goes:

94
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:33,758
"Those months when ADM was losing
$ 7 million a month in the lysine business."

95
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,300
Mick, I couldn't believe it.

96
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,735
He goes on to tell me
that one of our highest-paid employees...

97
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:44,004
...is actually an employee of Ajinomoto,
who is sabotaging the plant.

98
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:48,775
They're injecting a virus into the dextrose
and contaminating the whole deal.

99
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,511
That's the problem.

100
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,983
I'm telling you, Mick, it's like Rising Sun.

101
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:55,679
It's like the Crichton novel.
It's just like that.

102
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:58,291
I go, "Why are you talking to me?"
Know what he says?

103
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,189
Yeah, I know what he says.

104
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:02,993
How much does he want?

105
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,263
Ten million dollars.

106
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:10,835
Ten million, but that gives you
the identity of the saboteur...

107
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:14,497
...the secret identity, and a new lysine bug
that is immune to the virus.

108
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:17,440
We have the plant up and running
in three days.

109
00:08:17,612 --> 00:08:19,409
How well do you know this guy?

110
00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:21,475
[SIGHS]

111
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:25,312
I met him when he was here. We've
spoken on the phone half a dozen times.

112
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:26,852
So not very well.

113
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:31,289
Very well? No, I wouldn't say that.

114
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:35,088
If you hear from him again,
talk him down on the price.

115
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:37,697
Find out the least amount of money
he'd settle for.

116
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:43,498
I mean, if we can get a bug that's resistant
to the virus, this might be worth it.

117
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:44,865
But keep this secret.

118
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,304
If there is a mole, I don't want him to know
that we're on to him.

119
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:49,636
Absolutely.

Famous name-brand labels

...at savings
of up to 50 percent every day.

124
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,888
Maybe a food court
with a Mexican place.

125
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:11,662
The birds eat the bugs, the cars eat
the birds, the rust eats the cars...

126
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,597
...and new construction eats the rust.

I've been dragging this thing along.
I think if we don't make a move...

There is a price-fixing investigation in
the cement manufacturing business there.

so we're not going there.

the size of this. That's bullshit.

Yeah.

- Will you call them, please?

00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:25,055
I will. I will. Make yourselves at home,
please. I'll call. I'll call.

846
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:31,032
Do you have a suite perhaps that's a bit
more roomy for us?

847
00:51:31,637 --> 00:51:35,698
The Makuaha Room. Yes.
Is that your biggest room? It sounds big.

Thattaboy, Mark.

860
00:52:23,389 --> 00:52:28,292
We have an old saying at ADM.
I think it applies here.

861
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,123
"It's better to have the elephants
inside the tent pissing out...

862

00:52:35,401 --> 00:52:37,392
Outside piss?

What he's saying is,
the customers are our enemy.

The competitors are our friend.

867
00:52:45,344 --> 00:52:49,781
It's important we have all the producers
involved, including the Cheil Corporation.

I want to know why we have been
excluded from association in the past.

...at agreed-upon levels?

872
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:06,957
Well, it would be our preference
that we simply trust each other.

873
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,258
And if we find out someone's
been lying...

874
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:12,893
...we'll just hire some Mafia figure
to rub you out.

That's just a little bit of levity...

that if we can't trust each other...

WILSON: I can't believe they would
pull this shit on Dwayne Andreas.

992
01:00:17,658 --> 01:00:19,592
MARK: Look, I get phone calls
from time to time.

993
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:21,353
WILSON:
I know, I know.

994
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,224
Oh, God.

995
01:00:23,398 --> 01:00:25,764
We're going to the lawyers.
I don't want phones.

996
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:27,093
See? The phones.

997
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:29,600
They hit everybody.
My dad, Schmidt, Randall.

998
01:00:29,771 --> 01:00:30,795
Oh, fuck me.

999
01:00:30,972 --> 01:00:33,167
No, they played me a tape of me.

1000
01:00:33,341 --> 01:00:36,401
Some meeting with the fucking Japanese.
I called the lawyers.

1001
01:00:36,577 --> 01:00:38,841
- We're gonna go there.
- Yeah? They played a tape.

1002
01:00:39,013 --> 01:00:42,642
- How the fuck did they get a tape?
- I really don't think they have that much.

1003
01:00:42,817 --> 01:00:45,217
When you factor in everything
we've done for them...

1004
01:00:45,386 --> 01:00:48,514
...this will be a 10-year thing
for the lawyers. Maybe a fine.

1005
01:00:48,689 --> 01:00:52,420
That's all this is ever gonna be.
Trust me.

[DOOR CLOSES]

1007
01:00:54,495 --> 01:00:55,587
- How's it going?
- Good.

1008
01:00:55,763 --> 01:00:57,526
FBI.

1009
01:00:58,466 --> 01:01:02,425
Yeah, he's here.
I got Agent Temples for Attorney Mutchnik.

1010
01:01:05,473 --> 01:01:06,667
This is James Mutchnik.

1011
01:01:06,841 --> 01:01:09,207
TEMPLES: Just interviewed
an ADM employee, Kirk Schmidt.

1012
01:01:10,078 --> 01:01:14,310
Schmidt knew we were coming.
Says he knew about the raid days ago.

1013
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:17,475
He says Whitacre told him.

1014
01:01:18,753 --> 01:01:19,879
Thanks.

1015
01:01:20,054 --> 01:01:23,455
- He sees you sitting in the window and...
- Bob. Brian.

1016
01:01:23,624 --> 01:01:25,353
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

1017
01:01:30,665 --> 01:01:33,065
That was amazing.
You guys should have seen it.

1018
01:01:33,234 --> 01:01:36,362
Oh, Terry was so scared,
and Mick and the lawyers, they were just...

1019
01:01:36,537 --> 01:01:38,266
- They were pissed.
SHEPARD: That's super.

1020
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:40,805
They thought you guys
gave me the once-over.

1021
01:01:40,975 --> 01:01:43,307
They're like, "You all right?"
I'm going, "Yeah."

1022
01:01:43,478 --> 01:01:46,572
- Did you make a tape?
- Yeah, I made a tape. A great one.

1023
01:01:46,747 --> 01:01:48,009
Really good.

1024
01:01:48,182 --> 01:01:49,979
So it's over, then.

1025
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:51,175
SHEPARD:
Mark...

1026
01:01:52,353 --> 01:01:53,650
...who did you tell?

1027
01:01:55,022 --> 01:01:58,856
- What?
- Who else did you tell about the raid?

1028
01:02:03,464 --> 01:02:05,091
Well...

1029
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,861
I had to tell my secretary.

1030
01:02:09,036 --> 01:02:12,699
Guys, I'm the head
of the bioproducts division.

1031
01:02:12,874 --> 01:02:16,207
She has to know where to get in touch
with me. I told her months ago.

1032
01:02:16,377 --> 01:02:19,938
So all I said was,
"Liz, I'm doing some work with the FBI.

1033
01:02:20,114 --> 01:02:22,139
I might be out of touch for a while."

1034
01:02:22,316 --> 01:02:26,616
That's it.
She had no idea about our case.

1035
01:02:32,827 --> 01:02:36,285
I'm pretty sure I've mentioned the name
Kathy Dougherty a time or two...

1036
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:37,761
...in my division.

1037
01:02:37,932 --> 01:02:43,427
Kathy is a friend. She is a trusted ally.

1038
01:02:43,604 --> 01:02:45,071
I didn't want her to be scared.

1039
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:48,106
Why would you do that, Mark?
Why would you tell Dougherty?

1040
01:02:48,276 --> 01:02:53,111
Because I didn't want her to be scared.
I trust her.

1041
01:02:53,281 --> 01:02:55,715
- Guys, we can trust Kathy.
- Who else?

1042
01:02:55,883 --> 01:02:58,044
Don't jack us around, Mark.

1043
01:03:01,822 --> 01:03:03,449
Mm.

1044
01:03:03,758 --> 01:03:06,886
Kirk Schmidt. I mean, Schmidty...

1045
01:03:07,061 --> 01:03:10,258
Look, I was afraid that he wouldn't
say anything to you guys.

1046
01:03:10,431 --> 01:03:12,865
That he'd clam up on account
of he's loyal to me.

1047
01:03:13,034 --> 01:03:15,502
You could have ruined
this entire operation.

1048
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:17,934
Has anything gone wrong?
Has anything gone wrong?

1049
01:03:18,105 --> 01:03:19,572
Time out. Time out. Time out.

1050
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:25,578
Mark, you know what you did,
in our eyes, was wrong.

1051
01:03:26,781 --> 01:03:31,150
- It was supposed to be a secret.
SHEPARD: Look, we can get past this.

1052
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:35,221
But is there anything else
that we need to know?

1053
01:03:35,389 --> 01:03:37,016
No.

1054
01:03:37,892 --> 01:03:39,484
No, not that I can think of.

1055
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:47,862

1056
01:03:48,035 --> 01:03:50,026
...tell them you're getting
your own lawyer.

I know about the lawyers, Brian!

1058
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:41,921
Mark Whitacre, Aubrey Daniel.

1059
01:04:42,089 --> 01:04:44,683
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm representing ADM in this matter.

1060
01:04:44,859 --> 01:04:45,917
Okay.

1061
01:04:46,093 --> 01:04:49,187
- This is John Dowd, a colleague of mine.
- Good morning, John.

1062
01:04:49,363 --> 01:04:52,958
Dwayne has filled us in
on your responsibilities here, so...

1063
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,034
Aubrey prosecuted Lieutenant Calley
after the My Lai massacre in Vietnam...

1064
01:04:57,204 --> 01:05:00,662
...so this ought to be a cakewalk
for him.

1065
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:03,105
We were hoping you'd have time
to talk to John.

1066
01:05:03,277 --> 01:05:05,745
- Sure.
- ADM's behind you on this, Mark.

1067
01:05:05,913 --> 01:05:08,609

to know...

1068
01:05:08,783 --> 01:05:11,115
...that we're gonna be paying
all your legal fees.

1069
01:05:11,285 --> 01:05:13,776
Oh, great. Great.
Thank you, that's great.

1070
01:05:13,954 --> 01:05:17,412
Then... Then we'll let you fellas
get acquainted, okay?

1071
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:18,683
Okay.

1072
01:05:20,928 --> 01:05:24,364
- How you holding up, Mark? Thanks.
- Good. Please, sit down.

1074
01:05:29,337 --> 01:05:32,238
- John, can I ask you something?
- Sure, anything.

1075
01:05:32,406 --> 01:05:36,809
If I say something to you, are you allowed
to say anything to Mick and Dwayne?

01:06:04,772 --> 01:06:06,672
Oh. Here we go.

1079
01:06:17,118 --> 01:06:21,350
MARK: I need to tell you I'm gonna
be cooperating with the FBI.

1080
01:06:21,889 --> 01:06:23,447
They have hundreds of tapes.

1081
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:26,616
They know all about lysine.

1082
01:06:27,728 --> 01:06:30,663
And John here agrees with me
I should be getting another lawyer.

1083
01:06:30,831 --> 01:06:33,459
Oh. No question about it.

1084
01:06:36,804 --> 01:06:39,170
I want to say sorry
for everything that's happened.

1085
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,637
Sorry?

1086
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:43,434
What's that?

1087
01:06:44,311 --> 01:06:46,643
It feels good to talk, to clear the air.

1088
01:06:46,814 --> 01:06:48,873
You get to be like a balloon
after a while...

1089
01:06:49,049 --> 01:06:52,883
...a balloon looking for a pin
to bump into and relieve the pressure.

1090
01:06:53,053 --> 01:06:56,489
You could get sick from keeping it inside
and get a tumor or something.

1091
01:06:56,657 --> 01:06:58,022
I didn't ask for that.

1092
01:06:58,459 --> 01:07:00,950
I have a friend from school
who has a law practice.

1093
01:07:01,128 --> 01:07:04,291
And he's always telling me
how they can't talk about their cases.

1094
01:07:04,465 --> 01:07:06,831
Like in The Firm.
You can tell them anything.

1095
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:11,165
They have to keep it to themselves or they
get in a lot of trouble. They're boxed.

1096
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:13,329
That's what they say: Boxed.

1097
01:07:13,707 --> 01:07:16,608
LAWYER: So there wasn't a saboteur
at all. You made that up?

1098
01:07:16,777 --> 01:07:19,610
MARK: Well, maybe there was.
I mean, there could have been.

1099
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,077
Okay.

1100
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:23,148
ADM steals technology
from the Japanese...

1101
01:07:23,317 --> 01:07:26,548
...so I wouldn't put it past the Japanese
to do the same thing to us.

1102
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,245
But once I told the FBI
that I'd made that part up...

1103
01:07:29,423 --> 01:07:33,757
...they said I had very little choice
but to be a cooperating witness.

1104
01:07:34,428 --> 01:07:37,920
And you began making tapes.
How many tapes did you make?

1105
01:07:38,098 --> 01:07:41,158
There are over 200 tapes.

1106
01:07:41,569 --> 01:07:43,230
Ooh.

1107
01:07:43,604 --> 01:07:47,665
There are so many really nice people
in the world, people who want to help out.

1108
01:07:47,842 --> 01:07:49,935
Good neighbors, good listeners.

1109
01:07:50,211 --> 01:07:52,179
Like when they had floods
in Mississippi...

1110
01:07:52,346 --> 01:07:55,008
...and people lose everything
and are sleeping in a gym...

1111
01:07:55,182 --> 01:07:59,482
...someone always shows up with a warm
coat and a homemade pot roast.

1112
01:07:59,653 --> 01:08:04,147
That's why Ginger and I bought that girl
a computer after she had the spine injury.

1113
01:08:04,325 --> 01:08:06,725
That kind of thing
really makes a difference.

1114
01:08:06,894 --> 01:08:08,759
Jim here strikes me as that kind of guy.

1115
01:08:08,929 --> 01:08:12,387
He's the one-in-a-hundred guy who, when
you come into the emergency room...

1116
01:08:12,566 --> 01:08:14,659
...you thank your lucky stars
it's his watch.

1117
01:08:14,835 --> 01:08:18,202
- Illegal campaign contributions,
whatever. Whatever we're talking about.

1118
01:08:18,372 --> 01:08:20,772
So then I'd come back.
Two nights a week or so...

1119
01:08:20,941 --> 01:08:23,910
...Brian and Bob and I
would get together, and we'd...

1120
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:27,445
You know, we'd work it.
We'd build the investigation.

1121
01:08:27,615 --> 01:08:30,049
Get everything we needed,
gather all the information.

1122
01:08:30,217 --> 01:08:32,276
Then we went to DOJ,
briefed those lawyers...

1123
01:08:32,453 --> 01:08:36,253
...and before you knew it, we were hitting
ADM, raiding the place, taking it down.

1124
01:08:36,423 --> 01:08:38,857
And for how long did you do this?
Work as an informant?

1125
01:08:39,026 --> 01:08:42,484
Ahh, ooh. Two and a half years.

1126
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:46,766
Two and a half years.

1127
01:08:46,934 --> 01:08:48,629
You know, and I always thought...

1128
01:08:48,802 --> 01:08:52,169
...there'd still be a place for me at ADM
when this whole thing was over.

1129
01:08:52,339 --> 01:08:54,534
I still have a lot of friends there.

1130
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,732
A lot of friends.

1131
01:08:58,846 --> 01:09:00,507
Hey, Mark...

1132
01:09:01,115 --> 01:09:04,915
...it's very important to your case you
not discuss this with anyone else. Okay?

1133
01:09:05,519 --> 01:09:10,081
These people you work with, your friends,
they could end up being witnesses.

1134
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:14,125
Bob and I are the only people
you talk to about this from now on.

1135
01:09:14,461 --> 01:09:17,589
All right? And I want you to know
that you can tell us anything.

1136
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,289
- Okay. Yeah.
EPSTEIN: Okay?

1137
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:24,631
Well, they kept coming to the house
and they only had ADM's side of the story.

1138
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:27,397
SHEPARD [OVER PHONE]: Did you
talk to The Wall Street Journal, Mark?

1139
01:09:27,575 --> 01:09:30,874
What did you say? It's real important
that you not talk to the press.

1140
01:09:31,145 --> 01:09:34,308
Me? I told them I had no comment,
but it didn't matter.

1141
01:09:34,481 --> 01:09:37,541
They had the story anyway.
They already had it.

1142
01:09:39,186 --> 01:09:42,644
Did you see my stipple portrait?
It's pretty good.

1143
01:09:48,796 --> 01:09:50,525
EPSTEIN:
Oh, shit.

1144
01:09:57,338 --> 01:10:00,865
MAN 1: I'd appreciate any comment you
can make on the allegations on the TV.

1145
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:03,373
Just a quick comment.
What do you have to say?

1146
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:08,641
I came out to tell you that I'm not allowed
to talk to the press at this time.

1147
01:10:08,816 --> 01:10:11,250
WOMAN: At least any comment
on the effects of your actions...

1148
01:10:11,418 --> 01:10:13,249
...on ADM's declining stock prices?

1149
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,548
What's been the reaction
of your friends being taped?

1150
01:10:16,724 --> 01:10:19,852
Well, I'm a person of interest in an

Neither he nor his company

...driven by his own boundless ambition
to take over ADM...

1240

...has attempted
to frame his superiors...

His cooperation with the government...

1243
01:16:35,602 --> 01:16:39,402
...merely a smokescreen
to hide his lying, cheating and stealing.

to Grand Cayman...

01:17:04,297 --> 01:17:06,822
...to the FBI
and the United States government.

1253
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,731
They're saying he stole two and a half
million dollars while we were running him.

1254
01:17:10,904 --> 01:17:14,271
But how could we know what he
was doing? He came to us.

1255
01:17:14,441 --> 01:17:17,308
The question they're asking isn't
"How could we know?"

1256
01:17:17,477 --> 01:17:18,876
It's "Why didn't we know?"

1257
01:17:19,046 --> 01:17:22,413
No. The question is,
"Were they price fixing?"

1258

The investigation has shifted
from ADM to Whitacre.

1259

Clearly, he made mistakes,
but he made your case.

We are not here to discuss the case

1287
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,284
Mr. Whitacre, my name is Ed Herbst...

1288
01:19:09,456 --> 01:19:12,619
...and I am with the FBI's
Economic Crimes Unit.

1289
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:14,760
This is Mary Spearing
and Don McKay...

1290
01:19:14,928 --> 01:19:17,328
...from the Department
of Justice Fraud Division.

1291
01:19:17,497 --> 01:19:19,965
And we were wondering
if you could tell us...

1292
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:23,728
...when your criminal conduct
at ADM began.

1293
01:19:24,538 --> 01:19:27,666
In early 1992...

1294
01:19:28,675 --> 01:19:33,271
...I was taught how things are done
there by Mick Andreas...

1295
01:19:34,181 --> 01:19:36,979
...who showed me
how to use embezzlements...

1296
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:40,483
...and kickbacks
in order to make money tax-free.

1297
01:19:40,654 --> 01:19:41,951
My client is voluntarily...

1298
01:19:42,122 --> 01:19:46,058
No, I'm aware that the fraud
that I perpetrated...

1299
01:19:46,226 --> 01:19:48,456
...was wrong and...

1300
01:19:48,628 --> 01:19:50,323
...I accept responsibility.

1301
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:52,593
How did you receive the money?

1302
01:19:52,766 --> 01:19:56,429
By check. They would deposit the check
to my account in Decatur.

1303
01:19:56,603 --> 01:19:59,299
They paid kickbacks in checks?

1304
01:19:59,773 --> 01:20:01,741
What company would pay kickbacks
in checks?

1305
01:20:01,908 --> 01:20:04,035
Well, I don't remember the name
of the company.

1306
01:20:04,211 --> 01:20:08,739
It was, like, Agra Consulting and Trading
or something like that.

1307
01:20:08,915 --> 01:20:11,475
You don't remember the company
that paid you checks?

1308
01:20:11,651 --> 01:20:13,881
It's hard to remember for me right now.

1309
01:20:14,054 --> 01:20:17,512

in case you haven't been reading papers.

01:20:17,691 --> 01:20:21,684
We're coming to you. We're cooperating.
We're gonna get the money back.

1311
01:20:21,861 --> 01:20:25,820
I think this might help your memory.

1312
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:32,030
Now, where did we get those?

1313
01:20:32,205 --> 01:20:36,539
These are ADM documents
showing forging of signatures.

1314

[GROANS]

1315
01:20:37,944 --> 01:20:41,072
MARK: Didn't these people see The Firm?
Or read the book?

1316
01:20:41,248 --> 01:20:45,014
It's all there. Everything they did to me,
they did to Tom Cruise.

1317
01:20:45,185 --> 01:20:47,551
I'm not the one they should be mad at.

1318
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:49,586
HERNDON:
We can't see you anymore.

1319
01:20:49,756 --> 01:20:55,558
And if you call us and start to talk
about the case, we'll have to hang up.

1320
01:20:55,729 --> 01:20:59,062
You can talk to us about your feelings...

1321
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:01,091
...but that's it.

1322
01:21:02,969 --> 01:21:05,665
Mark, please understand.

1323
01:21:06,573 --> 01:21:10,441
It's not what we want.
We got no choice here.

1324
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:15,206
You know, the thing of it is,
all of my anger, all of my frustration...

1325
01:21:15,382 --> 01:21:18,351
...stems from my work with you guys.

1326
01:21:18,518 --> 01:21:20,577
And all this crap in the paper...

1327
01:21:22,389 --> 01:21:24,323
My kids are seeing this.

1328
01:21:25,692 --> 01:21:27,887
And it's all just dump on Mark Whitacre.

1329
01:21:28,428 --> 01:21:33,058
Remember, Mark, we told you
it would be impossible to predict...

1330
01:21:33,233 --> 01:21:35,599
...what would happen
when the case went public.

1331
01:21:36,369 --> 01:21:38,599
You never told us
about the $5 million you took.

1332
01:21:38,772 --> 01:21:41,240
I don't see what that has to do
with the price fixing.

1333
01:21:41,408 --> 01:21:44,036
He worked for you
for two and a half years.

1334
01:21:44,277 --> 01:21:47,041
He risked his career, his home...

1335
01:21:47,947 --> 01:21:53,146
...and now you just turn your back on him
and leave us out here.

1336
01:21:53,787 --> 01:21:54,947
Yes, Ginger.

1337
01:21:55,121 --> 01:21:57,681
SHEPARD:
The reason we came here today...

1338
01:21:59,059 --> 01:22:03,291
...is because we're concerned
about your and Mark's well-being.

1339
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:09,793
It's important you tell the people
in Washington everything tomorrow.

1340
01:22:09,969 --> 01:22:11,561
One hundred percent.

1341
01:22:11,738 --> 01:22:15,936
You would have nothing without him,
and you know it.

1342
01:22:16,876 --> 01:22:19,344
He's being used by the government,
then thrown away...

1343
01:22:19,512 --> 01:22:23,778
...because it's easier to go after Mark
Whitacre than anyone named Andreas.

1344
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:30,050
MARK: We took the kids one year
to the Renaissance festival.

1345
01:22:30,223 --> 01:22:31,690
You get to be the white knight.

1346
01:22:31,858 --> 01:22:35,419
The kids get to ride a horse and joust
against the forces of darkness.

1347
01:22:35,595 --> 01:22:39,258
The white knight always wins. The forces
of darkness fall onto an old mattress.

1348
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:42,959
Someone plays a lute
and plays a song from medieval times.

1349
01:22:43,136 --> 01:22:46,071
It was 90 degrees,
and the heat and humidity index...

1350
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,400
...I can't even remember
what the radio said.

1351
01:22:48,575 --> 01:22:52,011
We were next in line and the mare
collapsed, went down in a heap.

1352
01:22:52,178 --> 01:22:56,080
Ginger was eating Ye Olde Drumstick
and she dropped it. The kids were crying.

1353
01:22:56,249 --> 01:23:00,117
And I remember this farmer saying
he had a gun in his truck. Just like that.

1354
01:23:00,286 --> 01:23:02,720
From the white knight
to a gun in the truck.

1355
01:23:02,889 --> 01:23:05,357
They had everyone turn
before they put the animal down.

1356
01:23:05,525 --> 01:23:08,358
But even if you couldn't see,
you could still hear.

1357
01:23:08,528 --> 01:23:10,462
How do you get that back?

1358
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,655
How does that get to be fair?

1359
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,194
GINGER:
Well, he just kept buying things.

1360
01:23:17,003 --> 01:23:19,028
We had eight cars.

1361
01:23:20,006 --> 01:23:22,531
Three of them we never even used.

1362
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,273
And how else has he changed?

1363
01:23:28,581 --> 01:23:31,709
Well, I was always the one
with the temper.

1364
01:23:31,885 --> 01:23:36,117
- Mm-hm.
- And Corky was the happy one.

1365
01:23:36,289 --> 01:23:37,847
But that's changed too.

1366
01:23:38,024 --> 01:23:41,323
- There's one in Hong Kong.
MILLER: Mm-hm.

1367
01:23:41,494 --> 01:23:44,292
Then there are the accounts
in Switzerland and Grand Cayman.

1368
01:23:44,464 --> 01:23:45,931
Right, right.

1369
01:23:46,099 --> 01:23:50,160
Other things. There's a lawyer in New
York who's got a million dollars of mine.

1370
01:23:50,336 --> 01:23:52,566
Have you told your attorney
about these?

1371
01:23:52,739 --> 01:23:55,299
No, I don't need to tell...

1372
01:23:57,410 --> 01:24:00,573
Mark, you need to tell your attorney
about these accounts.

1373
01:24:00,747 --> 01:24:04,478
The assets were obtained legally.
I don't even know if I can trust him.

1374
01:24:04,651 --> 01:24:08,246
Has anyone in your family ever
been diagnosed with bipolar disorder?

1375
01:24:08,421 --> 01:24:10,514
You know, manic depressive?

1376
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:17,027
I have an aunt
that they used to say that about.

1377
01:24:17,197 --> 01:24:18,687
Yeah?

1378
01:24:19,432 --> 01:24:21,764
In terms of my parents, I can't be sure.

1379
01:24:21,935 --> 01:24:25,427
My parents died in an automobile accident
when I was 6.

1380
01:24:25,605 --> 01:24:29,803
I was adopted by a wealthy man in Ohio.
He owned amusement parks.

1381
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:32,744
I caught a big break there, big break.

1382
01:24:33,346 --> 01:24:35,541
So my client's here to cooperate fully.

1383
01:24:35,715 --> 01:24:38,183
Agent D'Angelo,
if you have any questions.

1384
01:24:39,185 --> 01:24:42,177
This is your chance to put everything
on the table.

1385
01:24:42,422 --> 01:24:44,413
This is your chance to redeem yourself.

1386
01:24:44,591 --> 01:24:48,857
But if you're not going to be completely
honest, just stop talking now.

1387
01:24:49,696 --> 01:24:51,755
I understand that.

1388
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:55,725
I just want to tell you I feel...

1389
01:24:56,803 --> 01:24:59,135
...bad. I'm so sorry.

1390
01:25:01,508 --> 01:25:04,705
The last time we spoke,
I was under a great deal of stress.

1391
01:25:04,878 --> 01:25:07,346
And I said some things
that weren't true.

1392
01:25:09,282 --> 01:25:10,977
I want to clear that up.

1393
01:25:12,452 --> 01:25:16,183
The first kickback was in 1992.

1394
01:25:16,356 --> 01:25:18,620
Mick knew all about it.

1395
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:21,817
He told me there were gonna
be opportunities to take kickbacks...

1396
01:25:21,995 --> 01:25:24,828
...on some of the contracts coming out
of Asia and Europe...

1397
01:25:24,998 --> 01:25:27,398
...that were ADM contracts.

1398
01:25:29,569 --> 01:25:31,560
Was there anyone else involved?

1399
01:25:33,573 --> 01:25:36,736
BASSET:
So, Mr. Richter, we have...

1400
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:41,973
...money leaving your account
here and here...

1401
01:25:42,148 --> 01:25:43,809
...and here.

1402
01:25:43,983 --> 01:25:48,579
And it's going into Whitacre's account...

1403
01:25:48,755 --> 01:25:51,349
...his wife Ginger's account...

1404
01:25:51,524 --> 01:25:54,357
...and this is going
to Whitacre's parents' account.

1405
01:25:55,428 --> 01:25:57,953
Like I said, those are loans.

1406
01:25:58,598 --> 01:25:59,758
Uh-huh.

1407
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,427
He had me set up a company,
Nordkron Chemie...

1408
01:26:04,604 --> 01:26:09,007
...and just, like, issue
these fake invoices to ADM.

1409
01:26:09,175 --> 01:26:11,666
And there was a bank account
in Hamburg...

1410
01:26:12,779 --> 01:26:16,215
...and so I would get a check
for like two hundred grand...

1411
01:26:16,382 --> 01:26:18,942
...and most of it would go back to Mark.

1412
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:22,544
Ahem. Okay, look.

1413
01:26:23,923 --> 01:26:26,858
We know you're looking out
for your friend Mark...

1414
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,728
...but your story doesn't seem true.

1415
01:26:32,799 --> 01:26:35,267
You're right, it's not true.

1416
01:26:35,435 --> 01:26:37,198
All the money went to Mark.

1417
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:39,270
When did it start?

1418
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:43,034
Mark told me about this Nigerian thing
he got in the mail.

1419
01:26:43,576 --> 01:26:47,012
You know about these schemes
with the Nigerian letters?

1420
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:50,081
The 419 fraud?
Yeah, we see it every day.

1421
01:26:50,249 --> 01:26:54,709
You get a letter from some official
in Nigeria asking for a few grand to help.

1422
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:57,913
- They promise a percentage of the money.
- Exactly.

1423
01:26:58,458 --> 01:27:02,360
You ever wonder who was dumb enough
to fall for something like that?

1424
01:27:05,198 --> 01:27:07,359
This is really embarrassing.

1425
01:27:09,002 --> 01:27:12,836
So how much money would you say
you made from your illegal activities?

1426
01:27:15,174 --> 01:27:17,267
Uh...

1427
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,878
Seven-point-seven million dollars.

1428
01:27:25,685 --> 01:27:28,654
But like I said, Mick knew all about that,
you know?

1429
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:30,755
He endorsed that kind of behavior.

1430
01:27:32,091 --> 01:27:35,060
So not five, but seven-point-seven?

1431
01:27:35,228 --> 01:27:36,422
Seven-point-seven.

1432
01:27:36,596 --> 01:27:40,862
Jim, we all understand special
consideration, but we've got your guy.

1433
01:27:41,034 --> 01:27:44,026
And these are cases we know
we can convict.

1434
01:27:44,203 --> 01:27:47,263
Forty-five counts of wire fraud...

1435
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,102
...and money laundering
and tax evasion.

1436
01:27:50,276 --> 01:27:53,074
So explain to us,
where is the wiggle room?

1437
01:27:53,246 --> 01:27:58,445
I'm not stupid. Mark committed a crime.
He stole nine million dollars.

1438
01:27:58,918 --> 01:28:00,442
That's pretty indefensible.

1439
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:04,056
But these guys at ADM, they stole
hundreds of millions of dollars...

1440
01:28:04,223 --> 01:28:06,418
...from innocent people
all around the world.

1441
01:28:06,592 --> 01:28:09,527
Mark showed that white guys in suits
getting together...

1442
01:28:09,696 --> 01:28:11,823
...that's not a meeting,
it's a crime scene.

1443
01:28:11,998 --> 01:28:15,991
And not only did he tell you about it,
he got the evidence to prove it. Ha.

1444
01:28:16,169 --> 01:28:20,629
When agents go undercover for the FBI,
they get trained for the stresses.

1445
01:28:20,873 --> 01:28:24,570
We hear this all the time.
How easy it is for a trained agent to crack.

1446
01:28:24,744 --> 01:28:29,147
I mean, here's Mark, a civilian,
with no training.

1447
01:28:29,882 --> 01:28:31,747
But you guys just shove him in there.

1448
01:28:31,918 --> 01:28:36,412
You tell him to go for it without any
training to make sure he doesn't crack.

1449
01:28:49,302 --> 01:28:50,496
Ah! Baby.

1450
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:52,763
[GRUNTING]

1451
01:28:52,939 --> 01:28:54,497
Ginger.

1452
01:28:58,311 --> 01:28:59,869
Ginger.

1453
01:29:02,915 --> 01:29:04,109
They kidnapped me.

1454
01:29:04,283 --> 01:29:06,979
They put me in a car.
They drove me around for 20 minutes.

1455
01:29:07,153 --> 01:29:08,984
- They wouldn't let me out.
- Oh, my gosh.

1456
01:29:09,155 --> 01:29:11,248
- My leg.
- Oh, Mark.

1457
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,358
It's all cramped.

1458
01:29:13,826 --> 01:29:15,350
Who did this? Who took you?

1459
01:29:15,528 --> 01:29:20,192
It's obvious. Look at my jacket.
These people mean business.

1460
01:29:20,767 --> 01:29:21,961
MARK:
I was abducted.

1461
01:29:22,135 --> 01:29:26,799
I was thrown into the back
of a light-brown Dodge Dynasty...

1462
01:29:26,973 --> 01:29:29,703
...by two thugs...

1463
01:29:29,876 --> 01:29:33,505
...and driven around
in a 20-minute joyride.

1464
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:36,478
And basically, I was told...

1465
01:29:36,649 --> 01:29:39,777
...you know, forget everything
that isn't on tape...

1466
01:29:39,952 --> 01:29:45,322
...and you can forget about bringing it up
in a courtroom or for the media.

1467
01:29:45,491 --> 01:29:47,686
Did the men identify themselves?

1468
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:50,328
I think we know who sent them.

1469
01:29:50,496 --> 01:29:54,762
GINGER: And they sawed the locks
off the door, like Mafia thugs.

1470
01:29:54,934 --> 01:29:57,926
Yeah, on each side, so I was trapped.

1471
01:29:58,104 --> 01:30:01,403
NEWSMAN: You were trapped.
You couldn't roll down the window.

1472
01:30:01,707 --> 01:30:03,106
MARK:
No.

1473
01:30:03,543 --> 01:30:06,034
NEWSMAN:
Where was the FBI in all of this?

1474
01:30:06,712 --> 01:30:10,239
GINGER: Well, I think...
We think people have to realize...

1475
01:30:10,416 --> 01:30:14,045
...that the FBI did the same thing.

1476
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:17,212
I mean, they locked my husband
in an investigation...

1477
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:20,723
...and they drove our family around
for three years.

1478
01:30:20,893 --> 01:30:23,726
- Three to five years?
- Yes.

1479
01:30:23,896 --> 01:30:27,730
In jail? But ADM's the bad guys.

1480
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:32,633
Everywhere we go, it's the same story.
It's just dump on Mark Whitacre.

1481
01:30:32,805 --> 01:30:34,238
You gotta focus here.

1482
01:30:34,407 --> 01:30:38,366
You stole $9 million,
and then you lied about it.

1483
01:30:38,945 --> 01:30:40,469
Maybe in your head, you're good.

1484
01:30:40,646 --> 01:30:44,104
To them, you're a guy who stole a lot
of money, and then lied about it.

1485
01:30:44,851 --> 01:30:47,843
Ginger and I have been talking
and we'd like to file a lawsuit...

1486
01:30:48,087 --> 01:30:50,885
...against Brian Shepard
and the United States government.

1487
01:30:51,057 --> 01:30:53,548
Oh, my God. For what, Mark?

1488
01:30:53,726 --> 01:30:55,455
He hit me with a briefcase.

1489
01:30:58,231 --> 01:30:59,255
Mark, come on.

1490
01:31:01,534 --> 01:31:05,402
And he told me to destroy tapes
that didn't help the case.

1491
01:31:05,571 --> 01:31:07,038
Why would Brian Shepard do that?

1492
01:31:07,206 --> 01:31:11,609
Maybe the question you should be asking
yourself is, what is Brian Shepard hiding?

1493
01:31:12,612 --> 01:31:15,274
All right. I'm telling you, okay?

1494
01:31:15,448 --> 01:31:17,348
Take the plea.

1495
01:31:18,284 --> 01:31:19,649
[SCOFFS]

1496
01:31:22,288 --> 01:31:24,620
Thanks, Jim, but...

1497
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:26,917
...we're gonna go a different way.

1498
01:31:30,062 --> 01:31:31,586
MAN: Evelyn?
EVELYN: What?

1499
01:31:31,764 --> 01:31:34,892
MAN: There's a reporter
from the Washington Post.

1500
01:31:35,067 --> 01:31:37,194
Has some questions about Corky.

1501
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:39,665
A reporter.

1502
01:31:42,308 --> 01:31:44,299
EVELYN:
This is Evelyn Whitacre.

1503
01:31:46,279 --> 01:31:48,543
What do you mean, adopted?

1504
01:31:49,048 --> 01:31:53,212
Well, as his mother, I can assure you...

1505
01:31:53,386 --> 01:31:57,880
...that my husband and I
were not killed in a car accident...

1506
01:31:58,057 --> 01:32:01,424
...and Mark was not adopted
by wealthy people.

1507
01:32:06,666 --> 01:32:11,569
Mark's been telling people that you
and I were killed in a car accident...

1508
01:32:11,737 --> 01:32:14,831
...and he was adopted by rich people.

1509
01:32:15,608 --> 01:32:17,166
What do you make of that?

1510
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,773
That's kind of weird.

1511
01:32:23,849 --> 01:32:27,512
MARK: I read this study in TIME magazine
when I was at Cornell.

1512
01:32:27,687 --> 01:32:30,315
There were people who never believed
I would make it...

1513
01:32:30,489 --> 01:32:32,548
...into an Ivy League school.
Maybe Ginger...

1514
01:32:32,725 --> 01:32:34,522
...who I met in the 8th grade.

1515
01:32:34,694 --> 01:32:37,754
And the study said that people
had nice, sympathetic feelings...

1516
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:40,763
...about people who were adopted,
and treated them better.

1517
01:32:40,933 --> 01:32:43,868
So I made up this adoption story
and people did treat me better.

1518
01:32:44,036 --> 01:32:47,301
When I got a job, one of my professors
told people at Ralston Purina...

1519
01:32:47,473 --> 01:32:51,170
...I was this guy that had accomplished
all of this in spite of being adopted.

1520
01:32:51,344 --> 01:32:54,074
So it was really other people
who spread the story, not me.

1521
01:32:54,246 --> 01:32:57,909
I admit it was wrong to start it,
it was other people who kept it going.

1522
01:32:58,084 --> 01:32:59,642
Even the people at ADM.

1523
01:32:59,819 --> 01:33:01,446
My new lawyer sees that.

1524
01:33:02,655 --> 01:33:06,557
Tsk. This all goes back many years...

1525
01:33:07,393 --> 01:33:10,055
...before most of us were born.

1526
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:13,460
It's bigger than any of us...

1527
01:33:13,632 --> 01:33:15,190
...and it's ongoing.

1528
01:33:16,402 --> 01:33:19,166
I know you're skeptical,
but I've seen it.

1529
01:33:19,338 --> 01:33:23,468
My client, Mark Whitacre,
has shown it to me.

1530
01:33:24,243 --> 01:33:29,237
Maybe I am just a personal-injury lawyer
from Taylorville, "Nowhere" Illinois...

1531
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:32,014
...but I tell you...

1532
01:33:32,184 --> 01:33:36,382
...I know the identity
of the master puppeteer.

1533
01:33:39,091 --> 01:33:42,618
- The who?
- The master puppeteer.

1534
01:33:42,795 --> 01:33:44,422
And it's not who you're thinking.

1535
01:33:44,597 --> 01:33:49,296
Mark has tapes, tapes that the
government doesn't want us to hear.

1536
01:33:49,468 --> 01:33:52,767
Tapes that outline the actions
of Brian Shepard...

1537
01:33:52,938 --> 01:33:55,372
...who hit Mark Whitacre
with a briefcase...

1538
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:58,271
...while Mark was cooperating
with the government.

1539
01:33:58,444 --> 01:34:01,777
My client has a letter
from his psychiatrist...

1540
01:34:02,048 --> 01:34:08,510
...outlining and confirming the cruelty
perpetrated on him by Brian Shepard.

1541
01:34:09,288 --> 01:34:15,056
A letter from his psychiatrist clearly
exonerating my client from all wrongdoing.

1542
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:21,789
"It is obvious that the FBI
made some grand mistakes...

1543
01:34:21,967 --> 01:34:24,731
...in how they handled and treated you."
There's a phrase...

1544
01:34:24,904 --> 01:34:27,839
"Grand mistakes."
- Coming from a doctor.

1545
01:34:28,007 --> 01:34:30,498
"When one discusses suicide,
this is a red flag.

1546
01:34:30,676 --> 01:34:33,975
When one discusses how they will do it,
then it is very, very serious.

1547
01:34:34,146 --> 01:34:37,638
I also feel that the FBI requiring you
to do unethical conduct...

1548
01:34:37,817 --> 01:34:40,081
...against ADM was another blunder...

1549
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:43,288
...that forced you into a bipolar situation.

1550
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:46,857
They should have known better
and noted that a medical problem exists.

1551
01:34:47,026 --> 01:34:51,986
From a medical point of view, this is
attempted murder that the FBI did to you.

1552
01:34:52,164 --> 01:34:55,224
From a legal view,
your lawyer needs to decide what to do...

1553
01:34:55,401 --> 01:34:58,632
...and what the terminology is.
I'll support you in whatever you need.

1554
01:34:58,804 --> 01:35:02,296
You and your family have been through
too much turmoil with the government.

1555
01:35:02,475 --> 01:35:04,033
They should know better."

1556
01:35:06,045 --> 01:35:08,036
That's Dr. Miller.

1557
01:35:08,881 --> 01:35:11,042
SHEPARD:
I read the letter, Mark.

1558
01:35:12,017 --> 01:35:14,417
The problem with the letter is...

1559
01:35:15,354 --> 01:35:17,015
...it's a lie.

1560
01:35:18,023 --> 01:35:19,752
MARK:
What are you talking about, Brian?

1561
01:35:20,259 --> 01:35:23,717
It's on his letterhead.
That's his signature.

1562
01:35:23,896 --> 01:35:27,662
- What are you talking about?
- The area code, Mark.

1563
01:35:28,467 --> 01:35:32,767
In the letterhead? The area code 847?

1564
01:35:33,672 --> 01:35:36,732
This letter was written
in November 1995.

1565
01:35:36,909 --> 01:35:40,037
That area code didn't exist then.

1566
01:35:42,715 --> 01:35:47,550
Okay, but they announced that the change
was coming. I even remember that.

1567
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:51,918
- People order their stationery early.
SHEPARD: I thought about that.

1568
01:35:52,091 --> 01:35:54,025
So I asked the phone company.

1569
01:35:57,563 --> 01:36:02,762
This is the press release
announcing the new 847 area code.

1570
01:36:02,935 --> 01:36:06,962
It's dated six days after your letter
was written.

1571
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:10,472
Miller could not have known about it.

1572
01:36:15,247 --> 01:36:18,774
MARK: Ron Henkoff from Fortune called
Dr. Miller and Miller confirmed the letter.

1573
01:36:18,951 --> 01:36:21,078
If you talk to Henkoff...

1574
01:36:24,623 --> 01:36:28,491
Ron Henkoff from Fortune magazine...

1575
01:36:29,762 --> 01:36:32,595
...verified the letter with Dr. Miller.

1576
01:36:32,765 --> 01:36:35,734
- I talked to Dr. Miller, Mark.
MARK: You can't...

1577
01:36:35,901 --> 01:36:38,563
MARK: That's a violation
of my doctor-patient confidentiality.

1578
01:36:38,737 --> 01:36:43,640
That's a total violation of my doctor-patient
confidentiality. You can't call Miller.

1579
01:36:43,809 --> 01:36:48,246
Doctor-patient confidentiality
doesn't apply to forgeries.

1580
01:36:48,414 --> 01:36:52,145
Then why did Fortune magazine
run the story?

1581
01:36:52,318 --> 01:36:55,446
Well, why would Ron Henkoff,
for Fortune magazine...

1582
01:36:55,621 --> 01:36:57,782
...put it in a cover story?

1583
01:36:57,957 --> 01:36:59,356
Stop it, Mark.

1584
01:37:00,292 --> 01:37:02,624
Henk... If you talk to Henkoff...

1585
01:37:02,795 --> 01:37:05,093
You need to stop doing this to yourself.

1586
01:37:07,366 --> 01:37:10,301
Why do you...? Why do you keep lying?

1587
01:37:12,905 --> 01:37:14,805
I don't know.

1588
01:37:21,614 --> 01:37:24,777
Well, I think maybe I should go back
to the hospital.

1589
01:37:30,089 --> 01:37:36,824
WOMAN: Case 97-2001, United States
of America v. Mark Whitacre.

1590
01:37:37,997 --> 01:37:40,557
You have a right to make a statement,
if you wish.

1591
01:37:45,938 --> 01:37:47,405
Thank you.

1592
01:37:49,441 --> 01:37:54,242
Uh... I really appreciate the opportunity...

1593
01:37:54,413 --> 01:37:58,611
...to get up here and say a few words.
Um...

1594
01:38:01,754 --> 01:38:03,278
Wow.

1595
01:38:04,056 --> 01:38:05,580
What a ride.

1596
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:07,591
Um...

1597
01:38:08,127 --> 01:38:09,924
Been a long five years.

1598
01:38:11,697 --> 01:38:13,562
A lot of memories.

1599
01:38:15,701 --> 01:38:19,933
I just really want to apologize
to a lot of people in this room...

1600
01:38:20,105 --> 01:38:23,939
...and a lot of people who aren't
in this room, um...

1601
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:26,871
...for my actions.

1602
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:30,210
I'm on medication now...

1603
01:38:30,382 --> 01:38:34,113
...so I'm seeing things
a lot more clearly.

1604
01:38:34,286 --> 01:38:38,052
And I just really want to...

1605
01:38:38,223 --> 01:38:41,021
I realize I hurt a lot of people,
and so I want to say:

1606
01:38:41,193 --> 01:38:43,753
I'm so, so, so sorry. I greatly apologize...

1607
01:38:44,396 --> 01:38:49,095
...and accept responsibility for my actions.
That's it.

1608
01:38:49,268 --> 01:38:51,031
Thank you.

1609
01:38:53,072 --> 01:38:58,704
To observe that Mr. Whitacre is not the
usual felon is a gross understatement.

1610
01:38:59,411 --> 01:39:00,969
He's well-educated...

1611
01:39:01,146 --> 01:39:05,742
...has a loving wife and family,
is well-respected in the community.

1612
01:39:05,918 --> 01:39:08,478
It's not inconceivable that,
in due course...

1613
01:39:08,654 --> 01:39:13,614
...he could have been CEO
of Archer Daniels Midland.

1614
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:17,228
However, this court...

1615
01:39:18,197 --> 01:39:22,293
...can find no clear connection between
Mr. Whitacre's bipolar disorder...

1616
01:39:22,468 --> 01:39:26,370
...and the 45 counts of criminal
misconduct he's been charged with...

1617
01:39:26,538 --> 01:39:28,233
...just garden-variety greed.

1618
01:39:28,407 --> 01:39:31,865
It's very difficult to tell
when Mr. Whitacre is telling the truth.

1619
01:39:33,445 --> 01:39:35,208
I don't think what happened is fair...

1620
01:39:35,381 --> 01:39:38,407
...when you look at me compared
to Mick and Terry.

1621
01:39:39,785 --> 01:39:42,481
If you go
and hold up your local grocery store...

1622
01:39:42,654 --> 01:39:44,622
...you get maybe five years in prison.

1623
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:49,887
Mick and Terry held up every grocery
store in the world and they got three.

1624
01:39:50,129 --> 01:39:53,360
So you tell me how it makes sense
that I get nine.

1625
01:39:54,266 --> 01:39:56,166
You should consider that,
Mr. President...

1626
01:39:56,335 --> 01:39:59,133
...when reviewing this request
for pardon.

1627
01:39:59,571 --> 01:40:01,562
I'd also like to take this
opportunity...

1628
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:05,141
...to apologize on behalf of myself
and my wife, Ginger...

1629
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:07,175
...to Special Agent Brian Shepard.

1630
01:40:07,346 --> 01:40:11,680
He never hit me with a briefcase
or told me to destroy tapes.

1631
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:16,583
The idea to sue him
came from someone inside ADM.

1632
01:40:16,755 --> 01:40:19,519
I shouldn't have listened.
I don't even remember who it was.

1633
01:40:20,492 --> 01:40:25,520
While I was there at ADM, I lived so many
lives, I didn't really know who I was.

1634
01:40:26,265 --> 01:40:31,202
And I know today more who I am
and what I really want out of life.

1635
01:40:31,370 --> 01:40:36,467
I've completed three postgraduate
degrees while in detention...

1636
01:40:36,642 --> 01:40:39,509
...a J.D., which is, of course,
a law degree...

1637
01:40:39,678 --> 01:40:42,909
...another advanced degree
in the psychology of jury selection.

1638
01:40:43,449 --> 01:40:46,748
I sleep better here in prison
than I have in years.

1639
01:40:46,919 --> 01:40:49,979
My wife, Ginger, has forgiven me.

1640
01:40:50,789 --> 01:40:53,280
She actually believes
that this incident with ADM...

1641
01:40:53,525 --> 01:40:57,552
...brought us closer together
in a marriage of over 20 years.

1642
01:40:57,996 --> 01:40:59,964
And I hope you'll allow me
to leave here...

1643
01:41:00,132 --> 01:41:03,829
...so that I can rejoin that life
with my family, my three kids...

1644
01:41:04,002 --> 01:41:05,367
...two of whom are adopted.

1645
01:41:05,871 --> 01:41:09,830
Especially in light of the fact that
in large part because of my testimony...

1646
01:41:10,008 --> 01:41:13,136
...the United States government
has to date been able to collect...

1647
01:41:13,312 --> 01:41:17,271
...over one billion dollars in price-fixing
fines from big businesses.

1648
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:20,883
So that's it. Thanks.

1649
01:41:31,797 --> 01:41:33,560
Good luck with the pardon, Mark.

1650
01:41:33,732 --> 01:41:37,224
Thanks, Bob. Thanks for helping me
remember everything.

1651
01:41:37,402 --> 01:41:39,336
I wish Brian could have come.

1652
01:41:39,571 --> 01:41:43,337
- Well, he's still pretty angry.
- Yeah.

1653
01:41:43,509 --> 01:41:46,842
Well, tell him I'm real sorry.
Will you do that?

1654
01:41:47,012 --> 01:41:48,274
Sure, Mark.

1655
01:41:48,447 --> 01:41:50,813
The irony is
if I hadn't gone undercover...

1656
01:41:50,983 --> 01:41:54,578
...I never would have stole the 11
and a half million. It was my way out.

1657
01:41:54,753 --> 01:41:58,086
It was my severance. What else
was I gonna do? I had to write my own.

1659
01:42:00,425 --> 01:42:01,756
See you, Bob.

1660
01:42:02,027 --> 01:42:04,825
- Uh-uh... Uh-uh... Eleven and a half million?
- What?

1661
01:42:04,997 --> 01:42:06,897
I thought it was nine and a half.

1662
01:42:07,065 --> 01:42:09,829
- What did I say?
- You said 11 and a half.

1663
01:42:10,002 --> 01:42:13,802
You do know that the people at ADM
think you were the mole.

1664
01:42:13,972 --> 01:42:17,373
That you planted the virus,
then made it go away.

1665
01:42:17,609 --> 01:42:20,510
The 11 and a half
is with the interest.

1666
01:42:21,446 --> 01:42:24,438
Mark, is it nine and a half
or 11 and a half?
