prime numbers, factoring.

171
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:30,551
- Cryptography.
- Very good.

172
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:33,747
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

173
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:35,757
Way out of profile
for a guy like that.

174
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:39,852
It's our job to be curious, so we traced
the money. Guess where it comes from?

175
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,659
- I know you're not gonna say Russia.
- Yeah.

176
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:46,599
Give me a break. We won, they lost, you
know? It's been in a couple of papers.

177
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:48,967
Yeah, we still spy on them.
They still spy on us.

178
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:51,336
We intercepted
a fax last week. Here.

179
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:54,934
Making some kind of box,
a little black box.

180
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,174
The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

181
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:01,443
- Security technology--
- Sensor techniques, who knows?

182
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:05,715
It may be nothing or it may be
something. And we need to know.

183
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:09,189
Your job is to find that little
black box. Let us take a look at it.

184
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:11,249
- Yeah.
- No way.

185
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:14,763
Sorry, Marty. We don't have
a lot of choice here.

186
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,096
- Do it yourself.
- We can't.

187
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:21,103
By law, we're not allowed or equipped
to do this kind of operation.

188
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,698
- Then get the F.B.I.
- Yeah, right, the F.B.I.

189
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:29,505
The F.B.I. can't work for us without
approval from a congressional committee.

190
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:31,637
- We don't have the time.
- So, why me?

191
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:35,582
- Frankly, because we--
- Yeah, frankly.

192
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:39,985
Marty, sit down, please.

193
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,990
Frankly, because it's kind of illegal.

194
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:46,585
You've stayed underground more than 20
years. You know how not to get caught.

195
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:48,596
We know you can keep
your mouth shut.

196
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:51,258
Job pays $175,000,
payable on delivery.

197
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,134
You can distribute it among the poor,
if you like.

198
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,469
- Pass.
- We also clean up your record.

199
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,475
Quash the outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

200
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:04,445
Your pal, Cosmo, got 12 years. That was
without flight to evade prosecution.

201
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:07,914
We all know what happened
to him in there.

202
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:14,955
If I say no?

203
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:17,356
Don't say no.

204
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:21,624
What good would you do
anybody in prison?

205
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:26,031
[ Crease ] I don't believe this.
You lied to us all these years.

206
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:28,262
- Even lied to us about your name.
- Sorry, okay?

207
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:33,172
I'm sorry, but when you're wanted by the
feds, you don't go telling everybody.

208
00:17:33,242 --> 00:17:36,678
We're not everybody, Martin,
we're your partners. You tell us.

209
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:40,476
Fine. Exactly why was it
you had to leave the C.I.A.?

210
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:47,020
We all have our little secrets,
don't we?

211
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,717
Look, you guys have
a decision to make.

212
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:53,956
This is not a test. The penetration
is live, the target is unaware.

213
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:58,489
Sneaking a foreign intelligence service
that might kill us is not what we do.

214
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:02,526
The probable level of security
is very low.

215
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:06,666
But if you guys don't want to take that
chance just to keep me out of jail...

216
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:08,710
fine, I understand, don't do it.

217
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:14,409
Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other
guys, but I'm in it for the money.

218
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:17,418
- I don't care if you go to jail.
- Me neither. I'm in.

219
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:22,685
Uh, could we maybe just go back
to the "they might kill us" part?

220
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:26,421
If I thought that was likely, I wouldn't
bring this to you. But there is a risk.

221
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:32,058
- It pays $175,000!
- I'm in.

222
00:18:37,306 --> 00:18:42,972
You guys'll be chalk outlines
without me. All right, what do we need?

223
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:45,570
[ Martin ] Okay. We start
with a very light surveillance.

224
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:48,583
Level three. First sign
of baby-sitters, we back off.

225
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:51,176
Now, this guy's giving a lecture
tomorrow at U.C. In the afternoon.

226
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:54,051
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

227
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,489
Okay, let's do it.

228
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,925
[ Crease ] For the lecture, you wanna
take Whistler or do you want me?

229
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:03,954
Uh, no, that's okay,
I thought I'd ask Liz.

230
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:14,965
[ Piano ]

231
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,533
Who's this?

232
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,205
Sort of an old friend.

233
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:55,944
Practice!
Practice, practice!

234
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:02,987
- Hi.
- We're not getting back together.

235
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:05,288
- Did I say anything?
- You will.

236
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:06,919
I'm here on business, Liz.

237
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:10,796
Bishop, you don't have a business,
you have a club. It's a boy's club.

238
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,462
You have a little clubhouse,
you probably have a secret handshake.

239
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:16,527
Liz, I need your help.

240
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:19,199
I will not be dragged back
into your world.

241
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:23,506
I have a new group of gifted children,
and I like the fact they're under 30.

242
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:25,570
Excuse me.

243
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:28,411
There's a mathematician named
Gunter Janek. You know him?

244
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:30,418
I've read him.
Now go away.

245
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:34,889
- He's giving a master lecture at 3:30--
- How nice for him.

246
00:20:34,923 --> 00:20:38,017
- I thought I'd buy you dinner after.
- I am not going out with you.

247
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:42,393
This isn't a date, dummy. This is
a scientific exploration, a tutorial.

248
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:46,127
I need you...

249
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,601
to explain it to me.

250
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:53,364
Read a book.

251
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,934
They found me, Liz.

252
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:59,173
The government found me.

253
00:20:59,248 --> 00:21:02,775
They offered me a deal.
If I take their offer...

254
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:05,513
they clear my record
and I can get my name back.

255
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,055
You and I are not
getting back together.

256
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:21,068
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

257
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,795
Pick me up at 3:00.

258
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:28,342
Yes!

259
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:32,138
While the number field sieve is
the best method currently known...

260
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:37,584
there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

261
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,056
- This guy's good.
- Shh.

262
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:46,724
...over the rationals, and hence
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

263
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:49,754
Using the Artin map,
we might induce homomorphisms--

264
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:54,792
- You seeing anybody?
- Shh.

265
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,738
These maps could then be used to combine
splitting information from all the Zs.

266
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:03,039
This isn't just about large
number theory. It's about cryptography.

267
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:05,443
Oh? You mean codes?

268
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:08,813
I mean unbreakable codes.

269
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:13,878
It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions...

270
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:15,856
and allow us to acquire...

271
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:20,452
the solution in a dramatically
more efficient manner.

272
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:24,057
- Are you seeing anyb--
- Shh.

273
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:25,828
Such an approach is
purely theoretical.

274
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:28,166
So far, no one
has been able...

275
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:32,333
to accomplish
such constructions...

276
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:35,537
yet.

277
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:38,102
The numbers are
so unbelievably big...

278
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,944
all the computers in the world
could not break them down.

279
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:44,110
But maybe, just maybe...

280
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:48,816
- there's a shortcut.
- I'll bet you anything he's found it.

281
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:52,292
If he has, you're in over your head.
I'll get my coat.

282
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:54,352
Numbers themselves
may be our best tools.

283
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:58,889
May be able to see things
in other numbers that we can't.

284
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,367
- Martin.
- Uh.

285
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:03,961
Martin, how wonderful
to see you.

286
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,405
- Hi, Greg. How are you?
- Is it not fabulous?

287
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:10,673
Today I can in public come and learn
your scientists' new secrets.

288
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:14,079
Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

289
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:17,710
At least I, l-- Oh!
Goodness, can it be?

290
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:19,811
Hmm? Oh, yeah.

291
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:22,379
- Elizabeth!
- She's dying to talk to you too, Greg.

292
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:25,824
Excuse me.
Elizabeth.

293
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:28,522
Elizabeth.

294
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:32,590
- Hello, Greg.
- Elizabeth and Martin.

295
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:36,160
My heart leaps like gazelle
to see you back together again.

296
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:38,672
Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

297
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,937
No? Oh, what a pity.

298
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,036
Wait. I have smashing idea.
Martin!

299
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,138
Martin!

300
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:50,378
Kiev String Quartet plays
at the consulate on Thursday night.

301
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:53,853
You will be my guests.

302
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:57,016
- I wouldn't know how to repay you.
- Heh, heh.

303
00:23:57,092 --> 00:24:00,960
Martin, now that our countries
are such good friends...

304
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:04,487
perhaps you will finally be able
to do occasional favor for me?

305
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:08,264
- [ Liz ] Gregor, you are shameless.
- See you Thursday night.

306
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:10,566
What?

307
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:12,597
Ah, new title.

308
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:16,872
- [ Greg ] Cultural attache.
- Unbelievable!

309
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:21,143
Last few years has been very confusing
for people in my line of work.

310
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:23,650
I'll bet.

311
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:29,282
[ Liz ] I don't care what anybody says
about the new world order.

312
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:31,292
I don't trust that guy.

313
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,158
Who, Greg?
He's harmless.

314
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:36,197
Let the number itself
tell us.

315
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:42,333
If you'll excuse me...

316
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:47,934
- I have some work.
- You're gonna follow him, aren't you?

317
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,444
- Liz, l--
- It's okay. I'll get a cab.

318
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:52,446
Can I call you?

319
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,483
Just be careful.

320
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,305
Janek just got
in the elevator.

321
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:23,970
- Going up.
- [ Carl ] We will be ready for him.

322
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:27,140
- How's the audio?
- [ Whistler ] Good. Mother's close.

323
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:30,981
[ Crease ] He's just wearing
four safety belts this time.

324
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:33,146
[ Martin ] What, no parachute?

325
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:36,713
[ Carl ] All righty.
Entry and lights on.

326
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:40,592
- Describe it.
- Looks like a workroom.

327
00:25:40,662 --> 00:25:45,622
A bench with a soldering gun, two spools
of wire and a magnifying lamp.

328
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:49,797
[ Whistler ] Yeah, sounds like
he's making somethin'.

329
00:25:49,871 --> 00:25:52,897
- Then a desk.
- Mmm-hmm.

330
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:57,240
Telephone, lamp,
answering machine.

331
00:25:57,312 --> 00:25:59,337
A jar of pencils,

What's he doing?

Oh! Dr. Rhyzkov, good evening.

Hey, let's get an I.D. on Dr. Rhyzkov.
She was with him this afternoon.

in Mexico City.

Huh. I didn't know you could
do that in Mexico City.

- Next to the L.

of the same system that NASA used...

the Apollo moon landings.

around the world from a soundstage...

- Wait one minute.

00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,240
for an interview with
President Eisenhower.

498
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,677
Ike said, "Give us technology, we'll
give you all the cow lips you want."

499
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:09,012
Don't listen to this man.
He's certifiable.

500
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,017
Your husband knows
about cattle mutilations.

501
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:14,646
He's ex-C.I.A. He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

[ Carl ] Understood, understood.

503
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:19,691
One thing I don't quite get,
though, is...

00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:22,389
was you and Cosmo,
you were taking all these chances...

505
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:27,958
all these big chances,
what for?

506
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:32,062
We were young.
And there was a war on.

507
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:37,509
- It was a good way to meet girls.
- Not bad.

508
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:40,308
How come you didn't get caught?

509
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:50,089
I went out for pizza.
Then I went to Canada.

510
00:37:50,158 --> 00:37:52,683
I was lucky. He wasn't.

511
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,354
[ Whistler ] Did he ever forgive you?

512
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,424
I hope so.
He died in prison.

513
00:38:08,543 --> 00:38:11,444
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

514
00:38:11,512 --> 00:38:14,811
Don?

515
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:19,114
- We've never been to Europe together.
- That's right.

516
00:38:19,187 --> 00:38:22,588
And we are going.

517
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:26,787
- Madrid, Lisbon.
- Athens. Oh, and Scotland.

518
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:29,125
- And Tahiti.
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

519
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:33,156
- Mother?
- Well, you know...

520
00:38:33,234 --> 00:38:37,432
I've never actually had a really cool
car that I could fit comfortably into.

521
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:40,440
So I think I'm gonna
buy me a Winnebago...

522
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:45,070
with a big kitchen,
water bed, big kitchen.

[ Altered Voice ] I'd like to have
a deep relationship...

525
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:55,318
with a beautiful woman who melts
from the very first time our eyes meet.

526

We're not getting paid
that much, Carl.

527

Well, you know,

528
00:39:01,162 --> 00:39:04,325

not getting paid that much.

- [ Liz ] That's not a word, "scrunchy".
- [ Martin ] Yes, it is. Yeah.

- You know what happens to your face?

538
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:33,122
- Please, it's not a word.
- Right now your face is scrunchy.

539
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,425
[ Crease ] All right.
We gotta take it as a word.

[ Indistinct Chatter ]

541
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:45,435
[ Liz ] It's better than "scrunchy."

542
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:48,634
- [ Crease ] I have--
- [ Martin ] I didn't invent the word.

- [ Whistler ] Carl?
- [ Carl ] Yes?

544
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:53,503
What does it say where this is?

00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:59,383
Hold on a second here.
"System out."

547
00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:07,424
I really think you should
leave that thing alone.

548
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:10,487
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to
see something. Don't worry, Don.

549
00:40:14,468 --> 00:40:18,564
- How are they spelling Setec?
- S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

- Earthling counter.
- Oh!

Is that right?
Two, four, five.

And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around...

554
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:37,184
and looks at me
like right dead in my eye.

555
00:40:37,258 --> 00:40:39,192
- Setec.
- What?

Setec astronomy.

557
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,191
I just love it when
a man says that to me.

558
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:48,201
Setec doesn't
mean anything.

559

Excuse me, um--

564
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:43,720
Does "Monterey's coast"
mean anything to you guys?

- No.
- No.

- Here, help me with this.
- Okay.

Hmm. Stay in that quadrant.

It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

Whoa. Mother, what was that?
Go back one.

Okay. We won't get in.

Oh, my God.

[ Mother ] How is this possible?

606
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:51,136
Cryptography systems are based
on mathematical problems...

607
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:54,140
so complex they cannot
be solved without a key.

608
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:58,144
Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key...

609
00:45:58,212 --> 00:46:01,613
- and he hard-wired it into that chip.
- Turn it off.

610
00:46:01,682 --> 00:46:05,482
- Want to crash some passenger jets?
- I said turn it off.

611
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:07,679
Turn it off.

612
00:46:18,465 --> 00:46:20,592
So it's a code-breaker.

613
00:46:20,668 --> 00:46:24,866
No, it's the code-breaker.

614
00:46:28,075 --> 00:46:30,009
No more secrets.

01:49:32,889 --> 01:49:36,985
You gotta drive.
I'll talk you through it. Now, hurry.

1333
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:39,426
D-D-Drive what?

1334
01:49:57,514 --> 01:49:59,448
Okay, Bish.

1335
01:49:59,516 --> 01:50:02,212
There's a gate
about 30 yards behind you.

1336
01:50:02,285 --> 01:50:04,617
Put it in reverse
and floor it.

1337
01:50:04,688 --> 01:50:09,250
Did I ever tell you why
I had to leave the C.I.A.?

1338
01:50:09,326 --> 01:50:11,385
[ Mother ] N-No.

1339
01:50:14,898 --> 01:50:17,458
Uh, what's reverse?

1340
01:50:17,534 --> 01:50:19,798
Uh, one down.

1341
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:22,395
My temper.

1342
01:50:22,472 --> 01:50:24,531
[ Screeching ]

1343
01:50:27,711 --> 01:50:32,011
- Wow!
- Mess with me, I'll split your head!

1344
01:50:32,082 --> 01:50:36,644
Uh, Crease, where's Whistler going?

1345
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:40,451
Uh, Bish?
I'm going backwards.

1346
01:50:40,524 --> 01:50:43,584
You're doin' fine.
Doin' fine.

1347
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:46,128
[ Yelling ]

1348
01:50:46,196 --> 01:50:48,323
Now, hit the brakes!

1349
01:50:48,398 --> 01:50:51,162
- Now!
- [ Screeching ]

1350
01:50:51,234 --> 01:50:54,670
Okay, put the gearshift
down two notches.

1351
01:50:54,738 --> 01:50:58,230
Down two notches.

1352
01:50:58,308 --> 01:51:01,004
[ Martin ] Turn left.
Floor it.

1353
01:51:02,813 --> 01:51:06,146
- I-I-I'm going forward.
- Do-- uh, uh, straighten out.

1354
01:51:09,052 --> 01:51:12,078
- Oh, what was that?
- Okay, keep comin'.

1355
01:51:13,323 --> 01:51:15,848
Oh, God, I'm driving!
I'm driving!

1356
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:21,663
[ Yelling ] No, don't do that.
I'm driving!

1357
01:51:25,168 --> 01:51:27,966
[ Martin ] Whoa, whoa!
Go left!

1358
01:51:28,038 --> 01:51:30,029
My, my left. Right.

1359
01:51:30,106 --> 01:51:32,870
Go right! Right! Ri--

1360
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:38,604
It's okay.

1361
01:51:41,885 --> 01:51:44,911
Beautiful! Keep comin'.
Keep comin'.

1362
01:51:44,988 --> 01:51:48,685
Now, you're gonna go down
a very gentle slope.

1363
01:51:48,758 --> 01:51:50,817
Okay, fine.
Great. No problem.

1364
01:51:50,894 --> 01:51:53,727
[ Yelling ] Oh, boy!

1365
01:51:58,602 --> 01:52:00,627
Doin' okay.
Five more seconds...

1366
01:52:00,704 --> 01:52:02,968
and stop.

1367
01:52:04,808 --> 01:52:09,745
[ Groaning ] I think
I'll stop right here.

1368
01:52:09,813 --> 01:52:13,305
[ Liz Laughing ]
Whistler, that was great!

1369
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:15,181
- Whistler!
- That was great!

1370
01:52:15,218 --> 01:52:18,085
[ Carl ] I'm taking the wheel.
In the back.

1371
01:52:18,154 --> 01:52:20,054
Where's Martin?

1372
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:26,658
[ Cosmo ] Marty.

1373
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:30,689
Would you step away
from the ladder?

1374
01:52:49,786 --> 01:52:52,653
You will give me
the box right now...

1375
01:52:52,722 --> 01:52:55,714
or I will kill you right now.

1376
01:52:59,696 --> 01:53:01,926
No.

1377
01:53:02,866 --> 01:53:04,731
Jesus!

1378
01:53:04,801 --> 01:53:07,292
Just...
give me the box, Marty.

1379
01:53:07,337 --> 01:53:10,272
- I thought you couldn't kill me, Cos.
- I missed on purpose!

1380
01:53:10,307 --> 01:53:14,334
- Give me the box.
- Take the damn thing! I don't want it.

1381
01:53:14,377 --> 01:53:17,175
You win, I lose.
That's what you want, isn't it?

1382
01:53:17,213 --> 01:53:21,047
- Say it! Say it!
- Yes.

1383
01:53:25,588 --> 01:53:27,522
I'm sorry, Cos.

1384
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:29,455
- You could have shared this with me.
- I know.

1385
01:53:29,492 --> 01:53:32,017
- You could have had the power.
- I don't want it.

1386
01:53:32,262 --> 01:53:34,389
Don't you know the places
we can go with this?

1387
01:53:34,431 --> 01:53:38,663
- Yeah, I do. There's nobody there.
- Exactly.

1388
01:53:39,035 --> 01:53:42,129
The world isn't run by weapons anymore,
or energy or money.

1389
01:53:42,172 --> 01:53:46,472
It's run by ones and zeroes, little bits
of data. It's all just electrons.

1390
01:53:46,509 --> 01:53:48,773
I don't care.

1391
01:53:48,812 --> 01:53:51,508
I don't expect other people
to understand this...

1392
01:53:51,548 --> 01:53:54,108
but I do expect you
to understand this.

1393
01:53:54,150 --> 01:53:56,880
We started this journey together.

1394
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:59,980
It wasn't a journey, Cos.

1395
01:54:00,023 --> 01:54:02,321
It was a prank.

1396
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:07,126
There's a war out there,
old friend, a world war.

1397
01:54:07,163 --> 01:54:09,188
And it's not about
who's got the most bullets.

1398
01:54:09,232 --> 01:54:11,359
It's about who controls
the information:

1399
01:54:11,401 --> 01:54:14,529
What we see and hear,
how we work, what we think.

1400
01:54:14,571 --> 01:54:17,699
It's all about
the information.

1401
01:54:17,741 --> 01:54:21,507
If I were you,
I'd destroy that thing.

1402
01:54:21,544 --> 01:54:24,445
Don't go.

1403
01:54:28,184 --> 01:54:31,312
Don't go.

1404
01:54:35,458 --> 01:54:39,690
You do what you have to do, Cos.

1405
01:54:39,763 --> 01:54:42,391
But if you want to stop me...

1406
01:54:42,465 --> 01:54:45,696
you'll have to pull the trigger.

1407
01:54:46,669 --> 01:54:49,763
You.

1408
01:55:40,356 --> 01:55:43,519
[ Crease ] I can't believe
we actually made it back.

1409
01:55:43,593 --> 01:55:48,030
I can't believe we did the greatest
sneak in history and can't tell anybody.

1410
01:55:48,064 --> 01:55:51,033
You know what I can't believe?
Tomorrow's Thursday!

1411
01:55:51,067 --> 01:55:54,127
- Not one word.
- All of you, step over here.

1412
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:56,934
Hands over your head. Move!

1413
01:55:56,973 --> 01:55:59,441
Move!

1414
01:56:01,544 --> 01:56:04,035
[ Man ] Mr. Bishop.

1415
01:56:10,854 --> 01:56:15,154
I'm Bernard Abbott,
National Security Agency.

1416
01:56:16,059 --> 01:56:18,926
We spoke on the phone.

1417
01:56:18,995 --> 01:56:23,364
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1418
01:56:26,236 --> 01:56:28,898
It's interesting,
don't you think, you guys...

1419
01:56:28,972 --> 01:56:31,805
that the N.S.A. is here?

1420
01:56:31,875 --> 01:56:34,776
I thought the F.B.I. was supposed
to do this kind of thing.

1421
01:56:34,844 --> 01:56:36,641
Absolutely.
This is outside...

1422
01:56:36,679 --> 01:56:38,704
the N.S.A.'s jurisdiction.

1423
01:56:38,748 --> 01:56:42,980
Unless the N.S.A. didn't want anybody
to know about Janek's little black box.

1424
01:56:43,019 --> 01:56:46,511
I keep thinking
about something Greg told me.

1425
01:56:46,589 --> 01:56:49,149
He said our codes were based
on an entirely different system...

1426
01:56:49,192 --> 01:56:54,892
than the Russian codes, so this box
really wouldn't work on them.

1427
01:56:54,931 --> 01:56:58,492
The only thing it would really be
good for is spying on Americans.

1428
01:56:58,568 --> 01:57:01,469
Sure, with a box like that they
could read the F.B.I.'s mail.

1429
01:57:01,538 --> 01:57:05,133
- Or the C.I.A.'s.
- Or the White House's.

1430
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:08,302
No wonder they don't want to
share with the other children.

1431
01:57:08,378 --> 01:57:11,438
What do you want,
Mr. Bishop?

1432
01:57:13,917 --> 01:57:16,545
Clear up my record.

1433
01:57:16,619 --> 01:57:20,077
- Get outta my life.
- I don't have much choice, do I?

1434
01:57:20,156 --> 01:57:24,889
Not unless you wanna read
about it in "Newsweek."

1435
01:57:24,961 --> 01:57:28,590
- Deal. The box.
- [ Mother ] Not so fast.

1436
01:57:29,966 --> 01:57:33,458
- I want a Winnebago.
- What?

1437
01:57:33,536 --> 01:57:36,096
Fully equipped,
big kitchen, water bed...

1438
01:57:36,172 --> 01:57:38,436
AM-FM, CD, microwave.

1439
01:57:38,508 --> 01:57:40,339
This is not a
car dealership, pal.

1440
01:57:40,376 --> 01:57:44,369
He wants a Winnebago.

1441
01:57:47,083 --> 01:57:49,483
All right,
a Winnebago.

1442
01:57:49,552 --> 01:57:52,817
Thank you.
Burgundy interior.

1443
01:57:52,889 --> 01:57:56,655
- Now the box.
- [ Crease ] Ahem.

1444
01:57:56,726 --> 01:58:00,560
Uh, I have never taken
my wife to Europe.

1445
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:03,793
I'm sorry to hear it.
Give me the box.

1446
01:58:03,866 --> 01:58:06,198
You will buy me two...

1447
01:58:06,236 --> 01:58:09,034
round-trip, first-class
tickets to Athens...

1448
01:58:09,072 --> 01:58:12,769
Lisbon, Madrid
and Scotland.

1449
01:58:12,809 --> 01:58:16,745
- Don't forget Tahiti.
- And Tahiti.

1450
01:58:16,779 --> 01:58:19,247
- Tahiti is not in Europe.
- [ Carl ] Excuse me.

1451
01:58:19,282 --> 01:58:22,740
When you get the box,
then you give us geography lessons.

1452
01:58:22,785 --> 01:58:26,118
Until then,
this man goes to Tahiti.

1453
01:58:26,155 --> 01:58:29,215
Fine! Tahiti!

1454
01:58:30,493 --> 01:58:32,427
[ Martin ] Carl?

1455
01:58:32,495 --> 01:58:38,161
The young lady with the Uzi,
is she single?

1456
01:58:38,234 --> 01:58:41,260
[ Martin ] Carl. Excuse us.

1457
01:58:43,273 --> 01:58:47,607
This is the brass ring.
You gotta think bigger thoughts.

1458
01:58:47,677 --> 01:58:50,737
I just want
her telephone number.

1459
01:58:52,348 --> 01:58:54,509
Please.

1460
01:58:56,953 --> 01:58:59,251
- How about a lunch? You can chaperon.
- No.

1461
01:58:59,322 --> 01:59:04,350
- I will not do this.
- Hey, Abby, come on.

1462
01:59:04,427 --> 01:59:07,157
- The F.B.I.'d give him twins.
- No!

1463
01:59:07,230 --> 01:59:10,859
[ Girl ] Wait a second.

1464
01:59:10,933 --> 01:59:15,529
You can have anything you want,
and you're asking for my phone number?

1465
01:59:15,605 --> 01:59:17,539
Yes.

1466
01:59:19,375 --> 01:59:22,310
273-9164...

1467
01:59:22,378 --> 01:59:26,405
area code 415.

1468
01:59:26,482 --> 01:59:28,643
- I'm Carl.
- I'm Mary.

1469
01:59:28,718 --> 01:59:31,084
I'm going to be sick.

1470
01:59:31,154 --> 01:59:33,884
- [ Abbott ] Are we done here?
- [ Martin ] Not yet. Whistler.

1471
01:59:37,026 --> 01:59:40,655
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1472
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:43,221
- This is ridiculous.
- He's serious.

1473
01:59:43,299 --> 01:59:45,460
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1474
01:59:45,535 --> 01:59:49,733
We are the United States Government.
We don't do that sort of thing.

1475
01:59:49,806 --> 01:59:53,367
You're just gonna
have to try.

1476
01:59:53,443 --> 01:59:56,412
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

1477
01:59:56,479 --> 01:59:59,346
Thank you very much.

1478
01:59:59,415 --> 02:00:01,383
That's all I ask.

1479
02:00:03,653 --> 02:00:05,883
How about you?
What do you want?

1480
02:00:05,955 --> 02:00:08,321
Oh, I'm fine.

1481
02:00:11,994 --> 02:00:14,690
May I have the box?

1482
02:00:23,606 --> 02:00:25,574
You know it doesn't work.

1483
02:00:25,641 --> 02:00:28,633
It never did.

1484
02:00:28,711 --> 02:00:31,271
That's not important, is it?
What's really important is...

1485
02:00:31,314 --> 02:00:34,545
that none of this ever happened.

1486
02:00:34,617 --> 02:00:36,949
This box doesn't exist.

1487
02:00:37,019 --> 02:00:40,352
I never saw it before.

1488
02:00:40,423 --> 02:00:44,018
Remember that.

1489
02:00:52,802 --> 02:00:55,134
Bishop?

1490
02:00:55,204 --> 02:00:58,935
All you did was say
it was broken.

1491
02:00:59,008 --> 02:01:04,105
Can't they still just hook it up
and do terrible things with it?

1492
02:01:06,315 --> 02:01:07,839
Nope.

1493
02:01:08,551 --> 02:01:10,917
In a surprise announcement,
the Republican National Committee...

1494
02:01:10,953 --> 02:01:13,717
has revealed it is bankrupt.

1495
02:01:13,756 --> 02:01:17,556
A spokesman said they had plenty
of money in their accounts last week...

1496
02:01:17,593 --> 02:01:20,858
but today they just don't know
where the money has gone.

1497
02:01:20,897 --> 02:01:22,865
