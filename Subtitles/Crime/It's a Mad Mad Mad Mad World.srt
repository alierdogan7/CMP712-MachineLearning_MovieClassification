00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,426
Must have had an aunt
named Aunt Belle.

180
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,095
All right!

181
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,099
Did he make any kind of statement?
Any last messages?

182
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,227
He didn't make that clear at all.

183
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,896
He didn't make anything clear.
Can we get going?

184
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,898
Just a minute.

185
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,442
I'll get your names
and where you can be reached.

186
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,153
We're on our honeymoon.
We don't know where we'll be.

187
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,572
We can't stick around.

188
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,701
We're due in Las Vegas.
We don't know how long we'll stay there.

189
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,204
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma
before I get back to...

190
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,248
We stopped to see if we could help.

191
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,458
We was too late. Let us go, okay?

192
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,378
We'll hold services for him later.
We got our lives to live.

193
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,506
- We ain't had breakfast yet.
- All right.

194
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,967
I'll have to get your name, anyway.

195
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,303
Hold it.

196
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,472
Me?

197
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,894
- Why?
- In case the coroner wants a statement.

198
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,481
J. Russell Finch,
2790 Penrose Boulevard, Fresno.

199
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,319
I won't be home for a few weeks
but you can get me through my office.

200
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,988
- What'd you say?
- Where is your office?

201
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,950
Pacific Edible Seaweed Company
and it's in Fresno.

202
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,703
- You can call my secretary.
- Ambulance is on its way.

203
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,829
Yeah.

204
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,539
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

205
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,501
We'd better shift those cars.
They're on the curb.

206
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,004
That's all we can get from this group.

207
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,964
Thank you, gentlemen.

208
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,341
Thanks.

209
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,391
Well...

210
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,102
There's an unexpected twist for you.

211
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,813
They're not going to like this
down at Santa Rosita.

212
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,858
- Culpeper's going to scream.
- Yeah.

213
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,028
- We better get our story straight if...
- What story?

214
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,614
He woke up as usual.
He started driving his car.

215
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,240
He stopped for breakfast.

216
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,993
He went to the gents' room,
climbed out the back window.

217
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,956
So what? Even Culpeper can't say
we should've been in there with him.

218
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,084
What got me is the way
he went sailing out there.

219
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,463
If I have to climb much more,
I'll be laying there with him.

220
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,631
Poor soul.

221
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,467
[Man coughing]

222
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,264
[All] Uh...

223
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,226
Melville, what happened?

224
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,646
We couldn't do anything for him.
Nothing we could do. Come on.

225
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,064
[Woman] Well?

226
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,193
Uh...

227
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,071
- It was a terrible thing.
- Russell, I feel sick.

228
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,698
Take it easy. These things happen.

229
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,534
What kind of attitude is that,
"these things happen"?

230
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,787
They only happen because this country
is full of people...

231
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,748
...who, when things happen,
just say, "These things happen."

232
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,585
- And that's why they happen!
- Let's try not to get upset.

233
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,087
Come on.

234
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,464
We got to have control
of what happens to us.

235
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,342
If we left it up to you,
we'd never hear the last of it.

236
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,095
- [Woman continues]
- [Russell] You're right.

237
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,104
[Woman] Do you know what those half-wit
morons up in Sacramento do about it?

238
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,649
They just sit there with their big feet
up on their big desk...

239
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:11,612
...milking 15 million people of...
- Listen, I want to say something.

240
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,115
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I've got to say something.

241
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,285
- What are you looking at?
- I'm watching something.

242
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,454
Benjy, turn around, sit still.

243
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:23,249
- Play it straight.
- They're not kiddin'. They went for it.

244
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,626
Yeah? What are you going to do now?

245
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,380
I want you to tell me everything
that man told you, word for word.

246
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,465
Don't leave out anything.

247
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,508
But do you think he really meant it?

248
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,723
Monica, I don't know about anybody else,
but some of them believed it.

249
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,934
Like those two back there.
[Shouts] Don't look over there!

250
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,438
I know where it is. It's under a big W.
That's what he said.

251
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,899
Like a windmill or a waterfall
or something.

252
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,777
I hope it's not under a waterfall.
[Chuckles]

253
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,446
Think of something that starts with a W.

254
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,157
Wealth. Which.

255
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,409
Let's see. Where.

256
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,995
Work. That's it.
I got to work on where it is.

257
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,416
One thing Dr. Carroll said was Russell
was to have no undue excitement...

258
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,168
...for at least two weeks
because of his condition.

259
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,128
- But...
- That's why we came on this trip...

260
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,006
...so Russell could relax.
You should have told the police.

261
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,759
You keep saying that.
What's the police got to do with it?

262
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,096
I think the police were chasing him.
They drove up so fast.

263
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,182
Why shouldn't they've been chasing him?
He was speeding.

264
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,184
I'm only thinking
of Russell's condition.

265
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,855
You mean his financial condition.
That's the only condition he has.

266
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,526
Do you know why your husband
had a nervous breakdown?

267
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:36,322
It's because he has sunk $40,000,
including $15,000 of my money...

268
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,909
...into a company that makes
seaweed for people to eat.

269
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,246
Not only does nobody like it,
it costs $4 a can.

270
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,540
- Yeah, but...
- "Yeah, but," what?

271
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,708
Most people like it and I like it.

272
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,086
I'm working hard,
trying to keep the costs down.

273
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,380
You were working hard
to keep the costs down...

274
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,716
...the day you ran
into the street screaming.

275
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,137
- Mother!
- Emmeline, shut up! And you, too!

276
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,722
Maybe he was playing
a trick on everybody.

277
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,517
Did you think about that?
He might have been a practical joker.

278
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,937
Oh... Monica! Practical!

279
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,732
What kind of man is going to play a
practical joke on complete strangers...

280
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,485
...with every bone in his body broken?

281
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,738
- Watch! Watchtower!
- No.

282
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,948
- Wall...
- No.

283
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,867
- Walnut tree.
- No, no!

284
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,160
- Walnuts.
- No!

285
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,911
- In bags.
- No!

286
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,291
Why are we doing only 35?
Step on it! See what happens.

287
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,459
- Mother!
- They'll see what we're doing.

288
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,587
Go ahead and try it.
What've you got to lose?

289
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,089
Mother, he's not that good a driver.

290
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,100
- Uh-huh.
- A-ha!

291
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,477
Going to leave the big boy behind?

292
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,905
[Tires screeching]

293
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,541
What are you doing?
Why are we slowing down?

294
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,960
It's no use.
We can't lose them this way.

295
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,755
The inside of my stomach...

296
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,147
What's that idiot in the truck doing?

297
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,483
What's he doin' back there?

298
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,486
I bet he's running out of gas. Good!

299
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,453
[Man] What happened to you?

300
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,456
- Having trouble with your engine?
- Run out of gas?

301
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,877
- What, you bend your tailpipe?
- No. It was just one of my tires.

302
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,671
I thought...

303
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,549
Shucks! Okay, so I was trying to...

304
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,633
Rats.

305
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,261
This whole thing...
I think we're making a big mistake.

306
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,638
- I absolutely agree.
- So?

307
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,890
We're being silly
running around like this.

308
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,476
- Sure. We're getting nowhere.
- By george, he's right.

309
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,730
Let's do something sensible.
Let's just discuss this thing...

310
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,357
...and reason something out.
- I'm with you.

311
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,444
And we can come to some conclusion
like intelligent people.

312
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,404
- Let's do that: What he said.
- [Horn honking]

313
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,699
Yeah. That way nobody will have an
advantage on one another, right?

314
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,034
It's fair.

315
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,869
We'd better get the cars off that curve.

316
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,913
Let's not talk here, but over there.
There's plenty of room.

317
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,582
Fine, see you over there.

318
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,876
Over there.

319
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,213
You're through to Homicide.

320
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,426
Santa Rosita Police Station...

321
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,178
...Detective Division.

322
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,598
I'm connecting you now.
Santa Rosita Police Station.

323
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,600
Detective Division. Matthews.

324
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,771
No, Sheriff, the Chief isn't here.
He's a little late this morning.

325
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,273
I'll stay late after school. Who is it?

326
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,734
- Sheriff, Crockett County.
- Who?

327
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,612
- That's where the Smiler is.
- I wonder if anything happened.

328
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,365
Gertie, will you put
that call through here?

329
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,575
How about some coffee, Schwartz?

330
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,668
Hello, Sheriff. Culpeper.

331
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,879
What'd he do, make a break?
What happened?

332
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,964
Afraid I got some bad news.

333
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,218
- Grogan's cashed in his chips.
- He what?

334
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,429
[Man] He crashed his car
about 20 minutes ago.

335
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,681
He was making a break, all right.

336
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,435
How did it happen?
Where did it happen?

337
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:22,775
On 39, about 18 miles east
of Danby Junction.

338
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:27,154
- Nine miles west of Valley Center.
- Were there any witnesses?

339
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,865
[Man] A few people went down
to see if they could help.

340
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,160
- Was he killed outright?
- I don't know, but I can find out.

341
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,121
[Culpeper] Do that. See what they said.

342
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,164
Thanks very much, Sheriff.

343
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,504
Well...

344
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,507
It's a great way to start the day.

345
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,760
You wait for 15 years
to solve a really important case...

346
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,262
...and just when you...

347
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,013
[shouts]

348
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,768
It's all right, Chief.
I'll get it for you.

349
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,731
He did it again.

350
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,958
[Laughs]

351
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,335
[Culpeper] Get that fella's number!
Get his number!

352
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,880
Get that fella's number!
Get his number!

353
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,300
[Siren wailing]

354
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,723
[Man on radio] Item: One large furniture
van. Item: One red Volkswagen.

355
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,100
That's them. Call in.

356
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,769
2-1-6-2, 2-1-5-8.

357
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,564
We just made all four of them
parked alongside the road.

358
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,233
They're standing there talking. Over.

359
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:50,488
[Man on radio] Sammy, let that ambulance
go. And stay by the radio.

360
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:55,242
The man said there was a certain amount
of money buried in this park.

361
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,452
Under a big W.

362
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,162
What is a big W?

363
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,080
We find out, we'll send you a wire.

364
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,582
[Laughs]

365
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,044
It's only a possibility
that this man was telling the truth.

366
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:10,591
If it was the truth, then it is a fact
this place is almost 200 miles away.

367
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,052
I suggest we quietly get
into our cars...

368
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,306
...and drive down there
at a safe, sound speed...

369
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,850
...keeping in sight of each other.

370
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,812
When we get there, we dig up the money,
providing there is money...

371
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,274
...and if we do find it, we share it
amongst us in a simple manner.

372
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,068
He's got a point. He's got something.

373
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,279
- We should go straight to the police.
- The police? Why?

374
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,534
It's all right, she's with us.
What's this "fair shares for everybody"?

375
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,372
We arrived in four vehicles. I think
we should split it up in four quarters.

376
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,167
Four quarters?
What are you talking about? Quarters?

377
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,712
You mean you three each get a quarter
and we have to split a quarter?

378
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,215
- That's right.
- What are you trying to pull?

379
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,385
- Seems fair to me.
- Naturally, it's fair to you.

380
00:25:54,553 --> 00:26:00,266
- It just cheats us, that's all.
- $350,000 divided by four is...

381
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,018
[mutters]... let's say, $87,500.

382
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,687
That's what it is.

383
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,232
The three of you get $87,500
and Benjy and I have to split.

384
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,694
There was five of us down at the wreck.
We should split it five ways.

385
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,903
He's right. We should.

386
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,656
I'm perfectly willing to discuss it
in a five-way manner.

387
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,492
We can discuss it in a five-way manner,
five shares...

388
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,828
...each share would be $70,000...

389
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,621
$70,000?

390
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,831
Holy mackerel!

391
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:28,002
You realize how many loads
I'd have to haul from Modesto to Yuma...

392
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,587
You're overlooking one thing.

393
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,755
- We're overlooking...
- What little thing?

394
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,174
- What little thing?
- We can all count.

395
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,760
- There were eight of us.
- There were eight of us.

396
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,597
Speaking for my wife and myself,
we'd be just as happy...

397
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,309
Happy with two-eighths instead
of a quarter? Awfully big of you.

398
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,395
Wait a minute, hold it.
Put it back the way it was before.

399
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,772
Either one quarter for each car,

400
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,900
including the van,
or one fifth for each guy.

401
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:56,614
- Because this old bag has to stick...
- How dare you!

402
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,285
Chief, we got a situation here
that is absolutely incredible.

403
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,538
- Look, Smiler Grogan... Remember him?
- Yes.

404
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,374
Smiler Grogan spent the night here, see?

405
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,627
Made his break this morning.

406
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:14,173
He drove up this way, got to here,
crashed and killed himself.

407
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,718
But before he died,
some people stopped to help him.

408
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,013
They are now stopped here, talking.

409
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,224
I think they're arguing about something.

410
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:28,729
And a Crockett County unit
has got them under observation.

411
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,982
We give shares to everybody
and for everything.

412
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,068
Now, there are eight of us.

413
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,071
There's eight shares for that.
Then there were four vehicles.

414
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,407
If we give four shares for that,
that's 12 shares already.

415
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,743
There were five of us
who went down to the wreck.

416
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,411
We give five shares for that.

417
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,288
That makes it 17, right?

418
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,290
Now, 17 shares and then we add...

419
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,293
...the same number of shares
as people in each vehicle.

420
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,755
Three for your group, two for yours,
two for us, and one for you.

421
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,424
That adds up to 25 shares.

422
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:02,763
25 into 350,000 is $14,000 per share.

423
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,640
Figured like that would mean...

424
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,102
...you'd get three shares for being
three people, one for the car...

425
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,854
...one share for going down
and looking at the wreck...

426
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,482
...and three for being
three more people in the car.

427
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:18,570
A total of eight shares,
giving you $112,000.

428
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,157
That should cover everything,
including the emancipation of women.

429
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,450
Let's see now.

430
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,704
I got one share for being one person...

431
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,290
...one share for going down the hill,
one share for the truck...

432
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,127
...one share for being a person
in the truck.

433
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:38,757
But no matter how you figure it out, I
still don't get as much as anybody else.

434
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,051
Let me explain it once more.

435
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:46,265
Their group, they, those three of them,
they get $112,000, right?

436
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,685
Those over there, them,
they get $97,000.

437
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,312
We, us, we get $84,000.

438
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,775
And you, by yourself,
you get $56,000...

439
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,818
...alone.

440
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,988
- That's tax-free money.
- What do you mean, tax-free?

441
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:05,117
If we go down to this park
and we uncover the money...

442
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,995
I'm sure he's not going
to declare anything.

443
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,997
I know he's not going
to declare anything.

444
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,668
- I'm not going to declare...
- What are you talking about, declare it?

445
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,421
I mean, it's like non-taxable income.

446
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,715
It's like a gift.

447
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,218
If we find the money,
we still have to report the taxes.

448
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,180
Otherwise, it's like stealing
from the government.

449
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,515
[Mutters] You explain it to him, please.

450
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,893
Who me?

451
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,813
If we find the money,
there may not be taxes to pay on it...

452
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,523
...because we found it.

453
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,611
- What he was trying to say is...
- Everybody has to pay taxes.

454
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,990
Even businessmen that rob,
steal and cheat people every day...

455
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,825
...even they have to pay taxes.

456
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,621
I give up. Anybody got a better,
fairer plan, go ahead.

457
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,666
There were eight of us there,
so that simply means eight shares.

458
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,628
- Three for us, two for you...
- This is hopeless.

459
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,881
We'll get no place if we continue
listening to this old bag.

460
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,635
Lady, you trying to split us up
so every man's for himself?

461
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,220
And every woman for himself?

462
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,055
One more funny remark from you...

463
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,225
- Let's get out of here.
- Please, don't argue anymore.

464
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,686
We figured it 17 different ways.

465
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,064
Every time we figured it,
it was no good.

466
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,818
No matter how we figured it,
somebody didn't like it.

467
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,196
Now there's only one way to figure it.

468
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,073
And that is, every man...

469
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,867
...including the old bag, for himself!

470
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,079
- Good luck and may the best man win!
- Right!

471
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,250
Except you, lady.
May you just drop dead!

472
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,585
All right. We all agree on that.

473
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:43,757
Let's be sensible about this thing.
There's money in this for all of us.

474
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,094
There's enough for you.
There's enough for you...

475
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,805
...for me...

476
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,099
...and for you...

477
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,934
...and there's enough for...

478
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,187
Melville, my shoe!

479
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,106
Get in the car!

480
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:32,222
[Man] 2-1-5-8, 2-1-6-2, four cars under
observation are passing this checkpoint.

481
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,224
Lead car is Plymouth station wagon.

482
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,226
Next, the Ford van, the Volkswagen...

483
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,146
...and the Chrysler Imperial
convertible, all doing about 50.

484
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,356
Yep, they're on their way.

485
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,400
[Culpeper] All traveling
in the same direction?

486
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,193
Right. According to my boys...

487
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,238
...they're all
on reckless driving charges already.

488
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:52,993
None of those people must suspect
that anybody's interested in them.

489
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,537
Now, Sheriff,
will you get on to Capt. Hardesty...

490
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,123
...and see how many helicopters
he can let us have?

491
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,793
I'll see what we can do
and I'll call you back.

492
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,840
Now, where have I always told you
that the Smiler hid the dough?

493
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,926
- I know.
- Where?

494
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,512
- Right there.
- That's right, yeah.

495
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,515
If these merrymakers
decide to go for it...

496
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,560
...they'll go to the crossroads
and turn south.

497
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,022
But why did Smiler head east
when he made his break...

498
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,358
...if the money is down here somewhere?

499
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,734
- Oh!
- [Chuckles]

500
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:30,197
Aloysius, the guy is just being clever.
You can't...

501
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,449
5 will get you 10...

502
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,536
...they turn south at the crossroads.
- You got yourself a bet.

503
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,298
[Tires screeching]

504
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,886
"Mount Shasta National Forest."
Are we near...

505
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,681
That's on the top!
Look down near the bottom.

506
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,310
- Are we near Oregon?
- That's 700 miles from here.

We've got the Imperial
and we're running last?

512
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,303
I can't pass them on the curves.

513
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,098
Go on. Go ahead. Look, there's a space!

514
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,184

I said it before and I'll say it again.

I didn't want to move to California.

522
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,804
- Did you find it yet?
- I can't find it anywhere.

523
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,514
Take the wheel. Give me the map.

524
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,557
Take the wheel! Give me the map.

525
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,977
It must be here.
Right over here. Valley Center!

526
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,270
It's right here.

527
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,022
There's an airfield not far...

- [both yelling]
- Get it off your face!

529
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,947
- Get it off me!
- Don't go in there!

530
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,366

- They're going to hire airplanes.
- Never mind. Go!

00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,854
- But they'll be there hours before...
- I said never mind. Let's go!

No. They wanted every man for himself.

We got dust in the carburetor.

00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,442
When the people who own this see this,
I sure hate to think...

543
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,736
Never mind.

544
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,904
Here's the bike.

545
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,948
Get to the nearest phone
and hire the best car you can find.

546

I got to admit...

551
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,800
...I feel kind of silly.

552
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,719
You know what I mean?

553
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,855
Will you take us or won't you?

554

For $250, I guess I will.

00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,237
You take care of the plane.
We'll leave our car here till tomorrow.

- I'll give you a check.
- Check?

557
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,158
Traveler's check from
the Bank of America. Don't worry.

558
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,744
- Oh, boy.
- Hey!

559
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,372
Are you a pilot?
Is there a plane around?

560
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,539
Right both times.

561
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,792
Where's an airplane? I don't see any.

562
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,835
There's only one. We've chartered it.

563
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,672
- So you and your friend...
- Did you make a deal with them?

564
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,008
- Right.
- Where can we charter another plane?

565
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,886
- Nearest place is North Valley.
- Where's that?

about 12 miles, 15 miles.

- Excuse us.
- Filibuster, filibuster.

you how much in front of your wife.

- Good morning.
- Had an accident?

- Anyone hurt?
- No, but we've got to get to a phone.

Of course, I should be
absolutely delighted.

caught me on the hub there.

- I'm most frightfully sorry.

of desert flora.

00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,291
It certainly is. We're in a hurry.
We've got to get to a phone.

Of course, with pleasure.

Jolly lucky nobody was hurt.

Where did you get that funny accent?
Are you from Harvard or something?

589
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,136
Harvard? Rather not. I'm English.

590
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,013

gathering some for my collection.

Yes. Whoosh-whoosh.

Keep moving!

00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,052
Can't we go on our second honeymoon
and forget all about this?

Honey, please, darling.
Believe me, everything is all right.

617
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,891
Do you think I'd take a chance with you

618
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,977
if there was any danger
in flying this thing?

619
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,104
This plane is really built.

620
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,898
When was this plane built?

621
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,110
1916.

622
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:51,281
1916. These planes are tried and true.

623
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,033
There's nothing experimental
about these planes.

624
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,162
So, come on.
Let's have one big adventure.

Are you sure you can't rent us
that truck? I'll pay.

631

I told you, we can't.

How could we do without our truck?

633

We're in business.

634
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:46,336
We'll have to speak to the Englishman.
If we tell him what happened...

635
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,046
How can you admit we're involved...

636
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:52,091
- He'll say he's entitled to a share.
- He would be if he drove us there.

637
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,261
If we don't tell him, he won't.

638
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,223
You're such a genius.

639

Listen! Only 10 percent!

640

There's no reason
he should expect any more!

641
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,701
Thanks for stopping.
Can you give me a lift?

642
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,872
What's with the kiddy bicycle?
Are you some kind of a nut?

643
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,251
No. I had an accident.
I got to get to Santa Rosita fast.

644
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,836
Can't help you.
I'm turning off a little way up.

645
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,130
Wait, let me think.

646
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,759
I got to tell somebody.
Could you spare a couple of hours?

You're starting to crack up.

650
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,102
Just hear me out.

651
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,565
What I'm gonna tell you, you just ain't
going to believe it could've happened.

652
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,234
There was an accident here
a little while back...

653
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,321
...about 20 miles back.
It involved $350,000.

00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,490
Now, like I say...

655
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:01,744
...when I tell you this, you just ain't
going to believe it could've happened.

What bothers me is this big W.

You sure you told me all you know?
You don't know what that guy meant?

661
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:57,050
No, none of them know.
It's just who gets there first.

662
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,427
What do you say? Is it a deal?

663

Um... Deal!

664
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,476

that bike out of there.

Fellas, I'm glad you're here.
Look, I need your help.

669
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,149
I had this blowout.
I think a spare's in the back.

670
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,736
It may be a little flat.
Is there an airport anyplace around?

671
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,655
If the spare's flat, don't fix it.
Give me a new tire.

672
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,657
You ain't got a new tire, fix the spare.

But don't look at me, move it.
You could be gassing up.

00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:52,290
What is it, a staring contest?
Move, move, will you? Come on!

675
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,876
The pension in my grade...

676
00:45:55,043 --> 00:46:00,631
...has not been upped
one red cent since 1934.

677
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,842
Now... Uh...

678
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,137
If the Mayor
will get behind a resolution...

679
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,848
What can I do?
I can't put any pressure on the Mayor!

680
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,808
You can, Al.

681
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,310
That's the whole point.

682
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,687
This case,
I'll have finished by tonight.

683
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:18,065
It's one of the biggest cases
we've ever had across our books.

684
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,193
Tell the Mayor about it.

685
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,864
Tell him the money is right here,
where I always said it was...

686
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,741
...right in this neighborhood.

687
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,536
Tell him what credit will be reflected
upon the department.

688
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:35,166
Come on, Aloysius,
get in there and pitch for me.

689
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,460
I can try.

690
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,879
He'll listen to you.

691
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:44,550
If he gets behind this,
it'll pass unanimously.

692
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,385
Now, you know...

693
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,596
You know, Al, I got it coming.

694
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,390
I'll do everything I can.

695
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,643
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

696
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,021
There's just one other little thing...

697
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,065
No. Nothing.

698
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,399
Vacation.

699
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:04,403
Once I get Smiler Grogan out of the way,
my desk is clear.

700
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:10,034
I'd like to take a three-week vacation.
Take Ginger on a real nice holiday.

701
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,870
- Is that all right with you?
- Of course it's all right.

702
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,706
Thanks. I can hardly wait to tell her.

703
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:18,709
- You won't forget about the Mayor?
- No.

704
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:22,421
I'll do my best. I promise you that.

705
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,216
Aloysius,
I'll never forget you for this.

706
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,177
You know something, Al?
I got a feeling this morning...

707
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,430
...that everything's coming my way.

708
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,599
[Chuckles]

709
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,607
Sylvester!

710
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:45,236
- [Tires screeching]
- [Mrs. Marcus screaming]

711
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,616
- Why did you do that?
- Why are you shouting?

712
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,411
- Do you have to scare everybody?
- Are you crazy?

713
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,787
Why didn't I think?

714
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,914
We've been running around like lunatics.

715
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,793
Why didn't I think about Sylvester?
He's sitting there right now.

716
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,880
- He lives on Silver Strand Beach.
- I never thought of that.

717
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,799
- Who on earth is Sylvester?
- My son, Emmeline's brother.

718
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,384
He's a lifeguard there.

719
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:12,054
I'm not entirely certain
that you haven't damaged this machine.

720
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:20,438
Kid, don't mind polishing.
I got a lot of cars. Don't bother.

721
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,356
You did a good job.

722
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,317
Have a drink on me. Keep the change.

723
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,277
I took care of your buddy.
Let me go now.

724
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,320
You!

725
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,781
No! It's that lunatic
who escaped from the asylum!

726
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,242
Watch him! He's a homicidal maniac!

727
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,494
Get on the phone, yell "Mayday."

728
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,413
Listen to me. I'm a psychiatrist.

729
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,082
This man is insane! I'm not your nurse.

730
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,500
He has a hate complex.

731
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,753
Calm down!

732
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,006
Somebody will stumble
over the bicycle in the dark, huh?

733
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:51,010
When I finish with you, they'll be
stumbling over you in the dark!

734
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,887
Get on the phone!

735
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,851
Look out!

736
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,520
- [Both shouting]
- Look, I was clowning.

737
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,607
Get out of here! Sir, wait a minute.

738
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,901
You've got this all...
Why don't you stop?

739
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,028
I tell you. I'll kill you!

740
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,030
[Shouting]

741
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,324
You got this... Wait!

742
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,368
- Don't take it so...
- [bell dinging]

743
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,120
Will you stop staring and get out of...

744
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,831
He's out of his head.

745
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,918
- He's crazy!
- Want us to call... Ray!

746
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,587
It's a brand-new pump!

747
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,882
- Get out of here!
- Stop that!

748
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,218
Stop that! He's crazy!

749
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,261
- [Glass shatters]
- Hey.

750
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,555
Very good. Quick thinking.
I'm proud of you.

751
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,516
Very good. Tie him up.

752
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,519
I'll have some orderlies come by
with a straitjacket.

753
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,397
- Very good. I'm proud of you.
- I never saw anything...

754
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,941
- How many people has he killed?
- There'll be more.

755
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,110
Tie him up for the boys
in the white jackets.

756
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,196
I'm proud of you, boys.
You did a real good job.

757
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,740
Look me up. I'm in the book.
Dr. Zillman.

758
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:00,079
- Sir, we've got to get to Santa Rosita.
- I tell you, this is a club.

759
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,373
We don't do charters.
Nobody here can take you.

760
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,419
- Whose plane is that?
- That belongs to Mr. Tyler Fitzgerald.

761
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,212
He isn't going anywhere today.

762
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,049
- Is he here? Can we see him?
- Mr. Fitzgerald's in the billiard room.

763
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:16,262
- He's asleep. Nobody can talk to him.
- Can we ask him a question?

764
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,264
- No, you can't.
- [Phone rings]

765
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,599
Hello? Wait a minute!

766
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:28,024
Come on, Benjy.
That must be Mr. Fitzgerald over there!

767
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,861
- You can't disturb Mr. Fitzgerald!
- We just want to talk to him.

768
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,946
- Let him rest, please.
- Hello.

769
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,197
- Sh!
- Don't shush me!

770
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,283
We're trying to talk to him.

771
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,368
Wake up, won't you please?

772
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,496
- [Snoring]
- I think he's got a cold.

773
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,624
Mr. Fitzgerald, listen. Please, sir.

774
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,336
We hate to disturb your sleep,
but it's an emergency.

775
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,464
You've no right to crash in here.

776
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,841
[Coughing, grunting]

777
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,259
That's a head cold.

778
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,928
Mr. Fitzgerald,
you know where Rosita Beach is?

779
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,807
- Only you can get us there.
- It's a matter of life and death.

780
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,726
Right, a matter of life and death.

781
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,645
- It's our grandmother. She's dying.
- Who's dying?

782
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,982
Our grandmother is dying
and she's sent for us.

783
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,487
She's in Rosita Beach.
She's dying and we're up here.

784
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,698
She'd like us with her when she goes.

785
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,825
Otherwise, she won't go.

786
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,329
- She'll go.
- Sir, they forced their way in here.

787
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,290
No, we didn't. Let me introduce myself.

788
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,334
I'm Dingy Bell. This is Benjy Benjamin.

789
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,170
- How do you do?
- Don't start with that!

790
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,673
Sir, we'd like you to help us out
by taking us down...

791
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,345
- What's the matter?
- Wait just a minute.

792
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,891
I can't see!
Something's happened to my eyes.

793
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,559
[Stammering] I can't see!

794
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,311
You can't see? He can't see.

795
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:51,357
- Must be an eye cold.
- George, I can't see.

796
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,860
- [George] One minute, Mr. Fitzgerald.
- I can't see! George!

797
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,195
George!

798
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,906
[Screaming]

799
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,074
Mr. Fitzgerald!

800
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,495
We want to make sure
he doesn't get loose.

801
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,999
I'll kill that dirty rotten bum...

802
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,002
...if I get my hands on him.
What's the matter?

803
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,046
How come I'm tied up like this?

804
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,549
Just sit there.
Everything will be all right.

805
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,218
Yeah. Friends are coming
to take care of you.

806
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,512
What friends?
What are you talking about?

807
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,556
Get this stuff off me. Turn me loose.

808
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,558
Take it easy. You've been sick.

809
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:29,436
Who's been sick?
And where's that bum with the glasses?

810
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,982
[Stammering] Now just sit still,
because the doctor is going...

811
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,986
What doctor? I don't know no doctor.
What are you guys, crazy or something?

812
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,822
I'm warning you.
Get this stuff off me, you understand?

813
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,992
- Get this stuff off me!
- Watch him, Ray, watch him!

814
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,996
I'm warning you!
I'm going to have to hit you again.

815
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,123
Ow!

816
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,584
My arm! You broke my arm!

817
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,420
[Grunting]

818
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:10,769
You keep this up
and I'm going to get sore.

819
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:20,613
Okay. That's the way you want it,
that's the way you're going to get it.

820
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,865
[Both shouting]

821
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,162
- I'll kill you!
- Whoo!

822
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,960
- Help! He's ruining our place!
- Come on, Ray!

823
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,557
- You better get out of here, mister!
- Leave us alone!

824
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,559
[Screaming]

825
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,149
- Uh-huh. There you are.
- What are we going to do?

826
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,488
Dr. Zillman! Dr. Zillman!

827
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,787
[Screaming]

828
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:18,879
Help! Put me down!
Put me down immediately!

829
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,466
[Screams]

830
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:26,512
- That's the way you want it?
- Help! Help!

831
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,019
[Shouting]

832
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,146
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

833
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,691
[Clattering, crashing]

834
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,697
You're getting out of line. I'm not
kidding. I've had all I can take.

835
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,533
Irwin, we'll have to kill him.

836
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,034
- Ready?
- Ready.

837
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,369
- Set?
- Set.

838
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,495
[Both] Charge!

[Trumpet fanfare]

840
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,130
He's going nuts! He's really nuts!

841
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,175
- Go away!
- You'd better get out of here!

842
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,053
I mean it, I don't want to...

843
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,684
What'll we do?

844
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,104
Go away!

845
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:26,363
[Screaming]

846
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,654
[Phone rattling]

847
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,366
[Phone ringing]

00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,118
# Got a baby who can give me 31 flavors

00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,787
# And we like tutti-frutti best

850
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:19,500
# I call him ice cream Joe
He is the most delicious boy I know

851
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,795
Go, baby, go! [laughs]

852
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,047
# He gives me 31 flavors

853
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,673
- # And we like tutti-frutti best
- Yeah, yeah!

854
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,636
- # I just love him so
- Yeah, yeah!

855
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:34,348
[Chuckles] Ah, yeah!

- [Laughs] Don't stop! Go!

861
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,949
Whoo!

862
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,909
[Phone rattling]

863
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,620
He's got to be home.

864
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,957
He never gets up this early.
Why doesn't he answer?

865
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,839
I hope you won't mind my asking,
but what sort of chap...

866
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,674
...is this brother-in-law of yours?

867
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,509
He's a nut. Why?

868
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,720
I hope he's nothing like
my brother-in-law. Peculiar chap.

869
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,848
Secretary of a golf club
out near Pangbourne.

870
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,224
So what about him?

871
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,853
I was thinking that if Reggie,
my brother-in-law...

872
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,356
If Reggie got hold of information
like this information...

873
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,900
...it's likely that would be
the last time...

874
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:30,696
...anyone would ever see or hear
of dear old Reggie. [chuckles]

875
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:36,368
I doubt very much whether old Reggie
will be waiting for us in Santa Rosita.

876
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,996
Cheers.

877
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,376
[Man shouting]

878
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,545
Tyler! Tyler's probably
still in the shower.

879
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:50,466
Tyler! There he is! Tyler!

880
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,885
- Tyler!
- You promised!

881
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,888
Hey! I'll wake him up. Tyler!

882
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,682
- Tyler!
- Huh? Huh?!

883
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,811
- Wake up! Come on now!
- [Mumbling]

884
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,230
- Get out of here!
- Wait!

885
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,857
Ah!

886
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,400
Mr. Fitzgerald!

[Rattling]

888
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,909
You think I'll sit still
while some un-American foreigner...

889
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,870
...makes accusations about
my own flesh and blood?

890
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,164
We'll see about that. Stop this car!

891
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,415
[Tires screech]

892
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,001
- Really, madam.
- Mother, this is awful!

893
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,587
- So we'll see!
- Mother, what are you doing?

894
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,590
You don't trust your brother-in-law?
Let me tell you something.

895
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,426
If my boy is out, then everybody is out.
So we'll see.

896
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,596
We don't even own the car
and you have no right to do what you do.

897
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:42,726
Rights? You talk to me about rights?

898
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:43,936
Mother...

899
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:46,813
You address me on the subject of rights?

900
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,277
Trouble? Having any trouble?

901
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,739
Yes! And we don't need
any help from you.

902
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,372
Well!

903
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,998
- Mother, please.
- Ah!

904
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,750
With all due respect, this is too much.

905
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,336
Give Mr. Hawthorne the keys
or we'll never get there.

906
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,420
Too bad.

907
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:14,550
Madam, I must say I find your attitude
somewhat less than helpful.

908
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:18,428
And what's all this got to do with you,
if you don't mind telling me?

909
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:22,140
If we have quite decided
to withdraw from this affair...

910
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:26,979
...you might be expected to hand me back
my keys so that I could press on.

911
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:31,358
You keep out of this!
Are we calling Sylvester or not?

912
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,069
No!

913
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,323
We are not. And I'll tell you why.
Because your son, Sylvester...

914
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:42,661
...is an irresponsible, unreliable,
big loudmouth, no-good bum...

915
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,997
...who, if he isn't a crook,
it's only because...

916
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,125
...he hasn't got the brains or ambition
even to become a crook.

917
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,293
Good show!

918
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,005
If you want to come, you can.
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

919
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:56,967
But you've got to give us those keys or
you'll force us to take them from you!

920
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,468
Here, here.

921
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,312
Give us those keys.
Give us those keys.

922
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,480
I don't care where you have them.
I'll get them.

923
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:13,025
- How dare you.
- Give us those keys.

924
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,403
- You take one more step towards me...
- I'll take another step.

925
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,865
I'm warning you.
You're gonna be sorry!

926
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,868
- Give me the keys.
- You're gonna get it, but good!

927
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,953
- Ah!
- Oof!

928
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:28,206
- Emmeline!
- Emmeline, stay in the car!

929
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,751
Grab her!

930
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,669
[All shouting]

931
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:36,089
Russell, don't! Mother!

932
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:39,217
- Put me down!
- Must be stuck.

933
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:42,638
Russell, you wouldn't.
You couldn't! You shouldn't!

934
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,390
Let me go! Let me get out of here!

935
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,810
I got 'em! Here they are.

936
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:53,482
We really didn't want to do it.
But that was the only way. Upsy-daisy.

937
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,235
Don't hit him. Ow!

938
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,741
Madam, please! Please!

939
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,618
You forced us. You forced us.

940
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,037
I'm willing to say I'm sorry,
but you forced us.

941
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:11,041
- Do us a favor and get back in the car.
- Get away from me! Don't you touch me!

942
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,086
- We had to do it. You saw it, honey.
- Russell, let me go.

943
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,672
Just wait.
You can't manhandle a decent woman.

944
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,341
You're going to jail!
You'll be arrested for assault.

945
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:23,261
I'm going to sue for everything you've
got. Take your hands off my daughter!

946
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,847
I say, if we are going,
we really must get cracking.

947
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,182
Russell, how could you?

948
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,059
- You know we had to...
- Mr. Finch!

949
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:33,271
Please don't go. We'll be right
with you. See, she made us do it.

950
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,565
Let's forget the whole thing
and be reasonable.

951
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:38,652
- Please get back in the car.
- Not me!

952
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,738
We are wasting so much time.
Give me the keys.

953
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,033
[Engine sputtering]

954
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,292
[Car horn honking]

955
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,549
The cars are going faster than we are.

956
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,759
Can't you make this thing
go a little faster?

957
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:06,972
Wide open, I can.
But wide open eats up a lot of gas.

958
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,808
Then open up wide. I'll pay for the gas.

959
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,562
- It'll cost you about $50.
- Okay, I'll pay when we land.

960
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,856
- Now!
- I got to pay now?

961
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:19,067
- Now!
- All right, I'll pay you now.

962
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,569
- Melville...
- What?

963
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,696
A bug! Get him off! [screams]

964
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:26,491
Get him off! There he is! Get him!

965
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,703
- You're breaking up the airplane!
- Is it down there?

966
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,329
[Shouting]

967
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,457
- Now you're breaking the floor!
- [Metal tearing]

968
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,333
- [Melville] Help!
- [Monica] Melville!

969
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,754
None of these 10 people
have any record at all.

970
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,673
And we're ready to book 'em
for withholding information...

971
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,676
...causing accidents,
failing to report accidents...

972
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:48,597
...reckless driving, theft, at least
three cases of assault and battery...

973
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,640
- Capt. Culpeper?
- Yeah.

974
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,726
- That my home?
- Yes, sir.

975
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,812
Uh, Sheriff, excuse me. Another call.

976
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,274
Take the Sheriff. I'll take it in here.

977
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,985
Freddy, transfer Mrs. Culpeper
to Culpeper's office.

978
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:08,575
- Hello, Ginger?
- [Girl] Daddy, it's Billie Sue.

979
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,703
Oh. Let me speak with
your mother, sweetheart.

980
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,082
[Woman] Well?

981
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,460
Ah, dear.

982
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,172
Tell me something, Ginger.
How does it feel being married...

983
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,092
...to the most brilliant personality
in the law enforcement industry?

984
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,637
[Ginger] Are you referring to yourself?

985
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,974
Ginger, I want you to prepare yourself
for a little shock.

986
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,227
When I tell you what has happened...

987
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:38,230
[Ginger] So tell me.
I've got this biscuit dough...

988
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:41,817
The Smiler Grogan case is solved.

989
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,568
[Ginger] The what?

990
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:47,989
What the hell is the Smiler Grogan case?

991
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,953
The tuna factory robbery.

992
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,748
The case I've been talking about
for the last 15 years.

993
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:01,378
All I want you to do
is make all the preparations...

994
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,506
...for a little flight to Hawaii,
Sunday morning.

995
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,425
- [Ginger] So what's the gag?
- It is no gag.

996
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,929
[Ginger] Are you serious
about flying to Hawaii?

997
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,430
[Chuckles]

998
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:15,225
Flight 7, Sunday morning.

999
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,936
- [Ginger] Are we taking Billie Sue?
- No!

1000
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,189
Just the two of us
for about three weeks.

1001
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,567
Now, we're going to celebrate, Ginger.

1002
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,237
My feeling is that after 27 years...

1003
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,240
...we've earned it.

1004
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,962
[Tires screeching]

1005
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:47,883
What's the matter?

1006
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,218
- I need help. Can you give me a lift?
- What?

1007
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,263
My wife is sick.
The doc sent me out for some medicine.

1008
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,347
All right. Come on.

1009
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,474
- I just ran out of gas.
- Get in!

1010
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:12,949
- You?
- You?

1011
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,659
Wait a minute. We're in trouble.

1012
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,162
Everybody's in trouble.
Get out of the way.

1013
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,664
You think we wanted
to leave you back there?

1014
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,166
It was my son-in-law
and that Englishman.

1015
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,668
What Englishman? Get out of the way.

1016
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:27,547
You leave us here,
and you know what you're going to get?

1017
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,799
Nothing! We'll get it all.

1018
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:30,926
How will you do that?

1019
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,970
I'll call my son. He lives
about 10 miles from Rosita Beach.

1020
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:38,350
He'll drive there and get the money
and we're going to have it. That's how!

1021
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:41,811
I was going to offer you a share
for taking us to a phone.

1022
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:45,607
But because you're not interested,
we'll wait for another car.

1023
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,400
We're making a terrible mistake.

1024
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,444
We should go back
and get my mother-in-law.

1025
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,904
- Go back?
- Yes.

1026
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,238
You couldn't be serious.

1027
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:56,284
All she has to do is get to a telephone,
my brother-in-law will get there first.

1028
01:05:56,452 --> 01:06:00,538
They'll get all and we won't get a dime.
You can believe that.

1029
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,377
[Stammers] But look here.

1030
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:08,755
Even if she does get all the money,
this won't make any difference...

1031
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,925
...to our agreement.
She wouldn't break her word.

1032
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:16,805
I mean to say, I'd still be entitled
to 10 percent as agreed. Surely.

1033
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:20,517
Surely. Come on, let's go.

01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:50,755

slimy bum that double-crossed me.

1037
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:54,009
When I get a hold of that smart aleck,
what I'm going to do...

1038
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,928
If you're there, I hope you turn away...

1039
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,764

that you just look the other way.

1041
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,269
Did you get him?

1042
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,771
Maybe he went out
for the papers or something.

1043
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:08,898
We can keep on trying.

1044
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:13,403
Just supposing we never do get him?
We might be the last ones there.

1045
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,295
Just a minute. Down there?

1046
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,047
You're kidding. It's too steep.

1047
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,883
I drive my jeep down here every day.
Let's go!

Yeah, let's go. Let's...

1050
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,739
You can turn around here.
I sure appreciate this, mister. Thanks.

I got to get out of here.

1056
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,389
Will you ask your father to show me?
There must be some other way out!

1057
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,474
Come on! Hurry up!

1058
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,817
I could show you a way out.
There's another way to the road.

1059
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:20,113
You know another way to the road?
Good. Come on in. Don't stand there.

1060
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,449
If you show me the way out,
I'll give you $1.

- Hm... $3.
- $3? Why, you...

1062

Yeah, all right. I'll give you $3.

- They're not here.
- Probably got a lift.

1066
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:51,352
We only passed six or seven cars
and they weren't in them.

1067
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,396
Somebody must have
taken them the other way.

1068
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,065
I think we better go back
to that place we phoned from.

1069

What? That's miles
in the wrong direction.

1070
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,445
Besides, we can't be certain
they'll be there.

1071

I don't know, I must find my wife.
And I don't know what to do.

is for the two of us to press on.

For all we know, your brother-in-law
may be out or away somewhere.

No. We'll leave them where they are.
See what happens.

1166
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:35,613
Watch all the exits,
but render no assistance. Over.

1167
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,868
Are you happy?

1168
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:49,085
[Grunting]

1169
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,393
I need a drink.

1170
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,896
There's some ice and stuff back there.
Make us all some Old Fashioneds.

1171
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,232
You think you ought to drink
while you're flying?

1172
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,401
Stop kidding and make us some drinks.

1173
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,654
Just press the button back there
marked "booze."

1174
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,449
It's the only way to fly. [chuckles]

1175
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:21,867
[Chuckles nervously]

1176
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,134
Estimated speed 175.

1177
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,344
We'll never be able to keep up with him.

1178
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:43,764
Better have some of the other units
intercept. Over.

1179
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,476
Hello, Ginger?
What's the matter now?

1180
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:50,896
[Ginger] It's Billie Sue.
Her new boyfriend Oscar...

1181
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:54,400
...was supposed to come down
from Pomona just to meet us.

1182
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:57,236
So now she told him
we were going away.

1183
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:58,821
What? What's the matter?

1184
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:02,575
[Ginger] You keep forgetting.
If a girl is 6 feet 5 inches tall...

1185
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:04,869
...she's bound to have special problems.

1186
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,912
- But, Ginger...
- [Ginger] They had some argument...

1187
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:07,997
Get out!

1188
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,958
[Ginger]... screaming at each other.
Now the whole engagement's off...

1189
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,918
...and she says she's leaving.

1190
01:17:13,086 --> 01:17:15,504
Leaving what? Leaving home?

1191
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:17,673
Let me talk to her.
Get her to the phone.

1192
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:20,426
[Ginger] I'll try. Just a minute.
Talk to your father.

1193
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,346
[Billie Sue] I won't.
I don't want to talk to him ever.

1194
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:27,391
[Ginger] Don't be ridiculous.
Whatever else he is, he is your father.

1195

Ah!

[Phone rings]

1201
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,566
[Ringing continues]

1202
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:23,280
Ooh! Yeah! Ah!

1203
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,869
[Groans] Oh!

[Exhales]

1205
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,666
You hear bells, baby?

[Ringing continues]

1207
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:39,255
Yes?

1208
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:42,425
- [Mrs. Marcus] Who is that?
- Who's that?

1209
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,218
I want my son! Hey!

1210
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:50,474
Who is that?
I want to speak to Sylvester Marcus.

1211
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:53,561
- Sylvester?
- Yeah, baby?

1212
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,689
- It's your mom.
- [Chuckles]

1213
01:18:56,857 --> 01:19:01,318
Ah! [laughs] Good old Mom. Hello!

1214
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:03,946
- Sylvester?
- [Sylvester] Is that you, Mom?

1215
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,741
Of course it's me.
I've been trying you all morning.

1216
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:09,493
I've been a little busy.

1217
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:12,329
I've been working
and I didn't hear the phone.

1218
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:14,457
Hold on a minute, will you, Mom?

1219
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:18,252
Baby, how about a beer or something?
Man, I feel like...

1220
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,629
Will you listen?
Something's happened.

1221
01:19:20,797 --> 01:19:24,091
[Mrs. Marcus] There was an accident this
morning. A man got killed!

1222
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,342
Who got killed?

1223
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:27,178
- [Mrs. Marcus] Now, listen!
- You all right?

1224
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:28,804
- [Mrs. Marcus] Pay attention!
- Sis all right?

1225
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:30,598
- [Mrs. Marcus] Will you listen?
- What's wrong?

1226
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,183
[Mrs. Marcus] Can you hear me?

1227
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,101
There's a whole fortune in cash.

1228
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,605
You can get it before anybody else,
but you've got to hurry!

1229
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,858
What's the matter? What's going on
there? Are you all right?

1230
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:43,694
Of course I'm all right. Sylvester!

1231
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,112
Are Russell and Emmeline with you?

1232
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,283
Forget about Russell.
Will you shut up and let me talk?

1233
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,827
What's going on? Where's Russell?

1234
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:53,996
Don't even mention Russell!

1235
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:57,500
- When I tell you what Russell did...
- Just tell him about the dough.

1236
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:59,001
Keep out of this! Shut up!

1237
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,712
- [Mrs. Marcus] Don't talk. Just listen.
- What did Russell do?

1238
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,508
He assaulted me, if you wanna know!
He grabbed me beside the road.

1239
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:08,052
He and this Englishman
I don't even know!

1240
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,554
Who's with you and where are you?

1241
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:14,683
I'm with this truck driver
in Peterson's Garage in Plaster City.

1242
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:17,186
Will you shut up a minute
so I can tell you what happened?

1243
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:21,857
Listen to me close! Stay there,
'cause I'm coming to get you right now.

1244
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:22,983
Shut up and listen!

1245
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,862
Everything's going to be all right.
Your baby's coming to get you.

1246
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,240
- Sit there. Relax. Take it easy.
- [Mrs. Marcus] Sylvester!

Well?

1249
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:42,628
So he's coming here,
and I'm not to worry about a thing.

1250
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,840
Because everything
is going to be all right.

The burglar alarm.

1253
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:57,685
We just throw it on, people hear it,
they come, and we're out.

1254
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,229
Don't be frightened
if it makes a big bell noise.

1255
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,606
Okay? All right? Here we go.

1256

- I don't hear anything.
- Neither do I. There's no bell.

Look at it. It just stands there.

1258

1262
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:43,314
The stupidest burglar in the world
could come in...

1263
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:46,233
...and walk away with everything,
and we can't even get out.

1264
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:49,153
Sheesh! [grunting]

1265
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:51,155

and somebody comes...

1269
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,922
...what about the damage?

1270
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:12,343
They're the ones who locked us in!

1271
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,513

- Nonsense. Anybody can fly a plane.

I'll check you out.
Put your little hands on the wheel.

That's it. Now you have it.
Now the feet on the rudder.

What can happen
to an Old Fashioned, all right?

1291
01:23:23,206 --> 01:23:26,458
I know you don't know what to do,
so don't do nothing.

1292
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:30,754

Ease back on her!

- I'm easing.
- Ease back a little!

- I'm trying my best.
- All kidding aside...

I'm not kidding any longer.
It's making me...

pull yourself together.

01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:52,312
[Engine droning]

1331
01:25:57,652 --> 01:26:00,279
- Hello. Hello there.
- Don't shut the motor off!

1332
01:26:00,446 --> 01:26:03,782
I'm not shutting anything off!
Hello, anybody! Can anybody hear me?

1333
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,703
- I can hear you!
- I don't care if you hear me!

1334
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:08,745
Look, I wanna be...

1335
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:11,999
- I don't know whether we're on the air.
- Mayday. Call mayday!

1336
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:16,253
Mayday! Mayday, we're up here!
Can you hear us? Help!

1337
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:20,757
- Benjy, say something.
- Help! Ah!

1338
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,385
Hello? Billie Sue?

1339
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:26,263
- Billie Sue, where are you?
- [Billie Sue] I'm at the bus station.

1340
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,932
I only called because
Mommy said I absolutely...

1341
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:32,853
Now, sweetie, what are you doing
in the bus station?

1342
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,022
[Billie Sue] I'm waiting for the bus.

1343
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,192
- Your wife's on the other phone.
- [Billie Sue sobbing]

1344
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:42,112
Ginger?
I've got Billie Sue on the other line.

1345
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,781
Billie Sue, wait one minute, will you?

1346
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:46,950
- Ginger?
- [Ginger] I'm here.

1347
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:49,661
Can you hear Billie Sue?
She's crying.

1348
01:26:49,829 --> 01:26:50,787
[Ginger] Billie Sue!

1349
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:52,831
She's in the bus station
and she's crying,

1350
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:54,666
but she's waiting for you to tell her.

1351
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:57,377
- [Ginger] Billie Sue!
- Are you listening?

1352
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:58,629
[Ginger] Billie?

1353
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:01,882
- Are you listening to your mother?
- [Ginger] Your mother is speaking.

1354
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,968
- Listen to your mother, sweetie.
- [Ginger] Billie Sue!

1355
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:07,429
Billie Sue! Listen to your mother!

1356
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:15,437
Everything that's happened
to my daughter and me today...

1357
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:18,565
...only happened for one reason:
Because you were too stupid...

1358
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,526
...to look where you were going,
and wrecked our car!

1359
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:25,989
- Oh, yeah?
- [Brakes squealing]

1360
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:36,500
You either get out of that truck
or I'm going to throw you out.

1361
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,210
Don't get upset.

1362
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:41,797
You're not going to do anything.
Drive on, you big, stupid idiot.

1363
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:47,511
[Sobbing] Mommy, don't worry.
Your baby's coming to save you!

1364
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:54,810
Oh! Mr. Pike! Mr. Pike, please!

1365
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:58,689
- Let me go! Get away from me!
- That isn't nice a bit!

1366
01:27:58,856 --> 01:28:03,318
- Mother!
- [All shouting]

1367
01:28:03,486 --> 01:28:05,779
[Mrs. Marcus shouting] Help me!

1368
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:13,495
[All shouting]

1369
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:17,124
That's what I'm here for.
That's why you had me, to save you.

1370
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,709
[Mrs. Marcus screaming]

1371
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:21,295
Help me! Ah!

1372
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:24,214
Emmeline! Ah!

1373
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,718
Yeah, yeah. [laughs]

1374
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:30,345
It's practically burned through.

1375
01:28:30,513 --> 01:28:33,515
Just a couple blows
with the sledgehammer and we're out.

1376
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:40,939
Ah!

1377
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:45,319
Eh...

1378
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,208
Hey! Wait a minute!

1379
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:02,627
I can't cross here!

1380
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:06,631
You said the main road.
This is Niagara Falls.

1381
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:09,343
All right, look. You're a little boy.

1382
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,804
If you want to be a big boy,
which way to the main road?

1383
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,065
Don't!

1384
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:25,776
It's no! The answer is no.

1385
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:29,613
He won't back any increase in pensions.
He won't even talk about it.

1386
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:33,283
There won't be any increase in pensions.
Do you know why?

1387
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,202
Because they got a solid majority...

1388
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,537
...of Republicans and Democrats
who've agreed...

1389
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,831
...that if anything
is said about pensions,

1390
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:41,958
they'll actually reduce your pension!

1391
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:44,836
Why? Because they know
that you personally...

1392
01:29:45,004 --> 01:29:48,715
...were more responsible than anybody
else for closing down the houses.

1393
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:51,301
Could I do anything?
Would he listen to me?

1394
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:54,888
Ha! All right.
So you're an honest cop...

1395
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,557
...and you've spent a lifetime
being an honest cop...

1396
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:00,519
...and you've got that,
and that's all you've got!

1397
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:02,854
It's no good saying I'm sorry.

1398
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:06,149
I'm too angry and sick at my stomach
to be sorry.

1399
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:08,068
[Billie Sue] You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

1400
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,654
That's the trouble with this family.

1401
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:15,033
- Melville, I smell something burning.
- Ah...

1402
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:20,330
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1403
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,250
We're on fire! Come over here.

1404
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:26,336
Come on. This way.
Go down. Now. Go.

1405
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:28,004
Hurry up!

1406
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:30,132
Put it out!

1407
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:32,676
I don't know how! Get something!

1408
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:35,011
- The extinguishers.
- Get one!

1409
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,265
- What'll I do?
- Use it!

1410
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,975
Not on me! On the fire!

1411
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:41,518
It's too deep!

1412
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,019
This is a car, not a canoe!

1413
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:45,188
Come on! It's easy!

1414
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:48,567
If I don't get out of here...
Why? Why?

1415
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:54,698
All right! Here I come!

1416
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,078
It's too deep!

1417
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:02,497
It's too deep, you little rat fink!

1418
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,875
Why didn't you tell me it was...
What do I...

1419
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:07,961
Don't stand there!
Get somebody! Don't...

1420
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,005
This is no place for a convertible!

1421

[Grunting]

1422
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:14,384
I'll get you.

1425
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,895
I'm bleeding, Emmeline!
Look! I'm bleeding!

1426
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:28,064
[Sobbing] Mama!
What did they do to my Mama?

1427
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:30,567
[Panting]

1428
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,736
Ow! Ooh!

Benjy!

1430
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,341
[Ginger] It's your father's fault.

1431
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:57,093
- The whole thing is your father's fault.
- [Billie Sue] Mommy.

1432
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:59,095
[Ginger] It's your father's fault.

1433
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:02,098
What's the matter, Chief?
Something wrong?

1434
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:05,268
- [Ginger] You know as well as I do...
- [Billie Sue] Listen and stop yelling!

1435
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:06,895
[Ginger] Stop it, Billie.

1436
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,105
- Billie, you're not listening.
- [Billie Sue sobbing]

1437

[Overlapping chatter]

1438
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:16,738
# Well, step into the lobby

1439

# For whatever is your hobby

1440
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,954
# To drink or smoke or repeat some joke

1441

[Monica whimpering]

1443
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:53,149
Now stop it. Stop it, Monica!

1444
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:55,986
It's only two pieces of small dynamite.

1445
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,697
[Stammering] And they're 70 feet away
in the other room.

1446
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:02,742
This is a strong counter.
We can't possibly get hurt from there.

1447
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:23,930
Please, go and stop it.
Stamp on it or something.

1448
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:27,267
- You know I hate explosions.
- It's perfectly all right.

1449
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:31,313
I just want to blow a small hole
in the wall, then we'll be out of here.

1450
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,160
Something's happened to the fuse.

1451
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,787
- What could possibly...
- Hold it. Sh!

1452
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:49,164
Listen.

1453
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:53,418
The fuse has gone out.
I can't hear it anymore.

1454
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:57,297
- Stay down. Don't get up.
- I just want to take a look, okay?

1455
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,720
Huh! Now I see.

1456
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:07,223
It's the fire extinguisher stuff.

1457
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:10,060
The fire extinguisher stuff got
on the fuse and put it out.

1458
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:12,479
Melville, don't go in there.
You'll be killed.

1459
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:16,024
- You'll be blown to bits.
- Monica, for heaven's sake.

I just want to take a look!

1461
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:24,616
Why do you always imagine
I can't do things for myself?

1462
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,951
Don't you think I got any sense at all?

1463
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:29,913
Why can't you have
a little confidence in me?

How long I been flying?

1470
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,667

01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,537
What do we do?

1494
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:37,207
The switch, let go of the switch!

1495
01:36:37,374 --> 01:36:39,542
[Man on radio] If you can,
give us your position.

1496
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:42,212
Who's flying the plane? Over.

1497
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:45,256
Whaddya mean, "Who's flying the plane?"

1498
01:36:45,424 --> 01:36:47,675
Nobody's flying the plane!

1499
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:49,886
Sir? Tower here. Emergency.

1500
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:53,223
Tell him it's a full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

1501
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,892
Full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.

1502
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,478
It's a Twin Beech.
I saw one here this morning.

1503
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,397
Who's got a Twin Beech?
It's that Col. Wilberforce.

1504
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:04,776
He was at maintenance.
If he's still there, get him over here.

1505
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:07,612
Now listen. Don't talk, just listen.

1506
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:10,573
We're getting things under control,
so you can take it easy.

1507
01:37:10,741 --> 01:37:12,367
We know what kind of a plane you're in.

1508
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:14,911
We're making necessary preparations
to talk you down.

1509
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:16,371
Rancho Conejo over.

1510
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:19,749
[Dingy] Rancho Conejo tower, listen,
we can't land this thing!

1511
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,043
We're in real trouble. Over!

1512
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:25,588
You'll be perfectly all right
as long as you follow instructions.

1513
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:29,092
The man at the controls should
also be the man on the radio.

1514
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:33,429
- Here. Put 'em on.
- No. I don't want to!

1515
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:34,806
Put 'em on!

1516
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:37,600
He said the fella flying
should be on this thing.

1517
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:40,895
Am I supposed to do everything?
You want me to fly, work the radio?

1518
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:43,314
What are you? The hostess?

1519
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:46,860
No, he's got to take charge.
What's the matter with him?

1520
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:48,987
He's just sitting there, rigid-like.

1521
01:37:49,154 --> 01:37:52,532
If he catches you at that keyhole,
you'll be rigid-like.

1522
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,785
- He didn't want to be disturbed.
- He keeps looking at the wall.

1523
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:58,621
He'll have to be disturbed
if any of this develops further.

1524
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:03,084
I bet you any amount of money that
we could get on the ball and get...

1525
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,630
Everything's under control, Chief.

1526
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:11,801
- You okay, Chief?
- Yes. Why?

1527
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:14,345
- How's it going?
- Something's bound to happen soon.

1528
01:38:14,513 --> 01:38:15,763
Take a look at this.

1529
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:18,308
Those two in the basement
started a fire...

1530
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:21,144
...then set off fireworks.
They still didn't get out.

1531
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,897
Those two guys in the airplane
had an accident...

1532
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:25,481
...knocked the pilot unconscious.

1533
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:27,984
The control tower
is trying to talk them down.

1534
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:30,153
[Both yelling]

1535
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:31,654
[Man] The others...

1536
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:34,407
Aerial report that the man,
Otto Meyer, had an accident.

1537
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:37,076
He tried to cross a river
and he lost his car.

1538
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:39,996
Now he's on foot,
walking back to the main road.

1539
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:43,499
This fella Pike, he's here...

1540
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:47,629
...coming in on 94 with Mrs. Marcus
and her daughter, Mrs. Finch.

1541
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:52,842
Mr. Finch and this Algernon,
whatever his name is. The limey.

1542
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:54,844
They're about five
or six miles behind...

1543
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:57,805
...in an Avis Chevrolet they rented
in Canyon City.

1544
01:38:57,973 --> 01:39:00,683
And this Sylvester Marcus,
the one the old lady called...

1545
01:39:00,851 --> 01:39:03,186
...he's about here going
in the other direction.

1546
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:08,441
They all ought to be meeting up
in about five minutes.

1547
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,167
You know what I believe I'd like?

1548
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:33,341
A chocolate fudge sundae
with whipped cream and a cherry on top.

1549
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,930
[Engine droning]

1550
01:39:48,565 --> 01:39:53,069
Dingy, don't let this worry you.
We're gonna get killed.

1551
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,363
[Man on radio] Men,
this is Col. Wilberforce speaking.

1552
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:59,242
These gentlemen here have asked me
to take charge of this situation...

1553
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:03,705
...so I immediately said
that I'd be glad to take charge of it.

1554
01:40:03,872 --> 01:40:05,748
Before I say anything else...

1555
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:08,042
I don't think he's going to
help us, Dingy.

1556
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,211
Yes he is, Benjy. He'll help us.

1557
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:13,589
Now, just have confidence in him.
He's a colonel. Listen to him.

1558
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:15,466
Steady, men.

1559
01:40:15,634 --> 01:40:18,803
I'm told that neither of you
has had flying experience.

1560
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:20,763
Before I say anything else...

1561
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:24,308
...I want to congratulate you
on having done so well...

1562
01:40:24,476 --> 01:40:26,269
...uh, so far.

1563
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:30,481
Now, first of all, men,
I'll explain what we intend to do.

1564
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:34,277
You can't land the airplane
until you've made your approach.

1565
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:39,407
And you can't make your approach until
you've made a long slow turnaround...

1566
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:41,200
...down to the south.

1567
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,995
And we've got to be clear
on a few things

1568
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,956
before you can start
that long slow turn.

1569
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:51,836
Now, the stick that you're holding,
that is, I assume that...

1570
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,796
Men, are you holding that stick?

1571
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:55,882
Is somebody holding that stick? Over!

1572
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:59,427
[Benjy] What stick? The wheel.
I'm holding it.

1573
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,679
- [Dingy] We're both holding it.
- Good.

1574
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:05,141
For a second there, I was afraid...
Never mind that.

1575
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:08,644
Now I'll explain the controls.
It's important that you understand that.

1576
01:41:08,812 --> 01:41:11,522
Because if you don't,
I'm afraid what might...

1577
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:13,524
[engine droning]

1578
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:34,962
- You want a lift?
- Yes, thank you very much.

1579
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,173
It's nice of you to stop.

1580
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:40,343
- I'm going as far as Santa Rosita Park.
- That's out of my way.

1581
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:41,886
- We're blocking traffic.
- We are?

1582
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:43,179
Let's move it. Move it.

1583
01:41:58,195 --> 01:41:59,779
There we go. All right.

1584
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:03,032
You hide behind the counter.
I'll light up a fuse.

1585
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:07,411
Melville, will you just do one thing
for me before you use the dynamite?

1586
01:42:07,579 --> 01:42:10,289
Try hitting the door just once more.

1587
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:14,544
Honey, I broke my back on that door.
That's a hard door. I mean...

1588
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:19,799
Okay.

1589
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:22,051
Where's the sledgehammer?

1590
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:33,437
This staircase isn't safe anymore.
The fire burned it all out.

1591
01:42:33,605 --> 01:42:34,814
Please?

1592
01:42:37,192 --> 01:42:38,526
All right.

1593
01:42:49,621 --> 01:42:51,497
You're going to...

1594
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:58,921
[Monica screaming]

1595
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:02,675
Melville, for God...

1596
01:43:02,843 --> 01:43:04,093
Melville!

1597
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:08,514
Monica...

1598
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:11,642
...now let's forget about the door, huh?

1599
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:16,814
Look out!

1600
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:18,983
- What?
- They've spotted us.

1601
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:21,194
- Who have?
- Don't stop. Keep going.

1602
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:23,404
- What is this?
- Helicopter. They've seen us.

1603
01:43:23,572 --> 01:43:24,947
What helicopter?

1604
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:30,620
- That's a police helicopter.
- They always use them.

1605
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:33,539
- Who?
- Who do you think? Look...

1606
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:36,459
I don't want to talk about this,
but they got me hemmed in.

1607
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:38,461
- Who?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1608
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:42,548
I'm going to break a rule that says
we must never reveal our true identity.

1609
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:45,468
This is a matter of life or death,
a desperate situation.

1610
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:48,054
- What is?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1611
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:51,057
Look, I haven't got much time,
so if you love your country...

1612
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:53,809
...if you're a patriot, you'll listen,
and listen hard.

1613
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:55,811
You gotta get to a phone
and make a call.

1614
01:43:55,979 --> 01:43:57,939
- I don't got...
- You got to call Intelligence.

1615
01:43:58,106 --> 01:44:00,107
Central Intelligence Agency
in Washington, D.C.

1616
01:44:00,275 --> 01:44:02,360
- What on earth...
- Now, listen!

1617
01:44:02,527 --> 01:44:05,738
You tell 'em you heard from X-27.
You got it? X-27.

1618
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:09,367
X-27 told you to tell them they've made
three attempts on my life today.

1619
01:44:09,534 --> 01:44:11,202
They tried to drown me.

1620
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,537
Can you handle a gun? Now, look... Oh!

1621
01:44:13,705 --> 01:44:16,374
There's a cafe. Pull right in there.
You'll use that phone.

1622
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:18,793
- I don't think I...
- Shut up! You're in no danger.

1623
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:20,711
They've never seen ya. Now, pull in.

1624
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:29,845
All right, good. Get to a phone.

1625
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:33,349
Tell the operator "emergency priority,"
then ask for the CIA.

1626
01:44:33,517 --> 01:44:35,518
Jump out. Come on, come on.

1627
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:37,561
You're in no danger.
They don't know you.

1628
01:44:37,729 --> 01:44:40,523
You're all right.
I'll duck the car and come back.

1629
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,608
For God's sake,
don't stand in the street.

1630
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:44,360
They'll see you. They'll spot you!

1631
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,862
Move it. Yah! Go!

1632
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:03,879
And... Sylvester! It's Sylvester!
Turn around, you idiot!

1633
01:45:04,047 --> 01:45:06,674
What do you want to stop him for?
He's going the wrong way.

1634
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:09,468
It's my son. Do as you're told, stupid.

1635
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:17,018
[Tires screeching]

1636
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:27,069
They're nuts.

1637
01:45:27,237 --> 01:45:30,573
Tell them the tow truck turned around
and is following the Dodge.

1638
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,409
2-1-7-1, 2-1-5-9.

1639
01:45:34,745 --> 01:45:36,412
This is stupid.

1640
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,080
You call me a stupid idiot.

1641
01:45:38,248 --> 01:45:40,541
Let me tell you something.
You're a stupid idiot.

1642
01:45:40,709 --> 01:45:44,628
- He'll go all the way to Plaster City.
- So he goes to Plaster City.

1643
01:45:44,796 --> 01:45:47,423
I don't know about you,
but I'm turning this thing around.

1644
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:50,801
Now, you want to catch him,
you get out and run.

1645
01:46:11,073 --> 01:46:12,740
Let's stop arguing. Please.

1646
01:46:12,908 --> 01:46:15,618
The reason we're together
is because they only had one car.

1647
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:18,621
Let's get there, even if we are last.

1648
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:23,084
Whatever the outcome of the day,
I shall never forget that you hit me...

1649
01:46:23,251 --> 01:46:25,378
...when I wasn't even looking.

1650
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:26,545
Yeah.

1651
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:35,054
- [Horn honking]
- [Tires screeching]

1652
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:36,847
[Man] Russell!

1653
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:54,115
- How can you be so slow?
- I've had just about enough out of you.

1654
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:56,033
If ya turned quicker
we coulda caught him!

1655
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:59,245
- Why don't you shut up?
- Russell! There!

1656
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:01,330
It's Russell and Mr. Hawthorne!

1657
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:02,665
Stop them! Catch them!

1658
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:04,166
We gonna start that again?

1659
01:47:04,334 --> 01:47:06,877
Faster! Step on it!
Blow the horn, you big dope!

1660
01:47:07,045 --> 01:47:08,712
What do you want them for anyway?

1661
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,881
Keep up with them.
You're falling behind.

1662
01:47:11,049 --> 01:47:13,551
Sylvester! Mother! Sylvester!

1663
01:47:13,718 --> 01:47:16,345
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

1664
01:47:17,722 --> 01:47:20,433
[Horn honking]

1665
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:24,311
I say, what's that chap
honking his hooter for?

1666
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:27,314
It's probably some road hog
who thinks he owns...

1667
01:47:27,482 --> 01:47:28,774
- What?
- What?

1668
01:47:28,942 --> 01:47:31,861
I got to ask you something about Mama!
Russell, wait a minute!

1669
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:34,864
- It's my brother-in-law.
- What's he doing?

1670
01:47:35,031 --> 01:47:37,658
Be careful of him. He's not normal.

1671
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:41,245
You're getting me...
Boy, are you bugging me, man!

1672
01:47:41,413 --> 01:47:45,374
I'm going to nail...
I'm getting bugged now!

1673
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:46,500
Whoa, man.

1674
01:47:46,668 --> 01:47:47,710
[Horn honking]

1675
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:50,212
Russell, if you don't pull over,
I'll kill you!

1676
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:52,381
I'm warning you,
pull over and stop.

1677
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:53,924
I said stop!

1678
01:47:54,092 --> 01:47:55,718
You asked for it.

1679
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,392
[All shouting]

1680
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:05,311
[Sylvester] Russell,
when I get my hands on you...

1681
01:48:06,354 --> 01:48:08,063
What are you doing?

1682
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:09,732
- I said stop!
- Are you crazy?

1683
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,067
- We'll get killed!
- Pull over!

1684
01:48:22,454 --> 01:48:25,915
Don't you know what I mean?
I said stop that car!

1685
01:48:26,082 --> 01:48:28,626
- [All shouting]
- [Horn honking]

1686
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:34,590
When I get my hands on you, Russell,
I will kill you!

1687
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:37,718
[Sylvester screams]

1688
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:55,110
Are you crazy?

1689
01:48:55,278 --> 01:48:57,321
Ah!

1690
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:06,622
I've never seen anything
like this bunch.

1691
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:09,458
He ran right into them,
ran them right off the road.

1692
01:49:10,627 --> 01:49:14,296
- You guys, come on out of there!
- Fellow's absolutely beside himself.

1693
01:49:14,464 --> 01:49:16,882
- What are you trying to do?
- Let's go!

1694
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:19,510
- What did you do to my mother?
- We wouldn't do any...

1695
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:21,637
Move! Move!

1696
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:25,307
- What did you do to my mother?
- I didn't do anything! Let me explain.

1697
01:49:25,475 --> 01:49:26,809
Look here.

1698
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,144
She called me. She phoned me.

1699
01:49:29,312 --> 01:49:31,981
What she told me was so horrible,
I thought she'd gone nuts!

1700
01:49:32,148 --> 01:49:33,649
- It was true, wasn't it?
- It's not true.

1701
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:36,610
Whoever told you was a liar.
It's not true.

1702
01:49:36,778 --> 01:49:39,530
- It is true!
- Now, look here!

1703
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:43,200
Are you English? Just answer me!

1704
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:46,662
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.
Don't you like the English?

1705
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:49,039
[Screaming]

1706
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:51,417
There was an Englishman.

1707
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:54,628
She said that you and this Englishman...
I'll kill you!

1708
01:49:56,006 --> 01:49:57,673
What did you do to my Mama?

1709
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,801
- Emmeline!
- Mama!

1710
01:50:00,969 --> 01:50:03,762
Why couldn't you listen?
Why couldn't you shut up...

1711
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,514
...when I was trying
to tell you to listen?

1712
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:08,642
That chap's run absolutely amok!

1713
01:50:09,811 --> 01:50:11,353
Few minutes, we'll have 'em in position.

1714
01:50:11,521 --> 01:50:14,356
In a couple of minutes,
we'll have you in position.

1715
01:50:14,524 --> 01:50:16,900
- You're doing a great job, Colonel.
- Thank you.

1716
01:50:17,068 --> 01:50:19,528
Why not just shoot 'em down?

1717
01:50:20,113 --> 01:50:23,032
None of these people must suspect...

1718
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:26,035
...that they have ever been
under observation.

1719
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,204
Now, none of them have ever seen me.

1720
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:30,914
None of them know me...

1721
01:50:31,082 --> 01:50:33,792
...so I'll be moving in alone.

1722
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:37,963
The minute I move in,
I'll give you the word.

1723
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:40,132
And when you pass the word...

1724
01:50:41,384 --> 01:50:44,845
...I don't want to have another
policeman within miles of me.

1725
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:46,388
- Right?
- Right.

1726
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:50,768
I, uh...

1727
01:50:50,935 --> 01:50:54,396
I won't like it
if I see another policeman.

1728
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,024
I give you my word.

1729
01:50:57,192 --> 01:51:00,736
I wanted to stop for you.
My wife and he wanted to stop for you.

1730
01:51:00,904 --> 01:51:03,197
Tell him how my mother-in-law
made us drive by him.

1731
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:05,658
Anything you have to say
about your mother-in-law...

1732
01:51:05,825 --> 01:51:07,242
...you don't have to explain to me.

1733
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:08,494
You know what I mean?

1734
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:11,622
If she were a star
of a real crummy horror movie...

1735
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:14,333
...I'd believe it.
- [Horn honking]

1736
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:16,001
Yeah!

1737
01:51:16,169 --> 01:51:17,211
That's him!

1738
01:51:17,379 --> 01:51:20,589
If I catch you, I'll kill you!
I tell you, I'll kill you!

1739
01:51:20,757 --> 01:51:22,925
You dirty robber!

1740
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:24,718
Someone you know?

1741
01:51:40,276 --> 01:51:42,152
I'll drive. All set?

1742
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,987
All set, Chief.

1743
01:51:44,155 --> 01:51:45,823
Culpeper, all set?

1744
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:46,907
[Man on radio] Yes, sir.

1745
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:49,785
Airport just reported
and they're starting an approach now.

1746
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:51,078
Right.

1747
01:51:58,962 --> 01:52:01,380
What's the matter, Chief?
You forgotten something?

1748
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:06,552
No. I don't think
I've forgotten a thing.

1749
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:22,192
Now, men, about the brakes...
You've got to know about the brakes.

1750
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:26,488
[Stammering] I'll tell you
in just a minute. Just hold it a second.

1751
01:52:26,656 --> 01:52:28,907
What the hell is with this wire?

1752
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:31,118
Just hold it a second.

1753
01:52:31,286 --> 01:52:32,661
- [Engine droning]
- What was that?

1754
01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:33,912
Men, look.

1755
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:38,417
Be calm. This is it.
Just one minute more, it'll be all over.

1756
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:41,128
I mean, it'll all be over.
I mean, courage, men.

1757
01:52:41,296 --> 01:52:44,339
We're all with you every second.

1758
01:52:44,507 --> 01:52:47,176
We're pulling for you
as hard as we can.

1759
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:49,970
Now it's just hold onto
your nerves, men,

1760
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:52,055
and not get excited
or do anything foolish.

1761
01:52:52,223 --> 01:52:54,516
But just keep calm.
That's all we'll do.

1762
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:56,935
Keep calm. Calm, men!

1763
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:02,524
Not that calm, you idiot!

1764
01:53:02,692 --> 01:53:05,152
[Both screaming]

1765
01:53:07,238 --> 01:53:09,114
Pull up!

1766
01:53:22,086 --> 01:53:24,171
Now, don't worry. Just keep calm.

1767
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:25,214
[Whistling]

1768
01:53:25,381 --> 01:53:28,050
What's this?
What's this that's coming?

1769
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:32,679
- That's good. That's cement.
- What? Wait a minute! Hold it!

1770
01:53:32,847 --> 01:53:34,890
What are you doing, Benjy?

1771
01:53:38,019 --> 01:53:40,437
[Screaming]

1772
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:42,898
- What, are you trying to scare me?
- No!

1773
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,566
Well, you did.

1774
01:53:47,028 --> 01:53:50,239
It's just a couple of sticks
of dynamite, that's all.

1775
01:53:50,406 --> 01:53:54,076
How much noise could it make?
Boom. It's all over.

1776
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:56,078
Get it over right! Get it over!

1777
01:53:56,246 --> 01:53:57,246
Left rudder!

1778
01:53:57,413 --> 01:53:59,373
Too low! Pull up.

1779
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:00,916
No! Left rudder!

1780
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:04,211
No! Pull it up!

1781
01:54:04,379 --> 01:54:05,462
Help!

1782
01:54:07,549 --> 01:54:11,093
[Screaming] Help!
I'm the Colonel, you know!

1783
01:54:11,261 --> 01:54:12,261
Help!

1784
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:14,805
Help! Get me down!

1785
01:54:17,767 --> 01:54:19,935
We're not going to land
and we'll never make it.

1786
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:23,605
What do you mean, we'll never make it?
Don't freeze.

1787
01:54:23,773 --> 01:54:25,691
Benjy, don't freeze.

1788
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:31,446
This one's going to work.

1789
01:54:31,614 --> 01:54:33,615
- Damn it, come to!
- You hit me.

1790
01:54:33,783 --> 01:54:36,535
Listen, wait a minute.

1791
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:44,585
We're down!

1792
01:54:44,752 --> 01:54:46,628
- We're on the ground.
- Hooray!

1793
01:54:46,796 --> 01:54:49,882
It's just a noise, that's all.
It's way over there.

1794
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:55,512
Put on the brakes.

1795
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:57,055
Okay. Where are they?

1796
01:54:57,223 --> 01:54:59,349
Benjy! Here comes a restaurant!

1797
01:55:01,436 --> 01:55:03,896
[All screaming]

1798
01:55:07,108 --> 01:55:08,692
We've landed! Come on.

1799
01:55:14,949 --> 01:55:17,534
Come on. Hurry. Now, hurry up.

1800
01:55:17,702 --> 01:55:19,703
- Come on, let's go.
- What about him?

1801
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:21,914
Never mind him.
An ambulance will come.

1802
01:55:22,081 --> 01:55:23,874
- [Siren wailing]
- Let's get out of here.

1803
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:27,711
Cab!

1804
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:30,923
Cab! [shouting]

1805
01:55:31,382 --> 01:55:34,301
We're in an awful hurry.
Do you know where the State Park is?

1806
01:55:34,469 --> 01:55:36,386
Sure. What happened?

1807
01:55:36,554 --> 01:55:38,263
Emergency landing. Come on, hurry.

1808
01:55:38,431 --> 01:55:40,182
Quick, let's go. Come on.

1809
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,767
Come on, Benjy.

1810
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:49,107
[All chattering in foreign language]

1811
01:55:51,903 --> 01:55:53,612
[Screams]

1812
01:55:54,447 --> 01:55:56,990
Oh! Excuse me.

1813
01:56:00,536 --> 01:56:01,787
[Chuckles]

1814
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:03,872
Excuse us. Here's your bag.

1815
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:07,626
You see, the lock didn't work.

1816
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:08,710
Go.

1817
01:56:08,878 --> 01:56:12,798
That's all.
The owners will pay for everything.

1818
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:15,300
Next door, he'll pay for everything.
It's okay.

1819
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:25,435
You people. You!

1820
01:56:25,603 --> 01:56:27,562
Come back here. Come back!

1821
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:29,523
You vandals!

1822
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:33,068
The cops in this town
are morons, retarded.

1823
01:56:33,236 --> 01:56:35,070
I'm dealing with moronic people.

1824
01:56:35,238 --> 01:56:37,572
'Cause he's in a bad humor,
that fat Nazi.

1825
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:39,366
What, I gotta suffer 'cause of him?

1826
01:56:39,534 --> 01:56:42,119
Get away from me.
What's the matter?

1827
01:56:42,286 --> 01:56:46,748
Can't you see I'm on the phone?
Gimme two minutes!

1828
01:56:46,916 --> 01:56:48,542
Now, listen, Sy...

1829
01:56:49,168 --> 01:56:51,586
Will you take us
to Santa Rosita State Park?

1830
01:56:51,754 --> 01:56:54,297
What's the matter?
What happened to you? Initiation?

1831
01:56:54,465 --> 01:56:56,258
We had an accident. Hurry up!

1832
01:56:57,093 --> 01:56:59,720
[Man on radio] Benjamin and Bell stopped
at a gardener supply place

1833
01:56:59,887 --> 01:57:01,847
and bought picks and shovels.

1834
01:57:02,015 --> 01:57:04,558
Hold it, Chief.
Here's a report on the Crumps.

1835
01:57:04,726 --> 01:57:09,104
Their cab turned onto 101 moving south
toward your present position.

1836
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:13,316
Wait. The other taxi's
also turning onto 101...

1837
01:57:13,484 --> 01:57:16,528
...and they're moving north.
They're both coming your way.

1838
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:17,779
Understood.

1839
01:57:17,947 --> 01:57:19,281
Stand by.

1840
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:22,409
- They ought to be here any minute.
- Uh-huh.

1841
01:57:45,975 --> 01:57:47,225
Look.

1842
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:51,104
It's the two idiots, the little one and
the one with the marbles in his mouth.

1843
01:57:51,272 --> 01:57:54,024
- It's that hokey dentist.
- Yeah.

1844
01:57:54,192 --> 01:57:55,400
Pass that cab.

1845
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:57,235
- What's the rush?
- Whaddaya mean "rush"?

1846
01:57:57,403 --> 01:57:59,780
No rush. We're just in a hurry.

1847
01:58:08,289 --> 01:58:09,831
Culpeper.

1848
01:58:09,999 --> 01:58:11,500
Now.

1849
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:13,502
Give the order to pull away.

1850
01:58:19,842 --> 01:58:22,219
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Shouldn't I wait around?

1851
01:58:22,386 --> 01:58:23,345
No. Here's $5.

1852
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:27,140
- What's with the pick and shovel?
- Mind your own business. Come on.

1853
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:32,479
Hey! Hey!

1854
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:35,232
- Think anybody is here?
- Didn't see any cars.

1855
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:37,067
Wait a minute!

1856
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:40,028
- Let's talk this over.
- I got nothing to talk about.

1857
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:41,822
Wait a minute.

1858
01:58:41,989 --> 01:58:43,365
Think anybody else has been here?

1859
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:45,784
- How should I know?
- Wait!

1860
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:48,703
If you think we're the first ones here,
why not make a deal?

1861
01:58:48,871 --> 01:58:49,830
The four of us?

1862
01:58:49,997 --> 01:58:52,332
Nobody knows where to look,
so we'll look together.

1863
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:57,045
We'll find it before the others.
Incidentally, where are all the others?

1864
01:58:57,213 --> 01:59:00,882
How come you two just got here?
You had the plane.

1865
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:04,553
Yeah... What happened to you?

1866
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:07,389
They're up to something funny,
you hear?

1867
01:59:07,557 --> 01:59:11,393
Did you see the blonde I brought,
covered in paint with her dress ripped?

1868
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:13,103
What's that all about?

1869
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:16,898
Yeah. And what about
the picks and shovels?

1870
01:59:25,658 --> 01:59:29,119
You run back to headquarters.
Wait till you hear from me.

1871
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:30,412
Let me come, Chief.

1872
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:33,290
I'd like to,
but it might snarl things up.

1873
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:36,251
Thanks for everything.

1874
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:38,211
Lots of luck, Chief.

1875
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:01,610
[Tires screeching]

1876
02:00:12,955 --> 02:00:15,916
Benjy! Did you see anything, pal?

1877
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:18,501
No, but there must be
something somewhere.

1878
02:00:18,669 --> 02:00:21,338
Yeah... Hey! Hey!

1879
02:00:22,673 --> 02:00:24,299
- See anything?
- Not a thing.

1880
02:00:24,467 --> 02:00:27,636
Are you sure he didn't say
something you've forgotten?

1881
02:00:27,803 --> 02:00:31,556
He said it's buried under a big W
and that we'd see it.

1882
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:33,975
- It's gotta be here.
- I tell you what we do.

1883
02:00:34,143 --> 02:00:36,353
You go how we came.
We'll go how you came.

1884
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,897
We might have missed something.
Hold it.

1885
02:00:39,982 --> 02:00:41,942
You go the way we came...

1886
02:00:42,109 --> 02:00:44,027
That's right. Okay, let's go.

1887
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:54,162
They're looking for something
buried under a big W.

1888
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:57,040
I heard one of them,
the stutterer, say it.

1889
02:00:57,208 --> 02:00:59,542
Yeah, I heard. But what?

1890
02:01:48,009 --> 02:01:49,217
Hey!

1891
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:50,677
Did you see anything?

1892
02:01:50,845 --> 02:01:52,137
- No. Did you?
- Nothing.

1893
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:54,889
That guy hid it so good,
he couldn't find it himself.

1894
02:01:55,057 --> 02:01:56,057
I think...

1895
02:02:06,235 --> 02:02:07,402
Who's he?

1896
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:10,238
- I don't know.
- But he had a shovel.

1897
02:02:10,406 --> 02:02:11,865
Maybe he's a prospector.

1898
02:02:12,033 --> 02:02:14,117
- What are you talking...
- We're wasting time.

1899
02:02:14,285 --> 02:02:16,036
Harder. We gotta look harder!

1900
02:02:16,203 --> 02:02:18,496
Let's look harder. Come on, let's go.

1901
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:31,760
Who's he?

1902
02:02:31,927 --> 02:02:34,095
I don't know,
but he hasn't got a shovel.

1903
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:42,270
[Engine pops]

1904
02:02:42,438 --> 02:02:44,689
- He's here, I tell ya.
- Yes, sir. That's his car.

1905
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:47,734
- I'll get that phony.
- Somebody must've come in those cabs.

1906
02:02:47,902 --> 02:02:51,363
- Come on, let's get moving!
- Come on, let's get moving!

1907
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:54,449
- They must be here.
- They'd better be. Come on, Emmeline.

1908
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:57,243
- Don't just sit there!
- Don't just sit there!

1909
02:02:57,411 --> 02:02:59,204
Yes, I am.

1910
02:02:59,372 --> 02:03:01,456
Then sit!

1911
02:03:01,624 --> 02:03:04,334
Mrs. Finch,
aren't you the teeniest bit curious?

1912
02:03:04,502 --> 02:03:08,546
No. I'm not even curious,
just disgusted.

1913
02:03:08,714 --> 02:03:12,384
I say, that really is a pity.
Do forgive me, I must go.

1914
02:03:19,683 --> 02:03:21,976
Psst!

1915
02:03:22,144 --> 02:03:24,479
[Mrs. Marcus] You wouldn't know a big W
if you saw one!

1916
02:03:24,647 --> 02:03:25,980
- [Russell] I know a...
- [Mrs. Marcus] Shut up!

1917
02:03:26,148 --> 02:03:29,025
I don't care what you say,
I don't think they're here yet.

1918
02:03:29,193 --> 02:03:31,820
They're here somewhere.
That means they haven't found it.

1919
02:03:31,987 --> 02:03:34,155
That's all he said? "Under a big W"?

1920
02:03:34,323 --> 02:03:36,616
Actually, I joined the party after that.

1921
02:03:36,784 --> 02:03:39,160
Yes, sir, that's what he said.
It's under a big W.

1922
02:03:39,328 --> 02:03:42,831
- Let's look...
- Will you shut up and follow me?

1923
02:03:42,998 --> 02:03:45,333
[Continue arguing]

1924
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:11,568
[Arguing continues]

1925
02:04:37,136 --> 02:04:38,428
- Who's that?
- I don't know!

1926
02:04:38,596 --> 02:04:40,388
- From this morning?
- Yes.

1927
02:04:43,058 --> 02:04:45,226
- Who's he?
- I don't know.

1928
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:48,354
- Who's he?
- I don't know!

1929
02:04:48,522 --> 02:04:51,441
Mama, how many people
are mixed up in this?

1930
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:55,278
Mama, who are they? Cabbies?

1931
02:04:55,446 --> 02:04:57,363
Mama, this thing's like a convention.

1932
02:05:34,568 --> 02:05:37,237
Is anything wrong, ma'am?
I didn't mean to startle you.

1933
02:05:37,404 --> 02:05:41,157
Who are you? Are you with the others,
the ones that are looking?

1934
02:05:41,325 --> 02:05:43,660
- I am, in a way. Aren't you?
- No.

1935
02:05:43,827 --> 02:05:46,913
I mean, I didn't want anything
to do with it right from the start.

1936
02:05:47,081 --> 02:05:48,957
And you know what?

1937
02:05:49,124 --> 02:05:53,628
I know where it is. I'm the only one,
and I wasn't even looking.

1938
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:55,088
You know where it is?

1939
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:57,298
Yes! What should I do?

1940
02:05:58,884 --> 02:06:00,843
Ugh!

1941
02:06:01,011 --> 02:06:03,012
Come on out, everyone!
This is ridiculous.

1942
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:05,515
- I absolutely agree.
- Come on out.

1943
02:06:05,683 --> 02:06:08,142
We all know we're all here.
Nobody's fooling anyone.

1944
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:09,811
So we all know. So what?

1945
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:12,146
Don't talk to my mama
in that tone of voice!

1946
02:06:12,314 --> 02:06:13,648
- You hear?
- Shut up!

1947
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:17,694
Listen, we ain't the only ones here.
I seen four or five others.

1948
02:06:17,861 --> 02:06:19,320
Those two cab drivers.

1949
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:22,490
- They came with us and that dentist.
- You want to start?

1950
02:06:22,658 --> 02:06:25,827
- Yes, I want to...
- Why are we wasting time?

1951
02:06:25,995 --> 02:06:27,370
We're all here.

1952
02:06:27,538 --> 02:06:31,040
Even if somebody finds the money,
nobody gets away with it...

1953
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:33,251
...unless everybody gets a share.

1954
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:36,296
Let's all get sensible
and get this organized.

1955
02:06:36,463 --> 02:06:39,173
Did you all hear what Mama said?

1956
02:06:39,341 --> 02:06:41,884
- Come on, Mama.
- Now, wait a minute.

1957
02:06:42,052 --> 02:06:45,179
Did any of you see a guy with glasses...

1958
02:06:45,347 --> 02:06:47,974
...with a sneery expression on his face?

1959
02:06:48,142 --> 02:06:51,311
This guy was ugly.
I mean, like, real ugly.

1960
02:06:55,357 --> 02:06:59,902
If you help dig it up,
you can have half and I'll have half.

1961
02:07:00,070 --> 02:07:02,697
Is that okay? I mean, is that fair?

1962
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:05,742
If I have half of the money...

1963
02:07:05,909 --> 02:07:09,203
...I can go away somewhere
where nobody can find me.

1964
02:07:09,371 --> 02:07:14,375
Not Russell or my mother
or Sylvester, anybody.

1965
02:07:15,336 --> 02:07:17,587
You don't know what that'd mean.

1966
02:07:17,755 --> 02:07:19,047
If I had enough money...

1967
02:07:19,214 --> 02:07:22,592
...I might be able to live
in a convent or something.

1968
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:24,719
- In a convent?
- Uh-huh.

1969
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:27,555
We all know we're all here.

1970
02:07:27,723 --> 02:07:30,725
It seems intelligent to me
that we should all share...

1971
02:07:30,893 --> 02:07:33,019
...in one equal share apiece, right?

1972
02:07:33,187 --> 02:07:34,228
Right. Mel was right.

1973
02:07:34,396 --> 02:07:36,939
- We all know that. Lookit...
- [clanging]

1974
02:07:37,107 --> 02:07:39,692
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.

1975
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:42,153
It's him, all right. Yeah!

1976
02:07:43,113 --> 02:07:46,240
You got this wrong.
I came to apologize.

1977
02:07:46,408 --> 02:07:49,535
Forgive and forget! I'm your friend.

1978
02:07:49,703 --> 02:07:52,080
He's so neurotic.
Can't you do something?

1979
02:07:52,247 --> 02:07:53,039
I'll get you.

1980
02:07:53,207 --> 02:07:57,502
- He's very neurotic. I'm your friend!
- When I get my hands on you...

1981
02:08:02,591 --> 02:08:06,427
[choral singing]

1982
02:08:09,556 --> 02:08:10,640
Why, that's it.

1983
02:08:10,808 --> 02:08:12,767
Sure. Look!

1984
02:08:12,935 --> 02:08:15,019
It's the big W, I tell you!

1985
02:08:15,187 --> 02:08:17,522
It's the big W!

1986
02:08:19,775 --> 02:08:20,692
Look at this.

1987
02:08:20,859 --> 02:08:23,444
- Look at it!
- [All chattering]

1988
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:29,909
I'm sorry, Mrs. Finch.

1989
02:08:31,328 --> 02:08:33,496
I'm afraid it's too late.

1990
02:08:33,664 --> 02:08:35,623
I think they've found it.

1991
02:08:37,167 --> 02:08:40,128
Right here all the time!
He wasn't kidding!

1992
02:08:40,295 --> 02:08:44,465
- He was telling the truth!
- Folks, isn't this great?

1993
02:08:45,134 --> 02:08:47,927
Congratulations. Well done.

1994
02:08:48,095 --> 02:08:51,639
Listen, I think the big boy
should get an extra share.

1995
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:53,850
After all, it was he who found it.

1996
02:08:54,017 --> 02:08:57,270
Yes! I insist he gets an extra share.

1997
02:08:57,438 --> 02:08:59,731
That's right.
He deserves an extra share.

1998
02:08:59,898 --> 02:09:02,483
- Well, I...
- Let's start digging.

1999
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:04,819
Suppose somebody comes along.
What do we tell him?

2000
02:09:04,987 --> 02:09:07,739
We're here with
an anthropological expedition.

2001
02:09:07,906 --> 02:09:09,615
- Nah.
- We don't tell them anything!

2002
02:09:09,783 --> 02:09:12,201
We tell them to scram
or we beat their brains in.

2003
02:09:12,995 --> 02:09:14,912
It was a nice dream.

2004
02:09:16,165 --> 02:09:18,082
Lasted almost five minutes.

2005
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:21,919
[All shouting]

2006
02:09:28,093 --> 02:09:30,303
Now, don't bug me, I said.

2007
02:09:30,471 --> 02:09:32,221
Faster.

2008
02:09:32,389 --> 02:09:34,098
Come on, dig, dig.

2009
02:09:34,266 --> 02:09:36,309
Faster, faster.

2010
02:09:36,477 --> 02:09:39,145
Faster. Dig. That's it, dig.

2011
02:09:39,313 --> 02:09:41,856
[All chattering]

2012
02:10:10,135 --> 02:10:12,512
[Chattering continues]

2013
02:10:34,243 --> 02:10:35,284
Faster.

2014
02:10:48,924 --> 02:10:52,009
There's not enough room.
You two, out.

2015
02:10:52,177 --> 02:10:53,761
Let us do it.

2016
02:11:00,102 --> 02:11:03,604
Wait. There's not enough room.
You're bugging me.

2017
02:11:03,772 --> 02:11:05,857
- "Bugging"?
- Cut out, cut out.

2018
02:11:06,024 --> 02:11:07,316
What's this "cut out" talk?

2019
02:11:07,484 --> 02:11:09,735
- Out, baby. Out!
- Don't call me baby.

2020
02:11:09,903 --> 02:11:13,531
- Quit arguing!
- Will ya come on?

2021
02:11:13,699 --> 02:11:16,617
[All arguing]

2022
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:24,166
[Clanging]

2023
02:11:24,334 --> 02:11:26,711
- What's that?
- What was that?

2024
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:29,839
- That's it.
- Sounded like a chest.

2025
02:11:30,007 --> 02:11:32,216
I wonder what's in it.

2026
02:11:32,384 --> 02:11:33,885
Bring it up here!

2027
02:11:34,052 --> 02:11:36,137
[All chattering]

2028
02:11:41,059 --> 02:11:43,144
There it is!

2029
02:11:43,312 --> 02:11:45,146
- It's a satchel.
- Hold it up!

2030
02:11:46,648 --> 02:11:49,859
- It's a satchel!
- I got it.

2031
02:11:50,903 --> 02:11:52,153
Open it up.

2032
02:11:52,321 --> 02:11:53,654
Come on!

2033
02:11:55,991 --> 02:11:57,783
[Man] Bingo!

2034
02:11:58,577 --> 02:12:01,662
I say, chaps,
shouldn't we find a spot of cover?

2035
02:12:01,830 --> 02:12:02,997
There's nobody around.

2036
02:12:03,165 --> 02:12:04,665
Come on. Count it out.

2037
02:12:04,833 --> 02:12:07,126
- What are we waiting for?
- Now wait a second!

2038
02:12:07,294 --> 02:12:11,505
Everybody's going to get something, so
no arguments. We all get equal shares!

2039
02:12:11,673 --> 02:12:12,840
He's right.

2040
02:12:13,008 --> 02:12:15,927
That's the only way to do it.
Shares for everybody.

2041
02:12:16,094 --> 02:12:18,220
Now, how many are we?

2042
02:12:18,388 --> 02:12:20,264
One, two...

2043
02:12:20,432 --> 02:12:24,727
...three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

2044
02:12:25,604 --> 02:12:30,358
...9, 10, 11, 12, 13...

2045
02:12:30,525 --> 02:12:32,735
...14, 15.

2046
02:12:32,903 --> 02:12:35,529
15 of us. That means 15 equal shares.

2047
02:12:35,697 --> 02:12:39,283
You dirty double-crosser.
You cut yourself in for twice!

2048
02:12:39,451 --> 02:12:41,494
You can't get away with that!

2049
02:12:41,870 --> 02:12:42,954
Get him!

2050
02:12:43,121 --> 02:12:44,372
Grab him!

2051
02:12:44,539 --> 02:12:45,915
Get him!

2052
02:12:48,001 --> 02:12:51,504
You only cheated yourself
because now you're out.

2053
02:12:51,672 --> 02:12:55,341
Listen!
You can't cut me out now, you hear?

2054
02:12:55,509 --> 02:12:57,259
Not after what I've been through!

2055
02:12:58,220 --> 02:12:59,720
All right. Okay.

2056
02:12:59,888 --> 02:13:04,016
I'm warning you, if I don't get a share,
I'm going straight to the police.

2057
02:13:04,184 --> 02:13:07,436
- The police?
- What makes you think the police...

2058
02:13:08,146 --> 02:13:10,314
That money had to come from somewhere.

2059
02:13:10,482 --> 02:13:14,902
We know where it's from,
that poor man that died on the mountain.

2060
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:17,488
You wasn't even there, so shut up.

2061
02:13:17,656 --> 02:13:21,033
Okay, you asked for it.
I'm going straight to the police.

2062
02:13:21,201 --> 02:13:23,703
You think they'd be interested,
Mr. Meyer?

2063
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:26,288
Are you kidding? Isn't it obvious?

2064
02:13:26,456 --> 02:13:28,082
How do you think money gets...

2065
02:13:31,461 --> 02:13:32,920
How did you know my name?

2066
02:13:33,088 --> 02:13:34,505
You know this crook?

2067
02:13:34,673 --> 02:13:39,635
I've never met him, Mr. Pike,
but I've come to feel that I know him.

2068
02:13:40,595 --> 02:13:43,597
How did you know my name?
I've never met you.

2069
02:13:43,765 --> 02:13:46,517
Yeah, who are you?

2070
02:13:46,685 --> 02:13:48,227
Didn't he come with you?

2071
02:13:48,395 --> 02:13:51,313
He didn't come with us.
We thought he came with you.

2072
02:13:51,481 --> 02:13:52,773
[Dingy] No.

2073
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:57,153
If he didn't come with us,
then who are you?

2074
02:13:58,030 --> 02:14:00,114
I'm Capt. Culpeper...

2075
02:14:00,282 --> 02:14:02,408
...of the Santa Rosita
Police Department.

2076
02:14:07,914 --> 02:14:10,416
- [Man] Will you come to the point?
- Yeah, I'm coming to it.

2077
02:14:10,584 --> 02:14:14,295
Point is, I have enough stuff
in my private files...

2078
02:14:14,463 --> 02:14:16,630
...stuff relating to civic building...

2079
02:14:16,798 --> 02:14:20,051
...road contracts,
harbor and cannery projects...

2080
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:22,970
...enough stuff to put you,
the D.A., myself...

2081
02:14:23,138 --> 02:14:27,475
...and a two-thirds majority behind bars
for the next 20 years.

2082
02:14:27,642 --> 02:14:31,645
And I give you my word, that's
exactly where everybody's going...

2083
02:14:31,813 --> 02:14:36,192
...unless things start happening now.
- [Man] Like what, for instance?

2084
02:14:36,359 --> 02:14:39,445
I want the pension
for Culpeper's grade trebled.

2085
02:14:39,613 --> 02:14:43,908
Not doubled, trebled.
I want Culpeper to retire with honor.

2086
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:48,162
I want it on paper that
that's exactly what's going to happen.

2087
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:51,123
And I want it in my hands
in 15 minutes...

2088
02:14:51,291 --> 02:14:54,251
...or I'll have all the reporters
in town in here in 20.

2089
02:14:55,003 --> 02:14:59,256
You know the word for this, Your Honor.
It's called blackmail.

2090
02:15:17,484 --> 02:15:21,237
Sir, could you possibly see
your way clear to give us a break?

2091
02:15:21,404 --> 02:15:23,489
You kidding? Him give you a break?

2092
02:15:23,657 --> 02:15:26,450
We had a pretty rough day already.

2093
02:15:26,618 --> 02:15:30,204
We was all covered with dirt,
and we fell down in an airplane...

2094
02:15:30,372 --> 02:15:32,998
...and my grandmother's dying in Oxnard.

2095
02:15:33,166 --> 02:15:35,376
I know we don't deserve
any kindness, Captain.

2096
02:15:35,544 --> 02:15:39,505
But if you could help us,
I'm sure we'd all be inspired...

2097
02:15:39,673 --> 02:15:41,382
...to live better lives.

2098
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:43,634
Well, there is one thing.

2099
02:15:44,594 --> 02:15:46,929
I don't know
whether it would help or not.

2100
02:15:47,097 --> 02:15:51,433
But if, instead of my turning you in...

2101
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:54,061
...you went and turned yourselves in...

2102
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:58,065
...juries sometimes look very favorably
on things like that.

2103
02:15:58,233 --> 02:16:00,734
[Stammers] You'd let us do that?

2104
02:16:00,902 --> 02:16:03,320
What are we waiting for?
Let's turn ourselves in.

2105
02:16:03,488 --> 02:16:05,072
You must be a fine human being.

2106
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:07,992
After all, why should you worry
whether we get a break?

2107
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:11,245
Well, Mr. Meyer,
no matter what you've all done today...

2108
02:16:11,413 --> 02:16:14,582
...you're not really criminals.
- [Chuckles]

2109
02:16:14,749 --> 02:16:17,668
So if you like,
you can all hop into those two cabs...

2110
02:16:17,836 --> 02:16:20,880
...and drive over to Santa Rosita...

2111
02:16:21,047 --> 02:16:24,258
...and, uh, just walk in.

2112
02:16:24,426 --> 02:16:27,928
- [Stammers] Then let's do that.
- But, sir, we can't all fit.

2113
02:16:28,096 --> 02:16:32,391
You can't take the stolen vehicles.
Those have to stay to be picked up.

2114
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:35,352
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go.

2115
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:37,104
[All chattering]

2116
02:16:37,272 --> 02:16:38,939
Back in the back.

2117
02:16:42,152 --> 02:16:43,194
Drive carefully.

2118
02:16:43,361 --> 02:16:45,905
They may be the last passengers
you'll ever carry.

2119
02:16:46,072 --> 02:16:47,573
Funny. That's funny.

2120
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:48,949
Funny, right? Funny?

2121
02:16:49,117 --> 02:16:51,952
You could be the most
comical cop I ever met.

2122
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:53,245
Yeah.

2123
02:17:20,649 --> 02:17:22,983
- Culpeper.
- [Man] Yes, sir.

2124
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:25,945
Everything is under control here.

2125
02:17:26,112 --> 02:17:29,198
It'll take a little longer
because there was a joker in the deck...

2126
02:17:29,366 --> 02:17:31,825
...that nobody knew about. All right?

2127
02:17:31,993 --> 02:17:33,535
[Man] Yes, sir.

2128
02:17:33,703 --> 02:17:36,872
So don't make a move of any kind
until you hear from me.

2129
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,082
[Man] Yes, sir.

2130
02:17:44,923 --> 02:17:48,926
Listen, why does the man
want to give everybody a break?

2131
02:17:49,094 --> 02:17:52,054
- What's his angle there?
- I was wondering about that, too.

2132
02:17:52,222 --> 02:17:55,849
Something funny's going on.
How's he know what we're going to do?

2133
02:17:56,017 --> 02:17:58,477
We're in enough of a mess.
We better do what he said.

2134
02:17:58,645 --> 02:18:01,021
I'm tellin' you,
the man has got some angle.

2135
02:18:01,189 --> 02:18:02,773
Wait, wait. Hold it!

2136
02:18:02,941 --> 02:18:04,233
Can you see him?

2137
02:18:14,286 --> 02:18:17,913
- Just what does he think he's doing?
- That certainly is strange.

2138
02:18:18,081 --> 02:18:20,165
- Sure is.
- What is he doing?

2139
02:18:20,333 --> 02:18:23,544
- He's going the other way.
- Why are we standing here?

2140
02:18:23,712 --> 02:18:26,630
- That's it!
- [All yelling]

2141
02:18:26,798 --> 02:18:29,049
We're off the hook!

2142
02:18:29,718 --> 02:18:32,386
Get out of here! Come on, we're off!

2143
02:18:32,554 --> 02:18:34,221
Come on, get going.

2144
02:18:38,435 --> 02:18:41,353
[Screaming]

2145
02:18:46,901 --> 02:18:49,737
- Ah!
- Holy mackerel. Almost didn't make it.

2146
02:19:04,836 --> 02:19:07,254
No other cops around. He planned it.

2147
02:19:07,422 --> 02:19:11,300
We found the money and he was waiting
to take it away from us.

2148
02:19:11,468 --> 02:19:15,763
But if we all find the money first
and turn it in, we're all in the clear.

2149
02:19:15,930 --> 02:19:19,099
Let's just get the dough

He's heading for the border!

2157
02:21:12,589 --> 02:21:14,590
We should stop
and call the police station!

2158
02:21:14,757 --> 02:21:15,883
You shut up!

2159
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:18,886
We're going to get that money.
Keep driving!

2160
02:21:19,053 --> 02:21:21,388
That woman is something else.

2161
02:21:21,556 --> 02:21:23,390
Take your foot off the brake!

2162
02:21:23,558 --> 02:21:25,058
Stop hitting me. I'm driving.

2163
02:21:25,226 --> 02:21:28,562
- When you want a cab, you can't get one.
- Yeah, come on, let's go!

2164
02:21:37,572 --> 02:21:39,573
[Man on radio] F-14 to Central.

2165
02:21:39,741 --> 02:21:41,158
Come in. What is it?

2166
02:21:41,326 --> 02:21:42,910
[Man on radio]
There's something phony here.

2167
02:21:43,077 --> 02:21:45,954
We're on 101 by Cortez
checking a mad-dog report.

2168
02:21:46,122 --> 02:21:47,915
Orders were to maintain silence.

2169
02:21:48,082 --> 02:21:50,375
Capt. Culpeper wants
this channel kept clear.

2170
02:21:50,543 --> 02:21:52,252
[Man on radio] We know it,
but we saw Capt. Culpeper.

2171
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:55,464
He just went by doing 90 miles an hour.

2172
02:21:56,341 --> 02:21:58,634
I don't think I understand that.

2173
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:01,094
Are you sure it was Capt. Culpeper?

2174
02:22:01,262 --> 02:22:03,263
- [Man on radio] Yep.
- Was he chasing anybody?

2175
02:22:03,431 --> 02:22:05,974
- [Man on radio] Nope.
- Could he have been chasing anybody?

2176
02:22:06,142 --> 02:22:09,186
[Man on radio] Not a chance.
That's what struck us so funny.

2177
02:22:09,354 --> 02:22:12,397
There were about 15 people
in two cabs behind him.

2178
02:22:12,565 --> 02:22:14,441
It looked like they were chasing him.

2179
02:22:14,609 --> 02:22:17,694
They were chasing him?
What's going on here?

2180

Culp, this is Aloysius speaking.

Now, listen to me, Culp.
Everything has been fixed.

2197
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:28,468
There's been negotiations
and everything is all right.

2198
02:25:28,636 --> 02:25:31,179
Cut out this nonsense and answer me.

2199
02:25:31,347 --> 02:25:33,348
This is Aloysius speaking.

...will very likely get off lightly...

2308
02:35:39,079 --> 02:35:43,333

me up there to throw the book at.
