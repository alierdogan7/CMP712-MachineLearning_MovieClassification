1
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,773
Michael!

2
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,953
Make that change.

3
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:51,915
On July 7, these five brothers will begin
their summer tour of one-nighters...

4
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,708
in Madison Square Garden.

5
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,756
Yes, I'm The Real Don Steele,
and here's the Jackson 5.

6
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,849
I hope you caught these kids
on The Ed Sullivan Show last night.

7
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,224
From the fact-is-stranger-than-fiction
department:

8
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,855
Michael Jackson
has built a shrine to Elizabeth Taylor...

9
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,796
in the bedroom of his Encino home.

10
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,960
Michael Jackson was admitted
with severe burns to his scalp...

11
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,128
as far as we know.

12
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,364
Michael Jackson.

13
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,305
The Guinness Book of World Records
has listedThriller...

14
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,139
as the biggest-selling album of all time.

15
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,476
Michael Jackson has become
the first artist in the history of music...

16
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,449
to generate six
number-one singles off one album.

17
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,314
The album of course is Bad.

18
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,379
What Michael Jackson has achieved
is a tribute to 20 years of hard work...

19
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,549
energy, tireless dedication.

20
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,560
Your success
is an American dream come true.

21
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,132
- And the winner is...
- Beat It, Michael Jackson.

22
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,226
Billie Jean, Michael Jackson.

23
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,999
Thriller. Quincy Jones
and Michael Jackson.

24
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,646
So what's up?

25
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,820
Who's bad?

26
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,345
So that's the way it goes down?

27
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,044
Good afternoon
and welcome to our studio tour.

28
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,078
I must ask you that no photos be taken,
and please do not feed the performers.

29
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,316
Thank you.

30
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,717
- Is Bubbles in my trailer?
- Yes, sir.

31
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,557
What is he wearing?

32
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,496
He's wearing a Prince T-shirt
and red sneakers.

33
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,658
Prince T-shirt?

34
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,362
While on the tour,
please do not startle the performers...

35
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,269
as that jarring
can disturb their breeding habits.

36
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,400
Little studio humor there.

37
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,534
Have you seen
any famous people, Timmy?

38
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,373
No, not yet, Grammy.

39
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,471
Can somebody get me
a banana-cream pie after lunch?

40
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,674
What if they're out?

41
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,651
- Can they make me one?
- Consider it done, MJ.

42
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,447
- What's with all the smoke?
- Movie stuff, sir.

43
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,921
Look, Grammy, it's...

44
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:21,038
- Mantovani?
- No, Michael Jackson!

45
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,090
Excuse me.

46
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,277
Land of the free.

47
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,508
Home of the weird.

48
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,279
Wonder if they caught him.

49
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,618
- Which way did they go?
- I don't know.

50
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,092
Look, Biff, there he is.

51
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,558
Hey, buddy, how about an autograph?

52
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,963
Would you autograph my tummy?

53
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,070
What's the matter, you got no pen?

54
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,966
Let's get him!

55
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,236
Come on, buddy, just one little autograph.

56
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,732
Draw, you tin-horned, lily-livered,
side-winding snail!

57
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,201
Cut!

58
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,179
You hairball! I'll never finish this movie!

59
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,009
Who let him in? Isn't anybody in charge?

60
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,382
Don't you know anything
about show business?

61
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,477
I'm sorry.

62
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,217
My producer is doing this to me, isn't he?
I asked for a bad guy...

63
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,751
and he gives me Michael Jackson.
I can't take it anymore! I quit!

64
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:28,129
Peckerwood, you're going to
ruin my career. I'll show you bad.

65
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,228
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

66
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,072
Let's get the varmint!

67
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,977
I love you, Michael!

68
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,018
There he goes!

69
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:00,990
We'll wait forever to get a shot at this guy.
He's tough to shoot.

70
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,628
Hey, songbird!

71
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:10,436
- That's him.
- I've had enough of seeing you on my set.

72
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,148
I think he's in there.

73
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,617
Wait a minute, let me get around.

74
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,015
I can hear him.

75
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,459
I hear him.

76
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,164
It's awful quiet in there.

77
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,292
He's here.

78
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,894
The door's opening. Set your focus.

79
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,345
Stupid rabbit.

80
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,973
- Get out of the way, rabbit!
- Get out of here.

81
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,710
He must be hiding.

82
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,755
- Look over there.
- Look at that bunny.

83
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,255
Bag that bunny.

84
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,099
It's him!

85
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,747
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right.

86
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,959
Me and my friend Spike, we were just...

87
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,034
My friend, he was just...

88
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:49,335
- Spike. He was just here...
- I need your autograph right here.

89
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,473
- Hi, David!
- Hi, Mary Beth!

90
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,705
Hi, neighbor!

91
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,421
What are you stopping for?

92
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,430
- That star over there.
- So what? Keep moving.

93
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,359
Maybe that's his lucky star.

94
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,330
- He needs one.
- Quit worrying, Katie. Come on.

95
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,373
What a pal.

96
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,007
Hey, Zeke, over here.

97
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,741
Hey, let me see.

98
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,220
- Let's get out of here!
- Katie, come on!

99
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,212
Katie, come on.

100
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,462
It's about time you threw it to me.

101
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,585
Skipper, come back here.

102
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,952
Katie, let's go. Come on.

103
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,026
Hurry up. Come on.

104
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,527
- Michael, where'd he go?
- He went in the woods over here.

105
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,706
Oh, my God! Look at this.

106
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,686
I don't like spiders.

107
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,122
Wait a minute.

108
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,672
No, Michael.

109
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,311
Katie, it's okay.

110
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,756
You got to be real quiet.

111
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,903
Okay, let's see.

112
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,204
Real quiet, okay?

113
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,312
Europe, Asia...

114
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,476
Miami, New York. Cocaine, crack.

115
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,350
San Francisco...

116
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,649
heroin and speed.

117
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,761
You guys gotta hit the middle
of this country.

118
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,130
Get in the middle of the country.

119
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:52,931
Stop those kids from praying in school.

120
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:56,336
First, I want you to hang around
by playgrounds, school yards.

121
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,235
You got to remember,
a younger customer...

122
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,108
always turns into a loyal customer.
Remember that!

123
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,739
He can't be doing that.

124
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,875
Every kid in school
will have to take drugs because of me.

125
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,352
I want everybody to know. Everybody.

126
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:14,687
My name is gonna be in history books.
They better spell my name right.

127
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:18,426
L-l-D-E-O. So simple.

128
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,732
Frankie Lideo. Very easy.

129
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,400
Bugs and drugs.

130
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,067
Smooth operation, that's what I got.

131
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:32,734
What?

132
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,418
Up there!

133
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,959
That was good. That was just great.

134
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,134
Okay, let's sweep him up now. Come on.

135
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,271
Where is he?

136
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,648
There! Come on, get him!

137
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,245
Kill him! Move!

138
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,385
Let's see how cool he is now!

139
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,531
Now, let's go! Move it!

140
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,703
Split up. Spread out, boys!

141
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:17,213
Come on. Hurry up.

142
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:52,675
Cover everything!

143
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,751
I want reports. I'm not
hearing anything back to me.

144
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,230
Block off the streets. Block them off.

145
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:12,598
Double back. Keep moving around,
you'll trap him that way.

146
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,942
Come on, move it, I'm not
hearing any reports back here!

147
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,279
Split up! Get your men all over!

148
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,198
Block off tunnels, he's a rat.

149
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,634
Shoot anything that moves!

150
00:46:56,447 --> 00:47:00,281
What's that? Did you get him?
I heard gunfire. Did you get him?

151
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:08,106
He's gotta be somewhere around here.
He's gotta be here, he didn't get out.

152
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,510
Move! Move it!

153
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:14,821
Cover that side. All right!

154
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,519
Bring in the artillery!

155
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:20,586
I want everybody in this squad.
Pull out all the new hardware on him.

156
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,629
I want this one messy.

157
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,435
Turn him into a stain on the concrete!

158
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:30,398
Look for that little cockroach, too.
She's around here somewhere.

159
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,733
Give me that.

160
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,716
There he is. Hold it.

161
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,185
He's not going anywhere.

162
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,889
Now there's no way out of there,
don't screw it up.

163
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,877
Come on, let's go!

164
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,721
All right, come on!

165
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,319
What are you waiting for?
It's only one guy.

166
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,144
All right, come on. It's a car, that's all it is.

167
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,314
What are you waiting for?

168
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,709
Fire!

169
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:39,293
What's that? Who was that? What is it?

170
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:43,162
Get him! Go get him!

171
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,212
Get him. Come on, get him!

172
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,024
- Michael?
- Katie, are you okay?

173
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,229
- Michael got away.
- No way.

174
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,364
He told us to meet him here, right?

175
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,430
Yeah.

176
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,335
This place?

177
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,089
Nobody's been here for years.

178
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,258
It's kind of spooky.

179
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,572
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

180
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,508
I think maybe
we came to the wrong place.

181
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,815
It says Club 30's.

182
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,044
Hey, you guys, something's coming.

183
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,351
- You scare everybody!
- Shut up.

184
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,931
- So, what'd you see?
- Come on. This isn't good.

185
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,977
Hello, is anybody there? Hello?

186
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:04,145
Man, are you okay? Come on.
Tell us what you saw.

187
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,340
- Michael.
- So?

188
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:16,364
That's cool.

189
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:20,207
- I taught him everything he knows.
- Oh, yeah, right, you show me.

190
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,574
Okay, sure. Hold this.

191
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:06,575
Come on!

192
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,014
Give me that.

193
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,487
They got Katie, man.
They grabbed and took her away.

194
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:17,788
- I was in there! I was right in there.
- Lf we move too quick...

195
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,226
- Which way did they go?
- They went over here.

196
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,594
- Look!
- Don't touch it!

197
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:23,859
Oh, no.

198
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,535
- Michael, you gotta help her.
- What can he do?

199
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,829
You'll see what I can do.

200
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,241
You'll see.

201
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:45,547
Stay back.

202
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,087
Is anybody up there?

203
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,124
Watch your step.

204
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,031
Peanuts?

205
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,208
Over here.

206
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,011
How are we gonna get to him?

207
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,711
What are you doing?

208
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:19,809
I'm trying to get a lucky star for Michael.

209
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,547
Why don't we go get the cops instead?

210
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,957
- No!
- Shut up! Shut it!

211
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,689
- Michael, help.
- Shut up.

212
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,133
Stop crying. Get over here.

213
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:46,298
- Let her go.
- Shut up.

214
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:49,340
Don't you talk to me! You shut up!

215
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,408
Why are you doing this? Stop it!

216
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,540
You wanna know why
I'm doing this to you? You be quiet!

217
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:59,912
I just wanna get everybody high, man.
You know, some good drugs.

218
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,087
- After all...
- Do it and you're dead.

219
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:06,995
Let's give her a shot of this.

220
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:09,324
Listen, man...

221
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,098
No!

222
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,264
Get up!

223
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,867
This isn't so smooth now, is it?

224
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,404
Now, get out of here.

225
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,644
Where you going, brat? Little cockroach.

226
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,548
Kill her first!

227
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:36,088
- Shut up!
- Leave her alone!

228
01:07:58,474 --> 01:07:59,600
Amazing.

229
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,815
Fire!

230
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,370
Fire!

231
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,487
Bring on everything!

232
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:25,892
You men, get him!

233
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,400
Oh, no!

234
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:07,086
Where are you, you tin-headed creep?
Where are you?

235
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:10,582
Hold it, I got you.

236
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:19,029
Stay there, I have something for you.

237
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,260
Gotcha!

238
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,376
Oh, no!

239
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,410
I got you, tin-head.

240
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,857
Okay, where's that cockroach brat?

241
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,599
Okay, kiddies, I've got you.

242
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:55,664
Who's it now? Who is it?

243
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:19,980
- Where's he going?
- He's leaving.

244
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,122
Goodbye, Michael.

245
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,929
Thank you, Michael.

246
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,595
Bye.

247
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,593
Feels weird without him, huh?

248
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,665
He saved our lives.

249
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,536
I'm gonna miss him.

250
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:19,675
Me, too.

251
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,128
I made this star
to remember Michael with.

252
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,621
His lucky star.

253
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:38,460
Yeah.

254
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:41,735
It's is not his lucky star. It's gone.

255
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:53,347
Not your lucky star, it's not.

256
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,489
I wish he would come back.

257
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,157
You're back!

258
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,430
You came back.

259
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:56,336
You're back. You came back.

260
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,412
I'm so happy to see you.

261
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:04,175
You know I had to come back, Sean.

262
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:07,045
Come on, let's go.

263
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,823
This is so exciting.

264
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,358
We're going back to the club?

265
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:15,622
- What's gonna be in here this time?
- You'll see, Zeke. You'll like this.

266
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,695
Everybody get ready.

267
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,230
- Ready?
- Yeah.

268
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,242
Where are we going?

269
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,453
- Stay together, you'll see.
- What's all this stuff?

270
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:41,887
Don't worry, I'm gonna show you
something special.

271
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,789
Keep going.

272
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,084
What's that?

273
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:50,788
- I think I heard something.
- You didn't hear anything.

274
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:55,625
- You know something you're not telling.
- It's a surprise.

275
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:59,538
- Are there spiders?
- There are no spiders in here.

276
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:03,007
- I wanna see some rats.
- There are no rats in here.

277
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:08,079
- What's down there?
- Nothing. We're going ahead.

278
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,681
It's just a plug.

279
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:17,315
Yeah, you jumped back, too.

280
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,087
Go around this way.

281
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:25,898
Mike, where've you been?
We have one minute.

282
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:27,628
Let's go.

283
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:31,065
Hey, kids, I think I found a friend of yours.

284
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,070
Hey, Skipper.

285
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,981
- Come on with me.
- Come on, Skipper.

286
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,749
Where have you been, MJ?

287
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:35,172
English
