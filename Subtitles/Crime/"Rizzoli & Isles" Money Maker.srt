1
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,692
Welcome. I'm a Rhodium.

2
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:15,635
I'm just Iridium.

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,140
That's fine. I'm not a snob.
Sit down.

4
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,124
- You know what to do?
- I've been instructed, yes.

5
00:00:31,158 --> 00:00:34,862
I'm very used to this. Don't be afraid.

6
00:00:34,897 --> 00:00:36,897
I'm not.

7
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:48,741
Oh, my god! Are you okay?

8
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:04,048
A joy of controlling
how the hot water rises

9
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:08,562
before a torrent of pressure
penetrates the tamped beans.

10
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:11,833
Okay, I'm done watching
coffee porn.

11
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:17,171
How did instant get in my cupboard?

12
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:19,440
You are so impatient!

13
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:23,145
Maura, I just want a cup of coffee,
not a roman orgy. 

14
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:25,547
- Morning. Morning.
- Oh!

15
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:28,517
Where are you going ...
a garden party?

16
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:30,651
- Going to work.
- Like that?

17
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:33,446
I think she looks beautiful.
And I love your shoes.

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,505
I haven't worn
high heels in a while.

19
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:38,640
30 years is more than "a while."

20
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:41,109
You know, there's a trick
to wearing high heels.

21
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:43,111
Yeah, I know ...
don't wear them.

22
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,580
Just slip these into your shoes.

23
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:48,217
- I can wear heels all day long with them.
- Yeah, she runs in hers.

24
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:53,422
Nice. Oh.

25
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:55,124
- Other one.
- See? It's easy.

26
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,660
How's that?

27
00:01:57,695 --> 00:01:59,829
Nice.

28
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:02,731
And gushy.
Thanks.

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,299
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

30
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,700
I think my mom has
a gentleman caller.

31
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:12,838
- Your mother is a beautiful woman.
- My mother flosses in bed.

32
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,379
Oh. It's Hope.

33
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:23,415
- Answer it.
- What do I say?

34
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,418
"Hello, biological Mom Hope.

35
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:29,086
- My name is Maura. I didn't die at birth."
- Shut up.

36
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:30,722
No, you shouldn't say, "shut up."

37
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:32,456
Dr. Isles.

38
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:35,360
Oh, hello, Dr. Martin.
What a surprise.

39
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:41,367
Oh, yes, I-I would love
to have dinner with you.

40
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,370
Tonight would be great.

41
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:46,572
Uh, would you like to
come over to my house?

42
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,641
Sure, you ...
you can bring your daughter.

43
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:51,177
Okay, I ...
I will text you my address.

44
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:54,780
I-I look forward to it.
Okay, bye-bye.

45
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:57,517
Oh, my gosh.

46
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,252
Why did I invite them here?
The place is a wreck.

47
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:01,521
Oh, I'd be so embarrassed

48
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:04,324
- to invite anyone but me here.
- And what will I serve?

49
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:08,361
I mean, she probably has a more refined
palate than me.

50
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:11,364
Oh, saved by murder. Come on.

51
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,766
No, no, I-I can't go.
I have way too much to do.

52
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,503
Okay, I think I can
do an autopsy by now.

53
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,271
Well, I to take have a shower.

54
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:19,806
Maura.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,741
Hot water gets shut off
in three minutes.

56
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:26,312
Bathroom's that way.
Running.

57

<b>3x06 - Money Maker</b>

59
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:54,006
Wow. 3 million bucks?
Wow.

60
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:57,910
I didn't even ask her if she's a vegan.
What if she's allergic to shellfish?

61
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,646
- You just said she's a vegan.
- No, I did not.

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,915
You know, I can't pull
together a formal dinner

63
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,650
in ... what ... 10 hours.

64
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:07,319
Yeah, considering it takes you
4 hours to make a cup of coffee.

65
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,656
No. No, no, no, not
with the heavy breathing.

66
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,992
- No, stop, and I'll help you.
- I'm trying.

67
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:16,127
Okay, you call my mother.
All right? You flatter her.

68
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:17,362
You tell her what a great cook she is.

69
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:19,597
She eats that up.
She'll cook for you.

70
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:21,933
- Oh, it's such an imposition.
- Not if you invite her to dinner.

71
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:25,971
Somebody's Mercedes
got a parking ticket.

72
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,673
You run the plates?
What do we got?

73
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,941
A couple looking at
the house called police.

74
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:32,744
The real-estate agent is a handful.

75
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:34,179
Yay.

76
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:36,220
Is this your listing?
It's a beautiful property.

77
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:38,816
Georgette Wilkins. I have
many other properties.

78
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,286
It's all the exclusive
neighborhoods. Give me a call.

79
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,726
What makes you think I can't
afford a $3 million dollar home?

80
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:55,899
Well, cops' salaries...
never mind.

81
00:04:55,933 --> 00:05:00,062
This house went into foreclosure
a year ago, while it was being renovated.

82
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,053
I almost had a sale.
Is all this really necessary?

83
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,813
Pretty necessary when there's a murder.

84
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,315
It wasn't a murder.

85
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,983
I'd say it's at least
a piece of a murder.

86
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:12,918
Division Detectives didn't
know what to make of it.

87
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:16,821
It's the entire
right fossa triangularis and the scapha.

88
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:18,756
You hear that, Korsak?

89
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,857
It's a whole fossil
triangle and a scaffold.

90
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,091
It's the right ear.

91
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,994
- Why is it 3 feet off the ground?
- It's listening through the keyhole?

92
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:27,862
Well, the minimum of blood

93
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:31,232
suggests that this ear
was detached postmortem.

94
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,873
Got a drop of blood out here.

95
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:38,210
It's not much, but I got
another drop over here.

96
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:40,044
- Hey, Jane.
- Yeah?

97
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,745
Mercedes is registered to Neal Murray.

98
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:47,149
And what's his car doing here
if he lives in Beacon Hill?

99
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:50,251
Do you know this man ...
Neal Murray?

100
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,886
No. Never seen him before.

101
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,322
Look, I have another listing.
You have my card.

102
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,259
- Run her.
- Got it.

103
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:05,229
You think there's a body
in the trunk of that car?

104
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:14,403
Georgette's clean.

105
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,338
Wait! Stop!

106
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:19,274
Stop! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop! Put it down.

107
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:21,843
<i>Okay. There you go.</i>

108
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:28,149
He appears to be
wearing a cloak and a mask.

109
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:29,350
I think we found the body
that goes to that ear.

110
00:06:29,385 --> 00:06:33,220
I'm not prepared to say conclusively
until I've tested tissue samples.

111
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:38,023
- Maura, he's got one ear.
- Looks like Neal Murray.

112
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:41,292
Something bad went down in that house.

113
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:55,777
Turns out our victim co-owns
an investment company.

114
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:58,279
What's a millionaire hedge-fund manager

115
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:02,049
doing in a garbage can
in a mask and a cloak?

116
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:03,451
Hiding?

117
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:06,588
Thank you, Sherlock Holmes.

118
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:09,160
What's this on his cloak?
It looks like jelly.

119
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,585
I'll have the crime lab test it.

120
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,603
Ooh, you got a treasure trove over here.
Where'd you find the blond hair?

121
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:20,074
- It was caught in this pin.
- Which is stamped "Rhodium."

122
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,343
Rhodium is a rare metal ...
the most valuable, in fact.

123
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:23,744
Hmm, the plot thickens.

124
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:29,083
My preliminary examination indicates
that he experienced a cardiac event.

125
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:30,551
It was quite an event.

126
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,452
Yeah, well, you haven't
heard the best part.

127
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,721
Let's talk about his penis.

128
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:36,456
If we must.

129
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,726
Not seeing much to talk about.

130
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,164
- You see the needle marks?
- No! I didn't look that close.

131
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,866
Consistent with treatment
for erectile dysfunction.

132
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,302
It's too bad he didn't
hear about viagra.

133
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,404
His heart condition prohibited it.

134
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:53,641
18 million american men suffer
from erectile dysfunction.

135
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,643
Injection therapy is very popular.

136
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:58,647
Oh, sure, yeah. Who doesn't
want to shoot up their privates?

137
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,120
The victim was left-handed.

138
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:04,457
I found seven injection sites
high on the left side of the shaft.

139
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:07,794
But the last injection site
was low on the right side.

140
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:10,397
So, a right-handed person injected him.

141
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:12,332
And the needle gauge
was much bigger, too.

142
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,268
Find out what was in that final
syringe. 

143
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:16,470
Until we know, we can't
call this a murder.

144
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:20,341
Okay, I'm gonna go interview
his business partner.

145
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,510
Call me if you find something new.

146
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:32,471
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.

147
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:34,140
This is Detective Barry Frost.

148
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:36,142
We'd like to talk to
you about Neal Murray.

149
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:38,578
What happened? We don't
know. We're investigating.

150
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:41,048
I'm his partner, Dale Bowman.
This is Doug and Lori Gatz.

151
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:43,450
Doug and I went to high
school right here with Neal.

152
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,052
Well, then, Neal was
supposed to be here today?

153
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,485
Yes, he was gonna give us a check

154
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,385
for a new athletic
complex and football field.

155
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,320
Hey, Doug, you'll get that check.

156
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:53,122
I can't believe he's gone.

157
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,291
- Could you give us a minute?
- Sure.

158
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:59,161
Uh, where were you last night?

159
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:02,097
- Home. Why?
- Any idea why your partner

160
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:03,331
would have been dressed
in a cloak and a mask?

161
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:04,599
No. What are you talking about?

162
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,467
Were you having any problems with Neal?

163
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:08,235
I loved the guy.

164
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:10,137
Plus, don't know if our company
will survive without him.

165
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:12,538
- Why not?
- He was a real people person.

166
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,941
He brought in all our big investors.

167
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:18,078
- We'd like a list of your clients.
- Oh, I'm happy to cooperate.

168
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:21,715
We have very high-end clients,
all the way down to Doug and Lori.

169
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,550
He's a coach.
She's the school nurse.

170
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:26,220
But they both have
pensions, thanks to us.

171
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:27,688
Maybe there was a
disgruntled investor ...

172
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:29,256
someone who lost money with the firm?

173
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,092
We don't lose money.

174
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:34,261
Somebody wasn't too happy with Neal.

175
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:36,230
It wasn't one of our investors.
That much I know.

176
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:37,364
I'll get that list for you.

177
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:38,999
Thank you.

178
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:41,669
We'll be in touch.

179
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:49,827
Take the gnocchi out of the
hot water, or it'll get sticky.

180
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:52,097
Jane, stir the wild-boar ragout.

181
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:54,799
Jane, can you open the Montepulciano?

182
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,068
Stirring boar.
Opening "montipoopanano."

183
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:01,473
Oh, my god. They're a minute early.

184
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:07,443
Oh, my god.
What if she saw this?

185
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:11,179
Just a minute!
Hide it in the bathroom.

186
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:14,416
Okay. Okay, okay.

187
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:20,422
Maura.

188
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:30,366
- Hi.
- Come in, please.

189
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,269
Dr. Isles.
This is my daughter, Cailin.

190
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:36,805
- Hi, Cailin.
- Hey.

191
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:42,309
And I think that we really are
settling into a ... a new city.

192
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:48,449
- Right, Cailin?
- Yeah. We are.

193
00:10:48,484 --> 00:10:51,353
- How do you like Boston?
- I ... I miss London.

194
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:54,990
Honey, would you stop texting?

195
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:57,525
Sorry.
I'm just saying goodbye.

196
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,028
Are you in school?

197
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:03,332
- I was.
- Cailin was at Oxford.

198
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:07,369
- Oh.
- And you're not anymore?

199
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:09,838
- Well ...
- We had to move here.

200
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:13,292
Well, she needs to take a semester off.

201
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:16,093
Excuse me.
May I use your bathroom?

202
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:18,729
Of course. It's ...
it's right over there.

203
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:31,705
It's a complicated relationship ...
mothers and daughters.

204
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,641
Yes, it is.

205
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,243
- It's a phase.
- I hope so.

206
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,614
Cailin just misses her friends.
She doesn't know anyone here in Boston.

207
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,651
Tell me, did your mother
teach you how to cook?

208
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:49,055
- Actually, Angela made dinner.
- Well, it is delicious.

209
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:50,789
- Thank you.
- Mm.

210
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:54,325
My mother ... uh, she didn't
spend much time in the kitchen.

211
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:58,062
Uh, Maura's mother is an artist
and an art-history professor,

212
00:11:58,097 --> 00:11:59,897
so she traveled a lot.

213
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:02,333
I traveled a lot when
Cailin was young, too.

214
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,035
Her father's my ex-husband....

215
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:09,106
he ... he had financial issues,
so I always had to work.

216
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,209
- That's hard.
- Look, Cailin's back.

217
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:14,878
I think I'll use your ladies' room, too.

218
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:16,379
Ah, good idea.

219
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,985
Cailin hates me.

220
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,721
She's 18.

221
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:30,924
She hates everybody over 18...
and under 18.

222
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,259
She's my sister, Jane.

223
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,195
Even when they know
they're related to you,

224
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,863
families are still complicated.

225
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:54,185
- Hey. This is pretty good.
- Oh, no, thank you.

226
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:57,088
Really? Not even one bite?

227
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,369
What are you listening to?

228
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,072
Oh. Music.

229
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:15,372
What kind of bands do you like?

230
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:22,444
It was nice of you to bring
the cake over. But it's okay.

231
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:24,680
You don't have to try to engage with me.

232
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:25,747
Are we that awful?

233
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,785
Will you tell my Mom
that I decided to walk home?

234
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:32,820
Wait, what?

235
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,689
It's not personal.
I just would like to be alone.

236
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:48,101
- Was that Cailin?
- She said she wanted to be alone.

237
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:52,839
Did Cailin leave?
Are you leaving?

238
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:57,010
She's very fragile right now.
Thank you for dinner. I'm so sorry.

239
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:04,819
What the hell just happened?

240
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:16,466
I don't think Cailin should have
been forced to have dinner with us. 

241
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:18,535
Why weren't you this
evolved when I was 18?

242
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:23,807
Smells so good.

243
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,910
I'm so sorry about last night.

244
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:30,080
Why? It wasn't your fault.

245
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:31,648
What is that?

246
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:33,550
A chilled lavender towel.
Put it on your neck.

247
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:35,352
- No.
- It's very soothing.

248
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:38,489
It's used for treating amenorrhea,
athlete's foot, vaginitis.

249
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:40,657
I'm eating.
I don't need to be soothed.

250
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:42,759
Our victim's tox report came back.

251
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:45,629
No sign of his
erectile-dysfunction medication.

252
00:14:45,663 --> 00:14:46,730
Still eating.

253
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,466
He was injected with something.
What was it?

254
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,669
I'm still testing.
I dissected his heart tissue.

255
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:55,139
And whatever drug was injected
did cause a heart attack.

256
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:58,174
There you are.

257
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,710
Hello, Dr. Martin. Hi.

258
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:03,479
<i>Have a fabulous day. Call me later.</i>

259
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:05,815
Hi.

260
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:12,489
- I feel the need to apologize for Cailin.
- No, please don't.

261
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:15,525
You know, I was 18 once,
and her life has been disrupted.

262
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:18,594
It's all right. I ...
I just feel bad for you.

263
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:25,467
Cailin is actually very ill, which
is why I brought her back to Boston.

264
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:30,639
Have a seat.

265
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:35,143
With what?
Can you say?

266
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:39,514
She contracted a bacterial infection
while I was doing relief work in Africa.

267
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:40,849
You can't blame yourself.

268
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:44,219
She's in desperate need
of a kidney transplant.

269
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:46,588
And of course, I would give her
one of my own in a heartbeat,

270
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:49,858
but... we're not a match.

271
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:54,329
And neither is her father.

272
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:55,897
It is so ironic.

273
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:59,935
I've helped so many patients,
and I cannot help my own child.

274
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,937
There must be something that I can do.

275
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,242
No, there isn't, but I
so appreciate the thought.

276
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,252
Got something.

277
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:22,290
Our victim was treated for chest pains
last week at the E.R. in Dedham.

278
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,893
Neal's next of kin is "heavy drizzle"?

279
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:27,330
- Who's that?
- Whoever took him to the hospital, I guess.

280
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:30,334
"Heavy drizzle"? The Drizz?
The famous crunk rapper?

281
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:34,205
Okay, check the list of
investors from Murray & Bowman.

282
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:35,740
See if "the Drizz" is on it.

283
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:38,342
I think his real name is Lamar Jones.

284
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:40,344
He once renegotiated
a recording contract

285
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:41,945
by hanging an executive from
his ankles off a balcony.

286
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:51,756
The Drizz!
"Crunk in the trunk" ... I love that song.

287
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:04,636
Okay, stop, stop.

288
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,405
What? Okay, Frankie.

289
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,307
- Stop, stop. Just...
- What?

290
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:10,276
- That's not how it goes, man.
- Aw.

291
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,344
If you're gonna do it, let
me show you how it's done.

292
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,746
All right.

293
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,649
All right, okay, so, it's, like,
side to side. Start side to side.

294
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:18,317
- Like this?
- Yeah.

295
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:19,619
- And then you just start to walk.
- I'm walking.

296
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:23,322
Okay, and then get ready.
Get ready. And then "aah!"

297
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:25,424
And then you bring this.
Yeah, there you go. Yes!

298
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,359
- You start smacking that.
- Smack it.

299
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:32,462
I'll show you thunk!

300
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:34,698
How's that? Would you
like some more thunk?

301
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:36,532
Keep doing that with your behinds.

302
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:42,470
I expect this
behavior from you, Francesco.

303
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:45,340
But not you, Barold.

304
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:47,776
- Why does she expect it from me?
- She likes Barold.

305
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,645
No idea why.

306
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,516
Let's get Mr. Drizzle
in here for questioning.

307
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,451
- Where you going, Jane?
- I got to go check on Maura.

308
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:05,395
Is that last night's dessert,
and am I about to get sick?

309
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:09,366
- I think we're a match.
- You're not really my type.

310
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,834
Me and Cailin.

311
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:14,337
I think we're having
different conversations.

312
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:15,772
Cailin needs a kidney.

313
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:18,908
So, you going to make
it out of that cake?

314
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:22,512
Of course not. I needed
a sample of her DNA.

315
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:24,680
Y-you can't give her a kidney.

316
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:27,316
It's my kidney.
I can give it to whomever I please.

317
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,751
Oh, so, you told Hope?

318
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,789
I'm going to donate anonymously.

319
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:38,027
You need any help getting it out, or
are you gonna do that by yourself, too?

320
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:39,695
What ... no, Maura.
What are you thinking? No!

321
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:42,698
Cailin's dying, Jane.
And Hope is overwhelmed.

322
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,433
The last thing she needs is to relive

323
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:48,571
the worst event of her life ...
my birth ... and death.

324
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:51,541
I guess I just don't get it.

325
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,914
If I ...
if I tell her who I am ...

326
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:01,518
I'll be a reminder of her tragic past.

327
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,521
I'll never be anything else to her.

328
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:10,995
- What? You only need one kidney.
- You're incredible.

329
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:13,731
You'd do the same for
one of your brothers.

330
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:17,468
Maybe.
They'd have to be really, really nice.

331
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,871
I'd definitely do it for you, though.

332
00:19:24,474 --> 00:19:26,511
<i>Your wretched lyrics </i>

333
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:28,413
with tail shaking and behind flapping,

334
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:32,418
<i>violent metaphors and images.
And you know something, mister?</i>

335
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:33,986
Children are dying because of you.

336
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,323
- Shaking booty never killed nobody.
- "Anybody."

337
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:43,462
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>

338
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,764
That's a family-assistance counselor.

339
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:48,467
What kind of assistance
that sister offering?

340
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:53,072
Come on, Drizz.
Uh, posse waits downstairs.

341
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:56,442
- Frost?
- Hold on.

342
00:19:56,476 --> 00:20:00,345
Uh, can I come?
Please?

343
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,882
All right, stand there
and don't open your mouth.

344
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:10,189
Nah, I ain't never met that dude.

345
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:13,159
That dude is your investment
adviser ... Neal Murray.

346
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:15,430
I got a lot of advisers.

347
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,864
Who advises you in murder?

348
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:20,001
Damn. Who did that man like that?

349
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:22,170
Maybe you.
Did he lose your money?

350
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:23,838
You're not a gangster anymore, Drizz.

351
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:27,108
You're a businessman
with a multimillion-dollar empire.

352
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,111
This kind of publicity
wouldn't be good for your brand.

353
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:34,116
Uh...
okay, Neal was my money man.

354
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,419
He brought me into his firm.

355
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:38,087
A diversified portfolio provides a buffer

356
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:41,424
against the vicissitudes
of the music industry,

357
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,426
So we were ...

358
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:45,428
What?
A homeboy can't know finance?

359
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:48,565
Let's talk about your visit
with Neal to the E.R., yo.

360
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,300
Look, Neal was a good dude.

361
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:54,871
He knew how to have crazy-ass fun,
but I needed my liquid capital back.

362
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:59,843
Neal said Dale wouldn't let
me have my own damn money back.

363
00:20:59,877 --> 00:21:01,511
I'm still not hearing
anything about the E.R.

364
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:06,049
All right, I took Neal for
a spin on I-90 in my donk... yo.

365
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,953
Actually, it's my screen saver.

366
00:21:11,456 --> 00:21:13,557
Nice. 28-inch chrome rims.

367
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:17,427
Officer... this is an interview.

368
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:20,096
How fast were you going in your... donk?

369
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,198
Oh, 55.

370
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:29,939
All right, all right.
Maybe a ... above 55.

371
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:31,875
Neal said it was giving him chest pains.

372
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:33,142
That's what you were
hoping for, wasn't it?

373
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:35,278
You told him you'd
take him to the hospital

374
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:37,113
if he'd give you your money back?

375
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:40,216
Eh, yeah...
something like that.

376
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,618
Neal told me not to tell Dale.

377
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:45,254
Neal gave me the money
out of his own pocket.

378
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,992
I feel like talking to old Dale again.

379
00:21:52,462 --> 00:21:55,565
I'm ... I'm sorry
about playing that rap.

380
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,702
I've taught children for 55 years.

381
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,238
Some of the poorest
neighborhoods in the city.

382
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:03,639
It must have been challenging.

383
00:22:03,673 --> 00:22:08,243
It was that, but it was also rewarding.
It was my life's work.

384
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:15,718
That's Dontrell.
He was in the last class I taught.

385
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,555
He was the loveliest,
sweetest little boy.

386
00:22:19,189 --> 00:22:20,390
"Was"?

387
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:23,660
He died...
in a drive-by shooting.

388
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:25,962
Excuse me. I'm fighting a cold.

389
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,799
- I understand.
- Oh, yeah?

390
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,670
You understand the virus that's baffled
scientists for hundreds of years?

391
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,772
We're both trying to save the world.

392
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:37,241
Well, I couldn't save Dontrell.

393
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:40,677
- Stand back.
- What?

394
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:42,613
Take care of yourself, sister.

395
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:53,024
We'd like to talk to
you about Lamar Jones.

396
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:54,525
Who?

397
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,761
You might know him as Heavy Drizzle.
He's one of your investors.

398
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:59,597
Oh, yeah. Drizz.
Sure, I know him.

399
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:01,799
Why'd you make it so hard for him
to get his money out of your firm?

400
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,268
I run a hedge fund, Detectives.

401
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:07,538
I make a lot of money for
my clients if, and only if,

402
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:10,008
I lock in their money for a set period.

403
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:12,276
Did you know Neal gave
Drizz his money back?

404
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:15,713
I think it's time to tell
you to talk to my lawyer.

405
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:21,787
Have a nice day.

406
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:24,824
You see his key chain?

407
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:26,459
Just like the one we found on Neal.

408
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:31,030
Murray & Bowman's financial
statements are bogus.

409
00:23:31,064 --> 00:23:32,498
There's no way they're
getting these returns.

410
00:23:32,532 --> 00:23:33,866
This looks like a Ponzi scheme.

411
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,568
Explains why Dale

412
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:36,736
didn't want investors like
Drizz pulling their money out.

413
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:42,608
I know why Dale and our victim
carried the same key fob.

414
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:43,876
It's a flash drive.

415
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:50,615
Hmm.
It's taking me to a website.

416
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,386
10preciousmetals.com.

417
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:00,025
I'm in.

418
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,097
Neal was running an
underground sex club.

419
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,034
Drizz said old Neal knew
how to have "crazy-ass fun."

420
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:12,505
"To upgrade your investment,
contact your investment adviser."

421
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,774
10 different levels of call girls.

422
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:16,442
For 10 different levels of investors.

423
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:18,077
The more you invest, the hotter the girl.

424
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,012
Frost, click the link
that says, "calendar."

425
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:22,782
It's got party
dates and street addresses.

426
00:24:22,816 --> 00:24:24,450
Look, two nights ago,
there was a secret sex party

427
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:26,552
at the vacant mansion
where we found Neal's ear.

428
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:29,422
- A "secret sex party"?
- What would you call it?

429
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:31,557
Entertainment.

430
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,561
Check some of the other parties.
See if they're at vacant homes.

431
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:40,067
They were. Good call, Jane.

432
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:42,636
Listing agent on all of
them was Georgette Wilkins.

433
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,903
I thought you ran her name.

434
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:45,672
I did. Nothing came up.

435
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:47,740
Maybe her name isn't
Georgette. Let's run her prints.

436
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:49,409
We don't have her prints.

437
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:51,044
Yes, we do. Georgette
gave me her business card.

438
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:56,883
Old-school has always wanted to try
new school's laser print scanner.

439
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:09,764
"Candy Smith."
Ooh, Georgette is a prostitute.

440
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:11,865
In fairness, she's a former prostitute.

441
00:25:12,868 --> 00:25:15,703
Georgette sold Neal his house.

442
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:17,872
Neal and Dale were
desperate for investors.

443
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:21,743
So Georgette supplies the girls
in the houses she couldn't sell.

444
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,978
Neal throws the parties,
the rich whales swim in.

445
00:25:24,012 --> 00:25:26,947
- Everybody's happy.
- So, why is Neal dead?

446
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:34,990
Thank you.

447
00:25:35,024 --> 00:25:39,629
- Dr. Martin. Please come in.
- I'm sorry to barge in yet again.

448
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,498
There really was no one
else that I could talk to.

449
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:46,736
Well, you can talk to me.
Please.

450
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:51,541
Why is it so much
easier to tell a stranger

451
00:25:51,575 --> 00:25:54,644
the most intimate details of your life?

452
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,180
Because a stranger doesn't judge.

453
00:25:57,214 --> 00:26:00,783
Hmm.

454
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:03,786
My daughter.

455
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:07,924
I fell like I barely know her.
She's just so angry.

456
00:26:09,594 --> 00:26:12,563
And she has the right.

457
00:26:12,597 --> 00:26:14,565
I took her to a place
that made her sick,

458
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,167
and I've made her live my life.

459
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:20,768
I don't have children, but I ...
I think I understand.

460
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:27,541
Well, no one makes you know you've
failed the way your child does.

461
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:32,611
I think all daughters feel
that way about their mothers.

462
00:26:32,646 --> 00:26:36,148
We fear that...
we won't measure up.

463
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:42,086
But it's a mother's job
to protect her child.

464
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,755
I've failed twice.

465
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:52,027
You said that you...
that your first baby died.

466
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:56,832
I mean, how ...
how can that be your fault?

467
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,567
And Cailin ... she's ...
she's a teenager.

468
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:02,536
You know, it's
her job to push you away.

469
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:07,640
It says that she's strong...
because of you.

470
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:09,908
Maybe.

471
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:19,716
Mass General called today.
They found a kidney donor for her.

472
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:25,120
It's an anonymous donor.

473
00:27:25,154 --> 00:27:26,688
A complete stranger.

474
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:34,761
Maura, I'm afraid I've
already lost my daughter.

475
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:38,932
- Not to this illness, but...
- You haven't.

476
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:42,902
I know you haven't.

477
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:48,607
You have been so very kind.

478
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,776
The kindest of strangers.

479
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:04,086
We know you lied about your
relationship with Neal Murray.

480
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:07,088
I'm so sorry, officer. I have no
idea what you're talking about.

481
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:08,589
I'm late for a lunch appointment.

482
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:10,224
Drop the act, Candy.

483
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:13,093
Yeah, I knew Neal.
That isn't a crime.

484
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:15,095
Obstruction of
a murder investigation is.

485
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,432
I don't know how he died
or what he was doing in that house.

486
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,924
Maybe he was at a party for big,
fat investor whales,

487
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,204
and maybe you supplied the
high-class call girls for it.

488
00:28:23,238 --> 00:28:26,308
- Maybe you were even there, Candy.
- Or maybe you don't have jack.

489
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:29,044
Excuse me.
I have a lunch appointment.

490
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:36,017
How does he know we're not members?

491
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:42,156
- Who you calling?
- The only member I know.

492
00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:47,094
All right, well, where is she?

493
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:49,497
She couldn't have eaten
that fast.

494
00:28:49,532 --> 00:28:53,134
Neal's latest tox panel came back
positive for potassium chloride.

495
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:54,502
Well, is that what stopped his heart?

496
00:28:54,537 --> 00:28:56,171
Well, that's what was
injected into his penis.

497
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:02,344
Maura. You're gonna get us
kicked out of this place.

498
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:04,478
Why? Because I said
"potassium chloride"?

499
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,346
What are you having for lunch?

500
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:10,483
- What are "baby jewels and gems"?
- Lettuce.

501
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:14,553
We don't call those
"solid, vertical room separators."

502
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,222
- You mean the walls?
- Exactly.

503
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:20,193
Let-tuce.
Pre-ten-tious.

504
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:23,864
Ooh.
She's going to the bathroom.

505
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:25,967
- I'm coming.
- What? No.

506
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:27,068
I have to pee.

507
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:30,005
- You better be telling the truth.
- All mammals have to pee.

508
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,907
We got all day.

509
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:34,843
We know about the parties,

510
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:37,044
the super-secret precious-metal
code for the girls.

511
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,312
I'm homicide, Georgette, not vice.

512
00:29:39,347 --> 00:29:41,448
Unless you killed Neal,
all I want to do is talk.

513
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,418
He was a nice guy.

514
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:48,888
Not much in the looks
department, but nice.

515
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:51,157
I didn't kill him.

516
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:55,828
Hi. It's safe to talk in front of me.
I'm working the case, too.

517
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:58,397
- Oh, are you?
- Yes, I am. I'm Dr. Maura ...

518
00:29:58,432 --> 00:30:01,067
Save it. Who cares? Let's get
to the chase? What do you want?

519
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:02,335
Who was with Neal the night he died?

520
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,270
I don't know. It was busy.

521
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:06,039
Well, I know you supply the
girls, so give me their names.

522
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:10,543
Uh, let's see.
Caress, Delight, Peaches.

523
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:12,312
- I don't suppose you do
any background checks?  - No.

524
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,881
Well, you should at least
check for venereal diseases.

525
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:16,049
What are you, the health department?

526
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,919
We use the same girls every time.
The clients sign a release.

527
00:30:18,953 --> 00:30:20,353
Informed consent. That's wise.

528
00:30:20,388 --> 00:30:23,056
Look, you're gonna provide
these same girls again,

529
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,260
because one of them injected Neal
with potassium chloride and killed him.

530
00:30:27,295 --> 00:30:28,963
And we're gonna find
her at tonight's party.

531
00:30:28,997 --> 00:30:30,531
And if I don't?

532
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:32,934
Well, then you can say
buh-bye to all your fancy clubs

533
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:34,571
and say hello to
Framingham state prison.

534
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:39,011
Before we do anything, may
I have one of your hairs,

535
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,946
with the root ball attached, please?

536
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:43,182
What? Ew.

537
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:51,290
The hair we found on the victim
does not belong to Georgette.

538
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:54,260
Okay, so we go forward with plan "A".

539
00:30:54,294 --> 00:30:56,629
Another undercover operation, Rizzoli?

540
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:59,299
Uh, we're just collecting hair samples.
Frost and Korsak will be there.

541
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,401
- I should be there, too.
- No, no, that's okay.

542
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:03,570
Uh, with, uh,
my comparison microscope.

543
00:31:03,604 --> 00:31:07,474
- No, I don't think so.
- Dr. Isles is right.

544
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:09,443
She can go look at all the
samples and log them in.

545
00:31:09,478 --> 00:31:13,313
- Preserve chain of custody.
- Okay, sure.

546
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:16,116
- Yes!
- What is your problem?

547
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:17,684
Oh. What are we going to wear?

548
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:20,120
I have never been a high-class
hooker before.

549
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,625
What?

550
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,139
I hate this outfit.

551
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:40,641
Stop complaining
about the outfits, already.

552
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:44,276
Why couldn't we dress up like
call girls? They look so cute.

553
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:47,547
They have to take their
outfits off, Maura.

554
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:49,382
Oh.

555
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,051
Let's find a place for your science kit.

556
00:31:52,085 --> 00:31:55,455
Oh. Check out
the legs on that one.

557
00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:57,190
That is the hottest part of a woman.

558
00:31:57,224 --> 00:32:03,597
But I also like that little
"S" curve along the hip.

559
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,465
You know, like, when they ...
when they ... when they ...

560
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,068
When they lean back
like that and you just...

561
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:09,470
You guys know we can hear you, right?

562
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:18,044
Sorry. My bad.

563
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,445
One down.
17 to go.

564
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,185
That's the coach from Campbell high.

565
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:26,586
<i> What the heck is he doing there?</i>

566
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,089
Hitting on Georgette, it looks like.

567
00:32:29,123 --> 00:32:31,024
His wife, Lori, is gorgeous.

568
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,659
Bill maher says, "show
me a beautiful woman,

569
00:32:32,694 --> 00:32:34,161
I'll show you a husband who's
sick of sleeping with her."

570
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:36,328
<i>How did he get the
money to hang out here?</i>

571
00:32:43,737 --> 00:32:49,175
- Wow. How you get in?
- What do you mean?

572
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,045
You're like, not even a ...
a Indium.

573
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,216
"An" Indium.
And, no, I am not.

574
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,619
So, what are you ...
like, Tin or something?

575
00:32:58,653 --> 00:33:00,220
We're, like, aluminum foil.

576
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:02,556
Don't get all upset about it.
It's not my fault.

577
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:06,428
Ow!

578
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:09,599
Everyone here is a perv.

579
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,807
This cuticle thickness is close.

580
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:20,209
Aw. But the pigment
granules don't match.

581
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:22,278
Okay, last ones.

582
00:33:22,313 --> 00:33:25,615
I'm gonna go track them
down in the leather room.

583
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:29,451
Leather certainly bears further study.
It's a historical fetish.

584
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:34,123
Think about it ...
corsets, dog collars ...

585
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:38,796
...whips, belts...

586
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:56,614
Is that Georgette?

587
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:59,351
Particles of type "N"
mortar from the pool coping

588
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:00,619
are embedded in the wound.

589
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:03,388
She hit the side
and lost consciousness in the pool.

590
00:34:03,422 --> 00:34:05,090
- So, she was pushed in?
- Yes.

591
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:09,261
I'm ruling it a homicide.
And take a look... at this.

592
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:14,700
- Cubic zirconia?
- Hardly. Four carats, light yellow.

593
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:18,570
It looks like "fl/if."

594
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:20,238
Oh, no, that's a blemish.

595
00:34:20,273 --> 00:34:21,707
What kind of hooker gets paid in carats?

596
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:25,443
- The girlfriend kind.
- Oh.

597
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:28,213
So, Georgette must
have hung up her mask?

598
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:31,349
Yeah. And no match on any of the
blond hairs from any of our call girls.

599
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:32,350
Thank you.

600
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:36,854
These are the results on the
jellylike substance on Neal's cloak.

601
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:40,658
- It's calcium acetate.
- Otherwise known as?

602
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:42,193
Canned butane gel.

603
00:34:42,227 --> 00:34:44,295
It's used in food
service to keep food warm.

604
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:45,763
The caterers.

605
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:48,199
That's why we couldn't match
the hair to a call girl.

606
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,867
It's got to be from a caterer waiter.

607
00:34:49,902 --> 00:34:54,372
- There's a print here.
- Could be the victim's.

608
00:34:54,406 --> 00:34:58,275
I think a second person tried this
ring on. It's a different print.

609
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:09,381
So, as financial chair, I want to assure you
your investments are healthy. 

610
00:35:09,415 --> 00:35:12,017
I recommend that we stay the
course with Murray & Bowman.

611
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:14,386
We recommend you get
a new financial chair.

612
00:35:14,454 --> 00:35:15,654
Excuse me?

613
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:17,790
You're under arrest for embezzling
your fellow teachers' pension money.

614
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:22,295
What?
What did you do, Doug?

615
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,864
Spent a bunch of money
on this diamond ring.

616
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:27,299
Mm. Lucky you, Mrs. Gatz.

617
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,936
Oh, wait.
That was for Georgette, wasn't it?

618
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,771
I don't know what you're talking about.

619
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:34,341
We found your prints on the ring.
We found Georgette's, too.

620
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:35,909
You tried it on before you killed her.

621
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:38,546
- Oh, god.
- We're thinking there was some pillow talk.

622
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,081
You told Lori about
Neal's heart condition,

623
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:42,083
his trouble getting it
up without an injection.

624
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:45,453
Handy that you're a nurse, Lori.
Pretty, too.

625
00:35:45,488 --> 00:35:48,023
You snuck in with the catering,
and then you injected potassium chloride

626
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:49,558
into the man who ruined your life.

627
00:35:49,593 --> 00:35:51,727
Did you know
Doug was having an affair?

628
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:53,662
Or did you figure it out
after you killed Neal?

629
00:35:53,696 --> 00:35:55,464
This is insane.

630
00:35:55,498 --> 00:35:57,967
Yeah, that's what we
thought when we saw you push

631
00:35:57,968 --> 00:36:00,436
Georgette into the pool
on this surveillance tape.

632
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,870
This is your fault.

633
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:05,474
<i>- We don't have a surveillance tape.
- She doesn't know that.</i>

634
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:07,343
You couldn't let go of
your high-school buddies.

635
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:10,614
We were happy.
But you let Neal drag you in,

636
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,349
show you this life you
thought you were missing.

637
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:14,885
You fell in love with a whore.

638
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:18,089
- Let's go, Lori.
- Hands behind your back.

639
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:28,966
Cailin. Hi.
Come in.

640
00:36:31,036 --> 00:36:35,606
Do you know at the name "Cailin" means?

641
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,910
- No.
- It means "uncertain."

642
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:41,413
That's the name that
my mother picked for me.

643
00:36:41,447 --> 00:36:45,883
- "Maura" means "great."
- Yes, I know.

644
00:36:45,918 --> 00:36:50,922
- That's the name she picked for you.
- Cailin, please let me explain.

645
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:52,590
Hmm.

646
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,825
Can you explain why you called
my mother out of the blue

647
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:57,760
with some bullshit story?

648
00:36:57,795 --> 00:37:00,163
This is very complicated.

649
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:02,599
She's trying to bond with
me now, since I'm dying.

650
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:05,802
You know, make up for all
those years she wasn't there.

651
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:07,137
You're not going to die.

652
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:11,141
"Don't ... don't do what I did, Cailin."

653
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:12,876
Right.

654
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:17,448
Like I'm gonna have time to...
fall in love...

655
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:22,586
get pregnant...
have a baby...

656
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:27,157
...hold that baby once
before she dies.

657
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,029
You, um...
you put it back up.

658
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:38,869
I went snooping.
I found it in the bathroom.

659
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:42,439
I mean, it is my mother, isn't it?

660
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:45,709
And that's ...
that's your gravestone...

661
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:50,213
which is weird because...
you look okay to me.

662
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:53,083
Please just let me explain.
I didn't mean for any of this to ...

663
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,685
Do you have any idea what it's like

664
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,521
to grow up in the
shadow of a dead baby?!

665
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:02,559
I was never enough!

666
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:06,829
You are more than enough.
She loves you.

667
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:08,964
I know you think
I should have told her ...

668
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:12,200
- I should have told the both of you, but I ...
- Yeah. Yeah.

669
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:16,905
- I want to help you.
- I don't want your help!

670
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:20,743
And I don't want your kidney, either.

671
00:38:23,046 --> 00:38:25,014
Yeah.

672
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:29,652
Yeah, I...
I thought that was you.

673
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:37,894
You just... you don't get
a match like that from a stranger.

674
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:39,895
Cailin, please, don't throw your life away

675
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,930
because of what you think of me.

676
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:49,038
I don't want any part of you
living in me.

677
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:54,178
Cailin!
What is going on?

678
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:57,582
- You followed me?
- Well, you took our car.

679
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:59,651
- So you called the police?
- Well...

680
00:39:01,554 --> 00:39:05,958
Hope... there's something
I need to tell you.

681
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:12,229
I'm Paddy Doyle's daughter.

682
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:16,967
What?

683
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:20,103
I'm your daughter.

684
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:25,209
I know that must be strange to hear.

685
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:26,577
Don't say that.

686
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:29,280
This is my daughter.

687
00:39:29,314 --> 00:39:32,016
Paddy told you that I died at birth.

688
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,286
I am not looking
to be your daughter.

689
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,288
I ...
I have a mother and a father.

690
00:39:37,322 --> 00:39:39,990
- I just wanted you to know...
- Just stop!

691
00:39:40,025 --> 00:39:41,625
I don't know who you
are or what you want,

692
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,628
but I've had just about
as much as I can bear.

693
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:50,101
Cailin. Honey.
Let's just go.

694
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:03,916
I don't know what to say.

695
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:13,926
Out of all the scenarios I thought of...
that wasn't one of them.

696
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:22,602
She's in denial.
She's in shock.

697
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,137
Imagine, how would you react

698
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,606
if a grown woman walked
up to you and said...

699
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,277
"How you doing?
I'm your... dead baby."

700
00:40:33,048 --> 00:40:34,615
And what about Cailin?

701
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:37,285
If she doesn't let me
help her, she'll die.

702
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:41,756
Maura, you can't force your kidney on her.

703
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,660
I wish I could.

704
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:52,334
I don't know. I never, ever
meant to cause them any pain.

705
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,369
It's just so awful.

706
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:58,407
Well, I tried to warn you.

707
00:40:58,442 --> 00:41:02,078
Family sucks.
Blow.

708
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:05,348
No.

709
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:09,786
No.
I'm all cried out. Okay?

710
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:12,790
I'm done.

711
00:41:12,824 --> 00:41:16,193
I'm done.
And, actually, I'm a little insulted.

712
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:21,432
- What'd I do?
- That girl rejected my kidney.

713
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:23,801
The nerve.

714
00:41:23,836 --> 00:41:28,006
I know.
Right? It's a very nice kidney.

715
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,742
I'm sure it is.

716
00:41:31,078 --> 00:41:34,013
You should keep it...
in your body.

717
00:41:35,282 --> 00:41:38,318
I'm just saying.

718
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:42,319
