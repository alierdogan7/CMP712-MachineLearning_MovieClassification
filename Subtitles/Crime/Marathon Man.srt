No, I think he was guilty.

187
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:46,198
He was guilty of being arrogant
and brilliant and of being naïve.

188

Of not being able to cope with
the humiliation of being dismissed.

I know he was innocent.

- Yes.

If so, you wouldn't be here with me.

517
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,395
- What else do you know?
- I know you're panicking.

518
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:06,232
- You think you'll get robbed.
- Who would do that?

519
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:08,568
- Obviously, you think I would.
- Well?

520
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,989
- Can I trust you?
- You never could. You only had to.

521
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:15,408
We're talking of my safety.

522
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,745
- May I be candid?
- Yes.

523
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,165

525
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,978
Hello? Hi, Elsa.

526
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,689
Are you all right? Did you get my note?

527
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:31,359
I've been trying you for two hours.
Finally, I just went running.

528
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,863
I'm sorry about your brother.

529
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,282
- It doesn't matter.
- It does!

530
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,368
I don't care. Forget it. It didn't happen.

531
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:43,538
I wanted to explain.
I lied about the Swiss, because...

00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,458
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

533
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:52,297
Take it easy, will you?
I can't understand.

534
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,633
Let me come over.

535
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:59,679
Okay? I'll take a shower, I'll be there?
Thanks. Okay, bye.

01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,538
- What? What?
- Babe...

540
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,833
I can't hear.

541
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:58,571
You look at me
like I'm doing something wrong,

542
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:01,574
like I did something wrong,
I don't understand it.

543
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,703
I don't know anything.

544
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:08,081
- DETECTIVE 1: Your name?
- BABE: I told you my name!

545
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,583
- DETECTIVE 1: Take it easy.
- Thomas Babington Levy.

546
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:11,668
DETECTIVE 1: You're a student.

547
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:15,421
I come from a family of historians.
My card is proof.

548
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:21,886
Please put the papers down.
Tell them. Put the papers down!

549
01:01:21,971 --> 01:01:24,430
DETECTIVE 1: Take it easy.
What's in the papers?

550
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,350
It's a paper I'm writing.

551
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,227
DETECTIVE 2: Would you
tell me who this is?

552
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:30,353
It's my father.

553
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,938
DETECTIVE 1:
Where can we contact him?

554
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,650
He's not alive any more.

555
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:40,196
- DETECTIVE 2: Is this yours?
- Yes. The license is in the drawer.

556
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:41,364
I don't know anything.

557
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:45,201
Why ask about this?
It has nothing to do with it.

558
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,121
DETECTIVE 1: Okay, enough.

559
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,916
- Here.
- Thanks.

560
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:57,380
DETECTIVE 1: I know this wasn't easy
and this is a bad time for you,

561
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:01,134
but it's gotta be done,
you can understand that, right?

562
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:05,513
Good evening, sir.

563
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:39,047
- Whoever did it must have set him up.
- Get them all out of here.

564
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,049
I'll get the ambulance guys.

(DOOR CLOSES)

566
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,684
I'm sorry to intrude.
I was a friend of your brother's.

567
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:56,522
My name is Peter Janeway.
Call me Janey. All my friends do.

568
01:02:56,774 --> 01:02:58,775
I'm not your friend.

569
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,819
Listen.

570
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:07,492
- I'm anxious as you to find who did this.
- I'm a little more anxious.

571
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:12,664
- I think it may have been political.
- Political? Why?

572
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:16,209
Considering what your brother did.
And your father, of course.

573
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:20,296
- What about my father?
- He was H.V. Levy, for Christ sakes.

574
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:23,174
He's been dead for 20 years,
and he was innocent.

575
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,968
What are you saying?

576
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:28,888
Get off my back!
They've been after me for two hours!

577
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:30,431
I didn't mean to imply...

578
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:33,559
They told me they were done!
What are you saying?

579
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:36,229
I'm sorry.

Listen...

583
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:28,031
Why don't we begin
with what happened tonight, hmm?

584
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:36,372
Perhaps you could
give me some of the details.

585
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:41,502
I was here. Doc died. You came.

586
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:44,213
That's it?

587
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,341
I'm a demon for details.

588
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:54,182
- You want me to explain, then?
- That's right.

589
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:56,392
- Where did your brother live?
- In Washington.

590
01:04:56,477 --> 01:04:59,604
- What did he do?
- Oil business.

591
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,898
Wrong.

592
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,525
I know exactly how Doc made his living.

593
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:08,988
The closest he got to the oil business
was when he filled up with gas.

594
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:13,117
- Tell me what you're talking about.
- All right. Follow me.

595
01:05:13,786 --> 01:05:16,954
Doc lived in Washington,
which is the centre of...

596
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,790
- Government.
- Correct.

597
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:21,125
All the branches are competitive.

598
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,045
Truth is they're all paranoid schmucks.

599
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,883
When the gap gets too large between
what the FBI can handle effectively

600
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:33,137
and what the CIA
doesn't wanna deal with, we step in.

601
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:35,848
- Who's we?
- The Division.

602
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:39,769
- And my brother worked with you?
- Yes.

01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,646
You're full of shit.

604
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:51,072
- What do you do exactly?
- We provide.

605
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:54,408
- Provide what?
- Anything.

606
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:58,454
And you two work together?

607
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:01,666
Why didn't Doc tell me?
Why did he lie to me?

608
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,503
He was afraid you'd be
disappointed in him, I expect.

609
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:10,716
We were very close for many years.
Believe me.

I know whereof I speak.

611
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:22,228
Doc was desperate to get here.
Remember anything he said?

612
01:06:22,855 --> 01:06:27,400
He said my name a couple of times.

613
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:32,613
Okay, I'm just guessing now,

614
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:36,909
but whoever killed him
will probably want to speak to you.

615
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:41,622
- I don't know anything.
- They won't know till they talk with you.

- No.

Yes, it's safe. It's very safe.

- No.

01:18:07,809 --> 01:18:10,018
He did experiments at Auschwitz.

678
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:15,107
He was called The White Angel,
Der Weiße Engel, due to his white hair.

The wealthiest and most wanted Nazi
left alive.

He's hiding out in Uruguay.

681
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:27,369
In '45, Szell told Jews in Auschwitz
he'd help them escape for a price.

682
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,956
He started out with gold, naturally,
but went on to diamonds.

Heard this?

684
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:34,251
Szell saw the end early.

685
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,461

the diamonds to America

to a safe deposit box in New York.

687
01:18:38,965 --> 01:18:40,132
Szell's brother had the key.

688
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,801
The only other key
Szell kept in Uruguay.

689
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:46,847
If he comes out to use it,
he'll expose himself to great risk.

690
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:50,851
Everything went fine till his brother
got killed by an oil truck.

691

Why was it natural to start with gold?

692
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,732
He took it from the Jews' teeth
before he burned them.

693

Szell was a dentist.

694

He's not coming to America,
Mr Janeway. He's here.

No. We'd have known it.

696
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,246
The dentist almost killed me.
He kept saying, "Is it safe?"

697
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:14,625
White hair? Keep your head down!
Did he have white hair?

698
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,293
He was bald.

699
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:20,005
He's shaved his head!
He's here, and he's panicked.

700
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:24,092
- Why is he after me?
- Your brother was a diamond courier.

701
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:27,387
Szell thinks Doc said something to you
before he died.

702
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:30,891
- Did he?
- You say my brother worked for Szell?

703
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:34,561
No! He worked for us.
Everything we do cuts both ways.

704
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,899
Szell ratted on all his buddies.
He kept track on all the Nazis.

705
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,485
When we wanted to bring one in,
we went to Szell.

706

just one thing.

- I'm not.

708

- He didn't.

709
01:19:50,787 --> 01:19:53,288
- He must have. Tell me!
- Nothing!

710

- Babe...

863

- I'm sorry...

864

What did you do for him?

865
01:38:05,297 --> 01:38:07,715
- Let me explain.
- Explain it.

866
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:09,925
- Explain my brother! Say it!
- Please. Stop it!

867
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:16,515
Stop it! Stop it!
Tell me when they're coming.

868

870
01:38:29,571 --> 01:38:31,072
Good.

871
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,408
Thanks.

872
01:38:46,088 --> 01:38:48,672
- When did you know?
- I didn't.

873
01:38:49,883 --> 01:38:51,175
Till now.

874
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:03,562

I can get you out of here.

882
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:03,789

- ELSA: I don't know.

883
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:10,129
What were you?

884
01:40:11,089 --> 01:40:13,048
Were you Szell's mistress?

885
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:18,971
- Tell me.
- No. I was a courier. Nothing more.

886
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:23,309
I took money from Paris into Uruguay,
that's all.

887
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,937
I never even met him.

888

890
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,013
Where is Szell?

891

- It's a lovely morning.

892
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:55,192
BABE: Hold it!

893
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:06,412
We're awaiting further instructions.
Do we take three giant steps or what?

894
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:09,039
Cops will be here soon.

895
01:42:12,377 --> 01:42:14,461
I don't think the police are coming.

896
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:19,216
Neither do I, but I could be wrong.

897

We can work out what you wanna
work out, but shouldn't we do it inside?

Okay. One at a time.

899

No! Over here. Over here.

01:42:50,749 --> 01:42:52,291
Sit. Sit!

901
01:42:53,251 --> 01:42:57,004
You should realise we're only
authorised to go to certain limits.

902

Cut the bullshit. Tell me where Szell is.

903
01:43:00,884 --> 01:43:03,093
Why did you let us get so close?

904
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:06,138
You're all in my killing range now.

905
01:43:06,222 --> 01:43:10,392
Taken target practice, have you?
A wizard at hitting paper?

906
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:14,855
It's not the same with flesh.
Smashing bone is different...

907
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:16,357

Hey.

...Szell is.

910
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:24,948
If the police were coming,
you wouldn't be so panicky.

911
01:43:25,033 --> 01:43:28,035
- BABE: They're coming.
- Somehow I don't believe that.

912
01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:31,580
Turn it on.

913
01:43:32,499 --> 01:43:34,625
Easy. Easy.

914
01:43:35,627 --> 01:43:39,046
We're all gonna take it easy.
Isn't that right, Erhard?

915
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:44,968
We're all just gonna sit here
and wait for the police, right, Karl?

916
01:43:48,223 --> 01:43:50,015
Where is he?

917
01:43:51,976 --> 01:43:56,980
Elsa, why don't you move away,
give the boy some room to breathe?

918
01:43:57,315 --> 01:43:58,857
No!

919
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:08,117
- Drop it! Get it down!
- All right, it's down!

920

I didn't want this to happen,
but I couldn't trust them.

921
01:44:10,912 --> 01:44:12,996
I'll give you Szell for your brother.

922
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:15,791
He's at a bank at 58th and Madison.

923
01:44:20,964 --> 01:44:22,089
Go.

924
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:24,299

- Anything we can show you today?

01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,583
Morning, sir.
Anything I could interest you in today?

929
01:45:40,668 --> 01:45:44,588
We heard that you were not there,
but I wouldn't say it was relevant.

930
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:49,259
I can't give you that much.
That much I don't make.

931
01:46:06,778 --> 01:46:09,196
DEALER: Okay.
Maybe we can make a trade.

932
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,866
No trade, I want cash for the ring.

933
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:17,079
If you want cash, I'll give you cash.
Let me take a look at it.

934
01:46:22,085 --> 01:46:25,629
I'd like to see a three-carat diamond.

935
01:46:25,755 --> 01:46:30,425
Why?
If you just wanna see, go window-shop.

936
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:33,720
- I was interested in...
- First there's gotta be trust.

937
01:46:33,805 --> 01:46:36,974
So I'll get this three-carat stone.

938
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:40,561
We'll take it to this
independent appraiser I know.

939
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:44,606
If he doesn't swear
I'm practically giving this stone away,

940
01:46:44,691 --> 01:46:47,818

a new brother-in-law.

941

I'm gonna do you a big favour.

942

- I'm no high-pressure artist. I sell value.

More probably.

947
01:47:25,023 --> 01:47:28,400
- Would that be prohibitive?
- Fifteen thousand.

948
01:47:29,235 --> 01:47:30,819
Fifteen...

949
01:47:31,696 --> 01:47:33,655

to our antique shop in London?

No, that wasn't it.

take a closer look than that?

1028
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:04,916
- No.
- You see...

1029
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:10,088
In a sense, one becomes
more emotional with age.

1030
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:14,843
First after a lifetime of being taken
by friends and enemies alike,

1031
01:56:14,927 --> 01:56:18,429
and then, just when you think
you have your possession sure,

1032
01:56:18,514 --> 01:56:21,099
your health begins to go.

1033
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:27,772
- That is, of course, the ultimate theft.
- That's close enough.

1034
01:56:27,857 --> 01:56:31,568
- In the circumstances, one's paranoia...
- Close enough!

1035
01:56:31,652 --> 01:56:33,862
- ...gets out of hand.
- Stop!

1036
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:43,830
Well?

1037
01:56:45,249 --> 01:56:47,750
What are you going to do now,
shoot me?

1038
01:56:49,128 --> 01:56:51,004
No, I don't think so.

1039
01:56:51,088 --> 01:56:55,175
Then you'll take these from me.
If I could say a word about that?

1040
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:58,136
No, you can keep them.

1041
01:57:01,807 --> 01:57:04,893
You can keep
as many as you can swallow.

1042
01:57:05,603 --> 01:57:08,188
Pardon me,
I'm not quite sure what you said.

1043
01:57:08,272 --> 01:57:09,606
Swallow?

1044
01:57:09,815 --> 01:57:11,441
Yeah, swallow.

1045
01:57:12,443 --> 01:57:13,693
Eat.

1046
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:16,446
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1047
01:57:18,949 --> 01:57:21,951
- You're joking.
- No, I don't think so.

1048
01:57:33,964 --> 01:57:35,215
I'm not joking.

1049
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,134
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1050
01:57:41,263 --> 01:57:42,263
(YELLS)

1051
01:57:42,723 --> 01:57:44,515
No, wait!

1052
01:57:45,809 --> 01:57:48,561
That man who was here
has seen your gun!

1053
01:57:48,646 --> 01:57:50,396
He'll bring others!

1054
01:57:52,650 --> 01:57:53,983
Swallow!

1055
01:57:55,611 --> 01:57:57,528
This is madness!

1056
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:11,584
Swallow.

1057
01:59:07,766 --> 01:59:09,225
Again.

1058
01:59:22,031 --> 01:59:23,156
No.

1059
01:59:24,533 --> 01:59:25,742
I won't.

1060
01:59:27,411 --> 01:59:29,245
You'll have to shoot me.

1061
01:59:32,541 --> 01:59:34,250
Come on.

1062
01:59:34,335 --> 01:59:35,626
Shoot.

1063
01:59:41,383 --> 01:59:42,759
You won't.

1064
01:59:45,471 --> 01:59:46,888
You can't.

1065
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:50,641
You're too weak.

1066
01:59:52,353 --> 01:59:57,357
Your father was weak in his way,
your brother in his, now you in yours.

1067
01:59:58,901 --> 02:00:02,945
You are all so predictable.

1068
02:00:26,095 --> 02:00:27,220
(YELLING)

1069
02:00:32,184 --> 02:00:33,935
Go get them!

1070
02:00:37,272 --> 02:00:38,481
(GRUNTING)

1071
02:00:45,155 --> 02:00:46,447
(GROANS)
