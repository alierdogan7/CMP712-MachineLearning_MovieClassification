This is like two grand to me.

- Let me see that.

25

The deal's for 5, 000.
That's about 2, 000. Count it yourself.

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,049
Uh, yeah, I'm looking
for Miss Jenny Summers.

332
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,811
She's very busy today.

333
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,371
Maybe you give me your name.

334
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,127
- My name's Axel Foley.
- And what it's pertaining?

335
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,890
I didn't understand what you said.

336
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,249
Pertaining...
What it's meaning... regarding?

337
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,085
Oh, what's it regarding?
I'm an old acquaintance of hers.

338
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,323
Donny. One moment.

339
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,527
Donny, run and tell Ms. Summers
that Mr. Achmed Foley to see her.

340
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,286
- No, Axel Foley. Axel.
- Achmel, Achwel?

341
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,805
Axel.

342
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,971
Foley's here to see her.
He's a old acquaintance.

343
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,771
- Donny, this is... Cover this up.
- I'm sorry.

344
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,844
Like a breast of a dog
to scrub for the customer.

345
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,606
- It's not sexy. It's animal.
- No, it's not sexy at all.

346
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,923
May I offer you something to drink?
Wine, a cocktail...

347
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,045
- Espresso?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

348
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,487
I make it myself back there
with the little lemon twist.

349
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,484
- It's good. You should try it.
- No, I'm... I'm fine.

350
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,685
I see you look at this piece.

351
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,081
Yeah, I was wondering how much
something like this went for.

352
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,844
One hundred and thirty thousand dollar.

353
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,122
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No! No, I cannot.

354
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,886
It's serious, because
it's very important piece.

355
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,646
- Have you ever sold one of these?
- Sell it yesterday to a collector.

356
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,844
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No, I'm serious! I sell it myself.

357
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,088
Axel Foley, what on earth
are you doing here?

358
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,287
How you doin'?

359
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,920
I'm fine! Hold a second,
I'll be right down.

360
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,128
Great, excuse me, Serge.

361
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,123
- What are you doing here?
- [Axel] How you doin'?

362
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,250
- Oh, God, it's good to see you.
- Same here.

363
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,090
- How have you been?
- I been... Look at you!

364
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,651
- You like?
- Yes!

365
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,131
- Is it good?
- You gettin' old.

366
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,970
- Fuck you.
- [both laugh]

367
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,645
- What is this?
- A moustache.

368
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,246
- Peach fuzz.
- No, that's man style now.

369
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,129
[laughing]

370
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,123
You have some place
where we can talk real quick?

371
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,442
Well, yeah. Right over there.

372
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,011
- Great.
- Come on.

373
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,481
- I can't believe how you filled out.
- Yeah, I filled out.

374
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,325
No, it looks good though.
Sit down.

375
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,010
I wanna talk to you about Mikey.

376
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,208
Oh, is he in trouble again?

377
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,645
He's dead.

378
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,286
What?

379
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,249
He's dead. He came to Detroit
and somebody killed him.

380
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,283
- I don't believe this.
- [phone ringing]

381
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,521
Look, I can't right now.
I'll be up in a second.

382
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,081
Mikey mentioned that you
helped him get a job.

383
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,284
Yeah...

384
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,043
The guy who owns this gallery
hired him as a favor to me.

385
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,045
Who's this guy?

386
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,851
His name is Victor Maitland.

387
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,603
He was working for Victor
at the gallery's warehouse.

388
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,121
Look, Axel, I can't talk right now,
I have to go upstairs.

389
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,890
That's cool.

390
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,207
I'll call you later on, and we'll
get together later and talk, OK?

391
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,691
Sure.

392
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,651
Be good.

393
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,083
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

394
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,722
- I have a delivery for Victor Maitland.
- I'll take it right upstairs to him.

395
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,769
Maybe I should give it to him myself.

396
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,127
Well, deliveries are
supposed to be left on my desk.

397
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,203
Yeah, but he has to get
these flowers, it's imperative.

398
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,600
I'm gonna go up myself, all right?

399
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,570
- You're not really supposed to go up.
- Floral delivery is my life.

400
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,449
I have to take it up. Thank you.

401
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,841
- Who let you in here?
- I let myself in.

402
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,331
How you doin'?

403
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,526
I have to ask you some questions
about Michael Tandino.

404
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,045
[Victor] Speak to you later, darling.

405
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,283
And what, may I ask,
is your interest in Mr. Tandino?

406
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,805
He was my best friend.

407
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,128
He came to see me in Detroit
a couple of days ago.

408
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,681
And a couple of hours after he
got there, someone killed him.

409
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,123
Oh, my God! That's terrible!

410
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,203
It's fucked up.

411
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,122
And? What do you wish to know?

412
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,725
He worked for you, didn't he?

413
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,407
Yes, yes, he did. Good gracious.

414
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,609
I'm really sorry to hear this.

415
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,889
Would you like to sit down?
Can I get you anything?

416
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,961
No, I'm all right.

417
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,329
Well, how on earth did this happen?

418
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,563
Detroit is a very violent city,
isn't it?

419
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,721
Yeah, it is.

420
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,687
Well, I do hope the police
have procured some intelligent leads.

421
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,331
Exactly what was it
Mikey did for you here?

422
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,841
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

423
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,681
My name is Foley.

424
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,686
Well, excuse me, Mr. Foley,
if I appear a little rude,

425
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,528
but this sounds like something
for the authorities in Detroit.

426
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,321
So, if you'll forgive me,
I really must get back to work.

427
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,891
Look, all I want to know is what kind...

428
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,850
Gentlemen, would you please
show Mr. Foley to the door?

429
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,365
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, take it easy.

430
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,205
Yo, man, get the fuck off me.
Get off me, man! Get off me!

431
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,204
- Get the fuck off me! Get off!
- [door slams]

432
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,760
- [elevator dings]
- [Axel] Get the fuck off me, man.

433
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:39,205
Get off me!

434
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,526
Get the fuck off me!

435
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,160
You think I'm playin' games, man? Hey!

436
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,481
I'm fuckin' somebody up.

437
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,766
Hey!

438
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,281
- What the fuck is this shit?
- [police siren approaching]

439
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,727
Did you see that shit?
I can describe all of them.

440
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,406
Please move to the side of the car
and put your hands on the hood.

441
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,686
Why, what's with you guys?

442
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,286
You heard what he said, sir.
Do it right now, please.

443
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,811
What kind of shit is this, man?
Hold up, wait a second.

444
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,402
You guys are arrestin' me for gettin'
thrown out of a fuckin' window?!

445
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,961
I got thrown out of a window, man!

446
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,327
Gun, partner!

447
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,041
Sir, you are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

448
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,010
Anything you say can, and will be
used against you in a court of law.

449
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,401
You have the right to have an attorney
present during questioning.

450
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,887
Yeah, I understand.
I understand the rights.

451
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,725
I know this is bullshit though.
I got thrown out of a fuckin' window!

452
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,531
- Please get in the car, sir.
- Tell me somethin', what's the charge?

453
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,445
Possession of a concealed weapon,
disturbing the peace.

454
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,285
Disturbing the peace?
I got thrown out of a window!

455
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,920
What's the fuckin' charge for gettin'
pushed out of a movin' car, huh?

456
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,287
Jaywalking'? This is bullshit!

457
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,926
You know, this is the cleanest
and nicest police car

458
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,208
I've ever been in in my life.

459
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,964
This thing's nicer than my apartment.

460
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,646
[Axel] Officers, if we see any like...
movie stars, could y'all stop

461
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,121
and point them out,
I never seen no shit like that.

462
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,965
- That's enough talkin', pal.
- OK, that's cool.

463
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,489
This is nice.

464
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,401
Well, it's about time.

465
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,722
Thought you forgot I was down here.
I was gettin' hungry.

466
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,848
I never been in no cell
that had a phone in it.

467
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,646
Can I stay for awhile,
'cause I ordered some pizza?

468
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,091
Somebody'd eat it.

469
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,926
[indistinct chatter]

470
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,009
Have a seat right over there, please.

471
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,522
I'm Sergeant Taggart and this is
my partner, Detective Rosewood.

472
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,205
You always treat visitors
from out of town like this?

473
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,881
Why didn't you identify yourself as a
police officer when you were arrested?

474
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,123
'Cause I was mindin' my own business.
Where the fuck do you guys get off

475
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,203
arrestin' somebody for gettin'
thrown out of a window?

476
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,647
We have six witnesses
that say you broke in

477
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,485
and started tearin' up the place,
then jumped out the window!

478
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,289
And you guys believed that? What
the fuck are you, cops or doormen?

479
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,927
We're more likely to believe
an important local businessman,

480
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,082
than a foul-mouthed jerk
from out of town!

481
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,601
Foul-mouthed? Fuck you, man.

482
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,570
- Hey, Sarg.
- You watch your mouth.

483
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,722
Don't square off on me
with some bullshit.

484
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,609
- You want to start some static?
- Don't push me!

485
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,728
- Fuck you, man.
- [grunts]

486
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,041
Ta

487
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,085
Yes, sir?

488
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,247
Come here.

489
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,090
[indistinct murmuring]

490
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,006
Sir...

491
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,088
I apologize for striking you.

492
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,331
I have no excuse.

493
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,125
Forget about it.

494
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,127
Detective Foley, I'm Lieutenant Bogomil,
of the Beverly Hills Police Department.

495
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,282
Do you wish to file charges
against Sergeant Taggart?

496
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,405
This is some kind of joke, right?

497
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,724
Do you wish to file charges
against this officer for assault?

498
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,487
Look, where I'm from, cops don't
file charges against other cops.

499
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,125
No, I don't wanna do that.

500
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,886
Well, in Beverly Hills,
we go strictly by the book.

501
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,170
Now, why didn't you inform us
when you came to town?

502
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,926
- I'm on vacation.
- Well, if you're on vacation,

503
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,560
what business did you have
in Victor Maitland's office?

504
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,846
I had to go to the bathroom.

505
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,287
I was walkin' by, it looked like
a nice clean place, so I stopped.

506
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,809
You always take your gun on vacation?

507
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,611
I don't know,
I never been on vacation before.

508
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,809
But in Detroit, cops are required
to carry a firearm at all times.

509
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,446
Well, if you wanna carry a gun,
I suggest you go back there.

510
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,206
I really can't wait to get back there,
if you wanna know the truth.

511
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,486
Is that so?

512
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,007
I just got off the phone
with an Inspector Todd in Detroit.

513
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,128
Does that name ring a bell?

514
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,841
He's my boss.

515
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,924
He tells me you might not
be very welcome back there.

516
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,689
He says that you're
an outstanding young detective.

517
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,366
I find that very difficult to believe.

518
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,726
But it's true, though.

519
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,531
He also says they nearly had
to fire you for insubordination.

520
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,411
I find that very easy to believe.

521
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,203
Now, what are you doing
in Beverly Hills?

522
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,681
I told you, I'm on vacation.
I went to the bathroom,

523
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,207
the next thing I knew six guys
threw me out a window.

524
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,523
Inspector Todd gave me
a message for you, wanna hear it?

525
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,601
I don't think so.

526
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,406
He says if you're out here
investigating the Tandino murder,

527
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,881
you needn't bother coming back.

528
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,964
He tells me that if we inform him
you are working on this case,

529
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,964
he'll have you brought up
on charges and fired.

530
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,247
Now, one last time,
what are you doing...

531
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,961
- I'm on vacation!
- Vacation! Vacation.

532
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,729
Rosewood, take Mr. Foley over to the
courthouse and let him arrange for bail.

533
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,290
Would you follow me, sir?

534
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,005
You know, I gotta hand it to you guys,
if anything you are extremely polite.

535
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,882
Pretty good punch
you got there, Taggart.

536
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,851
[Axel] After you.

537
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,765
After you.

538
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,122
You guys are so sweet, you know that?

539
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,206
Thanks for bailin' me out, Jen.

540
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,409
If I'd known why you'd been arrested,
I wouldn't have come.

541
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,762
[chuckling] Oh, you don't mean that.

542
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,210
No, I don't mean that.

543
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,049
Axel, if it wasn't for Victor Maitland,
I'd be waiting on tables!

544
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,282
It just so happens
that the day Mikey got killed,

545
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,410
he showed up at my apartment
with a bag of German bearer bonds.

546
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,722
I think he stole 'em
from whoever had him killed.

547
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,166
When I mentioned Mikey's name,

548
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,924
Maitland went nuts
and had me thrown out.

549
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,645
Axel, you look like a hoodlum.

550
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,485
You go barging into his office
without an appointment.

551
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,766
You're carrying a gun.

552
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,123
If you barged into my office and
I didn't know you, I'd throw you out.

553
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,611
Is this your car?

554
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,963
Oh, no, in Beverly Hills we just
take whichever car's closest.

555
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,284
I remember you used to drive
that crappy, blue Chevy Nova.

556
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,125
What are you driving now?

557
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,883
- The same crappy, blue Chevy Nova.
- [laughing]

558
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,485
You think it's too late
for me to study art?

559
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,880
Yeah, I do.

560
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,843
Axel, why were you bothering Victor?

561
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,321
You don't think he has anything to do
with Mikey getting killed?

562
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,849
Oh, no. No, I was just pokin' around
I don't think he did nothin'.

563
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,447
Axel, Victor Maitland
is one of the top art dealers

564
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,410
in the United States.
He has been for ten years.

565
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,130
I'm impressed.

566
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,005
- What are you looking back there for?
- The cops, they're following us.

567
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,731
What? Where?

568
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,008
In the back on the right.
The beige Ford.

569
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,045
Can you believe this place?

570
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,446
Axel, how can you afford this?

571
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,728
They're only charging me
the single room rate.

572
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,041
How can you afford that?

573
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,170
Actually I can't afford it. But you know
what they got inside that bathroom?

574
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,244
They got little robes,
with little initials of the hotel on it.

575
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,562
I love this place,
I can't leave this shit.

576
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,051
I'm gonna steal one of them robes.

577
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,440
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

578
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,761
- You want slippers?
- No.

579
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,400
I'm gonna steal them, too.
You should take some of this shit.

580
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,164
Excuse me two seconds.

581
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,725
Hello, room service?

582
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,885
Yes, this is Mr. Axel Foley
in suite 1035. Yeah.

583
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,401
I'd like to order something
from your late supper menu.

584
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,769
But listen, I want you to deliver it to
this beige Ford parked out on Wilshire.

585
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,045
Send down one
bay shrimp salad sandwich, OK?

586
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,881
Right, and is the cold poached
salmon in dill sauce tasty?

587
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,008
OK, send one of those down, all right?

588
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,606
And send down something for dessert.
Thank you very much.

589
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,250
All right, thank you.

590
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,051
You're quite a sport.

591
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,884
How long are you gonna stay?

592
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,486
I'm gonna be in town
until I find out who killed Mikey.

593
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,890
And I'm very seriously considering
going down to that warehouse

594
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,929
where he worked
and checkin' that place out.

595
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,448
Oh, really?
And how are you planning on getting in?

596
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,523
[both chuckling]

597
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,007
- Good evening, sir.
- What the hell is that?

598
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,640
It's late supper, sir,
compliments of Axel Foley.

599
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,282
Foley? How did he know we were here?

600
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,970
'Cause I let you drive.

601
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,929
I need a couple bananas,
how much are they?

602
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,321
Well, the buffet plate is $12.50.

603
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,802
You get peaches, plums,
oranges and bananas.

604
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,769
All I need is a couple of bananas.

605
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,446
Shh. Go ahead, take those bananas.

606
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,361
Thanks.

607
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,084
Forget it, I'm not eatin' that.
Take it back.

608
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,561
- [man] Certainly, sir.
- This really looks great.

609
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,444
Can I get some extra mayo?

610
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,931
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.

611
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,805
- [Axel] Ready to go?
' [Jenny] Yeah.

612
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,681
There's the Mercedes.
Will you get rid of that stuff?

613
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,406
[car sputters, stalls]

614
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,971
[Taggart] What the hell are you doing?

615
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,884
[engine turning over]

616
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,400
This the place?

617
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,609
Yeah, but I'm still not sure
I should do this.

618
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,046
OK, you don't have to do anything.

619
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,043
But when you hear glass
and shit breaking,

620
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,608
don't get scared, it's just me
kickin' in the window. Sit tight.

621
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,000
[Jenny laughing]

622
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,362
All right, come on, Axel.

623
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,806
What's happenin', baby?

624
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,724
[laughing] Axel, grow up.

625
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,961
[sniffs]

626
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,322
- You find something?
- Coffee grounds.

627
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,601
$0'?

628
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,643
You know what this stuff is used for?

629
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,451
Yes, some people filter hot water
through it and drink it.

630
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,438
Yeah, I'm gonna take this home
and filter hot water through it

631
00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:13,680
and drink it in the mornin'.

632
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,803
- [laughs]
- [mimics laugh]

633
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,849
[both laughing]

634
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,404
- [whispers] What are we hiding for?
- Shh.

635
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,601
I tell you, I wish you'd been
with me last night.

636
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,881
[man] What happened?

637
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,884
[man 2] I stopped at a joint on the way
home to have a couple of drinks.

638
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,884
- [man] Yeah. Which one?
- [man 2] One of the local joints.

639
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,641
This guy comes in, he sits down
a couple of stools away.

640
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,771
He's got one of them eyes
that's goin' like this.

641
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,123
I didn't know if he was tryin'
to put the make on me, or what.

642
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,044
So I thought I'd take you
over there tonight.

643
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,204
Let him have a little shot at you
before I tore his head off.

644
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,087
[sighs] Come on, let's go,
I wanna get outta here.

645
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,683
Why don't you get off my back.

646
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,921
Come on.

647
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,406
I got it.

648
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,880
- Axel, what the hell's going on?
- I'll tell you later, come on.

649
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,124
- Hurry up
- "Hurry up

650
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,090
- Gimme the key, I'm gonna follow 'em.
- You ever driven a Mercedes before?

651
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,561
No, but a car is a car.
I drive my car everyday.

652
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,529
I'm driving, I've seen your car.

653
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,842
Oh, shit, that's cold.

654
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,689
[car starts]

655
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,843
[brakes squeal]

656
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,890
A banana in your tailpipe!

657
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,884
How could you not notice a man
sticking a banana in your tailpipe?

658
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,122
- He distracted us, sir.
- And how'd he do that?

659
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,887
He sent us a late supper, sir.
See, this waiter comes over...

660
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,082
Billy, he gets the point.

661
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,129
A late supper.

662
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,684
And what did you have, Rosewood?

663
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,563
I think it was a shrimp
salad sandwich, sir.

664
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,764
- A shrimp salad sandwich.
- Yes, sir.

665
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,487
I want you two to go back to the hotel
and wait for Foley to show up.

666
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,926
And if you lose him again,
don't bother calling in. You got that?

667
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,447
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

668
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,609
"A late supper."

669
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,529
We've got something for you, Billy.

670
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,288
An anti-banana disguise.

671
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,571
It may come in handy.

672
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,927
A little extra protection, Billy.

673
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,411
[chuckling]

674
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,085
Very funny.

675
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,771
[sighs] Come on, Billy, let's go.

676
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,327
Why don't you take the car
and go on home?

677
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,487
- Well, what about you?
- I wanna find out what this place is.

678
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,291
[Jenny] Oh, I can tell you that.
It's a bonded warehouse.

679
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,489
They hold our foreign shipments here
until they clear Customs.

680
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,246
Well, I'm gonna go check it out.
Just take the car and go home, OK?

681
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,325
Damn it, Axel!
I'm not gonna bail you out again.

682
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,641
Go home.

683
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,883
How you doin'? Could you come here
for a second, please?

684
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,325
- Hi, do you have a match?
- There's no smoking in here.

685
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,403
I'm not gonna smoke now,
I'm gonna smoke when I go outside.

686
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,244
Thank you very much. Thank you.

687
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,801
- Is your supervisor here?
- Yeah, he's in the office.

688
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,849
- Can you get him for me?
- What's the problem?

689
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,087
- You security here?
- Yeah.

690
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,608
Then you're the fuokin' problem,
go get your supervisor, please. Now!

691
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,528
- Now!
- OK.

692
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,365
He didn't come back yet.

693
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,284
[sighs]

694
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,530
Well, what do we do now?

695
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,920
We wait.

696
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,567
OK.

697
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,326
- Can I help you'?
- Are you the supervisor here?

698
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,447
Yes, who are you?

699
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,921
I'm Inspector Rafferty,
United States Customs Service.

700
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,287
Has all this stuff
passed through Customs already?

701
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,601
No, this is the bonded area.

702
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,524
Then tell me something.
Answer a question.

703
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,763
How can a black man, dressed like me,
just march into your warehouse,

704
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,610
walk into the bonded area
and start poking around

705
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,127
without anyone askin' me
any questions whatsoever?

706
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,531
Well, I don't know.

707
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,409
Thank you, that's the answer
I was lookin' for.

708
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,450
Just give me your ID numbers,
'cause somebody's gonna lose their job.

709
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,728
This guy gave me a match,
for Christ's sake.

710
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,120
You gave him a match?

711
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,966
Listen to me. I do security checks
all over the nation,

712
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,849
and with the exception of Cleveland,

713
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,288
this place has the worst security
in the nation!

714
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,211
I suggest you call your wives,
'cause we're gonna be here all night.

715
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,847
We're gonna check the background
of each and every crate in this section,

716
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,843
starting with this one, right here!

717
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,323
Wow.

718
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,008
You know, it says here that by the
time the average American is 50,

719
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,131
he's got five pounds
of undigested red meat in his bowels.

720
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,610
Why are you telling me this?

721
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,604
What makes you think
I have any interest in that at all?

722
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,242
Well, you eat a lot of red meat.

723
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,243
Now, the inspector needs
all the information

724
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,846
- on those airway bill numbers.
- All the manifests, too.

725
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,048
That's right, and he needs
the records of all shipments

726
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,690
- due into the same destination.
- Right.

727
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,968
- What's this all about?
- Just do it!

728
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,122
You got some kind of warrant for this?

729
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,722
You know, you have a very big mouth.
Are you hiding something from me?

730
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,249
I bet that's your Porsche that's parked
outside. Isn't that your Porsche?

731
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,323
How would you like for me
to have the IRS come down here

732
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,767
and crawl up your fuckin' ass with
a microscope? 'Cause they'll do it!

733
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,843
I've seen 'em do it!
It's not a pretty sight!

734
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,566
I want you to know somethin', pal.
I want all y'all to know somethin'.

735
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,530
I can have 25 agents down here
in 15 minutes,

736
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,251
to march in here,
snatch up bonds from underneath you

737
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,289
and you guys'll be
out of business permanently

738
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,442
if I don't get some cooperation!
Is that understood?

739
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,723
Don't get upset, we'll give
you everything you need. Right, guys?

740
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,087
- Everything you need.
- That's not my Porsche.

741
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,641
- I don't know whose it is.
- You ain't got nothin' to worry about.

742
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,406
I don't know what you all think I am,
take me for some kind of fool.

743
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,447
Hurry up! Quicker!

744
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,050
You know, I noticed you've been
drinking a lot of coffee lately.

745
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,611
Well, I think that's why you
have a hard time relaxing.

746
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,645
[car door shuts]

747
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,365
Ha-ha-haa!

748
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,130
Jesus Christ!

749
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,523
You almost gave me a heart attack.

750
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,205
What are you guys doin' here so late?

751
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,607
You're a cocky son of a bitch,
aren't you?

752
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,843
Look, if you're still mad about
the banana thing, I'm sorry.

753
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,764
- Just needed a little time to myself.
- Yeah.

754
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,720
Just wish I would've saw the expression
on your face when the car konked out.

755
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,690
Yeah, very funny.
Lieutenant docked us two days' pay.

756
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,047
Get outta here!

- He's not kidding.
- No, he's not kidding.

758
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,805
By the way, thanks for the sandwich.

759
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,442
He meant it as a joke, Billy,
like the bananas.

760
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,567
[Axel] Hey, wait a minute.

761
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,445
I'm a fellow police officer, I know
what it's like to be on a stakeout.

762
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,802
When I sent that food down,
that was from the heart.

763
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,041
Bullshit!

764
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,089
Why are we always arguing, man?

765
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,447
All three of us are cops,
we should be workin' together.

766
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,762
We all had a very rough day today.

767
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,605
What do you say,
we all go get something to drink

768
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,603
and make up and be friends, huh?

769
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,805
Forget it.

770
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,571
OK, fuck it. I'm gonna
get somethin' to drink, all right?

771
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,882
You guys can try to follow me
if you want to do that,

772
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,811
but I lost y'all once today,
which means I can do this shit again.

773
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,923
Why don't we just go get
somethin' to drink together?

774
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,084
- Let's be friends.
- We don't drink on duty.

775
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,289
OK, fine, all right, but listen to me.

776
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,841
I found the perfect place.

777
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,082
I saw it on the way over here.
It's perfect for you guys.

778
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,766
You can go, it's very conservative
and you guys'll love it.

779
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,526
Don't worry, it's nice. Trust me.

Yes! I'm havin' a great time.
Can I have a Scotch and soda?

You don't have to be embarrassed
if your dick gets hard.

It's a dick, it's supposed to get hard.
That's the whole object of this.

Taggart's dick gets hard, but he won't
let you know, 'cause he's the boss.

790
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,243
Boss's dick got to stay limp, right?

791
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,767
I ain't on duty, so my dick can be hard.

over there in the black coat?

00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,283
- Get outta here, man.
- I told you it's Philip, you liar!

825
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,885
Hey, Philip, gimme kiss, baby!

826
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,929
- I said get the hell out of here!
- Hew

827
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,730
[music stops abruptly]

828
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,166
Everybody, freeze!

829
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,882
Turn around. Turn around!

830
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,929
- Phil!
- [man] Get your hands on the table!

831
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,880
Phil! What's wrong, man?
What's all the hostility?

832
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,441
- Get back, man.
- What you doin' with all this gun, man?

833
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,409
- I told you to get back.
- You changed, man!

834
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,609
If you don't get back,
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains out!

835
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,085
Police, move and I'll kill you.

836
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,042
Don't move! Turn over!

837
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,003
Way to go, Rosewood.
You're some kind of cop, you know that?

838
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,243
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything's under control.

839
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,449
[cheering, applause]

840
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,601
Taggert!

841
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,602
Would you mind explaining to me
what you and Rosewood

842
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,604
were doing in a strip bar
out of our jurisdiction,

843
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,250
when you were still on duty?

844
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,448
Sir, before you chastise
these two officers,

845
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,250
I think there's something
you should know.

846
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,131
The only reason that they
were at a strip bar

847
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,726
was because they were tailing me
and I went to this place.

848
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,810
Now, these two officers were sitting
outside wondering what I was doing.

849
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,725
I was in havin' a good time,
I'm into things like that.

850
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,486
Anyway, these guys waited outside,

851
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,444
and the only reason
that they came in

852
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,802
was because they saw
two suspicious-looking gentlemen,

853
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,486
with bulges in their jackets,
going into the place.

854
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,885
Well, it turns out that these guys were
gonna commit a robbery, sir.

855
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,611
These men watched them,
waited for them to make their move

856
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,444
and then they foiled the crime.

857
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,888
I did not know what was goin' on.
I was watchin' the show, havin' fun.

858
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,566
I'm still freaked out by it.
They must have a sixth sense or...

859
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,442
I don't know what you teach these
fellows, but they're not regular cops.

860
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,681
They're super cops.

861
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,764
And the only thing missing
on these guys are capes.

862
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,644
Is this what really happened?

863
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,685
No, sir.

864
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,003
Would someone like to tell me
what really happened?

865
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,401
[clears throat] Well...

866
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,006
Foley invited us to this bar...
and we accepted.

867
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,367
We ordered club soda, sir.

868
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,127
Right. And while we were there...

869
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,130
Foley observed the two suspects
casing the establishment.

870
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,760
And before we knew
what was going on...

871
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,007
...he'd already disarmed one of them.

872
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,088
Detective Foley deserves
all the credit for the arrest, sir.

873
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,211
Detective Foley,
we appreciate your assistance.

874
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,446
But in the future, if you want
to practice law enforcement,

875
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,211
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.

876
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,165
I understand, sir. I'm sorry.

877
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,403
But before I go I just want you
two to know something, all right?

878
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,609
The super cop story was working.

879
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,007
OK? It was working
and you guys messed it up.

880
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,722
OK? I'm tryin' to figure
you guys out, but I haven't yet.

881
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,245
But it's cool.

882
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,165
You fuck up a perfectly
good lie and it's all right.

883
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,923
You guys are off the case.

884
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,846
Foster. McCabe. Your turn.

885
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,241
Don't lose him.

886
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,970
Not a chance, sir.

887
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,446
And you two... in my office.

888
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,722
[mouthing] Well? Go on.

889
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,600
Morning, gentlemen.
Some coffee and donuts?

890
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,681
- What?
- Coffee and donuts.

891
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,724
[raps on window]

892
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,120
There he is.

893
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,565
[car door shuts]

894
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,964
Morning, officers.
What you all, the second team?

895
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,566
We're the first team.

896
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,803
Yeah. We're not gonna fall
for a banana in the tailpipe.

897
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,850
[mocking] "You're not going to fall
for the banana in the tailpipe?"

898
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,566
It should be more natural, brother,
it should flow out, like this:

899
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,485
[forcefully] "Look man, I ain't fallin'
for no banana in my tailpipe!"

900
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,244
See, that's more natural for us.

901
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,004
You been hangin' out
with this dude too long.

902
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,367
[chuckling]

903
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,922
I'm sorry, I'm just fuckin' with you.
That's funny to me. Sorry.

904
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,128
So, y'all gonna try and keep up with me?

905
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,682
- No problem.
- Isn't this Victor Maitland's house?

906
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,524
Yeah, I think so.

907
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,529
[sighs]

908
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,170
Well, I seen enough.

909
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,010
Y'all want somethin' to drink?
A beer or somethin'?

910
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,686
I got some stuff in the trunk.
Excuse me.

911
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,330
For a man who claims to be on vacation,

912
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,050
you look a lot like
you're on a stakeout.

913
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,569
Stakeout? No, no, I'm picnicking.
This is like a picnic area.

914
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,041
Well, guys, I been
shootin' the shit long enough.

915
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,885
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.

916
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,729
[tires screeching]

917
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,250
What the hell's he doing?

918
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,604
[tires squealing]

919
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,927
[laughing]

920
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,924
Can you put this in a good spot?

921
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,163
All this shit happened the last time
I parked here. Thank you.

922
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,486
May I help you?

923
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,405
[effeminate] Yes, I'm looking
for Victor Maitland.

924
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,207
You realize that this is
a members-only club?

925
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,045
Mm-hm, but I have to talk to Victor,
it's very, very important.

926
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,328
Are you sure it's
Victor Maitland you want?

927
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:20,082
Oh, yes, the grey haired gentleman,
very dark skin, Capricorn. Victor.

928
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,521
Well, why don't you give me
the message and I'll take it to him.

929
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,409
OK, I guess I can do that.

930
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,689
Tell Victor that Ramon,
the fella he met about a week ago,

931
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,491
tell him that Ramon
went to the clinic today

932
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,564
and I found out that I have...

933
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,084
...Herpes symplex ten.

934
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,642
And I think Victor should go check
himself out with his physician

935
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,883
to make sure everything is fine, before
things start fallin' off on the man.

936
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,761
Perhaps you better tell him that.

937
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,326
You know, I think that would be best.

938
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,084
So do I.

939
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,605
Hi, Victor.

940
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,284
I'm back.

941
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,963
Look, cuz, don't even try it, OK?

942
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,806
Why don't you get the hell
outta here, cuz.

943
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,008
Get the fuck away from me.

944
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,405
[mouths]

945
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,891
That's very good, Victor.

946
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,964
Could you teach him to roll over
and sit and do all that shit, too?

947
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,561
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you.

948
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,643
Last time we met,
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

949
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,001
- I have nothing to say to you.
- That's cool, I'll do all the talking.

950
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,611
This is a very nice place, Vic.

951
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,604
Hi. I like this, this is nice.

952
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,802
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.

953
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:21,125
You know, Victor, I know that you're
into a lot of crooked shit.

954
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,568
And I have a pretty good idea
that you had Mikey killed.

955
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,130
And when I find out for sure...

956
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,362
...I'm gonna fuck you up real bad.

957
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,521
Is that so?

958
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,889
Now, listen to me,
my tough little friend.

959
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,884
I don't know from under
what stone you crawled,

960
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,401
or where you get these
ridiculous ideas about me,

961
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,009
but it seems painfully obvious

962
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,006
you haven't the slightest fucking
idea who you're dealing with.

963
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,363
Now, my advice to you is...

964
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,364
...crawl back to your
little stone in Detroit,

965
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,366
before you get squashed, OK?

966
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,528
Please step away from the table, sir.

967
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,205
Gotta go now, Vic.

968
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,761
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.

969
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,928
[handcuffs clicking]

970
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,528
Catch you later, Vic.

971
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,762
I can't wait.

972
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,129
Don't I know you guys from some place?
You look so familiar.

973
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,082
Detective Foley,
this is becoming very irritating.

974
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,322
Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?

975
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,446
I had a friend named Michael Tandino
that used to work for Victor Maitland.

976
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,604
And Maitland had him killed.
I can't prove that right now,

977
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,842
but when I do,
you'll be the first to know.

978
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,890
Forget what you can prove.
Talk to me.

979
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,444
OK, listen, everybody knows
that Victor Maitland

980
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,125
is a hot-shot art dealer, OK?

981
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,409
But I did some pokin' around and
art's not the only thing that he deals.

982
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,404
I went to his warehouse
and I saw some guys unloading a crate

983
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,767
that was filled
with German bearer bonds.

984
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,163
Now, my friend Michael Tandino
had bonds like this on him,

985
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,800
coincidentally,
when he was killed in Detroit.

986
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,961
Just because Maitland chooses

987
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,122
to invest in the same kind of bonds
your friend had,

988
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,884
doesn't necessarily mean he's a killer.

989
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,850
The man's not an investor,
he's a smuggler, OK?

990
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,571
Be it bonds or drugs or whatever.

991
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,326
The crate that I saw
didn't even pass through Customs.

992
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,130
Maitland is paying someone so his guys

993
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,971
can get the shipments out of Customs
before they get inspected.

994
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,969
Maitland's guys get their hands on it,

995
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,322
they take the drugs
or the bonds out of the crates

996
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,563
and they send it back before
Customs even knows what's going on.

997
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,930
And you witnessed all this?

998
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,367
Everything except for the drugs,

999
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,887
but I found coffee grounds
all over the warehouse.

1000
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,006
Coffee grounds?

1001
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,128
You said something about that before.
What does that mean?

1002
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,601
Drugs are sometimes
packed in coffee grounds.

1003
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,000
The scent throws off the dogs.

1004
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,322
Very good, lieutenant.
Now what do we do?

1005
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,529
Look, Detective Foley, I...

1006
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,683
I'm sorry.

1007
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,365
I'd really like to help you.

1008
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,681
If you'd found the drugs,
that's one thing,

1009
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,207
but if your only evidence
is coffee grounds,

1010
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,964
we don't have enough
to get a search warrant.

1011
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,844
Come on, guys,
I know how we can get around...

1012
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,646
We don't get around search warrants
in Beverly Hills.

1013
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,489
- Taggart.
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,290
I want you to start checking this out.

1015
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,047
Start with the LAPD, the FBI
and the Customs Service.

1016
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,565
Hey, wait a minute, Taggart.

1017
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,081
Look, lieutenant,
Maitland is much smarter than that.

1018
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,890
We go and start
snoopin' around his place,

1019
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,122
he's gonna close down and get
his shipments from someplace else.

1020
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,567
- It'd be a big waste of time.
- Oh, really?

1021
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,371
Is that what your extensive experience
leads you to believe?

1022
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,767
- Look, I haven't been on your force...
- Sir!

1023
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,201
Oh, shit.

1024
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,444
- Is this the man?
- Yes, sir.

1025
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,125
Is this the gentleman who crashed
through Victor Maitland's window?

1026
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:11,121
Who disabled an unmarked unit
with a banana?

1027
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,486
Yes, sir.

1028
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,008
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont

1029
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,562
into a gross dereliction of duty

1030
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,530
at a striptease establishment?

1031
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,245
It's Rosewood, sir.

1032
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,480
Yes, sir.

1033
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:32,042
Is this the gentleman who ruined the
buffet at the Harrow Club this morning?

1034
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,769
[Bogomil] Yes, sir.

1035
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,721
I just bet you are the pride
of your department in Detroit.

1036
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,929
Lieutenant, I'd like to see you
in your office.

1037
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,285
Yes, sir.

1038
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,964
[mocking] ls this the man who...

1039
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,251
...wrecked the buffet
at the Harrow Club this morning?

1040
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,243
[Taggart] Lower your voice,
for Christ's sake.

1041
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,562
Why, can the guy hear me
through the wall?

1042
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,046
[all] Yes, he can.

1043
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,925
Rosewood, take Detective Foley
back to his hotel room,

1044
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,801
watch him pack,
and escort him to the city limits.

1045
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,527
When you get there,
you can give him his gun back.

1046
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,323
The two charges of disturbing the peace
have been dropped against you.

1047
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,324
But the chief says if you return
to the city of Beverly Hills,

1048
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,881
the charges will be reinstated

1049
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,520
and you will be prosecuted
to the limit of the law.

1050
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,685
Sir, may I say something?

1051
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,080
- [Taggart] Billy...
- What?

1052
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,163
Well, he seems to have enough
to follow up...

1053
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,004
You wanna tell that to the chief?

1054
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,404
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.

1055
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,681
Come on, Axel.

1056
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,364
Right. Let me check on that
tomorrow and get right back to you.

1057
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,851
Thank you.

1058
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,800
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.

1059
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,088
Sit down.
Hope I'm not interrupting you.

1060
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,565
Of course not, don't be silly.

1061
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,806
Jenny, there's a gentleman
in town from Detroit

1062
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,930
who says he's a friend
of Michael Tandino.

1063
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,601
He came by the office yesterday
and asked me all sorts of...

1064
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,286
...rather odd questions.
Excuse me, darling.

1065
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,886
I believe his name is Foley.

1066
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,408
Since you were such a good friend of
Michael, I was wondering if you were...

1067
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,642
...perhaps familiar with the fellow?

1068
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,644
Well, we... grew up
in the same neighborhood.

1069
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,609
Really? Have you seen him lately?

1070
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,006
He... he came in yesterday.

1071
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,242
What, came by here?

1072
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,606
Huh.

1073
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,961
And?

1074
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,850
He told me that... Mikey'd been killed.

1075
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,091
Yes. Yes, I know.

1076
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,449
- And then?
- That's it.

1077
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,400
He left and...
I haven't seen him since.

1078
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,569
You wouldn't, by any chance, know
where Foley's staying would you?

1079
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,327
I have some information
which just might be helpful for him.

1080
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,483
No, I have no idea.

1081
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,690
[sighing] Yes

1082
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,801
Yes.

1083
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,360
Yes.

1084
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,282
Well, I hope I didn't
disturb you too much.

1085
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,568
Oh, no, no problem.

1086
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,803
- We'll have dinner soon, yes?
- That would be lovely.

1087
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,121
Take care.

1088
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,090
Hey, Billy,
I read the manifest, all right?

1089
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,607
They're expecting
another shipment in today.

1090
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,649
- If Bogomil...
- Never mind Bogomil!

1091
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,485
This is a chance to blow this case wide
open, the two of us, what do you say?

1092
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,005
- Come on.
- Look, Axel...

1093
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,322
I wish I could, but I can't!

1094
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,087
- Why?
- Because Bogomil would kill me.

1095
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,166
Billy...

1096
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,926
I'm not going to drive you
to the art gallery, Axel.

1097
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,530
It'll just take a couple of minutes!

1098
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,682
My friend Jenny'll let us
in Maitland's warehouse.

1099
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,968
We can be there when the shipment
comes in and nail 'em!

1100
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,122
How can you be sure
if it'll be drugs, or something?

1101
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,606
I got a hunch, OK?

1102
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,526
It's a technique by which many crimes
outside of Beverly Hills get solved.

1103
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,001
Why didn't you tell Bogomil
about this shipment?

1104
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,283
Bogomil does everything by the book.
You know what I'm startin' to think?

1105
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,568
That everybody
in this goddamn town is a robot.

1106
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,927
This thing is very personal to me.

1107
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:13,045
All they asked me to do
was drive you out of town.

1108
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,283
Now, I'm gonna screw that up, too.

1109
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,891
- [sighs] Boy.
- Billy. I love you.

1110
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,245
I just fell in love with you.

1111
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,886
Jenny, how you doing?
This is my good buddy, Billy Rosewood.

1112
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,371
- This is Jenny Summers.
- Hi.

1113
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,251
- Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?

1114
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,526
That's Serge.

1115
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,401
Yo, Serge, will you
get my friend an espresso?

1116
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,131
You want it with a lemon twist?

1117
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,682
Uh... Yeah, sure, if it's no bother.

1118
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,889
- No, don't be stupid.
- [chuckling]

1119
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,522
Axel, Victor Maitland was here
asking questions about you today.

1120
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,081
I'm telling you,
he was acting real weird.

1121
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,244
The reason I came down is 'cause
I want to get back inside the warehouse.

1122
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,483
- How 'bout I go with you?
- Jenny, come on, now.

1123
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,763
You work here with Serge,
in a art gallery. You're not a cop.

1124
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,888
Axel, if this has anything
to do with Mikey,

1125
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,929
then I want to go
check it out for myself.

1126
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,162
I don't have time to stand here
and argue with you.

1127
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,045
Wait a second. Let me get my keys...

1128
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,964
...and we'll argue on the way.

1129
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,081
Billy, your job's just to sit
out here and observe things.

1130
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,323
- Don't make a move until I get you.
- I don't see why I can't come in.

1131
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,562
You can't go in
'cause you're a cop in this town.

1132
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,200
You go in without probable cause,
they're gonna call it an illegal search.

1133
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,761
You know that. Or didn't they
teach you that in cop school?

1134
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,884
Sit tight. If I find some evidence
I'll come out and get you.

1135
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,122
- But you can't just...
- But nothing. Just be cool.

1136
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,648
If anything jumps off, I'll come
and I'll get you, all right? OK?

1137
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,370
Thank you.

1138
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,483
Any chance you're gonna give me that
key and let me go in there by myself?

1139
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,005
No chance.

1140
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,451
Fuck. Come on.

1141
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,124
Looks like they been here already.

1142
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,210
- What exactly are you looking for?
- This.

1143
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,569
This is a crate from overseas,
hasn't passed through Customs yet.

1144
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,771
[Jenny] What is that?

1145
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,210
Coffee?

1146
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,930
[Axel] Yeah, it's coffee on top.

1147
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,690
But this ain't sugar.

1148
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,525
- Go get Rosewood.
- Welcome to the party.

1149
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,763
Seems we have guests.

1150
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,888
How nice.

1151
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,128
I do like surprises.

1152
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,281
Jeannette.

1153
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:39,122
I just can't tell you how disappointed
I am to find you here.

1154
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,726
- Victor, listen I...
- Shut up!

1155
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,162
I don't want to hear it.

1156
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,647
Take her to the car
and wait for me, OK?

1157
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,365
What are you gonna do with him?

1158
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:13,242
I think you should be more worried
about what we're going to do with you.

1159
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,085
Jenny, don't worry about me.
We got cocaine and coffee here.

1160
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,163
We're gonna get wired
and have a big party.

1161
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,766
Thanks for havin' me over Vic,
this is very nice.

1162
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,889
You say something?

1163
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,445
[sighs]

1164
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,204
If somethin' happens to her...

1165
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,765
Mm?

1166
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,368
I'm all ears.

1167
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,966
...I'll kill you.

1168
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,841
Really?

1169
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,365
That would be a neat trick.

1170
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,924
Well, cuz.

1171
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,570
Are you still pissed at me?

1172
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,563
Oh, no. No.

1173
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,202
But I should've taken care of you
in Detroit.

1174
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,401
When I popped your little buddy.

1175
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,967
[grunting]

1176
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,691
[coughing]

1177
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,810
Goodbye, Mr. Foley.

1178
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,606
Have a nice day.

1179
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,731
[gasping] I'll try.

1180
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,321
[groans] Damn it.

1181
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,130
Oh, boy.

1182
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:28,410
How's that little bump on the head doin'
I gave you in Detroit, huh?

1183
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,130
Healed up nice, I hope.

1184
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,006
[grunting]

1185
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,486
[coughing]

1186
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,490
[Axel coughing]

1187
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,321
Freeze!

1188
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,321
[screams]

1189
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,441
Thanks, man.

1190
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,528
[tires screeching]

1191
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,882
Tell Taggart to check out the warehouse
and act on whatever he finds.

1192
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,201
I'll explain it to him later.

1193
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,488
DD-6, Sergeant Taggart is here now,

1194
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,369
<i>- and he wants to talk to you.</i>
- Shit!

1195
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:39,444
Billy, what the hell is goin' on?

1196
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,688
I'm sorry, Sarg, I can't talk now.

1197
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,649
What you mean you can't talk now?

1198
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,486
Just check out the warehouse and
please don't say anything to Bogomil.

1199
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,608
Sorry, sir, he's not
transmitting any more.

1200
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:51,921
- Ah, shit!
- What's the matter?

1201
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,323
It's Billy, he's doin' somethin'
dumb again, but I don't know what.

1202
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,925
Was he calling from the hotel?

1203
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,570
No, sir.

1204
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,722
Right now his car is heading north
on Palm Canyon Road.

1205
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,609
Hey, we were there this morning.

1206
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,649
- [Taggart] What?
- Yeah.

1207
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,041
Foley was up there,
looking over Maitland's house.

1208
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,770
Do you have the address
of that warehouse?

1209
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,086
Yes, sir.

1210
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,562
Here. You two check that place out.

1211
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,604
Then find me, and let me know
what the hell is goin' on over there.

1212
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,689
And don't talk to anybody but me!

1213
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,882
[car approaching]

1214
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,967
Hold it right there, Foley,
you're under arrest.

1215
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,446
Billy, what the hell are you doin' here?

1216
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,120
I stole my gun and forced him
to bring me here.

1217
01:23:47,121 --> 01:23:50,363
No, he didn't, Sarg. Look, everything
he said about Maitland is right.

1218
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,205
Now, he's kidnapped a woman
and he's got her in his house.

1219
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,970
Well, let's go in there and get her.

1220
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,724
What the fuck you think
I'm tryin' to do here?

1221
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,202
You're not doin' anything! We'll have
a search warrant in 20 minutes.

1222
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,204
- She'll be dead in 20 minutes.
- Stop workin' on that lock.

1223
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,921
I'm gonna open this door and I'm goin'
inside. You wanna stop me? Shoot me.

1224
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,924
- Me, too.
- Billy!

1225
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,447
You can do what you want,
but I'm going in with Axel.

1226
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,921
Goddamn it, Billy,
this is really serious trouble!

1227
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,128
If you're lucky, you'll just get fired.

1228
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,084
- [door opens]
- [Axel] Got it.

1229
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,203
[Taggart] It's my last warning, Foley.

1230
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,285
- Billy!
- I'm sorry, Sarg, I've got to.

1231
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,291
Shit. Wait a minute.

1232
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,001
- [beeping]
- [man] What's that?

1233
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:59,170
Looks like east gate. Punch it up.

1234
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,368
Who the hell is that?

1235
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,645
Better get Maitland up here.

1236
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,165
Where is everybody?
Owensby, is Rosewood back yet?

1237
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,163
- No, sir.
- Have you seen Taggart?

1238
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,129
He took off about ten minutes ago.

1239
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,208
Foley's on the grounds.

1240
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,169
Well, how the hell should I know?

1241
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,163
Get some people out there right away.

1242
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,168
Don't take your eyes off that screen.

1243
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,121
I want you to try to locate
Taggart and Rosewood.

1244
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,446
Come on.

1245
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,530
[grunts]

1246
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,250
[Taggart] OK, OK, OK.

1247
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,041
[grunting] Shit.

1248
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,964
[yelling]

1249
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,968
- They must be away from the car, sir.
- I can see that, keep trying.

1250
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,971
- DD-13, come in please.
- What's their 20?

1251
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,962
- 609 Palm Canyon Road.
- Who lives at that address?

1252
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,644
A Victor Maitland, sir.

1253
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,162
[gasping] Try again.

1254
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,685
Let's go around.

1255
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,484
We can do it. Come on.

1256
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,681
Ready?

1257
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,808
One, two...

1258
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,641
[grunting]

1259
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,328
[Taggart grunting]

1260
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,209
[chuckling]

1261
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,568
[machine gunfire]

1262
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,651
You all right?

1263
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,203
What the fuck am I doin' here?

1264
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,206
Drop it!

1265
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,642
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let's go.

1266
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,049
[machine gunfire]

1267
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,969
[all grunting]

1268
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,291
- Jesus Christ!
- Yeah, these guys are serious.

1269
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,090
I hate machine guns.

1270
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,005
Cover me.

1271
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,767
You guys go around front,
I'm gonna check the back.

1272
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,121
Sir, we have a report of shots fired
at that same location.

1273
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,282
609 Palm Canyon Road.

1274
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:31,244
Put out a 998: officers need assistance.

1275
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,129
- Undercovers on the scene.
- Sir?

1276
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,806
Just do it!
I want all north end units to roll.

1277
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,327
South end units stay in their area.

1278
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,084
Damn! Let's go.

1279
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,083
Undercover officers at location.

1280
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,968
Police! You're all under arrest!

1281
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,245
You do that again,
I'll shoot you myself.

1282
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,244
[spent shells clattering]

1283
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,243
You know what I keep thinking about?

1284
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,249
You know the end of <i>Butch Cassidy</i>?

1285
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:25,564
Where Redford and Newman
are almost out of ammunition.

1286
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,401
And the whole Bolivian Army
is out in front of this little hut.

1287
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,245
Billy...

1288
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,728
I'm gonna make you pay for this.

1289
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,281
[gunshot]

1290
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,247
[groaning]

1291
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,650
[siren wailing]

1292
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,763
- You gonna hang around here?
- Fuck no!

1293
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:13,930
[tires screeching]

1294
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,328
- Freeze it!
- Hold it right there.

1295
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,171
[Bogomil] Oh, shit.

1296
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,291
[Jenny] Axel!

1297
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,761
[gasping]

1298
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,444
Be careful, old boy, you might hit me.

1299
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,041
Freeze!

1300
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,485
[body thudding]

1301
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,970
Police! You're all under arrest!

1302
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,521
Lay down your weapons in front of you

1303
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:33,247
and take two steps back
with your hands up!

1304
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,566
Very good.

1305
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,561
Great.

1306
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,848
[indistinct radio chatter]

1307
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:53,162
[indistinct murmuring]

1308
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:02,245
What the hell's going on here?

1309
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,127
Oh, shit.

1310
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,442
- What's this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.

1311
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,888
Rosewood, how come
he isn't wearing cuffs?

1312
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,409
Well, he isn't actually in custody, sir.

1313
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,285
Well, place him in custody,
or would you like me to do it?

1314
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,721
Wouldn't you like to hear
my report first, sir?

1315
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,851
You have a report
that explains all this?

1316
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:26,801
Yes, sir.

1317
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:31,329
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.

1318
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:38,122
Well, sir, Ms. Jeannette Summers, the
manager of Mr. Maitland's art gallery,

1319
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,760
accidentally discovered large quantities
of a substance

1320
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,009
she suspected was cocaine
in the art gallery's warehouse.

1321
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,164
She immediately communicated her
discovery to Detective Axel Foley

1322
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,685
of the Detroit Police Force.

1323
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:53,444
Detective Foley was,
at the time, cooperating

1324
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:57,326
in a joint Beverly Hills-Detroit
investigation of narcotics trafficking.

1325
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,081
Detectives Foley and Rosewood,
responding to Ms. Summers' report,

1326
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,720
proceeded to the warehouse,
where Rosewood did, in fact,

1327
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:06,451
discover approximately
80 kilos of cocaine.

1328
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,682
Rosewood immediately
called for backup.

1329
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,842
And I dispatched our officers
to this location.

1330
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,322
Sergeant Taggart here,
was the first to arrive at the scene.

1331
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:18,484
And having probable cause
to believe a felony was in progress,

1332
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:22,531
Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood,
with Detective Foley

1333
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:26,446
present only as an observer,
and proceeded to enter the grounds.

1334
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,284
And in the course
of defending ourselves,

1335
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,523
we shot several suspects,
including Mr. Maitland.

1336
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,005
You expect me to believe that report?

1337
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,123
That's the report I'm filing, sir.

1338
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,890
Sergeant Taggart...

1339
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:49,962
Why don't you tell me what happened?

1340
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,761
Happened just like
the lieutenant said, chief.

1341
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:23,091
[chuckles] Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

1342
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,209
Thank you, sir.

1343
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,290
That report better be
on my desk in the morning.

1344
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:32,283
Yes, sir, first thing.

1345
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,081
You were lyin' your ass off.

1346
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:44,446
[both laughing]

1347
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,843
Why don't you go to the hospital
and get your shoulder looked at?

1348
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,485
Excuse me, sir.

1349
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,691
I was wondering if you could,
like, do me a favor, sir?

1350
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:05,402
- I think your favors are all used up.
- I understand.

1351
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,848
It's just that I was hopin'
you could call my Inspector Todd,

1352
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,322
my boss back home and straighten
things out, but that's all right.

1353
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,403
Guess I'm out of a job.
It's cool, though.

1354
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,881
I think I'm gonna stay in Beverly Hills.
I like it here.

1355
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,520
I'm gonna start my own
private investigation company.

1356
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,091
How's that sound?

1357
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,686
I will talk to Inspector Todd
first thing tomorrow.

1358
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,365
- Will you, really?
- Yes, you bet.

1359
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,761
- Thank you so much, sir.
- You're welcome.

1360
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:37,969
How you doin'? I'm Axel Foley,
checkin' out of suite 1035.

1361
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,646
One moment, sir.
I'll get your bill.

1362
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,524
- [Taggart clears throat]
- Hey! Guys!

1363
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:48,968
You all didn't have to see me off.
But I'm very moved by the gesture.

1364
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:52,727
Bogomil ordered us
to make sure you got out of town.

1365
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,520
You know, that doesn't even matter
to me, Billy. You know what matters?

1366
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,966
That you guys came down here.

1367
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:01,209
I'm all choked up on the inside
I got a lump in my throat.

1368
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:04,170
You look a little misty yourself there,
Taggart.

1369
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,163
- [man] There you go, sir.
- [Axel] Oh, thank you.

1370
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:10,211
Excuse me. The Beverly Hills Police
Department is picking that up.

1371
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,442
Oh, get outta here! Guys!

1372
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:16,127
That's the last straw. That was
the last straw, you guys are too nice.

1373
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:19,090
Sir, do you sell those
Beverly Palm robes down here?

1374
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,049
Yes, we do sir,
they're $95 apiece.

1375
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,123
Money is no object, put 'em on my tab.

1376
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,930
I have to have two of them, though.

1377
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:30,761
Billy, you saved my life, OK?

1378
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,888
I don't think I'll ever
be able to repay you.

1379
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,610
But as a token of my appreciation,

1380
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,366
I want you to have this
fine Beverly Palm robe.

1381
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,360
Each time you get out of the shower
and you're dripping wet,

1382
01:39:39,361 --> 01:39:42,079
for the rest of your life, I want you
to think about our friendship.

1383
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,924
I want you to think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.

1384
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,891
- Thanks, Axel.
- [laughs]

1385
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:56,364
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.

1386
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,727
Billy, take care of the tab, would you?

1387
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,682
- Hey, Taggart.
- Here you are, sir.

1388
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,604
This is for you.

1389
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,604
No, that's all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.

1390
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,522
I already have three of 'em in my bag.

1391
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,410
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

1392
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,403
- Take it easy.
- You're not gonna say goodbye?

1393
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,251
Why, ain't you guys gonna tail me
to the city limits, anyway?

1394
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,927
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.

1395
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,461
I was thinking about stopping off
and getting something to drink, though.

1396
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,568
Yeah, we sorta figured you would.

1397
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,231
That mean you guys
are gonna join me?

1398
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,648
I don't think so, Axel,
we're still on duty.

1399
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,129
Well, I don't think one beer's
gonna kill us, Billy.

1400
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,363
That's right, listen to Taggart here.
Lighten up, all right?

1401
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,091
One drink's not gonna kill us.

1402
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,605
[♫ Patti LaBelle: <i>Stir It Up</i>]

1403
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,886
[Axel] Hey, guys

1404
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,646
If you fall too far behind,
don't be afraid to honk, OK?

1405
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,484
Where we goin' anyway'?

1406
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:56,086
Don't worry about it,
just follow my lead.

1407
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:58,641
I know the perfect place.
You guys will love it.

1408
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,040
Trust me.
