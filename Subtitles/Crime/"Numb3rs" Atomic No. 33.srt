NUMB3RS 第4季第16集</font>

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,800
ALAN:
Non-Newtonian
fluids, right?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,220
CHARLIE:
Right, non-Newtonian fluids.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,880
A fluid whose viscosity

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,920
is variable based
upon applied stress.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,670
Yeah, see, Dad,
if you slap it...

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,020
it acts like a solid,
but if you poke it...

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,460
it's a liquid.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,210
This is, uh, in your
lesson plan why?

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,200
It's an interesting study in transitional
system analysis.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,470
Yeah, but I thought you teach
advanced number theory.

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,620
Well, the Riemann
zeta function, um...

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,840
What?

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,270
Students will get a kick
out of it.

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,870
And by the students,
you mean the teachers.

17
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,480
All right, you know what?
I think we're good, huh?

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,230
Hey,

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,810
looking good,
Professor Fleinhardt.

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,550
And I'm feeling good,
Professor Eppes.

21
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,050
Oh. Oh!

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,210
Uh, coffee, Alan?

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,430
Absolutely.

24
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,890
Oh, my.

25
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,320
More starch.

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:11,350
<font color=#4096d1>-=破烂熊字幕组=-
SYNC：无敌宝贝</font>

27
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,970
All seven seals of the Apocalypse
were shattered

28
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,050
when Germany invaded Poland
in 1939.

29
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,390
Hitler delivered Lucifer
into the world.

30
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,090
It's documented.

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,420
????

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,100
"They were given
authority

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,270
over a quarter of the earth."

34
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,300
World War II Europe--
that's a quarter of the earth.

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,430
Did you want
some coffee?

36
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,720
I'd love some.

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,820
"To kill with sword,
famine, plague,

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,860
and by means of beasts
of the earth."

39
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,920
What beast of the earth kills
more than man himself?

40
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,060
Thank you.

41
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,740
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,680
Here it comes.

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,340
Excuse me for a minute.

44
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,100
Reverend...

45
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,960
Walter...

46
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,330
Can somebody help us?

47
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,260
Craig...

48
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,880
All right, then you play back
in your stance, right?

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,400
Choke up and just punch it,
all right?

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,950
It's not a big
follow through.
Just punch it.

51
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,830
Punch it.

52
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,430
Okay.

53
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,060
Choke and punch.

54
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,840
Choke and punch it.

55
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,600
Are you enjoying this
at all?

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,960
Somewhat, I hope.
Yeah.

57
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,710
Beautiful weather,
sexy instructor--

58
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,420
what's not to like?

59
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,750
"Got a tight spot here.

60
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,210
Tight spot."
I'll say.

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,520
It's from <i>O Brother,</i>
 <i>Where Art Thou?</i>

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,280
 Uh, actually, it's from
 <i>Sullivan's Travels,</i> originally.

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,060
Maybe the best movie
ever made.

64
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,360
I would've thought
you would've been into <i>Heat,</i>

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,190
or something like that.
"

66
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,460
What are you giving me the high hat,
girlie?"

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,230
United States Attorney's Office
doesn't take the weekend off.

68
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,260
Brooks.

69
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,730
DON:
What is this?

70
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,620
ROBIN:
Patmos Church--

71
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,600
government classifies them
as a dangerous cult.

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,410
They're not allowed
to receive medical attention,

73
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,470
or see a doctor--
only God can heal.

74
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,800
Paramedics got
a 911 call from inside, 

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,650
looks like some
kind of mass poisoning.

76
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,520
So what are you doing out here?

77
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,810
You will not violate
our religious freedom!

78
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,770
The First Amendment
forbids your trespass.

79
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,770
Faith will heal
the righteous!

80
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,080
Normally we'd
break the gate,

81
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,190
but LAPD's already got
three lawsuits pending
from these wackos

82
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,460
and we're under
a consent decree.

83
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,800
ROBIN:
Okay, well, this
is some very gray first Amendment
real estate.

84
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,320
We believe in the power of the Lord,
not your wicked elixirs.

85
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,250
ROBIN:
Who called it in?

86
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,180
OFFICER:
Anonymous.

87
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,880
But we're sure it came
from an inside line.

88
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,280
Okay, well, if someone
in there wants help,

89
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,510
we might have grounds.

90
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,900
No.Stop! Stop!

91
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
You can't do this!

92
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,860
The First Amendment
forbids it.

93
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,270
You can't do it!

94
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,290
Read the First Amendment.

95
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,450
Let's go.
All right, back up.

96
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,930
It's okay, let them through.

97
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,040
God loves us, this is just
a message from him.

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,160
We're here to help you.
Let's go. Move back.

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,730
Back up, everybody.
Give us some room here.

100
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,570
"Nor did they repent their murders and
their magic potions."

101
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,470
Lady...

102
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,570
You don't even know who you are.

103
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,050
WOMAN: It's... coffee,
maybe... I...

104
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,380
Thank you.

105
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,770
Sure.

106
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,790
Is he going to be okay?

107
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,030
Patmos Church was
founded in 1978,

108
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,740
hit the NRM list in '93.

109
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,740
NRM?

110
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,010
"New Religious
Movement."

111
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,100
They feel the apocalypse

112
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,680
has been going on for 70 years.

113
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,320
Started with World War II--

114
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,520
and that the Book of
Revelation proves

115
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,420
that Hitler released Lucifer and
he is here on earth

116
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,320
specifically targeting them.

117
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,340
I thought cults believe they were
the first to get into Heaven.

118
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,510
Why are they still here?

119
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,170
We could call it a literal take
on theBible--

120
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,420
that only the
Chosen People,

121
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,850
144,000 Jews, were
raptured out in 1939.

122
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,260
Patmos believes
they're going to have to stay
here on earth

123
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,260
and fight with Lucifer for
their place in Heaven.

124
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,970
All right,
so how does this all relate

125
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,620
to refusing medical help?

126
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,140
I'm not really sure
that it does.

127
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,160
I mean, they've created
their own

128
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,550
littletrange patchwork
quilt of ideas.

129
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,930
Techs confirmed
the poison was arsenic--

130
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,270
delivered through the coffee.

131
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,070
You have two dead,

132
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,810
three in a coma,
and another 16 victims.

133
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,910
The ground water tested

134
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,830
normal and there's no residual
poison in the construction.

135
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,020
COLBY:
Jim Jones.

136
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,540
Instead of cyanide
in the Kool-Aid,

137
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,200
it's arsenic in the java.

138
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,410
Reverend Ezra makes the coffee
in the church kitchen

139
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,110
but he also leaves it
unattended.

140
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,050
So anybody has access to it.

141
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,790
Any chance we can track
the poison?

142
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,280
Arsenic is a common pesticide

143
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,040
and this area has
been an agricultural

144
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,090
for the past
hundred years, 

145
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,290
so,I think it could have
come from anywhere.

146
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,340
You know, this could really
be a hate crime.

147
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,250
Angry neighbors, ex-member
with a grudge,

148
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,010
maybe disgruntled parents.

149
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,510
Well, the church compound
is heavily fortified,

150
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,680
and they have locked gates,
barbed wire fences,

151
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,250
and they have security cameras
all over the place.

152
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,700
The up side
of being paranoid nut jobs.

153
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,600
Sunday was my day off.

154
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,680
 <i>I would say it's an inside job,</i>

155
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,350
'cause they have a
pretty extensive security system.

156
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,910
Uh, and how many members
in this cult?

157
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,680
Well, a thousand
at least.

158
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,300
I embrace in situ
experimentation

159
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,840
as much as any
physicist,

160
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,590
but next time you make
the aqueous odyssey.

161
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,920
Well, it'll work next time.

162
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,740
A scientist
is never

163
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,720
as diligent as when he himself is the experimental subject.

164
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,680
Hey, I was diligent!

165
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
Right now,
I'm calculating possible concentration-temperature
coefficients...

166
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,930
All right...

167
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,110
Charlie, come on,
please, focus?

168
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,890
Certainly.

169
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,750
On what?

170
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,660
There was
a mass murder attempt

171
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,110
at a cult church
this morning.

172
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,080
Attempt?

173
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,220
DON:
Yeah, arsenic.

174
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,650
Although, fortunately,
since 9/11

175
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,510
we've been stockpiling
the antidote.

176
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,640
Dimercaprol.

177
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,270
We saved most of them,
although, actually,

178
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,470
they tried to stop us.

179
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,690
Faith healers?

180
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,000
And I was
telling him

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,810
unless we have a thousand
psychopaths,

182
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,130
the poisoner's motives

183
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,970
and/or actions should
be easily detectable

184
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,800
according to normal
social dynamics,

185
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,020
whatever those are.

186
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,920
Social network analysis--

187
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,980
Bayesian network analysis--

188
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,650
will help me uncover
hidden dynamics

189
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,670
and covert architecture of this cult.

190
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,390
Well, I wouldn't
so readily discount the
"thousand psychopaths" theory.

191
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,970
I mean, what kind
of mindless cretins

192
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,560
"Creh-tins"...?

193
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,440
...would blind themselves
to the gifts of science?

194
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,830
How else would a Creator
reveal himself but through his creation; 

195
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,060
and to deny
the mind of that creation

196
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,400
is to deny the mind of God!

197
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,840
Isn't it "cree-tins"?

198
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,620
Did you know that Don's
favorite movie is

199
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,310
is a Preston Sturges comedy?

200
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,420
It's not <i>Heat?</i>

201
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,310
I know, right?

202
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,430
CRAIG:
What do you call this?!

203
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,110
REVEREND:
You're the one who
crossed the line.

204
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,960
Be angry with me for
getting medical help,

205
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,350
but don't shirk responsibility

206
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,380
for your sexual misconduct.

207
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,780
I'm 18! I'm an adult!
I can do what I want!

208
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,550
Hey, guys, keep it
in your own corners.

209
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,900
He thinks he can
just control me
like he always has.

210
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Things are going
to change.

211
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,280
What kind of things?

212
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,800
I spent the night
with my girlfriend.

213
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,130
I love Audrey and I'm done.

214
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,860
I'm done sneaking around.

215
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,650
I know how the government
regards us, Agent Granger,

216
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,990
but we are a church,
not a cult.

217
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,500
This was a hate crime.

218
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,200
We were attacked
because of our faith.

219
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,550
The kind of faith
where everyone

220
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,920
turns over power of attorney
to their leader?

221
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,790
We live in Lucifer's time,

222
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,450
forced to contend
with schemes that he
disguises as laws.

223
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,710
My flock looks to
me for guidance.

224
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,120
Well, they weren't so happy
with your decision

225
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,840
to let the paramedics
save their lives.

226
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,900
Sadly, there is a tradition at Patmos
of misinterpreting scripture on faith-
based healing.

227
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,730
Now, I've been working with
the Council of Elders
to change that.

228
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,880
Well, we're going to
need to take a look

229
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,220
at some church files--
records, history.

230
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,840
Sister Susan Doran will give
you everything you need.

231
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,800
I'll instruct her
to be cooperative.

232
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,330
Boy, that's the fourth
security camera we've passed

233
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,850
since they buzzed us
through the gate.

234
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,000
Extremist in Orwellian
paranoia

235
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,180
as well as stunted
religious beliefs.

236
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,240
Hey, so,
did you see anything

237
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,490
on that surveillance footage?

238
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,870
No outsiders got in,

239
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,350
and the coffee urns were
placed strategically

240
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,860
nowhere near all
those cameras,

241
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,120
so the enemy lies within.

242
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,790
Well, isn't it always so?

243
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,500
Uh, what do you think these
people are so afraid of?

244
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,680
Anybody not them.

245
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,930
They feel privy
to sacred information

246
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,770
that they're morally obligated to defend.

247
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,950
Ideologues tend
to demonize anyone who opposes them.

248
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,210
Mrs. Doran,

249
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,490
I'm Special
Agent Reeves.

250
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,940
These are Doctors
Fleinhardt and Eppes.

251
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,900
We're here to go through
your church records.

252
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,030
Yeah, we're just here
to help.

253
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,810
You've already put our souls
in jeopardy.

254
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,830
How are our people supposed
to meet the Father

255
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,390
with your noxious medicine
flowing through their veins?

256
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,470
Without
said "noxious medicines,"

257
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,250
you would have dozens now dead
instead of just the two.

258
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,650
Or has your zealotry
blinded you to that?

259
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,740
Hitler adopted
the cult of science.

260
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,900
Do you align with him?

261
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,180
Oh, those are
my choices here?

262
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,900
Hitler's science
or your religion?

263
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,080
Oh, my God in Heaven.

264
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,220
Do not take
His name in vain!

265
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,770
What is vain is
my appeal to Him

266
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,160
to grace you with some small
glimmer of rational thought.

267
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,540
Hey, that's enough.
Maybe you should
take a walk.

268
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,840
Yes, exactly.
So...

269
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,990
MEGAN:
Mrs. Doran, we respect
your religious freedom--

270
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,280
you can believe anything that you like--

271
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,140
We're just here to go through the church records, 

272
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,860
that's all.

273
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,530
We're neutral, you know?
Just scientists.

274
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,920
You're bricklayers,

275
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,790
paving the path to hell
with good intentions.

276
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,810
Coming?

277
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,250
I'll be right back.

278
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,630
Hey.

279
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,610
Audrey will
help you find the files you need.

280
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,190
Thanks, Audrey.

281
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,240
Wow, that's an awful lot
of cash.

282
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,820
Safer here
than under the eyes and hands
of Lucifer's moneylenders.

283
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,080
My father, Reverend
Richard Doran, founded Patmos.

284
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,330
We've been custodians
of the church's finances

285
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,250
and records
since the early days.

286
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,500
It's only a matter
of time

287
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,200
before Reverend Ezra
and his deceitful son

288
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
put an end to that
tradition, as well.

289
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,120
Mother... Craig is
a good person.

290
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,040
You never lied to me
until you met him.

291
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,290
My father passed away
last summer.

292
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,100
The church
is in a period of transition.

293
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,880
I'm sorry to hear that.

294
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,210
How did your father die?

295
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,150
Heart attack.

296
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,890
And then Reverend Ezra took over
the church?

297
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,080
Yes.

298
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,160
But he and Craig joined us
almost three years ago.

299
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,450
Heart attack...

300
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,630
Arsenic poisoning can sometimes
be misread as heart failure.

301
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,650
We're going to
want to exhume your husband's body.

302
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,500
Absolutely not.

303
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,730
His body, in life or in death,
is sacred.

304
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,710
Ezra agreed to the
exhumation on the condition

305
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,090
that he be present

306
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,650
to protect the sanctity
of Richard Doran's body.

307
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,340
Hm. Let's see
what we turn up.

308
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,270
Everyone present?

309
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,140
All done with the cutting.

310
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,190
I don't understand.

311
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,070
We all have normal levels

312
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,870
of heavy metal like arsenic
or mercury in our bodies.

313
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,470
Hair shows abnormal dosages.

314
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,040
Even a year later?

315
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,930
Well, they dug up Napoleon

316
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,230
and it worked on him,
so, yeah,

317
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,530
I think we still
got a window here.

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,650
Atomic absorption
spectrometry.

319
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,350
This bad boy zaps it all the way
from a liquid into free atoms,

320
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,180
measuring the concentration
of the arsenic.

321
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,930
Now, a normal person's hair
would read 10 to 20 PPB--

322
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:46,910
parts per billion.

323
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,370
And what about
a murder victim?

324
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,270
Above 10,000
will be fatal.

325
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,080
You did this.

326
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,460
Susan, we need to know

327
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,380
whether or not Richard...
We don't need
anything from them.

328
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,220
You're desecrating
my husband,

329
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,180
just like you
destroyed my church.

330
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,580
DAVID:
Mrs. Doran, please.

331
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,550
What does that mean?

332
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,030
your husband was murdered

333
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,440
？？

334
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,670
I was in Alaska on
a mission before he died.

335
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,200
Returned home to perform
his service, in fact.

336
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,460
And jumped
Susan Doran's place in line.

337
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,280
She wants to stand still
30 years in the past,

338
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,700
when Patmos consisted
of 11 people in tents

339
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,980
in an orange grove.

340
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,670
So everyone just follows a guy
who's been around

341
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,500
less than three years?

342
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,110
The council
isainfully aware of the prejudices against us--

343
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,670
prejudices that begin with the government
classifying us as a cult.

344
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,030
They believe
that I can move us forward,

345
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,010
see that our traditions
are recognized and respected.

346
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,890
Your tradition against
the Devil.

347
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,760
Don't you fight against him
every day?

348
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,140
Isn't that why this room exists?

349
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,630
<i>All right, top-level</i>
 <i>priorities-- Reverend Ezra.</i>

350
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,240
This is the percentage
for info in.

351
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,780
AMITA:
Oh, I thought that
was info out.

352
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,140
No, I've got information
moving out from Reverend Ezra.

353
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,340
Okay, so I need to rework
my equation for info out.

354
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,750
I hate to break this up,

355
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,450
but I was about to pass out
from the marker fumes.

356
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,960
Ah, yes,
that would be the lemon.

357
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,260
I told you
it was too much.

358
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,270
I like it.

359
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,100
It smells like a urinal cake.

360
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,860
Statement from Reverend Ezra.

361
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,310
Looks like there was infighting
for control of the cult.

362
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,010
Okay, that's excellent,
because it's that kind of concealed dynamic

363
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,940
that will help
uncover the motive

364
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,010
for poisoning the entire church.

365
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,750
Uh, in social
network analysis,

366
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,920
we examine the
differences

367
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,060
between the perception
of a group's structure

368
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,280
and its actual structure--
the hidden architecture.

369
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,110
In an apartment building,

370
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,350
 <i>hidden behind the walls,</i>
 <i>under the floors,</i>

371
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,900
 <i>are complex systems--</i>

372
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,180
 <i>plumbing, electricity,</i>
 <i>phone lines.</i>

373
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,360
 <i>While we may endow</i>
 <i>the penthouse</i>

374
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,490
 <i>as being the most powerful</i>
 <i>location in the building,</i>

375
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,400
 <i>the nerve center</i>
 <i>is actually in the basement.</i>

376
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,150
So using three variables--

377
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,460
connectivity, access,
and information--

378
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,160
we can map the way
in which Patmos functions.

379
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,680
And who's being left
in the dark.

380
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,930
Susan Doran... isn't this the
woman that you threw down with?

381
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,790
I... didn't say
"threw down."

382
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,390
You know, I was taken aback

383
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,220
by t intensity
of her intolerance, yes.

384
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,310
Aren't you the one
that told me

385
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,940
never to try to teach anybody
who doesn't want to learn?

386
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,810
My dad used to say,

387
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,310
"Don't talk religion unless
you're looking for a fight."

388
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,110
Your dad makes a good point.

389
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,040
ROBIN:
 <i>I found something interesting.</i>

390
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,970
Yeah, what's that?

391
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,620
in Patmos' latest appeal
for legal recognition,

392
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,070
Reverend Ezra added a list of nine practices
that he's changing,

393
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,880
including no more
prohibitions

394
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,740
against people seeking
medical help.

395
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,480
So what?

396
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,730
I mean, you think
he's going legit?

397
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,640
And trying
to make a ton of dough.

398
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,410
In property taxes alone,

399
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,170
they're paying
over six figures.

400
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,570
Members pay 75% of their
income to the church,

401
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,660
and Ezra controls
all of it.

402
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,170
If they go legit
and get tax-exempt status,

403
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,760
he gets millions more
to play with.

404
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,620
Goes to motive.

405
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,120
Right, but he
was in Alaska

406
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,780
for the other
reverend's murder.

407
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,740
Yeah, but he's still good
for the recent attacks.

408
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
Dose the congregation,

409
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,610
show them modern medicine
ain't so bad.

410
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,680
So, what, maybe, like, two
of them did the poisoning?

411
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,740
I know it doesn't seem likely,

412
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,270
but I don't have a lot to go on
in this "cockeyed caravan."

413
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,200
Wow, Preston Sturges,
 <i>Sullivan's Travels.</i>

414
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
I did my Don Eppes homework.

415
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,170
Opposition research, my friend--
you should try it.

416
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,930
All right.

417
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,500
Hey.
Hey.

418
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,950
So we've been studying the
hidden dynamics of your cult.

419
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,350
Not a cult much longer,
if Ezra can help it.

420
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,190
You know, that fits the pattern.

421
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,430
You see, overtly,

422
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,230
Reverend Ezra
is the leader

423
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,310
with a council and
members below him.

424
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,760
Yeah, we mapped out
more covert social networks--

425
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,490
power relationships,
financial status, marriages.

426
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,320
In the past, Susan Doran
was the connecting node--

427
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,510
the gatekeeper,

428
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,110
controlling the
flow of information

429
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,040
amongst all the
subnetworks.

430
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,560
Right, she had the safe
with all the records.

431
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,230
Yeah, she's been
the hidden power behind Patmos for 30 years.

432
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,480
CHARLIE:
However, we've noticed

433
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,300
that she's had less
and less influence

434
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,680
over the past
few years,

435
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,730
since her husband
and Reverend Ezra

436
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,700
began going on
missions together.

437
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,450
Ezra usurped her position.

438
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,430
Yeah, left her disconnected.

439
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,480
What, are you saying
she killed him for power?

440
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,170
Yeah, but it doesn't work, so
she loses status even faster.

441
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,210
Now she's got to reveal Ezra
as an impostor

442
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,680
by creating a situation
where he goes against church law

443
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,600
and has to use medicine
to save his son.

444
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,160
That's right-- so if she
mixed this poison at home,

445
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,700
you're going to find
trace amounts of arsenic.

446
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,020
ALAN:
 <i>You know what the best part</i>

447
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,360
about being
a student is?

448
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,380
If I don't pass
a reflective surface,

449
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,950
I'm convinced
that I'm 25 years old

450
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,590
and I'm, uh, about
to conquer the world.

451
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,810
Well, I surrendered all
my dreams of conquest

452
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,160
when I realized all I'd
have to show for it is...

453
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,270
the world.

454
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,310
Hey, hey, Larry,
what's eating you?

455
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,520
A particularly repugnant woman
who somehow manages

456
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,960
to link all science
with Hitler and the Devil.

457
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, come on, Larry.

458
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,360
It's not worth getting upset
about every crazy out there.

459
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,300
I know this!

460
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,830
I live in a monastery,
I meditate.

461
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,630
I-I believe in peace
and, and compassion

462
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,380
and tolerance,
but still

463
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,410
this woman, she triggered
such outrage in me.

464
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,640
I think that
people like that,

465
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,100
like this woman, they're just
looking for something--

466
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,770
they're looking for answers,

467
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,690
you know, maybe even some
of the answers that you are,

468
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,010
but just by, uh,
different means.

469
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,630
You cannot begin to justify this
woman's spewing of her venom.

470
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,110
N-N-N-No,I'm not, I'm not.

471
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,960
It's just that, um,
not everyone has the emotional

472
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,410
and intellectual resource

473
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,520
to search for God in a
supercollider.

474
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,050
People look for answers

475
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,020
in what's available to them,

476
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,900
and when they're
particularly desperate,

477
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,030
they latch on to the closest
answer that's available.

478
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,720
I mean,it may make them wrong

479
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,400
but not necessarily evil.

480
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,220
Yeah.

481
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,170
Listen, I know you're right.

482
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,270
All my life I have attempted

483
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:37,030
to find just that perfect point
of beauty and balance

484
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,390
between science
and spirituality,

485
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,780
where they
not only coexist,

486
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,050
they complete each other.

487
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,150
And I saw in this woman's...

488
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,970
rage and her ignorance

489
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:55,380
a complete caricature of my faith, 

490
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:02,020
and yes,I did match her bigotry
with my own.

491
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,760
God will rain His
justice on your heads.

492
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,690
I can live with that,
Mrs. Doran.

493
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,830
You're a faithless
charlatan!

494
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,200
You've spit on everything
we sacrificed our lives for!

495
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,350
You can't hide
in the church!

496
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,880
He will find you there!

497
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,250
We' positive
for arsenic residue in the
laundry room.

498
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,810
Okay, how conclusive
is this?

499
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,620
Heavy concentrations.

500
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,120
We're going to find it
all through the house.

501
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,860
Why would anyone want
to harm us?

502
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,960
It's indicative
of someone mixing water

503
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,350
and arsenic in a container,

504
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,960
not someone trying
to kill you.

505
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,200
Are... Are you accusing <i>me?</i>

506
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,360
Actually, Mrs. Doran,
I am arresting you.

507
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,680
Please...

508
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,950
This is Your test.

509
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,140
I can see that now.

510
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,550
Let me be strong enough...

511
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,880
Audrey!Hold on, I'm going to get you
out of there-- 

512
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,660
back up!

513
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,150
Craig, give me your hand.

514
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,100
You okay?

515
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,260
Can you walk?

516
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,490
Father--
in the kitchen.

517
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,820
Reverend Ezra!

518
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,820
(coughing):
Reverend!

519
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,180
Reverend Ezra!

520
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,100
Audrey.

521
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,460
My father?

522
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,670
Craig, we weren't able
to get to your father.

523
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,390
Hey, so, anyone else?

524
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,570
Just Reverend Ezra.

525
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,750
Craig Ezra, Audrey Doran,
they were shaken up a bit,

526
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,760
but they're going
to be just fine.

527
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,140
And you guys
are all right?

528
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,740
Yeah, I was going
to wait

529
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,020
for the fire department
to get here,

530
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,460
but Granger made me look bad
by running in there.

531
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,880
Ah, heroes.
Right, the
reluctant hero.

532
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,850
Hey, at least you got
to carry a girl.

533
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,670
So any idea
what caused it?

534
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,480
No, we don't know yet,

535
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,420
but the kitchen's hot
for arsenic dust.

536
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,880
It was clear yesterday.

537
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,160
Susan Doran?

538
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,950
She was cuffed and
in our custody.

539
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,160
But she could've
set a trap.

540
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,170
Well, maybe a kid.

541
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,770
Craig says he and Audrey
were here to meet with his dad.

542
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,750
Their alibi for the coffee
poisoning is weak.

543
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,520
I mean, the hotel has them
checking in and out,

544
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,900
but it doesn't mean
they were there.

545
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,060
DAVID:
So what do you think?

546
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,070
Kill Dad, put Mom in jail,
then they get married,

547
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,160
take over the church,

548
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,050
but that'd mean he
drank his own poison

549
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,500
and he sat on
his own bomb.

550
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,460
Right, so it makes him stupid
or a hardcore.

551
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,000
LARRY (over radio):
You know, it's really
your dad's insight

552
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,890
that led to the epiphany read my 

553
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,830
egregious behavior.

554
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,240
Goggles.

555
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,380
LARRY:
Okay.

556
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,780
Version 17...

557
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,920
No reaction.

558
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,630
Let's try intentional ignition.

559
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,340
All right, where was I,
by the way?

560
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,670
Uh, "epiphany"
and, uh...

561
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,420
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah...
"egregious
behavior."

562
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,920
There I was, I mean,
so self-righteously

563
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,690
attacking Susan Doran
but never realizing

564
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,830
that I was just projecting
my doubts onto her.

565
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,670
Doubts about, uh...
about what?

566
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,010
Well, about my
faith, you know.

567
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,100
I have to wonder, all these
questions I'm asking--

568
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,580
are they an expression
of my belief,

569
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,010
or are they just a failure
to surrender myself to it?

570
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,910
Larry, does it have to be
an "either-or"?

571
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,150
Hey, there's one
to grapple with.

572
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,710
LARRY:
You know, the monks say
there are no enemies,

573
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,820
just the unresolved within us.

574
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:11,890
Hey.

575
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,500
Hey, so... so we think heat accelerated arsenic dust

576
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,360
to create this fire.

577
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,820
 There was a similar
dust explosion

578
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,770
at a sugar factory in Georgia.

579
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,270
Wasn't that an accident?

580
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,160
LARRY:
Set off by sparking
heavy machinery.

581
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,030
Yeah. We've been
attempting to recreate the accidental combustion
all morning,

582
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,120
using kitchen appliances,

583
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,940
but nothing's
exploded yet.

584
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,880
Yeah, but that won't explain

585
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,870
what the arsenic was doing
there in the first place.

586
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,210
Which is why our next test

587
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,280
will be to determine if the
explosion occurred by design.

588
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,630
Uh, confidence is high
this wasn't an accident.

589
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,450
What does that do
to your network analysis?

590
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,860
Well, network analysis
was an analytic sledgehammer.

591
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,250
With the additional murder,
we've graduated to a scalpel--

592
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,570
affinity analysis.

593
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,150
Beer and diapers.

594
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,200
Oh, it's a
classic story,

595
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,580
most likely apocryphal,

596
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,990
 <i>all about a grocery store</i>
 <i>that wanted to know</i>

597
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,180
 <i>what items sold</i>
 <i>most often with diapers.</i>

598
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,290
 <i>They discovered it was beer.</i>

599
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,950
 <i>Now, from this they inferred</i>
 <i>that the wives</i>

600
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,770
 <i>had delegated the diaper-buying</i>
 <i>to their husbands,</i>

601
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,150
 <i>who consolidated this duty</i>
 <i>into their weekend beer runs.</i>

602
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,480
 <i>They started</i>
 <i>stocking the diapers</i>

603
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,860
 <i>next to the beer coolers,</i>

604
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,570
and increased their sales.

605
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,350
So, using
affinity analysis

606
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,460
 <i>and</i> association
 rule mining,

607
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,960
we determined that this
crime must have been

608
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,720
committed by
a partnership.

609
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,020
So we reexamined
the relationships

610
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,810
and behaviors of,
of your varied suspects

611
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,920
and it keeps leading us
back to Audrey.

612
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,650
MEGAN:
Susan's daughter?!

613
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,400
Okay, so Charlie says to
reinterview the suspects.

614
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,870
I think I could
have told you that.

615
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,340
But Audrey is the one
with no motive.

616
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,270
Not if she's helping
her boyfriend.

617
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,240
Or her mother.

618
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,590
I see the thinking.

619
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,160
I say she's a wedge.

620
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,450
That's our only move.

621
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,600
Thanks, Peter.

622
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,640
Oh, and Don?

623
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Quit browbeating
my assistant

624
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,470
for personal
information on me.

625
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,230
You gave me up?

626
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,760
I know where my
paycheck comes from.

627
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,630
Now, what
makes you think

628
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,580
that he would have
something juicy on me?

629
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,370
I'm thorough.

630
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,610
Oh, yeah?
What do ya got?

631
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,360
We'll see.
I'm still compiling.

632
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,400
Nothing.
You got nothing, Eppes.

633
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,730
And what about the hotel?

634
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,790
Was Audrey there with
you the whole time?

635
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,510
No. Not the whole time.

636
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,530
She left for an hour

637
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,010
for dawn prayers
with her mother,

638
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,070
but she came right back.

639
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,440
So she had time
to poison the coffee?

640
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,020
Audrey?

641
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,820
COLBY:
She was the only one
who didn't have an alibi

642
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,290
for all three of the crimes--

643
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,170
the fire, the poisonings

644
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,710
and the death of your father.

645
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,660
But she handed <i>me</i> the coffee.

646
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,560
The morning of the poisonings?

647
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,040
Yeah, first thing.

648
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,060
I mean...

649
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,510
she poured me a cup.

650
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,980
Right.
But she didn't have any herself?

651
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,180
No.

652
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,710
Oh, God...

653
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,900
What?

654
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,910
Well, before
the church exploded,

655
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,360
she called us over,
Father and me.

656
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,030
Audrey's the only person
in the entire church

657
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,650
who doesn't have an alibi for
all three of the incidents.

658
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,280
Why would she need an alibi?

659
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,410
Because we have
a statement

660
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,420
implicating her
in the poisoning.

661
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,080
What?

662
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,490
MEGAN:
Your daughter
set you up, Susan.

663
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,890
She killed your husband.

664
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,980
Is she working with Craig?
No.

665
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,770
Is she working
with you?

666
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,620
I know I am being tested.

667
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,870
We found arsenic
all over your house.

668
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,760
If it wasn't you, it was Audrey.

669
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,510
She had nothing to do with it.

670
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,190
I did it.

671
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,530
I did it all.

672
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,710
What did you do?

673
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,440
Poisoned the coffee.

674
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,560
Poisoned my husband.

675
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,890
Huh. This is wrong.

676
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,320
She's the wrong person.

677
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,070
It's not the outcome
we expected,

678
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,550
but they've got
their confession.

679
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,850
You know something?

680
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,540
I think you need to
arrest Craig Ezra.

681
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,530
Well, how you
figure that?

682
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,380
What we may have here
is the test of Solomon.

683
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,570
Now, if so,
Susan Doran just now

684
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,530
sacrificed herself
for her daughter.

685
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,200
Okay? You tried
to cut her baby in half.

686
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,360
e wouldn't let you,
no matter how much the cost to herself.

687
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,810
And then Craig fed her to the wolves.

688
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,380
That's it.

689
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,110
CHARLIE:
However, it's pretty
counter-intuitive

690
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,500
that he would put himself
in harm's way twice.

691
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,130
And still he survives.

692
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,550
Hold on.A Bible story's not
gonna trump a confession.

693
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,800
No, I mean, obviously,
with real stories of faith,

694
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,720
you know, they don't
have easy answers,

695
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,620
but this story <i>does</i> give
us a place to find them.

696
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,470
All right,
you know what?

697
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,660
Given the results
of the interviews,

698
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,360
why don't... why don't
you give us some time

699
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,920
to revisit
our affinity analysis?

700
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,340
 All right, good.
Go for it.

701
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,580
CHARLIE:
 <i>All right, so,</i>

702
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,600
 <i>well, this isn't working.</i>

703
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,300
Craig-slash-Audrey

704
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,440
and Craig-slash-Susan
have low support values.

705
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,520
Craig alone has
a low predictive value.

706
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,470
I'm thinking we circle back,

707
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,380
try a K-optimal
pattern discovery.

708
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,840
Charles...

709
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,930
What are we missing here?

710
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,970
Aside from a positive result?

711
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,370
Reverend Ezra.

712
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,640
I'm put in mind
of one Abimelech,

713
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,700
who slays his clan

714
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,110
in order to rule his
family and his kingdom.

715
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,120
Slay your clan,
poison your church.

716
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,430
After murdering
his own people,

717
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,440
God condemns and
kills Abimelech,

718
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,170
but not for his sins
against his people.

719
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,400
No, it was for dishonoring
his father, Gideon...

720
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,240
who was already dead.

721
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,620
Wow. I really don't
understand the Bible.

722
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,530
Well, the point
I'm making here

723
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:43,550
is that a father's influence
over his son can define him,

724
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,690
and maybe even drive him.

725
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,210
So Ezra-... slash-Craig.

726
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,800
That's a relationship we
haven't been focusing on.

727
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,750
DAVID:
Before 1998,

728
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,510
a Joseph and Emily Ezra lived in Bangor, Maine,

729
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,980
They went to work,
went to school,

730
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,000
they paid taxes...
and then... nothing.

731
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:12,370
Now, between 1998 and 2005,
the Ezras did not exist.

732
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,830
No credit cards, no drivers'
license, no taxes--nada.

733
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,640
Then Joseph and Craig Ezra
showed up at Patmos.

734
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,070
So what happened in 1998?

735
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,050
I think the real Joseph
and Emily Ezra, they died.

736
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,670
A car crash.

737
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,580
The bodies were burned
beyond recognition,

738
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,630
no match to dental records,
the identities went unknown.

739
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,350
1998.

740
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,170
Portland, Maine.

741
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,030
I know you got more than this.

742
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,580
Yes, I do.

743
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,760
Before the Ezras went missing...

744
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,050
they had a foster child.

745
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,020
MEGAN:
That would be Craig.

746
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,770
Craig?

747
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,550
Hey, Craig, we're gonna
need to speak to you
for a second.

748
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,110
What for?

749
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,680
Just want to talk to you.

750
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,960
About Audrey?

751
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,810
Me?

752
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,630
This is Eppes.
You need to run
California plates:

753
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,650
four, David, ocean,
queen, six, seven, eight.

754
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,830
You all right, Colb?

755
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,910
Yeah. Yeah.

756
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,310
？？

757
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,360
And we got no bites
on the APB.

758
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,770
DAVID:
William Boone.
Bunko has a long rap sheet on this guy; 

759
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,790
he's got
short cons, fraud, scams,

760
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,960
been in and out of jail.

761
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,620
He drops off
the radar in 2005.

762
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,030
COLBY:
William Boone and Craig set up
shop at the Church

763
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,730
as father and son,
Joseph and Craig Ezra,

764
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,830
working a long con.

765
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,400
Life con.
You don't get into the tax-exempt business
looking for a quick buck.

766
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,980
Boone had
a retirement plan.

767
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,780
Okay.
DAVID:
Craig kills reverend Doran while
Ezra-slash-Boone is away.

768
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,140
And Boone poisons the coffee
while Craig's away.

769
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,560
This way, they both alibi out
for the other murder.

770
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,070
And I think church poisoning
was meant to be minimal.

771
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,090
You know, just enough
to sicken people

772
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,950
and give Patmos the option of accepting
medical treatment.

773
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,440
DAVID:
They drop controversial
beliefs, 

774
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,750
including the mandatory
faith-based healing.

775
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,010
They fall off the cult list,

776
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,660
get recognized
as a real church,

777
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,370
get the tax-exempt status.

778
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:47,930
So what are you thinking?

779
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,250
Boone gets greedy
and uses more poison than planned?

780
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,200
Yeah, Craig drinks it

781
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,910
'cause he thinks it's going to be mild,

782
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,930
ends up almost dying.

783
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,640
So, to pay Boone back,
he decides to blow him up.

784
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,270
And these guys go to war against each other,

785
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,120
but at the same time,

786
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,560
they keep pointing the finger
at Susan Doran.

787
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,320
MEGAN:
So Craig's got three years
invested in this scam.

788
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,160
Now he's out in the cold,
he has nothing.

789
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,030
And that church has
a safe full of money.

790
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,050
I bet he's just
obsessing about it.

791
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,250
Sure. All right, he knows
better, but he's a con artist,

792
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,440
so he's always going to be
thinking about that score.

793
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,000
Audrey?

794
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,510
If she agrees,
we can run a sting on Craig.

795
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:20,990
Sure.

796
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,810
And if I don't agree?

797
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,650
Then he gets away
with killing your father

798
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,320
and destroying
your mother.

799
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,980
Audrey, he gave us
enough testimony

800
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,120
to get you the death penalty.

801
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,010
He literally
threw you at us.

802
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,390
He was scared.

803
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,390
He was scared he'd get nailed

804
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,400
for blowing up that church,
killing his dad,

805
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,410
and trying to kill you.

806
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,380
He never tried to kill me.

807
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,450
Audrey...

808
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,670
he left you
in a burning building.

809
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,570
He loves me.

810
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,080
There's somebody that loves you,

811
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,560
it is just not Craig.

812
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,790
MEAGAN:
If it wasn't you,
it was Audrey.

813
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,930
SUSAN:
She had nothing to do with it.

814
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,940
I did it.

815
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,870
I did it all.

816
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,160
You did what?

817
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,630
Poisoned the coffee.

818
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,650
Poisoned my husband.

819
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,270
Oh, dear.

820
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,570
You all right? Here.

821
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,560
Let me give you a hand.
I got it.
Thanks.

822
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,450
There you go.

823
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,960
Oh, I think this cappuccino
is a vanished dream.

824
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,050
Have the regular stuff.

825
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,990
Hey, nice turnaround
on Susan Doran.

826
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,780
Well, it's no easy thing.

827
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,930
I'll tell you-- separating the ugliness
of her dogma

828
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,540
from the sincerity
of her faith.

829
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,230
Yeah, I agree.

830
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,570
You know, with your job,
there's so many horrific things

831
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,740
that you hear people say or do.

832
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,990
How do you
shrug that off?

833
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,920
Alcohol.
(chuckles)

834
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,400
No, look, I-I try to remember

835
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,510
the job's more
important than me.

836
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,220
Well, we all pray at our own
unique altars, don't we?

837
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,480
Well...

838
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,990
you know, I think
of religion as a...

839
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,410
a really good police force,
you know?

840
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,100
It keeps 90% of
the people honest

841
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,190
and then we worry
about the other ten.

842
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,530
That's religion.How about belief?

843
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,310
Well, look,

844
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,270
you know we weren't a big
"God house."

845
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,760
I just always figured
one exists, but...

846
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,980
that's pretty much
the extent of it.

847
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,580
Pascal's Wager.

848
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,920
One lives as if God exists.

849
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,490
If He does,
your gain is infinite.

850
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,950
If He doesn't, well,
you've lost nothing.

851
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,430
Think Vegas gives odds on that?

852
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,080
You don't feel any...
any emptins in this?

853
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,470
Ah, well, hence the alcohol.

854
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,620
Well...

855
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,880
They let my mom go an hour ago.

856
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,750
I think they're
going to arrest me.

857
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,000
CRAIG (on phone):
The church has been tainted by outsiders.

858
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,210
We have to rebuild it.

859
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,360
How?

860
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,570
We need the money.

861
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,400
It's the right thing to do.

862
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,180
I mean, you know
the combination.

863
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,140
To start again, we need a lot.

864
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,010
As much as you can take.

865
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,520
Okay.

866
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,950
Okay, yes.

867
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,200
Where should I meet you?

868
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,330
Union Station in an hour,
main entrance.

869
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,590
Audrey, I love you.

870
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,870
I love you, too.

871
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,640
All right, there he is.

872
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,470
We moving in?

873
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,600
No, let him take the bag.

874
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,040
What if he wants to take her with him?

875
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,470
Don't worry,
not this guy.

876
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,960
I wasn't sure.
I didn't think think you were
going to make it.

877
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,460
How much did you get?

878
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,290
I don't know, a lot.

879
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,960
Okay, look, go back to Patmos,

880
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,340
and, um...I'll call you as soon
as I find a safe place.

881
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,190
Craig...
Trust me, Audrey.

882
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,380
This is for the best.

883
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,740
Bitch!

884
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,520
Move!

885
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,660
Audrey, come with me.

886
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,760
Not sure where
you're going, buddy.

887
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,610
DAVID:
I'm pretty sure the top of this
tower doesn't come out in Mexico.

888
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,820
Clear the bottom!
Clear the bottom!

889
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,260
DAVID:
Come on, Craig!

890
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,380
We know who you really are.

891
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,170
You're not
the jumping type!

892
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,310
COLBY:
Freeze!

893
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,170
DON:
Don't move!Freeze!

894
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,130
Take it easy.

895
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,420
Nice and easy.

896
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,420
That's it.

897
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,600
Now get your hands
on your head.Get them up!

898
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,780
She told me to do it.

899
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,450
Everything.

900
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,570
"She"?Which one?

901
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,180
Audrey.

902
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,310
Audrey told me to do everything.

903
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,690
DAVID:
Seriously?

904
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,360
I bet Colby 20 he'd blame Susan.

905
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,790
WOMAN (on TV):
...stay out of town.

906
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,480
MAN (on TV):
Thanks.

907
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,320
I know 50 times as much about trouble
as you ever will.

908
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,030
Besides, you owe it to me.

909
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,840
You sort of belong to me,
when you're a hobo.

910
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,250
I found you.
Careful.Careful, 

911
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,330
I tell you it's absolutely out
of the question.

912
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,890
You know every line?

913
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,190
Not on purpose.

914
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,590
Yes?

915
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,250
Thanks for not making me
watch <i>Heat.</i>

916
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,310
Oh, I forgot.

917
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,140
For you.

918
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,970
Chocolates?

919
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,340
You know what,
not a big fan.

920
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,750
I don't know anyone who
doesn't like chocolate.

921
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,230
Mm, I expected better investigative prowess
from you, Agent Eppes.

922
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,700
I see-- so that's it? You're not
even going to open them?

923
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,880
Okay.

924
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,800
It's watermelon?
Aha.

925
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,250
That's my favorite.
Ha, ha, ha.

926
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,100
How did you know?

927
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,640
No one knows.

928
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,820
Ball's in your court, kid.

929
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,480
Yes, I'll follow you
and I'll holler,

930
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,620
"This guy's a phony,
ladies and gentlemen.

931
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,790
"This is Sullivan, the big
director from Hollywood.

932
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,710
A phonus-balonus,
a faker, a heel..."

933
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,650
MAN 2:
If I man join
in the controversy, sir...

934
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,210
Emergency retrieval
equipment?

935
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,290
Check.
Drying mechanism, check.

936
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,390
Okay, have we
thought of everything?

937
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,470
Only one way
to find out.
Break.

938
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,120
I don't know,
it kind of looks like it did the
other day but...

939
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,310
Um, all righty, wish me luck.

940
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,430
Oh, wait, wait,
Charlie, you forgot to take your shoes off.

941
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,510
No, I didn't.

942
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,650
Okay, who's next?

943
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:15,000
