What could be simpler? All you
have to do is fill in the blanks.

this is no huge problem.

You should be able to fill
out a form correctly!

12
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,784
Then I'll just have to
get somebody who can.

anybody I could talk to?

is she's dead

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,443

00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,917
So do you got an idea
what the murder weapon is?

167
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,952
Well, it's not as clean
as a knife, reg.

168
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,888
You see that jagged edge
on the wound there?

169
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,723
It's not big enough
to be scissors,

170
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:24,891
so I figure it must be
something smaller.

Well, if I'm not mistaken,
Mr. spikings,

181

is a homicide.

can go to hell.

00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,960
With all due respect,

185
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,862
I'm in charge
of white house security.

186
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:06,733
With all due respect, I'm the
president's national security adviser.

187
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:09,335
A woman murdered
in the white house

188
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,270
40 yards from where
the president sleeps

189
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,173
is a matter
of national security.

190
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,408
Alvin Jordan.

191
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,810
Yes. Harlan Regis,
homicide.

192
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,612
Sir, do you happen
to know what she was doing

193
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,248
working here so late
on a Friday night?

194
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,251
Well, the government doesn't shut
down just because it's Friday.

195
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:28,087
Ah, yes. I understand.

196
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,725
Oh, and do you know how many
people were in the white house?

197
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,495
31.

198
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,230
31?

199
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,231
Yeah.

200
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,232
Yeah.

201
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,834
Carry on, detective.

202
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,070
Thank you, sir.

203
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,973
We'd like you to avoid
using 2 words

204
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,841
if you give any statements
to the media.

205
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,743
The words
are woman and murder.

206
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,645
You say all information
will be forthcoming

207
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,715
on an appropriate
and timely basis.

208
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,684
Mr. spikings...

209
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,119
One more thing.

210
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,553
I'm gonna need
everything you have

211
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,755
on what she was
working on...

212
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,223
you'll get
what's material.

213
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,959
Well, this is D.C., and,
unfortunately, she's mine.

214
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,194
She was murdered
in the white house,

215
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,595
not in some alley
out in southeast.

216
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,596
She was killed
in my city.

217
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,133
She was killed
in my house.

218
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,836
Don't you ever forget that.

219
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,473
He's all yours.

220
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,413
Hey, I'm just trying
to do my job.

221
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,649
Oh,
I guess I'm supposed

222
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,019
to get my briefings
from CNN, right?

223
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,021
No, you get it from
your secret service liaison

224
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,622
for the task force.

225
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,457
Well, he didn't
assign me one.

226
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,493
Yes, he did.
Nina chance.

227
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,533
I see. They think
I'm boo boo the fool.

228
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:48,935
Excuse me?

229
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,170
So I guess he figures that
I'll be easier on you

230
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,139
than I would some rookie
with acne, right?

231
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,741
Detective,
I'm an on-line agent

232
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,910
for the United States
secret service,

233
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,245
which means,
among other things,

234
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,647
that I'm fully qualified
to answer any questions

235
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,282
relating to white house
security.

236
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,483
Furthermore, I resent
the implication...

237
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,153
furthermore, you resent
the implication?

238
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,487
Man.

239
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,424
People don't even speak
English in this town anymore.

240
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,662
[Sighs]

241
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,231
Detective,
it's this way.

242
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,666
I know that.

243
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,901
There's been
no statement yet

244
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,103
about what's happening
in the white house.

245
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,072
We've been told only
that the first family

246
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,007
is at camp David
for the weekend.

247
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,708
As you can see behind me,

248
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,278
the immediate area
has been sealed off.

249
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,048
Sheldon turcott,
CNN, at the white house.

250
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:41,120
Why kill someone from
the office of protocol?

251
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,789
Maybe she sat some ambassador
in the wrong seat.

252
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,591
Oh, they kill you
for that now?

253
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,692
Tough town.

254
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:47,860
If I would have known,

255
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,161
I would have put
a turnstile in here

256
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,997
and charged admission
or something.

257
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:51,998
Who else was here?

258
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,065
Um, secret service.

259
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,500
They started
around 11:15.

260
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,136
And can you believe they
even took her garbage?

261
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,570
Anyway,
if you guys want me,

262
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,571
I'll be downstairs,
101.

263
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,806
Thank you
very much.

264
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,009
Anytime.

265
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,757
Wait a minute.

266
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,392
The body's found at 11:00,

267
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,130
and the feds arrive here
15 minutes later.

268
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,065
How do they do that?

269
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:30,002
Yeah. They don't even have
cool sirens like we do.

270
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,039
Look at her photo album.

271
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,474
Look at this, Regis.

272
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,743
Is this the only one?

273
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,811
It's the only one
I see,

274
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,280
but, you know,
I just got here.

275
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,882
I can tell you that the
apartment is registered

276
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,884
in the name of,
uh...

277
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,553
Brookland
associates,

278
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,523
but that is about all
I have right now.

279
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,070
Psst.

280
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,079
Wow. 1.2 on the beach.

281
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,480
White house giving out

282
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,683
some pretty sweet Christmas
bonuses this year.

283
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,486
Yeah,
looks that way.

284
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,557
I want a complete list of
everybody in-house last night

285
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,959
between 9:00 and 11:00,

286
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,396
and don't tell me
that is classified.

287
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:37,270
Quick on the draw,
huh, agent chance?

288
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,376
There's only 30 names here.

289
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,345
All whereabouts
accounted for.

290
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,516
Spikings told me
that there were 31.

291
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,621
I mean,
I see his name here.

292
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,457
So whose name
is missing?

293
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,762
Well, apparently, agent
spikings was mistaken.

294
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,665
The count is 30
in-house.

295
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,706
Better check it out.

296
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,708
I'm on it.

297
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,850
So, agent chance,
where you from?

298
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,586
Iowa.

299
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,121
Iowa, huh?

300
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,123
So why
the secret service?

301
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,991
I mean, why not...

302
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,360
Why not
kindergarten teacher?

303
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,195
No, you don't look like
one of those at all.

304
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,596
I was in the Olympics.

305
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,465
The Olympics?

306
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,967
That's how I got
in the secret service.

307
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,369
Is that right?

308
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,570
I was on
the sharpshooting team.

309
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,273
I met president Reagan.
It was in 1988.

310
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:50,042
One of his agents
was a woman.

311
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,278
She sort of took me
under her wing.

312
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,248
Mmm. Sharpshooting. Ha.

313
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,649
I feel safe already.

314
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,188
I brought home the gold.

315
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,491
Wow.

316
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,929
Chance: Where are we going?

317
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,466
Regis: To my place.
I gotta change.

318
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,304
You're being evicted?

319
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,471
The whole damn building.

320
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,739
The feds
are tearing it down

321
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,909
to put up a parking
garage for the, uh...

322
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,245
For the, uh...

323
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,846
Interstate commerce
commission.

324
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,248
Yeah.

325
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,016
What do they need a parking
lot around here for?

326
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,785
Hell if I know. I've been
trying to figure that out.

327
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,356
Whole building thinks that I
can fix it because I'm a cop.

328
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,958
Harlan, what's going on?

329
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,093
Mrs. Wallace.

330
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,628
Look, in less than a month,

331
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,396
we're going to be living
out on garbage cans.

332
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,132
I'm making progress,
Mrs. Wallace.

333
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,699
Truly I am.
Progress?

334
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,435
Is that what you call it?

335
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,469
Progress.

336
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,671
I should say you are
making some progress.

337
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,241
You better take care of your business, boy.
You know that?

338
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,775
That's what you
should be doing

339
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,010
is taking care of your business.
Making progress.

340
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,181
I know what he's
making progress at.

341
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,521
All right, make
yourself comfortable.

342
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:22,335
Washington city,
July 21, 1861.

343
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:27,306
And this is manassas,
first battle of bull run.

344
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,376
Come here. I want
to show you something.

345
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:35,481
Right here, that's where stonewall
Jackson got his nickname.

346
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,184
That's sutley Springs there.

347
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,386
Civilians used to come
on that crest over there

348
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,054
and take carriages and
picnics to watch the battle.

349
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,558
Amazing, huh?

350
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,026
How did you...

351
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:51,197
I'm a homicide cop in the
homicide capital of the world.

352
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,799
It's cheaper
than a shrink.

353
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,635
You did this
all by yourself?

354
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,637
Mm-hmm.

355
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,871
Yep.

356
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,307
The whole thing.

357
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,609
My father was
a history buff,

358
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,844
so I guess it kind
of rubbed off on me.

359
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,279
And what did he do?

360
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,782

The speaker
of the house.

542
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,082
Yeah. How you doing?
How you doing?

543
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,716
Good, thanks.

544
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,885
Hey, listen, do you
ever speak to anybody

545
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,688
at the interstate
commerce commission?

546
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,370
I... i assume that
organization or something...

547
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,838
I'm not really sure...
but they're evicting me.

548
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,906
In fact,
they're evicting...

549
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:32,177
excuse me. Mr. speaker?

550
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:35,114
The detective's services
are needed elsewhere.

551
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,117
Don't worry about it.
I'll... I'll call you.

552
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:40,885
Right.
Yeah.

553
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,420
What are you
doing here?

554
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,021
I'm trying
to find you.

555
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,557
Look, the task force
is closed.

556
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,825
We have a suspect.

557
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,428
Yeah. Me, too.

558
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,663
Who's that?

559
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:56,301
He's secret service. You should know.
Who is he?

560
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:57,835
I can't tell you.

561
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,437
What, is that
classified, too?

562
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:00,538
Yes, it is.

563
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,042
Ok. I'll just have to
find out for myself.

564
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,618
There he is right there.

565
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,987
The one who just stepped to the podium.
That's him.

566
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:17,988
What's his name?

567
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,091
I can't
tell you that.

568
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:21,592
Well, look,
either you help me,

569
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:25,063
or I'll have to
find out the loud way.

570
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,333
All right.

571
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,134
Please.

572
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:30,135
What's his name?

573
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,169
Burton cash.

574
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,871
Who's he
assigned to?

575
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,174
Kyle Neil.

576
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,476
The president's son?

577
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,286
Ladies and gentlemen...

578
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:49,687
It brings me great honor

579
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:52,290
to present the first lady
of the United States,

580
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,526
Mrs. kitty Neil.

581
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,678
If the bodyguard
was there,

582
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,447
that means that Kyle
was on that boat as well.

583
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,716
Kitty:
...Domestic violence

584
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,986
has shattered 3 more homes
in America.

585
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:25,923
Kyle Neil was having an
affair with Carla town.

586
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:29,660
He's the one who had sex
with her that night.

587
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,896
You should transfer
up here right now.

588
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:36,701
Kitty: Silence is the lie
that says all is well.

589
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:37,802
I've got to go.

590
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:38,637
Hey, hey, hey,

591
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,605
how long do you
think it'll be

592
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:41,272
before the media
finds out

593
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:45,743
that the president's son was banging
her an hour before she died?

594
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,078
I've got to go.

595
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,580
Nice dress.

596
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:52,250
Kitty: ...With industry,
and concerned citizens

597
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:54,452
and say it's enough?

598
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:57,388
You are to have no further
contact with detective Regis.

599
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,157
Is that understood?

600
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,892
What if he initiates
contact, sir?

601
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,062
Then I want a report,
detailed and immediate.

602
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:07,164
Written?

603
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,700
Beginning with what
you two just discussed.

604
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:10,968
Right now.

605
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,838
[Applause]

606
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,197
[Dance music plays]

607
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:18,002
Kyle?

608
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,004
Excuse me.

609
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,240
Kyle?

610
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,075
Kyle?

611
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,076
Uh...

612
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,177
We used to date.

613
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,648
Then you know
how it works.

614
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,669
I think you should
get some revenge.

615
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,070
Excuse me?

616
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,540
You should get
revenge.

617
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:58,376
And how do I go about
getting that?

618
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:00,511
Move to New York,
become a big model,

619
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,447
don't take his phone
calls anymore...

620
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:03,982
Interesting.

621
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,518
I need a drink.

622
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,219
Would you like one?

623
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,220
Your treat?

624
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,221
Uh-huh.

625
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,423
Sure.

626
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:13,624
What would you like?

627
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,225
Whatever the lady's
buying.

628
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,327
Bourbon?

629
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:17,696
Nice.

630
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,505
After 2 bourbons, she's telling
me his underwear preference

631
00:38:27,506 --> 00:38:29,507
and that his one
mission in life

632
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:32,176
is to get laid in every
room in the white house.

633
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,612
That sounds
like a plan to me.

634
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,246
She even
told me this...

635
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,915
she said once Kyle
even bragged

636
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,418
about sharing a mistress
with his father.

637
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,086
Carla town?

638
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,688
Well, she
wasn't sure who.

639
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,322
Well, it gets
better than that, man.

640
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,393
Her uncle's company,
brookland associates...

641
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:52,329
leading east coast
fund-raiser for Jack Neil.

642
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,330
Really?

643
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,899
I mean, the company

644
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,534
that leased the president's
campaign space

645
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,302
owned her apartment.

646
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,905
Well, this is good.

647
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:02,640
This is very good.

648
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:05,543
I hope you know
what you're doing.

649
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,044
Good night, now.

650
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,046
Night, dear.

651
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,860
What, do you want
to see my badge?

652
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:31,663
Why did you come here?

653
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:44,041
So I'm digging...

654
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,511
I'm going through
the people magazine

655
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,879
and just happened
to come across page 16.

656
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,116
I find a picture of Kyle
coming back from Brazil,

657
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:56,186
and you're standing next
to him with an earpiece.

658
00:40:56,187 --> 00:41:00,525
You know, I must have looked at 18
months of pictures of this guy,

659
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:02,059
and you know what I found?

660
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,096
I found that you
were in over half of them.

661
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:10,034
You were on his detail
and you didn't tell me.

662
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,301
Until when?

663
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,470
I have nothing more to
discuss with you about this.

664
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,305
The case is closed.

665
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,743
Agent chance, when did they
remove you from Kyle's detail?

666
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:20,745
You show up here
grilling me about work?

667
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:21,879
Just answer
the question.

668
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,247
Don't come
to my home again.

669
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,414
Answer the question!

670
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,850
You waltz in here

671
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:29,253
expecting me to violate
every oath I've ever taken.

672
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,689
I have a duty
to protect!

673
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,357
Your duty could send
an innocent man

674
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,792
to prison for the
rest of his life.

675
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,895
Are you comfortable
with that?

676
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,900
I... i think
you should leave.

677
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:46,036
How is that spikings finds
a button in the bathroom

678
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:49,306
that no other
detective found, huh?

679
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,375
What, did he plant it there?

680
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:53,277
I asked you to leave.

681
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:54,645
Did he plant the button?

682
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,915
I don't know, ok?

683
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,753
Everybody's
lying around here.

684
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,331
Ok, so again...

685
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:18,603
Why did they remove you
from Kyle's detail?

686
00:42:18,604 --> 00:42:20,606
They didn't
remove me.

687
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,477
One night...

688
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,479
I heard sounds...

689
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,616
Of violence... fighting...

690
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:33,151
coming from
his apartment.

691
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:37,655
So I went in,

692
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:39,990
and I found him...

693
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:42,327
Beating up
his girlfriend.

694
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,563
And it was ugly.

695
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,366
And they...

696
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,901
We...

697
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,238
Covered it up for him.

698
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,309
That was even uglier.

699
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:05,984
And that's when I asked
to be reassigned.

700
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,693
Look, Nina,

701
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,662
I don't know what I
would do if I was you,

702
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:19,664
but I do know
one thing.

703
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:21,398
I could not let
an innocent man

704
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:24,235
fry for something
he did not do.

705
00:43:27,673 --> 00:43:29,607
Maybe you can.

706

[Door closes]

Bring our soldiers home!

709

Testing.

711
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:55,332
The response? North Korea has
broken off negotiations...

712
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:59,436
The dark cloud that seems to be
hanging over this administration...

713
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:00,971
By an incredible
turn of events,

714
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,841
the FBI has not been able
to interview the first son,

715
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:06,110
now said to have been
in the white house

716
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:07,745
at the time
of the murder.

717
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:09,346
Get Neil out!

718
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:10,849
Bring our soldiers home!

719
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:22,059
I have this to add to
the Carla town effects.

720
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,994
Could you open it,
please?

721

00:58:48,826 --> 00:58:50,126
You were with her
that night.

904
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,427
You had sex with her,
and then you offed her.

905
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:52,762
Oh, Jesus.

906
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:54,163
You think
it was an accident

907
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,332
she was murdered an hour
after I slept with her?

908
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,835
Someone knew I'd be there
with her that night.

909
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:01,470
Yeah, maybe somebody with
a motive as good as yours.

910
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,706
What motive?

911
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:04,708
Did your father
have sex with Carla town?

912
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:07,043
I don't know my
father's sexual resume.

913
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,845
You knew that she was
leaving town, though.

914
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:10,513
Yeah, I read
the newspapers.

915
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:11,748
2 nights in New York,

916
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:13,182
a connecting ticket
to the Virgin Islands,

917
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:14,383
and a hertz rent-a-car.

918
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,685
So?

919
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:18,288
So, Carla town didn't
have a driver's license.

920
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:22,258
You think
I killed Carla?

921
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,760
Yeah.

922
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:25,696
You think you
could prosecute me?

923
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:29,066
Your arms don't reach
that high, detective.

924
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:32,637
Still don't understand
why you showed up.

925
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:35,939
I go to sleep
every night

926
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,007
thinking about a woman
with 8 stab wounds.

927
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:41,444
A woman that I slept
with an hour before.

928
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,147
You try that
as a sleeping pill.

929
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,819
Hey, you forgot
something.

930
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:11,675
TV: In what is fast rivaling the
north Korean hostage-taking

931
01:00:11,676 --> 01:00:13,810
as an issue of concern
for the white house,

932
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:16,512
the murder of Carla town
remains unsolved.

933
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:19,282
As the attention of Washington
homicide detectives

934
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,549
turn to Kyle Neil,

935
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,552
and the president's approval
ratings continue to plummet,

936
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,954
we must ask...

937
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,456
Will Carla town be
Jack Neil's chappaquiddick?

938
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,993
At this hour, no one knows
where the trail will end.

939
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:32,095
We do know
that for an administration

940
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:33,629
already knee-deep
in troubled waters

941
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,834
of a potentially international
confrontation in north Korea,

942
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:39,635
a serious domestic
concern of this nature

943
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:44,407
is especially dangerous to the
president's public image.

944
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:47,543
If Jack Neil is unable to protect
the workers under his own roof...

945
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:48,746
[click]

946
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:54,084
[Thunder]

947
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:25,181
Coffee?

948
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,283
Yeah.

949
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,989
Come on, Regis.

950
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,056
Sorry I'm late.

951
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,624
[Sighs]

952
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:10,126
What's the matter?

953
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:11,527
What is it?

954
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:12,929
They were there.

955
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,163
Who was where?

956
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,200
The president
and the first lady.

957
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,668
They weren't at camp David
when Carla was murdered.

958
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,037
They were in
the white house!

959
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:22,405
How do you know this?

960
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,874
That morning, I almost
shot their golden retriever.

961
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,611
They never go anywhere
without that dog.

962
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:32,281
Tonight, I saw footage of them coming
back from camp David with the dog.

963
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:35,051
Their alibi
is complete bullshit.

964
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:36,786
So, that means they
took them to camp David

965
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,287
after the body
was discovered.

966
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:40,056
Nina: Yeah.

967
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:45,128
Regis: Spikings. He could
have smuggled them out.

968
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:46,429
How?

969
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,898
The tunnels underneath
the white house.

970
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:52,635
Now, hey, look, I built
this city, remember?

971
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:55,171
I just can't
believe this.

972
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,273
They covered it up,
and they got them out?

973
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,341
Why?

974
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:00,076
Because then they'd
be considered suspects

975
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:02,012
just like
everybody else.

976
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,481
Why should they be,
though?

977
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:06,782
That's the question.

978
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,518
Nina: Because he's the president
of the United States.

979
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,920
Regis:
What does that mean?

980
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:12,355
That he doesn't
have a motive?

981
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:14,557
He has a mistress about
to drop a tell-all.

982
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:15,925
That's
motive enough.

983
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:18,027
The wounds are
from the left.

984
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:19,863
President Neil
is right-handed.

985
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:22,565
Yeah, I noticed that.

986
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:24,868
He writes
with his right hand,

987
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:26,269
but he swings
a baseball bat

988
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,837
and a golf club
with his left.

989
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:30,440
Jesus.

990
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:33,977
Yeah, she's still there.

991
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:35,478
Now, do you want me
to finish this?

992
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:38,014
Man: No. They're right
where we want them.

993
01:03:38,015 --> 01:03:39,816
We're right on schedule.

994
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:56,599
Thanks, Regis.
I appreciate it.

995
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,134
I can take care
of myself.

996
01:03:58,135 --> 01:04:00,803
I want you to lay low until I
get to Jordan or spikings.

997
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:02,005
Ok. Yeah.
Ok?

998
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:04,074
[Helicopter]

999
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,843
Secret service.

1000
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,979
Shit! Mmm!

1001
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,181
Back door.

1002
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:28,464
Hey!

1003
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:30,400
Move! Move!

1004
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:33,070
Get them!
Go!

1005
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:43,080
Go! Go!

1006
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:24,653
Go for the gas tank!

1007
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,390
He's clear!

1008
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,006
Come on!

1009
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:07,963
Reporter: Harlan, what
about Nina chance, huh?

1010
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,965
Detective, do you have
any more information...

1011
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,967
detective, is the
white house involved?

1012
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,437
You want the spotlight?
Become a rock star.

1013
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:17,174
I'd reassign you, but
it'd make even more news.

1014
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:19,542
[Knocking]

1015
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:21,844
Come in!

1016
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:23,912
Call for you,
detective Regis.

1017
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,248
I'm not taking
any calls.

1018
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:27,317
It's
the white house.

1019
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,420
How lovely for you.

1020
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:35,291
Jordan: That was some stunt you
pulled last night, detective.

1021
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:38,094
Last night had nothing
to do with me.

1022
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:39,295
I was off-duty.

1023
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:40,896
Why do I find that
difficult to believe?

1024
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:42,565
I don't care
what you believe.

1025
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:44,767
I want to know why the
president was in residence

1026
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:46,001
the night
of the murder,

1027
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,236
and you
didn't tell me.

1028
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:49,538
The president's
not to be involved.

1029
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:52,041
The president is about to
become an official suspect.

1030
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:53,876
Whoa.

1031
01:06:53,877 --> 01:06:54,943
Suspect?

1032
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:56,379
Look, it's my duty
to question...

1033
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,147
you're not questioning
the president.

1034
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:01,550
The presidency is an
institution, not a person.

1035
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:04,520
That institution will
be protected at all costs.

1036
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,988
Why do you think we got them
out of there that night?

1037
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:07,623
I don't know. Maybe
cover up a crime.

1038
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:10,426
No. To get the smell of blood
away from the north Koreans.

1039
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:12,895
They'd eat us alive. We'd
never get our boys back.

1040
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:15,398
This is global, detective.

1041
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:16,565
It's a little bit
off your turf.

1042
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:19,236
This is a homicide.
This is my turf.

1043
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:22,071
[Sighs]

1044
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:23,473
Let me tell you
something.

1045
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:27,843
I've known Jack Neil
for 3 decades.

1046
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:29,545
I'm godfather
to his son.

1047
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,214
Your suspicions
are ludicrous.

1048
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:33,182
Luchessi's a stooge.

1049
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:34,883
How?
Then prove it.

1050
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,486
Nobody can pinpoint the
actual time of death,

1051
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:39,622
and he can't prove his
whereabouts for an hour.

1052
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:43,793
There are 27 cameras covering the
hallways of the working white house.

1053
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:48,931
You're telling me none of them
captured her walking down a hallway

1054
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:51,066
within 3 minutes
of her death?

1055
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,571
Or are you trying
to tell me?

1056
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,807
The tapes
are classified.

1057
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,509
Out of my reach.

1058
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,612
You republican
or democrat?

1059
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:07,916
I think Washington is drowning
in a sea of its own bullshit.

1060
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,987
Those 13 men aren't risking
their lives over bullshit, pal.

1061
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:13,789
Well, this is not
about those 13 men.

1062
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:16,259
It's about a dead woman
in the white house.

1063
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,962
You know...

1064
01:08:19,963 --> 01:08:21,164
Harvard did a study.

1065
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:23,766
Said you could measure
a man's longevity

1066
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,570
by the first thing he turns
to in the morning paper.

1067
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:31,308
Well, I'm
an obituary man.

1068
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,312
Start with the comics.
You'll live longer.

1069
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:25,528
Whoever leaked this,

1070
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:28,231
I'm going to bottle
their last breath.

1071
01:09:28,232 --> 01:09:30,098
Sir, if she
was alive at 10:49,

1072
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,500
she had to be
murdered while at...

1073
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,837
this doesn't change a damn
thing about luchessi.

1074
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,306
Nobody saw him until 11:02.

1075
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:42,044
That still gave him
13 minutes to do the job.

1076
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:44,248
[Telephones ringing]

1077
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:51,019
[Sighs]

1078
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,156
Regis... What are you
going to do?

1079
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:56,260
Put the president
in a lineup?

1080
01:09:59,263 --> 01:10:01,196
Ok. You're Carla town.

1081
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,532
You're about to sell this story
for a shitload of money.

1082
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,000
You're going
to move to paradise.

1083
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:07,671
You buy a one-way ticket,
never to return, right?

1084
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:12,908
Tape: This is sears
calling for Carla town,

1085
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,710
confirming Monday
between 8:00 and 12:00

1086
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:17,680
to install the trash compactor
you bought yesterday.

1087
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:19,815
Why the hell would you
have a trash compactor

1088
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:21,950
installed 2 days
after you're gone?

1089
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,086
Maybe she forgot?

1090
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:26,589
She just bought it
the day before.

1091
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,223
What?

1092
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,625
Shit!

1093
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:32,629
Monday, 4:30.
You're right.

1094
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:47,943
What have you got?

1095
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:50,714
Wait a minute...

1096
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,656
And the handwriting
on the 23rd?

1097
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:02,725
The slope of the writing
is different.

1098
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:03,759
Here.

1099
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,795
Look at this.

1100
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:09,398
The loop on the top of this
"L" is smooth and continuous.

1101
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:11,066
In the day planner,

1102
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:13,436
here, there's an obvious
pause in the writing.

1103
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,871
Mm-hmm. Which indicates
a deliberate stroke.

1104
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:17,072
Here.

1105
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:22,210
It's on the "b" as well.

1106
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:23,547
This is a forgery.

1107
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:27,983
There never
was an appointment.

1108
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:30,286
She wasn't
going anywhere.

1109
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:25,374
Spikings?

1110
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:30,746
Entered at 12:09,
left at 12:14.

1111
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:32,147
Yes?

1112
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:33,516
Yes, sir.

1113
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:35,951
Surveillance tapes.

1114
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:37,019
Well, he had clearance.

1115
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,688
Thank you.

1116
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:40,690
Bob?

[Door opens]

1118
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:45,962
Yes, sir?

1119
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:50,599
I want to talk to detective Regis, D.C.
homicide.

1120
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,501
He's going to want to
question Nick spikings.

1121
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:54,837
Get me spikings'
address in Alexandria.

1122
01:12:54,838 --> 01:12:55,839
Bob: Yes, sir.

1123
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:15,257
Somebody's been playing
us like puppets.

1124
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:16,792
What are you saying?

1125
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:20,729
Carla town wasn't killed to
protect the administration.

1126
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,631
She was murdered
to destroy it.

1127
01:13:22,632 --> 01:13:24,332
What do you mean?

1128
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,935
I'm saying that somebody dumped
the dead body in the white house

1129
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:29,572
so that the blood trail could
lead right to the first family.

1130
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:31,908
They even manufactured
the motive.

1131
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:45,489
[Knock on door]

1132
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,493
[Sighs]

1133
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:54,963
So?

1134
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:58,734
Spikings: Only the guard
knew I took the tapes.

1135
01:13:58,735 --> 01:14:01,236
That means you've got
someone on the inside.

1136
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:04,573
Regis: It's time you and I
stopped playing games.

1137
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:06,710
Sit down.

1138
01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:32,801
You have any idea what it takes
to stand all day in one place

1139
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:35,471
watching a dumpster
in the pouring rain?

1140
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,575
Because that dumpster just
happens to be next to a hotel

1141
01:14:39,576 --> 01:14:42,679
where the president is going to
be staying the following day?

1142
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,750
And his life
is in your hands.

1143
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:52,756
Loneliest job
in the world.

1144
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:01,931
Get rid of the wire.

1145
01:15:01,932 --> 01:15:03,800
I know who's
listening anyway.

1148
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,323
Think you got it all
figured out, huh?

[Chuckles]

1150
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:34,530
You haven't read me
right at all.

1151
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,912
I see my life
and my service

1152
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:54,083
with a clarity
you're incapable...

1153
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:17,140
shit.

1155
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:14,363

Aah!

1157
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:46,128
Shit!

1158
01:17:46,129 --> 01:17:47,130
Cover me!

1159
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,079
Go!

1160
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:06,414
Thought you were
a sharpshooter.

1161
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:07,416
Save it.

1162
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:14,156
Freeze China out if they
stand with north Korea.

1163
01:18:14,157 --> 01:18:16,558
All talks for
a grain deal cease

1164
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,260
until they stand down.

1165
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:21,330
If China wants grain,
I want our boys back.

1166
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:24,967
You got 5 minutes, al.

1167
01:18:24,968 --> 01:18:28,171
I'm afraid it's going
to take longer than that.

1168
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,809
It's bad news,
Mr. president.

1169
01:18:34,978 --> 01:18:36,711
It's still Jack, Alvin.

1170
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,748
Nick spikings is dead.

1171
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,050
What?

1172
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:46,956
And he had evidence that
Kyle killed Carla town.

1173
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,926
Spikings collected it.

1174
01:18:51,027 --> 01:18:54,162
They found a condom
with Kyle's semen

1175
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:55,898
and the woman's
fingerprints on it.

1176
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:59,102
They found
the murder weapon.

1177
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:04,907
And a surveillance tape putting
Kyle and the woman together

1178
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:08,643
just minutes
before the murder.

1179
01:19:08,644 --> 01:19:11,479
There's got to be
another explanation.

1180
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,248
No, no.

1181
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:18,220
And spikings was just about to
cut himself a deal to leak it.

1182
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:19,923
Nick spikings?

1183
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,624
He wouldn't
do that to me.

1184
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,293
Everybody
has a price.

1185
01:19:27,663 --> 01:19:28,831
Not the first thing
in your life

1186
01:19:28,832 --> 01:19:31,067
you've been naive
about, is it, Jack?

1187
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,103
Obviously not.

1188
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:37,974
Well, you're safe now.

1189
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:41,177
So's Kyle.

1190
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,258
Spikings...

1191
01:19:56,259 --> 01:19:57,526
Was murdered.

1192
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:18,713
Man on TV: Just get a bucket
and start getting the water

1193
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:20,582
out of the boat,
you guys.

1194
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:23,519
Second man: Mayday, this is the
ketch Rene off Turner point...

1195
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,090
let's see what we got.

1196
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:32,295
Jordan.

1197
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:38,700
21:18. That's 9:18.

1198
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:40,970
All right,
he goes out there.

1199
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:45,373
Hey, we got a special on
that model this week, folks.

1200
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:46,474
4 heads, 21...

1201
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:47,775
back off.

1202
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,644
Sure. Only a couple left,
though.

1203
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:51,114
Just so you know.

1204
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:55,417
Regis: 20:16.

1205
01:20:55,418 --> 01:20:58,087
8:16, he comes in.

1206
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:06,261
I can even throw in a universal
remote with that, you know?

1207
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:07,163
Back off!

1208
01:21:07,164 --> 01:21:08,796
Sure, sure, take your time.

1209
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:11,000
Just, uh, ask for Jack.

1210
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:15,537
He comes in, and yet
he leaves... wait.

1211
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:16,539
Who's that?

1212
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,077
I know that guy.

1213
01:21:25,781 --> 01:21:29,584
That's the guy
that was at spikings'.

1214
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,219
The 31st name.

1215
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,289
Jordan walked him in.

1216
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:37,160
Jordan set up
the whole thing.

1217
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:39,527
Yeah.

1218
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:42,230
Newscaster: The investigation
into the white house murder

1219
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:43,999
has resulted in 2 suspects.

1220
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,668
The car, a burgundy
Chevrolet caprice,

1221
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:49,804
has been identified as
the possible suspect car.

1222
01:21:49,805 --> 01:21:51,373
In other news,

1223
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:55,211
a strike is pending as
workers' contract talks...

1224
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:59,414
There won't be anything
anyone can prove.

1225
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:02,218
All the evidence
will be destroyed.

1226
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:08,424
What do you want?

1227
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:14,563
Your resignation.

1228
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:18,067
Effective 10 P.M.

1229
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:23,338
I don't know why you
look surprised, Jack.

1230
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:25,907
Tully wasn't half-right
when he called it criminal.

1231
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:28,376
Because we didn't go in
with guns blazing?

1232
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:29,777
You think that would've
saved our boys?

1233
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,981
You have failed,
Mr. president!

1234
01:22:33,549 --> 01:22:36,418
You have failed your
office pitifully.

1235
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:38,286
I've seen your
cowardice grow

1236
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:39,887
from the very
beginning.

1237
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,256
And then, finally,

1238
01:22:41,257 --> 01:22:42,991
not having served your
country in the military,

1239
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:47,129
you had no idea of
the time-honored code

1240
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:50,699
of never leaving a man
on the field of battle.

1241
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:57,039
You should've brought
those awacs boys home

1242
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,042
dead, wounded,
or otherwise.

1243
01:23:00,043 --> 01:23:03,646
You should've done it
by force if necessary.

1244
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,315
Any president who
serves up his country

1245
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:09,317
as appetizers
for the enemy

1246
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:12,088
isn't fit for this office.

1247
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:18,926
So the choice is yours.

1248
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:20,928
You can... you can resign.

1249
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,730
Say it's due to your health.

1250
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:25,333
And you can tour the best
golf clubs in America.

1251
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,935
Or you can stay
in office,

1252
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:31,140
and you can watch
your son destroyed.

1253
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:34,342
The choice is yours.

1254
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:38,547
I mean, if any father
can call that a choice.

1255
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:47,355
Why didn't he just
kill Neil?

1256
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,157
Because it's easier
to kill the secretary

1257
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:50,592
than it is
the president.

1258
01:23:50,593 --> 01:23:53,928
Besides, alive
and ruined is better.

1259
01:23:53,929 --> 01:23:55,097
Than what?

1260
01:23:55,098 --> 01:23:56,564

this special bulletin.

01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:02,237
An oval office address is
scheduled for 10:00 tonight.

1263
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:05,039
Unidentified sources say
the president will resign.

1264
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,308
Jordan played his card.

1265
01:24:06,309 --> 01:24:08,276
Newscaster: In related news,
all federal...

1266
01:24:08,277 --> 01:24:10,778
all right,
that gives us 2 hours

1267
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,582
to get to the white house
and the president.

1268
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,451
Are you insane?

1269
01:24:16,452 --> 01:24:18,220
How?

1270
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:21,256
We'll use the tunnels
the same way they got out.

You don't even know
where they are.

Yeah, but you do.

1273

the security,

1274
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,597
and you know the layout.

1275
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,566
You're out of your mind.

1276
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:34,569
Why, because I'm about
to help a government

1277
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,239
that's kicking me out
on the streets?

1278
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,608
You got no argument there.

1279
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:49,852

of this car.

1284

that homicide 2 weeks ago?

That's the steam grate.

1291
01:25:38,534 --> 01:25:40,535
It'll take us to one of 3
points that are vulnerable

1292
01:25:40,536 --> 01:25:42,103
to penetration in
the white house.

1293
01:25:42,104 --> 01:25:45,640
Eisenhower put a water filtering
system down in there.

1294
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:47,675
There's got to be
an alarm.

1295
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:48,611
Yeah, there is.

no secret service.

Regis:
Response time?

1300
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,220
Well, officially
5-7 minutes.

1301
01:25:58,221 --> 01:26:01,088
But realistically 10 or 11.

1302
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:03,458
By that time
we'll either be fired,

1303
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:05,460
or we're going to be dead.

1304
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:07,462

during that.

Could be this thing with
the president maybe, huh?

1316

over us.

lay the wood

[Whistling]

1432
01:38:16,691 --> 01:38:18,292
Not now.

1433
01:38:18,293 --> 01:38:19,494
Hold it.

1434
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:24,166
Let me see some I.D.

1435
01:38:26,568 --> 01:38:28,035
Agent, gun!

1436
01:38:28,036 --> 01:38:29,870
The janitor!
Jordan.

1437
01:38:29,871 --> 01:38:31,906
Agent: Get down!
Get down!

1438
01:38:36,278 --> 01:38:39,080
Get him!
He killed spikings!

1439
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:40,581
Mr. president!

1440
01:38:40,582 --> 01:38:41,748
Your son is innocent!

1441
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:43,850
Sir, you can't
be here.

1442
01:38:43,851 --> 01:38:44,851
I am here.

1443
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:46,120
Seal the corridor.

1444
01:38:46,121 --> 01:38:48,589
I am still the president!

1445
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:50,625
Seal the corridor!

1446
01:38:53,361 --> 01:38:54,996
Alvin Jordan,
you're under arrest

1447
01:38:54,997 --> 01:38:57,531
for conspiracy in
the murder of Carla town

1448
01:38:57,532 --> 01:38:59,066
and Nicholas spikings.

1449
01:38:59,067 --> 01:39:00,467
You have the right
to remain silent.

1450
01:39:00,468 --> 01:39:02,203
Anything you say can
and will be held against you

1451
01:39:02,204 --> 01:39:03,837
in a court of law.

1452
01:39:03,838 --> 01:39:05,206
You have the right
to an attorney.

1453
01:39:05,207 --> 01:39:07,008
If you can't afford one,
you prick,

1454
01:39:07,009 --> 01:39:10,212
one will be appointed
by the courts.

1455
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:18,419
How did you get in here?

1456
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:19,753
I crawled.

1457
01:39:19,754 --> 01:39:22,856
He's the one who gave spikings
the evidence on your son.

1458
01:39:22,857 --> 01:39:24,691
Regis: The evidence
is you on tape

1459
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:26,960
with the man you walked
in to kill Carla town.

1460
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:30,497
The same man who put a bullet
through Nicholas spikings.

1461
01:39:30,498 --> 01:39:31,898
Stand him up.

1462
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:33,900
You don't have
to believe me.

1463
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:35,469
Just look at the tape.

1464
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:36,637
It's in my back.

1465
01:39:36,638 --> 01:39:37,605
Agent?

1466
01:39:37,606 --> 01:39:39,506
Mr. president, Carla
town was killed

1467
01:39:39,507 --> 01:39:40,442
to destroy you.

1468
01:39:40,443 --> 01:39:42,309
To force your
resignation.

1469
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,311
Then Jordan had
spikings shot

1470
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:46,214
because
he saw the tape.

1471
01:40:01,129 --> 01:40:02,329
Arrest him.

1472
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:04,398
What?

1473
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:05,766
Not him.

1474
01:40:05,767 --> 01:40:07,269
Him.

1475
01:40:17,879 --> 01:40:19,280
My god, Alvin.

1476
01:40:19,281 --> 01:40:22,283
You really had her killed,
didn't you?

1477
01:40:22,284 --> 01:40:25,319
I think president Teddy
Roosevelt said it best.

1478
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:29,823
If I must choose between
righteousness and peace,

1479
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:33,128
I choose righteousness.

1480
01:40:35,097 --> 01:40:37,564
She was 25 years old.

1481
01:40:37,565 --> 01:40:39,032
She was a child.

1482
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:41,569
She was a casualty of war.

1483
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:46,574
Mr. president.

1484
01:40:51,346 --> 01:40:53,481
Get him out of here.

1485
01:40:56,851 --> 01:40:59,053
Thank you, son.

1486
01:41:01,789 --> 01:41:03,325
Gun!

1487
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:15,602
Nina, just stay easy.

1488
01:41:15,603 --> 01:41:17,003
Stay easy.

1489
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:19,873
Just stay easy.
I'm right here.

1490
01:41:19,874 --> 01:41:21,843
All right, hold on.

1491
01:41:25,547 --> 01:41:28,749
No, there's absolutely
no truth whatsoever

1492
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,151
to any of those rumors.

1493
01:41:30,152 --> 01:41:33,154
At no time was
president Neil planning

1494
01:41:33,155 --> 01:41:35,189
on resigning from office.

1495
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:37,057
Here's what we know so far.

1496
01:41:37,058 --> 01:41:40,327
The murderer of Carla town
is dead.

1497
01:41:40,328 --> 01:41:41,762
He was killed today

1498
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:44,865
as he fired upon authorities
attempting to arrest him.

1499
01:41:44,866 --> 01:41:48,402
In that same gun battle,

1500
01:41:48,403 --> 01:41:51,672
national security advisor
Alvin Jordan

1501
01:41:51,673 --> 01:41:55,909
and senior secret service
agent Nicholas spikings

1502
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:57,512
were also killed.

1503
01:42:00,315 --> 01:42:03,317
Did the killer actually
penetrate the white house

1504
01:42:03,318 --> 01:42:05,719
with the objective
of killing miss town?

1505
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:06,987
In 180 years,

1506
01:42:06,988 --> 01:42:09,055
there has never been a
penetration of the white house.

1507
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:12,293
President and Mrs. Neil will
have a statement for you later.

1508
01:42:12,294 --> 01:42:13,394
Thank you very much.

Call D.C. homicide.

1511
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:19,300
Tell them the detective
we found in the tunnel

1512
01:42:19,301 --> 01:42:21,302
is on his way to
university hospital.

1513
01:42:21,303 --> 01:42:23,837
Paramedics say
he's going to be fine.

1514
01:42:23,838 --> 01:42:25,907
Neil: How is she?

1515
01:42:27,242 --> 01:42:28,876
She's stable.

1516
01:42:30,178 --> 01:42:31,846
You saved my life.

1517
01:42:33,548 --> 01:42:36,351
Thank you.

1518
01:42:38,786 --> 01:42:41,188
And detective,

1519
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:42,789
how can I ever repay you?

1520
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:44,391
Mmm, don't bother.

1521
01:42:44,392 --> 01:42:46,327
Just doing my job.

1522
01:42:46,328 --> 01:42:48,895
Well,
there is one thing.

1523
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:50,531
Yes, detective?

1524
01:42:50,532 --> 01:42:53,200
Have you ever heard of the
interstate commerce commission?

1525
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:54,601
Sure.

1526
01:42:54,602 --> 01:42:56,136
Secretary Randall's office
is right down the street.

1527
01:42:56,137 --> 01:42:57,538
Right down the street?

1528
01:42:57,539 --> 01:42:58,340
Yeah.

1529
01:42:58,341 --> 01:43:00,341
See? It's not
what you know,

1530

it's who you know.
