00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,528
Stieg Larsson's
The Girl Who Played With Fire

2
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:08,277
Hello. Welcome.

3
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:13,657
Come here.
Yes, like that. Much better.

4
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,493
Will you be good to me?

5
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:22,592
Will you be good to me?
Then I'll be good to you.

6
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,055
It's too late.

7
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:07,800
Solicitor Bjurman?

8
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,147
Yes?

9
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,578
This is regarding a police file
dated 1993. Lisbeth Salander.

10
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:19,675
My employer would like to take a look at it.

11
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,507
Really?
And who is your employer?

12
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,618
I have the case files stored at my retreat.

13
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:57,453
Do you have copies?
- No.

14
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:09,028
Is she still abroad?
- Yes, most likely.

15
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:27,086
Thank you.

16
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:30,852
Bjurman?

17
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,689
I will stay in touch.

18
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:37,197
You're supposed file reports about me to
the Guardianship.

19
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,293
I do.
- Each month. You're sloppy.

20
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,765
I have some reports stored at my retreat.
- Shut your mouth.

21
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,570
If your reports say I'm
behaving well,

22
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,657
I will let you go when I'm no
longer under the Guardianship.

23
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,692
If you can't do it, I'll send
our movie to every newspaper in the country.

24
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,904
If something happens to me,
or if I die, it will be made public.

25
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,711
And if you touch me again,
I'll kill you.

26
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,223
And one more thing:

27
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:08,353
If you visit that clinic in Marseille
for tattoo removal,

28
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,855
I'll redo my work.
On your forehead.

29
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,266
Do you understand?
- Yes.

30
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,762
Is this Zala?

31
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,567
Nils Bjurman.

32
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:40,530
you're interested the police file on
Lisbeth Salander.

33
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,658
I have it
in a safe place.

34
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:48,799
I'll let you have it, but only if you
take care of Salander first,

35
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,095
She has a DVD
which belongs to me,

36
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,453
When I have it,
you'll have the file,

37
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,602
She's back in Sweden,
and probably not difficult to find,

38
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,211
- Do you still see her?
- Who?

39
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,861
Lisbeth Salander.
- I haven't seen her in a year.

40
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,896
Why is that?
- I don't know.

41
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:27,359
One day we'll talk.
The next day she won't answer the phone.

42
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,281
We must go now. Dag Svensson
will show up at the editorial meeting today.

43
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,180
Dag who?
- He writes about human trafficking.

44
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,912
The girls from eastern europe.

45
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,657
What kind of guy is he?
- Freelance. Young and bold.

46
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:48,328
Fit.
- Fit?

47
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:53,050
For how long have you been working on it?
- About four years.

48
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:58,420
I found the subject through my girlfriend. She's
researching gender and is a criminologist.

49
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,977
She's pursuing a PhD.
in human trafficking.

50
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,208
So you work as a team?

51
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,503
No, Mia focuses on the
girls.

52
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,101
I focus more on distributors
and the span of customers.

53
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,290
And what have you found?

54
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,805
I have found
several prominent customers.

55
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,641
Amongst them
someone from the Justice Department,

56
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,727
who participated in
shaping the new sex market legislation.

57
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,531
Three police men,

58
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,879
one from vice,
one from SEK.

59
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,247
Five solicitors
one judge and one prosecutor

60
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,582
The affected girls -

61
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,679
are so low on the social ladder
they're irrelevant to the justice system.

62
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,164
Crimes against young eastern european
girls is not a priority.

63
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,124
A whore is a whore.
That

64
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,398
... is a part of the system.

65
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:53,372
How far have you progressed?
- I've completed the research.

66
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,636
What's missing is checking the facts...

67
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,722
and confronting the customers I want
to expose.

68
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,818
Hang on.

69
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,644
The last time I didn't check my facts properly,
I spent three months behind bars.

70
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,043
Everybody will get their
chance to comment on the allegations.

71
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,703
There is no need for you to worry.
The documentation is water proof.

72
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,326
That sounds reassuring.
- Yes.

73
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,734
Okay...
We don't pay any huge salary.

74
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,092
I suggest
a two month project position.

75
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,908
You can have a desk there.

76
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,476
Does it sound good?
- Yes, excellent.

77
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:50,887
We're poking our heads out with this
case. We have to realize that.

78
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,789
That is supposedly the whole point of
of Millennium?

79
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,450
That's why we're sitting here.
- Yes, welcome to Millennium.

80
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,412
Thanks.

81
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,409
Sandstrom?

82
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,269
Sandstrom?

83
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,893
We have a job for you.
- I don't think...

84
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,781
Yes, we do, actually.

85
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,474
Hello, Armanskij.

86
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,680
May I come in?

87
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,706
More than a year.

88
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,019
What do you want?
Do you need a job?

89
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,733
Do you work some place else?

90
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,074
I have been travelling.
I just recently returned to Sweden.

91
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,902
Where have you been?
- Here and there.

92
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,948
Australia, New Zealand.
The last few months in the Caribbean.

93
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,529
I don't know why
I didn't say goodbye.

94
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,293
Because you don't really
care about other people.

95
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,903
You treat people trying to be your
friends like shit.

96
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,594
It's that simple.

97
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,968
Blomkvist has been looking for you.

98
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:51,371
He's called at least once
a month to inquire about you.

99
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:56,209
He cares as well.
Just like Holger Palmgren.

100
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,398
It has been two years since he had a stroke,

101
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,173
and you haven't even visited him.

102
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,445
Is he alive?

103
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,200
You don't even know
if he's dead or alive.

104
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,760
You've been missing.

105
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,317
I've been travelling.
I had to run away for a while.

106
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,174
Have you been worried?

107
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,980
No. You can do anything.

108
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,183
That's how it is.

109
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,567
How are things with
the new...

110
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,041
...guardian?

111
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,127
Bjurman.

112
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,276
He's okay.
It's okay.

113
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,936
And you're still forced to be
under the supervision of a guardian?

114
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,949
Don't worry about me.

115
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,453
I'll fix it.
It's no longer your job.

116
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,195
No, I'm too old.

117
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,563
I'm just a silly,
old fool.

118
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,700
Yes, you are.

119
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,058
Truly silly,
if that's what you think.

120
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,768
I thought you were dead or something.
- Or something.

121
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,511
We didn't meet that often
before you left.

122
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,224
I was busy.
- It's good to have you back.

123
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,384
I only know one person
who dares knock on the door -

124
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,605
after one and a half years of silence
to ask if I want to fuck.

125
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:18,247
...then I broke up with her and
went to Paris. Mom and dad lives there.

126
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,958
I worked in a club
near Clichy.

127
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,669
A fantastic place.

128
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,203
But I had applied for law school,
and been accepted.

129
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,541
Mom found the letter and told...
- Do you want my apartment?

130
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,223
What?
- Do you want my apartment?

131
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,550
Are you moving?
- I have already moved.

132
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:44,043
I can't afford buying anything.

133
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,714
The rent has been paid for a year.
Do you want it?

134
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,595
There's just one thing.
- I assumed that much.

135
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,389
I'm still registered here.
My mail is sent here.

136
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,205
You'll take care of it.

137
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,209
I can do that.
Where do you live?

138
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:19,162
Some place else.
- Can I visit?

139
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,082
No. Not now.

140
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,930
But you'll come over to fuck me
when you feel like it?

141
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,497
I'd like that,
but it's not a part of the contract.

142
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:36,147
You're not wired properly.
Are you serious?

143
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,804
Yes.

144
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,750
Come here.

145
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,631
Damn, I have something for you.

146
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,772
There you are.
Happy birthday.

147
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:36,320
This isn't my birthday.
- It's from last year.

148
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,307
If you're going to keep smoking
that crap,

149
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,154
you might as well do it with elegance.

150
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,901
You are the only one
who gives me presents.

151
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:35,159
How are you?
- I'm good. Excellent.

152
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,187
Or just ok. I'm trying
to get a hold of one of the customers.

153
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,138
A policeman from SEK.
Gunnar Bjorck.

154
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,320
But he's nowhere to be found.
As if swallowed by the earth.

155
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,759
It's hopeless.

156
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,130
What do you have?
- A PO Box address.

157
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,861
A PO Box address?

158
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,617
Try the lottery trick.

159
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,100
What?
- The lottery trick.

160
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,947
Write to the PO Box
and tell him he's won...

161
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:18,431
...a monster cellphone with GPS
and that he's one of 20 selected -

162
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,239
to win 100,000 if he'll participate
in a market research study.

163
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,657
Is it legal?

164
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,880
It can't be illegal
to give away a phone?

165
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:32,727
Say you're from
Indigo Market Research.

166
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,750
Hi, honey.
Sorry I'm late.

167
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,777
We're hitting the press next week,
so we're fucking busy.

168
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,489
Are you the only one
working in that paper?

169
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,712
Everybody's working like animals.
I need more time than the others.

170
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:04,759
Micke has begun confronting some of the
customers.

171
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:09,013
He's so experienced
they crap their pants if he just...

172
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,757
It's finished. Printed.
Yes.

173
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,271
It's already finished?
"From Russia With Love".

174
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:22,193
"Organized crime and
human trafficking".

175
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,218
By Mia Bergman.
- That's me.

176
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,240
My girlfriend.

177
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,370
Vi have to celebrate.
- Yes.

178
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,518
Give me a kiss.

179
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:38,033
Give me a kiss.
- It's finished.

180
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:54,945
Lovely food.
Truly lovely, Annika.

181
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:59,491
Why do you tell her?
I did the cooking.

182
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,463
It's quite tasty, Annika.

183
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:07,969
Why don't you get married?
- Leave him be, aunt Angelina.

184
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,242
He doesn't want to.
- Why not?

185
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,088
He's so handsome.

186
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,916
Mikael, do you have a woman?
You must have a woman.

187
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,481
Yes, I have a woman.

188
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,205
So marry her.
- I'd love to, but she's already married.

189
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,419
Hi, am I interrupting?

190
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,329
No, I'm at my sister's and
half a platoon of her husbands family.

191
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:39,021
Sounds nice.
About the pictures...

192
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:43,785
They are on paper, and Mia
and I leave for Dalarna tomorrow.

193
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,091
I don't know if I should send
them with a messenger,

194
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:51,939
No, don't use a messenger.
I'm leaving soon.

195
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,785
I can give you a lift.

196
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,299
I'll stop by.
- Great,

197
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,217
And one more thing.

198
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:04,056
I want to run a name.
A criminal named Zala.

199
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,132
Tell him he's Anton in my
dissertation.

200
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,021
Did you hear that?
- Don't give me new material this late.

201
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,453
No, I know,
but I think it can pay off.

202
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,938
We'll talk about it later.
- Yes,

203
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,322
Two minutes.

204
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,787
Did something happen?
- It sounded like a gunshot.

205
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,112
Just now.

206
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:03,656
Dag?

207
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,204
Hello? Hello?

208
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,694
But you reported it?

209
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,583
Yes.

210
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:50,286
Did you see what happened?
- No. I found them.

211
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:56,856
It can't have been
more than ten minutes after...

212
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,755
Do you have a description?
Did you see anyone run away from the scene?

213
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,873
No.

214
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:07,669
Maybe the neighbors saw something.

215
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,985
Do you live here?

216
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:17,314
No, I was going to visit the couple
living here.

217
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,935
I'll be back.

218
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,470
Hello? Blomkvist?
We have a couple of questions.

219
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,270
You can't have that here!

220
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:23,849
The murdered couple
was a journalist and a criminologist.

221
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:28,238
They were found by another journalist.
Blomkvist from Millennium.

222
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,524
What do we know about the motive?
- Not much at this point.

223
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:34,683
The girl was about to get her PhD.
in a couple of weeks.

224
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,728
This case has the highest priority.
Assemble a task force.

225
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:42,285
Hans Faste, Jerker Holmberg.
- Sonja Modig.

226
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,646
You can pick out the team yourself.
But make it quick.

227
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:54,234
Ekstrom, prosecutors.

228
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:03,430
You described the murders
as pure executions.

229
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:07,821
Which ones on the list are capable of that?
And getting away with it?

230
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,981
We're about to publish the names of
several persons -

231
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,088
who'd prefer to stay out of the spotlight.

232
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,299
Some of them
had already been contacted by Dag.

233
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:23,388
This is speculation.
- Shouldn't we hand the list over to the police?

234
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:27,038
Yes I suppose we should.
- No.

235
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:36,327
They can have the names of some customers,
but we must never reveal our sources.

236
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:42,407
It's about the safety of those
girls Mia interviewed.

237
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,557
It can be life or death.

238
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,404
Back to the first question:
Are we printing this?

239
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:57,360
I think that's what Dag would've wanted.
- Agreed.

240
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,447
Christer?

241
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,734
Sure.

242
00:30:56,273 --> 00:31:00,297
We have received a temporary report
about the murder weapon.

243
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:05,094
It's illegal?
- No, it's perfectly legal.

244
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:09,598
It belongs to
solicitor Nils Erik Bjurman.

245
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:13,039
Acquired in 1983.
He's got an address on Gardet.

246
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,155
There you go.

247
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,732
We could also identify
two sets of fingerprints.

248
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,830
A woman born in 1981.

249
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:28,253
Arrested for assault in Gamla Stan
in 1998, when the fingerprints were taken.

250
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:33,090
Do you have a name?
- Her name is Lisbeth... Salander.

251
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,733
Lisbeth Salander
seems quite disturbed,

252
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:43,132
She's under a legal
guardian.

253
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,155
Guess who the guardian is?

254
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:50,431
Solicitor Nils Bjurman.
The owner of the murder weapon in Enskede.

255
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,580
She was already violent
in school.

256
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:57,709
Psychiatric treatment as a teen.
We think she supports herself through prostitution.

257
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,306
And documented
violent tendencies.

258
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:06,844
Do we have Salander's address?
- Lundagatan in Sodermalm.

259
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,118
Stop! Police.
Cross the street.

260
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:16,009
- Have you arrested Salander?
- No, we're waiting for backup.

261
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:20,763
- Call me.
- I'll call when we're done.

262
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:26,571
Hookers have no class
anymore.

263
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:30,491
They look more fucked up every day.
Would you pick her up?

264
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,841
There has to be a simpler way.

265
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:40,334
Why call in the storm troopers
to catch one small fish?

266
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,901
The girl is 150 cm tall
and weighs 40 kg.

267
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,448
We're in
but the apartment is empty.

268
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,627
Affirmative.

269
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,468
Faste?
- Yes?

270
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:01,617
Why did it say Salander Wu
on the door?

271
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,798
Have no idea.

272
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:31,458
Hello, this is Bjurman. Please leave
a message and I'll get back to you.

273
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,424
Hello?

274
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:56,754
Hello?

275
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:11,228
Snap one from that angle as well,
so we get it properly.

276
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,734
She's in there..

277
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,973
Thanks. My coffee craving was
about to kill me.

278
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,289
What have you found?

279
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:35,022
Bjurman, and an empty Magnum bullet box.
We're checking it for prints.

280
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,537
And copies of monthly reports on
Salander,

281
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,789
which he's been sending
to the Guardianship.

282
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:47,065
According to the reports
Salander is basically an angel.

283
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:53,603
We have turned him around.
There is something you should see.

284
00:34:56,805 --> 00:35:02,445
"I am a sadistic pig and a rapist".

285
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:08,712
What do you think?
- Not a bad motive for  murder.

286
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:22,591
LISBETH 28
SOUGHT FOR THREE MURDERS

287
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:34,967
SOUGHT FOR THREE MURDERS
IN ENSKEDE

288
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,262
HUNTED FOR THREE MURDERS

289
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,229
JOURNALIST BLOMKVIST
FOUND THE MURDER VICTIMS

290
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:09,774
This afternoon another
victim was found.

291
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:14,122
The 56 year old socially commited
solicitor was found shot...

292
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:20,045
...in his apartment. Police is investigating
if the murders are connected.

293
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:24,893
One of the victims worked for
the newspaper Millennium,

294
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:28,824
...where Blomkvist
is editor in charge.

295
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:33,652
According to Blomkvist,
Svensson was about to write about -

296
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:37,406
- IT security and hackers.

297
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:42,098
It's a great loss
for his family and collegues...

298
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,538
...and the whole journalist community.

299
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:49,595
A brutal attack
on free society.

300
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,985
Why did you tell them that?
- Because it's true.

301
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,290
One of Dag's specialties
was hacking.

302
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:02,066
We had agreed that it would
be his next case.

303
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:06,779
And I want to find a certain person
before the police does.

304
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:11,878
Lisbeth reads everything I write.
No matter where she is.

305
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:15,610
And she's quite interested in the subject.

306
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:20,011
This statement might make her
contact me.

307
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:23,702
You have no doubts?
- About what?

308
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:26,621
No.

309
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:32,388
No?
- Lisbeth has not murdered anyone.

310
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:44,963
That's Dag's phone.
- I'll get it.

311
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:57,048
Indigo Market Research.
- Good morning, my name is Gunnar Bjork.

312
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,416
I have received an interesting offer
from you.

313
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:53,761
THIS IS WHERE POLICE FOUND IRINA

314
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,234
DAG SVENSSON'S RESEARCH
COPY

315
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:11,173
- Which documents were she looking for?
- The e-mail log from Svensson.

316
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:14,166
Or his research.

317
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:17,930
Can you track her?
- No. She doesn't work ilke that.

318
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:21,174
She's got a reason to
stay hidden.

319
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:26,115
Do you think she's guilty as well?
- I'm not saying anything.

320
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,861
I know she hasn't done anything.
Not this time.

321
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,876
Why do you ask, mom?

322
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,924
The fucking police
did it. The pigs!

323
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,208
This place looks fucking awful.

324
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,202
I don't know.
She is vanished.

325
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,267
Wait, somebody is at the door.

326
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,637
Hi, Miriam.
Tony Scala, journalist.

327
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:01,786
Your girlfriend
is suspected of three murders.

328
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,802
Can you confirm that you spent time
abroad with Salander?

329
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,639
You have to talk to the media sooner
or later. I can help you.

330
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:12,776
Go to hell you
fucking pig!

331
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:23,350
A double espresso.

332
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:29,784
Why do you think Lisbeth is innocent?

333
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,642
She had no reason to kill
Dag or Mia. Especially not Mia.

334
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:37,895
Mia wanted to expose human trafficking.
Sounds like something Lisbeth could've done.

335
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:41,160
Lisbeth detests men
who hates women.

336
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:44,684
We have proof she was at
the scene of the crime.

337
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:49,418
So you found fingerprints?
- Yes, she's connected to the murder weapon.

338
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,307
That doesn't mean she
pulled the trigger.

339
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:58,021
And Bjurman? Her gardian?
- The answer lies in Svensson's research.

340
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:03,036
This is a police matter. We do not need
private detectives and their wild theories.

341
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,489
I have no theories. I'm stating
that Lisbeth did not kill Dag and Mia.

342
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,774
I want to present evidence.
I want to point out an alternative killer,

343
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,009
and write an article you and your
peers won't like, at all.

344
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:46,392
- This is Bjorck.
- Hi, this is Indigo.

345
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:51,333
- Good, did you receive the travel instructions?
- Yes, that's not a problem.

346
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:55,160
This lottery and the cellphone...

347
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:58,696
You're still one of the
20 selected.

348
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,662
- Have we met before?
- No.

349
00:42:07,183 --> 00:42:08,934
You seem familiar.

350
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:13,335
Maybe you've seen me in the paper.

351
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:18,434
What was your name again?
- Mikael Blomkvist. Journalist.

352
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,572
I work for Millennium.

353
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:25,200
I didn't know
you do market research.

354
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:28,976
Sure, sometimes.

355
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,471
Look at these three pictures
and tell me,

356
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:38,444
which model you
prefer.

357
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:43,292
First off, this is Lidia Kamarova.

358
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:48,255
She is 16 years old
and from Minsk in Belarus.

359
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,823
Then we have Myang So Hun.

360
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:56,920
She is 25 years old, a little older,
but it doesn't show.

361
00:42:57,618 --> 00:43:00,581
She's also called Jo-Jo.
She's from Thailand.

362
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:07,889
And then we have Silvia,
her real name is Jelena Barasova.

363
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,581
She's 19 years old and from Tallinn.

364
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,210
You have paid for sex
from all these women.

365
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:20,288
So what I want to know is
which one is your favorite.

366
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,804
Is this a joke?
- No.

367
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,830
Our journalist Dag Svensson had
documentation proving...

368
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:34,843
you paid them for sex.

369
00:43:35,355 --> 00:43:37,659
Did he contact you?
- Who?

370
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,975
Dag Svensson.
- I never heard the name.

371
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:46,511
Now I want you to leave.
- Yes, that might be so.

372
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:50,307
He did not manage to confront you with the
documentation...

373
00:43:50,954 --> 00:43:53,330
before someone shot him.

374
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:56,845
Do you know solicitor Bjurman,
who was also shot and killed?

375
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:59,337
What do you want?

376
00:43:59,796 --> 00:44:04,082
I want to allow the sex buyers to
comment on the facts...

377
00:44:04,894 --> 00:44:08,262
in our next theme issue on
human trafficking.

378
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:19,952
You do understand that you will ruin my life
if you print this?

379
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:22,599
Yes.

380
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:40,243
Several visits with Irina
Check Anton = Zala

381
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:37,799
Come on. Get up.

382
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:41,179
Get up.

383
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:48,602
I'm going to ask you some questions,
Per Ake. If you answer, I'll let you live.

384
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:53,545
If you refuse, I'll zap you again.
100,000 volts.

385
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:57,966
If you lie or answer
confusingly, I'll zap you.

386
00:45:59,258 --> 00:46:02,408
Your muscles will stop working,
and you'll hang yourself.

387
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:05,911
And I'm leaving.
Understand?

388
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,783
I don't want to die.

389
00:46:13,272 --> 00:46:16,673
My mistake. I forgot to tell you that
you can't speak without my permission.

390
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:31,625
Is this your daughter?
- Yes. She'll be here any minute...

391
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:34,378
You'er breaking the rules again.

392
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,966
Do you want to die?
- No.

393
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:52,937
In january you visited Irini
in an apartment in Norsborg. Why?

394
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:59,163
I don't know...
I wanted her. She was beautiful.

395
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:02,863
Beautiful?
- Yes, she was beautiful.

396
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:06,690
And that gave you the right
to tie her up and fuck her?

397
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:19,798
You are a sadistic pig and a rapist.

398
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:23,208
Isn't that so?

399
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:39,182
Who is Zala?

400
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,821
I don't know.
- Don't abuse your chance.

401
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:48,327
I don't know who he is.
The journalist you shot asked about him as well.

402
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:51,641
If I knew
I would tell you.

403
00:47:52,204 --> 00:47:54,802
I only spoke to some who said
his name was Zala.

404
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:58,232
One minute on the phone.
- Why?

405
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:02,131
I was supposed to import a car
with amphetamine from Tallinn.

406
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,405
I didn't want to.

407
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:09,493
They showed up a few days later
and told me I couldn't pull out.

408
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:12,840
Then they forced me
to come with them to...

409
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:17,700
To?
- Some storage facility.

410
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:22,559
The first thing I saw was a man
on the floor, beaten to a pulp.

411
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:26,751
And he was there...
- Who? Zala?

412
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:31,306
No, a blond fucker.
Pure muscle.

413
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,967
I've only seen him once before.
Damn.

414
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:38,220
What's his name?
- I don't know.

415
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:42,557
What else happened?

416
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:46,050
They said the guy on the floor was a snitch.

417
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:50,775
The blonde raised him up
on a chair in front of me.

418
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:55,476
Then he put his hands around
his neck.

419
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,648
I heard his neck cracking.

420
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,551
He died
before my eyes.

421
00:49:11,075 --> 00:49:15,070
Then the blonde wrapped his
hands around my neck.

422
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:21,774
Magge held a phone to my ear
and told me Zala wanted to speak to me.

423
00:49:22,713 --> 00:49:25,308
What did he say?
Zala?

424
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:32,232
I was to do as I was told.
What choice did I have?

425
00:49:34,932 --> 00:49:36,434
Hello.

426
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,165
We have to get back.
I have a lunch meeting.

427
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:46,441
Have you been in contact with her?

428
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,779
Who?

429
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:54,783
Who do you think?

430
00:50:56,847 --> 00:51:00,914
An old friend called
this morning.

431
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:05,606
He's also convinced
Lisbeth Salander is innocent.

432
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:08,776
Who?
- That's completely skewed.

433
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:12,458
Erika?

434
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:18,004
It's best if you meet and
discuss it yourselves.

435
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:24,386
Jab, Paolo! Come on!
Give him a jab!

436
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:31,497
Move your feet, man.
Concentrate on your foot work. Come on!

437
00:51:32,216 --> 00:51:34,011
Don't give up.

438
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,265
From where do you know Lisbeth?

439
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:41,028
We've boxed together since
she was 17.

440
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:46,397
Not in the same weight class.
- She's quite tough.

441
00:51:51,694 --> 00:51:53,885
She's in trouble, yes?

442
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:11,110
She's in deep deep trouble.
Paolo, you have to help me.

443
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:15,468
I need to get in touch with Lisbeth's
girlfriend, Miriam Wu.

444
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:19,503
Have you read about her?
- I know her. Kick boxer.

445
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:23,623
She refuses to talk to me because I'm
a journalist.

446
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:27,679
If you, as a known boxer,
talk to her...

447
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:31,536
And try to reach Lisbeth
through her?

448
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,203
Fuck...!
Come on!

449
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:32,490
Micke? You asked me to dig into
Gunnar Bjorck's past.

450
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:35,609
I ran into Nils Bjurman.

451
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:39,592
He was an officer in the security
department of the national police force.

452
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,460
What? When was that?
- From 76 until 78.

453
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:50,468
Same time as Bjorck.
- Fuck...!

454
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:38,086
Where is she?
- Who?

455
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:41,567
Lisbeth Salander.
- I told you, I don't know!

456
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:44,205
Wrong answer.

457
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,068
You have one more chance.
Then I'll start using this.

458
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:05,457
Run, Miriam!

459
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:30,377
Hello?
- Micke, it's Paolo,

460
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:33,871
I'm at the hospital
with Miriam Wu.

461
01:01:34,485 --> 01:01:37,082
What?
- Would be nice if you could come by.

462
01:01:57,634 --> 01:02:01,658
I didn't shoot Dag and Mia.
If you want to help, find Zala, Lisbeth.

463
01:02:16,152 --> 01:02:18,456
I can give and receive punches,

464
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:21,991
- but he was
no ordinary human.

465
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:26,641
What did he look like?
- A blonde, armour penetrating robot.

466
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:30,593
He was pure muscle.
- And you never saw him before?

467
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,286
Never. He moved
exactly like a boxer.

468
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:38,477
He kept his guard up,
but at the same time seemed completely clueless.

469
01:02:39,175 --> 01:02:42,803
Clueless in what way? On drugs?
- No, it was very strange.

470
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:47,142
As if he had trained,
but never listened to his coach!

471
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:54,139
And then there was something
fucking scary.

472
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:59,247
I hit him rock hard.
About 100 punches went straight in.

473
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:03,711
But nothing happened.
As if he didn't feel anything.

474
01:03:06,118 --> 01:03:09,560
Hello. Ward 1B?
- Further down the hall.

475
01:03:10,249 --> 01:03:11,969
Jan Bublanski.

476
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:15,577
How are you?
- Splendid.

477
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,302
I'll find a place where
we can talk uninterrupted.

478
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:30,247
How are Miriam Wu?
- They're still examining her.

479
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,573
She looks like me.
It wasn't her they were after.

480
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:36,597
It was Lisbeth Salander.

481
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:41,989
We have identified 29 customers and pimps
from Dag's list.

482
01:03:42,865 --> 01:03:46,784
In theory, they all had a motive
to murder Dag.

483
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:52,478
Eight names are missing.
We've given them pseudonyms.

484
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:56,482
What are we doing about them?
- Malin is trying to identify them.

485
01:03:57,129 --> 01:04:00,278
Some of the pseudonyms are
mentioned in Mia's dissertation.

486
01:04:00,923 --> 01:04:05,094
We can find references there
which can lead to the names.

487
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:10,100
First I'd like to visit the
Dag wanted to expose.

488
01:04:10,892 --> 01:04:14,916
They have the most to lose.
- Then we can do the following.

489
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:20,110
Sten Falstrom, done.
He's done.

490
01:04:20,693 --> 01:04:23,551
Karl Pettersson, done.
Per Ake Sandstrom

491
01:04:24,156 --> 01:04:27,231
He's been confronted by Dag,
so we'll expose him.

492
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:30,610
And the guy from the security police force?
Bjorck?

493
01:04:31,203 --> 01:04:35,009
What about the connection between him
and Bjurman? What about this Zala?

494
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:38,712
I'm not completely finished
with Bjorck.

495
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,667
It's Bjorck.
- Blomkvist here. You never called.

496
01:04:58,314 --> 01:04:59,848
What do you want?

497
01:05:00,274 --> 01:05:03,830
You lied to me. You and Bjurman
worked together at SEPO in the 70s,

498
01:05:04,528 --> 01:05:08,450
Why would I tell you who
I worked with?

499
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,371
Tomorrow I'm holding a press conference
regarding the murders of Dag and Mia,

500
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:17,417
I will give details about
our article series on sex trade,

501
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:20,649
and you're the only customer
I'll expose.

502
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:23,777
So you'll have the opportunity

01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,593
You want to destroy my life.
Why would I talk to you?

504
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:31,588
Since you know Bjurman,
you probably know Zala as well?

505
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:34,862
Hello?

506
01:05:38,689 --> 01:05:40,920
You know who he is?

507
01:05:43,568 --> 01:05:46,426
What is that information
worth to you?

508
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:06,237
His real name is Zalachenko,
but he's called Zala.

509
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:14,527
What I'm about to tell you now is
top secret.

510
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:19,802
You understand it's important to me that
you guarantee source protection.

511
01:06:20,646 --> 01:06:22,690
I've already done that.

512
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:27,216
Zalachenko was born in 1940
in what was then the Soviet Union.

513
01:06:27,987 --> 01:06:32,711
Both parents died during the war..
I assume you know what GRU was?

514
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:36,757
Yes, the military intelligence.

515
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:41,335
He made his career in GRU.
Speaks six languages fluently.

516
01:06:42,084 --> 01:06:45,339
Expert in camouflage
and survival techniques.

517
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:48,957
Over the years he became more and more corrupt.

518
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:53,429
GRU sent a military attache...

519
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:58,133
from the embassy in Madrid
to find him...

520
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:01,010
and correct his ways.

521
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:06,765
Something went wrong
during that conversation.

522
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:12,658
Cut to the chase.

523
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:18,235
Zalachenko killed the
man from the embassy.

524
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:22,355
He realized he had burned all bridges

525
01:07:22,918 --> 01:07:25,171
went to Sweden, contacted the
security police and applied for asylum.
