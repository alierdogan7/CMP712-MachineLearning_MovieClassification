[ Thomas ] And in the end I think
it must be about faith.

1016
01:32:41,145 --> 01:32:43,670
And if faith is a choice,

1017
01:32:43,748 --> 01:32:45,682
then it can be Iost...

1018
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:48,583
for a man, an angeI...

1019
01:32:48,653 --> 01:32:51,417
or the deviI himseIf.

1020
01:32:51,489 --> 01:32:56,017
And if faith means never
compIeteIy understanding God's pIan,

1021
01:32:56,094 --> 01:33:00,258
then maybe understanding
just a part of it, our part,

1022
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:03,027
is what it is
to have a souI.

1023
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:06,002
And maybe, in the end,

1024
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:08,971
that's what being human is
after aII.
