We've known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children.

Given the stress
of the past five months,

495
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,001
his spine may have
actually shrunk.

It's uncommon, but it's within
the realm of possibility.

And circumcision?

498
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:53,350

thought it appropriate.

is hygienically sound.

But it's right for you
to raise the questions.

505

You need to be apprised of all
changes the lad went through

or not he's my son?

00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:29,983
Which means you're in no
position to be objective.

510
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:34,958

off to war and then returns

is not the same anymore.

by intuition and emotion,

689
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:49,664
On March 10th, my nine-year-old
son, Walter Collins, disappeared.

690
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,469
And a five-month investigation

691
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:55,501
led to a boy being brought to
Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.

692
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,947
They told me and all of you
that this boy was my son.

693
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:01,882
He was not my son.

694
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:03,887
The LAPD made a mistake,

695
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:07,652
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation.

696
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:10,193
I have letters from his
teachers and his doctors

697
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:12,661
all confirming that
he is not my son.

698
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,860
I'm having them reprinted now, and
I'll have them for you tomorrow.

699
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:20,392
I have given the LAPD every
opportunity to admit their mistake

700
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:22,735
and renew the
search for my son.

701
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,707
Since they have
refused to do so,

702
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:27,676
it has forced me
to bring my case public.

703
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:31,442
And I hope that this now will persuade
them to finish what they started

704
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:34,177
and bring my son home to me.

705
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:35,741
Thank you very much.

00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:53,101
I want you to find the
Collins woman and get her here.

709
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,400
And, Bill, bring her
in the back way.

710
00:44:55,473 --> 00:44:56,531
Yes, sir.

711
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:09,042
This way, miss.

712
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:11,145
Why are we going
in the back?

713
00:45:11,222 --> 00:45:13,986

jammed with reporters.

714
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:21,625
Please, sit down, miss. Captain
Jones'll be right with you.

715
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:25,999
Hey! Anyone want to take a call
from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?

716
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:27,365
What'd they do,
lose a moose?

717
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:30,669
They need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to Canada.

718
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:34,142
He's living with his cousin on some
ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.

719
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:35,269
You want it?
- I'll take it.

Mrs. Collins.

723
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:45,083
You can leave the boy.
She'll take care of him.

725
00:45:52,096 --> 00:45:54,963
Oh, you've caused us quite a
bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.

726
00:45:55,032 --> 00:45:58,058
This situation has become an embarrassment
for the entire police department.

727
00:45:58,135 --> 00:45:59,659
It wasn't my intention
to embarrass anyone.

728
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:01,204
Oh, no, of course not.

729
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:04,969
You just told the papers we couldn't
tell one boy from another as a compliment

730
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:07,237
for the months we spent
working on your case.

731
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:09,677
You trying to make fools out of
us? Is that it? You enjoy this?

732
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:11,874
Of course not.

733
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:13,177
I want you to find my son.

734
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,013
You know what your
problem is, Mrs. Collins?

735
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:17,020
You're trying to shirk your
responsibilities as a mother.

736
00:46:17,088 --> 00:46:18,248
What?

737
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:20,381
You enjoyed being a
free woman, didn't you?

738
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,517
You enjoyed not having to
worry about a young son.

739
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:25,118
You could go where you
wanted, do whatever you wanted,

740
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:26,993
see anyone you wanted.

741
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,555
But then we found your son,
and we brought him back.

742
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,863
And now he's an
inconvenience to you.

743
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:34,734
And that's why you
cooked up this scheme,

744
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:37,638
to throw him to the state and get
the state to raise him for you.

745
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,471
Isn't that true?
- That is not true!

746
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,875
No? Well, even the boy
says he's your son.

747
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:43,243
Why would he say that?

748
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:44,975
How would he know
to do that?

749
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:47,017
I don't know.
I just know he's lying.

750
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:49,450
Oh, maybe so.
Maybe he is a liar.

751
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,784
But that's how he's
been trained, isn't it?

752
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:53,721
Lying was born
in both of you.

753
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,816
You're a liar and a
troublemaker and, if you ask me,

754
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:57,884
you got no business walking
the streets of Los Angeles.

755
00:46:57,962 --> 00:46:59,020
Now wait a minute.

756
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:00,961
Because either
you know you're lying,

757
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:04,762
or you're not capable of knowing if
you're lying or telling the truth.

758
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,359
So, which is it?

759
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,331
You a derelict mother?
Or just plain nuts?

00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:26,887

son when she says it is not.

a cop is against the law?

does it make?

We haven't heard from her.

check with her neighbors.

you're depressed.

Yeah, well, this one client just
kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop,

976
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:18,552

he was a cop.

them or I'll finish you."

1206
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:02,261
And I did.

1207
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:05,794
And I killed them.

1208
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:07,096
And I did.

1209
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:08,727
I killed them.

1210
01:12:08,804 --> 01:12:10,704
Oh, God, I killed them!

1211
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,209
(SOBBING) Oh, God! Oh!

1212
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:16,468
Hey.

1213
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:17,569
Hey.

1214
01:12:17,647 --> 01:12:18,739
What?

1215
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:20,179
Look at me.

1216
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:23,116
These kids.

1217
01:12:23,586 --> 01:12:28,523
You think if you saw them again, you
think you might be able to recognize them?

1218
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:30,985
I don't know.

1219
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,220
Maybe.
