00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,534
Target bearing 0-2-0.

2
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,577
Contact!

3
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,036

00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,954
Range--20,000.

00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,039
Range--
20,000 yards.

6
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,960
Course 2-5-5 true.

7
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:25,919
Speed--13.

8
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,588
Speed--13 knots.

9
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,299
Cowboys.

10
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,788
Sailing team one,
man the 60s.

11
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,030
"Enchanter.
Mobile."

12
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,866
Well, we're a long way
from home.

13
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,494
Wake them up!

14
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,936
Enchanter...

15
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,401
Heave to,
and prepare to be boarded.

16
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,665
Enchanter, you are
a U.S. flag ship,

17
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,919
and we are going to
board you.

18
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,004
Heave to now.

19
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:45,517
Muster your crew
on the bow.

20
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,197
O.K. Hold it there.

21
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,954
Randall, come with me.

22
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,170
Stay where you are.

23
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,088
Kneel down!

24
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,842
Captain.

25
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,844
Captain?

26
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,139
Go ahead, Senior Chief.

27
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,641
It's a bad one.

28
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,851
I think you
better send over

29
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,623
Jack, come on in.

30
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,543
How high is the pile
on your desk?

31
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,378
About this high.

32
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,879
Now it's this high.

33
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,256
What have you got?

34
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,634
You heard about that business
in the South Caribbean.

35
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,594
I need the full skinny.

36
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,512
By when?

37
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,472
As soon as you can.

38
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,890
O.K.

39
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,017
Jack, be discreet.

40
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,687
What do you mean?

41
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,314
You'll find out.

42
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,401
Mysterious.

43
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,319
Oohh...

44
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,322
Ha ha ha!
I love a mystery.

45
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,619
Ryan, John P.

46
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,204
Let him through.

47
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,332
Here you go.

48
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,750
Thank you.

49
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,669
You know
where you're going?

50
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,087
Yep. Thank you.

51
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,131
Oh, where
do I park?

52
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,341
Right, uh, over there.

53
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,427
Thank you.

54
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,062
I'm in passageway,
going forward.

55
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,772
Past the stateroom.

56
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,900
Got blood on the deck.

57
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,152
19 cartridges
were recovered,

58
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,112
as well as the, uh...

59
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,908
as the two weapons
that fired them.

60
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,284
And blood samples taken

61
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,704
consistent with
the crew--

62
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:15,000
Hardin and his wife

63
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,586
and his son
and daughter.

64
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,803
There's some blood up there
on the mirror, too.

65
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,473
They were killed
in their staterooms,

66
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,891
apparently
as they slept.

67
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,519
Dragged topside
and thrown overboard.

68
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,188
The two men in custody
surrendered

69
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,399
after a brief attempt
to outrun the Coast Guard.

70
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,777
What do we know
about them--

71
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,070
the men in custody?

72
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,239
Half a dozen arrests

73
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,951
for drug trafficking
in Bogota, Mr. President.

74
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,370
Drugs...

75
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,998
Suspected ties
to the Cali cartel,

76
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,250
- not Medellin...

77
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,251
You all right,
James?

78
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,628
...according to DEA.

79
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,881
- Why?
- Nothing exotic, sir.

80
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,341
Straight piracy
and murder.

81
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,468
It's not
the first time.

82
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:11,515
It's the first time
it was a friend of mine.

83
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,142
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,526
What was that in there?
You all right?

85
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,944
Yeah.

86
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,280
I haven't slept
in 36 hours.

87
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,781
I make any sense?

88
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,199
What did you say?

89
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,243
Just kidding.
Good job.

90
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,997
You ought to give

91
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,415
diplomacy lessons,
Bobby.

92
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,417
I call it how I see it.
That's my job.

93
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,585
James!

94
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,254
And he's yours.

95
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,140
I promised
the American people

96
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,808
I would do something
about the drugs

97
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,894
pouring into this country.

98
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,814
We support
the Colombians' efforts

99
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,233
against the cartels
with equipment and--

100
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,651
And have accomplished
nothing!

101
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,697
We're powerless?
ls that what they think?

102
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,699
They think they can
keep doing this,

103
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,827
and there's
no response, ever.

104
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:17,497
Are you suggesting
a course of action, sir?

105
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,835
The course of action
I'd suggest

106
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:42,064
I'm, uh...not sure
where that leaves us.

107
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,236
These drug cartels
represent

108
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,154
a clear and present
danger

109
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,572
to the national
security

110
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,283
of the United States.

111
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:16,181
Ma, viene gente!

112
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,693
Cortez! Cortez!

113
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,611
?Como estas?

114
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,825
Aqui estoy.

115
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,784
Esperando.

116
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,202
?Ves? Toma.

117
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,203
Andale, pues...

118
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,706
estoy listo...

119
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:23,123
That doesn't
surprise me.

120
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:25,459
It should at least
concern you.

121
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,169
What will they do?

122
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,047
Come after me?
Arrest me?

123
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,925
You're scaring me.

124
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:38,222
for me to tell you
something important?

125
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,559
Thank you.

126
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,775
Listen, you pay me
to counsel you,

127
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,693
and I am counseling you.

128
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,905
I'm keeping you alive
with information.

129
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,782
If you disregard
my counsel

130
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,076
and keep running
your business

131
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,577
the way
you have been--

132
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,666
two things will happen--

133
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,878
I'll quit,
and you'll get killed.

134
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,182
You forgot
to tell me

135
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,642
about your
scouting trip.

136
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,602
No, I didn't.

137
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,854
You made
another contact.

138
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,230
Who is he?

139
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,107
Castro asked me
the same question

140
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,275
about my sources,

141
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,694
and I always gave him
the same answer.

142
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,612
But Castro
didn't pay you

143
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,447
what I pay you.

144
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,491
This one will cost you
nothing.

145
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,079
A woman.

146
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,248
You're
using a woman.

147
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,125
Ha ha ha!

148
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,507
It won't float!

149
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,052
John, what do you want,
toast or--

150
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,597
Waffles!

151
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,724
Anybody seen
my keys?

152
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,812
Pancakes!

153
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:09,771
Toast, please.

154
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,983
Bye, Dad!

155
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,526
Bye, pal.

156
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,195
Hello. Yes.

157
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,322
It shouldn't float.
It's a submarine.

158
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,698
It goes under water.

159
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,117
Jack.

160
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,746
Hello.

161
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,875
When?

162
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,753
I thought I had
the flu.

163
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,631
I'd still think
I had the flu

164
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,966
if they weren't
telling me otherwise.

165
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,844
Well, what are they
telling you?

166
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:46,433
Pancreatic cancer
of an aggressive nature,

167
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,560
if I heard them right.

168
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,020
Jesus.

169
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,564
Well, uh,
what does that mean?

170
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,859
I guess it means
I'm in big trouble.

171
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,238
No, I mean,
can they operate?

172
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,741
Maybe. That's what
they said--maybe--

173
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,661
but it sounds
suspiciously like no to me.

174
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,746
There's one of them now.

175
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:14,461
Hey!
I'm not dead yet.

176
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,880
But I am in
the hospital,

177
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,799
which means
that I'm not

178
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:19,800
in my office.

179
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,427
I don't know
what's going on.

180
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,971
I need you there.

181
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:24,972
Where?

182
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,850
In my office,
doing my job.

183
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,351
Oh, wait. I--

184
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,187
I hate not knowing
what's going on, Jack.

185
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,857
I wouldn't know
anything about your job.

186
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,776
You've been around.
No big mystery.

187
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,486
You've been to
the White House.

188
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,613
Once. I hated it.

189
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,866
No, you didn't.

190
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,409
Want to know
about politics

191
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,410
in Washington?

192
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,911
Four words--

193
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,664
Watch your back,
Jack.

194
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,254
Bobby!

195
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,006
You should be
the first to know.

196
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,675
Or I guess
the third or fourth.

197
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,719
I'm appointing Ryan
the Acting Deputy Director

198
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,137
of lntelligence.

199
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,389
It'll be a provisional
appointment

200
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,309
until James recovers.

201
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,311
Get him up to speed

202
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,314
on our aid program
to the Colombians.

203
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,233
He's got to talk
the Oversight Committee

204
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,110
out of another
$75 million.

205
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,405
And not make a fool
out of himself.

206
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,782
What's happening on
the Hardin murders?

207
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,201
I'm on it.

208
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,829
The President's calling
for a full-court press.

209
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:33,790
hand in hand.

210
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,919
That's great.

211
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,310
Margaret.

212
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:56,188
Why don't we leave
all his things?

213
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,023
O.K.

214
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:13,121
Ryan...
I can't believe it!

215
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,581
Not a team player,

216
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,625
is that what
you're saying?

217
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,545
Not a team player.
He's a Boy Scout.

218
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,421
A goddamn Boy Scout--

219
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,216
Believes in loyalty,
cleanliness, and knot tying.

220
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,593
So leave him
out of it.

221
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,053
He's the Deputy
Director

222
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,513
of lntelligence,
James.

223
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,349
It's going to be
a little tricky.

224
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,768
What does he
need to know?

225
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:35,727
Nothing.

226
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,646
He needs
to know nothing.

227
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,523
He's going to know
nothing.

228
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,983
I want a copy

229
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,401
of the President's
authorization

230
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,861
of this
new action

231
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,320
against
the cartels.

232
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,074
You want what?

233
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,576
You heard me.

234
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,203
He doesn't know
about it.

235
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,875
Let me explain it
to you very simply.

236
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,710
This is your deal,

237
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,461
not mine.

238
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,423
So unless I have
written authorization,

239
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,466
this thing is over
before it begins.

240
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,385
I won't be
the only one left

241
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,305
without a chair
when the music stops.

242
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,512
Reciprocity.

243
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,931
That's a clever name
for it.

244
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,807
Revenge is a very, very,

245
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,060
very dangerous
motivation.

246
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,396
Are you able to handle
this operation or not?

247
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,108
What I'm looking for
is a simple yes or no.

248
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,528
You're looking for
a political mess.

249
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,946
Yes or no?

250
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,739
Is that
what they want?

251
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,949
They want

252
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,243
what every first-term
administration wants--

253
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,911
a second term.

254
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,329
I don't imagine

255
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,374
the boys on the Hill
have approved this.

256
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,919
Senor, la cuenta,
por favor.

257
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,256
Have they?

258
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,509
Is that a no?

259
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,886
La cuenta.

260
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:37,641
Shit.

261
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,519
I want the money
in my account

262
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,730
before I move
an inch.

263
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,483
You got it.

264
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,694
- I'll need a Comsat link.
- You got it.

265
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,945
An insertion team.

266
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,406
You can have
a brigade.

267
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,824
I just need 12 men

268
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,909
who understand
discretionary warfare--

269
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,828
Special Ops people,
Spanish speaking.

270
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,830
Cutter will get
the military.

271
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,879
How are you today, sir?

272
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,380
Very well.

273
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,133
What is the purpose
of your visit?

274
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,092
Business.

275
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,720
What kind of business
are you in?

276
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,641
And how long
will you be staying?

277
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,935
A few days.

278
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,203
Hi.

279
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,923
Of course
it's a risk,

280
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,424
but what's
the alternative?

281
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,093
Zapping a retina
with 6,000 rads of cobalt?

282
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,929
That's not pretty.

283
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,096
Prettier than
a tumor

284
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,806
spreading in
the cranial sac.

285
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,266
What is her name?

286
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,935
I'm trying to eat!

287
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,523
Listen, um...hungry?

288
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,565
Starved.

289
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,235
Because we could
forget about lunch.

290
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,778
Oh, we did that
last time, remember?

291
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,780
Do I remember?

292
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,907
Do you?

293
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,825
Vaguely.

294
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,745
Maybe I should
refresh your memory.

295
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,040
Maybe you should.

296
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,041
Excuse me.

297
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,543
Your table
is ready.

298
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,920
Give it to
somebody else.

299
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:30,879
Moira?

300
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,840
I thought that was you.

301
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,799
How's Jack?

302
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,425
He's great,
just great.

303
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,302
You still with
the FBl?

304
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:38,387
In the Director's
Office.

305
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,805
Who was that?

306
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,516
My friend--
Senor Roberto Landa.

307
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,476
Doesn't he
look like Jack?

308
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,687
Oh, does he?

309
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,856
I can't quite see.

310
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,023
Only Latin.

311
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,651
A Latin Jack Ryan?
This I must see.

312
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,987
I have to go. Bye.

313
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:00,325
Well, we know
it's not piracy.

314
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,580
These guys had plane tickets,
Miami to Bogota

315
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:07,457
the morning after
the killings.

316
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,959
How's it going?

317
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,170
We're sneaking up
on a motive.

318
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,588
Dan Murray--Bureau.

319
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,964
Ralph
Williams--DEA.

320
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,382
Said anything yet?

321
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,758
Yeah. "We're
innocent."

322
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,052
Till the D.A.
offers a deal.

323
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,512
He already
has.

324
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,139
Regular
or extra crispy.

325
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,724
He was either
referring

326
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,184
to fried chicken

327
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,560
or the electric
chair.

328
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,478
What are you
picturing here?

329
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,063
A hit

330
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,982
on a respectable
American businessman

331
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,650
and his family?

332
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,237
You're assuming
he's respectable.

333
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,705
We have...

334
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,123
memos, letters,
credit card

335
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,166
statements...

336
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,543
and we got
personal income tax...

337
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,003
Article of
lncorporation.

338
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,421
Everything
you need

339
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,131
to break
his code.

340
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,591
What's this?

341
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,800
Yearbook.

342
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,886
Sweethearts,
football team.

343
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,262
Ah, you think?

344
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,680
I don't know.

345
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,391
O.K. Let's see
what we've got here.

346
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,644
No cream.

347
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,312
Wasn't any cream.

348
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,356
People are big
on birthdays.

349
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,275
Bet your ATM code
is your birthday.

350
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,193
Close.

351
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,653
In reverse?

352
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,196
Ha ha ha!

353
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,323
All right.
His birthday is...

354
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,953
It'd be too easy,
wouldn't it?

355
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,996
Let's try it
in reverse.

356
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,498
No.

357
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,999
Twice.

358
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,709
No.

359
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,127
This could
take...

360
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,087
months.

361
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,046
Months.

362
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,967
Son's in reverse.
This is for you.

363
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,301
No.

364
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:42,928
Wife's in reverse.

365
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,137
Hmm.

366
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,514
Daughter's in reverse.

367
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,392
You got to change
your ATM code.

368
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,560
No.

369
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,686
Daughter's...

370
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:51,687
No.

371
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,605
Wife...

372
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,067
Got it. Ha!

373
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,944
I got it!

374
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,280
Ha ha ha!

375
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,448
Right here.
Ha ha ha!

376
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,289
Wife's birth month,

377
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,790
daughter's day,

378
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,208
son's year,

379
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,710
not in reverse.

380
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,003
Sorry.

381
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,595
Print me up
that one, will you?

382
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,013
Yes, sir.

383
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,472
My boy.

384
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,433
And then
three years ago,

385
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:33,061
Hardin received a large infusion
of foreign investment capital,

386
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:36,440
which he invested wisely
in 20 major shopping centers.

387
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:40,360
I say wisely because
in the middle of the recession,

388
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,029
he posted record profits--

389
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,947
at least to the IRS,

390
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:47,326
who he apparently feared
more than his own partners.

391
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,661
To them--according
to stockholder statements

392
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,163
he was giving them--

393
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:54,416
the shopping centers weren't
doing nearly as well.

394
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,419
They were. He was just skimming

395
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,297
the lion's share
of the profits--$650 million--

396
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,133
and putting it in accounts
in Luxembourg, Panama,

397
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,760
and the Cayman lslands.

398
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:07,179
They killed him
for it.

399
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,639
Who?

400
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,098
His partners.

401
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,725
Who were his partners?

402
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,187
Well, it seems clear
that, uh...

403
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,855
he was
laundering money

404
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:19,024
for the Colombian
drug cartels.

405
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,359
Jesus!

406
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:25,405
I knew the man for 40 years.
We went to school together.

407
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,824
We almost went into
business together.

408
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:30,118
That would have
been good.

409
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,915
The press is going
to have a field day.

410
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,416
No one outside
this room

411
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,544
knows
anything about it.

412
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,046
They will.
They always do.

413
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,215
It'll come out.
You're right.

414
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,801
But when it does,
we'll downplay

415
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,762
your relationship
with Hardin somehow.

416
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:50,681
Hmm.

417
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,057
What?

418
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,559
What?

419
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,227
Defuse it.

420
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,271
What? You disagree?

421
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,231
No.

422
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,482
Well, actually, yes.

423
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:03,902
I would go in
the other direction.

424
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,780
If a reporter asked
if you were friends,

425
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,157
I'd say, "No.
We're good friends."

426
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,869
If they asked if you
were good friends,

427
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,745
I'd say, "We're
lifelong friends."

428
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,039
Give them
no place to go,

429
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,499
nothing to report,

430
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,042
no story.

431
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,588
I mean, there's,
uh, no sense

432
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:25,966
defusing a bomb
after it's already...

433
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,802
it's already
gone off.

434
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,828
That shit!

435
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:57,289
You see him?

436
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,082
All right.

437
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,085
Move your team
2 meters to the left.

438
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,507
That's it.

439
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,591
Stop.

440
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,885
Touch that light-colored grass.

441
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,678
Sniper at your feet.

442
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,224
There's nothing here,
Sergeant Major.

443
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:16,183
Damn!

444
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,435
He is good.

445
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,494
That was close.

446
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:38,038
How's he moving
so fast?

447
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,836
I see him.

448
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:47,047
Come in. Straight in.
Now! Run!

449
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,299
Keep coming!

450
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,678
Stop.

451
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,596
To your left.

452
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,515
To your left.

453
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,016
And stop.

454
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,102
Sniper at your feet.

455
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,981
Or what is it?

456
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,152
He had lunch here,
Sergeant Major.

457
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,864
McDonald's
Quarter Pounder,

458
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,825
with cheese.

459
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,660
Damn.

460
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,583
Damn!

461
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,168
That's four.

462
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,548
All right, you won
this one. Come on out.

463
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:34,261
Soldier, how did you get
that close to me?

464
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,388
Sniper approached
the instructor

465
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,807
by being
a sneaky bastard,

466
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,309
Sergeant Major!

467
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,436
Do you know the fine

468
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,396
for littering
in California, Chavez?

469
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,607
Yes, sir!

470
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,153
I saw you on
the sniper course.

471
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,529
You looked good.

472
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,323
Just about
finished here, Sergeant?

473
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,782
Yes, sir.

474
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,659
Looking forward
to taking leave

475
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:00,120
with that young
wife and kids?

476
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:03,040
I don't have any
wife and kids, sir.

477
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:04,833
What do you have?

478
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,252
I mean, you don't
call anybody

479
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:08,670
with great frequency,

480
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:10,422
don't write
many letters,

481
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,798
don't receive 'em.

482
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,387
Who are you, sir,
if you don't mind my asking?

483
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:18,388
Mr. Clark and I
are putting together

484
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,725
a special mission,
my team'll be a part of it.

485
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,102
You'd be gone
a couple months,

486
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,480
after which,
if you're not dead,

487
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:27,481
you'd have your choice

488
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,191
of assignments
in Special Ops.

489
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,536
Mr. President, do you
have a comment on...

490
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,079
Mr. President!

491
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,622
Mr. President.

492
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,752
That appears
to be defusing an issue

493
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,712
snowballing
into yet another scandal.

494
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:52,422
The Times
is reporting

495
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,800
you and Hardin
were good friends.

496
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,343
Is that true?

497
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:58,303
No. We weren't
good friends.

498
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,596
We were
lifelong friends.

499
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,139
I said that.

500
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:03,433
I said that.

501
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,145
I told him
to say that.

502
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:08,480
What?

503
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,315
I didn't say anything.

504
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,193
Yeah, but you're
thinking something.

505
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:14,987
No.

506
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,906
I was distracted
by how much trouble

507
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:20,742
you were having with
your ensemble today.

508
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:24,413
Well, it's not every day
you have to look trustworthy.

509
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,748
Told who to say
what, Dad?

510
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,166
It's not important.

511
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,085
I can walk myself.

512
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,545
The President?

513
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:32,796
Yeah.

514
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,132
Mom says she
makes more money

515
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,633
than the President.

516
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,051
She's probably
right.

517
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,720
Bye.

518
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,354
Thank you, Dr. Ryan,

519
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,357
for the information you've
shared with us this afternoon.

520
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:53,859
Thank you, Senator.

521
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,737
I agree we have to help
the Colombians

522
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,908
in their struggles to curtail
the drug cartels' activities,

523
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:03,577
however I'm confused.

524
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,580
How do you see
additional funds alone

525
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:10,167
advancing this program
from the utter failure it is?

526
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,628
You see what
I'm getting at.

527
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,546
No, I'm afraid
I don't.

528
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:18,342
You said this effort
would be benign on our part.

529
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,968
The finding
clearly states

530
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,929
that our assistance
is limited

531
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,389
to supply and advice
only, Senator.

532
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,100
I've also read
a similar finding

533
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,727
written 35 years ago

534
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,688
regarding a sliver of jungle
in Southeast Asia.

535
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:33,482
I'm sorry.

536
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,359
You're comparing
our request

537
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,236
for supplemental
antidrug funds

538
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,779
to Vietnam?

539
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:41,240
I'm comparing it
to every instance

540
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,533
a legislative body

541
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:46,078
renders judgment based on
less than all the facts.

542
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:52,125
I don't know
what to say to that.

543
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,794
You could assure us

544
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,672
we have been
given all the facts.

545
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,340
I thought I had.

546
00:29:58,423 --> 00:29:59,842
Assure us, then,

547
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,718
that this increase
in funds--

548
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,054
this escalation,
to use your word--

549
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,639
will not be used

550
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,307
for covert
military action.

551
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,686
I don't know how
you're getting to this.

552
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,605
Long experience,
sir.

553
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,191
No troops, then.

554
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,985
I enunciate
that clearly

555
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:20,445
because I don't want
any mistake.

556
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,699
No troops.

557
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,369
You could say I have
your word on that?

558
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,913
You could, indeed,
because you do.

559
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,840
I'm going
down to 3.

560
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,341
Roger.

561
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,263
Listen up!

562
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,223
Dog tags!

563
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:51,351
Take 'em off,
pass 'em forward.

564
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,478
Check your pockets
for anything

565
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,857
that can be used
for identification.

566
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:05,741
We're feet dry.

567
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:21,632
LZ in sight.
Get ready.

568
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,342
Good luck, boys.

569
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,302
Go get 'em.

570
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,099
Let's take her
down now.

571
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:48,450
Go! Go! Go!

572
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,661
Hey, Bob.

573
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,165
How you doing?

574
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:20,584
Good, sir.

575
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,753
Good to see you.

576
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,093
Good morning, Jack.

577
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,556
Yes, yes.

578
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,891
Coffee, bagel?

579
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,392
Coffee.
Black, please.

580
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:38,727
How is
the family?

581
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:40,521
Um, good, sir.

582
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:43,690
When do I meet
the other Dr. Ryan?

583
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,567
She's dying to
meet you, sir.

584
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,736
Good. Good.
Sit down.

585
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:49,279
Thank you.

586
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,114
Thank you.

587
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,033
So...

588
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:56,411
The cash is
still there, hmm?

589
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:57,788
Sir?

590
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,873
In Hardin's
offshore accounts.

591
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:01,416
$650 million.

592
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,210
And change.

593
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:06,255
And change. And we have
the account numbers.

594
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,714
Yes, sir.

595
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,259
Well, what are
we waiting for?

596
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:11,802
Let's get it.

597
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,387
Let's get it?

598
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:15,389
Let's turn
this thing around.

599
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,140
$650 million
and change.

600
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:19,226
It's worth
10 times that

601
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,769
in political
capital.

602
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,064
What?

603
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,693
Uh, well, um...

604
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:31,321
this connection
between Hardin

605
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,282
and the cartels
is a theory.

606
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:34,241
Theory?

607
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,659
A theory of mine.

608
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:36,660
Theory?

609
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:39,621
Well, I know
the money is there.

610
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:41,957
Who exactly Hardin
was working for,

611
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,084
I don't know
that exactly,

612
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:47,171
and we would have to
establish that

613
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:49,673
before we could
seize the money.

614
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:55,512
So go down there
and establish it.

615
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:56,972
Go where?

616
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,307
Colombia.

617
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:02,352
Who, me?

618
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,316
I leave you alone
for two weeks,

619
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:10,194
and you walk into
a big bear trap.

620
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:13,071
I don't know what
I was thinking.

621
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,531
You were thinking

622
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:16,200
about impressing
the President,

623
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:18,160
and you shouldn't
do that.

624
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:19,703
November.

625
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,164
January.

626
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:23,957
Of last year.

627
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:27,961
There's a guy down there,

628
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:29,922
Ieast there used to be--

629
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,381
Clark.

630
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:32,966
We go way back.

631
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:34,551
Good man.

632
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:37,596
You hit a brick wall,
look him up.

633
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,431
Admiral Greer.

634
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,351
Chemotherapy.

635
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:43,977
Ah, shit.

636
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,480
Here we go again.

637
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,108
How is Ritter
behaving?

638
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:52,486
Ritter? Oh,
Ritter is Ritter.

639
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,404
He's leaving
me alone.

640
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:55,906
Are you sure?

641
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,783
Watch him like a hawk.

642
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,661
 How you
feeling today, Admiral?

643
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,120
Okey-dokey.

644
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:04,998
It's just going
to take a few minutes,

645
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,793
and we'll get you
back to your room

646
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,169
and all comfortable.

647
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:12,047
Still a little bit
of nausea from yesterday?

648
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,849
Variable,
this is Knife.

649
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,018
Stand by to copy.
Over.

650
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,064
This is Knife.
Stand by to copy. Over.

651
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,691
Knife,
this is Variable.

652
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:15,527
Your signal is
five by five. Over.

653
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:19,740
Clear.

654
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:45,432
The chicken is
in the pot. Over.

655
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,143
Cook it.

656
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:49,978
Roger that.

657
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,412
Honey!

658
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,164
I'm late.

659
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:10,624
Bye.

660
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:11,875
Have
a good trip.

661
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:16,588
I'm not going to
say it.

662
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:18,090
Don't.

663
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,259
Be careful.

664
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,580
And local time is, uh...

665
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:52,457
well, actually,
it's the same as Washington.

666
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,959
It's 11:16 a.m.

667
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:57,504
There'll be a temperature
of about 69 degrees Fahrenheit.

668
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:04,803
Dr. Ryan!

669
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,598
Dr. Ryan!

670
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:16,982
DEA Special Agent
Jean Fowler.

671
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,233
Hi, Jean.

672
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:20,319
First time in Bogota, right?

673
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:21,486
Let's not stand here

674
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:23,071
and let somebody
take a shot at you.

675
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,115
Hell, you just
got here.

676
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,576
Come on, sir.
Let's go.

677
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:41,882
These two are--

678
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:43,175
They're brothers.

679
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:44,468
Brothers.

680
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:47,971
Don't do that.

681
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,389
Give Dr. Ryan

682
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:51,391
more air back here,
please.

683
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:52,476
Bulletproof.

684
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:02,194
We don't have
a picture.

685
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:04,071
Escobedo's
lntelligence Officer.

686
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:10,702
Invisible man, huh?

687
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,830
Gently, gently
with your hands.

688
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:16,959
 Luis, put
your hands together!

689
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,044
No! Your hands!

690
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:20,504
Together!

691
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:22,464
Good. Good.

692
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,383
Luis,
watch the canter!

693
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,343
Now trot.

694
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:27,719
Yes!

695
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,221
Very good!

696
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,098
Ha ha ha ha!

697
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:33,517
Press
with your legs.

698
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,060
Yes.

699
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,273
We lost
another plane.

700
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,817
Now go to
a shorter trot.

701
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,402
O.K.

702
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:47,948
Who is doing this?

703
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,409
If I had to guess?

704
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,870
That's not
what I asked you.

705
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:54,413
I can guess.

706
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:57,291
Someone has been talking
to the drug police.

707
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:58,792
Now, that's impossible.

708
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:01,128
If anyone spoke
to the police,

709
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,129
I would know.

710
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,755
Ernesto.

711
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,593
You think
one of the others

712
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:12,264
after what I did
to the American?

713
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,725
That wasn't quite
the deterrent

714
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:16,602
you thought
it would be.

715
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,687
Find out who it is.

716
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:28,447
What do you make
of this, Colonel?

717
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,658
An opportunity.

718
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:35,829
An opportunity, Sipo.

719
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,178
Good afternoon.

720
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,263
Afternoon.
Messages, please.

721
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:56,016
Dr. Ryan.

722
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,476
Clark.

723
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:58,852
I'm sorry I'm late.

724
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:00,771
I got
10 minutes.

725
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:03,065
O.K.

726
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:06,109
I'm positive
that Hardin

727
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:08,028
was tied
into the cartels.

728
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,404
It's definitely
drug money.

729
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:11,323
But you can't
prove it.

730
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:12,824
So far.

731
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:15,702
Mind if I ask you
a question?

732
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:16,995
No.

733
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:19,706
Why are you
telling me all this?

734
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,585
I've been out of the game
for a long time.

735
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,462
Oh. Well, I was told

736
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,798
you were
wired in down here,

737
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,716
that you knew
the town,

738
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,720
Who told you that?

739
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,515
Jim Greer.

740
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,602
How's he doing?

741
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:44,940
Well, he's not good.

742
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,402
It's cancer...

743
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:50,070
terminal.

744
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,533
He's a good man.

745
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:56,285
The best.

746
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,752
You a coffee drinker,
Dr. Ryan?

747
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,673
Yeah, I like coffee.

748
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:11,592
Try the Lindo brand.

749
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:12,801
Lindo.

750
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:14,887
I think
you'll like it.

751
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:21,852
Mr. President,

752
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:24,062
I've got some good news.

753
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:25,272
Good.

754
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:26,732
Hardin's partner
down here

755
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:29,610
was someone you may
have heard of--

756
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:30,903
Ernesto Escobedo.

757
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:32,321
That figures.

758
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:33,780
Now, is this
another

759
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:35,282
of your
theories, Ryan?

760
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:38,577
No. I think we can
call this one fact.

761
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,455
Escobedo, like every other
drug lord down here,

762
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:43,373
was also running
legitimate businesses,

763
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,292
and Hardin
was doing business

764
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,877
with these businesses,

765
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:47,794
importing,

766
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:49,129
among other things,
coffee,

767
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:52,007
which in and of itself
means nothing,

768
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,218
but he was
paying too much

769
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,385
for this coffee--

770
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:56,803
$6,200 a pound,

771
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:58,430
if my arithmetic
is correct.

772
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,015
Well, that's
expensive coffee.

773
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:01,600
Yes, sir.
I'd agree.

774
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:03,060
This is good news.

775
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:06,063
Um, sir...

776
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,899
I have other news
which isn't so good.

777
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:11,276
Oh, God.

778
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,863
Um...DEA here feels
that the Colombian government

779
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:17,199
would want
the seized funds...

780
00:44:20,202 --> 00:44:21,912
This is our money.

781
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:23,330
We found it.

782
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:25,832
We could try
telling them that.

783
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:27,292
Try? Tell them!

784
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,294
Or don't.
I don't care.

785
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:30,879
With all due respect--

786
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:33,215
Tell them
this is our money.

787
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:35,676
I wouldn't know
what to say.

788
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:37,719
I'm not a negotiator.

789
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:40,597
Don't you know someone
in their government?

790
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,809
I went to school with
their Attorney General.

791
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,435
Jacobs will come down.

792
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:47,229
He'll take care of it.

793
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:48,772
This is our money.

794
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:51,024
Thank--

795
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:54,027
Thank you.

796
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:58,824
I hate this job.

797
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:10,646
Uh!

798
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:14,900
Eyes up!

799
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,447
Demo team, up!

800
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:27,079
Device set!

801
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:29,456
Fire in the hole!

802
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,546
Let's go!
Move out!

803
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,676
Down! Down!

804
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:59,361
Whoever did this
is dead.

805
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:04,491
Whoever did this
to me is dead!

806
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:07,703
Do you hear me?

807
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:10,497
Are you
listening to me?

808
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:25,470
We'll go over it
on the plane again.

809
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:28,015
Mr. Jacobs,
could you sign these?

810
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,976
Moira...

811
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:32,603
why don't you

812
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:34,104
call in sick
tomorrow?

813
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:35,522
And the next day.

814
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:37,608
I won't
tell anybody.

815
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,568
Just because
you're not here

816
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:41,945
doesn't mean
there's nothing to do.

817
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,238
Your itinerary.

818
00:47:45,282 --> 00:47:47,701
You work too hard.

819
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,161
Adios.

820
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:00,422
Director Jacobs'
office.

821
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:03,550
Oh, yes. Hello.

822
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:04,968
All right.

823
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:06,428
Uh...l do have

824
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,846
a tentative
schedule.

825
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,116
Landa y Landa.

826
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,535
Roberto Landa, please.

827
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:31,245
This is Moira Wolfson.

828
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:33,205
One moment, please,
Ms. Wolfson.

829
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:35,958
I'll see
if I can find him.

830
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:38,085
He's on
the factory floor.

831
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,049
Yes.

832
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:46,301
A Moira Wolfson
is calling.

833
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:49,680
I told her you were
on the factory floor.

834
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:50,931
O.K.

835
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:52,266
Go ahead.

836
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,517
Moira.

837
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,479
Hi. You free in the next
couple of days?

838
00:48:57,521 --> 00:48:59,565
The next
couple of days?

839
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:01,066
I am.

840
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:03,402
My boss is leaving
the country.

841
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:05,237
Um...

842
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,114
can I call you
later?

843
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:11,451
O.K.

844
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,043
Good afternoon.

845
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,503
Good afternoon,
Mr. President.

846
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:24,381
Good news
in the fight against drugs.

847
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:27,176
I wish to announce
that an investigation

848
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:29,094
by the Department
of Justice

849
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,889
has identified
several bank accounts

850
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:34,683
from Luxembourg
to the Cayman lslands

851
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:37,311
used for laundering
drug money

852
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:39,688
on an unprecedented scale.

853
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,025
In cooperation with five
foreign governments,

854
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,444
we have taken
the necessary steps

855
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:47,362
to seize those funds,

856
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:50,240
which amount
to over $650 million.

857
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,075
Ah, shit.

858
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,078
Also to seize 20 real-estate
joint-venture investments

859
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,039
here in the United States,

860
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,374
which were
the primary agencies

861
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,834
in the laundering
operations.

862
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:03,378
Mr. President,

863
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:05,422
you did say
$650 million?

864
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:06,798
That's right.

865
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,926
It's $650 million
and change.

866
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,886
They're stealing
my money!

867
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:13,096
What's
our take?

868
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:14,223
I'm sorry.

869
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:15,682
What's
our take?

870
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,184
It's hard to say.

871
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:19,061
No, it isn't.

872
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:22,189
I made the money,
and you're stealing it!

873
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,566
Mr. President,
can we speak

874
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,653
with FBI Director
Jacobs about this?

875
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:32,658
Someone will die
for this.

876
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:35,077
He's personally involved
in this investigation.

877
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:38,455
He and his team
are busy at the moment.

878
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:48,966
No, no. This avenue
has to be avoided.

879
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:51,677
They'll be coming
from the airport

880
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:54,096
up Avenido Aeropuerto
EI Dorado

881
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:57,099
all the way
to Gran America.

882
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:58,559
Santa Fe's our spot.

883
00:50:58,642 --> 00:51:01,270
As much as I'd
love to be here,

884
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:02,771
I'm taking care

885
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:03,981
of some business
in Washington,

886
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,233
tying up
some loose ends.

887
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:16,618
Hello. Don't hang up!

888
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:20,622
Hello.

889
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:22,082
The machine

890
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:23,500
is still on, Moira.

891
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:25,043
Hi.

892
00:51:58,076 --> 00:51:59,661
Good to see you.

893
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:01,121
Agent Murray,
Ambassador Ferris.

894
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,581
How are you?

895
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:03,999
Ambassador.

896
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:06,919
This'll bring you
up to date.

897
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:08,462
All right.
Let's go.

898
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:23,644
So how's the food?

899
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:25,604
It's like
Mexican food.

900
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:28,607
- You'll hate it.
- I hate Mexican food.

901
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:05,769
- Hi.
- Hello.

902
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:07,187
The only thing

903
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:08,647
my secretary knows
about America

904
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,023
is what she reads
in travel brochures

905
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:11,525
and People Magazine.

906
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:12,943
How's the place?

907
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:14,653
Come inside
and find out.

908
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:23,704
It's, uh...

909
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,122
awful.

910
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:26,582
Ha ha!

911
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:27,###
Isn't it?

912
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,459
Mmm.

913
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,003
Oh.

914
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,467
Oh.

915
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:39,011
Mmm.

916
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,389
Oh.

917
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:52,733
So I take it

918
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:53,942
you shouldn't
drink the water.

919
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:56,695
They put water
in your room,

920
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:59,364
but I'd stick
with bottled stuff.

921
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:49,998
So what do you
brush your teeth with?

922
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,959
Use the bottled
water,

923
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,169
or you'll be
in the can

924
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:55,295
all the time.

925
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,888
The holdup was
a government connection?

926
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,015
That's the connection,
no doubt.

927
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:47,014
Hey! What the hell?

928
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:50,893
Oh, my God!

929
00:55:56,899 --> 00:55:58,358
Back up!
Back up!

930
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:05,657
Step on it!

931
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,367
Stay down!
Stay down!

932
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:17,794
Watch out!

933
00:56:21,298 --> 00:56:23,467
Damn it! Back up!

934
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:28,305
Let's go!
Let's go!

935
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:29,640
Take it easy.

936
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:31,600
Keep moving!
Go, Jack!

937
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:33,519
Go!

938
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:50,619
Incoming!

939
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:29,950
Dan!

940
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:41,920
Dan.

941
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:00,981
Dan.

942
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:02,274
Dan!

943
00:58:11,366 --> 00:58:13,952
We can't stay here!

944
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:18,665
The car,
is it running?

945
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:20,292
It's running!

946
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,711
The smoke will
keep us covered.

947
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:24,338
It's our only
chance.

948
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:25,756
Got him.

949
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,716
Break for
the driver's side.

950
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:29,426
Ready? Go!

951
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,771
Get in!

952
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:42,773
Go! Go!

953
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,585
Housekeeping.

954
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:57,097
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

955
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:08,358
You have a call
for Dr. Ryan.

956
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:09,818
Just a moment,
Doctor.

957
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,278
...in the streets

958
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,654
of Bogota today.

959
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:16,950
and eight wounded.

960
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:20,245
Five of the dead
are Security Personnel.

961
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,663
Cathy.

962
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,499
Don't tell me you're
in this thing.

963
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:27,377
I'm right
in the middle of it.

964
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:28,795
Honey,
Dan was killed...

965
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:31,048
Dan Murray.

966
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,635
I was 10 feet away.

967
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:37,137
There was nothing
I could do.

968
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:40,432
I'm coming home.

969
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:41,767
Thank God.

970
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,393
I love you.

971
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:50,943
I thought
his going down there

972
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,319
was a secret.

973
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:53,820
It was.

974
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:56,198
I don't get it.
What happened?

975
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,658
Nobody knows.

976
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:59,576
How stupid
are these people?

977
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,995
They believe
they can do anything.

978
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,872
You know what?
They're wrong.

979
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:05,374
Yes, sir.

980
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:06,917
They're wrong.

981
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:10,254
They've directly
challenged

982
01:01:10,337 --> 01:01:11,839
the sovereign
power

983
01:01:11,922 --> 01:01:14,216
of the United
States.

984
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:15,884
No more
sending messages.

985
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:18,762
He wants them
to get the message

986
01:01:18,846 --> 01:01:21,181
whether the phone
rings or not.

987
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:23,225
Those are his words?

988
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:25,811
Do they sound
like his words?

989
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:28,230
He can't be clear
when clarity

990
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:31,149
is exactly what
he wants to avoid.

991
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,986
What he means is
the gloves come off.

992
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:36,405
Yeah.

993
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:51,461
I'm telling you,

994
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:54,339
I had nothing
to do with it.

995
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:55,757
I didn't.

996
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:58,635
I wish I had.
They deserve it.

997
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:00,137
But it wasn't me.

998
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:01,513
Who did, then?

999
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:05,851
You know...
you have no answers.

1000
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:08,604
Is this the way
it was with Castro?

1001
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:09,897
No answers?

1002
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,733
You don't want
to hear an answer.

1003
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,318
Yes, I do.

1004
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:18,655
It was done to look
like you did it

1005
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:20,532
by one
of the others,

1006
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:21,992
as you suspected.

1007
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:24,912
It's always a friend
who hates you most.

1008
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:26,455
Give me the phone.

1009
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:33,712
Rojas.

1010
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:36,048
Did you do this thing?

1011
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,008
Did I do
this thing?

1012
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:39,468
You're calling
to ask

1013
01:02:39,551 --> 01:02:41,345
if I did this thing?

1014
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,263
You don't
consult with us.

1
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:47,079
and now you have
the arrogance

2
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,815
to want me to believe
it wasn't you?

3
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:51,304
It wasn't, Enrique.

4
01:02:51,384 --> 01:02:52,429
You've invited
the Americans

5
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,637
to retaliate

6
01:02:53,717 --> 01:02:55,085
against all of us.

7
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:56,050
I swear.

8
01:02:56,091 --> 01:02:58,383
I had nothing
to do with it.

9
01:02:58,464 --> 01:03:02,165
Why do you expect me
to listen when you're lying?

10
01:03:02,205 --> 01:03:03,612
Goodbye, Ernesto.

11
01:03:03,653 --> 01:03:05,021
No, no, no!

12
01:03:05,102 --> 01:03:07,957
Don't hang up.
We must have a meeting

13
01:03:07,998 --> 01:03:11,015
as soon as possible
to straighten this out.

14
01:03:14,232 --> 01:03:15,681
Tomorrow night.

15
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:17,612
No, I'm not
telling you.

16
01:03:17,692 --> 01:03:19,341
I am asking you!

17
01:03:19,382 --> 01:03:21,674
May we please have
a meeting tomorrow night?

18
01:03:21,755 --> 01:03:24,249
- Tomorrow afternoon.
- Thank you.

19
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:53,454
He's scared.

20
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:54,942
He should be.

21
01:03:55,023 --> 01:03:56,793
I don't know
what you said,

22
01:03:56,873 --> 01:03:58,401
but it was right.

23
01:05:28,067 --> 01:05:29,716
Strange,
don't you think?

24
01:05:29,756 --> 01:05:31,165
Jacobs
and his secretary

25
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:33,698
getting killed
on the same day.

26
01:05:35,066 --> 01:05:36,474
He wasn't
a secretary.

27
01:05:36,514 --> 01:05:37,923
He was an assistant,

28
01:05:37,962 --> 01:05:40,336
a member
of the Security Detail.

29
01:05:40,376 --> 01:05:41,784
Who?

30
01:05:41,824 --> 01:05:44,197
I don't remember
his name.

31
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:46,128
I'm talking
about Moira.

32
01:05:46,169 --> 01:05:47,859
What?

33
01:05:47,898 --> 01:05:50,714
Moira. You remember.
Jacobs' secretary.

34
01:05:50,794 --> 01:05:52,886
I know Moira, honey.

35
01:05:52,927 --> 01:05:55,099
What are you
talking about?

36
01:05:59,967 --> 01:06:02,661
She said he was
a Latin Jack Ryan.

37
01:06:02,742 --> 01:06:04,592
That's what
she called him.

38
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:06,443
I know.
The point is,

39
01:06:06,523 --> 01:06:09,098
he's Latin,
which, in my mind,

40
01:06:09,138 --> 01:06:11,069
connects her death
and Jacobs'

41
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:13,000
beyond their working
together.

42
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,091
You saw somebody
you think

43
01:06:15,132 --> 01:06:17,143
is responsible
for both killings?

44
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:21,649
She did.

45
01:06:23,217 --> 01:06:24,746
She did.

46
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:33,918
I saw him
from a distance...

47
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:35,366
from behind.

48
01:06:35,406 --> 01:06:36,331
Medium height,

49
01:06:36,331 --> 01:06:37,780
medium build,
et cetera?

50
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:39,348
Mind if I look?

51
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:42,486
Is that what the people
from the cabin said?

52
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:43,612
Yeah.

53
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:45,543
Did you check out

54
01:06:45,624 --> 01:06:47,475
these calls
to Venezuela?

55
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:52,221
Disconnected.

56
01:06:52,261 --> 01:06:53,670
O.K.

57
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:55,560
You have
no leads, huh?

58
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,973
I have
a lot of leads.

59
01:06:58,054 --> 01:06:59,502
I have
a fictitious name

60
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:00,508
on a register,

61
01:07:00,588 --> 01:07:03,324
a stolen, phoned-in
credit card number,

62
01:07:03,363 --> 01:07:04,812
two eyewitnesses,

63
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:08,272
one who saw a guy
but really didn't see him.

64
01:07:08,352 --> 01:07:10,403
Could you
play that again?

65
01:07:10,444 --> 01:07:11,691
Yes, sir.

66
01:07:13,058 --> 01:07:14,466
The machine

67
01:07:14,547 --> 01:07:15,875
is still on, Moira.

68
01:07:15,914 --> 01:07:18,569
You have a recording
of the killer's voice...

69
01:07:18,649 --> 01:07:20,339
maybe.

70
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,936
Jack, I think
we got something here.

71
01:07:27,017 --> 01:07:29,712
This is from
the answering machine,

72
01:07:29,752 --> 01:07:32,206
and this was recorded
yesterday.

73
01:07:32,247 --> 01:07:34,218
I'll play it for you.

74
01:07:34,257 --> 01:07:35,586
O.K.

75
01:07:36,994 --> 01:07:38,401
The machine

76
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:40,292
is still on, Moira.

77
01:07:40,372 --> 01:07:41,740
All right.

78
01:07:41,821 --> 01:07:43,108
And...

79
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:44,556
He's scared.

80
01:07:44,596 --> 01:07:48,216
I don't know what you said,
but it was right.

81
01:07:48,257 --> 01:07:51,274
Herb, run a match
on that for me.

82
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:56,865
He's Cuban...

83
01:07:56,946 --> 01:07:59,238
35 to 45...

84
01:07:59,279 --> 01:08:01,371
educated in
the United States...

85
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:04,186
Eastern
United States.

86
01:08:06,238 --> 01:08:07,364
You're sure?

87
01:08:07,405 --> 01:08:08,491
Yeah.

88
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:09,617
How sure?

89
01:08:14,404 --> 01:08:16,898
90%%%.

90
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:18,226
I need a name.

91
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:19,633
You're
talking about

92
01:08:19,714 --> 01:08:21,524
hundreds of thousands
of voices.

93
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,013
Yeah, I know.

94
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,574
300 is topside.

95
01:08:57,607 --> 01:08:59,418
101 is ready to fly.

96
01:08:59,498 --> 01:09:01,791
302 is on deck.

97
01:09:27,858 --> 01:09:30,151
Target is set.

98
01:09:32,122 --> 01:09:33,731
Hector!

99
01:09:33,771 --> 01:09:35,139
Enrique!

100
01:09:36,345 --> 01:09:38,558
Good
to see you!

101
01:09:38,599 --> 01:09:39,886
It was not easy.

102
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:41,133
Enrique,
how are you?

103
01:09:41,213 --> 01:09:43,346
Rojas...

104
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:45,557
Diaz.

105
01:09:47,006 --> 01:09:50,143
Oh, what the hell
is this?

106
01:09:50,184 --> 01:09:52,315
What the hell
is this?

107
01:09:53,201 --> 01:09:54,609
Ha ha ha!

108
01:09:54,689 --> 01:09:56,056
My new toy.

109
01:09:56,137 --> 01:09:57,787
You like it?

110
01:09:57,867 --> 01:10:00,281
You see this?

111
01:10:00,361 --> 01:10:01,528
That's
your new target,

112
01:10:09,815 --> 01:10:11,705
Variable,
this is Easy Rhino.

113
01:10:11,785 --> 01:10:13,234
Do you copy? Over.

114
01:10:13,314 --> 01:10:15,205
Loud and clear,
Easy Rhino.

115
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:18,222
Do we have a gig?
Over.

116
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:19,871
That's a rog.

117
01:10:25,462 --> 01:10:27,353
Target is lit.

118
01:10:28,962 --> 01:10:30,652
Start the music.

119
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:33,548
Into attack.

120
01:10:34,594 --> 01:10:36,002
Pickle is hot.

121
01:10:36,082 --> 01:10:38,094
Target is acquired
and lit.

122
01:10:38,174 --> 01:10:39,462
Coming down.

123
01:10:45,696 --> 01:10:47,265
Vega...

124
01:10:47,346 --> 01:10:50,645
Iooks like
a full house.

125
01:10:58,287 --> 01:10:59,615
Damn it!

126
01:10:59,695 --> 01:11:02,028
Why doesn't he
fix this road?

127
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:04,161
Shit.

128
01:11:04,241 --> 01:11:06,212
I thought
we had everybody.

129
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:09,470
Keep the target
painted.

130
01:11:36,905 --> 01:11:38,675
Sir.

131
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,749
Boom!

132
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,168
Mother of God.

133
01:11:58,467 --> 01:12:01,765
Circular error
probability zero.

134
01:12:01,845 --> 01:12:03,898
Impact with high-order
detonation.

135
01:12:03,937 --> 01:12:05,667
Have a nice day.

136
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:14,396
The man is completely
out of control.

137
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:19,223
The man is completely
out of control.

138
01:12:19,304 --> 01:12:21,436
Completely out of control.

139
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:25,137
His name is Cortez.

140
01:12:25,177 --> 01:12:27,269
Felix Cortez.

141
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:30,165
He was a colonel
in Cuba's lntelligence Service

142
01:12:30,246 --> 01:12:31,734
until a few years ago.

143
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:36,039
in Puerto Rico.

144
01:12:36,078 --> 01:12:38,372
Disappeared again.

145
01:12:40,463 --> 01:12:42,354
to a Cali cartel subject.

146
01:12:42,434 --> 01:12:44,687
I'll fax you
what I have.

147
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:48,992
I can't do that.

148
01:12:49,072 --> 01:12:51,164
Not you. The police.
The Colombians.

149
01:12:51,244 --> 01:12:52,853
The Colombian police,
Jack,

150
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:55,750
do not pick up
members of the cartel

151
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:59,008
unless they've got
a death wish.

152
01:12:59,088 --> 01:13:01,904
Wait a minute.

153
01:13:01,984 --> 01:13:03,312
Oh, Jesus.

154
01:13:03,392 --> 01:13:05,404
Jack, something's
happened here.

155
01:13:18,437 --> 01:13:20,972
At least 30 people
were killed,

156
01:13:21,052 --> 01:13:22,621
including
women and children.

157
01:13:22,701 --> 01:13:24,189
Police report
the bomb exploded

158
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:27,810
in a car belonging
to one of Rojas' associates.

159
01:13:27,891 --> 01:13:29,379
Jack! Jack!

160
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:31,953
Yeah.
Did this just happen?

161
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:33,441
Just now.

162
01:13:33,522 --> 01:13:35,855
...counsel of the Cali
cocaine cartel

163
01:13:35,935 --> 01:13:37,021
and a businessman.

164
01:13:37,102 --> 01:13:39,113
Send me
all the stuff.

165
01:13:39,194 --> 01:13:41,286
We'll put a tail on him
if we spot him.

166
01:13:41,366 --> 01:13:43,016
If he's still alive.

167
01:13:43,056 --> 01:13:44,464
I got to go.

168
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:46,918
...the latest in a series
of mysterious explosions.

169
01:13:47,038 --> 01:13:48,929
The cops
claim the violence...

170
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,659
You said it would be
a surgical strike.

171
01:13:50,739 --> 01:13:52,268
It was.
It was perfect.

172
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:56,452
"Hurt them."
That's what you said.

173
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,302
I know what I said, Bobby.

174
01:13:58,342 --> 01:14:00,112
Are you changing
your mind?

175
01:14:00,192 --> 01:14:02,727
No, I'm not.

176
01:14:02,808 --> 01:14:04,376
I hadn't counted on

177
01:14:04,457 --> 01:14:06,829
this kind of
collateral damage,

178
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:08,721
and neither did he.

179
01:14:08,801 --> 01:14:11,577
It'll be interpreted
like I said it would--

180
01:14:11,657 --> 01:14:12,583
rivalry ended

181
01:14:12,663 --> 01:14:14,955
in the blast
of a car-bomb.

182
01:14:15,036 --> 01:14:16,363
Good night.

183
01:14:16,363 --> 01:14:18,415
...indicates that
the guerrilla offensive

184
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:19,863
against the cartels

185
01:14:19,943 --> 01:14:23,041
by antidrug units
of the Colombian...

186
01:14:31,971 --> 01:14:33,057
You finish the report?

187
01:14:33,138 --> 01:14:34,304
Hot off the press.

188
01:14:34,385 --> 01:14:35,672
Thanks.

189
01:14:37,966 --> 01:14:40,701
Any chances any of these
bombing victims' names

190
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:41,867
are aliases?

191
01:14:41,948 --> 01:14:44,321
No. All l.D.s
have been confirmed.

192
01:14:44,402 --> 01:14:46,292
Who are you
hoping for?

193
01:14:46,332 --> 01:14:47,741
He's not here.
Cortez.

194
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:49,510
He's not here.

195
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:52,246
Um...

196
01:14:52,327 --> 01:14:54,780
why was Operations
copied on this?

197
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:56,751
Ritter requested it.

198
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:58,240
Ritter, huh?

199
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,734
You look
very nice today.

200
01:15:00,773 --> 01:15:02,665
Thank you.

201
01:15:16,623 --> 01:15:18,353
Car-bomb.

202
01:15:27,243 --> 01:15:30,099
What happens when
a car-bomb goes off?

203
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:31,587
It explodes.

204
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:33,961
Right. It blows up
and out.

205
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:35,409
And a missile?

206
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:36,776
Mm-hmm.

207
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:40,599
This deeper crater?

208
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:42,006
That's characteristic.

209
01:15:42,087 --> 01:15:44,782
O.K. Bring up
the satellite photo now.

210
01:15:49,851 --> 01:15:52,103
HMX...

211
01:15:52,143 --> 01:15:53,672
and TNT.

212
01:15:53,713 --> 01:15:56,046
When you
mix it 70/30,

213
01:15:56,126 --> 01:15:58,499
you get the compound
called octol.

214
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,873
Put enough explosives
in a car,

215
01:16:00,953 --> 01:16:02,804
you'll get
a big crater.

216
01:16:02,884 --> 01:16:05,337
Would the car
still be there?

217
01:16:05,418 --> 01:16:08,797
There would be pieces
all around here.

218
01:16:08,878 --> 01:16:11,532
And where is
octol made?

219
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:13,383
Lots of places--

220
01:16:13,463 --> 01:16:16,078
Europe, the U.S.

221
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,767
but nobody uses it.

222
01:16:17,849 --> 01:16:20,664
Nobody can afford it
except the military.

223
01:16:20,745 --> 01:16:22,836
An aerial bomb
would do that,

224
01:16:22,917 --> 01:16:26,134
but that's not
an aerial bomb.

225
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:27,583
It's not?

226
01:16:27,663 --> 01:16:28,790
No.

227
01:16:28,871 --> 01:16:32,330
There is also a cellulose
residue on everything.

228
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,543
There should
be shrapnel here,

229
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:36,111
but there isn't.

230
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:38,364
No bomb fragments.

231
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:24,342
"Cellulose encased
laser-guided bomb."

232
01:17:26,595 --> 01:17:28,486
Paper.

233
01:17:32,428 --> 01:17:34,118
The Americans are here?

234
01:18:02,398 --> 01:18:03,966
Ohh...

235
01:18:04,006 --> 01:18:06,299
We have something in common.

236
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:08,753
Neither of us
can implement policy

237
01:18:10,764 --> 01:18:12,132
from our employer.

238
01:18:12,212 --> 01:18:14,546
We have something else
in common.

239
01:18:14,586 --> 01:18:17,925
We both know there are
American troops in Colombia

240
01:18:18,005 --> 01:18:20,780
fighting an illegal war.

241
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:24,642
I will be staying
at the Hotel Paloma de Oro

242
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:26,573
in Panama City
on Wednesday.

243
01:18:26,654 --> 01:18:27,861
I suggest we meet.

244
01:19:17,621 --> 01:19:20,074
6, this is Point.
Over.

245
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,207
6 here.

246
01:19:22,247 --> 01:19:26,391
The stuff's here,
and there's a lot of it.

247
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:30,695
I'm also looking
at 100 to 150 men, armed,

248
01:19:30,775 --> 01:19:32,102
waiting around
for something.

249
01:19:32,183 --> 01:19:33,269
Over.

250
01:19:33,349 --> 01:19:35,200
Colombian Army?
Over.

251
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:41,999
Negative. They look
like mercenaries.

252
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:43,285
Over.

253
01:19:43,326 --> 01:19:44,694
All right.

254
01:19:44,774 --> 01:19:47,147
Get on back here.
Abort mission.

255
01:19:47,188 --> 01:19:48,716
Abort mission.
Out.

256
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:53,221
150 armed men, huh?

257
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:15,588
Raise your arms,
please.

258
01:20:30,149 --> 01:20:33,006
Thank you for responding
to my note.

259
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:36,466
You should know
that I had nothing to do

260
01:20:36,546 --> 01:20:38,154
with Mr. Jacobs' death.

261
01:20:38,235 --> 01:20:40,769
It was an act
of madness,

262
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:44,752
but a typical one
from the men I work for.

263
01:20:44,832 --> 01:20:46,361
What do you want?

264
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:49,137
Same as you.
Mineral water.

265
01:20:49,217 --> 01:20:52,999
Can we agree that as long
as Americans demand drugs,

266
01:20:53,079 --> 01:20:54,607
someone
will supply them?

267
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:57,866
Look. I don't want
to be here long.

268
01:20:57,946 --> 01:21:00,079
You mentioned
a gang war.

269
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,808
What does that mean?

270
01:21:01,888 --> 01:21:04,704
That you and I
want the same thing.

271
01:21:04,745 --> 01:21:06,152
The same thing.
Really?

272
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:08,365
Though you've
done all the work.

273
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:11,261
You've taken care
of the little fish.

274
01:21:11,342 --> 01:21:15,123
I will take care of
the one that got away.

275
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:16,651
Once Escobedo
is gone,

276
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:22,082
your country,
your people...

277
01:21:22,162 --> 01:21:25,140
by restructuring
the drug trade,

278
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,587
by regulating it.

279
01:21:26,668 --> 01:21:29,202
What will you say
if I promise you

280
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:31,616
I will reduce
the cocaine shipments

281
01:21:31,696 --> 01:21:33,990
to your country
by half?

282
01:21:34,029 --> 01:21:35,639
That you've
been using

283
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:37,570
too much
of your product.

284
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:39,018
Ha ha!

285
01:21:39,058 --> 01:21:40,948
I can also
promise you

286
01:21:40,989 --> 01:21:42,879
regular quotas
on major arrests

287
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,776
that your police
can take credit for.

288
01:21:45,816 --> 01:21:47,224
Imagine that--

289
01:21:47,304 --> 01:21:48,793
dramatic seizures,

290
01:21:48,874 --> 01:21:50,080
drastic reductions,

291
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,051
no more
senseless violence.

292
01:21:52,091 --> 01:21:55,109
You'll have
your victory.

293
01:21:58,849 --> 01:22:00,861
In return for what?

294
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:04,079
Well, I also
need a victory

295
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,568
to establish
my position

296
01:22:05,607 --> 01:22:07,820
with what's left
of the cartel

297
01:22:07,901 --> 01:22:10,434
so I can help you.

298
01:22:10,515 --> 01:22:12,808
I need to defeat
those soldiers

299
01:22:12,889 --> 01:22:14,739
blowing up
everything they see.

300
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:17,957
Give me maps
of their locations.

301
01:22:18,037 --> 01:22:20,572
Cut off
their communications.

302
01:22:27,732 --> 01:22:31,031
DEA's sending the audio
surveillance tape.

303
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,887
I haven't got it yet.

304
01:22:35,939 --> 01:22:38,312
You know what
you think about--

305
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:41,489
when you're
lying here?

306
01:22:42,737 --> 01:22:45,070
You know
you're going to die,

307
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:46,961
and you think...

308
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,892
that's all right.

309
01:22:48,972 --> 01:22:50,823
You lived
a long time.

310
01:22:50,903 --> 01:22:54,564
You got a family
that loved you.

311
01:22:54,644 --> 01:22:59,109
You had a job that
you thought made a difference,

312
01:22:59,149 --> 01:23:01,845
that you thought
was honorable...

313
01:23:01,925 --> 01:23:05,384
and then
you see this.

314
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:12,504
I'm afraid
if I dig any deeper,

315
01:23:12,545 --> 01:23:16,004
no one's going to
like what I find.

316
01:23:20,349 --> 01:23:24,573
You took an oath...

317
01:23:24,653 --> 01:23:27,267
if you recall...

318
01:23:30,003 --> 01:23:32,779
when you first came
to work for me,

319
01:23:32,819 --> 01:23:36,641
and I don't mean to
the National Security Advisor

320
01:23:36,681 --> 01:23:39,537
of the United States.

321
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:42,232
I mean to his boss.

322
01:23:43,801 --> 01:23:47,381
And I don't mean
the President.

323
01:23:47,461 --> 01:23:50,478
You gave your word...

324
01:23:50,559 --> 01:23:54,019
to...his boss.

325
01:23:54,099 --> 01:23:56,553
You gave your word

326
01:23:56,634 --> 01:24:02,345
to the people
of the United States.

327
01:24:02,386 --> 01:24:05,564
Your word
is who you are.

328
01:24:10,954 --> 01:24:12,844
What else
you got there?

329
01:24:17,712 --> 01:24:20,488
I brought you
some new magazines.

330
01:24:30,061 --> 01:24:31,953
The situation
in East Timor

331
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:33,441
seems to have
stabilized

332
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,849
during the day.

333
01:24:34,929 --> 01:24:36,337
Good.

334
01:24:36,377 --> 01:24:37,785
Is that it?

335
01:24:37,866 --> 01:24:39,716
Except for
the other thing.

336
01:24:39,797 --> 01:24:41,607
We've accomplished
a lot.

337
01:24:41,687 --> 01:24:44,342
We're seeing
tangible results.

338
01:24:44,382 --> 01:24:45,830
Drug shipments
are down.

339
01:24:45,871 --> 01:24:48,244
Price on the street
is rising.

340
01:24:48,284 --> 01:24:50,174
Perception is that
the administration

341
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:51,703
is doing
something right.

342
01:24:51,784 --> 01:24:54,801
What's
the bad news?

343
01:24:56,651 --> 01:24:59,024
I'm concerned about
this latest incident--

344
01:24:59,106 --> 01:25:01,439
the car-bomb
coming so soon

345
01:25:01,478 --> 01:25:03,168
after Jacobs'
assassination.

346
01:25:03,249 --> 01:25:07,070
It's the kind of thing
reporters live for.

347
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:09,605
They'd love to
make a connection.

348
01:25:09,685 --> 01:25:11,736
And you think
they will.

349
01:25:11,817 --> 01:25:15,236
I think it's time
the whole thing went away.

350
01:25:16,925 --> 01:25:18,816
If that's
what you think.

351
01:25:18,856 --> 01:25:20,747
I think so.

352
01:25:22,437 --> 01:25:24,569
Then it should
go away.

353
01:25:24,609 --> 01:25:26,338
It never happened.

354
01:25:27,827 --> 01:25:29,396
Yes, sir.

355
01:25:31,568 --> 01:25:35,269
Well, I mean,
it's possible.

356
01:25:35,349 --> 01:25:36,476
It would be
a lot easier

357
01:25:36,556 --> 01:25:38,689
if you told me
whose system

358
01:25:38,769 --> 01:25:40,458
you wanted me
to break into.

359
01:25:40,538 --> 01:25:41,464
Good morning,
Dr. Ryan.

360
01:25:41,585 --> 01:25:42,590
Morning.

361
01:26:01,014 --> 01:26:02,422
Well...

362
01:26:02,462 --> 01:26:05,198
we're way beyond
birthdays now.

363
01:26:05,278 --> 01:26:07,893
I'm going to
have to write

364
01:26:07,973 --> 01:26:10,105
a special program here.

365
01:26:13,444 --> 01:26:14,812
Right.

366
01:26:21,127 --> 01:26:22,615
O.K., sweetheart...

367
01:26:22,656 --> 01:26:25,391
Iet's get to work.

368
01:26:25,432 --> 01:26:27,644
Fine. Good.

369
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:30,018
Yes!

370
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:33,235
Here we go.

371
01:27:07,871 --> 01:27:09,359
Jesus.

372
01:27:28,145 --> 01:27:31,404
"Reciprocity."
What's that?

373
01:27:43,069 --> 01:27:44,798
I forgot
to tell you.

374
01:27:44,879 --> 01:27:46,729
After
you get the code,

375
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:50,029
wait until he's off
before you log on

376
01:27:50,068 --> 01:27:52,482
because he'll
know when you do.

377
01:27:52,562 --> 01:27:53,769
It's too late.

378
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:55,499
Oh, my God.

379
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:27,238
Cutter.

380
01:28:40,513 --> 01:28:41,881
Yeah.

381
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,812
Uh, Bob.
Jack Ryan here.

382
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,823
Good morning,
Jack.

383
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:47,271
I was just thinking.

384
01:28:47,311 --> 01:28:50,127
Maybe we got off
to a bad start.

385
01:28:50,207 --> 01:28:52,581
We're going to be
working together.

386
01:28:52,662 --> 01:28:55,195
Maybe we should
get to know each other.

387
01:28:55,316 --> 01:28:56,684
You play tennis?

388
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:57,770
Hmm?

389
01:28:57,851 --> 01:28:59,741
Tennis.
Do you play tennis?

390
01:28:59,781 --> 01:29:01,190
Yeah,
I play tennis.

391
01:29:01,229 --> 01:29:03,804
How about we
get together sometime?

392
01:29:03,925 --> 01:29:05,292
Next week maybe.

393
01:29:05,372 --> 01:29:08,671
Hour before we start work
or something.

394
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:14,987
Jack...

395
01:29:15,067 --> 01:29:16,113
Yeah.

396
01:29:21,182 --> 01:29:23,073
Shit.

397
01:29:24,118 --> 01:29:27,256
So are crimes
against the Constitution.

398
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:30,153
Son of a bitch!

399
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,272
Son of a bitch!

400
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:49,743
Come on. Come on.

401
01:29:52,076 --> 01:29:53,203
Clark.

402
01:29:58,995 --> 01:30:00,845
Shit!

403
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:03,621
Son of a bitch!

404
01:30:06,437 --> 01:30:07,966
Yep.

405
01:30:29,406 --> 01:30:30,935
You're going
to jail.

406
01:30:31,015 --> 01:30:33,711
What is that?
Hmm?

407
01:30:33,831 --> 01:30:36,687
What do you think
you have there?

408
01:30:37,814 --> 01:30:41,916
You are
such a Boy Scout.

409
01:30:42,038 --> 01:30:43,647
Look at you.

410
01:30:43,767 --> 01:30:46,583
You see everything
in black and white.

411
01:30:46,664 --> 01:30:48,997
No. Not black
and white, Ritter.

412
01:30:49,078 --> 01:30:50,405
Right and wrong!

413
01:30:50,525 --> 01:30:53,099
You see?
There you go again.

414
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,594
Why was I kept out?

415
01:30:55,594 --> 01:30:58,088
You're neck-deep in it.

416
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:01,186
You went before Congress
and got the money.

417
01:31:01,306 --> 01:31:02,794
You lied to Congress.

418
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,283
I never lied!

419
01:31:04,323 --> 01:31:07,179
You told them no troops.
There are troops.

420
01:31:07,219 --> 01:31:09,110
I didn't know that!

421
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:12,006
No. "I have
no recollection of that."

422
01:31:12,047 --> 01:31:14,902
That's the term
you have to learn.

423
01:31:14,943 --> 01:31:16,351
Who authorized
this?

424
01:31:16,392 --> 01:31:18,764
I'm sure they'll
ask you that.

425
01:31:18,845 --> 01:31:20,132
Who authorized
this?

426
01:31:20,213 --> 01:31:23,552
I have no recollection,
Senator.

427
01:31:23,672 --> 01:31:25,522
Ohh...

428
01:31:27,695 --> 01:31:30,551
I did not
sign up for this.

429
01:31:30,631 --> 01:31:33,086
This is somebody's
bullshit political agenda.

430
01:31:33,206 --> 01:31:35,297
Who authorized this?
Cutter?

431
01:31:35,419 --> 01:31:37,389
Cutter couldn't
tie his shoes

432
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:39,360
without permission.

433
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,027
If I go down,

434
01:31:44,108 --> 01:31:46,159
you're going with me.

435
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,688
Wrong again.

436
01:31:47,808 --> 01:31:51,710
I have an autographed
get-out-of-jail-free card.

437
01:31:53,118 --> 01:31:54,606
"The President authorizes

438
01:31:54,727 --> 01:31:57,945
"the Deputy Director CIA
Robert Ritter

439
01:31:58,066 --> 01:31:59,433
"to conduct
Operation Reciprocity,

440
01:31:59,474 --> 01:32:02,329
"including all support
necessary to such activity.

441
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:04,301
"This operation
is deemed important

442
01:32:04,341 --> 01:32:07,197
to the national security
of the United States."

443
01:32:07,278 --> 01:32:09,450
Et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera.

444
01:32:11,341 --> 01:32:12,669
You don't have

445
01:32:12,749 --> 01:32:15,806
one of these,
do you, Jack?

446
01:32:23,851 --> 01:32:25,501
Gray!

447
01:32:26,587 --> 01:32:29,202
The world
is gray, Jack!

448
01:33:00,096 --> 01:33:01,423
Got any idea

449
01:33:01,504 --> 01:33:05,123
how I'm going to
get out of this mess?

450
01:33:05,244 --> 01:33:08,140
Absolutely none.

451
01:33:16,307 --> 01:33:17,956
Yeah.

452
01:33:19,525 --> 01:33:21,054
This is he.

453
01:33:24,674 --> 01:33:26,163
When?

454
01:33:28,898 --> 01:33:30,265
Uh-huh.

455
01:33:30,345 --> 01:33:31,794
James?

456
01:33:34,047 --> 01:33:35,334
Thank you.

457
01:33:36,621 --> 01:33:38,512
Admiral James Greer

458
01:33:38,593 --> 01:33:40,845
devoted his life
to his country

459
01:33:40,926 --> 01:33:43,299
and his family,

460
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:52,309
He served his country
for more than 50 years,

461
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:55,326
enlisting in the Navy
at 17,

462
01:33:55,447 --> 01:33:58,102
graduating
from the Academy,

463
01:33:58,223 --> 01:34:01,521
achieving three stars
for his flag.

464
01:34:01,602 --> 01:34:04,176
He lived through
tumultuous events

465
01:34:04,297 --> 01:34:06,188
in his country's life.

466
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,176
He made them clearer
to the rest of us

467
01:34:11,257 --> 01:34:13,267
with his knowledge,
his honesty,

468
01:34:12,384 --> 01:34:15,721
his integrity,
and his courage.

469
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:28,715
I can't see them,
but I know they're down there,

470
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:31,731
5 kilometers due east
from your position.

471
01:34:35,312 --> 01:34:37,806
Keep pushing forward.
We'll trap them.

472
01:34:37,926 --> 01:34:40,742
Never, though,
was he deluded into thinking

473
01:34:40,823 --> 01:34:42,432
that one man

474
01:34:42,553 --> 01:34:45,369
could solve the ills
of the world.

475
01:34:45,409 --> 01:34:48,184
Always the soldier

476
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:50,397
on battlefields
of the South Pacific,

477
01:34:50,517 --> 01:34:52,569
Korea, Vietnam,
and Washington,

478
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:55,103
he fought
as part of a unit

479
01:34:55,184 --> 01:34:57,598
to preserve the ideals...

480
01:34:57,638 --> 01:34:59,528
Knife, this is
Variable. Over.

481
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:00,976
...of his nation.

482
01:35:01,057 --> 01:35:03,551
Knife, this is
Variable. Over.

483
01:35:04,838 --> 01:35:07,091
...to the refuge
of the earth

484
01:35:07,212 --> 01:35:08,942
we entrust
our friend's body.

485
01:35:09,022 --> 01:35:11,918
To the protection
of our God in heaven

486
01:35:11,959 --> 01:35:13,286
we entrust his soul.

487
01:35:13,367 --> 01:35:17,791
To ourselves,
we entrust his spirit

488
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:20,487
and the principles
he lived by.

489
01:35:20,607 --> 01:35:24,067
We're going
to miss you, James.

490
01:35:45,709 --> 01:35:47,599
Variable,
this is Knife. Over.

491
01:35:48,927 --> 01:35:51,742
Variable,
this is Knife. Over.

492
01:35:51,823 --> 01:35:55,322
Variable, this is Knife.
I am not receiving.

493
01:35:55,444 --> 01:35:57,655
We are under
heavy attack. Over.

494
01:35:57,777 --> 01:35:58,863
Go! Go! Go!

495
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:21,350
Variable,
this is Knife. Over.

496
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:23,079
Switch.

497
01:36:47,336 --> 01:36:49,870
Aah!

498
01:36:53,772 --> 01:36:55,703
Variable,
this is Knife.

499
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:58,116
Where the hell
are you?

500
01:37:12,558 --> 01:37:14,851
Present!

501
01:37:14,931 --> 01:37:16,139
Ho!

502
01:37:18,552 --> 01:37:20,925
On behalf of
a grateful nation,

503
01:37:20,966 --> 01:37:22,333
our condolences.

504
01:37:22,413 --> 01:37:24,828
He was a very
great patriot.

505
01:37:24,867 --> 01:37:26,758
Thank you.

506
01:38:03,244 --> 01:38:04,088
Hello.

507
01:38:04,168 --> 01:38:06,019
Jean Fowler
for Dr. Ryan.

508
01:38:06,099 --> 01:38:07,467
This is he.

509
01:38:10,524 --> 01:38:11,731
O.K.

510
01:38:11,812 --> 01:38:13,943
I picked it up
this morning.

511
01:38:14,024 --> 01:38:15,633
Variable, this is Knife.

512
01:38:15,674 --> 01:38:19,817
I am not receiving, but I said,
"We're under heavy attack!"

513
01:38:19,897 --> 01:38:23,075
Variable, this is Knife!
Where the hell are you?

514
01:38:23,156 --> 01:38:26,696
What do you want me
to do with this?

515
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:29,713
Make a copy, Jean.

516
01:38:29,794 --> 01:38:31,966
Make 10 copies.

517
01:38:32,046 --> 01:38:35,103
Get them to me
quick as you can.

518
01:38:37,396 --> 01:38:38,885
Jesus.

519
01:38:38,965 --> 01:38:40,292
They're going to

520
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:42,344
Ieave those guys
down there.

521
01:39:23,334 --> 01:39:25,668
He's on American 915.

522
01:39:25,708 --> 01:39:28,082
He'll be
in Bogota 7:50.

523
01:39:39,989 --> 01:39:41,557
Yeah?

524
01:39:41,598 --> 01:39:42,885
It's Ritter.

525
01:39:42,965 --> 01:39:44,776
Where the fuck
you been?

526
01:39:44,816 --> 01:39:46,384
We have a problem.

527
01:39:46,425 --> 01:39:49,482
A problem? I can't get
through to my men!

528
01:39:49,562 --> 01:39:51,413
We had to
shut down

529
01:39:51,493 --> 01:39:53,022
the satellite
link.

530
01:39:54,632 --> 01:39:56,039
Clark.

531
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:57,608
Had to what?

532
01:39:58,976 --> 01:40:00,705
It's Ryan.

533
01:40:00,786 --> 01:40:02,556
He found out
everything,

534
01:40:02,636 --> 01:40:04,929
threatened to walk
up the Hill

535
01:40:05,009 --> 01:40:07,826
if we didn't
shut down the operation.

536
01:40:07,866 --> 01:40:09,757
O.K. O.K.
It's shut down.

537
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:14,624
Just give me some air,
and my men are out of there.

538
01:40:14,704 --> 01:40:16,997
Clark, maybe
you're not hearing me.

539
01:40:17,078 --> 01:40:18,687
There is no air.

540
01:40:18,768 --> 01:40:22,066
There is nothing.
We are shut down.

541
01:40:22,146 --> 01:40:27,175
I'm on a plane.
I'm going to kill him.

542
01:40:27,255 --> 01:40:28,864
Ritter?

543
01:40:30,353 --> 01:40:33,531
Don't get on a plane.
He's coming to you,

544
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:35,582
arriving on American
Airlines, 1950 hours,

545
01:40:35,662 --> 01:40:37,070
with no security.

546
01:40:37,111 --> 01:40:38,479
Who is this?

547
01:40:38,559 --> 01:40:39,926
National Security
Adviser

548
01:40:40,007 --> 01:40:41,737
James Cutter,
Mr. Clark.

549
01:40:41,817 --> 01:40:44,753
Once Ryan's gone,
we're back on-line.

550
01:40:44,834 --> 01:40:46,362
You understand?

551
01:40:48,092 --> 01:40:49,621
Yes, sir.

552
01:42:08,304 --> 01:42:09,914
Clark.

553
01:42:09,953 --> 01:42:11,402
Hey. Jesus.

554
01:42:11,442 --> 01:42:13,131
Get in the van.

555
01:42:13,212 --> 01:42:15,103
I came to find you.

556
01:42:15,143 --> 01:42:17,315
You found me. Get in.

557
01:42:17,356 --> 01:42:19,246
All right.

558
01:42:19,286 --> 01:42:20,614
All right.

559
01:42:20,695 --> 01:42:22,303
Behind the wheel!

560
01:42:23,591 --> 01:42:25,159
Clark--

561
01:42:26,367 --> 01:42:27,894
Drive!

562
01:42:54,726 --> 01:42:56,375
Ritter.

563
01:42:56,455 --> 01:42:57,944
Ryan's dead.

564
01:42:59,513 --> 01:43:00,599
How?

565
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,329
I killed him.

566
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:04,944
Turn the Op back on.

567
01:43:07,438 --> 01:43:08,363
Clark--

568
01:43:08,403 --> 01:43:10,777
you said,
"Get rid of Ryan,

569
01:43:10,816 --> 01:43:12,908
and we're back
in business," right?

570
01:43:36,199 --> 01:43:39,177
What the hell
are you doing here?

571
01:43:41,067 --> 01:43:44,527
I came to help you
get those guys out.

572
01:43:45,693 --> 01:43:48,630
What can you do
to help me?

573
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:55,469
What do you need?

574
01:43:56,836 --> 01:43:58,525
A helicopter.

575
01:44:00,496 --> 01:44:03,474
A helicopter.

576
01:44:10,473 --> 01:44:12,847
No, thank you.

577
01:44:15,059 --> 01:44:16,909
What is this,
Happy Hour?

578
01:44:16,990 --> 01:44:18,599
It's always
Happy Hour.

579
01:44:18,679 --> 01:44:20,570
Your pilot
owns this joint?

580
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:22,138
He lives here.

581
01:44:27,288 --> 01:44:29,098
Here he is.

582
01:44:39,355 --> 01:44:40,723
Good morning.

583
01:44:40,804 --> 01:44:42,251
Good morning.

584
01:44:42,332 --> 01:44:44,746
I'm here
to rent the Huey.

585
01:44:44,786 --> 01:44:47,200
Sorry. We don't
rent it anymore,

586
01:44:47,321 --> 01:44:49,493
but it is
for sale.

587
01:44:49,573 --> 01:44:52,067
Uh, how much is it?

588
01:44:53,113 --> 01:44:55,204
$2 million.

589
01:45:00,113 --> 01:45:01,963
Um, my pilot and I

590
01:45:02,043 --> 01:45:04,699
would have to take
a test flight.

591
01:45:04,779 --> 01:45:07,032
Yes. Just leave
a deposit.

592
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:09,687
How much is that?

593
01:45:09,767 --> 01:45:12,060
$2 million.

594
01:45:15,157 --> 01:45:16,364
Um...

595
01:45:16,485 --> 01:45:19,662
would you take
a company check?

596
01:45:26,702 --> 01:45:28,553
Yes.

597
01:45:35,754 --> 01:45:37,121
Here we go.

598
01:45:37,201 --> 01:45:41,104
She's a big son of a bitch,
ain't she?

599
01:45:41,224 --> 01:45:44,161
You have any time
in this type?

600
01:45:44,282 --> 01:45:46,293
9:00.

601
01:45:55,384 --> 01:45:57,275
Get out of
my chopper.

602
01:45:57,315 --> 01:45:59,688
No, no, no.
My chopper.

603
01:45:59,768 --> 01:46:01,660
Let's go.

604
01:46:20,405 --> 01:46:24,628
Their last communication
put them here.

605
01:46:24,669 --> 01:46:29,295
The closest extraction
point is here,

606
01:46:29,335 --> 01:46:30,703
in this gorge.

607
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,237
I got it.

608
01:46:51,379 --> 01:46:53,552
Is that a body
down there?

609
01:46:53,632 --> 01:46:55,684
Yeah.

610
01:46:57,092 --> 01:46:58,539
One of ours?

611
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:01,034
One of mine.

612
01:47:03,448 --> 01:47:06,183
Find a place
to set her down.

613
01:47:06,263 --> 01:47:08,596
We'll look
for the others.

614
01:47:50,111 --> 01:47:52,806
Nowhere to run to.

615
01:47:52,886 --> 01:47:54,736
No place to hide.

616
01:47:54,817 --> 01:47:57,231
Blood trails
everywhere.

617
01:47:57,351 --> 01:48:00,127
They all lead
to the river.

618
01:48:12,959 --> 01:48:16,258
These are the falls
we saw from the air.

619
01:48:16,338 --> 01:48:18,229
All right.
They should be

620
01:48:18,269 --> 01:48:20,361
about 50 meters
down.

621
01:48:32,268 --> 01:48:34,642
You left us!
You left us!

622
01:48:34,681 --> 01:48:35,728
Hey!

623
01:48:35,808 --> 01:48:37,820
With no support
at all!

624
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:40,273
You left us!
Son of a--

625
01:48:40,314 --> 01:48:41,721
Easy! Easy!

626
01:48:41,802 --> 01:48:42,686
Easy, son!

627
01:48:42,727 --> 01:48:45,301
Get off!
It's not his fault!

628
01:48:45,422 --> 01:48:48,721
Whose fault is it?

629
01:48:48,842 --> 01:48:50,933
It's my fault.

630
01:48:55,519 --> 01:48:57,410
It's my fault.

631
01:49:09,397 --> 01:49:11,288
I was on point

632
01:49:11,368 --> 01:49:14,345
when the last
attack came,

633
01:49:14,425 --> 01:49:16,356
over a mile away.

634
01:49:17,966 --> 01:49:20,178
By the time
we got back,

635
01:49:20,258 --> 01:49:21,425
it was over.

636
01:49:21,505 --> 01:49:24,965
They were taking
Captain and Oso.

637
01:49:25,045 --> 01:49:26,855
The others?

638
01:49:28,263 --> 01:49:30,194
I buried them.

639
01:49:37,958 --> 01:49:39,849
Road to the town.

640
01:49:39,889 --> 01:49:41,941
They loaded
the prisoners here.

641
01:49:42,061 --> 01:49:43,388
Blood everywhere.

642
01:49:43,469 --> 01:49:45,843
God knows where
they are now.

643
01:49:45,923 --> 01:49:47,291
Escobedo knows.

644
01:49:47,371 --> 01:49:50,267
Are you going to
knock on his door?

645
01:49:57,227 --> 01:49:59,600
Good morning.
I'd like to see

646
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,088
Ernesto Escobedo.

647
01:50:01,129 --> 01:50:03,019
I don't have
an appointment.

648
01:50:03,099 --> 01:50:04,548
Gracias.

649
01:50:04,628 --> 01:50:05,674
Sure.

650
01:50:15,409 --> 01:50:16,696
O.K.

651
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:21,161
Arms up.

652
01:50:21,283 --> 01:50:23,535
Arms up!

653
01:50:37,132 --> 01:50:38,902
He's in.

654
01:50:42,643 --> 01:50:45,499
Bird, this is Variable.
Over.

655
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:50,326
Bird, this is Variable.
Over.

656
01:51:06,256 --> 01:51:08,347
Dr. Ryan.

657
01:51:23,110 --> 01:51:24,518
Sit down.

658
01:51:24,599 --> 01:51:27,496
What can I
do for you?

659
01:51:27,576 --> 01:51:31,679
Well, I didn't know
who else to turn to.

660
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,977
I have a problem.

661
01:51:35,058 --> 01:51:36,626
An associate
of mine,

662
01:51:36,667 --> 01:51:39,000
a coffee buyer
and his assistant,

663
01:51:39,081 --> 01:51:40,851
were on
a business trip

664
01:51:40,931 --> 01:51:42,259
in this area.

665
01:51:42,339 --> 01:51:43,948
They unexpectedly
disappeared yesterday.

666
01:51:44,029 --> 01:51:45,396
I'm very concerned.

667
01:51:45,476 --> 01:51:46,844
Coffee buyer.

668
01:51:46,925 --> 01:51:49,258
Mmm. It's very
important to me

669
01:51:49,338 --> 01:51:50,706
to find them.

670
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:52,516
Coffee buying
is becoming

671
01:51:52,597 --> 01:51:54,206
a very dangerous
business.

672
01:51:54,246 --> 01:51:56,096
Yes.

673
01:51:56,137 --> 01:52:00,441
Yes. Well, it was
for Peter Hardin.

674
01:52:02,412 --> 01:52:03,499
Who?

675
01:52:03,579 --> 01:52:05,429
A client
of Lindo Coffee.

676
01:52:05,469 --> 01:52:07,360
Lindo Coffee
has many clients.

677
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:10,618
Well, you must have
heard of this one.

678
01:52:10,698 --> 01:52:12,308
He owed your company

679
01:52:12,388 --> 01:52:14,239
a great deal
of money.

680
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:17,015
Oh? Well,
I'll have to talk

681
01:52:17,095 --> 01:52:19,468
to Accounting
about that.

682
01:52:19,509 --> 01:52:22,646
$650 million.

683
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:26,951
And change.

684
01:52:29,042 --> 01:52:31,335
Are you offering
to help me

685
01:52:31,415 --> 01:52:34,271
with the collection
of an unpaid debt?

686
01:52:34,312 --> 01:52:35,398
No.

687
01:52:35,479 --> 01:52:37,248
What are you offering?

688
01:52:40,265 --> 01:52:42,639
Felix Cortez
has sold you out.

689
01:52:42,679 --> 01:52:45,535
His next move
is to murder you

690
01:52:45,576 --> 01:52:47,466
and take over
the cartel.

691
01:52:47,507 --> 01:52:49,558
Where is
my tape recorder?

692
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:57,684
Play the tape.

693
01:53:11,723 --> 01:53:13,774
Mira! Mira! Mira!

694
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,192
Let's move.

695
01:53:59,874 --> 01:54:03,213
I'd like you to meet
my new friend--

696
01:54:03,293 --> 01:54:04,661
Dr. Ryan.

697
01:54:04,742 --> 01:54:06,753
Doctor? Why?
ls somebody sick?

698
01:54:19,987 --> 01:54:21,877
What does he want?

699
01:54:23,849 --> 01:54:26,906
The safe return
of his associates.

700
01:54:26,986 --> 01:54:31,050
And, uh, what does
he offer us in return?

701
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:32,497
You.

702
01:54:38,492 --> 01:54:41,066
Whatever this man
told you is a lie.

703
01:54:41,147 --> 01:54:42,997
He lies for a living.

704
01:54:43,078 --> 01:54:44,968
He's in the lntelligence
business.

705
01:54:45,048 --> 01:54:45,893
Exactly.

706
01:54:45,974 --> 01:54:48,347
You're in the
lntelligence business!

707
01:54:54,019 --> 01:54:56,794
You've taken care of
the little fish.

708
01:54:56,875 --> 01:55:00,858
I will take care
of the one that got away.

709
01:55:00,938 --> 01:55:02,587
Once Escobedo is gone,

710
01:55:02,627 --> 01:55:05,846
I will be in a position
to help you.

711
01:55:05,926 --> 01:55:09,024
The question is...

712
01:55:09,063 --> 01:55:11,759
what am I supposed
to do with you?

713
01:55:11,839 --> 01:55:12,886
Ugh!

714
01:55:15,058 --> 01:55:16,144
Well?

715
01:55:16,224 --> 01:55:19,603
Guess I'm supposed to
hit you with this bat!

716
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:26,361
I can also promise you...

717
01:55:26,402 --> 01:55:27,849
Get up!

718
01:55:27,930 --> 01:55:31,269
major arrests that your police
can take credit for...

719
01:55:33,683 --> 01:55:35,895
dramatic seizures,
drastic reductions,

720
01:55:35,975 --> 01:55:37,785
no violence
to speak of.

721
01:55:37,866 --> 01:55:39,716
You'll have your victory.

722
01:55:41,205 --> 01:55:43,458
ln return for what?

723
01:56:21,955 --> 01:56:23,282
Where are they?

724
01:56:23,363 --> 01:56:25,575
They're here.

725
01:56:25,655 --> 01:56:27,023
Seal the plant!

726
01:56:27,104 --> 01:56:28,793
The American killed
Ernesto!

727
01:56:28,874 --> 01:56:31,005
Come on! Move!
Let's go!

728
01:57:16,301 --> 01:57:19,599
Bird to Variable.

729
01:57:33,799 --> 01:57:35,569
Where the hell
are you?

730
01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:36,977
Well, I'm cruisin'

731
01:57:37,057 --> 01:57:40,637
about 5 klicks south
of the village. Over.

732
01:57:40,718 --> 01:57:43,494
Stay there. I'll get
back to you.

733
01:57:43,574 --> 01:57:45,264
Roger that.

734
01:57:56,568 --> 01:57:57,976
No one.

735
01:57:58,015 --> 01:57:59,746
The prisoners.

736
01:58:10,365 --> 01:58:12,980
Oh.

737
01:58:43,673 --> 01:58:46,007
Come on, guys.
Let's go, son.

738
01:58:48,259 --> 01:58:50,753
We're goin' home, boys.

739
02:00:01,632 --> 02:00:04,448
Pick us up at
the Lindo Coffee Factory.

740
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,928
Psst!

741
02:01:30,171 --> 02:01:32,987
From your point of view,

742
02:01:33,067 --> 02:01:36,808
it can eliminate a potential
security problem, does it not?

743
02:01:36,889 --> 02:01:40,228
Not only can I expose you
to the press,

744
02:01:40,349 --> 02:01:42,038
so can the soldiers,

745
02:01:42,119 --> 02:01:44,813
or do you want to take
your chances

746
02:01:46,905 --> 02:01:50,365
ending the political career
of your Commander-ln-Chief?

747
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:08,467
Aah!

748
02:02:34,856 --> 02:02:36,384
Let's go!

749
02:03:02,652 --> 02:03:07,278
Get your asses in here!
Come on! We got to go!

750
02:03:09,490 --> 02:03:10,898
Come on!

751
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:13,192
Get your butts in here!

752
02:03:18,099 --> 02:03:20,593
Hold it!
We wait for Ryan!

753
02:03:20,714 --> 02:03:22,806
Yeah? We're out
of here!

754
02:03:29,483 --> 02:03:32,742
Set it down!
He's down there!

755
02:03:44,609 --> 02:03:46,017
Come on!

756
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:06,371
I got you!

757
02:04:12,445 --> 02:04:15,301
Chavez, cover me!

758
02:04:24,031 --> 02:04:27,370
Your hand!
Give me your hand!

759
02:05:30,042 --> 02:05:32,778
President will
see you now, sir.

760
02:05:44,967 --> 02:05:46,375
Jack.

761
02:05:46,456 --> 02:05:49,271
I'm glad you're here.

762
02:05:49,352 --> 02:05:50,720
Sit down.

763
02:05:50,759 --> 02:05:53,133
Can I get you anything?

764
02:05:53,214 --> 02:05:54,943
No.

765
02:05:56,110 --> 02:05:57,960
Come on. Sit down.

766
02:05:58,041 --> 02:06:00,575
I would prefer
to stand, sir.

767
02:06:02,385 --> 02:06:05,201
Some things have
gone on here

768
02:06:05,241 --> 02:06:07,816
that I'm just
becoming aware of.

769
02:06:07,896 --> 02:06:10,229
I was kept
in the dark--

770
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:13,125
as you were--
for a very long time.

771
02:06:13,206 --> 02:06:14,211
Troubling things.

772
02:06:14,292 --> 02:06:15,660
Yeah.

773
02:06:15,700 --> 02:06:17,993
Now we have to
figure out

774
02:06:18,073 --> 02:06:19,843
who is responsible
for what

775
02:06:19,924 --> 02:06:22,257
and what to do
about it,

776
02:06:21,333 --> 02:06:25,153
and we have to
do this delicately,

777
02:06:25,194 --> 02:06:28,009
otherwise people might
get the wrong idea.

778
02:06:28,090 --> 02:06:29,658
We have to lie.

779
02:06:30,905 --> 02:06:32,836
Did I say that?

780
02:06:32,917 --> 02:06:35,169
No, you didn't.

781
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:37,784
You're upset.

782
02:06:37,865 --> 02:06:39,192
I'm upset.

783
02:06:39,273 --> 02:06:41,606
Well,
it's understandable.

784
02:06:41,686 --> 02:06:45,387
You mind if I give you
a bit of advice?

785
02:06:45,428 --> 02:06:48,083
You know this because
you're a smart guy.

786
02:06:48,163 --> 02:06:51,140
Never make important
decisions while you're upset.

787
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:52,427
You did,

788
02:06:52,508 --> 02:06:54,841
and American soldiers
and innocent civilians

789
02:06:54,921 --> 02:06:56,772
are dead because of it.

790
02:06:56,852 --> 02:06:59,145
I never ordered any--

791
02:06:59,225 --> 02:07:01,799
I will not let you
dishonor their memories

792
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,897
by pretending you had
nothing to do with it.

793
02:07:04,977 --> 02:07:07,391
How dare you
lecture me?

794
02:07:07,472 --> 02:07:09,081
How dare you, sir?

795
02:07:09,161 --> 02:07:11,494
How dare you
bark at me

796
02:07:11,535 --> 02:07:13,345
Iike some little
junkyard dog?

797
02:07:13,385 --> 02:07:16,322
I am the President
of the United States!

798
02:07:19,822 --> 02:07:23,120
It gives me no pleasure
to do it, sir.

799
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:25,574
As Acting Deputy Director
of lntelligence,

800
02:07:25,654 --> 02:07:28,430
it is my duty to
report this matter

801
02:07:28,511 --> 02:07:30,924
to the Senate
Oversight Committee.

802
02:07:35,228 --> 02:07:37,722
You're not going
to do that.

803
02:07:38,888 --> 02:07:40,296
I'm not?

804
02:07:40,337 --> 02:07:42,348
No, no.

805
02:07:42,429 --> 02:07:47,296
You've got yourself
a chip in the big game now.

806
02:07:47,377 --> 02:07:49,630
You're going to
tuck that away

807
02:07:49,669 --> 02:07:52,404
for a time
when your own ass

808
02:07:52,486 --> 02:07:54,014
is on the line.

809
02:07:54,094 --> 02:07:56,749
Then you're going
to pull it out,

810
02:07:56,790 --> 02:07:59,927
and I'm going to
cash it in for you,

811
02:08:00,007 --> 02:08:01,858
right?

812
02:08:01,899 --> 02:08:05,077
I don't think I
have anything more

813
02:08:05,157 --> 02:08:07,128
to say to you, sir.

814
02:08:07,208 --> 02:08:09,260
The country
can't afford

815
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:11,874
another scandal,
Jack.

816
02:08:11,955 --> 02:08:13,282
To protect itself,

817
02:08:15,374 --> 02:08:16,702
of another deception

818
02:08:16,783 --> 02:08:19,598
that goes all
the way to the top.

819
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:21,328
You'll take
the blame.

820
02:08:21,368 --> 02:08:24,224
Cutter and Ritter
will take some, too,

821
02:08:24,264 --> 02:08:27,121
but just a slap
on the wrist

822
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:29,091
and then $20,000
an hour

823
02:08:29,132 --> 02:08:30,983
on the lecture
circuit.

824
02:08:31,022 --> 02:08:32,873
The rest
of the blame

825
02:08:32,953 --> 02:08:34,924
will fall on Greer.

826
02:08:38,907 --> 02:08:41,763
You'll destroy
his reputation,

827
02:08:41,803 --> 02:08:44,660
but that's as far
as it will go.

828
02:08:44,699 --> 02:08:47,757
The old Potomac
Two-Step, Jack.

829
02:08:50,210 --> 02:08:52,102
I'm sorry,
Mr. President.

830
02:08:52,141 --> 02:08:54,153
I don't dance.

831
02:09:16,077 --> 02:09:18,450
Ryan, have you
got a minute?

832
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:20,018
No.

833
02:09:21,426 --> 02:09:24,162
We need to talk.

834
02:09:24,243 --> 02:09:26,093
Ryan!

835
02:09:49,384 --> 02:09:52,240
The Committee will please
come to order.

836
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:55,378
The Chair will now call
Dr. John Ryan.

837
02:10:14,968 --> 02:10:17,342
Dr. Ryan,
thank you very much

838
