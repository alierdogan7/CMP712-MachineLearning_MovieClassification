1
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,700
Hey, you guys, check this out!

2
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,300
What is that, man?

3
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,100
That's straight Five-O.

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,400
Let me see that.

5
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,900
All right, you ready?

6
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,100
Byzantines fighting side by side
with cowboys and Indians?

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,300
It was an
imaginative
childhood.

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,700
You know, actually,
this garage was once a garage.

9
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
So check it out.
We're deriving

10
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,000
a set of coupled
differential equations

11
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,200
using a fourth order
Runge-Kutta Method.

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,400
You're kidding. Huh.

13
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,300
He's trying
to see how far

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,700
he can fling
a ball of fire.

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,100
Ooh. You know, I think
I liked it better when you,

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,000
uh, lit dead bugs
with a magnifying glass.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,700
Don did that.
Oh.

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,400
Right, yeah.

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,100
All right!

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,300
Bingo!

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,300
Good shot!

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,500
What? Come in.

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,700
Alan Eppes?

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,900
Yeah?

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
Have a nice day.

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,100
What was
all that about?

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,500
Oh, oh. It's a project
that I consulted on.

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,500
Which project?
Kim's Day Night

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,800
Golf Center.

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, that's the
driving range

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,100
in Koreatown, right?
Yeah. The neighbors

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
in the surrounding apartments
have been complaining

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,000
that the, uh,
floodlights are on 24/7.

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,800
Apparently, it's daytime
all night long.

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm being sued.

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,700
What do you see, David?

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,000
Badge traces back
to an LAPD officer

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,400
went missing
in 1990.

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,800
Hmm. Missing how?

40
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,800
Uh, we don't know.
Found the badge
right there.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,800
Officer's name
was John Everett.

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,900
23 years old.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Bureau initially
handled the case

44
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,100
as an unexplained disappearance.

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, well,

46
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,400
this should give it
a new perspective, huh?

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,300
Reports indicate he went missing
wearing his uniform.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,500
It's looking like
a cop killing with
the guy out there

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,700
still walking around.

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
That's Gary Walker
coming up the hill.

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,400
LAPD's gonna work
with us on this one.

52
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,300
So, Lieutenant,
how you doing?

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,100
Seen me on better

54
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,800
Sinclair.

55
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Is this it?

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,900
This is it.

57
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,400
Man who wore this
was the finest young
cop I ever knew.

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,200
You were close
with John Everett?

59
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Yeah.

60
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,200
Everett was on my
street crime team.

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,100
We hit hard and often.

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
Couple of weeks
before he disappeared,

63
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,400
he killed a real hard-ass
gang banger

64
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,700
named Stephon Bradley.

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,500
You think him
gone missing

66
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
was an act of revenge maybe?

67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,500
I don't need to think,
I know, Sinclair.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
His brother vowed
revenge at the time,

69
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,200
and Everett's
car was found

70
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,100
in his
neighborhood.

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,300
What, you couldn't make a case?

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
Not without a body.

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,400
What happened to Bradley?

74
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Did ten years for armed robbery.

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,100
Paroled in '02.

76
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,000
Got a college degree while
he was on the inside, too.

77
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,600
I hear he even writes
a little poetry now.

78
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,800
But all that's about to change.

79
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,100
We got this cop
that disappeared

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,100
but, uh, the thing is, it
happened 17 years ago.

81
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
What can I do?

82
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,700
High rise was supposed
to be built,

83
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,300
but a lawsuit
shut it down.

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,300
And the lot's been
vacant ever since?
Yeah.

85
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,700
This area right here--
that's where the kids found

86
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,300
Officer Everett's badge.

87
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay. A construction site
would be a pretty good place

88
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,800
to hide a body.

89
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,100
Yeah. Crew could bury
over the body without

90
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,100
ever knowing
about it.

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Mm-hmm. Of course,
on the flip side,

92
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,200
doesn't even mean that
there's a body there.

93
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,100
Oh, there's a body.

94
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,800
Trust me, Agent Reeves.

95
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,700
Of course.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I just mean,

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
it's a lot of ground
to cover there.

97
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Charlie?

98
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,200
Um...

99
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,100
laser swath mapping.

100
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, take me back
to school, Professor.

101
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,200
It's a lot like radar.

102
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,900
Instead of sending out

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,400
radio waves,
we're shooting laser pulses,

104
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,400
which will allow me

105
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
to create a
highly accurate,

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,500
3-D, uh, topographical map
of the area.

107
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
And then we look
for abnormal erosion

108
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,300
in the Earth's surface.

109
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,000
See, ground earth is compact
until it's disturbed.

110
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,200
It's like when
you dig a grave.

111
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,700
Right, when
a person's body

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,200
is buried, uh, erosion

113
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,100
and decomposition create
a depression in the earth.

114
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,300
Um, here,
let me take this, um...

115
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,700
this bowl of...

116
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,600
this bowl of popcorn,
for example, and imagine

117
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,200
that this is the earth
under which a body is buried.

118
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,500
And this water
represents

119
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,100
erosion, time...

120
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,600
And there goes my lunch.

121
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,900
See that depression?

122
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
That is what our lasers

123
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,600
are looking for.

124
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
Well, that sounds
real good

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,900
as long as we
locate my man.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,900
See, this isn't just

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,800
an unsolved homicide
for me. I knew John.

128
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,000
I was responsible for hi
as I am for all of my men.

129
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,600
17 years ago,

130
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,500
John's wife had to bury
an empty coffin,

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
and we didn't have the evidence

132
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,100
to take down his killer,
Calvin Bradley.

133
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,600
It's time
to bring Everett home...

134
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
...get this cop killer
off the streets.

135
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:55,801
So, there's Walker's
team back in 1990,

136
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:59,201
and he was married
for three years.

137
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,601
Had a little boy

138
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:03,101
who is now 19 years old.

139
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:03,901
According to Walker,

140
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,601
he and the team stay close
to the family.

141
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:08,301
Yeah, survivor's
guilt probably.

142
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,301
Hey, Liz,

143
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,801
thanks for helping us out.

144
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:13,901
Oh, yeah, no problem.

145
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,101
I was getting tired
of driving around Compton

146
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,701
breaking down
doors anyway.

147
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:19,201
Ooh, gang detail.

148
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:20,001
Mm-hmm.

149
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:21,601
War on drugs knows no end.

150
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:23,801
Anyway, these are the files
you asked for.

151
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,901
Okay, and Calvin Bradley?

152
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,401
He ran with a black gang
known as BSF:

153
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,601
Bixel Street Family.

154
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,401
I asked around.

155
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:34,101
He's actually a bit of a legend.

156
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,101
Yeah? How so?

157
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:37,101
I mean, guy clearly
is no angel, but word now,

158
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:38,901
he's a changed
man, and, uh,

159
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:40,101
runs a program helping kids.

160
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:42,201
And he's been clean
since his brother's death?

161
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:45,201
You mean since Everett's.

162
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:47,701
Uh-huh.

163
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:51,301
Hard to believe

164
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:54,201
we may finally find Everett
after all these years.

165
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:56,201
To think he's been
rotting out there all this time.

166
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,201
While Calvin Bradley's
been walking around

167
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,201
a free man.

168
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:01,201
No thanks
to the FBI.

169
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:02,501
Hey, what? Excuse me?
Let's just

170
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,801
say the Feds didn't put

171
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,201
much manpower on it
at the time.

172
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,001
Look, I wasn't there
at the time, okay?

173
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,701
Hey, listen, this has been
a very tough day

174
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,201
for all of us, but, uh,

175
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:11,401
we're on the
same page now,

176
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,001
and, uh, Eppes
has just come here

177
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,201
to find out what happened the
day that Everett disappeared.

178
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,901
I mean, if there's anything
you remember, you know,

179
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,501
that's come back to you,
you know what I'm after.

180
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:24,701
Night before,

181
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,801
a ten-year-old girl
was killed in a drive-by.

182
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:30,201
Word was a BSF crew had raided
a rival gang's stash house.

183
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,201
What's BSF?

184
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:32,201
Bixel Street
Family.

185
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:33,501
That was Bradley's gang
at the time.

186
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:35,901
Anyway, team had
the day off.

187
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:38,001
Commanders wanted
everyone on it.

188
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,201
Kid gets killed,
politicians want action.

189
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:41,601
Well, you know
how it is.

190
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,301
So I called everybody in.

191
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,501
Everett had some
appointments,

192
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,401
didn't get the
word till late.

193
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:49,101
By the time he rolle
we were all out on the street.

194
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:50,701
That was the last
we heard of him.

195
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,901
What's going on?
I got your call.

196
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,601
Did you find him?
No, no, no,
not yet.

197
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:56,201
Not yet,
not yet.
I don't understand.

198
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,201
Well, some kids...
some kids found his badge.

199
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:00,701
Oh, my God.

200
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:02,001
What am I gonna
tell Kevin?

201
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,701
You just let us talk
to him, all right?

202
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,001
Thanks.

203
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:07,701
Just, uh...

204
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,701
What's that all about?

205
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,001
That's Everett's wife.

206
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,701
She's worried
about their son Kevin.

207
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:15,501
Uh-huh.

208
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,301
We tried to be
like a dad to him.

209
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,001
You can see why

210
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:21,201
we want Calvin Bradley
brought to justice.

211
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:24,601
Charlie, have you seen the...?

212
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,301
Laser Swath Mapping?

213
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,601
Yeah. Are you
familiar with it?

214
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:29,701
I am.

215
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,401
I consulted once with
the Army Corps of Engineers.

216
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:33,301
Oh, my.
They were checking

217
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,801
for coastal erosion
along the Gulf, but this...

218
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:38,101
This looks local.
Well...

219
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:39,401
I'm helping
the FBI

220
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,901
locate a missing police officer.

221
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,301
A missing police officer?

222
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,101
I didn't hear anything
about that

223
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,201
on the news.

224
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,001
Well, it was
back in 1990.

225
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:50,101
Bunch of kids
just recently

226
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:52,201
found his badge
in an empty lot.

227
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:54,301
So, you're looking for...?

228
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,601
His body.
Oh, God.

229
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,101
That-That's an awful thing
to happen.

230
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,101
Yeah.

231
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:00,901
So, um, have you seen Amita?

232
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,301
She was in her office earlier.

233
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,501
She's probably hiding from me.

234
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,801
Why would she be hiding
from you?

235
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:07,301
Oh, well, because she resigned

236
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,401
as the Chair
of the Curriculum Committee.

237
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:12,001
She resigned?

238
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:12,501
Mm-hmm.

239
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:13,601
In an e-mail.

240
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:15,001
Chairing that committee

241
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:16,701
is an incredible opportunity
for her...

242
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:20,901
Hey, Charlie, um,

243
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:23,601
I left your dad
a couple of messages,

244
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,501
and I haven't heard back
from him yet,

245
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:26,201
and I was
wondering if

246
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:30,001
<i>you knew if there's a reason
he's not calling me?</i>

247
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,101
Well, he's being sued.

248
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,201
He's being sued?!

249
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:34,801
Yeah.

250
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:36,301
Apparently, a golf driving range

251
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:40,401
he's been working on has become
an eyesore, literally.

252
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:43,201
Yeah, that's him.

253
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,301
That's Calvin Bradley.

254
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,801
I thought associating
with gang members

255
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,401
was a violation
of his parole?

256
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,901
Oh, he applied to a judge
for an exception.

257
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,101
Claimed he was
rehabilitating them.

258
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:55,901
You guys seem pretty sure

259
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,601
he's the one who
killed Officer Everett.

260
00:09:58,101 --> 00:09:59,301
In 1990,

261
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:02,001
Bradley's bragging to
anybody who will listen,

262
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,501
he's gonna get revenge
on Everett

263
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,501
for killing his brother.

264
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:07,201
Words don't always
mean action.

265
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:08,701
Out there, you
learned real quick

266
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,601
there was no such thing
as an idle threat.

267
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:12,301
I grew up in this
neighborhood, all right?

268
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,701
Half the gang
bangers I busted,

269
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:18,001
I knew, and if they said it,
they did it.

270
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:21,401
We find John Everett's body,
this scumbag's going down.

271
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:27,501
So these are all the spots
I have.

272
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,401
How far down
do they have to dig?

273
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:30,501
Oh, just about...

274
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:32,501
just about four feet or so.

275
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:35,101
You worked that
gang case last year,
developed those, uh...

276
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,201
What are they called?

277
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,201
Shooting chains?

278
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:41,501
Yeah, a, uh, murder leads
to a retaliation,

279
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:44,301
and another and another,
and, yeah, it's a...

280
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:45,601
it's a domino effect, sure.

281
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,301
Any chance you could
do that here?

282
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,401
See if any other slayings

283
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:50,901
connect this cop's death
to Calvin Bradley?

284
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,101
Yeah, it's quite possible.

285
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,101
Where's your brother?

286
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:56,201
Hmm?

287
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:58,201
Oh, he's off
with the LAPD.

288
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:00,601
Does he know that
you're on this case?

289
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,501
No. I haven't had a
chance to tell him.

290
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:05,301
Oh, well, that'll be
a nice surprise for him.

291
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:07,901
You think?

292
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,601
I mean, has he said something
to you?

293
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,301
'Cause, you know, I...
he's just been a little...

294
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:13,501
No, he's...

295
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:15,901
He's been going through
some stuff.

296
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,400
Stuff?

297
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,701
Yeah.

298
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:20,701
I think you should talk
to him about it.

299
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,201
Sure.

300
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:24,001
Agent Warner,
we got something.

301
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,801
C1, just as
I had suspected.

302
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:36,301
It's him. It's Everett.

303
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,101
The Preliminary Coroner's
investigation here

304
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,801
indicates Everett had a single
gunshot wound to the head.

305
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:46,501
Fracturing indicates it was

306
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:48,101
probably at close range.

307
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:50,501
So this was
an execution.

308
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:51,901
Never been any
doubt about that.

309
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,401
Somehow Bradley got his
hands on Everett...

310
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:55,601
walked him to the

311
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:57,801
construction site,
planted one in his dome.

312
00:11:57,901 --> 00:12:00,001
Then he dumped
him in a ditch,

313
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,601
and waited for a
construction crew
to seal his tomb.

314
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,401
Maybe. But can you prove it?

315
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,801
Well, I'm gonna let
Bradley to do that for me.

316
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,601
What makes you think
he's gonna talk to you now?

317
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,101
1990, I didn't
have a body.

318
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:12,901
Bradley knew that.
Now I do.

319
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:29,801
Calvin Bradley, FBI, open up!

320
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:32,401
LAPD. What the
hell's going on?

321
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:39,901
Get off him! Back off!

322
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:44,601
We're done here!

323
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,101
You see me here with no lawyer

324
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,801
because I have nothing to hide.

325
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:55,401
Yeah, why is it you look like
you got something to hide, huh?

326
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:58,401
17 years, nothing changes.

327
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:01,101
And you people wonder why we
don't want to help the cops.

328
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,401
We found him, Calvin.

329
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,001
You know who that is, right?

330
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,101
LAPD officer,
John Everett.

331
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:11,801
Same cop that killed your
little brother 17 years ago.

332
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:13,301
And disappeared two weeks later.

333
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:16,001
I have nothing to do with this.

334
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:17,501
Several witnesses say

335
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:20,301
you threatened
Officer Everett's life.

336
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:22,801
I was young.
I was a hothead.

337
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,801
Said some things
I didn't mean.

338
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,801
Hey, his car was found
a couple hundred feet

339
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:27,701
from your house.

340
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:30,901
Calvin, man, you've spent
more time in a law library
than we have.

341
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,601
You know that car
gives you opportunity

342
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:33,901
and your brother's death,

343
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,201
that gives you motive.

344
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,901
My little brother
was shot down like a dog.

345
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:39,601
Police didn't investigate.

346
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:41,501
You guys didn't care.
Your little brother

347
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,501
was a drug dealer who ran
with one of the most

348
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:45,101
violent gangs in the city.

349
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:47,201
You make it sound like
Stephon had a choice.

350
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:48,601
Like any of us did.

351
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:51,101
Got one choice out there, man:
Live or die.

352
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:52,901
Is that what you told
Officer Everett

353
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,601
when you put a bullet
through his skull?

354
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,501
I've already been to prison
for crimes I committed.

355
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,701
I'm not going back
for one I didn't do.

356
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,101
Life without parole.

357
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:06,101
Okay? That's the
only time you're going
to hear that offer.

358
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:10,001
You people think my brother
got what he deserved.

359
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:12,701
Well...

360
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,701
I think same might
be said for this cop.

361
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:17,901
What was that you said?

362
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,301
All right.
Say that again.

363
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,701
Listen, Gary, come on.
Hey, Gary.

364
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:22,701
Gary, Gary! Hey Gary!

365
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:24,001
All right, all right. Listen.

366
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,201
Down.

367
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:27,001
Could I talk to
you for a second?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.

368
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:33,201
You can't do that
around here, you know?

369
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:34,101
You gotta calm down.

370
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:35,301
Whew. Okay.

371
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,101
He wants to desecrate the
memory of one of my men.

372
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:40,501
You just let me have a piece
of him, I'll get a confession.

373
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:41,801
No, I can't do that.

374
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:42,901
Come on, Eppes,
just take a walk,

375
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,601
go have dinner
or whatever.

376
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:46,001
I understand how you feel.

377
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:46,801
It's not gonna happen,
all right?

378
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,701
Okay, listen.
Before Everett disappeared,

379
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:51,101
he was worried about
retribution.

380
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:52,701
He'd heard things on the street.

381
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:53,901
And we're running that down.

382
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:56,401
Yeah, well, I've been running
it down for 17 years.

383
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:57,701
And now,

384
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:58,901
you have the man.

385
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,701
You have him sitting right here.

386
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,101
The man who killed him.
Now, if you two don't

387
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,501
have the stomach for it--
That's not the case.

388
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,101
All right? We tried.

389
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:07,401
We don't have enough
to hold the guy. Period.

390
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:10,001
Are you setting him free?

391
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,601
Yeah, you bet I'm
setting him loose.

392
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:15,201
Excuse me.

393
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:19,201
Someone's not happy.

394
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:20,501
Bradley called
our bluff.

395
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:22,401
Well, it's about to get
more interesting.

396
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:23,301
The ballistics are in.

397
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:25,701
The bullet that killed
Everett came from a .38.

398
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,501
What? A revolver?
Or a revolver
that was issued

399
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,501
to Everett.
It's his duty weapon.

400
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,701
Same gun that killed
Stephon Bradley.

401
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,301
That means Everett was killed
with his own gun.

402
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,201
yeah.

403
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:46,101
Kevin wouldn't
even remember his dad

404
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:47,501
if it weren't
for those guys.

405
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:51,001
They took him to ball
games, camping trips...

406
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:54,101
How's he holding up?

407
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:57,301
It's been tough...
watching me get through this.

408
00:15:58,001 --> 00:15:58,901
But he's lucky.

409
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,501
He's got four great
surrogate dads.

410
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:04,401
When Lieutenant Walker said
that your husband

411
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:06,101
had some concerns
after shooting

412
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,301
Stephon Bradley.

413
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,501
Uh, that's his way
of saying he was upset.

414
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,201
Case you haven't noticed,
Lieutenant Walker

415
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:14,701
doesn't exactly
express himself well.

416
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:16,801
Emotionally, I mean.

417
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:20,601
Truth is, the shooting
changed my husband.

418
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:24,401
He wasn't prepared for the way
he felt after killing that kid.

419
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,501
Was he depressed?

420
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:27,701
Depressed?
Did he have
trouble eating?

421
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:28,801
Or sleeping?

422
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:31,201
What are you asking me?

423
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:34,501
Well, our forensics indicate
that your husband

424
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:36,201
was killed with his own gun.

425
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,801
You think he killed himself?

426
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,301
No... No, he wouldn't do that.

427
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:49,601
Well, I'm sorry to put you
through this. We just, uh...

428
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,801
we just wanted to be sure.

429
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,901
Walker's got Bradley
tried and convicted.

430
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,401
Yeah, I know, I know.

431
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:05,401
Want some coffee?
No, I'm good.

432
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:09,601
What's going on?

433
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:12,701
Is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah, it's
just some stuff.

434
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,801
You know, I really don't
want to talk about.

435
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:21,701
Talking's not exactly
what I had in mind.

436
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:24,801
Uh, isn't this
sexual harassment?

437
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:26,901
Uh, I'll show you
sexual harassment.

438
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,501
All right. Hey.

439
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,401
I want your
input on that, Eppes.
Yeah.

440
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:34,701
Roger that.

441
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:38,901
That's amazing.

442
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,301
And in 1977,
there were fewer than...

443
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:44,201
500 murders in Los Angeles.

444
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:46,501
And by 1985,
the number doubled.

445
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:48,801
Well, there must be
some sort of causal

446
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,701
explanation for those
statistics.

447
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,901
Yeah, I mean, it was
the introduction of mass

448
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:54,501
drug sales by the gangs,
you know?

449
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:57,301
Fights over street corners--
territories shifting

450
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:58,701
led to more killings.

451
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,401
What?

452
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:09,001
You quit.

453
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,601
What are you talking about?

454
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,401
Chair of the Curriculum
Committee.

455
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:17,701
You know how
huge that is.

456
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:21,201
I can't believe she told you.

457
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,301
You know, neither Larry nor I
were ever asked

458
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,501
to chair that committee.

459
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,201
There's some pretty
heavy hitters, you know.

460
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:27,801
It can be intimidating.

461
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:29,701
I mean, maybe not for you...
Well, I've seen you

462
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:32,001
with the faculty,
you're very good.

463
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:36,601
Some of the professors talk.

464
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,301
About us.
What?!

465
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,301
Well, it doesn't matter.

466
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:41,801
No, just tell me...
What,

467
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:42,801
so that you can protect me?

468
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:45,101
Look, you can't and you
shouldn't have to.

469
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:47,801
I'm just not ready for this.

470
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:54,701
Agent Reeves,

471
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,801
did you mention
something about suicide?

472
00:18:56,901 --> 00:19:00,201
Did you mention to Everett's
wife that he killed himself?

473
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:02,501
No, I never said that.
I know you
didn't say that.

474
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:06,001
But did you say something about,
"Well, was he depressed...?"

475
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,401
Eh, he was depressed,
Lieutenant.

476
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:09,501
Now, you shouldn't...

477
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,501
You really had no
right to do that.

478
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,601
Hold on. Don't come in here
telling us what rights

479
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,601
we do or don't have, Gary.

480
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,001
Now, I understand
how you feel...

481
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:18,701
No, I don't think you
do understand, Eppes.

482
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,101
I don't think understand
how I feel.

483
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,601
I don't think you know what
it's like to living it

484
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:23,901
in the streets,
the way we do.

485
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:25,801
And back then, it was a war.

486
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:28,801
Cops were dying every day,
trying to take back this city.

487
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,301
And Everett was one of them.

488
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,801
Did you know Everett was
killed with his own gun?

489
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:35,401
What?

490
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,301
Yeah, ballistics matched
the bullet to the .38

491
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:39,101
that killed Bradley,
all right? Take a look.

492
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:40,601
I don't need to see that.
What are you talking about?

493
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:43,101
That means that Bradley
got a hold of Everett's gun
and he shot him with it.

494
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,901
So what? The body
was buried, remember?
How did that happen?

495
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,701
I said before, the
construction crew could have

496
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:49,901
buried his body and
not ever knew about it.

497
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,301
What are you doing?
Are you writing

498
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:53,801
Calvin Bradley's
closing argument now?

499
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,701
I knew Everett. He wouldn't
have killed himself.

500
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:00,101
I got something.

501
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,401
The gang case
I worked on last year,

502
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,301
my guiding principle was
their territorial nature.

503
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:08,601
And it turned out some of
these gang members spent

504
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:11,101
their whole lives living
within a 10-block radius.

505
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,701
Their turf.
Right, I remember.

506
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:14,601
They live a mile from
the ocean; some of them

507
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:15,701
have never even
seen it...

508
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:19,701
Right, so here is a map
of all known gang territories

509
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,801
back in 1990 and using the
theory of collective behavior,

510
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,101
I...

511
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:27,901
Lieutenant Walker,
imagine a colony of ants

512
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:29,101
searching for food.

513
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:30,401
They send out a scout

514
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:32,801
and that scout wanders
around randomly.

515
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:35,601
If that scout finds food,
well, then the colony

516
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,401
marks that path as good.

517
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,301
If he doesn't find food, then
that path is marked as neutral.

518
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:42,301
And if that scout
never returns,

519
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:44,301
you better believe that
path is marked as bad.

520
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,901
Same thing
works with gangs.

521
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:48,601
Calvin Bradley was a member
of the Bixel Street Family.

522
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:51,201
This was their territory
back in 1990.

523
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:53,501
Everett's body
was found here

524
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:56,101
in an area controlled
by a gang called

525
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,201
the 18 Street Mexicali.

526
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:02,201
18 Street Mexicali and Bixel
Steet Family were rivals.

527
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:05,001
Factoring in for
territorial gang shifts...

528
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:11,501
I cannot find
a single safe passage.

529
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:12,901
For Bradley to
travel from his turf

530
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:15,801
to a rival's turf to even
have killed Everett.

531
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,301
It would be like a
Sunni going for a ride

532
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,501
in a Shi'ite neighborhood.

533
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:22,001
???

534
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:32,701
So Calvin Bradley

535
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,601
would've had trouble getting to
the crime scene.

536
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,401
Which doesn't make him
innocent...

537
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:40,101
Yeah, Charlie's math is all
about probabilities.

538
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:43,701
So, if he says it's unlikely,
it probably is...

539
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:44,901
Which takes us back
to what?

540
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:45,701
Suicide?

541
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:49,501
Well, what if we just keep
following the probabilities.

542
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,901
Meaning what?

543
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:52,501
Well, if the math says
it's doubtful anyone

544
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:54,001
from a rival gang
would have access

545
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,301
tohe 18 Street
Mexicali territories,

546
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:58,401
that narrows
our suspect list down.

547
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,501
To someone in the 18 Street
Mexicali crew.
Right.

548
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:03,501
I'll talk to Charlie
about running some names.

549
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:09,701
Hey!
What's going on?

550
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:10,401
Whoa!

551
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:11,801
Oh, hi.
Hi, the door was open.

552
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,001
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no.

553
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:14,001
Not at all. Come in.
Good.

554
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:15,801
Thanks. Wow.

555
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,901
What's going on?

556
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,501
I love what you've done
with the room, huh.

557
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:20,201
You do?
Very, uh,
early American

558
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:22,701
interrogation room,
it's nice.

559
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,601
I can see your pores.
You notice, eh?

560
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:25,701
So, so what?

561
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:27,701
Charlie told me about
this whole lawsuit thing.

562
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:29,801
Yeah.
I just wanted to come
give you some moral support.

563
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:31,301
Well, uh, thank you,
I appreciate that,

564
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:33,101
but what I really
need are answers.

565
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:34,501
Yeah, to what?
I've been going

566
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:36,001
over my original calculations.

567
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:37,001
They're absolutely right.

568
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:38,401
I just don't understand

569
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:39,701
what the problem is
with the lighting.

570
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:42,101
I tried to
simulate it here.

571
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:45,401
Angles of incidence, good.

572
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:48,501
You got reflection,
absorption,

573
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:51,301
saturation coefficients.

574
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:54,001
Very impressive,
very impressive, Mr. Eppes.

575
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,701
Now I see where Charlie gets
hiinterest

576
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:56,901
in numbers.
Yeah, well,

577
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,501
I'm afraid there's only
one genius in this family.

578
00:22:58,601 --> 00:22:59,301
Oh, I don't know.

579
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:01,701
Hey, I know, I know Charlie's
busy helping out Don,

580
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:04,301
and if you're interested
I'm available.

581
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,301
To go over your figures.

582
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:09,601
My figures?
Yes.

583
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:11,201
I got it.
Put your head down.

584
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:16,801
What do you say,
Lieutenant?

585
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:21,101
It's happy hour
somewhere, right?

586
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:22,401
Let me get a
club soda.

587
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,401
Club soda.

588
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,401
You know that
I've been trying

589
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:28,101
to pin this on Calvin
Bradley for 17 years.

590
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:29,501
It's a little hard
for me to believe

591
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:30,701
that after all this time

592
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:33,401
I might have been looking
at the wrong guy.

593
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:35,501
Hey, look, it's
not over yet.

594
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,101
Thanks.

595
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:40,001
Well, you'd think that I would
know after all this time

596
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:43,001
that things are never
what they seem.

597
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:44,301
You followed
your gut.

598
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:45,401
There's nothing else you can do.

599
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:48,001
It's a whole different world
out there now, Eppes.

600
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:50,401
It's a whole different way
of policing, a whole new way.

601
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:53,301
Down is up, up is down.

602
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:59,001
Everett wouldn't have
killed himself.

603
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:01,301
That's not the man I knew.

604
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:03,901
So, tell me
about 18 Street guy?

605
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,601
Well, they're not around
anymore, that's one thing.

606
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,401
And they used to be one
of the biggest drug suppliers

607
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,701
on the west coast.
All right.

608
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:12,201
So, if Everett was shot
in their territory,

609
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:13,701
then somebody knows something.

610
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,201
something, right?

611
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:20,701
Yeah.

612
00:24:23,401 --> 00:24:24,201
Hey.

613
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:25,101
How you doing?

614
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,501
Tell me where Jimmy Lopez is?

615
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,201
The other side of this cab.

616
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:37,201
Jimmy Lopez?

617
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:38,401
FBI. I'd like
to talk to you

618
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:39,101
for a minute.

619
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,401
FBI?
Yeah.

620
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,301
Get your hands up.

621
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:43,201
How you doing,
Jimmy?

622
00:24:43,301 --> 00:24:44,701
Officer Walker.

623
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:45,601
You got a good memory.

624
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:47,401
What's, uh...

625
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:48,601
what's going on
here, guys?

626
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:50,001
We thought
we would take a trip

627
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:50,901
down memory lane.

628
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:53,001
Yeah, maybe you didn't hear,
but...

629
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:55,001
I don't snitch no more.

630
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:56,101
right?

631
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:58,101
Well, they found Officer
Everett's body.

632
00:24:58,201 --> 00:24:59,001
Who?

633
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:00,101
Officer John Everett.

634
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,201
Nah, that name don't ring
a bell.

635
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,301
Well, he was
found buried

636
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:09,801
in 18 Street
Mexicali territory,

637
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:11,301
so his name better start ringing
some bells

638
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:12,501
or I'm gonna ring
your bell.

639
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:17,401
I never had nothing
to do with killing no cop.

640
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:18,301
There's no way
he gets shot

641
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:19,101
in your territory

642
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:20,501
and it's not the news
of the decade.

643
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,501
No statute of limitations
on murder, Jimmy.

644
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:23,401
You know that, right?

645
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,701
I heard what everyone else
heard, okay?

646
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:28,501
What's that?

647
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:30,701
The cop was whacked courtesy
of the BSF.

648
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:32,501
Payback for some shooting.

649
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:33,101
So, what's he doing

650
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:34,301
in the 18 Street's territory?

651
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,201
No offense,

652
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:39,201
but when it came
to killing cops,

653
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:42,001
gang bangers can find
some pretty common ground.

654
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:50,001
Oh, hey.
There you are.

655
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:51,701
I went by your office
looking for you.

656
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:52,701
You did?

657
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,901
Yeah, I just wanted to talk.

658
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:56,101
About what?
Mm...

659
00:25:57,001 --> 00:26:00,701
You know, thought about
walking away myself once.

660
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:01,901
You did.

661
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,901
Was first time I orally defended

662
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,101
a dissertation.

663
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:09,201
Charlie Eppes,
not confident about math?

664
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,301
I was more scared
of quitting

665
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:12,901
than I was of going
through with it,

666
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:13,901
so...

667
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,301
I couldn't walk away.

668
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,401
I'm gonna do it.

669
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,601
I'm gonna chair
that committee.
You are?

670
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:22,901
I may make some mistakes...

671
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:23,901
No, you're gonna be great.

672
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:26,001
You're gonna be great.
I'll help you.

673
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:27,501
You know, if you
want my help.

674
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:29,601
I'm not saying that
you need my help.

675
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:31,401
If you want it.

676
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:33,501
I will take all the help
I can get.

677
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:34,601
See that?

678
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:35,601
We're a lot alike.

679
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:36,701
'Cause I'm always

680
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:38,101
asking you
for help.
Yes.

681
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,401
Speaking of help...

682
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,701
I see you're still
after that cop killer.

683
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,101
Yeah.

684
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:47,701
Liz Warner says that
he might be a member

685
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:50,401
of a street gang
called 18 Street Mexicali.

686
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:53,101
But none of the shooting
chains are tracking back

687
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:54,301
to a common shooter.

688
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:56,101
That's right.
What are you thinking?

689
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:58,101
You used collective
behavior theory

690
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,401
to define the path the
killer could have taken.

691
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:03,501
But that's not the
whole the story.

692
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:06,301
You're missing
a variable.

693
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:09,101
The victim.

694
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:13,001
I need to know the path
that Everett was taking as well.

695
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,201
All right, so according to this

696
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,501
18 Street had two
triggers

697
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,101
at the time
of Everett's death.

698
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:19,501
It could still be
anyone in the gang.

699
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:21,001
I hoping your brother's
got an answer.

700
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:22,101
All right,
Charlie, hey,

701
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:24,201
tell me you got a name
for us.
No, no.

702
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:25,101
Something else.

703
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:26,901
Charlie looked at
the timeline of events

704
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:28,201
for Everett on the day
he was killed.

705
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:30,901
And I applied
critical path analysis,

706
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:32,301
which is a mathematical
way of looking

707
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,801
at the most efficient manner
to complete tasks.

708
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:36,801
Imagine you're cooking
a holiday dinner,

709
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:38,601
and you cook it all
at the same time.

710
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:40,701
Well, some of your food's
gonna end up burnt.

711
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,601
Some of your food's
gonna end up cold.

712
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,901
What you need to do,
is prepare and cook

713
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:47,401
each part of the meal
in an effective order

714
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,601
and monitor them simultaneously

715
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,801
so that you serve all hot food
at all the same time.

716
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:55,301
The same concept applies
for Everett.

717
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:58,401
And he changed two appointments
he made that day.

718
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:00,701
All right, I mean,

719
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:02,001
so why's this significant?

720
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:03,401
Because people tend

721
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,701
to schedule meetings
as close to one another

722
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:06,501
as they can.

723
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,601
Schedule them
in a progressive order,

724
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:10,101
if they can.
Kind of like a...

725
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:12,001
math of convenience.

726
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:14,801
But his body and his car were
found a few miles apart.

727
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,801
Meaning that either
Everett was killed

728
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:19,301
where he was found and his car
was moved afterwards or...

729
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:21,801
Or else he drove
to the Bixel Street turf

730
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,101
and was transported

731
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,701
to where we found him
some other way.

732
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:28,501
Thus making one of those
two pieces of data skewed.

733
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:29,901
So...

734
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,901
I ran two different analyses.

735
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:34,801
I gave probability scores
to the areas

736
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:36,901
that Everett was most likely
headed to.

737
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:38,101
Now, this first map,

738
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:40,401
assumes that he was headed
to where his body was found,

739
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:42,401
to the 18 Street
Mexicali territory,

740
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:45,501
making this his most likely
next destination.

741
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,401
All right, and if he drove
to the Bixel turf?

742
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:50,401
Then Everett was most likely
headed here,

743
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:52,501
by a more
efficient path.

744
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,601
Do you see something?

745
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,201
Well, back in 1990,

746
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:02,801
Internal Affairs had their
headquarters right here.

747
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,101
Internal Affairs?

748
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,901
???

749
00:29:13,301 --> 00:29:14,301
Charlie is righting.

750
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,301
Everett was on his way
to Internal Affairs

751
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:17,801
and he was killed
before he got there.

752
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:20,101
Yeah, that ain't
a coincidence-- no way.

753
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:21,901
Okay, so why was he
on his way to IA?

754
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:24,101
Well, Everett shot
Stephon Bradley.

755
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:25,101
Right?
Yeah.

756
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,601
But a shooting board ruled
it as a good kill.

757
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:29,001
Yeah, they did, only IA
was taking another look.

758
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:30,901
Yeah, why's that?

759
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:32,701
Well, three days
before Everett shot him,

760
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:34,001
Stephon Bradley
was picked up

761
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:35,101
by Homicide.

762
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:36,501
He was wanted
for a series of murders.

763
00:29:37,101 --> 00:29:39,301
He was taking down rival
gangs' stash houses

764
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:40,801
and killing everyone inside.

765
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:42,001
And he offered

766
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:44,101
to trade information
against dirty cops.

767
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:45,501
Was he dirty, Gary?

768
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,301
No.

769
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:48,701
I don't believe that.

770
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:50,301
What were the circumstances
of the killing?

771
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:54,901
We got a tip that Bradley had
committed a double murder.

772
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,601
We found him
at his girlfriend's house.

773
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:59,101
Everett covered the back,
Bradley tried to bolt for it.

774
00:29:59,201 --> 00:29:59,901
Everett shot him.

775
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,701
Starting to smell
like a bad kill.

776
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,801
All right, so...

777
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,701
Everett was headed
to Internal Affairs to confess,

778
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:10,401
and he stopped in the BSF
territory on the way.

779
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:11,901
Why?

780
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:13,801
Well, a cop with a
guilty conscience

781
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:16,601
might wanna come
clean to the, uh...

782
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:20,001
the brother of the guy that
he killed before he went to IA.

783
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:22,301
You saying that Everett went
to see Calvin Bradley?

784
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:25,701
Walked into the arms of the one
man who wanted to see him dead.

785
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,101
Calvin.

786
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,101
How many times

787
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:41,201
we gonna go through this,
fellas?
You're wasting our time.

788
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,101
We know you saw Everett
the day he disappeared.

789
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:48,001
Okay, you wanna prove
you're a changed man, Calvin?

790
00:30:48,301 --> 00:30:50,701
How 'bout owning up
to what you did, finally, huh?

791
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:53,301
I did ten years taking
responsibility, Lieutenant.

792
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:54,601
What about you?

793
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:56,001
I hadn't committed
any crimes.

794
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:57,901
No, you had other
people do it for you.

795
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:59,101
Wait, hold on, say what?

796
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:00,401
What's that?

797
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,101
You really want to know?

798
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:03,201
Yeah, I really wanna know.

799
00:31:03,301 --> 00:31:06,101
All right, Everett did
come to see me that day.

800
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:07,701
To apologize.

801
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:09,101
All right, he wanted
me to understand

802
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,901
what had gone down
with Stephon.

803
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:13,201
Only he left
my house alive.

804
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:14,201
You're a liar.

805
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:15,701
And you don't
know any better.

806
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:17,101
All right,
careful, hey.

807
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:17,901
What did Everett
say to you?

808
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,901
16 years I been the suspect

809
00:31:20,101 --> 00:31:21,501
and you want my help.

810
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,601
The cops were giving
Stephon tips

811
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:27,901
on the location of
Mexican dope houses.

812
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:28,801
What?

813
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:29,901
Stephon ripped them off

814
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:31,501
while the cops
looked the other way.

815
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:34,801
Then they killed him when he
wanted to tell the truth.

816
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:37,901
Whatever my
brother was...

817
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:40,001
you were the ones
that made him that way.

818
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:41,301
Can I go now?

819
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:46,501
What do you think, Gary?

820
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,501
Yeah, get out of here.

821
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:50,501
Get out of here.

822
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,801
Yeah, well, you can ask but
I'm not giving you a deposition.

823
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:55,501
No, not until I know more facts.

824
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:57,201
Yeah, come in.

825
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,401
All right, if
that's your position

826
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,501
you can talk to my lawyer.

827
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:01,901
You got it.

828
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:03,501
You know a good lawyer?

829
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:04,701
I do. I know several.

830
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:05,801
Good.
Alan.

831
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:06,601
Geez...

832
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:07,801
Come here.

833
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:08,401
Huh?

834
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:09,901
Come here. Come.

835
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,401
Relax. Here. Sit.

836
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:14,501
No, it's all right, breathe.

837
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:16,801
Relax.

838
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:17,801
All right,
it's gonna be fine.

839
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:18,701
All right,
we are gonna tackle

840
00:32:18,801 --> 00:32:20,901
each problem, one at a time.

841
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,001
Albert Einstein said that?

842
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:24,601
No, I read it on the back
of an iced tea bottle.

843
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:26,501
Oh.
It still applies.

844
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:28,701
You know what I did?

845
00:32:29,101 --> 00:32:32,701
I simulated your design
on the CAD program at CalSci.

846
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:37,101
Well, I thought things like this
were, uh, frowned upon

847
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:38,701
by certain administrators.

848
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:39,901
Yeah, so I'm busted.

849
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,401
But who's gonna tell on me?
Me?

850
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,301
Well, if that
million-dollar computer

851
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,201
of yours is, uh, correct...

852
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:50,601
There's no way that that
driving range can be as bright

853
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:52,101
as the plaintiffs claim it is.

854
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:53,201
I know, but the measure
of foot-candles

855
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:54,801
is just off the charts.

856
00:32:54,901 --> 00:32:56,501
So, I, it, it...

857
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:57,201
it doesn't...

858
00:32:59,101 --> 00:33:00,401
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

859
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:02,301
I know what this means.

860
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:04,401
The hue of the
polypropylene is wrong.

861
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,601
They didn't use the synthetic
grass that I specified.

862
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,701
The contractor uses
a cheaper material

863
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:10,201
which reflects...
Which reflects more light!

864
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:11,501
See?!

865
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,101
Well, I'm off the hook.
Yeah.

866
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,001
Except for you electric bill's
gonna go through the roof.

867
00:33:17,101 --> 00:33:18,301
Oh, that's all right.

868
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:20,001
Charlie owns the place now.

869
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,301
So the police were
using Stephon Bradley

870
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:28,001
to take down Mexican drug gangs?

871
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:29,601
No way Everett was
a part of that.

872
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:31,301
Then why did Everett
go see Bradley's brother

873
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:33,001
to apologize?
Easy.

874
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:34,801
Just saying, how long
we gonna live in denial here?

875
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:36,401
Okay, well,
let's look at

876
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:37,401
what Bradley's saying.

877
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:39,601
If what he's saying is true,
then someone had to be

878
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:41,201
telling the cops
where the locations

879
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,001
for these houses were
to begin with, right?

880
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:44,501
Well, if we find that source...

881
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:46,701
Maybe he can point us in the
direction of Everett's killer.

882
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:48,201
Okay, so let's take a look.

883
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:49,901
These are
the gang territories

884
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:51,301
where Calvin Bradley's
brother ripped off

885
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:52,901
those drug houses,
and they're spread

886
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:55,101
all through Mexican
gang territory,

887
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,301
except for one.

888
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,701
18 Street Mexicali.

889
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:00,901
Which is
the same territory

890
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:02,201
where Everett's body
was found.

891
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:04,101
Okay, so why'd these guys
get a free ride?

892
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:06,501
What it means

893
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:07,901
is that whoever
was feeding them

894
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:10,001
information was
18 Street Mexicali.

895
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:11,301
And he didn't want
to snitch on his...

896
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:13,001
on his own gang.

897
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,001
Jimmy Lopez.

898
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,301
Where's Jimmy Lopez?

899
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:27,401
I wish you
could tell me.

900
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:29,101
Took off. Haven't seen him.

901
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,201
Where's his rig?

902
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,201
Around the corner.

903
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:41,001
That's it.

904
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,301
That's wierd.

905
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:14,401
Jimmy Lopez.

906
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:18,401
Been keeping a secret
from me for 17 years.

907
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:34,601
Just doesn't add up.

908
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:36,401
Lopez was clean for years.

909
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,201
You think the pressure
of being questioned by you guys

910
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:40,401
pushed him over the edge?

911
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:41,501
Or someone else did.

912
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:43,301
The tip of the needle is
broken off in his arm.

913
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:44,701
Really?

914
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:45,901
Like he fought back?

915
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:49,701
Toxicology report shows
a mixture of heroin, strychnine

916
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:52,801
and powdered milk.
Nice little cocktail.

917
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,601
What are you thinking?

918
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,401
Most drug dealers,
they're very consistent

919
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:56,601
in the way they cut their drugs.

920
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,101
That's true--
signature,

921
00:35:58,201 --> 00:35:59,701
brand-- helps them
sell it on the street.

922
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:01,201
Maybe we get
a tox report

923
00:36:01,301 --> 00:36:03,701
from Lopez's OD
over to Charlie.

924
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:05,201
He can compare
the drugs

925
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:06,501
in Lopez's system

926
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,601
to the other ODs
in the coroner's database?

927
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:09,701
Sure, go for it.

928
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:10,601
It's worth a shot, right?

929
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,001
Statistical
identification?

930
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:21,401
Right.

931
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:24,401
Just looking at toxicology
records of recent ODs.

932
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:25,701
I'm trying to match

933
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,001
a specific drug
combo to a dealer.

934
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:31,001
Strychnine-- that's poison.

935
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,201
It's a trace dose.

936
00:36:32,301 --> 00:36:33,001
It's not enough to kill.

937
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:35,401
You know, dealers put it
in their heroin mixes.

938
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:36,701
Poison plus heroin.

939
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:39,801
Yeah. A witness who identified
our cop killer OD'd,

940
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,201
so I'm just trying to
trace the drug supply.

941
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,001
What's happening
with the committee?

942
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:50,501
Some of the faculty
are demanding, but...

943
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:52,801
I think I'm up for the job.

944
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:53,801
I never doubted it.

945
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:55,301
What are you working on?

946
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:56,801
Uh, Millie has me
working on

947
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:59,901
some cluster analysis using
autocorrelation techniques

948
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:02,701
to analyze the most effective
undergrad classes

949
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:04,101
in the past two years.

950
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,601
Even going through
the past two semesters

951
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:07,901
would be a ton of work.

952
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:09,701
Yeah.

953
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:11,001
Millie thinks there's
as much to be learned

954
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:12,901
from the old curriculum
as the current.

955
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,701
What is it?

956
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:19,801
You know what?

957
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:21,001
Can we talk later?

958
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:22,301
I got to go.
Okay.

959
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:24,901
We got LAPD looking up
all his known associates.

960
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:29,301
against all the recent ODs
in the coroner's office, right?

961
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:30,001
Yeah, and?

962
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,501
There were no matches
to any current dealers,

963
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:33,201
which is why I re-ran
every overdose

964
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:34,601
in the Coroner's
database,

965
00:37:34,701 --> 00:37:37,101
including old overdoses,
and I got a hit--

966
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:38,701
several hits,
actually.

967
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:40,101
Three overdoses going back

968
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:42,001
over a year,
all tracing back

969
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:44,501
to a drug dealer
named Hector Osorio.

970
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:49,001
Uh, Osorio was busted

971
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:51,501
by Lieutenant Davidson's
narco team.

972
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:53,001
A large quantity

973
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:54,301
of drugs were seized.

974
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:58,201
Which would be
in the evidence room.

975
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:01,701
And who would have
access to those drugs?

976
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:07,701
The lead detective of the team.

977
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:09,701
My guy Davidson.

978
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:15,801
Hey, Walker, what's up?

979
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:17,601
You guys got any news?

980
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:20,101
What the hell's wrong with you?

981
00:38:21,101 --> 00:38:22,001
All right, all right!

982
00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:23,101
You're under arrest for
the murder of

983
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,601
John Everett.
What are you
talking about?

984
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:27,901
They traced the drugs
in Lopez's system to a bust

985
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:30,101
that your team made, huh?

986
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:30,801
So what?

987
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:33,801
Yeah, that means that you
poisoned Lopez with those drugs.

988
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:35,501
Tell me the truth.
You got nothing.

989
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:36,501
You don't got jack on me.

990
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:40,201
How could you do that?!
All right, get off!

991
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:41,701
You ate at
Everett's table!
Hey!

992
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,501
You helped raise
his son!

993
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,001
Gary, cut it out!
Back off!

994
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:46,001
This isn't helping! Turn around!

995
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:47,001
Get your hands
behind your back!

996
00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:47,801
We never took a dime.

997
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:49,701
I made the
streets safer.

998
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:51,701
Every drug dealer that
Bradley whacked...

999
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:52,801
I don't believe you!
No!

1000
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:54,601
Not one drug dealer
Bradley whacked

1001
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,301
ever killed another kid
with junk!

1002
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:57,301
You got that?!

1003
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,501
I made the streets safer!
So when Everett

1004
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,101
was about to rat you out,
you killed him.

1005
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:02,401
Because he had it coming!

1006
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:03,701
You set him up
All right, all right.

1007
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:04,401
to take the shot.

1008
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:05,701
Let me just see him
for one second.

1009
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,101
He was gonna go to IA!

1010
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:08,501
Let me just...
Give me that.

1011
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:09,501
Get this piece of
crap away from me.

1012
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:12,201
He wouldn't listen
to reason! Hey, Walker!

1013
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:14,401
Walker, I had no choice!

1014
00:39:22,101 --> 00:39:23,301
Hey, Dad.

1015
00:39:23,401 --> 00:39:24,101
Hey, Charlie.

1016
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:25,301
What?

1017
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:26,701
No plans with Amita tonight?

1018
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:29,101
She's busy
chairing a new committee.

1019
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,401
I guess...

1020
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:33,401
Millie found
the magic bullet, huh?

1021
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,501
Yeah, they dropped me
from the lawsuit.

1022
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:37,301
Contractor's
on the hot seat now.

1023
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:39,001
Oh, good. Well, I'm glad
she could help.

1024
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:41,701
You know, if you would've
needed my help,

1025
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:43,701
I certainly would've
been there for you.

1026
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:44,801
Oh, yeah, I
know, I know.

1027
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:47,501
Oh, by the way, Charlie,
when I hooked up

1028
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:49,901
all these lights, I may have
blown a circuit or two.

1029
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,101
A circuit or two?

1030
00:39:51,201 --> 00:39:51,601
Where?
Yeah.

1031
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:52,301
I hope you had
the system

1032
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:53,901
backed up with
that laptop of yours

1033
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:54,801
in the garage.

1034
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,201
Ah-ah-ah!

1035
00:39:58,001 --> 00:39:59,301
I was just kidding.

1036
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:11,401
Hey.

1037
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:12,801
So...

1038
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:14,601
what's going on?

1039
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:17,301
I'm worried
about you.

1040
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:18,801
Ah, I'm all right.

1041
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:20,401
I mean, you know,

1042
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,201
did I do something to...
No, no, no.

1043
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:24,001
Liz, it's not about you.

1044
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:25,701
I mean...
Okay.

1045
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,701
You can't just get me going
and disappear.

1046
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:31,301
Yeah, I know.
I just...

1047
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:32,201
I feel like

1048
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:35,201
I keep second-guessing
so many moves.

1049
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:36,601
Mid-life crisis, huh?

1050
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,601
Ha, ha.

1051
00:40:41,101 --> 00:40:42,801
Anyone see you come in here?

1052
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:45,001
Listen to you.

1053
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:17,701
Hey.

1054
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:22,201
Hey.

1055
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:25,801
I got plenty
in the bottle here.

1056
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:27,901
I can see that.

1057
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:29,601
300 bucks.

1058
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,701
Thought he'd
appreciate it.

1059
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:35,601
Gary, there was nothing
you could have done.

1060
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,101
I mean, look, I know that

1061
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:38,701
and you know that.

1062
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:41,301
We'd both be lying to ourselves
if we said that, Eppes.

1063
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,801
17 years.

1064
00:41:46,201 --> 00:41:48,501
It was right there
under my nose.

1065
00:41:50,201 --> 00:41:51,701
I just couldn't see it.

1066
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:56,601
He was a funny kid.

1067
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:59,601
He always walked around with
this goofy grin.

1068
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:01,801
I remember he had

1069
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:04,201
this little red radio
that he used to play,

1070
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:08,101
and there was one song that
he really liked to listen to,

1071
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:09,301
and I...

1072
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:12,001
I just haven't been able
to remember that song.

1073
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:15,001
I wish I could
remember that song.

1074
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,201
Wasn't it you that said,
"At the end of the day,

1075
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:19,701
you go home safe,
that's all you can ask"?

1076
00:42:20,401 --> 00:42:21,401
That's right, Eppes.

1077
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:22,201
You...

1078
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:25,101
You walk away...

1079
00:42:26,101 --> 00:42:27,301
it all works out.
