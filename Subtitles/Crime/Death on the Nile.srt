1
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:55,596
Hey!

2
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,442
It's her. The Ridgeway girl.

3
00:02:58,443 --> 00:02:59,763
Nice.

4
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:01,919
Some of us have to
work for a living.

5
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:20,848
Daisy!

6
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:22,720
Back in the line.

7
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,697
Welcome to Wode Hall,
Miss Ridgeway.

8
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:59,678
We all hope you will
be very happy here.

9
00:03:59,963 --> 00:04:02,430
Thank you, Barnstaple.
I know I shall.

10
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,086
Perhaps, you would care
to meet the staff, Miss?

11
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:07,229
Later.

12
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,329
I want to see what progress
we've made with the grounds.

13
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,431
The architect
isn't here yet, Miss.

14
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,645
Now, Barnstaple.

15
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,058
Very good, Miss.

16
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:26,603
Jackie!

17
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:27,887
Linnet!

18
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:30,298
- Jackie!
- Oh, Linnie!

19
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,182
I'm sorry.

20
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:36,458
- That fool of a butler didn't tell me.
- Oh, no, no. It's all right, it's all right.

21
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,967
- You look marvellous.
- Thank you. So do you, as always.

22
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,093
Where should I serve
the tea, Mademoiselle?

23
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:44,620
- Put it in the drawing room.
- Oui, Mademoiselle.

24
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,199
Let's go upstairs
and freshen up.

25
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,940
What's the matter with Louise?

26
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:50,160
Man trouble, what else?

27
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:54,100
She wants to get married,
to an Egyptian no less.

28
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,812
She knew absolutely nothing about
him, so I had him checked out.

29
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:00,217
- And?
- He had a wife already.

30
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,956
- So you put a stop to it.
- You bet I did.

31
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:07,135
I told her she couldn't look to me for a dowry,
and naturally he wouldn't touch her without one.

32
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:08,219
Men!

33
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,394
Oh, Linnet!

34
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:13,005
Oh!

35
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,113
- It's beautiful!
- I'm so glad you like it.

36
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,382
Listen, Linnet. I've got something
to tell you, and a favour to ask.

37
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:22,044
- Well, anything, you know that.
- No, no. This is serious.

38
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:24,955
- I'm engaged.
- Jackie!

39
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,971
Oh, it's wonderful!

40
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:29,024
- Will you give him a job?
- A job.

41
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:31,043
Here, at Wode Hall. Please.

42
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:34,591
Don't you think you should tell
me something about him, first?

43
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,566
Well, his name is Simon,
Simon Doyle, and he is...

44
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:42,842
oh, he's everything
I've ever dreamed of.

45
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:44,678
Jackie...

46
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,854
- Isn't it lovely?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

47
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:50,415
- Yes, it is, isn't it?
- The trouble is he's broke.

48
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,024
That makes two of us.

49
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,419
These shoes are killing me.

50
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,456
But he loves the country, and a
job here would be just ideal.

51
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:00,890
Oh, Linnet, I'll die
if I can't marry him.

52
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:03,290
I really will, I'll just die.

53
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,869
- You have got it badly.
- I know.

54
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,159
All right.
What do you want me to do?

55
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,472
Well, you've got this huge place.
You're going to need someone to run it for you.

56
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:15,161
- Simon!
- But I need someone with experience.

57
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:18,920
No, listen! He studied Estate Management
at Cambridge. He's very bright.

58
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,562
I'll tell you what, if you don't
like him, you can fire him.

59
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:23,958
But you will, I know you will.

60
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:27,304
All right. Why don't you
bring him down tomorrow?

61
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,556
- And I'll have a look at him.
- Thank you.

62
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:32,553
- Jackie!
- Bye-bye!

63
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,759
I just don't want
to feel a fool.

64
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,125
Don't worry. Linnet promised.

65
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:45,007
Well, almost.

66
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,552
I think Linnet may
not even like me.

67
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:49,947
Nonsense. She'll adore you!

68
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:53,462
And you're perfect for the job.
Perfect.

69
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:56,043
Well, I'll do my best
not to let you down.

70
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:58,825
Oh, Simon, I do love you.

71
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:01,148
You make me so happy!

72
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,756
- We'll honeymoon in Egypt.
- You always said we'd go to Egypt.

73
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:29,960
Hello!

74
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:31,626
Linnet!

75
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,790
Oh, Linnie. Here he is.

76
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,184
- Come on.
- Hold on, darling.

77
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:37,542
Here he is.

78
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,464
My Simon.

79
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Hello.

80
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:48,294
Jackie's told me
so much about you.

81
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:51,328
Isn't he perfect?
Isn't he, Linny?

82
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:56,822
Yes, I think he'll
do very well.

83
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:04,874
I told you.

84
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:22,356
Linnet Ridgeway marries penniless Prince
Charming after whirlwind romance!

85
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:25,561
They plan to honeymoon in Egypt.
Jesus H. Christ!

86
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:27,989
Don't you mean Tut-Ankh-Amon?

87
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,011
Well, what the hell do we do?

88
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:35,635
The Bremen sails tonight.
I can just get on.

89
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,185
What, and try fixing
those British lawyers?

90
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:40,721
- No, you dolt.
- Then what?

91
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,927
I'll go to Egypt. Hell, she's
gonna be there for a month.

92
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:48,027
"Why, uncle Andrew!"

93
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,265
A chance meeting.
I'm over there on a trip.

94
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:54,472
Honeymoon lovers, she's not
thinking too clear, ...

95
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:56,002
Get the picture?

96
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,442
Look, Linnet's no
fool, Pennington.

97
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,857
Neither am I!

98
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:11,644
Well, you have a nice trip,
wicked uncle Andrew.

99
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:16,219
So that's the Ridgeway girl.

100
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,962
What are you
studying so closely?

101
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:20,731
Her picture...?

102
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,447
Or her pearls?

103
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:27,329
Keep a civil tongue in your head,
Bowers, or you'll be out of a job.

104
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,195
What do I care?

105
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:34,907
This town is filled with rich old widows
willing to pay for a little grovelling...

106
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:38,134
and a body massage.
You go ahead and fire me.

107
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,328
Temper, temper, Bowers!

108
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,773
It's obvious you need a holiday.

109
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:49,680
How would a little trip
down the Nile suit you?

110
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,802
There's nothing I
would dislike more.

111
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:56,031
There's two things in the world I
can't abide: It's heat and heathens.

112
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:58,247
Good, then we'll go.

113
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,669
Bowers, pack!

114
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,883
Why don't they put an
escalator in these things?

115
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,589
- Lazybones!
- Lazybones?

116
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,360
Don't you know it's better to
travel hopefully than to arrive?

117
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:53,641
What a view!

118
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:57,510
Happy, darling?

119
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:01,187
Silly! We must be the
happiest people alive.

120
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:03,349
And the prettiest.

121
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,002
- And the luckiest.
- And the alonest.

122
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:08,274
Just us and no one else.

123
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:15,961
The Neter-Menkewre pyramid is 204 feet high.

124
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:19,183
Each side of the base is
356 and one half feet.

125
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:22,105
- Jackie!
- What the hell are you doing here?

126
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,337
Seeing the sights,
like yourselves.

127
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:32,019
But you were at the Danielli
in Venice and at Brindisi too.

128
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,206
What a coincidence!

129
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:39,609
- Jackie, why?
- She's following us about, deliberately.

130
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,527
Is that true?
Well, it's intolerable!

131
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:44,307
And common.

132
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:46,250
Very, very common.

133
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:47,971
And effective.

134
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:50,256
Very, very effective.

135
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,892
Bye-bye.

136
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,927
- Bitch! Everywhere we go she pops up.
- Darling...

137
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:47,104
- Like some kangaroo in heat.
- Oh, I can't understand it.

138
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:50,591
- Can't you?
- Oh, I suppose it's my fault.

139
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,161
I broke our engagement
and went off with you.

140
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:55,489
She must be really unhappy.

141
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,002
- She's revelling in every minute of it.
- No.

142
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,954
Darling.

143
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:08,175
We are the lucky ones.
Don't let Jackie spoil it.

144
00:14:10,622 --> 00:14:11,758
I won't.

145
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,584
This is the perfect honeymoon.

146
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:17,178
No one's gonna wreck it for us.

147
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:20,905
I love you.

148
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:27,308
I'll race you back.

149
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:44,111
- Colonel Race!
- Poirot!

150
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:46,089
Oh, I'm enchanted to see you!

151
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,010
- Oh, my old friend! How capital, how capital!
- Yes.

152
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:51,209
Oh, I haven't clapped
eyes on you since...

153
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,382
oh, that strange affair of
the decapitated clergyman.

154
00:15:55,383 --> 00:15:58,442
I still think you were a trifle lucky to find
that cake knife up the chimney like that.

155
00:15:58,462 --> 00:15:59,420
Lucky?

156
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:02,114
With me it's the exercise
of the little gray cells.

157
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:04,331
Luck, I leave to the others.

158
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,036
Yes, I've forgotten your
opinions about yourself.

159
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:09,710
Might one ask, what
are you doing here?

160
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:11,316
I'm on "les vacances".

161
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:14,198
Shortly I'm going up the
Nile on the steamer.

162
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,506
- And you?
- Oh, the same, oddly enough.

163
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:19,670
Oh. In other words, you're
following one of the passengers.

164
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,300
No, no. "Seulement les
vacances, mon ami."

165
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:26,689
- Like yourself.
- Yes.

166
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,609
This... chair is free, eh?

167
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,297
In this world, comrade,
nothing's free.

168
00:16:36,298 --> 00:16:39,214
- Bitte?
- Forget it. Sit down.

169
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:44,028
- Thanks. You are reading "Das Kapital"?
- I never travel without it.

170
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,252
Dr. Ludwig Bessner.

171
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:49,972
Of the Bessner
Institute, Zurich.

172
00:16:50,184 --> 00:16:52,817
Jim Ferguson, citizen
of the world.

173
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:57,799
- You... are on holidays perhaps, ah?
- No.

174
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,416
I'm observing the decline of the
capitalist system, my friend.

175
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:03,389
Oh, indeed.

176
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:08,744
Well, you've got a good
specimen there, eh?

177
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:10,809
The young Kagumi heiress.

178
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,396
That parasite!

179
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,309
- You don't approve?
- She makes me sick.

180
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:17,749
In any decent society...

181
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:21,711
Eh... ah, you may be right.

182
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:25,249
She has all together
too much power.

183
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,271
- Sir...
- Oh, "Thank you".

184
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,174
Chin-chin!

185
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,277
Linnet!

186
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:42,330
- Linnet, honey!
- Uncle Andrew!

187
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:45,498
What a surprise! I didn't know
you were travelling in Egypt!

188
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,335
Well, it's very sudden.

189
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,986
As a matter of fact,
I'm on my honeymoon.

190
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,073
Your honeymoon?

191
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:55,196
What do you know!
Is this the lucky young man?

192
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:58,714
Darling, this is my American lawyer
and trustee, Andrew Pennington.

193
00:17:58,715 --> 00:18:00,734
Simon. Simon Doyle.

194
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:02,787
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- How do you do?

195
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:05,255
- Won't you join us?
- Well, just for a moment.

196
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:08,391
But don't worry.
I'm not going to intrude.

197
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:11,202
I know how young people are.

198
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,466
The centre of scene of all eyes.

199
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,324
Even you, with your
English reserve, gaze.

200
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:20,463
- She's very beautiful.
- Oh, she's very rich.

201
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:21,849
You know who she is, of course.

202
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,101
- Of course.
- Yes.

203
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,945
Do forgive me for butting in,

204
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:27,240
but I have a bet with
my daughter here,

205
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:30,794
that you are Hercules Porridge,
the famous French sleuth.

206
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:34,615
Not quite, I am Hercule Poirot,
the famous Belgian sleuth.

207
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:37,682
I told you, Rosalie.

208
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,532
There's only one Monsieur
Poirot in the world.

209
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,174
He's unmistakable.

210
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:45,020
As indeed I realize I am myself.

211
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:47,779
My mother is Salome
Otterbourne, the novelist.

212
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,014
Otter... Salo..., of course.

213
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,764
Enchanté.

214
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:55,199
So here we are, two famous
people in one place.

215
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,823
Oh, three, surely.

216
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:02,715
I was talking about genius,
not mere money, Monsieur.

217
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,649
Oh, you know Colonel
Race, my old friend?

218
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:09,625
This is... and her daughter...

219
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,461
Charmed, simply charmed.

220
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:14,287
Please, you sit down,
Madame, Mademoiselle.

221
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,262
You're probably working on
some other book now, Madame.

222
00:19:20,263 --> 00:19:22,464
Set in Egypt, perhaps?

223
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:26,447
How thrillingly clever of you to
deduce that, Monsieur Porridge!

224
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:29,588
I am here to absorb
local colour...

225
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:33,735
for my grand opus,"Snow
on the Sphinx's Face".

226
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,699
Frozen enigma turns
to incandescent love

227
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,768
as this young English girl from Hazel
Mills, scarcely out of school,

228
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:46,291
melts the barbarous heart
of a cruel desert sheik.

229
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:48,125
Somehow, I don't think
Monsieur Poirot

230
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,916
is a very keen reader of
romantic novels, Mother.

231
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,672
Of course he is,
all Frenchmen are.

232
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:56,421
They're not afraid
of good, strong sex!

233
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,830
Unlike, I might say, most of our
leading lending libraries.

234
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,840
They have banned Salome Otterbourne
for speaking the truth

235
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:06,712
about men and women.

236
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:09,042
But she goes on, nonetheless.

237
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,848
The truth, yes. The truth.
It's so difficult to tell.

238
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,004
Thank you, Monsieur.

239
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,350
Well, perhaps you would
join me in a tango, ...

240
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:26,338
Mademoiselle?

241
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,435
A little...

242
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,139
exercise after dinner.

243
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:36,566
Do you tango, Colonel?

244
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,186
- Poorly, I'm afraid, Miss Otterbourne.
- Then I shall teach you to do it right.

245
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:43,414
As it was done in old Spain, when
it was known as the "cheeker",

246
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:46,524
that is to say, with a
sensuous, erotic dash.

247
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:45,981
Damn it, Jackie!
Can't you leave us alone?

248
00:21:49,826 --> 00:21:50,944
Waiter.

249
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:12,767
Monsieur Poirot!

250
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,227
Monsieur Poirot!

251
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:41,707
I saw you with
Linnet this morning.

252
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,552
How much is she paying
you to warn me off?

253
00:22:43,553 --> 00:22:46,891
No, no. I accepted no commission
from Madame Doyle, nor will I.

254
00:22:46,892 --> 00:22:49,093
What I have to say to you
is in pure friendship.

255
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:52,302
Ah, yes?
And what would you like to say?

256
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:56,851
That I'm making a public show of myself?
That I'm crazy?

257
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:58,997
I say bury the dead.

258
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:01,817
Not as the Egyptians do,

259
00:23:01,818 --> 00:23:03,246
conserving the body

260
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:06,132
in order to ensure the
immortality of the soul. No.

261
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:09,411
Properly, finally.
Turn your back on the past.

262
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:11,194
Look only forward.

263
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:15,428
Remember, time heals everything.

264
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,500
If you think I'm suffering,
you're quite wrong.

265
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,859
Actually, I'm rather
enjoying myself.

266
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:26,140
Yes. Your pleasure is the very
worst part of it, Mademoiselle.

267
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:28,632
I don't care.

268
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:32,957
Simon was mine and he loved me.
Then she came along and...

269
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,747
It's only a tiny thing...

270
00:23:42,117 --> 00:23:43,397
but it's lethal.

271
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:47,045
And my father taught
me to be a crack shot.

272
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:51,363
Sometimes, ...

273
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:55,815
I swear I'll put this gun
right against her head,

274
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:58,216
and then ever so gently

275
00:23:58,851 --> 00:23:59,919
pull the trigger.

276
00:24:03,047 --> 00:24:05,705
When I hear that sound
more and more...

277
00:24:07,277 --> 00:24:09,387
I know how you feel.

278
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,678
We all feel like that at times.

279
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:15,171
Only I warn you, Mademoiselle...

280
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:20,620
Do not allow evil into your heart.
It will make a home there.

281
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:27,358
If love can't live there,
evil will do just as well.

282
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:30,758
Oh. How...

283
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:33,453
How sad, Mademoiselle.

284
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:46,545
Hello, Mr. P.

285
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:49,991
- You're going back to the hotel?
- Where else?

286
00:24:49,992 --> 00:24:53,122
Look. It's a surprise for Linnet.
Do you think she'll like it?

287
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:55,032
That depends. Does she smoke?

288
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:56,803
Just Craven "A".

289
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:58,753
By the way...

290
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:00,634
Have you had a chance
to talk to Jackie yet?

291
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:02,546
Yes, just a few moments ago.

292
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:05,466
Well, good. I hope you got
her to see some sense.

293
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:09,651
Alas, to her, sense is
perpetual revenge.

294
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:11,320
Are you serious?

295
00:25:11,434 --> 00:25:13,852
I'm always serious, mon ami.

296
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:17,648
Jackie's stubborn, I know,

297
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,881
and damn possessive.

298
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,662
- But surely...
- Did she want to possess you?

299
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:24,333
Well, I suppose so.

300
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:25,616
Yes, she did.

301
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:27,928
But she has a hell of a temper
and a mind of her own.

302
00:25:27,948 --> 00:25:30,191
She wishes to wear the trousers.

303
00:25:30,192 --> 00:25:33,208
Yes. And a man can't
have that, can he Mr. P.?

304
00:25:33,228 --> 00:25:35,149
No, no, ne peut pas.

305
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,353
You know, when I first
met Linnet, ...

306
00:25:38,354 --> 00:25:40,261
well, how should I put it?

307
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:44,050
It was like the moon after sunrise.
You just don't notice it's there any more.

308
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:46,975
After I met her, Jackie
just didn't exist.

309
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:49,696
Yes. Some women have that power.

310
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:52,409
But how are you going to find a
way out of your present dilemma?

311
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,853
Well, I have the most marvellous
plan and it's absolutely foolproof.

312
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:09,140
Cabby!

313
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:13,634
The Railway Station, quickly.
We're late for the Alexandria train.

314
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:32,170
To the Railway Station.

315
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:35,027
Fast as you can.

316
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,124
Haare ka!

317
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:56,090
Thank you.

318
00:27:58,192 --> 00:27:59,532
Look. There she is.

319
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,734
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

320
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:17,369
Welcome aboard the Karnak.

321
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:18,355
Yes.

322
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:22,812
My name is Mr. Choudry.
I'm the manager of this boat

323
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:24,828
and your delight and happiness

324
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:28,439
is my sole concern and pleasure.
Quite rightly.

325
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:31,927
I have here... I have here...

326
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:33,885
Yes, I have here a list of...

327
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,902
names and... and...

328
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,120
staterooms.

329
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,171
I guess from your faces

330
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:41,981
which is which, okay?

331
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,480
You are Mrs. and
Miss Otterbourne.

332
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:49,247
- Righty?
- Wrongy.

333
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:51,055
I'm Mrs. Van Schuyler

334
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:54,502
and I wish to be taken
to my cabin immediately.

335
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:58,326
Bowers will have the cabin
opposite, on the starboard side.

336
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:05,210
The roasting afternoon sun may do wonders
for those jaundiced jowls of hers.

337
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,139
Right away, Madam. Right away.

338
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,069
Yes. You must be Dr. Bessner.

339
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,387
Such elegant German moustaches.

340
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:17,118
I'm afraid you'd never make
a detective, Monsieur.

341
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,262
The moustaches, although
undeniably elegant, are Belgian.

342
00:29:21,263 --> 00:29:22,934
My name is Poirot,

343
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:24,878
Hercule Poirot.

344
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:28,355
Ah, the famous Monsieur Poirot?

345
00:29:28,356 --> 00:29:31,543
I grovel in mortification.
I grovel.

346
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,866
Look, wouldn't it just be simpler
for us to give you our names...

347
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:37,321
and you to give us the
cabins that we booked.

348
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:39,977
Simpler? Ah, lummy! Yes.

349
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:43,079
Unquestionably simpler.
Unquestionably.

350
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,616
Such a brilliant lack
of complication.

351
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:49,968
In a trice, the seafraring will
conduct you all to your stateroom.

352
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:51,212
Seafraring!

353
00:29:51,408 --> 00:29:52,900
"Seafra...!

354
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:56,116
Ah, we start.

355
00:29:56,388 --> 00:30:00,572
May I suggest that you all take
your last look at the city?

356
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,225
Seafra...!

357
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,530
Seafraring!

358
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:34,379
Well, we've done it.
We got rid of her, at last.

359
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,541
What did you expect?
You're a genius.

360
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,164
Well, it's not bad for
the Simple Simon.

361
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,715
Fabulous, isn't it?

362
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,981
You are the Ridgeway
girl, aren't you?

363
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:35,937
And you're Mrs. Van Schuyler.

364
00:32:36,344 --> 00:32:38,419
I wondered if we'd
ever break the ice.

365
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:44,167
Well I seldom talk to strangers,
but never to strange honeymooners.

366
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:46,343
I'm glad you're
breaking your rule.

367
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:49,172
Well, rules are
made to be broken.

368
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:52,480
At least mine are... by me.

369
00:32:56,698 --> 00:32:58,845
Oh, they're beautiful.

370
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:00,623
Thank you.

371
00:33:00,884 --> 00:33:02,452
And amazing, ...

372
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,470
if you know how they're made.

373
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:10,707
A tiny piece of grit makes
its way into an oyster

374
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,760
which eventually becomes
a pearl of great price

375
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:19,307
hanging round the neck of
a pretty girl like you.

376
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:22,844
I never thought of it that way.

377
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:24,318
Well, you should.

378
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:27,834
The oyster nearly dies.

379
00:33:30,406 --> 00:33:33,157
Come along now. Back to the cabin.
Time for your massage.

380
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:34,992
My Companion, Bowers.

381
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:37,916
She did 15 rounds once
with Jack Dempsey.

382
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:40,530
He was never the same man again.

383
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:42,196
Sorry, Miss Ridgeway.

384
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:45,228
Mrs. Doyle. Mrs. Simon Doyle.

385
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:47,363
You have got to
forgive Miss Bowers

386
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:50,595
she's just unfamiliar
with the marriage state.

387
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,973
- I saw you drooling over her pearls.
- Shut up, Bowers.

388
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:56,894
You'd give every tooth in your
head to lay your hands on them.

389
00:33:56,914 --> 00:34:00,668
What nonsense, just because you've got a
grudge against her, or rather her father, ...

390
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:03,001
No need to be uncivil?
Grudge!?

391
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,194
Melhuish Ridgeway
ruined my family.

392
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:08,531
Well, you should be grateful.

393
00:34:08,532 --> 00:34:13,143
If he hadn't, you'd have missed
the pleasure of working for me.

394
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:16,090
I could kill her on
that score alone.

395
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:20,182
Tea, Madam?

396
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:27,985
I am Salome Otterbourne
and I must have a word.

397
00:34:28,214 --> 00:34:31,745
I thought we were already having words, ...
through our lawyers.

398
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:34,910
It is about that, that I
have come to supplicate.

399
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:38,766
- Supplicate?
- I mean to entreat or to appeal if you like.

400
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:43,676
I'm afraid we authors are a
little flowery in our speech.

401
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:46,317
And defamatory in our writing.

402
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:52,655
I'm sorry you should have taken "Passion
Under the Persimmon Tree" that way.

403
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:56,637
I assure you the intention was
merely to show a young girl's heart

404
00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:59,605
beginning to beat to
the primordial drum.

405
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:05,342
Can't you see my dear that what I
wrote was really quite flattering?

406
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:07,608
Frankly, Miss Otterbourne,

407
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:12,694
I don't consider being likened to a
nympho-maniacal baboon, flattering,

408
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:16,821
and I suggest we leave it to our lawyers
to decide what is adequate compensation

409
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,428
for being the butt of
your vulgar drivel!

410
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:20,939
Good afternoon.

411
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,743
Philistine!

412
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:26,052
I'll show you what
reputation is about!

413
00:35:49,643 --> 00:35:52,142
I'm sorry to intrude.

414
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:53,393
Uncle Andrew….

415
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:56,211
But these are the papers I
told you needed signing.

416
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:59,279
The lease on the
Chrysler Building...

417
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:02,655
Ah let's see, the silver
mine concessions,

418
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:04,776
Baku oil transfers,

419
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:08,302
and the Corn Crisp
Choo-choo merger.

420
00:36:19,006 --> 00:36:22,235
Just sign on the last page,
right on the bottom, my dear.

421
00:36:22,236 --> 00:36:24,224
But Uncle Andrew, I
haven't even read it yet.

422
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:27,737
But there's no need, there's no need at all.
It's all quite straight forward checked,

423
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:30,623
and double checked, by me.

424
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,481
But I always read everything
through before I sign.

425
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,253
My father taught me that.

426
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:39,006
He always said never to trust anyone.
Not even your own lawyers.

427
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:41,931
Dear old Melhuish.
What a sense of humour!

428
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:45,654
Well, as far as I'm concerned, I never
read a legal document in my life

429
00:36:45,655 --> 00:36:47,568
and I certainly don't
intend to start now.

430
00:36:48,863 --> 00:36:49,931
You don't say.

431
00:36:50,623 --> 00:36:53,965
- Isn't that a little feckless, Darling?
- Yes, absolutely.

432
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:56,618
But I'm dying for a
Manhattan, aren't you?

433
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,635
All right.

434
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:00,962
Seeing we're on our honeymoon.

435
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:02,175
That's a girl.

436
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:07,568
Now, the next one.

437
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:10,999
I do hope I'm not, uh, ...
butting in.

438
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:15,162
I am a lawyer. I just wanted to say how
much I admire your business like attitude.

439
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:16,797
Your father was
absolutely right.

440
00:37:16,798 --> 00:37:19,334
Never sign a document
until you've read it.

441
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:21,279
I'm sure you agree, sir.

442
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:26,019
Uh…sure. Sure. There's no hurry.

443
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:30,567
Well, now if you excuse me.

444
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,985
I hope I've not given offense.

445
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:39,656
What if you have? Mister…?

446
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,572
- Race. Colonel Race.
- What if you have, Colonel?

447
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:45,328
Lawyers are trained to
deal with offenses.

448
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:49,147
- Would you join us for a drink in the bar?
- Thank you. Most kind.

449
00:37:49,148 --> 00:37:51,239
And what about you, Mr. P.?

450
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,327
After all, there's cause
for celebration.

451
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:56,138
As you see my plan to lose
Jackie worked like a charm.

452
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,434
Yes, so it would ah, ...

453
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:01,988
so it would seem.
Mes félicitations.

454
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,778
Colonel Race and I
will join you in a...

455
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:08,497
moment.

456
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:09,926
Darling.

457
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:18,891
- Madame, I must talk with you.
- Later, Louise.

458
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:21,090
No, now! It's important.

459
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,657
I'll see you in the bar.

460
00:38:23,496 --> 00:38:26,235
- Well?
- I've received a cable.

461
00:38:26,236 --> 00:38:28,992
My fiancé has sent his
woman back to her people.

462
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,004
He's waiting for me.

463
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:32,324
I must go to him.

464
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,766
Please, give me the money
that you promised me.

465
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:37,053
I've been with you
for 5 years now.

466
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:39,220
It's completely out
of the question.

467
00:38:39,715 --> 00:38:42,587
Madame, you promised me.

468
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:44,538
He's still married, Louise.

469
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:46,829
I implore you.

470
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,959
I need that money as a dowry.

471
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,631
I've worked hard for you.

472
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:53,761
And you'll continue to do
so until I say otherwise.

473
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:57,580
- Madame, you can't refuse me.
- Thank you, Louise.

474
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,034
Chameau!

475
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,306
Mon Dieu, how she makes
enemies of them all.

476
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:11,327
Even her own lawyer is trying to...
cheat her?

477
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:13,644
You old fox! So you noticed?

478
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,298
Well, I knew that you weren't
here, how was it again?, ...

479
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:19,544
"seulement pour les
vacances, mon ami".

480
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,874
Yes, I suppose I can tell you.

481
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:25,146
Sub Rosa, I am working for
Mrs. Doyle's English lawyers,

482
00:39:25,356 --> 00:39:28,202
and they suspect Andrew Pennington of...
well of...

483
00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:30,849
- Embezzling her money!
- That's about the size of it.

484
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,900
You see under the terms
of the father's will,

485
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:35,439
she gets control of the
money when she marries, ...

486
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,149
and as she has
recently married...

487
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,688
he is trying to get her to sign a document
which will get him out of... the soup.

488
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,561
Exactly.

489
00:39:41,918 --> 00:39:45,664
I think I've scared him off for the moment,
but who knows what he'll try next.

490
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,809
Or any of them, for that matter.

491
00:41:58,509 --> 00:42:00,994
Inside the Great
Temple of Karnak,

492
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:06,541
we pass the pedestals of
numerous small rams... Ja.

493
00:42:06,542 --> 00:42:11,668
Each with a small image of Amenophis
III in front of it. Yeah.

494
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:14,681
Oh, yes, rams.

495
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:18,750
Lecherousch, priapic,
erotisch, ... Rams!

496
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,426
How noble they are!

497
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:23,896
With their proud flanks,
flared nostrils, ...

498
00:42:23,897 --> 00:42:26,505
and unashamed curled horns.

499
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:28,740
Ja, ...
Ja, come, fraulein, come.

500
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:34,724
You know, Carl Marx said

501
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:37,189
that religion was the
opium of the people.

502
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,446
For your mother,
it's obviously sex.

503
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:41,707
Don't you think you better
calm her down a little?

504
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,591
She'd do one of those
beasts a fearful injury.

505
00:42:43,592 --> 00:42:46,762
Look, Mr. Ferguson.
My mother may be a figure of fun for you,

506
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:48,671
but she still happens
to be my mother.

507
00:42:48,672 --> 00:42:52,885
She kept me marvellously in better days, and
I'm not going to desert her now that...

508
00:42:54,524 --> 00:42:56,505
- Now that what?
- Nothing.

509
00:42:57,673 --> 00:42:58,931
I'm sorry.

510
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:02,870
I didn't mean to be nosy.
And I certainly didn't mean to offend you.

511
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,443
Honestly, Miss Otterbourne,
I am not as bad as I look.

512
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:07,526
- Aren't you?
- Scout's honour?

513
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:15,493
Would you mind offending her?

514
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:17,929
Linnet Ridgeway's a leech.

515
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,916
A parasite on the
skin of society.

516
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:23,380
For God's sake, in a sane world, she'd be
bumped off as a warning to the others.

517
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:25,693
- Bumped off?
- That's what I said.

518
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:29,022
- Mr. Ferguson?
- Jim.

519
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:32,612
Jim, ... is it true you
can't libel the dead?

520
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:35,885
I'm not sure I
understand the question.

521
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:38,158
Never mind.

522
00:43:38,178 --> 00:43:42,733
Oh look, isn't it wonderful?
Sight beyond comprehension!

523
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:46,048
Ah, the artistic temperament,
Monsieur Pennington.

524
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:49,177
What strange forms it takes!

525
00:43:49,178 --> 00:43:51,892
I'm afraid that doesn't much
concern me, Monsieur Poirot.

526
00:43:51,893 --> 00:43:54,986
I confine myself to the
world of facts and figures.

527
00:43:54,987 --> 00:43:58,260
The ancient Egyptians felt quite
at home with facts and figures.

528
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,761
The Grand Vizier Ptahotep,

529
00:44:00,762 --> 00:44:05,009
was crushed to death under a
thousand pieces of silver

530
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,341
because he embezzled
his master's treasury.

531
00:44:09,953 --> 00:44:12,202
- You don't say.
- Oh, yes.

532
00:47:37,476 --> 00:47:39,091
Oh, God!

533
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:41,031
You all right?

534
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:42,876
Linnet, you all right?

535
00:47:43,953 --> 00:47:45,971
Come on. Easy.

536
00:47:46,878 --> 00:47:48,832
That's it, come on, up you come.

537
00:47:48,852 --> 00:47:50,173
All right?

538
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,157
What happened?

539
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:56,156
That stone must have
fallen or was pushed.

540
00:47:58,255 --> 00:47:59,360
To kill me?

541
00:47:59,473 --> 00:48:00,856
Jackie!

542
00:48:01,717 --> 00:48:03,569
But she's not here!

543
00:48:30,796 --> 00:48:34,289
- Oh, my poor Madame, that was a close shave.
- It could've been a nasty accident.

544
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:37,665
Accident? That stone has been
up there for 4000 years,

545
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:41,287
it chooses the moment to fall when
there are people underneath it? No.

546
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:44,040
Not exactly 4000 years, Hercule.

547
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:46,261
The pillars were
built in 1788 BC ...

548
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:50,612
We all agree with you, Herr Bessner.
You may have a patient on your hands. Please.

549
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:52,771
Oh, most negligent of me!

550
00:48:52,772 --> 00:48:55,379
- Ja, ja, here.
- I'm all right. Really I am.

551
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,447
Ja, ja, but I think maybe you go back
to the boat, you take a little rest, eh?

552
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:00,659
All right.

553
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,369
But only a couple
of hours, Doctor.

554
00:49:03,835 --> 00:49:06,645
I must see the Temple of
Abu Simbel this evening.

555
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:09,811
Oh, that is most extraordinary.

556
00:49:09,812 --> 00:49:14,159
Did you know that the Eastern-most
figure is the famous Vocal Statue?

557
00:49:14,383 --> 00:49:16,080
- Really?
- Ja.

558
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:19,203
Then we must be there in time.
Thank you, doctor.

559
00:49:20,086 --> 00:49:23,146
At sunset it emits a
sad plaintive note.

560
00:49:23,147 --> 00:49:26,097
- He scares me.
- Oh, he's harmless.

561
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,027
My god, it's fantastic.

562
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:02,944
I think they're frightening.

563
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:05,732
No, they're not.

564
00:50:15,614 --> 00:50:17,416
Do you think he'll
sing a note for me?

565
00:50:17,688 --> 00:50:20,063
Why not? You're divine.

566
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,554
Welcome to the Temple
of Abu Simbel.

567
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:55,934
The facade is 84 feet long.

568
00:50:56,194 --> 00:51:00,454
Each of the statues of Ramses
the Second is 65 feet high.

569
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,467
Get away from me!

570
00:51:06,235 --> 00:51:07,658
Get away!

571
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:09,485
Get away from me!

572
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:11,081
Okay, darling!

573
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,536
Don't let her spoil everything.

574
00:51:48,623 --> 00:51:50,397
So you could not
bury your dead.

575
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:54,439
- You cannot stay away.
- Nope, I can't keep away.

576
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:58,810
You didn't really think I'd be fooled
by any trick Simon could invent?

577
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:03,266
I'm very sorry to see
you here, Mademoiselle.

578
00:52:03,907 --> 00:52:09,264
Forgive me for saying so, but you're embarking
on a hazardous journey in troubled waters.

579
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:13,441
You face who knows what
currents of misfortune.

580
00:52:13,662 --> 00:52:16,564
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's the truth.

581
00:52:16,584 --> 00:52:20,579
You're cutting the last bonds
which bind you to safety.

582
00:52:20,949 --> 00:52:23,813
You can still turn back
if you really want to.

583
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:28,860
One must follow one's
star wherever it leads.

584
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:31,101
Even to disaster?

585
00:52:32,028 --> 00:52:33,822
Even to hell itself.

586
00:52:43,845 --> 00:52:47,359
I left my bag in the bar.
I'll join you in a minute, darling.

587
00:52:59,015 --> 00:52:59,982
Well ...

588
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:02,762
We are alone, mein frau.

589
00:53:03,268 --> 00:53:07,815
The opportunity to talk to you in
private has not presented itself before.

590
00:53:09,027 --> 00:53:13,102
- What do we have to talk about?
- My reputation, Frau Doyle.

591
00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:17,394
- You ran that institute in Zurich.
- That is so.

592
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:20,490
And you have been saying so many
unpleasant things about me

593
00:53:20,491 --> 00:53:23,482
to people of influence
and position.

594
00:53:23,941 --> 00:53:25,983
- I say you're a quack.
- Frau Doyle!

595
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:28,772
- What's more, you're a dangerous quack.
- No, listen to me!

596
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:31,761
My dead friend Myra Seligman
listened to you. Too well!

597
00:53:31,762 --> 00:53:34,517
And allowed you to give her
those filthy injections.

598
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:38,022
I prescribed a course
of armadillo urine.

599
00:53:38,394 --> 00:53:42,691
Ja, I had used it previously
with great success.

600
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:46,135
In the case of poor Myra she
went barking mad, thanks to you.

601
00:53:46,155 --> 00:53:47,625
I will not allow this.

602
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:51,486
These irresponsible remarks about
my treatment have got to stop!

603
00:53:51,884 --> 00:53:54,482
Then sue me, if you dare.

604
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:56,570
No, you know that is impossible.

605
00:53:56,571 --> 00:54:00,470
Any scandal attached to my
clinic would bring instant ruin.

606
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:02,899
Then it's rather your
funeral, isn't it?

607
00:54:03,819 --> 00:54:07,701
Well, let's hope that
it is not yours!

608
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:12,011
Do you want a crème de cacao
or a cognac, perhaps?

609
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:15,074
The service upstairs is so slow.

610
00:54:15,075 --> 00:54:17,203
Nein. Danke.

611
00:54:38,593 --> 00:54:40,096
What time is it?

612
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:44,895
There's a clock. Use your eyes.

613
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:48,681
Didn't your mother ever tell you,
as far as servants are concerned,

614
00:54:48,682 --> 00:54:53,786
there is a vast difference between amiable
eccentricity and downright rudeness?

615
00:54:53,806 --> 00:54:57,483
- My mother was a lady.
- A disposition she failed to pass on to you.

616
00:54:57,484 --> 00:54:58,737
It's your bed time.

617
00:54:58,738 --> 00:55:00,582
Very well. Where's my stole?

618
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,320
I haven't seen it.

619
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:05,524
- You sure you had it with you?
- Of course I'm sure.

620
00:55:05,525 --> 00:55:07,259
Well, I haven't
seen it anywhere.

621
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,976
Use your eyes.

622
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:14,533
Monsieur Poirot?

623
00:55:17,421 --> 00:55:18,923
I hope one day

624
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:21,877
you'll be able to tell me
about some of your cases.

625
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:25,285
The... the juicier ones.

626
00:55:26,014 --> 00:55:29,572
- Ju... juicier ones?
- Bloodier.

627
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,050
Quand vous voulez, Madame.
Enchanté.

628
00:55:33,051 --> 00:55:35,730
- Good night. Good night, monsieur.
- Bon soir.

629
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:44,733
- Oh! So sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

630
00:55:46,658 --> 00:55:49,640
You look very sleepy tonight,
Monsieur Porridge.

631
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:51,731
Yes, I'm... extremely.

632
00:55:51,732 --> 00:55:55,584
I'm consumed by sleep, madame.
I don't know why, but I can hardly...

633
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:57,791
keep my eyes open.

634
00:55:58,961 --> 00:56:00,895
Naughty. Me, too.

635
00:56:00,915 --> 00:56:03,940
Perhaps you'd be good enough
to escort me to my cabin?

636
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,170
It is this way, as you know.

637
00:56:11,748 --> 00:56:16,636
I suppose that uncouth young man will
appear now and attempt to seduce you.

638
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:20,669
Well, don't let him succeed without
at least the show of a struggle.

639
00:56:20,689 --> 00:56:23,583
Remember, the chase
is very important.

640
00:56:23,603 --> 00:56:25,234
Oh, mother!

641
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:28,434
No, this way is better.

642
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,534
There's a beastly step here,
which I always trip on.

643
00:56:31,535 --> 00:56:33,241
No, no, that's the river!

644
00:56:41,588 --> 00:56:43,241
No, no. No, no, no, ...

645
00:56:43,681 --> 00:56:45,616
The old Nile is a bit
choppy tonight, you see.

646
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:48,859
Yes, it is true.
There are disturbing currents.

647
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,177
Here we are. Here we are.

648
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:53,837
No, no, no, no.
In there.

649
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:56,718
- Bon soir.
- Bon soir! Bon soir, madame.

650
00:57:21,256 --> 00:57:22,608
Hello.

651
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:28,590
- Been ashore?
- Yes. It's lovely in the moonlight.

652
00:57:29,223 --> 00:57:31,240
A real honeymoon night.

653
00:57:32,006 --> 00:57:35,232
If the clergyman's daughter
drinks nothing but water,

654
00:57:37,051 --> 00:57:39,233
she's certain to finish on gin.

655
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,186
One diamond.

656
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:45,566
- Simon, ... we're waiting.
- Sorry.

657
00:57:50,181 --> 00:57:51,621
It's your call.

658
00:57:52,446 --> 00:57:54,961
- Double.
- What?

659
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,942
He was her man,

660
00:57:57,613 --> 00:58:00,157
but he was doing her wrong...

661
00:58:01,866 --> 00:58:03,133
Join me?

662
00:58:03,134 --> 00:58:04,387
No, thank you.

663
00:58:06,387 --> 00:58:09,196
Would you mind
repeating your bid?

664
00:58:09,197 --> 00:58:10,344
Sorry.

665
00:58:10,345 --> 00:58:13,153
If the aunt of the vicar
has never touched liquor,

666
00:58:13,154 --> 00:58:17,370
just wait 'till she finds the champagne.
Bottoms up!

667
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:20,122
I'm sorry darling,
I wasn't thinking.

668
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,306
Swore to be true
to each other...

669
00:58:25,646 --> 00:58:28,566
- true as the stars above.
- I'm afraid that gives you the rubber.

670
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:30,404
- He was her man.
- I think I'll go to bed.

671
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,068
I think it's time to turn in.

672
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:33,620
I'll second that.

673
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,441
- Good night, ... sleep tight.
- Good night.

674
00:58:37,544 --> 00:58:39,357
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

675
00:58:39,377 --> 00:58:42,697
- Coming, Simon?
- I won't be a second, darling. I'll just tidy up.

676
00:58:43,364 --> 00:58:45,130
- Good night.
- Good night.

677
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:49,582
- It is late, I think I'll be going, too.
- Oh no, no, no. You, s-s-stay!

678
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,782
Tell me all about yourself.

679
00:58:52,387 --> 00:58:54,255
There's not very much
to tell, really.

680
00:58:54,275 --> 00:58:56,826
I'm Salome Otterbourne's
daughter, as you know.

681
00:58:56,827 --> 00:58:59,635
If the wife of a divine
has never touched wine,

682
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,358
you can bet she'll end
up with the scotch.

683
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:06,498
Go on, you were something...

684
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:10,235
saying something, about
somebody's daughter.

685
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,484
Salome Otterbourne,
the novelist.

686
00:59:13,485 --> 00:59:14,840
Salome?

687
00:59:14,841 --> 00:59:17,349
Didn't she have some
fellow's head cut off?

688
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,453
It should happen to
somebody else I know.

689
00:59:21,704 --> 00:59:23,920
- Don't you think you've had enough?
- Enough what?

690
00:59:23,921 --> 00:59:25,136
- To drink.
- To drink.

691
00:59:25,137 --> 00:59:27,374
What business is it of yours?

692
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:29,352
- None, I suppose.
- Damn right.

693
00:59:29,353 --> 00:59:31,440
What's the matter,
Simon, afraid?

694
00:59:31,441 --> 00:59:33,730
- Afraid of what?
- Afraid...

695
00:59:33,731 --> 00:59:38,957
I might tell this charming
young lady the story of my life.

696
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:41,767
- I really must be going.
- No, no, wait!

697
00:59:41,768 --> 00:59:43,505
It's a very sad tale.

698
00:59:43,506 --> 00:59:46,195
A three-hanky story if
you're easily moved.

699
00:59:46,196 --> 00:59:47,830
For god's sake, Jackie.

700
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:49,252
What?

701
00:59:50,094 --> 00:59:53,320
Go to bed, and stop making
a fool of yourself.

702
00:59:53,644 --> 00:59:57,914
Oh, Simon says I'm
making a fool of myself.

703
00:59:57,915 --> 01:00:00,279
Simon says go to bed.

704
01:00:00,862 --> 01:00:01,801
Bed...!

705
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:05,156
You make me sick!

706
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:06,437
Go to bed!

707
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,978
You can't treat me like this!

708
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:10,263
Now look, Jackie!

709
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,668
I'll kill you first!

710
01:00:12,688 --> 01:00:13,715
Jackie!

711
01:00:28,778 --> 01:00:30,327
Quick. Help him!

712
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,084
Oh, my god!

713
01:00:37,761 --> 01:00:39,387
I'll get Dr. Bessner.

714
01:00:39,986 --> 01:00:43,023
Get her to her cabin.
Calm her down.

715
01:00:44,021 --> 01:00:45,618
What have I done...?!

716
01:00:45,735 --> 01:00:49,828
Oh, that Bowers woman.
She's a nurse, isn't she?

717
01:00:50,036 --> 01:00:51,726
Get her to look after her.

718
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:54,701
Come on.

719
01:00:56,894 --> 01:00:57,926
Simon ...

720
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:00,419
Make sure she's not left alone.

721
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,861
Then get the doctor!

722
01:01:05,321 --> 01:01:06,461
Quickly!

723
01:01:22,904 --> 01:01:23,956
Lie down.

724
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:26,953
I'll get Miss Bowers.

725
01:01:30,118 --> 01:01:32,025
- Simon!
- Take it easy.

726
01:01:32,026 --> 01:01:35,775
Rosalie's gone to get Miss Bowers.
She's a nurse, she'll look after you.

727
01:01:49,812 --> 01:01:51,264
You've been the devil of a time.

728
01:01:51,265 --> 01:01:54,187
Miss Bowers, she'd gone to bed.
She'll be here in a minute.

729
01:01:54,535 --> 01:01:56,446
- The sooner the better.
- How is she?

730
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:59,574
As well as can be expected for a girl
who's just tried to shoot her ex-lover.

731
01:01:59,594 --> 01:02:01,716
How can you be so heartless?

732
01:02:03,623 --> 01:02:06,363
There now.
Miss Bowers is just coming.

733
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:08,101
It'll be all right.

734
01:02:08,456 --> 01:02:09,570
It'll be all right.

735
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:11,223
It's Doyle.
There's been an accident.

736
01:02:11,243 --> 01:02:14,155
Yes, yes.
Miss Otterbourne told me.

737
01:02:16,408 --> 01:02:19,627
I think a shot of morphia
will meet the case.

738
01:02:19,628 --> 01:02:24,915
I've always found it very effective
when Mrs. Van Schuyler is carrying on.

739
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:29,208
Ferguson, you'd better go and get
that... that "hun" doctor from next door.

740
01:02:29,228 --> 01:02:31,552
- He'll go and look at Doyle.
- Yes, right.

741
01:02:38,269 --> 01:02:41,511
Bad this.
Give me one more cloth, ja?

742
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:43,661
All right.

743
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:52,463
The bone is fractured.
There is much losses of blood, ja.

744
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:54,202
All right.

745
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,300
All right, all right.

746
01:02:56,837 --> 01:02:59,011
Help me get him to my cabin, ja?

747
01:03:01,965 --> 01:03:03,734
Are you afraid of
a little blood?

748
01:03:03,735 --> 01:03:05,130
Like a young mädchen?

749
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:08,296
Come here, Ferguson.
Help me get him up.

750
01:03:13,617 --> 01:03:15,532
I'll stay with her tonight.

751
01:03:15,533 --> 01:03:17,373
You never know how
they're going to react.

752
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,933
- Miss Bowers, is she quiet?
- Yes.

753
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:24,236
Yes, I've given
her some morphia.

754
01:03:24,237 --> 01:03:25,620
I won't leave her.

755
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:26,834
Ah, good.

756
01:03:26,835 --> 01:03:29,668
Young lady, you
come with me, ja?

757
01:03:29,688 --> 01:03:33,748
You'll be more use than this stutzer here,
who's afraid at the sight of a little blood.

758
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,257
Open the door. Ja.

759
01:03:39,476 --> 01:03:41,767
- Easy, All right, all right.
- Ah-Ah...!

760
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,176
That's it.

761
01:03:43,373 --> 01:03:45,667
Almost... Here we are.

762
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,056
Ja.

763
01:03:59,112 --> 01:04:00,164
All right.

764
01:04:00,662 --> 01:04:04,281
Could you get a cool
towel for the head, ja?

765
01:04:04,282 --> 01:04:05,596
Yes, doctor.

766
01:04:15,942 --> 01:04:16,067
Ja.

767
01:04:17,259 --> 01:04:18,987
I better go and
pick up that gun.

768
01:04:19,007 --> 01:04:21,639
It's not the sort of thing we want
to leave lying around, is it?

769
01:04:22,131 --> 01:04:23,340
- Ja.
- Yes.

770
01:04:24,222 --> 01:04:25,396
Jackie.

771
01:04:25,568 --> 01:04:27,657
Sh... She mustn't be left alone.

772
01:04:27,658 --> 01:04:29,497
She isn't. Don't worry.

773
01:04:30,585 --> 01:04:34,368
Oh, God.
It's all been my fault.

774
01:04:34,388 --> 01:04:36,683
I treated her so badly.

775
01:04:37,327 --> 01:04:40,011
She didn't know what she was doing.
She was drunk.

776
01:04:40,431 --> 01:04:42,338
Now, this is going to hurt.

777
01:04:46,736 --> 01:04:49,608
Are you sure someone shouldn't tell...
tell your wife?

778
01:04:51,018 --> 01:04:52,121
Yes.

779
01:04:52,678 --> 01:04:53,994
Yes, please.

780
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,263
No. No, no, let her sleep.

781
01:04:58,037 --> 01:05:00,546
Nothing to worry her til morning.

782
01:05:02,605 --> 01:05:04,905
The best I can do
is patch it up.

783
01:05:05,581 --> 01:05:09,786
There is no exit wound.
The bullet is lodged deep in there.

784
01:05:10,158 --> 01:05:13,050
Ja, it will have to wait
until we get to Wadi Halfa.

785
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:15,522
Roll up the sleeve.

786
01:05:15,754 --> 01:05:16,599
Get.

787
01:05:17,037 --> 01:05:19,366
And swab it with this, eh?

788
01:05:19,844 --> 01:05:20,900
Ja.

789
01:05:22,123 --> 01:05:24,396
I will have some splints made.

790
01:05:24,858 --> 01:05:27,251
And then I will set them, ...

791
01:05:27,252 --> 01:05:29,130
when you are asleep, eh?

792
01:05:29,131 --> 01:05:30,430
Thank you, Doctor.

793
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,400
Ja.

794
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,477
Now, don't you worry.

795
01:05:34,356 --> 01:05:36,929
Everything's going
to be all right.

796
01:05:43,724 --> 01:05:44,813
It's not there.

797
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:48,752
Was?

798
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,296
The gun. It's not there.

799
01:05:53,738 --> 01:05:55,470
But who could have taken it?

800
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:58,461
Search me.
I only hope it's not important.

801
01:06:58,033 --> 01:07:02,688
"Sometimes I want to put this
little gun up to her head,

802
01:07:02,982 --> 01:07:05,949
and very gently
pull the trigger."

803
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,091
Was?

804
01:07:09,227 --> 01:07:10,831
Oh, nothing.

805
01:07:14,941 --> 01:07:17,514
I've just seen the manager and
he put the matter in my hands

806
01:07:17,515 --> 01:07:19,936
so it will be our responsibility
until we reach Wadi Halfa.

807
01:07:19,956 --> 01:07:22,581
- Well, I am at your disposal, of course.
- Thank you.

808
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:28,116
- So doctor, what can you tell us about this?
- She was shot with a very small bullet.

809
01:07:28,117 --> 01:07:30,518
A 22 calibre, I think.

810
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:32,777
And the gun was held
very close to the head.

811
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:35,501
Here you can see
all the versengen.

812
01:07:36,225 --> 01:07:38,425
Damn it man, can't
you speak English?

813
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:43,014
- Oh, you mean the... scorching.
- Ja, ja, the scorching.

814
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:45,921
Excuse me...

815
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,181
Tiens, tiens, tiens...

816
01:08:00,379 --> 01:08:02,526
- What do you make of that?
- Huh?

817
01:08:02,936 --> 01:08:05,204
Oh, I think it's...
I think it's easy.

818
01:08:05,205 --> 01:08:07,677
You see, Madame Doyle was dying.

819
01:08:07,678 --> 01:08:10,361
She wished to identify
the murderer... to us,

820
01:08:10,362 --> 01:08:12,792
and therefore she dipped her
finger in her own blood.

821
01:08:12,793 --> 01:08:16,200
She wrote "J" on the wall.
"Jacqueline"!

822
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:21,037
Oh, what you say is dumb.
The lady dies instantly!

823
01:08:21,038 --> 01:08:22,258
- Really?
- Ja.

824
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:24,375
There's no time for writing
with the finger in blood.

825
01:08:24,376 --> 01:08:25,698
No, no.

826
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,131
Oh, you make a joke?

827
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:31,578
Well, it's a very small one, not
in very good taste, I'm afraid.

828
01:08:31,579 --> 01:08:36,190
The fact remains the "J" is on the wall.
Now it's up to us to explain why.

829
01:08:36,285 --> 01:08:40,484
It seems a gesture, which
is childishly melodramatic.

830
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:43,446
Doctor, what about
the time of death?

831
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:44,650
Well, ...

832
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:47,691
She has been dead
at least 6 hours,

833
01:08:48,212 --> 01:08:49,935
no longer than eight.

834
01:08:49,955 --> 01:08:52,347
That puts it between
midnight and 2 AM.

835
01:08:52,348 --> 01:08:54,963
- Which is extraordinary.
- Why is that?

836
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,359
Because it means quite simply
that Mademoiselle Jacqueline...

837
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,868
could not have done it.

838
01:09:00,129 --> 01:09:02,101
You told me yourself,
Mon Colonel,

839
01:09:02,214 --> 01:09:06,651
that Madame Doyle left the observation
saloon a little before 11:45,

840
01:09:06,652 --> 01:09:08,112
to go to bed.

841
01:09:08,113 --> 01:09:09,261
And from then on,

842
01:09:09,281 --> 01:09:13,579
Jackie was in view either of
Mademoiselle Rosalie and Monsieur Doyle

843
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:16,464
or Monsieur Ferguson and
Mademoiselle Bowers,

844
01:09:16,465 --> 01:09:18,659
who injected her with morphia

845
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:22,168
and stayed with her in
her cabin all night.

846
01:09:23,015 --> 01:09:26,624
And Simon Doyle is also eliminated
by reason of his broken leg.

847
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:28,819
I don't suppose he could walk
very far with that wound?

848
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:30,974
Not one step, I assure you.

849
01:09:30,975 --> 01:09:34,104
Excellent! Let's hope the process
of elimination continues as smoothly.

850
01:09:34,105 --> 01:09:36,607
I am afraid it will
not, Mon Colonel.

851
01:09:36,608 --> 01:09:38,068
After all, everyone
on this boat

852
01:09:38,069 --> 01:09:41,403
knew exactly why Mademoiselle
Jacqueline hated Madame Doyle.

853
01:09:41,404 --> 01:09:45,894
She was a natural for what the
Americans would call a "frame up".

854
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:49,481
At least, Mein Herr,
you cannot suspect me!

855
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:51,633
Oh, why not?

856
01:09:51,836 --> 01:09:55,531
You had a very good reason to kill
her, as I discovered last night.

857
01:09:55,935 --> 01:09:58,631
Oh. Then you did overhear!

858
01:09:58,632 --> 01:10:02,107
But that was no motive.
I mean I could have sued her.

859
01:10:02,108 --> 01:10:05,349
And risk ruin?
Murder is cheaper.

860
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:07,779
And safer, if you
don't get caught.

861
01:10:08,028 --> 01:10:11,748
- But I... I could not have done such a thing.
- I disagree.

862
01:10:12,115 --> 01:10:15,289
At the time of the shooting
of Monsieur Doyle,

863
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:17,099
you could have been on deck,

864
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,432
perhaps unable to sleep.

865
01:10:20,346 --> 01:10:22,707
You could have heard
the sound of voices,

866
01:10:23,756 --> 01:10:25,701
looked through the
window of the saloon,

867
01:10:26,178 --> 01:10:27,576
seen what happened, ...

868
01:10:27,596 --> 01:10:28,458
Go to bed!

869
01:10:28,478 --> 01:10:30,454
You can't treat me like this!

870
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,929
Now look, Jackie!

871
01:10:32,051 --> 01:10:33,873
I'll kill you first!

872
01:10:33,893 --> 01:10:35,076
Jackie!

873
01:10:39,751 --> 01:10:42,366
and remembed the
position of the gun.

874
01:10:42,857 --> 01:10:45,562
Later, when you were
called from your cabin,

875
01:10:46,023 --> 01:10:47,931
you could have picked up the gun

876
01:10:47,932 --> 01:10:50,163
while you were tending
Monsieur Doyle.

877
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:52,870
Later still, when all was quiet,

878
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:57,494
you could have left your cabin,
unobserved by your sleeping patient,

879
01:10:58,096 --> 01:11:00,207
and gone to Madame
Doyle's cabin,

880
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:02,197
and shot her.

881
01:11:04,498 --> 01:11:07,344
No, Herr Doctor, I
cannot rule you out.

882
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:11,138
What you are suggesting
is übermässig!

883
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,763
Outrageous!, Ja!.

884
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:20,323
I will not stay here to...
to be insulted.

885
01:11:52,935 --> 01:11:55,185
Found something in
the nail varnish?

886
01:11:55,606 --> 01:11:59,275
On attrape pas les mouches
avec le vinaigre.

887
01:11:59,331 --> 01:12:01,604
- I beg your pardon?
- It's an old French proverb,

888
01:12:01,624 --> 01:12:05,023
which...it takes too
long to explain.

889
01:12:05,024 --> 01:12:07,840
Come my friend. Let us prepare
ourselves for our investigation

890
01:12:07,841 --> 01:12:10,459
of the paying customers.

891
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:16,715
How long was it, in
your estimation,

892
01:12:16,716 --> 01:12:19,116
between the time you
and Doctor Bessner

893
01:12:19,117 --> 01:12:22,039
carried Monsieur Doyle
from the saloon

894
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,998
to when you returned
to look for the gun?

895
01:12:25,562 --> 01:12:28,718
- Oh, about three or four minutes.
- Three or four minutes.

896
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:32,548
By your own admission, you were just outside
the saloon when the shooting took place.

897
01:12:32,568 --> 01:12:34,876
In other words, it would have
been perfectly possible for you

898
01:12:35,165 --> 01:12:37,595
to have noted the
position of the gun.

899
01:12:37,596 --> 01:12:39,542
I agree. Perfectly possible.

900
01:12:39,562 --> 01:12:42,189
Perfectly possible.
Also, for you...

901
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:45,009
to have waited until
the saloon was empty,

902
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:47,722
then to have taken the gun,

903
01:12:47,723 --> 01:12:51,216
and only pretended not
to have found it.

904
01:12:58,693 --> 01:13:02,118
Then, before returning to Doctor
Bessner to report its loss,

905
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:04,805
you could have used it
to kill Madame Doyle.

906
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,771
I could have done, but as
it happens, I didn't!

907
01:13:09,748 --> 01:13:11,275
And you, Mademoiselle?

908
01:13:11,276 --> 01:13:14,263
You could have taken the
gun before you left here,

909
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:17,884
when Monsieur Ferguson
was helping Monsieur Doyle.

910
01:13:27,497 --> 01:13:30,063
- I'll get Miss Bowers.
- Yeah, right.

911
01:13:35,007 --> 01:13:37,960
On your way to fetch Miss Bowers,

912
01:13:37,961 --> 01:13:41,648
you could have seized the opportunity
to take the gun to Madame Doyle's cabin

913
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:43,593
and murder her.

914
01:13:51,685 --> 01:13:55,377
It would have added only a minute or
two to the time that you were away.

915
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:58,451
Wake up!
Miss Bowers!

916
01:14:00,161 --> 01:14:01,191
What's that?

917
01:14:01,192 --> 01:14:03,431
Could you please come quickly?
There's been an accident.

918
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:06,315
Why should either of us
take the blasted gun?

919
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,612
We have no reason to
murder Linnet Doyle.

920
01:14:08,632 --> 01:14:11,150
Ah, but she was "a leech".

921
01:14:11,151 --> 01:14:13,759
She was "a parasite on
the skin of society"...

922
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:15,946
"...who deserved
to be bumped off".

923
01:14:16,219 --> 01:14:18,435
- Well, yes, but ...
- Oh, yes, Monsieur. "Bumped off", ...

924
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:20,683
"as a warning to the others".

925
01:14:20,703 --> 01:14:22,840
You damned froggy eavesdropper.

926
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:26,317
Belgian. Belgian eavesdropper,
if you please, sir.

927
01:14:27,299 --> 01:14:28,614
And you, Mademoiselle.

928
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:32,438
You were eager to save
your mother great damages.

929
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:34,602
How could I possibly
have done that?

930
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:37,626
You asked a question two days ago.
I will now answer it for you.

931
01:14:37,646 --> 01:14:39,643
You are quite right,
Mademoiselle, ...

932
01:14:39,644 --> 01:14:42,919
"You cannot libel the dead".

933
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,369
I think you're horrid.

934
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:50,409
You pretend to be so kind and considerate,
and all you want to do is trap us.

935
01:14:50,889 --> 01:14:53,872
I must find out what lies
hidden, Mademoiselle.

936
01:14:54,706 --> 01:14:55,814
The truth.

937
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,725
What it amounts to, then, is after you
gave Miss Jacqueline the morphia,

938
01:15:00,726 --> 01:15:03,232
- ...she never stirred all night.
- Exactly.

939
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,358
Nervous reaction, booze,
and morphia, together.

940
01:15:06,378 --> 01:15:08,143
They'd have sunk the Titanic.

941
01:15:08,492 --> 01:15:11,294
So, unquestionably, she could
not have done the murder?

942
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:14,121
No, absolutely not.

943
01:15:14,438 --> 01:15:18,362
No, ... but you could have.

944
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,467
Me?

945
01:15:20,785 --> 01:15:22,573
Yes, you, Mademoiselle.

946
01:15:23,209 --> 01:15:26,313
Let us suppose you were out on
deck at the time of the shooting,

947
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:28,206
and saw what took place,

948
01:15:28,226 --> 01:15:31,309
and thus knew where
the gun was lying.

949
01:15:31,438 --> 01:15:34,097
Young lady, you
come with me, ja?

950
01:15:34,621 --> 01:15:37,501
You'll be more help
than this stutzer here

951
01:15:38,019 --> 01:15:40,613
who's scared at the
sight of a little blood.

952
01:15:41,301 --> 01:15:44,217
While Monsieur Ferguson and
Mademoiselle Rosalie...

953
01:15:44,218 --> 01:15:46,305
were assisting
Doctor Bessner, ...

954
01:15:46,306 --> 01:15:51,025
you could have left your unconscious patient
and run in here to pick up the gun.

955
01:15:51,112 --> 01:15:57,568
You would have had enough time before
Monsieur Ferguson returned to search for it.

956
01:16:10,822 --> 01:16:14,521
Then you could have hurried down the
port side to Madame Doyle's cabin...

957
01:16:14,522 --> 01:16:16,230
and shot her.

958
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,412
Preposterous.

959
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:21,267
Why should I kill Mrs. Doyle?

960
01:16:21,268 --> 01:16:23,916
Because her father was
Melhuish Ridgeway,

961
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:27,533
whose unscrupulous business
methods ruined your father...

962
01:16:27,534 --> 01:16:30,345
and condemned you to
a servant's life.

963
01:16:30,346 --> 01:16:31,811
Poppycock.

964
01:16:31,812 --> 01:16:33,344
From whom did you hear that?

965
01:16:33,364 --> 01:16:35,990
From your own lips, Mademoiselle,
three days ago.

966
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:39,120
How dare you listen to a
private conversation!

967
01:16:39,121 --> 01:16:41,672
Some voices carry.

968
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:43,609
Is it true?

969
01:16:46,813 --> 01:16:47,881
Yes, it is.

970
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:49,365
Voilà!

971
01:16:49,656 --> 01:16:53,967
But why should I kill Mrs. Doyle for
something that happened years ago?

972
01:16:53,968 --> 01:16:58,745
Because its effects are still
deeply resented by you to this day.

973
01:16:58,746 --> 01:17:00,997
No, unfortunately, Mademoiselle,

974
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:03,613
I cannot be persuaded
by your protestations.

975
01:17:03,633 --> 01:17:08,355
To my mind, you had the means, the motive,
the opportunity, and what is more,

976
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:10,768
the disposition to kill.

977
01:17:10,788 --> 01:17:14,002
- Have you quite finished, Monsieur Poirot?
- For the time being, ...

978
01:17:14,022 --> 01:17:17,872
but you will hold yourself ready to answer
further questions should the need arise.

979
01:17:17,892 --> 01:17:20,035
I shall do no such thing.

980
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:21,636
Monsieur Poirot ...

981
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:26,360
It is true... about Linnet?

982
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,597
It is perfectly true.

983
01:17:34,937 --> 01:17:36,101
I didn't kill her.

984
01:17:36,102 --> 01:17:38,352
I know you all think
I did, but I didn't.

985
01:17:38,372 --> 01:17:40,073
Calmez vous, calmez
vous, ma petit.

986
01:17:40,074 --> 01:17:42,992
We know that you did not kill Madame Doyle.
We have proved it.

987
01:17:42,993 --> 01:17:45,157
- Proved!
- Thank God.

988
01:17:45,487 --> 01:17:48,387
W-w-what about Simon?
Is he all right?

989
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:52,148
Doctor Bessner seems reasonably
satisfied with his condition so far.

990
01:17:57,056 --> 01:18:01,020
I was mad last night.
I might have killed him.

991
01:18:01,233 --> 01:18:03,416
Do you think he'll
ever forgive me?

992
01:18:03,634 --> 01:18:05,092
It's more than likely.

993
01:18:05,303 --> 01:18:08,138
It's been my experience that
men are least attracted

994
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:10,448
to women who treat them well.

995
01:18:10,627 --> 01:18:15,247
Miss Bowers, will you please escort Miss Jacqueline
to her cabin and see that she's all right?

996
01:18:16,196 --> 01:18:19,070
We'll arrange a visit to
Monsieur Doyle later.

997
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:20,916
Oh, thank you.

998
01:18:34,912 --> 01:18:39,042
I think you and I should visit him first.
He must be awake by now.

999
01:18:41,081 --> 01:18:42,245
Very good.

1000
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:48,813
The thing which intrig...

1001
01:18:49,385 --> 01:18:52,023
intrigues me most about
this case, is the pistol.

1002
01:18:52,043 --> 01:18:54,174
- The pistol?
- Why is it missing?

1003
01:18:54,175 --> 01:18:57,604
Well, I fail to see why that is so important.
In many cases the murder weapon is missing.

1004
01:18:57,624 --> 01:19:01,204
Even in a case where a
"frame-up" is attempted? No.

1005
01:19:01,205 --> 01:19:05,975
Why did the murderer go to the lengths
of writing "J" on the wall in blood,

1006
01:19:05,976 --> 01:19:08,206
and then removing "J" 's gun?

1007
01:19:08,207 --> 01:19:11,050
Yes, I see what you mean.
Oh, they found something.

1008
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:17,035
One thing is for certain: Madame
Doyle was not killed by a fish.

1009
01:19:52,351 --> 01:19:55,686
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

1010
01:19:56,117 --> 01:19:58,302
I must have just blacked
out for a moment.

1011
01:19:58,303 --> 01:20:00,675
Try a spot of lunch.
It might give you some strength.

1012
01:20:00,844 --> 01:20:04,384
- No, thank you. I couldn't face it.
- You couldn't face it?

1013
01:20:04,385 --> 01:20:07,760
- Do you permit, that, uh...
- Please, do. Help yourself.

1014
01:20:18,052 --> 01:20:19,817
I just can't believe it...

1015
01:20:22,316 --> 01:20:23,903
that Linnet's dead.

1016
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,773
It's a bad knock.

1017
01:20:28,994 --> 01:20:31,723
I suppose it must look awfully
black against Jackie, ...

1018
01:20:32,657 --> 01:20:35,233
but I just know she wouldn't
commit cold-blooded murder.

1019
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:37,124
No, rest assured, Monsieur,

1020
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:39,812
we know for a fact it was
not Mademoiselle Jackie.

1021
01:20:39,832 --> 01:20:41,249
Thank God for that.

1022
01:20:42,085 --> 01:20:44,996
Well, then, do you have any
idea who it might have been?

1023
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:48,383
Well, it could be
practically anybody.

1024
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:51,402
Well, only yesterday
she was saying...

1025
01:20:52,371 --> 01:20:54,963
everyone around her on
this boat was her enemy.

1026
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:58,557
We have reason to believe
that she was right, Monsieur.

1027
01:21:04,106 --> 01:21:05,355
Monsieur...

1028
01:21:06,273 --> 01:21:07,268
Oh, pardon.

1029
01:21:08,681 --> 01:21:10,362
I came to see if you
were comfortable.

1030
01:21:10,382 --> 01:21:12,865
As comfortable as can be expected.
Thank you, Louise.

1031
01:21:12,885 --> 01:21:14,802
Ah, the discoverer of the body.

1032
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,354
You should be able to shed
some light on all this.

1033
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,006
Pardon?...

1034
01:21:19,717 --> 01:21:24,021
You, you, you accuse me?
A respectable girl?

1035
01:21:24,022 --> 01:21:27,433
- I swear to you on my mother's grave I...
- Allons, allons, ... Louise.

1036
01:21:27,434 --> 01:21:30,809
Pas tant d'histoires...
Il faut dire la vérité.

1037
01:21:31,249 --> 01:21:32,357
Asseyez-vous.

1038
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:38,711
Monsieur le detective, il
faut pas douter de moi.

1039
01:21:38,712 --> 01:21:42,709
Cette pauvre Madame Doyle.
Tout le monde I'aimait. Elle était s...

1040
01:21:42,729 --> 01:21:46,922
Elle était si jeune, si belle.
Il y a personne qui aurait voulu la tuer.

1041
01:21:46,923 --> 01:21:49,469
Louise, pas de blague.
Nous nous connaissons...

1042
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:52,736
Poirot, can we please keep this in some
language which we can all understand?

1043
01:21:52,886 --> 01:21:57,080
She said that all the world
loved Madame Doyle.

1044
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:59,545
At least that's a
fresh approach.

1045
01:21:59,565 --> 01:22:03,651
Now then, when did you
last see Mrs. Doyle alive?

1046
01:22:04,496 --> 01:22:05,764
Last night, Monsieur.

1047
01:22:05,985 --> 01:22:09,013
I was in her cabin to undress
her and put her to bed.

1048
01:22:09,122 --> 01:22:10,957
And then where did you go?

1049
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:13,218
To my cabin. Where else?

1050
01:22:13,718 --> 01:22:16,544
And you didn't see or hear anything
after that that might help us?

1051
01:22:16,647 --> 01:22:20,854
How could I, Monsieur?
My cabin was on the other side of the boat.

1052
01:22:21,286 --> 01:22:24,573
Naturally, if I'd
been unable to sleep,

1053
01:22:24,593 --> 01:22:27,277
if I'd stayed on deck then,

1054
01:22:27,278 --> 01:22:29,404
perhaps I would have
seen this assassin

1055
01:22:29,564 --> 01:22:32,188
enter and leave Madame's cabin.

1056
01:22:33,066 --> 01:22:34,789
But as it is ...

1057
01:22:34,912 --> 01:22:37,576
Oh, Monsieur, I implore you!
You see how it is.

1058
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:41,268
- What else can I say?
- Nobody's accusing you of anything.

1059
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:43,628
Now, don't worry, Louise.
I'll look after you.

1060
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:46,760
- Monsieur is very good.
- But...

1061
01:22:48,521 --> 01:22:53,333
If you had not gone straight back to
your cabin after leaving Madame Doyle,

1062
01:22:53,334 --> 01:22:55,106
you would have had time...

1063
01:22:55,107 --> 01:22:58,175
to witness the shooting of
Monsieur Doyle in the saloon.

1064
01:22:58,326 --> 01:23:00,639
- Ah non!
- Ah oui!

1065
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,742
You could have walked on
the deck, seen everything.

1066
01:23:04,244 --> 01:23:07,327
Then when the coast was clear,
you could have taken the gun,

1067
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:09,300
returned, ...

1068
01:23:13,668 --> 01:23:15,531
and shot Madame Doyle.

1069
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:17,582
Monsieur, you
accuse me unjustly.

1070
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:20,057
Why should I do such a wicked thing?
Just answer me that.

1071
01:23:20,058 --> 01:23:21,377
Oh, Louise...

1072
01:23:22,483 --> 01:23:23,873
I know all about you,

1073
01:23:24,227 --> 01:23:26,039
and your love affair,

1074
01:23:26,632 --> 01:23:30,634
and Madame Doyle's objections
to your leaving her.

1075
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:33,276
But I had no money,
and no references.

1076
01:23:33,457 --> 01:23:35,188
I had no choice but to stay.

1077
01:23:35,189 --> 01:23:37,555
Précisément.
And how you hated her for that!

1078
01:23:37,575 --> 01:23:39,301
But I didn't kill her.

1079
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:42,499
One final question, Louise.

1080
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,905
Where are Madame Doyle's pearls?

1081
01:23:46,482 --> 01:23:48,104
Her, her pearls?

1082
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,158
She, she was wearing
them last night.

1083
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:53,418
She put them on the
table by her bed.

1084
01:23:53,438 --> 01:23:55,749
And were they there
this morning?

1085
01:23:55,944 --> 01:23:58,432
Mon Dieu! I didn't even look!

1086
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:02,714
I went to her bed, I saw Madame,

1087
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:05,771
I cried out, and I
ran out of the room.

1088
01:24:06,446 --> 01:24:08,040
You did not even look!

1089
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:12,940
But I, Hercule Poirot, have
eyes which notice everything.

1090
01:24:13,737 --> 01:24:17,043
The pearls were not on the
dressing table this morning.

1091
01:24:17,436 --> 01:24:18,930
They had gone, ...

1092
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,764
vanished, ...

1093
01:24:22,376 --> 01:24:23,940
disparu.

1094
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:40,811
- We must find the gun.
- And the pearls.

1095
01:24:40,831 --> 01:24:43,671
Yes, that should not
prove too difficult.

1096
01:24:43,748 --> 01:24:47,199
Oh là là! Qu'il fait chaud!

1097
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:49,528
You're right.
Yes, I could do with a change of shirt.

1098
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:52,706
Yes, let's make a little
pause to freshen la toilet.

1099
01:24:54,104 --> 01:24:57,489
And to rest the
little grey cells.

1100
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:59,170
I'll see you in five minutes.

1101
01:26:47,757 --> 01:26:51,908
I must thank you for a
most timely deliverance.

1102
01:26:53,293 --> 01:26:55,278
It was my pleasure.
I heard your SOS.

1103
01:26:55,619 --> 01:26:58,286
- Do you think it was put there deliberately?
- Of course it was.

1104
01:26:58,427 --> 01:27:02,494
But it will take more than a serpent
to interrupt the investigation...

1105
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,029
of Hercule Poirot.

1106
01:27:05,771 --> 01:27:07,629
How is the sleuthing going?

1107
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:10,231
With eminence and discretion?

1108
01:27:10,729 --> 01:27:14,242
- No one to put the hand-grips on?
- Not yet.

1109
01:27:17,201 --> 01:27:21,445
There is a dead... cobra, over there.

1110
01:27:21,465 --> 01:27:24,474
Do me the kindness of having it removed, please.
Thank you very much.

1111
01:27:24,494 --> 01:27:25,563
Come, Race.

1112
01:27:25,816 --> 01:27:28,882
A cobra? Oh cripes!

1113
01:27:28,883 --> 01:27:33,374
Never have I seen such a reptile
in a first class cabin.

1114
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:34,548
Never.

1115
01:27:44,411 --> 01:27:46,945
Who's next? Pennington?
You know he's a wrongen.

1116
01:27:46,946 --> 01:27:48,370
Oh, he's a dangerous one.

1117
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:14,776
Monsieur Poirot, I presume?

1118
01:28:15,503 --> 01:28:17,245
Excusez moi, Madame.

1119
01:28:21,664 --> 01:28:24,933
Perhaps you will
permit us to join you?

1120
01:28:25,648 --> 01:28:26,987
Of course.

1121
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:32,969
- Well?
- Your cabin is next to Madame Doyle's, n'est pas?

1122
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:37,258
- It is.
- Did you hear anything strange late last night?

1123
01:28:37,259 --> 01:28:40,554
I certainly did.
I am a very light sleeper,

1124
01:28:41,097 --> 01:28:44,180
and I was awakened
by a popping sound.

1125
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,808
A popping sound?

1126
01:28:45,809 --> 01:28:49,849
Exactly. Just like a champagne
cork coming out of a bottle.

1127
01:28:50,935 --> 01:28:53,742
An indifferent champagne,
you understand?

1128
01:28:53,743 --> 01:28:55,941
Not a great vintage.

1129
01:28:55,942 --> 01:28:59,142
That makes a much
more discreet sound.

1130
01:28:59,552 --> 01:29:03,249
Could it have been a small pistol
instead of an old champagne cork?

1131
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:04,703
Very possibly.

1132
01:29:04,704 --> 01:29:06,564
Though I'm sure you
must appreciate

1133
01:29:06,584 --> 01:29:11,136
that I have a minimal
familiarity with firearms.

1134
01:29:18,601 --> 01:29:19,906
We have found it!

1135
01:29:20,052 --> 01:29:23,002
We have found it!
Oh, goody-goody!

1136
01:29:23,003 --> 01:29:24,765
Oh, goody-goody gumdrops!

1137
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,610
This certainly takes
the camel's hump.

1138
01:29:29,828 --> 01:29:31,915
Oh, yes!
And no mistake!

1139
01:29:32,592 --> 01:29:33,689
Gentlemen!

1140
01:29:35,624 --> 01:29:39,149
Gentlemen, I'm sure we have
found what you're looking for.

1141
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,963
- Thank you, Mr. Choudry.
- No mention.

1142
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:54,141
Ah, without question, the
pistol of Mademoiselle Jackie.

1143
01:29:57,605 --> 01:30:00,020
New Derringer 22,

1144
01:30:00,021 --> 01:30:02,601
- 4 shot.
- 2 bullets fired.

1145
01:30:03,757 --> 01:30:06,107
A man's handkerchief.
Looks like blood.

1146
01:30:06,108 --> 01:30:09,625
And a marble ashtray to
send it to the bottom.

1147
01:30:09,626 --> 01:30:11,739
And my stole.

1148
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:13,483
This is yours, madam?

1149
01:30:13,484 --> 01:30:16,895
Well, of course it's mine.
I missed it last night in the saloon.

1150
01:30:17,797 --> 01:30:21,450
Look, the murderer must've wrapped it around
the pistol, to deaden the noise of the shots.

1151
01:30:22,108 --> 01:30:25,281
Impertinence! That stole was
given to me in Romania by...

1152
01:30:25,301 --> 01:30:27,458
Crown Prince Carol himself.

1153
01:30:27,624 --> 01:30:31,336
People are no respecters of
other people's property.

1154
01:30:31,337 --> 01:30:34,364
Nor, indeed of other
people's jewellery.

1155
01:30:35,987 --> 01:30:38,777
What can you be
referring to, Monsieur?

1156
01:30:38,906 --> 01:30:41,391
I'm referring to the
Potsdam pearls, Madame!

1157
01:30:41,392 --> 01:30:44,833
Which belong to Madame Doyle
and which have been abducted!

1158
01:30:45,738 --> 01:30:47,095
Abducted?

1159
01:30:47,364 --> 01:30:48,341
Dérobé.

1160
01:30:48,557 --> 01:30:50,017
Purloined.

1161
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:52,012
Pinched.

1162
01:30:53,237 --> 01:30:54,870
And why are you looking at me

1163
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:58,251
in that, "too familiar",
continental way?

1164
01:30:58,992 --> 01:31:01,321
What have these
pearls to do with me?

1165
01:31:01,462 --> 01:31:06,820
Ah, I am the nasty little
eavesdropper, Madame.

1166
01:31:07,413 --> 01:31:10,680
I heard that you much admire these
pearls, that you would give...

1167
01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:13,925
"every tooth in your
head to possess them.".

1168
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:16,427
That bloody Bowers!

1169
01:31:16,428 --> 01:31:20,533
It is my theory that you have an
obsessive love of jewellery, Madame.

1170
01:31:20,534 --> 01:31:23,416
That you coveted
Madame Doyle's pearls.

1171
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:25,402
And that you determined
to possess them,

1172
01:31:25,422 --> 01:31:27,703
even if this meant robbery...

1173
01:31:27,704 --> 01:31:30,458
or, murder?

1174
01:31:31,228 --> 01:31:33,752
You do not deny it, Madame?

1175
01:31:33,753 --> 01:31:37,303
I can picture you walking
the deck last night,

1176
01:31:37,415 --> 01:31:40,526
waiting for Madame
Doyle to be asleep.

1177
01:31:40,546 --> 01:31:41,575
Go to bed!

1178
01:31:41,576 --> 01:31:43,599
Quite by chance, you see the
shooting in the saloon.

1179
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,882
Look, Jackie!

1180
01:31:44,902 --> 01:31:46,308
I'll kill you first!

1181
01:31:46,422 --> 01:31:47,840
Jackie!

1182
01:31:49,276 --> 01:31:53,413
When the room is empty, you seize
the opportunity of taking the gun,

1183
01:31:53,668 --> 01:31:57,790
you go to Madame Doyle's cabin knowing
that her husband will not be there.

1184
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:07,262
You shoot her, ...

1185
01:32:07,632 --> 01:32:11,850
and then you take the pearls
from her bedside table.

1186
01:32:12,388 --> 01:32:14,534
You will withdraw that!

1187
01:32:14,665 --> 01:32:18,907
...Or I shall prosecute you for
slander with the utmost vigour!

1188
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:23,432
It will not equal the vigour with
which I shall search this boat,

1189
01:32:23,433 --> 01:32:26,805
and in particular, your cabin
Madame, for those pearls.

1190
01:32:26,806 --> 01:32:28,485
I give you a good afternoon.

1191
01:32:28,633 --> 01:32:32,096
You perfectly foul,
French upstart!

1192
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,744
Belgian upstart, please, Madame.

1193
01:32:38,181 --> 01:32:40,382
Was it necessary to be so
rough on the old lady?

1194
01:32:40,485 --> 01:32:42,446
I mean really, you seem to be
accusing everybody.

1195
01:32:42,452 --> 01:32:45,993
With reason, mon Colonel.
What, you think old ladies don't commit murder?

1196
01:32:46,013 --> 01:32:48,033
I am convinced she
has the pearls.

1197
01:32:48,137 --> 01:32:51,201
The only question is, did
she kill to acquire them?

1198
01:32:51,202 --> 01:32:52,388
Monsieur Choudry!

1199
01:32:52,821 --> 01:32:53,779
Marhaba!

1200
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,247
- Yes, Colonel?
- We will depart immediately.

1201
01:32:57,248 --> 01:32:58,608
I've already given the orders.

1202
01:32:58,609 --> 01:33:02,230
At this very moment, the
engineer is building up steam.

1203
01:33:04,105 --> 01:33:05,258
Why the sudden rush?

1204
01:33:05,278 --> 01:33:08,590
I tell you, mon Dieu, I feel the
presence of evil all about me.

1205
01:33:08,732 --> 01:33:11,885
The sooner we reach
Wadi Halfa, the better.

1206
01:33:12,085 --> 01:33:16,315
- I'll lock these up in a safe place.
- Then we must commence our search for the pearls.

1207
01:33:27,656 --> 01:33:31,457
That's the last of the crew's cabins.
Maybe she threw them overboard.

1208
01:33:32,655 --> 01:33:36,006
You forget that we have not yet
examined Pennington's cabin.

1209
01:33:36,007 --> 01:33:37,330
That's right.
Let's do it now.

1210
01:33:37,609 --> 01:33:39,525
Ahoy there!

1211
01:33:40,087 --> 01:33:42,278
So our journey is continuing.

1212
01:33:42,279 --> 01:33:43,983
Good afternoon, Madame.

1213
01:33:44,914 --> 01:33:47,280
Will you not join me for
a little refreshment?

1214
01:33:47,281 --> 01:33:48,851
This marvellous little man here

1215
01:33:48,852 --> 01:33:51,978
has just made me the most
extraordinary concoction

1216
01:33:51,998 --> 01:33:55,732
out of native fruit juices.
It's called a "Golden Sepik",

1217
01:33:55,752 --> 01:33:59,978
and is named after the god of the
ancient city of "Crocadilpiece".

1218
01:34:00,272 --> 01:34:01,789
Not for me, thank
you very much.

1219
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:05,411
Sometimes I do take the hair of the dog,
but never the scale of the crocodile.

1220
01:34:05,412 --> 01:34:06,420
Race...!

1221
01:34:06,645 --> 01:34:09,667
And how are you getting along
with your investigation

1222
01:34:09,687 --> 01:34:11,734
of this tragic affair,
Monsieur Porridge?

1223
01:34:11,754 --> 01:34:15,359
Ah, normalment, Madame.
Normally, as they say.

1224
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,414
Oh, the crime passionnelle,

1225
01:34:17,415 --> 01:34:20,024
the primitive instinct to kill,

1226
01:34:20,025 --> 01:34:22,360
so closely allied
to the sex instinct.

1227
01:34:23,787 --> 01:34:27,155
I have every sympathy for that
poor, half-crazed Jackie.

1228
01:34:27,156 --> 01:34:29,315
Her emotions are a termoil,

1229
01:34:29,316 --> 01:34:31,688
her hot Latin blood raging

1230
01:34:31,689 --> 01:34:34,230
to be avenged on the
woman who stole her man.

1231
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:37,402
Yes, of course, but it could
have been someone else,

1232
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:40,096
with a motive at least as good.

1233
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,181
Oh, who?

1234
01:34:43,618 --> 01:34:45,164
You, Madame Otterbourne.

1235
01:34:45,389 --> 01:34:48,347
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come, come. Both your daughter...

1236
01:34:48,367 --> 01:34:50,429
and you know that "you cannot
libel the dead".

1237
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:54,433
Now you will never have to pay those
huge damages she was asking for.

1238
01:34:54,453 --> 01:34:57,562
- Yes, but one would hardly kill for that.
- Would one not?

1239
01:34:58,752 --> 01:35:01,899
- Well?
- I'll have another Golden What-Have-You.

1240
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,316
You know, Mrs. Otterbourne...

1241
01:35:07,308 --> 01:35:11,940
it is you that I can see looking
into the saloon through the windows

1242
01:35:12,078 --> 01:35:13,986
at that, as you put it,

1243
01:35:13,987 --> 01:35:18,114
poor, half-crazed Jacqueline,
shooting Monsieur Doyle.

1244
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,493
And then, when
everyone has gone,

1245
01:35:21,494 --> 01:35:23,517
running in to take up the gun,

1246
01:35:23,518 --> 01:35:26,996
and then stealing forth
to kill Madame Doyle.

1247
01:35:27,016 --> 01:35:32,984
No! My world is the world of grand love and
passionate romance, not grubby murders.

1248
01:35:32,985 --> 01:35:34,999
Now if you please,
leave me alone.

1249
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,574
Well, if we have disturbed
you, we are both desolate.

1250
01:35:37,575 --> 01:35:39,591
Life can be so cruel!

1251
01:35:39,592 --> 01:35:43,520
You must be brave, very brave,
to bear the calumnies of life.

1252
01:35:46,205 --> 01:35:50,971
Here, Barman!
This crocodile has lost its "croc..."!

1253
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:57,256
What a perfectly dreadful woman.
Why doesn't somebody shoot her, I wonder?

1254
01:35:57,276 --> 01:36:00,167
Perhaps one day, the subscribers
of the lending libraries

1255
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:03,252
will club together and
hire an assassin.

1256
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:35,482
So Madame Van Schuyler is foolish enough
to play games with Hercule Poirot.

1257
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:39,743
You realize, of course, you have no
actual proof that she stole them.

1258
01:36:39,744 --> 01:36:43,223
The fact that the pearls have been
returned does not mean for a moment

1259
01:36:43,224 --> 01:36:46,803
that she did not kill while
stealing them in the first place.

1260
01:37:07,324 --> 01:37:08,488
Pennington?

1261
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:19,408
We must find that...
that document he was trying to

1262
01:37:19,409 --> 01:37:21,700
induce Madame Doyle to sign.

1263
01:37:21,975 --> 01:37:23,158
What's this?

1264
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:25,496
- Poirot.
- Yeah?

1265
01:37:25,748 --> 01:37:30,134
Ho! Well, that proves that Mademoiselle Jackie was
not the only passenger who was travelling armed.

1266
01:37:30,154 --> 01:37:32,209
Still, Linnet Doyle was not
shot with a thing this size.

1267
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:33,816
No, obviously not.

1268
01:37:35,822 --> 01:37:39,587
Oh là là, là là là là!
Quelle pagaille!

1269
01:37:42,793 --> 01:37:45,807
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Your eyes are better. Tell me.

1270
01:37:50,276 --> 01:37:51,763
What the hell is going on?

1271
01:37:51,941 --> 01:37:55,487
We're going through your private
papers, sir, isn't that obvious?

1272
01:37:55,589 --> 01:37:56,960
You're what?

1273
01:37:57,950 --> 01:38:02,370
It may be the custom in Paris to go through other
people's things, but we're not in Paris now!

1274
01:38:02,371 --> 01:38:03,568
Brussels, sir!
The country is...

1275
01:38:03,588 --> 01:38:05,432
I don't care if it's Borneo!

1276
01:38:05,717 --> 01:38:08,878
You have no right to be in
my cabin, no right at all!

1277
01:38:09,232 --> 01:38:12,152
We have every right.
Pending the arrival of the Police,

1278
01:38:12,172 --> 01:38:15,149
the Company has commissioned
us to investigate this murder.

1279
01:38:15,169 --> 01:38:17,617
Which has nothing to
do with my papers!

1280
01:38:17,637 --> 01:38:21,502
On the contrary. They prove that, in
spite of Madame Doyle's marriage,

1281
01:38:21,522 --> 01:38:24,398
you are still trying
to control her money.

1282
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:28,609
So what?
There's no law against it.

1283
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:31,041
There is a law against
swindling your client,

1284
01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:33,514
and my people don't like
to see it contravened.

1285
01:38:33,878 --> 01:38:35,465
Your people?
Who the hell are they?

1286
01:38:35,634 --> 01:38:37,465
I represent Mrs. Doyle's
English lawyers,

1287
01:38:37,485 --> 01:38:40,108
and quite frankly, we are not at
all happy about the way you...

1288
01:38:40,128 --> 01:38:43,015
and your partner, have been
handling her affairs.

1289
01:38:43,016 --> 01:38:44,236
- Go to hell.
- Now look here...

1290
01:38:44,256 --> 01:38:47,607
- Her affairs are in perfect order.
- Oh, I wish that were true.

1291
01:38:47,627 --> 01:38:51,877
You see, I think you came over here in order to
get her signature on this power of attorney.

1292
01:38:51,897 --> 01:38:53,445
You failed, ...

1293
01:38:53,446 --> 01:38:56,620
and so you went to
the Temple of Amun,

1294
01:38:57,394 --> 01:39:00,857
and you climbed to the
top of the tall pillar.

1295
01:39:13,412 --> 01:39:16,276
There, you dislodged
a stone which fell,

1296
01:39:16,389 --> 01:39:19,295
and which narrowly
avoided killing her.

1297
01:39:26,189 --> 01:39:27,832
You can't pin that on me.

1298
01:39:27,852 --> 01:39:30,362
Now, get out of here!
I've heard enough of this garbage.

1299
01:39:30,382 --> 01:39:36,276
You may have to, one day, listen to a little more of
such garbage from the lips of a public prosecutor.

1300
01:39:36,296 --> 01:39:38,401
Oh, this is yours, I believe.

1301
01:39:38,783 --> 01:39:40,173
Belgium.

1302
01:39:48,862 --> 01:39:51,632
Let us change for dinner.
J'ai faim.

1303
01:39:53,547 --> 01:39:56,183
- Poirot, you have a woman?
- Femme is woman.

1304
01:39:56,465 --> 01:39:58,685
J'ai faim. I am peckish.

1305
01:40:01,184 --> 01:40:03,978
Oh, ... I must have a word
with that little one.

1306
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:06,155
I will join you at the
table, Mon Colonel.

1307
01:40:06,175 --> 01:40:08,934
Be good enough to order
me les morilles.

1308
01:40:09,037 --> 01:40:12,112
Les morilles? Oh, moray.

1309
01:40:18,515 --> 01:40:21,157
Well, how goes it
with you, ma petite?

1310
01:40:21,839 --> 01:40:23,839
Badly, Monsieur Poirot.

1311
01:40:24,745 --> 01:40:26,698
I feel so ashamed.

1312
01:40:27,212 --> 01:40:28,947
His wife's dead, and...

1313
01:40:28,948 --> 01:40:30,973
Now he's available to you again.

1314
01:40:33,726 --> 01:40:37,024
Is it so wrong of me to
hope he'll come back?

1315
01:40:37,025 --> 01:40:38,557
I still love him.

1316
01:40:38,558 --> 01:40:40,954
And now he needs
me more than ever.

1317
01:40:40,955 --> 01:40:43,247
Oh, Monsieur Poirot, could I...?

1318
01:40:43,248 --> 01:40:45,174
Could you arrange
for me to see him?

1319
01:40:45,194 --> 01:40:47,642
Just for five minutes. Please!

1320
01:40:48,483 --> 01:40:50,144
I don't see why not.

1321
01:40:50,145 --> 01:40:54,177
That is, if he wishes, and the
Herr Doctor raises no objection.

1322
01:40:54,863 --> 01:40:56,996
I will make some inquiries.

1323
01:41:01,558 --> 01:41:03,191
Ah, good!

1324
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:05,479
The temperature is down!

1325
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:06,939
All right, Herr Poirot.

1326
01:41:06,959 --> 01:41:10,273
I've no objection, provided
the visit is short.

1327
01:41:10,293 --> 01:41:13,169
- Fünf Minuten at the most, ja?
- Merci, Docteur.

1328
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:16,303
Mademoiselle Jackie!

1329
01:41:16,857 --> 01:41:18,463
You can see him now.

1330
01:41:19,321 --> 01:41:20,719
Thank you!

1331
01:41:23,464 --> 01:41:25,145
- Hello, Jackie.
- Simon.

1332
01:41:29,755 --> 01:41:32,168
I'm very sorry about Linnet.

1333
01:41:33,336 --> 01:41:37,008
- Thank you.
- Simon, I didn't kill her. I swear that.

1334
01:41:37,009 --> 01:41:38,829
You don't have to say it.

1335
01:41:39,338 --> 01:41:40,548
I know.

1336
01:41:44,258 --> 01:41:46,568
Forgive me. Please.

1337
01:41:46,887 --> 01:41:47,930
Jackie.

1338
01:41:49,299 --> 01:41:52,799
Last night I... I was mad.
I might have killed you.

1339
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,282
What, with a...
rotten little pea-shooter like that?!

1340
01:41:57,051 --> 01:42:00,284
Will it be...?
Will you walk again?

1341
01:42:00,285 --> 01:42:01,707
Don't be a chump.

1342
01:42:02,203 --> 01:42:05,746
As soon as we get to Wadi Halfa they'll take the
damn thing out and I'll be as right as rain.

1343
01:42:06,251 --> 01:42:09,534
- Hu-Hum...!
- Ah, ja! Yeah!

1344
01:42:09,851 --> 01:42:13,195
Remember, fünf minuten, ja?

1345
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:16,773
Oh, Simon, I'm so dreadfully sorry!

1346
01:42:16,774 --> 01:42:20,295
There now.
There's nothing to apologize for.

1347
01:42:40,983 --> 01:42:42,378
Qu'est-ce que c'est ça?

1348
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,793
I asked for a plate of morilles.

1349
01:42:45,813 --> 01:42:48,733
- Oh what's that?
- Mushrooms.

1350
01:42:48,753 --> 01:42:50,270
Oh, I'm sorry.

1351
01:42:50,271 --> 01:42:53,720
I thought you wanted a moray eel.
That's the best they could do.

1352
01:42:54,056 --> 01:42:56,856
- Anyway, I've ordered you a new bottle of wine.
- Why?

1353
01:42:56,857 --> 01:42:59,981
Because the remains of last night's bottle
was a little mouldy when he poured it out.

1354
01:43:00,001 --> 01:43:03,013
- Mouldy?
- Yes, you know, it had a lot of bits in it.

1355
01:43:03,014 --> 01:43:07,426
But that's the normal sediment for
a great bottle of Château Petrus.

1356
01:43:11,062 --> 01:43:13,277
- Will you join me in some?
- No, thanks.

1357
01:43:13,297 --> 01:43:15,636
You stick to your wine,
I'll stick to my whisky.

1358
01:43:15,813 --> 01:43:18,838
You drink whisky all the...
Wine...

1359
01:43:19,557 --> 01:43:21,294
Oh, how strange!

1360
01:43:21,692 --> 01:43:23,322
Of course.

1361
01:43:29,882 --> 01:43:31,253
May I...?

1362
01:43:32,398 --> 01:43:36,100
You know, Poirot, the way I see
it, everybody could have done it.

1363
01:43:36,101 --> 01:43:38,425
And everyone had a
reason for doing it.

1364
01:43:38,426 --> 01:43:39,642
It's incredible.

1365
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,738
Absolutement.

1366
01:43:43,632 --> 01:43:45,238
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1367
01:43:54,649 --> 01:43:57,247
Good evening, Madam. Please ...

1368
01:44:37,857 --> 01:44:39,970
Come quick.
Quick.

1369
01:44:56,197 --> 01:44:58,418
- Fetch Dr. Bessner.
- Yes, sir.

1370
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,615
You see what this is?

1371
01:45:07,871 --> 01:45:08,828
Money.

1372
01:45:09,185 --> 01:45:11,476
Looks like a piece of a
thousand-franc note.

1373
01:45:11,861 --> 01:45:13,044
It has to be blackmail.

1374
01:45:13,064 --> 01:45:15,895
She must have known something
about Linnet Doyle's murderer.

1375
01:45:19,578 --> 01:45:21,759
What idiots we have been!

1376
01:45:22,236 --> 01:45:23,992
Ah, non de rien!!

1377
01:45:25,983 --> 01:45:28,340
What did she say this afternoon?

1378
01:45:28,757 --> 01:45:31,851
"If I had been unable
to sleep, ..."

1379
01:45:31,852 --> 01:45:34,476
"if I had stayed on deck, ..."

1380
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:40,688
"I could then, perhaps, have seen the assassin
enter or leave Madame Doyle's cabin."

1381
01:45:42,228 --> 01:45:45,728
But that is precisely what happened.
She did see the assassin!

1382
01:45:45,729 --> 01:45:48,759
And it's because of her greed,
that she now lies dead!

1383
01:45:49,151 --> 01:45:51,051
Not much good that does us!

1384
01:45:51,052 --> 01:45:53,099
We still don't know who
killed either woman!

1385
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:55,539
No, no, no, that's
not quite right.

1386
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:59,301
You see, we have been running in
the wrong direction, you and I.

1387
01:45:59,302 --> 01:46:03,230
We know almost all
there is to know,

1388
01:46:04,596 --> 01:46:07,440
except that what we know seems...

1389
01:46:08,427 --> 01:46:10,070
seems incredible.

1390
01:46:12,090 --> 01:46:13,318
Impossible.

1391
01:46:15,012 --> 01:46:17,584
Ah... killings.

1392
01:46:18,086 --> 01:46:19,735
Killings!

1393
01:46:20,044 --> 01:46:22,817
All the time killings!

1394
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:25,100
Ja, ...

1395
01:46:26,452 --> 01:46:28,704
Dead no more than an hour.

1396
01:46:30,013 --> 01:46:31,969
The throat's been cut.

1397
01:46:33,553 --> 01:46:35,694
With a very thin knife.

1398
01:46:39,962 --> 01:46:41,370
One like this.

1399
01:46:42,397 --> 01:46:44,083
That's very interesting, Doctor.

1400
01:46:44,084 --> 01:46:46,648
Are you quite sure that
none of yours are missing?

1401
01:46:47,249 --> 01:46:48,226
Was?

1402
01:46:50,535 --> 01:46:54,056
So now you think that I,
Ludwig Bessner, ...

1403
01:46:54,169 --> 01:46:57,061
have killed this miserable
little femme de chambre?

1404
01:46:57,706 --> 01:46:59,802
Oh, guten himmel!

1405
01:46:59,803 --> 01:47:01,230
Why do I have to do with the...

1406
01:47:01,231 --> 01:47:04,080
squalid affairs of
the lower classes?

1407
01:47:04,573 --> 01:47:07,288
It is well known they do
not have neurosis, ...

1408
01:47:07,289 --> 01:47:09,517
just animal passions.

1409
01:47:15,989 --> 01:47:18,421
- Take the body to the ice room.
- Yes, sir.

1410
01:47:21,242 --> 01:47:22,830
So you think you know, huh?

1411
01:47:22,831 --> 01:47:25,306
I must confess, I don't see
any real light myself.

1412
01:47:25,307 --> 01:47:28,215
Dr. Bessner has just told me
what's happened to the maid.

1413
01:47:28,235 --> 01:47:32,294
I must speak with you
and Mr. Doyle at once.

1414
01:47:32,784 --> 01:47:35,539
I wouldn't go in there, if I were you.
Dr. Bessner is rather cross.

1415
01:47:35,559 --> 01:47:37,361
My good man, I know that.

1416
01:47:37,381 --> 01:47:39,881
But a little kraut crossness
won't stop me now.

1417
01:47:39,901 --> 01:47:41,558
You see, I know.

1418
01:47:42,858 --> 01:47:46,071
Mr. Doyle, I know who
killed Louise Bourget.

1419
01:47:46,072 --> 01:47:47,467
What?

1420
01:47:47,468 --> 01:47:49,256
You say you know who
killed Louise?!

1421
01:47:49,276 --> 01:47:51,505
Ah, ya, not to shout!

1422
01:47:51,790 --> 01:47:54,184
And you, Frau Otterbourne, you
cannot be here, I forbid it.

1423
01:47:54,204 --> 01:47:55,724
My patient is resting.

1424
01:47:55,744 --> 01:47:57,586
But I must! You see,
it's vitally important!

1425
01:47:57,606 --> 01:48:00,081
You see, I know all. All, I tell you!

1426
01:48:00,101 --> 01:48:03,034
Now look, I will not take
that pushing with ellbogen.

1427
01:48:03,743 --> 01:48:06,636
Mr. Doyle, I tell you that
I, Salome Otterbourne,

1428
01:48:06,637 --> 01:48:09,036
have succeeded where
frail men have faltered.

1429
01:48:09,056 --> 01:48:12,026
I am a finer sleuth than even
the great Hercule Porridge.

1430
01:48:12,046 --> 01:48:15,053
Mrs. Otterbourne, for
god's sake, calm down!

1431
01:48:16,148 --> 01:48:19,162
Now tell us the whole story,
from the beginning.

1432
01:48:19,658 --> 01:48:23,132
- Well, I refuse to speak in front of him.
- Now look, you will not speak at all, eh?

1433
01:48:23,133 --> 01:48:26,363
Now, raus, raus. His temperature is
rising with all this disturbance.

1434
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:29,980
Doctor, it will rise even more if
we don't hear what she has to say.

1435
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,952
- Herr Doyle.
- We are talking about the murderer of my wife!

1436
01:48:34,449 --> 01:48:37,083
Oh, ja. Ja, all right.

1437
01:48:37,332 --> 01:48:40,572
You can stay drei minuten...
Three minutes.

1438
01:48:40,592 --> 01:48:43,436
And you, now you
speak softly, eh?

1439
01:48:48,742 --> 01:48:50,649
Odious little man!

1440
01:48:50,825 --> 01:48:55,074
Madam, do I understand that you have
evidence to show who killed Mrs. Doyle?

1441
01:48:55,075 --> 01:48:57,941
You do and I have.

1442
01:48:58,204 --> 01:49:00,287
You will agree, will you not?

1443
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:02,545
That whoever killed
Louise Bourget

1444
01:49:02,565 --> 01:49:05,161
also killed Linnet Doyle.

1445
01:49:05,181 --> 01:49:06,868
That is quite possible.

1446
01:49:07,229 --> 01:49:08,206
Well ...

1447
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:14,486
I saw who killed Louise
Bourget with my own eyes.

1448
01:49:20,751 --> 01:49:22,376
Pray continue, Madame.

1449
01:49:22,802 --> 01:49:26,488
I happened to be in the stern of the
boat talking to one of the crew,

1450
01:49:26,508 --> 01:49:29,040
who was showing me a
most intriguing sight:

1451
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:33,968
A buffalo and a camel, yoked
together, tilling the soil.

1452
01:49:34,192 --> 01:49:37,131
You saw this by moonlight,
of course, Madame?

1453
01:49:38,643 --> 01:49:39,929
Yes, I did.

1454
01:49:40,202 --> 01:49:42,056
I have amazingly good eyesight.

1455
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:45,243
Anyway, I left him.

1456
01:49:45,341 --> 01:49:47,883
And suddenly, as I
rounded the corner,

1457
01:49:47,884 --> 01:49:49,652
I heard a scream.

1458
01:49:50,255 --> 01:49:53,481
It came from Louise
Bourget's cabin.

1459
01:49:53,883 --> 01:49:56,551
Then, I saw the cabin door open.

1460
01:49:56,737 --> 01:49:58,632
As the door opened wider,

1461
01:49:58,652 --> 01:50:00,413
I saw that it was...

1462
01:50:18,646 --> 01:50:19,820
Pennington's.

1463
01:50:34,264 --> 01:50:36,523
I heard a big boom!

1464
01:50:36,524 --> 01:50:37,625
What now has happened?

1465
01:50:37,645 --> 01:50:39,841
Mrs. Otterbourne's been shot.

1466
01:50:46,227 --> 01:50:47,590
- Mr. Pennington?
- Yes?

1467
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:49,564
This is your gun, I believe.

1468
01:50:49,985 --> 01:50:52,051
Anybody could have taken
that gun from my cabin,

1469
01:50:52,071 --> 01:50:53,506
everybody knew it was there.

1470
01:50:53,526 --> 01:50:56,804
I was saying just the other night, I always
carry a gun with me on my travels abroad.

1471
01:50:56,805 --> 01:50:59,157
It is time for these
murders to stop.

1472
01:50:59,726 --> 01:51:02,011
Already, I have, unfortunately,
delayed too long,

1473
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:05,987
I would like to see everybody,
please, in the saloon,

1474
01:51:06,267 --> 01:51:08,465
when all will be revealed.

1475
01:51:08,838 --> 01:51:10,030
In, ah ...

1476
01:51:11,091 --> 01:51:12,744
thirty minutes?

1477
01:51:19,544 --> 01:51:21,363
I can't believe it.

1478
01:51:21,778 --> 01:51:23,554
Mother dead.

1479
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:25,243
Why?

1480
01:51:26,417 --> 01:51:30,699
- She must have found something out.
- Oh, God! Poor darling!

1481
01:51:31,347 --> 01:51:33,856
I loved her, in spite of it all.

1482
01:51:35,188 --> 01:51:36,831
And now she's gone.

1483
01:51:38,388 --> 01:51:40,297
I can't take it in.

1484
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:42,699
Suddenly I'm...

1485
01:51:43,742 --> 01:51:44,747
All alone.

1486
01:51:47,361 --> 01:51:48,648
No, you're not.

1487
01:51:50,122 --> 01:51:51,778
I'll look after you.

1488
01:51:53,421 --> 01:51:54,678
Oh, Jim...

1489
01:51:56,715 --> 01:51:57,914
Poor mother.

1490
01:51:58,776 --> 01:52:00,352
You'd never have
got away from them.

1491
01:52:01,065 --> 01:52:03,879
Not while she was alive.

1492
01:52:24,814 --> 01:52:28,325
Madames, mademoiselles,
monsieurs...

1493
01:52:28,932 --> 01:52:30,804
the game is over.

1494
01:52:31,333 --> 01:52:33,246
I, Hercule Poirot, ...

1495
01:52:33,247 --> 01:52:36,362
now know, beyond the shadow of a
doubt, who killed Madame Doyle,

1496
01:52:36,382 --> 01:52:39,688
Louise Bourget and
Madame Otterbourne.

1497
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:43,967
Foolishly, I began this investigation
with the preconceived idea

1498
01:52:43,968 --> 01:52:47,171
that there must have been a witness
to the shooting scene between...

1499
01:52:47,274 --> 01:52:50,193
Mademoiselle Jackie
and Simon Doyle.

1500
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:54,439
That this person must
have taken the gun,

1501
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:58,055
from here, after everyone
had left the saloon,

1502
01:52:58,056 --> 01:53:00,622
and must have used it
to kill Madame Doyle,

1503
01:53:00,782 --> 01:53:04,942
and to attempt to frame...
Mademoiselle Jackie.

1504
01:53:04,943 --> 01:53:06,647
You see, mes amis, it is not

1505
01:53:06,667 --> 01:53:10,700
as though there was any
lack of suspects among you.

1506
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:15,064
She might have been killed by someone
trying to shut her defamatory mouth,

1507
01:53:15,418 --> 01:53:19,272
or by someone whose father had been
ruined by Madame Doyle's father,

1508
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:22,549
or by someone obsessed with
the idea of robbery,

1509
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:27,589
or by someone who bitterly resented
anyone inheriting that amount of money.

1510
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:31,449
Or by someone who was desperately
trying to save her mother

1511
01:53:31,469 --> 01:53:34,380
from financial ruin.

1512
01:53:34,381 --> 01:53:35,980
Or yet,

1513
01:53:35,981 --> 01:53:40,915
by someone anxious to escape
exposure as a fraudulent trustee.

1514
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:46,832
Or, by someone who simply mistook
the identity of the victim.

1515
01:53:52,784 --> 01:53:54,171
And then ...

1516
01:53:54,842 --> 01:53:57,136
I remembered something
very important.

1517
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:59,779
On the night of the
killing, I slept heavily,

1518
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:02,137
not lightly, as is my custom.

1519
01:54:02,138 --> 01:54:03,152
Why?

1520
01:54:03,707 --> 01:54:06,766
Because my wine had been drugged

1521
01:54:06,767 --> 01:54:09,759
by someone who did not
wish me to be present

1522
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:12,052
at the night's events.

1523
01:54:12,513 --> 01:54:13,950
This was the easiest
thing in the world:

1524
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:16,983
The bottle's stand open on the
dining room table all day long.

1525
01:54:17,481 --> 01:54:18,736
You, Mon Colonel,

1526
01:54:18,737 --> 01:54:21,852
you even sent the bottle back
saying, to use your own words,

1527
01:54:21,872 --> 01:54:23,889
that it was "mouldy".

1528
01:54:24,152 --> 01:54:25,455
And this in itself,

1529
01:54:25,475 --> 01:54:29,067
plainly implies premeditation
on someone's part.

1530
01:54:30,065 --> 01:54:31,787
It means that yesterday

1531
01:54:31,788 --> 01:54:37,050
before 7:30, when dinner was served, the
crime had already been decided upon.

1532
01:54:37,678 --> 01:54:41,388
Then I began to think back on something that
has been puzzling me from the beginning.

1533
01:54:41,389 --> 01:54:45,112
If the intention was to
implicate Mademoiselle Jackie,

1534
01:54:45,351 --> 01:54:48,477
why had the gun been removed
from Madame Doyle's cabin?

1535
01:54:49,003 --> 01:54:50,759
And then I understood.

1536
01:54:50,984 --> 01:54:54,506
The murderer had removed
the gun because he, or...

1537
01:54:54,526 --> 01:54:57,943
or she, had to remove it.
There was no other course.

1538
01:54:58,371 --> 01:55:00,174
And there was more, ...

1539
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:02,730
Dr. Bessner,

1540
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:05,565
you examined Madame
Doyle's body.

1541
01:55:07,644 --> 01:55:08,646
Ja.

1542
01:55:09,512 --> 01:55:13,325
You will remember that there were
signs of scorching 'round the wound.

1543
01:55:13,345 --> 01:55:17,459
In other words, the gun had been placed
very close to her head before being fired.

1544
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:19,448
That is correct.

1545
01:55:20,527 --> 01:55:23,739
But, ... when we recovered
the gun from the Nile

1546
01:55:23,759 --> 01:55:26,931
it was wrapped in
this brocade stole.

1547
01:55:27,308 --> 01:55:30,534
And had evidently been
fired, through its folds,

1548
01:55:30,554 --> 01:55:33,370
presumably in order to deaden
the sound of the shot.

1549
01:55:34,225 --> 01:55:35,622
Doctor Bessner,

1550
01:55:35,746 --> 01:55:39,564
if it had been fired
through the stole,

1551
01:55:39,775 --> 01:55:43,139
there would have been no scorching
on Madame Doyle's temple.

1552
01:55:44,508 --> 01:55:47,972
In other words, the shot that killed
Madame Doyle could not have been fired

1553
01:55:47,973 --> 01:55:49,616
through the stole.

1554
01:55:50,835 --> 01:55:52,600
And then, perhaps, it
was the other one.

1555
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:56,257
The one which Jacqueline de
Bellefort fired at Simon Doyle.

1556
01:55:56,461 --> 01:55:57,616
Jackie!

1557
01:55:59,688 --> 01:56:03,200
But no, we have a witness for that.
We know it's not so.

1558
01:56:04,512 --> 01:56:07,386
Therefore, there
was a third shot.

1559
01:56:10,891 --> 01:56:13,516
One of which we know nothing.

1560
01:56:15,399 --> 01:56:16,851
But, ...

1561
01:56:17,309 --> 01:56:21,615
there were only two shots
missing from the gun.

1562
01:56:30,834 --> 01:56:33,594
The next curious circumstance

1563
01:56:33,614 --> 01:56:36,359
occurred in Madame
Doyle's cabin.

1564
01:56:37,554 --> 01:56:40,718
In it I found two bottles
of coloured nail polish.

1565
01:56:40,738 --> 01:56:43,124
One bottle was labelled "Rose",

1566
01:56:43,125 --> 01:56:45,839
but the few drops
remaining in that bottle

1567
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,461
were not pale pink,
but bright red.

1568
01:56:48,481 --> 01:56:51,894
And instead of the usual
smell of pear drops,

1569
01:56:51,895 --> 01:56:53,280
vinegar.

1570
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:57,078
Mes amis, it was red ink,

1571
01:56:58,023 --> 01:57:00,936
which formed an inevitable link

1572
01:57:01,104 --> 01:57:04,171
with this handkerchief
which we found

1573
01:57:04,491 --> 01:57:07,401
together with the gun
wrapped up in the stole.

1574
01:57:07,523 --> 01:57:12,190
And ink washes easily out of
linen leaving a pale pink stain.

1575
01:57:13,495 --> 01:57:15,374
Then something happened

1576
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:18,956
which put the matter
beyond all doubt.

1577
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:22,000
Louise Bourget was killed

1578
01:57:22,122 --> 01:57:25,325
because she was
blackmailing the murderer.

1579
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:30,371
We know this not only because of the
fragment of a thousand-franc note

1580
01:57:30,391 --> 01:57:33,856
which we found clutched
between her dead fingers,

1581
01:57:34,581 --> 01:57:39,551
but also because of some
rather curious words she used

1582
01:57:39,552 --> 01:57:41,015
only this morning.

1583
01:57:41,725 --> 01:57:43,100
Naturally,

1584
01:57:43,101 --> 01:57:44,889
if I'd been unable to sleep...

1585
01:57:44,909 --> 01:57:48,562
Naturally, if I had
been unable to sleep,

1586
01:57:48,563 --> 01:57:50,490
if I had stayed on deck,

1587
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:53,153
I might then perhaps
have seen the assassin

1588
01:57:53,154 --> 01:57:56,529
enter or leave Madame's cabin.

1589
01:57:58,156 --> 01:58:01,268
Now, what exactly,
did that tell us?

1590
01:58:02,832 --> 01:58:06,687
What, exactly, did
she tell us...

1591
01:58:07,718 --> 01:58:08,967
with that?

1592
01:58:11,389 --> 01:58:13,543
That she had stayed on deck...

1593
01:58:13,563 --> 01:58:15,042
she did see the murderer.

1594
01:58:15,043 --> 01:58:18,992
Ye... Yes, but you still fail to see
my point, Mon Colonel, excuse me.

1595
01:58:19,012 --> 01:58:21,983
Why did she say that to us?

1596
01:58:22,250 --> 01:58:23,245
As a hint?

1597
01:58:23,349 --> 01:58:26,588
As a hint, of course,
but why hint to us?

1598
01:58:28,442 --> 01:58:31,552
She knows who the murderer is.
All right, she can do one of two things:

1599
01:58:31,553 --> 01:58:34,400
She can tell us or else
she can keep quiet...

1600
01:58:34,428 --> 01:58:37,689
and demand money from the
person concerned, later.

1601
01:58:37,918 --> 01:58:39,674
But she does neither
of these two things.

1602
01:58:39,694 --> 01:58:42,200
She uses the conditional
tense if you please:

1603
01:58:42,211 --> 01:58:44,303
"If I had been..."

1604
01:58:44,304 --> 01:58:47,008
This can mean only one thing:
She's hinting, all right, yes,

1605
01:58:47,028 --> 01:58:50,388
but she's hinting...
to the murderer.

1606
01:58:50,893 --> 01:58:53,833
In other words, he was
present at that time.

1607
01:58:56,211 --> 01:58:58,563
But, apart from you and me,

1608
01:58:59,407 --> 01:59:01,869
only one other person was present.

1609
01:59:02,068 --> 01:59:05,071
Precisely. Simon Doyle.

1610
01:59:07,145 --> 01:59:08,170
What?

1611
01:59:13,786 --> 01:59:14,763
Yes.

1612
01:59:14,970 --> 01:59:18,369
You are under the constant supervision
of Doctor Bessner. She had to speak then.

1613
01:59:18,389 --> 01:59:21,122
- She might not have got another chance.
- Don't be so bloody ridiculous.

1614
01:59:21,142 --> 01:59:25,529
Bloody rid... Oh, I don't think I'm being...
I remember very clearly your answer.

1615
01:59:25,549 --> 01:59:27,368
"I will look after you."

1616
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:30,400
"No one is accusing
you of anything."

1617
01:59:30,401 --> 01:59:33,966
This is exactly the assurance
that she wanted, and...

1618
01:59:34,464 --> 01:59:35,696
which she got.

1619
01:59:39,808 --> 01:59:41,503
Oh, Mr. P.,

1620
01:59:41,504 --> 01:59:44,798
You really have made a fool of
yourself this time, and no mistake.

1621
01:59:44,799 --> 01:59:48,792
I mean, I've got plenty of witnesses to prove
that I couldn't possibly have killed Linnet.

1622
01:59:48,812 --> 01:59:50,585
I know you have.

1623
01:59:50,763 --> 01:59:53,055
But you did kill her,

1624
01:59:53,056 --> 01:59:55,369
and Louise Bourget saw you.

1625
01:59:55,389 --> 01:59:58,828
Oh, what nonsense!
I tell you that Herr Doyle

1626
01:59:58,829 --> 02:00:01,807
could not have moved about the
boat with a fractured leg.

1627
02:00:02,061 --> 02:00:06,287
I tell you that I, Ludwig Bessner, would
testify to this to any court in the world.

1628
02:00:06,307 --> 02:00:10,271
In that case, I would have to say
that your testimony is irrelevant.

1629
02:00:10,948 --> 02:00:11,991
Irrelevant?

1630
02:00:12,502 --> 02:00:14,731
Un-an-wend-bar?

1631
02:00:15,343 --> 02:00:17,369
Un-anwendbar?

1632
02:00:18,509 --> 02:00:19,729
Me?

1633
02:00:21,516 --> 02:00:22,975
I have testified

1634
02:00:22,995 --> 02:00:26,413
in some of the most complex
psychological cases of the century.

1635
02:00:26,979 --> 02:00:29,304
My testimony alone saved
Strutzrumple, ...

1636
02:00:30,163 --> 02:00:33,962
The Dresden Sacre-Tor
murderer, from execution.

1637
02:00:33,963 --> 02:00:35,531
- And on the case...
- Calmez-vous, Calmez-vous.

1638
02:00:35,532 --> 02:00:37,515
I'm only saying that your
testimony is irrelevant

1639
02:00:37,516 --> 02:00:39,771
because you started to
tend to Monsieur Doyle

1640
02:00:39,991 --> 02:00:42,267
five minutes after
he had been shot.

1641
02:00:42,474 --> 02:00:45,911
What I tell you he could not have
moved during those five minutes.

1642
02:00:46,285 --> 02:00:49,308
I agree, if he'd been shot at
that time, but had he been?

1643
02:00:51,009 --> 02:00:55,083
Consider what had
actually been seen.

1644
02:00:55,282 --> 02:00:58,231
Mademoiselle Rosalie saw
Jacqueline fire her pistol.

1645
02:00:58,804 --> 02:01:00,968
She saw Doyle collapse
to the floor,

1646
02:01:01,371 --> 02:01:04,860
and then turning away to seek help,
she ran into Monsieur Ferguson,

1647
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:06,701
who had heard the shot.

1648
02:01:07,546 --> 02:01:12,043
All he saw was Doyle clutching a
red-stained handkerchief to his leg.

1649
02:01:12,306 --> 02:01:15,436
He quite naturally assumed
that Doyle had been shot,

1650
02:01:15,437 --> 02:01:18,357
but the assumption was wrong.

1651
02:01:18,358 --> 02:01:21,838
The bullet had not gone into
Doyle, but... elsewhere.

1652
02:01:22,676 --> 02:01:24,616
And now what happens?

1653
02:01:24,617 --> 02:01:28,063
Doyle insists that Jackie
be taken away to her cabin

1654
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:30,085
and not be left alone.

1655
02:01:31,234 --> 02:01:36,093
And so Jackie is helped to her cabin by
Mademoiselle Rosalie and Monsieur Ferguson.

1656
02:01:36,113 --> 02:01:37,022
Then,

1657
02:01:37,191 --> 02:01:40,728
Mademoiselle Rosalie goes
to fetch Miss Bowers.

1658
02:01:42,011 --> 02:01:46,539
And accordingly all the activity is centred
on the starboard side of the boat.

1659
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:48,051
Miss Bowers!

1660
02:01:59,059 --> 02:02:01,636
Two minutes are all
that Doyle needs.

1661
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:04,212
He takes off his shoes,

1662
02:02:04,431 --> 02:02:06,179
picks up the gun
from under the sofa,

1663
02:02:06,199 --> 02:02:10,720
where Jackie had thoughtfully thrown it, so
that it would be forgotten until later,

1664
02:02:10,848 --> 02:02:13,642
and runs like a hare
along the port deck.

1665
02:02:14,669 --> 02:02:17,572
He then enters his wife's cabin.

1666
02:03:01,533 --> 02:03:04,341
Doyle then takes Madame
Van Schuyler's stole

1667
02:03:04,361 --> 02:03:07,744
which he had previously hidden,
and wrapping up the gun in it,

1668
02:03:07,764 --> 02:03:11,538
in order both to muffle sound
and to prevent scorching,

1669
02:03:11,843 --> 02:03:14,528
fires a bullet into his own leg.

1670
02:03:25,774 --> 02:03:28,310
He removes one of the
spent cartridges,

1671
02:03:28,311 --> 02:03:30,041
which he disposes of,

1672
02:03:31,228 --> 02:03:33,035
and inserts a fresh one

1673
02:03:33,055 --> 02:03:35,684
thus indicating, should
the gun be found,

1674
02:03:35,802 --> 02:03:38,957
that only two bullets
had been fired from it.

1675
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:58,145
He then rewraps the gun in the stole,
adds the stained handkerchief,

1676
02:03:58,165 --> 02:04:02,592
and a marble ashtray to make sure
that it all sinks to the bottom,

1677
02:04:02,618 --> 02:04:06,303
and throws the whole bundle out
of the window, into the Nile.

1678
02:04:06,483 --> 02:04:13,027
And now he lies back on the sofa,
clasping a fresh handkerchief to his leg,

1679
02:04:13,267 --> 02:04:16,572
this time in genuine agony.

1680
02:04:25,369 --> 02:04:27,575
C'est extraordinaire, n'est pas?

1681
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:29,444
It's impossible.

1682
02:04:29,678 --> 02:04:31,115
I can scarcely believe it.

1683
02:04:31,135 --> 02:04:33,926
Of course it is, absolutely
bloody impossible.

1684
02:04:33,927 --> 02:04:35,198
Why do you say it's impossible?

1685
02:04:35,218 --> 02:04:38,025
You yourself told me that you
heard softly running feet.

1686
02:04:38,045 --> 02:04:40,885
What reason was there
for anyone to run?

1687
02:04:40,886 --> 02:04:43,991
Yes, I know, but do all that
on the spur of the moment?

1688
02:04:44,011 --> 02:04:46,860
Once and for all, Mon Colonel, it
was not on the spur of the moment,

1689
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,916
it was carefully planned.

1690
02:04:49,308 --> 02:04:50,103
By Doyle?

1691
02:04:50,123 --> 02:04:52,596
Oh, Doyle...
He merely acted the part.

1692
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:55,457
It was planned by
his accomplice,

1693
02:04:55,458 --> 02:04:58,214
Mademoiselle Jacqueline
de Bellefort.

1694
02:05:01,914 --> 02:05:04,129
You must be mad.

1695
02:05:04,853 --> 02:05:06,496
No, I'm not mad.

1696
02:05:07,048 --> 02:05:08,726
That's the truth.

1697
02:05:09,515 --> 02:05:11,843
Who gave Doyle his alibi?

1698
02:05:12,329 --> 02:05:14,803
You did, by firing that shot.

1699
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,864
And who gave you your alibi?

1700
02:05:18,251 --> 02:05:19,472
Doyle,

1701
02:05:19,782 --> 02:05:23,506
by insisting that someone
stay with you, all night.

1702
02:05:23,946 --> 02:05:26,947
It's not true! It's not!

1703
02:05:27,082 --> 02:05:29,839
It is true.
Why bother to deny it?

1704
02:05:31,159 --> 02:05:33,065
You and Doyle were lovers.

1705
02:05:33,627 --> 02:05:35,858
You still are lovers.

1706
02:05:35,859 --> 02:05:38,322
The plan was that Simon
would kill his wife,

1707
02:05:38,323 --> 02:05:42,050
inherit the money, and then
afterwards, at some later date,

1708
02:05:42,070 --> 02:05:44,178
marry his old love.

1709
02:05:44,894 --> 02:05:47,295
It was a very brilliant concept.

1710
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:50,042
Your persecution
of Madame Doyle,

1711
02:05:50,062 --> 02:05:52,474
Simon's feigned rage,

1712
02:05:52,494 --> 02:05:56,002
your selection of Mademoiselle
Rosalie as a witness,

1713
02:05:56,003 --> 02:05:58,518
and all that build
up to the shooting,

1714
02:05:58,538 --> 02:06:00,976
the exaggerated hysteria, ...

1715
02:06:01,823 --> 02:06:04,454
There was only one
risk you really took:

1716
02:06:04,455 --> 02:06:08,233
And that was that Simon's wound,
simply, had to be disabling.

1717
02:06:08,595 --> 02:06:12,937
Oh, and, ah, pardon me, but
one piece of foolishness,

1718
02:06:12,957 --> 02:06:16,251
which was the... drawing of...

1719
02:06:16,252 --> 02:06:18,145
the letter "J" on the
wall of the cabin,

1720
02:06:18,165 --> 02:06:20,409
so melodramatic it could
only have one effect:

1721
02:06:20,540 --> 02:06:22,575
That of exonerating you.

1722
02:06:22,576 --> 02:06:25,650
And who would want
to do that except...

1723
02:06:26,342 --> 02:06:27,744
an accomplice?

1724
02:06:29,115 --> 02:06:30,617
But then...

1725
02:06:30,618 --> 02:06:33,800
the plan began to go wrong,

1726
02:06:34,307 --> 02:06:35,583
did it not?

1727
02:06:36,146 --> 02:06:38,616
Louise Bourget has been wakeful.

1728
02:06:38,757 --> 02:06:41,820
She sees Doyle run
to his wife's cabin,

1729
02:06:42,827 --> 02:06:44,363
she hears the shot,

1730
02:06:44,662 --> 02:06:47,414
and sees him return
to the saloon.

1731
02:06:49,513 --> 02:06:52,154
She makes her greedy
bid for hush money,

1732
02:06:52,155 --> 02:06:55,287
and in doing so, signs
her own death warrant.

1733
02:06:56,727 --> 02:07:00,958
Herr Doyle could not have killed her,
because he could not have moved.

1734
02:07:00,959 --> 02:07:04,304
- I will swear to that.
- You would be right.

1735
02:07:04,681 --> 02:07:06,731
She was killed by
Mademoiselle Jackie.

1736
02:07:09,687 --> 02:07:11,039
No!

1737
02:07:11,765 --> 02:07:14,422
Yes, I am afraid
there is no doubt.

1738
02:07:14,755 --> 02:07:18,180
Just before dinner, she asked
to see Monsieur Doyle.

1739
02:07:18,809 --> 02:07:22,934
Quite foolishly, as it turns out, I
agreed and brought them together.

1740
02:07:23,084 --> 02:07:27,873
The one apparently guilt ridden and
distraught, the other comforting.

1741
02:07:27,893 --> 02:07:30,258
Oh, Simon, I'm so
dreadfully sorry.

1742
02:07:30,278 --> 02:07:31,731
Now, there now...

1743
02:07:31,751 --> 02:07:36,335
However, I'm sure as soon as
we've gone, the tone changes.

1744
02:07:37,349 --> 02:07:39,777
It's going fine, darling.
We're nearly there.

1745
02:07:39,797 --> 02:07:42,878
Like hell it is!
Louise knows.

1746
02:07:42,879 --> 02:07:45,834
She saw me.
She's trying to blackmail us.

1747
02:07:47,589 --> 02:07:49,213
I'll have to shut her up.

1748
02:07:51,617 --> 02:07:54,429
- Can't we pay her?
- All our lives?

1749
02:07:55,523 --> 02:07:57,218
Jackie, are you sure?

1750
02:08:08,092 --> 02:08:09,500
Give me some money.

1751
02:08:10,490 --> 02:08:11,284
Why?

1752
02:08:11,304 --> 02:08:14,569
That's what she's waiting for.
It'll put her off guard. Where is it?

1753
02:08:14,570 --> 02:08:17,318
In my jacket. In the wardrobe.

1754
02:08:33,954 --> 02:08:36,120
- I love you.
- I know.

1755
02:08:36,809 --> 02:08:40,067
- Are we insane?
- Oh, I don't know but we can't stop now.

1756
02:08:42,028 --> 02:08:43,126
Jackie...

1757
02:08:45,699 --> 02:08:47,136
Wish me luck.

1758
02:08:59,907 --> 02:09:02,277
Unfortunately for
her, in her haste,

1759
02:09:02,278 --> 02:09:06,271
she leaves a tiny fragment of
a thousand-franc note behind...

1760
02:09:06,272 --> 02:09:08,530
clutched in the dead
woman's fingers.

1761
02:09:08,630 --> 02:09:10,655
But even more unfortunately,

1762
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:13,828
she is seen by Madame
Otterbourne leaving the cabin.

1763
02:09:14,257 --> 02:09:18,794
She is unaware of this at the time and
returns to Dr. Bessner's cabin...

1764
02:09:18,795 --> 02:09:20,817
to replace the scalpel.

1765
02:09:21,314 --> 02:09:26,596
Then, having changed for dinner,
somewhat flushed and out of breath,

1766
02:09:26,751 --> 02:09:29,298
she hurries into
the dining room.

1767
02:09:30,426 --> 02:09:32,228
As for Madame Otterbourne,

1768
02:09:32,229 --> 02:09:36,922
when she hears of the murder of
Louise Bourget from Dr. Bessner,

1769
02:09:37,335 --> 02:09:40,707
she suddenly realizes that she has
actually seen the murderer...

1770
02:09:40,727 --> 02:09:42,895
leaving the scene of the crime.

1771
02:09:43,155 --> 02:09:44,333
What?

1772
02:09:44,546 --> 02:09:46,245
You say you know
who killed Louise?

1773
02:09:46,265 --> 02:09:48,166
Calm. Not to shout.

1774
02:09:48,378 --> 02:09:50,955
And you, Frau, you cannot be here.
I forbid it...

1775
02:09:51,068 --> 02:09:52,879
It seemed strange to
me at the time...

1776
02:09:52,899 --> 02:09:56,307
that Doyle should be shouting so
loudly at Madame Otterbourne.

1777
02:09:57,184 --> 02:10:01,001
Now, of course, I realize that what he was
doing was shouting a warning to Jackie...

1778
02:10:01,021 --> 02:10:02,100
next door.

1779
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:04,657
Mrs. Otterbourne, for
God's sake, calm down.

1780
02:10:05,705 --> 02:10:08,658
Now tell us the whole
story, from the beginning.

1781
02:10:09,006 --> 02:10:13,100
And why did he ask her to start at the
beginning and tell the whole story?

1782
02:10:13,419 --> 02:10:16,268
Obviously, to give
Jackie time to act,

1783
02:10:16,269 --> 02:10:18,435
which she did, like lightning.

1784
02:10:18,436 --> 02:10:20,037
I say...
But Herr Doyle...!

1785
02:10:20,057 --> 02:10:22,807
We are talking about the
murderer of my wife!

1786
02:10:27,832 --> 02:10:29,137
Mr. Pennington?

1787
02:10:42,858 --> 02:10:46,890
She boasted once that her father
had taught her to be a crack shot,

1788
02:10:46,891 --> 02:10:49,169
And her boast was
not an idle one.

1789
02:10:49,189 --> 02:10:50,787
I saw it...

1790
02:10:53,392 --> 02:10:56,742
She dropped the gun and bolted
into her own cabin next door.

1791
02:10:56,911 --> 02:10:58,891
It was highly risky,

1792
02:10:58,892 --> 02:11:02,586
but it was her only
possible chance.

1793
02:11:07,376 --> 02:11:08,784
Voilà, mes amis.

1794
02:11:09,197 --> 02:11:10,615
That is all.

1795
02:11:17,482 --> 02:11:19,329
Congratulations, Mr. P.,

1796
02:11:19,731 --> 02:11:23,913
- ...on a highly amusing theory.
- Oh, it's more than a theory.

1797
02:11:24,606 --> 02:11:26,137
Unfortunately,

1798
02:11:26,512 --> 02:11:28,431
it is the truth.

1799
02:11:29,762 --> 02:11:32,037
Then what happened
to the first bullet?

1800
02:11:32,679 --> 02:11:34,628
The one that Jackie fired at me?

1801
02:11:34,648 --> 02:11:36,524
Oh, that's a good question, yes.

1802
02:11:36,544 --> 02:11:38,498
Can you all see this table?

1803
02:11:38,518 --> 02:11:41,625
There's a newly made
bullet hole, just there.

1804
02:11:41,866 --> 02:11:45,518
Of course, you had time to
dispose of the bullet and...

1805
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:47,813
throw it into the Nile.

1806
02:11:47,814 --> 02:11:50,423
- What piffle!
- Oh, no. It's not piffle.

1807
02:11:50,424 --> 02:11:52,926
Remember we have proof that
all the three bullets...

1808
02:11:52,927 --> 02:11:55,383
came from Mademoiselle
Jacqueline's gun.

1809
02:11:55,611 --> 02:11:57,308
Suppose that's true,
Monsieur Poirot.

1810
02:11:57,309 --> 02:12:00,201
Why is it proof that Simon
fired the other two?

1811
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:02,046
Well, that's right!

1812
02:12:02,047 --> 02:12:03,609
You've no proof.

1813
02:12:03,610 --> 02:12:05,794
You've absolutely
no proof at all.

1814
02:12:06,213 --> 02:12:09,321
We'll produce some, never fear.
You won't get away with this.

1815
02:12:09,341 --> 02:12:10,326
No?

1816
02:12:10,901 --> 02:12:14,202
Well, you'll never convince
a jury without proof.

1817
02:12:14,366 --> 02:12:16,647
And where do you intend
to get it, Mr. P.?

1818
02:12:17,456 --> 02:12:18,738
From Linnet?

1819
02:12:19,644 --> 02:12:22,824
Oh, no. Not from Linnet.

1820
02:12:24,029 --> 02:12:25,015
From you.

1821
02:12:27,114 --> 02:12:28,569
From me? What do you mean?

1822
02:12:28,813 --> 02:12:30,306
It's a bluff, Simon.

1823
02:12:30,428 --> 02:12:32,415
It's very far from being a bluff.

1824
02:12:32,626 --> 02:12:34,232
There is a very simple test...

1825
02:12:34,252 --> 02:12:37,631
which is now accepted as conclusive
evidence in any court in the world,

1826
02:12:37,651 --> 02:12:40,328
and it's called a
"Moulage test".

1827
02:12:41,849 --> 02:12:43,131
"Moulage Test"?

1828
02:12:43,210 --> 02:12:46,473
Yes, "Moulage".
You know, when you fire a gun, ...

1829
02:12:46,547 --> 02:12:51,543
tiny grains of powder become embedded in
the skin and they can now be removed by...

1830
02:12:51,843 --> 02:12:54,491
a thin layer of wax.

1831
02:12:54,651 --> 02:12:57,044
That's a "Moulage Test".

1832
02:12:59,315 --> 02:13:01,782
Oh, Mon Colonel,
will you administer this?

1833
02:13:02,144 --> 02:13:03,543
When you wish.

1834
02:13:05,926 --> 02:13:09,513
I assume, of course, that you're
willing to submit to such a test?

1835
02:13:10,095 --> 02:13:12,865
There is no pain involved,
just a little ...

1836
02:13:13,373 --> 02:13:14,509
warmth.

1837
02:13:26,532 --> 02:13:28,135
Jackie, what...?

1838
02:13:29,988 --> 02:13:31,302
Can we do?

1839
02:13:39,202 --> 02:13:40,414
Nothing.

1840
02:13:41,738 --> 02:13:43,033
It's over.

1841
02:13:51,610 --> 02:13:53,920
I don't mind so much, Monsieur.

1842
02:13:54,202 --> 02:13:56,455
A... about me, I mean.

1843
02:13:56,713 --> 02:13:58,912
You do mind, don't you? A bit?

1844
02:14:00,034 --> 02:14:01,170
Yes.

1845
02:14:02,146 --> 02:14:04,249
And don't judge
Simon too harshly.

1846
02:14:04,372 --> 02:14:07,029
He never had any money
and Linnet simply...

1847
02:14:07,357 --> 02:14:09,661
dazzled him with
all that wealth.

1848
02:14:10,264 --> 02:14:13,720
Simon, do you remember
what you said?

1849
02:14:14,142 --> 02:14:16,322
I said if this was a book,

1850
02:14:16,323 --> 02:14:19,929
I'd marry Linnet, and she'd die within
a year, and leave me everything.

1851
02:14:20,192 --> 02:14:22,735
That's when I saw the
idea come into his head.

1852
02:14:22,867 --> 02:14:26,994
I was terrified. I knew he'd try
some perfectly absurd way, ...

1853
02:14:27,014 --> 02:14:30,003
he even had the idea of putting
a cobra in her bed.

1854
02:14:31,077 --> 02:14:34,675
Well, you found another use
for that serpent, mademoiselle.

1855
02:14:37,115 --> 02:14:39,517
I'm glad it didn't
kill you, monsieur.

1856
02:14:39,537 --> 02:14:41,536
- Ooof...
- Truly.

1857
02:14:45,048 --> 02:14:45,948
So you, ...

1858
02:14:47,517 --> 02:14:48,691
you see, ...

1859
02:14:50,085 --> 02:14:51,653
I had to help him.

1860
02:14:53,927 --> 02:14:55,874
I've always had to help him.

1861
02:14:57,800 --> 02:14:59,485
Oh, Jackie, I love you.

1862
02:15:00,668 --> 02:15:01,878
I love you.

1863
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:10,034
Stop!

1864
02:15:15,141 --> 02:15:16,512
Monsieur Poirot, ...

1865
02:15:30,059 --> 02:15:31,749
Quelle tragédie!

1866
02:15:47,894 --> 02:15:50,657
A splendid piece of detecting,
Poirot, I must say.

1867
02:15:50,939 --> 02:15:54,488
You know, I couldn't possibly have
carried out that "Moulage Test".

1868
02:15:54,816 --> 02:15:56,356
I have no wax.

1869
02:15:56,506 --> 02:16:00,573
You ashtonish me, Mon Colonel.
You absolutely ashtonish me.

1870
02:16:03,220 --> 02:16:05,408
Goodbye, Monsieur Poirot.

1871
02:16:05,981 --> 02:16:09,370
I'm afraid the description of
your cases will have to wait...

1872
02:16:09,371 --> 02:16:10,978
until another time.

1873
02:16:10,979 --> 02:16:12,650
Oh, quel dommage, Madame!

1874
02:16:12,651 --> 02:16:16,236
I was hoping to recount to you my
recent extraordinary experience

1875
02:16:16,358 --> 02:16:18,417
on the Orient Express.

1876
02:16:19,055 --> 02:16:20,963
Come on, Bowers. Time to go.

1877
02:16:21,285 --> 02:16:26,077
This place is beginning
to resemble a mortuary.

1878
02:16:26,078 --> 02:16:29,315
Thank God, you'll be in one
yourself, before too long.

1879
02:16:29,316 --> 02:16:31,923
- Bloody old fossil.
- Temper, temper, Bowers!

1880
02:16:31,924 --> 02:16:34,699
What you need is a
nice cool holiday.

1881
02:16:34,719 --> 02:16:39,154
I was thinking of a trip
through the Gobi Desert.

1882
02:16:42,748 --> 02:16:45,533
Monsieur Poirot, I wanted you
to be the first to know.

1883
02:16:45,655 --> 02:16:46,941
We've just got engaged.

1884
02:16:46,961 --> 02:16:49,921
Oh, mes félicitations,
mademoiselle.

1885
02:16:50,281 --> 02:16:51,155
Monsieur, ...

1886
02:16:51,175 --> 02:16:54,350
- Congratulations. And bonne chance to both of you...
- Thank you.

1887
02:16:54,351 --> 02:16:56,103
- Goodbye, Monsieur Poirot.
- Goodbye, sir.

1888
02:16:56,104 --> 02:16:58,156
- Colonel Race.
- Good luck.

1889
02:17:01,027 --> 02:17:02,052
Oh, mes petite!

1890
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:04,490
A word of advice...

1891
02:17:04,674 --> 02:17:06,717
As they say in America:

1892
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:08,468
Take it easy.

1893
02:17:09,467 --> 02:17:10,815
We'll try.

1894
02:17:19,287 --> 02:17:22,995
- What are you thinking?
- I was thinking of Molière.

1895
02:17:23,249 --> 02:17:27,512
"La grande ambition des femmes
est d'inspirer I'amour."

1896
02:17:27,654 --> 02:17:30,284
I do wish you'd speak
some known language.

1897
02:17:30,847 --> 02:17:35,839
"The great ambition of
women is to inspire love."
