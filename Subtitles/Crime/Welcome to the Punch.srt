already been made, okay?

188
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,084
- Well, the decision's bad.

189
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,627
- And so's your attitude.

190
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,752
- Oi, why don't you go
and wait inside, yeah?

191
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,256
Go on.

192
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,104
She's good at her job, you know?

193
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,315
- No, I like her.

194
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,777
She's got the same fire
that you used to have.

[phone ringing]

196
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,330
- How can you do that?
- What?

197
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,244
- How can you just stand there
and not even argue your point?

198
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,663
- If I had a point,
I'd argue it.

199
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,749
- When I asked to work
with you, Max,

200
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,212
I thought
you'd at least have my back.

201
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,581
- Yeah, look...

202
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,675
Look, I've just learned
not to get involved, all right?

203
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,669

up the ass from Geiger.

204

- [chuckles]

205
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,094
- Human emotion, my God.

206
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,520
- You want to get yourself
a notebook.

207
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,605
- You're worried I might get
ink poisoning, aren't you?

208
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:26,099
- Ifs already
infected your tongue.

209
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,397
- At least my ass
is still intact.

210
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,332

a lot of the same questions,

226

so grab pens,
'cause I'm not repeating it.

227
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,248
Last night,
Jacob Sternwood's son,

228
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,333
Ruan Sternwood,
was picked up at City Airport

229
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,828
suffering from a gunshot wound
to the stomach.

230
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,207
Ballistics show he was shot
by the same gun as Otis Blake,

231
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,128
but this,

232
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,843
this is the icing.

233
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,380
Before Ruan collapsed,
he made a call

234
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:24,931
from a mobile to a landline
in Hella, Iceland.

235
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,803
Right now, an SFO Unit's
making its way

236
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,432
to a remote address
94 kilometers east of Reykjavik.

237
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,902
They'll make entry
at approximately 2200 hours,

238
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,145
and they've been instructed
to shoot to disable.

239
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,613
- It won't work.
- Why?

240
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,905
- Because it won't.
They need to hold off...

241
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,073
or let Sternwood think
we haven't clocked on.

242
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,787
Surround the house,
take him when he moves.

243
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,871

You paid the price.

If you're such an expert, Max,
why's he still at large,

not standing up here?

338

- You ducked them like a pro.

339
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,909

as a compliment...

the backing you need,

344
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,917
but for now, the questions
are gonna get tougher.

345
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,636
- Well, I'm sure you'll
spin it to your own agenda.

346
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,879
- The kid at the airport,

347
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,801
any truth
he's Jacob Sternwood's son?

348
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,265
- Where did you get that?

349
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,479
- Come on.

350
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,394
I ran your press for five years.

351
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,653
Could be useful.

352
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,773
- If it's handled well.

353
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,945
- Yeah.

354
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,201
- See you, Jane.
- See you.

355
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,794

there may be a way in

360
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,885
Didn't we, Max?

361
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,219
- Uh, yeah.

362
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,557

about a Blake case, but...

00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,144
I'd put Ruan
in an open hospital, public,

dangle the hooks,

- He's still reeling
from last time.

375
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,156

about Iceland, wasn't he?

376

to Nathan,

379
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,955
and you stay out of his way,
do you understand?

380
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,000
I take your point.

381
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,999
You get the hospital,
but that's all.

382

then, will you?

to start on row two?

388

with the "A" class, son.

- Yes, boss.

You know that.

395

Car was run-of-the-mill?

397
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,308

398

- Took a few knocks?

399
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,852
- I've had worse.

400
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,645
- So why did you
level the house?

401
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,268
- Became just another place
to hide.

402
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,565
I'd rather see it burn.

403
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,357

- Oh, does she now?

409
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,367
Well, you look like
Kenny Rogers.

410

All mouth, no muscle.

by Sternwood.

he shot his own son?

he's been planning something.

he's covering his tracks.

for a minute?

- What the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

- Meaning maybe it's not
all about Jacob Sternwood.

- What else is it about?

551

to Jacob Sternwood.

they scoped the room.

Roy, do you know what?

00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,682
I don't want this shit
in my life again.

753
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,683
Do you understand me?

754
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,435
- If it was one of ours,
we'd do the same.

755
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,481
- If it was one of ours,

756
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,231
this never would have happened
in the first place.

757
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,324
I'm just hoping
that this dead policeman

758
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,692
hasn't got anything
to do with you.

759
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,620
- This government expects
brave officers like Harvey Crown

760
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,870
to go into battle armed
with only a whistle and a baton.

761

- That guy's
not dead two minutes, Jane.

762
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,547
Already you're going to use
that for your campaign?

763
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,916
- This is for your benefit, Max.

764
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,759
When he's home secretary,
you're going to get

the proper tools
you need to do your job,

won't be shit-scared
just to walk down the street.

768
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,891
Of all people, I thought
you'd have believed in that.

769

- Jane,
I'm paid to <i>catch</i> crooks,

I've got to talk to you.

773
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,775
I can't understand

774
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,114
why an officer
from clubs and vice

775
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,825
was found dead
in Ruan's hotel room

776
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:21,863
with a gun in his hand.

777
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,907
- Yeah, I can't understand
what you were doing there.

778
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,905
I told you the hospital
was yours and nothing else.

779
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,077
- I had information.
I acted on it.

780
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,666
- Well, so did Harvey Crown.

781
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,285
Maybe he was checking out a lead
and needed protection.

782
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,912
- If it was
just a routine check,

783
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,504
if it was
just a couple of good old boys

784
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,089
doing their duty,
that's fine.

785
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,582
But why two officers
from separate divisions

786
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,629
twinning it?

787
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,547
Why did one of them run?

788
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,387
- What do you mean
two officers?

789
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,635
- Found it at the hotel.

790
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,806

- Of course I didn't.

794
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,487
I've got the press
jumping all over me.

795
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,734
I'm trying to run this division.

796
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,453
I don't need this shit as well,
do I?

797
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,115
- Jacob Sternwood was there too.

798
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,207
- Have you got evidence?

799
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,249
- He was there.

800
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,840
- Well, that's not good enough.

801
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,050
You better
get your facts straight.

802
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,633
I'll look into Nathan and Crown,

803
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,507
and you focus on Sternwood,
okay?

804
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,723
And you get back to me.

as a military contractor.

a connection with Sternwood.

There isn't one.

with something
he didn't understand.

841

And he paid the price.

He's got a good heart,

00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,890
unlike ours.

00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,753
I did something,
something I'm not proud of,

903
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,549
so you better be right
on this, Max.

904
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,099
I tapped Nathan's line.

905
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:49,516
Someone called him
about the Greigo Mar.

906
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,891
Nathan was-
Well, he was guarded.

907
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,937
He was paranoid.

908
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,232
He couldn't wait to get
off the phone quick enough.

909
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,650
They're meeting tonight.

910
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,950
They're meeting here.

911
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,948
I want you to go
and check it out.

912
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,209
Keep it contained, yeah?

913
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,880
- Yeah.

914
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,134
- Call me
when ifs through, yeah?

915
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,849
- Yeah.

916
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,857

- You fucking owe me for this.

919
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,431
- I'd say this makes us
fair and square.

920
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,524
The first one's in.

Why didn't you just kill me
in that tunnel?

called Dean Warns.

Harvey Crown,
and possibly...

1012
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,806

Thomas Geiger.

That girl...

Sarah, had written something
on her hand:

1015
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,486
Punch 1-1-9.

1016
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,740
Now, Dean Warns
was seen at the container yard

1017
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,536
with Otis Blake
the night of his murder.

1018
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,208
That place is separated
into three different docks:

1019
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,707
Turk, Acorn,
and the Punch.

1020
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,459
And that's what I know.

1021
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,336

are container coordinates.

1022
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,845
We used to bring diesel in
off the ships.

- We'll end this tonight.

1024
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:28,769
And when it's over,
you'll go to prison,

1025
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,396

01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,158
how you make big money working

1037
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:23,247
for some
private military contractor.

1038
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,787
- Kincade.
- Yeah, that's it.

1039
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,957
Says they pay you straight
into some European bank account

1040
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,170
so you don't pay no tax.

1041
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,005
- No tax.
- That's amazing, mate.

1042
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,710
What sort of thing
they have you do?

1043
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,969

- So when'd you turn up?
- Oh, not long ago, darling.

1047
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,732
They told me not to tell you,

1048
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,192
said you'd get a kick out of it.

1049
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,358
- Yeah, I wish you had, Nan.

1050
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,944
I'm busy tonight.

1051
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,319
- Come on, mate.

1052
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,240
Come and sit down.

1053
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,500
- Yeah, why not?

1054
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,220
- What could be more important

1055
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,813
than seeing your old squad,
darling?

1056

We know how busy Dean's
been keeping himself recently.

We were just telling
your old Nan

1059

how we were the only ones
to stick up for you,

1060
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,151
how we were the only ones
to speak up

1061
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,366
and voice our disgust when they
forced early retirement.

1062
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,655
- You were like a rock.

1063
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,994
- Smuggling guns in the coffins
of dead soldiers.

1064
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:45,409
- Yeah, you wouldn't be
involved in anything

1065
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:46,781
as sordid as that,
would you?

1066
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,282
- Let's hope it's all
behind us.

1067
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,037
- How's your son?

1068
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,711
I hear he's been getting himself
into a bit of stick.

1069
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:58,710
- Yeah, unfortunately,
Ruan passed away recently.

1070
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,837
- And that's why
we've come to see Dean.

1071
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:04,716
Take him down to the Punch
for a few drinks.

1072
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,513
See our old friend
Thomas Geiger.

1073
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:10,563
- So how do we do this?

1074
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,398
- Roy's feeling a bit rough.

1075
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,562
- I get terrible migraines.

1076
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,355
Feels like my head's
gonna explode.

1077
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,478
- He's gonna stay here
and keep her company.

1078
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,322
- You don't mind if I stay here
and relax, do you, Iris?

1079
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,737
- Course I don't,
handsome man like you.

Calamity Jane.

01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,073
- I can make us some more tea.

1082
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,197
- No, no, no, Iris,
you just stay right there.

1083
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:28,824
- Dean, what's going on?

1084
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,416
- It's all right, Nan.

1085
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,127
I'll tell you
why I'm a good soldier:

1086
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,585
Because of selfless commitment.

1087
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,339
Otis Blake,

1088
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:46,933
Ruan Sternwood,

1089
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:51,100
Harvey Crown, Sarah Hawks,

1090
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,769
all necessary casualties,

1091
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:56,188
all necessary fatalities
of this operation.

1092
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:58,152
- Or maybe we're just murderers,
plain and simple.

1093
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,772
- Well, that's where
you're wrong.

1094
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,899
I'm a superior soldier.

1095
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,742
- You're just
a hired fucking killer.

1096
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:08,204
- I want to settle things.

1097
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,448
When I close this down,

1098
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,494
it'll be because I put

1099
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:13,618
the operation
before my own needs.

1100
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,206
Told you before,
I'm wise to you...

1101
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:21,960
Max.

1102
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:24,303
You think that keeping
her hostage as collateral's

1103
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:28,049
gonna force me
into a corner.

1104
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:32,395
But none of you have been
where I have,

1105
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:33,980
seen what I've seen.

1106
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:37,977
None of you have
that selfless commitment.

1107
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:45,199
Not one of you possesses
what it takes...

1108
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,442
to actually put a bullet

1109
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,114
in the back
of that woman's head.

1110
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,157

Just close your eyes.

01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:39,287
[cell phone ringing]

1119
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,884
- Warns?

1120
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,549
- <i>I</i> need you to meet me.

1121
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,548
At the Punch
tonight at 12:00.

1122
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,970
Kincade want me
to move them out.

1123
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,183
Lewinsky's getting too close.

1124

<i>This could all explode
in our hands.</i>

1125
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,647
- No, I can't do it.
It's too risky for me.

1126
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,062
<i>- You meet me...</i>

1127
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:02,731
or I'll make sure all this lands
on your fucking head.

1128
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,978
- Why do you need me
to come down?

1129
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,980
<i>- Just fucking do it!</i>

1130
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,747
- Oh, fuck.

1131
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:21,332
How you doing?

1132
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,332
- [panting]

1133
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:27,923
I can't feel my legs, Jake.

1134
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:31,263
- Really?

1135
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,513
- Fuck off.
[laughs]

1136
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,931
- Oh, for fuck-

1137
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,770
No, you fuck off.
Jesus.

1138
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,769
- [groans forcefully]

1139
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:50,992
- You gonna be all right
staying here?

1140
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:52,030
- Yeah.

1141
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,620
[panting]

1142
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,364
I'm sorry for this, man.

1143
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,366
- No, no, no, you did good.

1144
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,788
You did good.

1145
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,456
No, I'm ...

1146
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,204
I'm sorry about your boy.

1147
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:07,792
- Yeah.

1148
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,506
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1149
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:16,259
the man who's going to lead
this party into government,

1150
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,602
our friend, our leader,

1151
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:19,970
Henry Callaghan.

1152
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:22,974
[scattered applause]

1153
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:28,863
- You're a very difficult woman
to track down all of a sudden.

1154
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,732
- It's a very busy time for me.

1155
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:37,201
- Warns wants
to meet me tonight.

1156
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:40,916
At the Punch.

1157
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:42,580
Who arranged this,
was it you?

1158
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,501
Kincade?

1159
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:46,918
Thought you had everything
you needed, you know,

1160
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:52,591
all the headlines you require,
am I right?

1161
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:55,886
Janey, you listening to me?

1162
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:59,511
Your little project
came apart at the seams.

1163
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:01,979
Max is an inch away
from piecing all this together,

1164
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,347
and Sternwood
is still at large,

1165
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,690
so you better pay attention.

1166
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,355
- Campaign's going very well.

1167
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:08,444
We're ahead in the polls,

1168
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:09,858
if that's what
you're referring to, Thom.

1169
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,199
- No, it's not what
I'm referring to.

1170
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,863
Who arranged tonight?

1171
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,327
- You've lost me,
I'm afraid.

1172
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:24,077
- You fuckin' bitch!

1173
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:26,125
People have died
because of this,

1174
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,088
because of us.

1175
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:31,050
I've lost men all because
of your fucking progress,

1176
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,294
and you sit there in denial
like some fucking royalty.

1177
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:35,216
You don't even have the class
to look me in the eye.

1178
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,714
- Thom, listen.

1179
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,468
I have to get this speech right
with Robert.

1180
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,431
I think you did the right thing.

1181
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,729
I hope this pans out
for you okay.

1182
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,358
- [scoffs]

1183
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,909
- Sorry to call you
on this number,

1184
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,003
but Warns
can't be reached.

1185
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,088
It seems
we've got a serious problem.

1186
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:50,792

You broke my fucking arm!

1192
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:17,041
- Thom.

1193
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,542
Thom.

1194
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,465
You tell me
what the fuck this is.

1195
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,839
- Don't make things
worse for yourself, Max, eh?

1196
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:24,339
Now, you stop this now,
and we can settle it.

1197
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:26,513
- You can't settle
the death of Sarah.

1198
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,887
You can't settle
trying to set me up for murder.

1199
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,729
- I am your commanding officer.

1200
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,723
Right now you're wanted
for the murder of your partner,

1201
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:34,350
so you're going to need
all the-

1202
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:38,396
Ah!

1203
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,239
- Those two boys...

1204
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:41,858
came here on the night
of the 7th

1205
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:43,074
to buy guns from him.

1206
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:46,070
- [shouts in pain]

1207
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,573
- He was
with Bartnick and Crown.

1208
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,700
And one of the boys, Blake,
recognized Crown.

1209
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,497
He'd been arrested by him
a year ago.

1210
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,586
And that compromised the deal.

1211
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:55,830
Blake died,

1212
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,923
but Ruan got away
with a hold-all full of money.

1213
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:01,590
You get your fucking hands
off me!

1214
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,133
Bartnick and Crown
went to the hotel

1215
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:06,098
looking for their money
and come across Sternwood,

1216
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,307
and you suddenly get worried

1217
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:09,598
that I'm gonna
piece things together.

1218
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,721
You, Thom,

1219
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:14,645
were meant to be my friend.

1220
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,272
This can't just be about money.

1221
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:21,029
Not for you.

1222
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,327
- Policemen
weren't meant to die.

1223
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:32,704
It was all gonna be simple.

1224
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,327
It was gonna change things,

1225
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,828
make things better for us.

1226
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:39,790
Robert Wiseman, he got it.

1227
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,259
Just one more gun scandal,

1228
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,969
and his party
would win the next election.

1229
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,010
- Jane Badham?

1230
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:50,760
- She found Warns.

1231
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:52,307
He shipped in the guns,

1232
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,601
set up Otis and Ruan
as buyers.

1233
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:59,944
I provided some manpower,
turned a blind eye, you know.

1234
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:02,153
Then a new squad would come in,

1235
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,114
arrest the two boys
with the guns.

1236
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:05,949
Big public outcry,

1237
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:07,158
Jane handles the PR.

1238
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,245
And Wiseman
takes the next election.

1239
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,249
- Kincade supplied Warns.

1240
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:15,413
Kincade'd get
the multimillion-pound contract

1241
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,127
to supply body armor,
training packages,

1242
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,461
and guns to the police.

1243
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:20,957
- Yeah.

1244
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,128
- What do you get, Thom?

1245
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:23,296
- On.

1246
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:24,509
- What'd you get?

1247
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:28,723
You get a healthy bank account?

1248
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,762
Get fast-tracked
to the role of...

1249
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:31,930
what?

1250
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:34,895
Commissioner?

1251
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:37,481
All for obedience
in the line of fucking duty.

1252
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:38,599
- Fuck off!

1253
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,021
You, more than anyone,

1254
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,521
should get
what's happening here, Max.

1255
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,364
I'm the one has to go
and see coppers' families
