00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,337
[Roy]
They even change the gauge.

182
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,541
You know, it's interesting, honey,

183
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,016
the Chinese didn't want
the Russians to invade,

184
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,076
so they made their tracks narrower.

185
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:19,215
Uh, you know,
the Russian gauge-- 5.6 feet,

186
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,920
which is, like, three inches wider
than the Chinese,

187
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,553
so these Chinese wheels gotta go.

188
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,860
Where'd they come from?

189
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:31,130
l don't know. Some machine tool
factory in Moscow, l suppose.

190
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,263
No, them-- our new cabin mates.

191
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,741
[Roy]
Oh, he said that they were
teaching in Japan--

192
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,176
English and maybe some Spanish--

193
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,010
Oh, honey, get a shot of that.
They're raising the train.

194
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,413
Get a shot.

195
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,279
You know what?
l suppose they keep

196
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,480
the bogies over there.

197
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,184
l don't know how they get them
onto that track and then under, but...

198
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,988
You know what?
lt's just amazing.

199
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,690
[people chattering]

200
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,130
- [Roy] Hey.
- Hey.

201
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,365
- Hi.
- Sit.

202
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,931
- Thanks.
- Come on over.

203
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,445
We're gonna get you some vodka.

204
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,811
So, how was Customs?

205
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,281
Oh, jeez!

206
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,751
You know, they really gave us
a bit of a hard time, Carlos.

207
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,516
What, you two? No way.

208
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,080
Yeah, well, they were suspicious
of our passports.

209
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,627
- What?
- May l see them, please?

210
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,684
Sure.

211
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,695
Okay.

212
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,256
[chuckles]

213
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,998
This is why, Roy. Look.
They're new. Brand-new.

214
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,131
A new passport is easy to forge.

215
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,038
There are fewer stamps
and visas to copy.

216
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,078
Hold on there.
Those are the real McCoy.
We just got those.

217
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,511
Hold on.
Let me show you mine.

218
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,544
This is the real McCoy.

219
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,415
- Oh.
- See?

220
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,387
- Well used.
- Yeah.

221
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,549
They're not accustomed
to see new passports.

222
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,854
What's Canada like?
l always wanted--

223
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,363
Let me tell you the secret
to getting through Customs
and across borders.

224
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:44,330
[Spanish]
Don't stand out.

225
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,540
You think it's obvious
that we're Americans?

226
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,836
[Roy]
Nah-- Well, she definitely looks American.

227
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,812
So you've done this trip before?

228
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,007
[Carlos]
<i>Sí</i>.

229
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,845
Train's cheaper than plane.

230
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,114

but my-- [Spanish]

231

232
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,257
The colder, the better, huh?

233
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,190
- You know?
- <i>Sí</i>.

234
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,356
[Roy laughs]

'cause it gets cold there.

235

[Man]
Here they are.

236
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,127
Hey, do you think it
maybe a little early to--

237
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,396
- Early?
- You know.

238
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,098
Roy, it's late.
lt's 3:00 a.m.

239

Trains run on Moscow time.

240

We have much catching up to do.

241
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,874
Not for me.

242
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,071
- No?
- No.

243
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,945
But it will melt the ice inside you.

No, l never really had much
of a home to miss.

So, uh, you were
helping kids in China?

266
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,033
Yes. Yeah.

l've never done anything

00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,529
Like what?

275
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:56,091
You know, lending a helping hand

276
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,796
and helping someone who's down.

277
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,429

00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,808
lt's more of just a hobby for now.

357
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,241
''For now.''

358
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,508
l don't know.
l might do a book someday.

359
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,947
l don't know.

360
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,484
l want to show you something.

361
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,530
Don't want those strange Polacks

362
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,361
looking in and getting ideas.

363
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,493
[speaking Spanish]

364
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,432
Wow.

365
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,134
No, not this one.

366
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,769
This one.

367
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,177
This is my favorite.

368
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,340
You see, all the others are smiling,

369
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,714
and this one is so sad.

370
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,220
l love these things.

371
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,660
See?

372
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,790
lt's sandalwood.

373
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:05,064
These are one of a kind.
Not for tourists.

374
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,333
They pay much money for these
in Amsterdam.

375
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,501
ls it legal-- reselling them?

376
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,840
Yeah. l mean,

377
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,473
little packages to Customs
now and then,

378
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,813
but it's legal.

379
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,648
They are Matryoshkas.

380
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,153
That means ''mother.''

381
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,711
- See the belly?
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,280
They celebrate fertility.

383
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,351
And now, there she is.

384
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,656
[Jessie chuckles]

385
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,857
The little bambina.

386
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,162
Look at it.

387
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,929
lsn't that cute?

388
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,562
[door clicks]

389
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,665
[knocking on door]

390
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,642
- [Abby] Carlos?
- Eh...

391
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,701
- Hold on.
- Carlos?

392
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,456
l had to lock it.

393
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:03,551
Fucking Polacks keep coming in
like they're invited.

394
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,220
Hi, Abby.

395
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,696
[Abby]
Hey.

396
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,399
[knocking on door]

397
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,905
- Well? What did l tell you?
- [lock clicks]

398
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,507
Next stop, lrkutsk!

399
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,573
Come on. Let's go.

400
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,227
[chattering in native language]

401
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,738
- [Abby] They have everything here.
- [Jessie] Where's the baby?

402
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,373
- Oh, the pirozhki's really good.
- They are?

403
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,609
- Yeah.
- Should we get one?

404
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,173
- Yeah.
- No. Wait. lt's my treat.

405
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,651
Here they are.

406
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,621
Take a look at this, Carlos.

407
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:08,056
Wow! Coal-burners!

408
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,390
l'm in heaven!

409
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,123
- [laughing]
- You like them?

410
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,960
- [Abby] So who said that?
- [Jessie] What?

411
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,764
''Kill all my demons,
and my angels might die, too.''

412
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,863
Tennessee Williams said it.

413
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,271
l like it.

414
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,672
Yeah?

415
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,179
l saw you have a journal.
Are you a writer?

416
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,509
- No.
- No?

417
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,449
No. lt's more like a travel diary.

418
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,179
Uh-huh.

419
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,278
Well, l bet you got
some good stories.

420
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,982
l sure did.

421
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,893
Yeah. None of them
l'm too proud of.

422
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,956
l left home when l was 16.

423
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,729
Maybe for the same reasons as you.
l don't know.

424
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,666
Spun my wheels into my late 20s.

425
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,341
Never spent more than a week
in one place.

426
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,978
No. Wait. l'm wrong.

427
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,243
There was jail in Memphis
for nine days,

428
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,715
and, uh, detox.

429
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,253
That was two weeks, l think.

430
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,522
This was all pre-Roy, of course.

431
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,595
So, how'd you two meet?

432
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,357
How'd we meet?

433
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,729
Well, Roy likes to say
we met by accident.

434
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,066
l was drunk,
and l swerved into his truck head-on,

435
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,128
going 40 miles an hour.

436
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:33,333
- [Roy] Beautiful, huh?
- l saw many like that in Rajasthan.

437
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,072
- Where's, uh--
- lndia.

438
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,377
Oh, wow. You've been
pretty much everywhere, huh?

439
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,886
Life is a journey, right?
Not a destination.

440
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,420
l like that.

441
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,581
That sounds like something
Jess would say.

442
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,648
- Really?
- Yeah.

443
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,660
She's still a bit-- l don't know.

444
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,958
What's the word? Restless.

445
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,327
Yeah.

446
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,491
Okay. So, this trip--

447
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,434
the Trans-Siberian--
it was her idea.

448
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,993
No, that was me.

449
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,471
You see, we never travel anywhere,

450
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,668
and, so, when the church
gave us this chance,

451
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,235
l thought it would be
a perfect opportunity

452
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,781
to impress her with a big adventure.

453
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,147
You know, make her happy.

454
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,848
She seems happy to me.

455
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,357
Well, tell you the truth, Carlos,

456
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,292
we've been having problems lately--

457
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,829
marital problems.
[sniffles]

458
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,832
Oh. l'm sorry to hear it.

459
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,994
l think she thinks l just

460
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,564
play it a bit safe sometimes.

461
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,871
Before l met Jess, l thought

462
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,140
l was the wild one.

463
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,010
[chuckles]

464
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:48,519
l'm not sure she expected
to end up with a hardware store owner,

465
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,453
you know, much less one
with a train set

466
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,753
in his basement, but...

467
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,184
l love her so.

468
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,324
Oh, Carlos,

469
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,064
you gotta check out this boiler.

470
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,835
What a beauty.

471
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,742
lsn't she gorgeous?

472
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,349
[Jessie]
He came to the hospital every day.

473
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,452
There was no one else.

474
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,555
l pretty much pissed off
everyone else in my life by that point.

475
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,123
He said something to me one day
l'll never forget.

476
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,898
He said, ''No matter what your aim''--
No. Wait.

477
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,202
''No matter what your dream in life,
no matter what your goal,

478
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,710
keep your eye upon the doughnut
and not upon the hole.''

479
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,645
- [chuckling]
- What's that supposed to mean?

480
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,012
l don't know, but it's so Roy.

481
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,551
No, l guess it's like--

482
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,553
You know, if you--

483
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,717
lf you focus on the positive,
you can do amazing things in your life.

484
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,028
Before we met, l was a bit
too focused on the negative.

485
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,366
No, l'm not saying settling down
solves everything, you know?

486
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,802
lt's-- Roy and l are so different
in many ways.

487
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,135
He wants kids, for instance.
A family, you know?

488
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,281
l mean, l do, too.
Of course l do, too. lt's just-- lt's--

489
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,813
lt's just such a huge thing to--

490
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,547
Plant a root?

491
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,414
[chuckles]

492
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,151
Yeah.

493
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,555
l want a family.

494
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,099
But l'd get it right,
you know?

495
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,794
There's this place in Vancouver
on a lake--

496
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,303
this cottage.

497
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:51,274
lt's got this long wooden dock
that you can go out and sit on.

498
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:56,040
Surrounded by the mountains,
and it's quiet.

499
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,082
No one else is around.

500
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,141
Sounds nice.
ls it a family place?

501
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,847
Yeah, my grandfather's.
Well, he actually sold it

502
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,823
to pay for his trips to Reno.

503
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,621
[chuckles]

504
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,821
l'm gonna buy it back.

505
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,357
Wow. Vancouver on a lake.
Sounds expensive.

506
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,893
Yeah, l'm working on it.

507
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,734
With Carlos?

508
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,633
[Jessie]
l'm sorry. That was none of my business.

509
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,580
We should get back on.

510
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,138
Yeah.

511
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,275
Hey, it was good
talking to you, Abby.

512
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,082
Yeah, you, too.

513
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,350
Yeah. Thanks.

514
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,232
<i>** [faint music over P.A. system]</i>

515
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,201
[sighs]

516
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,629
[knocking on door]

517
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,302
Roy? You there?

518
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,710
[shouting in native language]

519
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,750
[door slams shut]

520
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,216
Excuse me.
Have you seen my husband?

521
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,682
[speaking in native language]

522
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,157
You can't keep doing that.

523
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,788
- We have five more days before--
- Roy's gone.

524
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,195
What?

525
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,961
l just looked up and down the whole train.
He's not on it.

526
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,936
- Well-- Here. Sit down.
- Didn't he get back on with you?

527
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,471
No.

528
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,200
Oh, shit!

529
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,572
We looked at the old trains.

530
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,611
Then l left to get some food.

531
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,771
Maybe he didn't hear the bell.

532
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,439

Oh boy, does that feel good.

Car 2, Cabin 4.

Hey. You all right?

Just cold.

798
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,294
Where's your coat?

[laughs] You are so silly.

801
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:10,892
Come on.
Let's get on the train.

802
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,299
Can you believe it's snowing?

803
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:17,101
You know the guy that l'm staying with--
Carlos Ximénez. Do you know where he is?

804
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,801
He left this morning by bus

805
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,573
with the American woman Nassir.

806
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:27,946
[scoffs] Did they say
when they were gonna be back?

807
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,884
They are back.
She just left to the station

808
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,251
to meet her husband train.

809
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:36,986
<i>Tovarich</i>.
That means ''comrade.''

810
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,961
Our new cabin mate's
been teaching me some Russian.

811
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:43,226
l had them phone the hotel
in Moscow

812
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:47,201
and they know
we're gonna be a day late.

813
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:51,673
But there's still two days
to see the Red Square,

814
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,370
and the Kremlin and the--

815
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,107
Well, you really didn't
sleep a wink, did ya?

816
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,742
Was it that bad?

817
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,218
- What?
- Your hotel.

818
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:09,054
Sweetie, l swear to you.
Mine was like a gulag.

819
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:13,186
And you know the stock room
in the basement at the store?

820
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,457
lt was half that size.

821
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:18,365
No windows and--
oh, here we go!

822
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,633
And, oh, this is the best part.
Okay?

823
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,003
The phone rings 3:00 in the morning.

824
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:29,443
lt's reception asking,
''Do you want a prostitute?''

825
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,740
[laughs]

826
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:34,841
l mean, apparently it's normal here.
But it threw me for a loop.

827
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,819
l mean, l--

828
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,912
she was...
good at what she did.

829
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,820
[laughs] Just kidding you.

830
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:47,523
Sweetie? You all right?

831
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,531
You-- you sure you're okay, sweetie?

832
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,195
Yeah. [sighs]

833
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,532
Yeah.

835
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,981
Oh, there he is.

836
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,779

00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:12,049
- Ah, <i>tovarich, tovarich</i>.
- You must be Jessie.

838
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:16,888
Yeah, oh, this is Elia Grinko.
He's our new bunk mate.

839
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,293
- Hi.
-My colleague tells me he is too busy

840
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:23,127
and cannot join me for early dinner.

841
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,963
May l ask you to accept my invitation?

842
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:29,630
l am-- <i>tak,</i> oh, it is-- famished.

843
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:30,798
[laughs] Famished is right.

844
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:34,708
Yeah, we're happy to join you.
ls that all right, sweetie?

845
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,904
ls the dining car even open?

846
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,505
l'm afraid my watch doesn't work.

847
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,176
Mine's fine.
And oh, we're in luck.

848
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:46,120
- lt's almost 5:00.
- Almost 5:00.

849
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:51,825
Here l am trying to explain the situation
to the station master

850
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,659
and Elia appears out of nowhere

851
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,323
and starts translating.

852
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,924
Your husband is lucky guy.

853
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:02,597
[laughs] His English is excellent,
don't you think, honey?

854
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,232
My son encouraged me.

855
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:10,974
He...he liked your country.
He was going to be in diplomatic service.

856
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,218
[speaking Russian]

857
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:20,416
Well, hold on there, Elia.
Can policemen drink while on duty?

858
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,890
Well, we won't tell my boss, hey?

859
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:24,620
No, thanks.

860
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,218
Don't be shy.

861
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,992
- You're a cop.
- A detective, Jess.

862
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:33,195
<i>Da</i>. With FSKN, like your
Bureau of Narcotics.

863
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:36,238
Elia is on his way
to a big conference in Moscow

864
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,967
all the way from Vladivostok.

865
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,976
ln Soviet days, official like me

866
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:43,239
would get plane ticket first class.

867
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,111
Now, seven days on train.

868
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,377
- <i>Na Zdorovie</i>
- <i>Na Zdorovie</i>

869
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,112
Hold on there, Elia.

870
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:53,246
Don't tell me that you miss
the U.S.S.R.?

871
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:56,759
l mean, the U.S.S.R. was
a dark, evil empire.

872
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:57,815
Maybe so.

873
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:01,762
But then we were people living
in the darkness.

874
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,356
Now we are a people
dying in the light.

875
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,765
Which is better?

876
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:09,464
When it was U.S.S.R.,
man lived to age 65 years.

877
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,404
Now it is 58 years.

878
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,237
l know this fact very well.

879
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,776
l am 58.

880
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:18,041
ln Russia now we say there are
only two kinds of people--

881
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,550
those who leave in private jet,

882
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,712
those who leave in coffin.

883
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:27,486
Which are you?

884
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:30,321
l am too old to leave.

885
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,190
Just do my job.

886
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:35,788
Which is catching
the bad guys, huh, Elia?

887
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,696
Right, Roy.

888
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:41,066
Well, who are they?
Who are the bad guys?

889
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,264
Ten years ago, it was easy.

890
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:46,331
Drivers bring heroin
from Kabul in back of truck.

891
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,809
We catch them, so they get smart.

892
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:53,474
They add special chemical to heroin,
mold it into objects--

893
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:58,509
souvenirs, handicrafts, small toys.

894
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,488
They pay people-- mules,

895
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:01,955
l think you call them--

896
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,959
who can travel easily with drugs.

897
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:07,656
They use students, old babushkas.

898
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:11,029
People who look innocent,
but are really not.

899
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,495
Hmm? These are bad guys.

900
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,037
Hey.

901
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:19,563
Jess, Abby and-- ahem--

902
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:21,735
shoot, what was his name?
The Spaniard.

903
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:24,869
Carlos.

904
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:27,939
The backpackers you told me about
who shared your cabin.

905
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,382
Yes, Abby and Carlos.

906
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,046
Do you think they could
have been mules?

907
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:35,352
Why, the past year, this line
has become major traffic route.

908
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,859
You know, Elia,
now that l think about it,

909
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:40,896
this couple
seemed to know an awful lot

910
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,555
about forging passports

911
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,497
and sneaking over borders
and whatnot.

912
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,330
This Abby and Carlos.

913
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:49,030
l mean, at least that's what they
said their names were.

914
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:54,702
This couple-- did they seem
suspicious to you, Jessie?

915
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,574
No, just young.

916
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:59,342
And they were going
where, Moscow?

917
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,383
They never said.

918
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:05,182
So you left them on the train

919
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:09,088
when you got off in Ulyanovsk?

920
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:11,517
Yeah.

921
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,990
[vomiting]

922
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,369
Well, you feeling better?

923
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:30,707
Yeah.

924
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:36,276
Oh, good. You're lucky you didn't
have that Russian vodka.

925
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:37,614
Hmm.

926
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,815
ln the end you're lucky
you're not drinking, you know?

927
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,825
So what did you think of Elia?

928
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:47,721
Now, l know what you're thinking.

929
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,526
l mean, he's a persistent SOB,

930
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,591
but bet you he always gets his man.

931
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:55,364
Hey, buddy, we were just
talking about you.

932
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,905
Only good, l hope.

933
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,065
Oh, yeah.

934
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,836
Oh, please. Allow me.

935
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,001
Oh, no, that's okay.
l've got it.

936
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,101
- Jessie. Jessie.
- No, that's okay.

937
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,646
- No, really.
- Let him get it. lt's okay.

938
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:05,840
- Let go.
- Okay.

939
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:08,475
- He's got it.
- Thank you.

940
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,746
She's a headstrong woman.
You know how that goes.

941
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:16,149
Hey, how many days
to Moscow, Elia?

942
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,658
Three more days, Roy.

943
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,695
Whoo! Amazing.

944
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:22,094
You want to stay on train forever.

945
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,325

01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:05,913
- Yeah.
- He gave these to you?

1061
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,541
- Yeah.
- Huh.

1062
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,380
[dogs barking, yelling in Russian]

1063
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,579
[gasping, crying]

1064
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:15,589
Jess?

1065
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,386
- No. He didn't.
- Jess.

1066
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,290
Oh, God!

1067
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:23,263
- [sobbing]
- lt's okay, baby.

1068
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:26,529
lt's okay. lt's okay.

1069
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,121
Heroin.

1070
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,495
Oh, Lord.

1071
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,601
How did Carlos get a doll into your bag?

1072
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,643
He came into my room.

1073
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,575
l let him.
His shower wasn't working.

1074
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:11,908
He wanted to use mine.

1075
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,438
So l left the room
and saw police searching the hotel.

1076
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,747
Carlos must have seen them, too.

1077
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:21,256
l think he got scared
and that must have been

1078
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:25,157
when he...did it.

1079
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:28,321
What then?

1080
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:31,025
l went to the lobby
and l waited for a call from Roy.

1081
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:35,661
lt was there that l saw the two of them
leave and go off together.

1082
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,613
Jessie...

1083
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:54,350
why did you tell me
they did not get off train with you?

1084
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:59,523
Just got scared.

1085
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:00,892
Why?

1086
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:04,091
l got scared for Abby.

1087
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,693
l got to know Abby.
She's a good girl, okay.

1088
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:10,533
So when you asked me
those questions, l froze.

1089
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:15,669
l didn't want anything to happen to her
because of what Carlos did.

1090
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:19,202
She's not part of it.
She didn't even know Carlos had the dolls.

1091
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,977
How do you know this?

1092
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:24,814
He told me.

1093
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,082
He showed me the dolls.

1094
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:30,522
When you were alone with him?

1095
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,622
Yes.

1096
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:40,999
And later,
when l found the dolls in my bag--

1097
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:44,300
[clears throat] She got--
She panicked, Elia.

1098
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:48,070
You just told her about
how the smugglers operate

1099
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:53,137
and she got scared and--
lt can happen to anyone.

1100
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,876
<i>Da</i>.

1101
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:59,444
Fear can drive one to irrational acts.

1102
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:02,388
ln Russia, we know this very well.

1103
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:05,654
Our history is a history
of irrational acts.

1104
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,226
So...that's it?

1105
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:16,636
Mmm, apart from, l'm afraid,
one formality.

1106
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,749
Ahh.

1107
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,421

1108
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:34,921

01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:38,254

What will you do
if you find them, Elia?

1113
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:49,601
First, we must find them, Roy.

1114

Jess, l love you.

1135
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,271
That means we should be able
to tell each other everything.

1136
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:07,213
No secrets.

Of course there's no

Elia, what do you want?
You have your drugs.

01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:28,682
Not my drugs, Roy.

1210
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:31,691
You think this is about
couple kilos heroin?

1211
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:35,752
His boss moves
20, 50 kilos heroin every day.

1212
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,355
- Aah!
- He expects sometimes his mules--

01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:41,300
- Ohh!
- To run off with deliveries.

1214
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:44,964
He does not expect them to steal money.
That he does not like.

- No! Don't! Stop!

You describe Abby how?

''Good girl,'' no?

1222
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:09,463
Does ''good girl'' recruit boyfriend?

1223
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,796
Does she pretend to love him--

1224
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:15,597
- [whispers] lt's not true.
- So that he will stick knife--

1225
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:19,902
this knife-- into head of man
so she can steal his money?

1226

- [gasping]
- Murder a man.

1228

One, Abby does not know
where Carlos is.

Two, she does not have the money.

1233

So...this is my theory.

1234

01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:31,348
Those are his priors.

1412
01:40:31,425 --> 01:40:33,393
Theft, possession, sexual assault.

1413
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:37,055
Trafficking is a new bag for him.

1414
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:39,463
Well, you think you'll find him?

1415
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:43,025
Someone will.
Us first, if he's lucky.

1416
01:40:43,103 --> 01:40:44,502
Mmm.

1417
01:40:44,571 --> 01:40:46,004
And her?

1418
01:40:46,073 --> 01:40:48,371
Abby Brunell. 20 years old.

1419
01:40:48,442 --> 01:40:50,410
Last known address Seattle.

1420
01:40:50,477 --> 01:40:52,445
Haven't been able
to track down any family.

1421
01:40:52,513 --> 01:40:54,504
Ah, just another lost kid.

1422
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:56,947
Made the mistake
of falling for the wrong guy.

1423
01:40:57,017 --> 01:40:58,746
Well, like you told us
in your statements.

1424
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:00,548
Which are-- oh, yeah.
Here we go.

1425
01:41:00,621 --> 01:41:05,251
Yep. All nicely printed out
in easy-to-read English.

1426
01:41:05,325 --> 01:41:07,293
What's gonna happen to her?

1427
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:09,886
Ah, soon as she's fit,
she'll be sent back to the states.

1428
01:41:09,963 --> 01:41:12,158
At the taxpayer's expense.

1429
01:41:12,232 --> 01:41:14,826
Now, your signature here

1430
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:17,598
means that you swear it's all truthful.

1431
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:30,609
Just right here, Mr. Nassir.

1432
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:32,652
[clears throat]

1433
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:54,167
Roy?

1434
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:57,474
l need to see her.

1435
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:09,753
[beeping]

1436
01:42:25,839 --> 01:42:28,239
Hi.

1437
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:34,771
l want to tell you something, okay?

1438
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:43,250
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1439
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:46,724
You all right?

1440
01:42:46,793 --> 01:42:48,420
Mm-hmm.

1441
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:57,062
What'd you say to her?

1442
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:03,672
Just something you once told me.

1443
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:05,871
ln the hospital.

1444
01:43:08,081 --> 01:43:10,049
[laughs] Oh, you're kidding.

1445
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:11,414
The doughnut thing?

1446
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:13,316
[laughter]

1447
01:43:13,387 --> 01:43:15,981
Honey, l don't even know
what that means.

1448
01:43:16,056 --> 01:43:18,581
l just was trying to cheer you up

1449
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:20,650
to make you look on the bright side.

1450
01:43:24,565 --> 01:43:26,430
l know.

1451
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,491
Ahh.

1452
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:36,206
[chuckles]

1453
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:45,081
lt's sure gonna be nice
to be back home.

1454
01:43:48,021 --> 01:43:49,682
[sighs]

1455
01:43:52,459 --> 01:43:56,919
[child's laughter, noises]

1456
01:43:56,997 --> 01:43:58,988
[chuckles]

1457
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:02,092
- [babbling]
- Max! Max, come here.

1458
01:44:02,169 --> 01:44:04,399
Leave her alone.

1459
01:44:04,471 --> 01:44:05,733
l'm sorry.

1460
01:44:05,806 --> 01:44:06,932
That's okay.

1461
01:44:07,007 --> 01:44:08,235
Stay in your seat, honey.

1462
01:44:18,785 --> 01:44:22,846
lt's okay.

1463
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:25,756
[cawing]
