1
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:14,180
No, Bubs. I mean, there's gotta be rules,
or else things get fucked up.

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,599
Ain't no rules with dope fiends.

3
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,851
When the police got you shackled up,

4
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,770
you make a move, right?
You help yourself out.

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,691
- But to just start snitchin' for no reason...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,695
Let me track this. You hypopulatin'
that you can tattletale when you locked up

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,364
but you can't do it
straight up for the money?

8
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,617
I mean, no offense, son,
but that's some weak-ass thinkin'.

9
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,078
You equivocatin' like a motherfuck.

10
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,623
OK, so a snitch is a snitch, right?

11
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,709
- There you go.
- So why be one, man?

12
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,711
We're gettin' by with our capers.

13
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:49,465
We gettin' by out here rippin' and runnin'
and ain't got shit to show for it.

14
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,761
It's part of bein' a soldier, right?
That's what you say.

15
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,013
That's why I put all this mileage in these feet.

16
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,974
You wait till you ain't a pup no more.

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,812
See if you ain't lookin' for something
a little more steady for your own self.

18
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,235
What the fuck? You ill already?

19
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,404
It's ain't even past morning.

20
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,323
I'm cool, man. I'm fine.

21
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:18,327
Look, we hook up with my girl Kima,
we get paid, you gonna be better.

22
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,497
Fuck that, Bubs, all right?
I'm not a fuckin' snitch.

23
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,584
You know, I could argue the other side -

24
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,044
say if you drop dime
to duck a charge, you a snitch.

25
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,131
You do it as a living, you a professional.

26
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,763
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
You see that ladder right there?

27
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,933
Just like old times, man.
I'll be the bad guy, you be the Lone Ranger.

28
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:45,438
Leave that man be.
We get paid more hooking up to my girl.

29
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,732
But that's cash money right there.

30
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,784
With the white man, I best be the bad guy.
That way he ain't confused.

31
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,869
All right, meet me in the alley.

32
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,622
Fuck.

33
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,338
- Yo, mister.
- Yo.

34
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,424
Throw down your wallet,
or I'll jerk this ladder right out.

35
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,967
- What? No!
- I ain't playing.

36
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,804
- Throw down the goddamn money.
- No, please. Help!

37
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:18,971
OK!

38
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,808
Hey!
Leave that man alone!

39
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,694
Oh! Thank you.

40
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,822
It's crazy, man.

41
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,825
- What's that guy doing?
- Shit.

42
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,660
- Here.
- I can't.

43
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,537
No, you saved my ass.

44
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,122
It's appreciated, you know.

45
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,551
Yo, Bubs, you won't fuckin' believe this.

46
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,513
Bubs.

47
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,901
When you walk through the garden

48
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,780
You gotta watch your back

49
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,701
Well, I beg your pardon

50
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,871
Walk the straight and narrow track

51
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,330
Walk the straight
and narrow track

52
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:30,376
If you walk with Jesus

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,712
He's gonna save your soul

54
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,883
You gotta keep the devil

55
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,761
Way down in the hole

56
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,473
He got fire and the fury

57
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,100
Fire and fury

58
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,936
At his command

59
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,024
Well, you don't have to worry

60
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,777
Hold on to Jesus' hands

61
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,864
Oh, we'll be safe from Satan

62
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,409
When the thunder rolls

63
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,493
Oh

64
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,997
You gotta keep the devil

65
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,542
Way down in the hole

66
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,929
You gotta keep the devil

67
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,973
Way down in the hole

68
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,978
Way down

69
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,689
Way down in the hole

70
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,750
Dennis, you up? Dennis!

71
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,545
Mee-maw, hey.

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,008
- Guess you're not workin' today, huh?
- I'm workin' nights now.

73
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,762
At a bar. Workin' the door.

74
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,765
You know, it's just...

75
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,727
- Just till I find something a little bit better.
- Yeah?

76
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,940
Reminds me.
Your friend called again this morning.

77
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,443
She said for you to remember
your appointment.

78
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,073
Says there's a job in it, if you still lookin'.

79
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,263
So Marlo, right?

80
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,725
He got this one boy watchin' his back,
name be Chris Partlow.

81
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,268
Bartlow with a B?

82
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,562
"Part" like white people got in their hair.

83
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,648
- And "low" like a low-bottom dope fiend.
- Partlow.

84
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,651
- Yeah, what I said.
- So he's Marlo's muscle.

85
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,904
So, what...

86
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,621
- How much is that worth?
- Five, if I can work up a photo ID.

87
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:20,963
- The boy, Fruit, he used that.
- Fruit who runs one of Marlo's corners?

88
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,798
- Careful, it got prints.
- Prints?

89
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,634
Look at you, gettin' all CSI on me and shit.

90
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,221
A burner with prints,
that gotta mean cash money, right?

91
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,767
If I could pull a print, get Fruit ID'd,
I can go to $10.

92
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,731
And if I show you
where Marlo hides his Mercedes?

93
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,025
Benz would go for 15.

94
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,694
You don't know it, but these are hard times.

95
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,571
You killing me out here, girl.

96
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,532
All right. 25 for the Benz.

97
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,911
You good peoples.

98
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:56,540
So let's total up. We at 40, right?

99
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,673
- Here, bank that for me.
- Bank it? For what?

100
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,550
Got me a plan, girl.

101
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,678
The hoppers here only be
wearing them big white T-shirts

102
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,722
a couple of times before they chuck 'em.

103
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,809
So I'm thinkin',
while I'm out here working for y'all,

104
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,854
I sell them shirts on the corner.
I'll make my nut comin' and goin'.

105
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,084
I don't know what more
you could have done.

106
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,752
Charlie's right, boss.

107
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,464
- You tried.
- Fucking hoodleheads won't cooperate.

108
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,591
You give them their own block or two,

109
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,845
offering them a place to sell drugs in peace,
and do they listen?

110
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,805
It's a damn shame too, 'cause if it worked,

111
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,850
you might have had a positive effect
on the community.

112
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,602
Shift commander,
call the front desk.

113
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,147
You guys are some lying sacks of shit.

114
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,651
- I'm saying, sir...
- I'm guessing...

115
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,071
that you have some thoughts
on where we should go from here.

116
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,909
Well, sir, we were thinking
a modified zebra operation.

117
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,122
Jump-outs from sector to sector,
and a zero-tolerance approach.

118
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,333
We detail a couple of men from each shift,
build a flex unit,

119
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,794
double up on head-knocking
and corner-clearing.

120
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,505
- More of the same, you mean.
- But better.

121
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,965
Better?

122
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,718
Better than nothing.

123
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,619
Ah, fuck this bullshit already.

124
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,414
Man, they gave us 15 cases of legal

125
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:04,001
but they shorted us on the colored bonds.
What's going on, man?

126
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,299
Yo. I got this.

127
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,431
- Officer.
- Detective, String.

128
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,893
You remember. Bird trial.
Detective McNulty.

129
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:25,356
You want something copied, man?
Search warrant, court papers?

130
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
- Anything I can do to help, you know.
- I ain't seen you around the way.

131
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,905
I'm not around the way no more.
You wanna find me, I'm right here.

132
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,908
- Right here, huh?
- Mm-hm.

133
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,911
This and some real estate
I'm working on is all.

134
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,497
More than enough to occupy me, really.

135
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,506
- Say, where you livin', man?
- Where am I livin'?

136
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,549
If you thinkin' of comin' downtown,

137
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,928
I got some condos
about to come on the line in eight months.

138
00:09:56,012 --> 00:10:00,140
You say the word, I'm gonna hook you up
something nice by the Hippodrome.

139
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,435
Loft apartments. Real nice.

140
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,694
You disappoint me, String.
I had such fuckin' hopes for us.

141
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,612
Have a nice day, Officer.

142
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,915
You see this shit?

143
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,003
Remember that kid who got shot
in Lake Clifton a couple months back?

144
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,089
Drug feud, right? What about it?

145
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,675
Last night,
they just found the only eyewitness

146
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,052
in an alleyway, bunch of holes in him.

147
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,431
- And?
- What do you mean, "And?"

148
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,100
You're talkin' about a state's witness.

149
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,437
You let a witness get killed
in a case like this, it says...

150
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,648
- "The city's broke and can't be fixed."
- Uh-oh.

151
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,027
- Sounds like we found an issue.
- Fuck the politics for a minute.

152
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,739
This is something
we all need to be on the same page with.

153
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,241
I'm serious, Tony.

154
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,661
You let shit like this stand,
pretty soon you got nothing left.

155
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,748
You gonna go public
and bang the mayor with it?

156
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,917
You gonna bang Burrell
and the state's attorney, then?

157
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,502
I ain't gonna bang nobody.

158
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,547
Like I said, fuck the politics for once.

159
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,508
But there is a problem here,
and I'm gonna help fix it.

160
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,428
You want your cape
and the little red underpants?

161
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,890
Or you stash that shit in the phone booth?

162
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,019
I always wondered about that.

163
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,654
- Man, I'd like a piece of that.
- You'd like any piece at all.

164
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,991
- Nigger, I'd like a piece of your mother.
- Stop fuckin' around.

165
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,951
I ain't started that shit.

166
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,289
Yo, now she got our boy
with his nose wide open.

167
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,168
He's stealing from us
and she most likely the reason for it.

168
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,381
Y'all stay with the girl.
She'll soon enough show us the money.

169
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,800
Where you goin'?

170
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,428
I got something I gotta do.

171
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,472
You supposed to be here with us.

172
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,892
Y'all stay with the girl.
I'll get back with y'all down the way.

173
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,646
- Say what?
- I made a date a while back,

174
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,648
got to keep.

175
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,567
Man made a date, got to keep.

176
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,823
We find out he pussy-whipped
like this motherfucker over here.

177
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,827
Now, once again, from the data,

178
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,996
- when are most cars stolen?
- Sir, at night.

179
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:33,961
And your unit, which I believe is charged
with deterring the theft of autos,

180
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,504
when do you work?

181
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,007
The day shift, eight to four.
But, sir, as I tried to explain...

182
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:47,975
You effect more arrests of car thieves
during the daylight than at night.

183
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:53,772
You see, our ears work, we heard you.
But the question becomes -

184
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,442
- why the fuck can't you hear us?
- Sir, I don't...

185
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:01,196
The Commissioner is attempting to move
this department into the 21 st century.

186
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,492
That means preventing crime
by relying on computer-generated data,

187
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,704
not on your
fly-by-your-fucked-up-ass instinct.

188
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,626
Give me the auto-theft numbers
for downtown parking lots on Friday nights.

189
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,046
Sir, I have to check that.

190
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,344
Where are we with the gun?

191
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,555
Colonel, I was made to understand

192
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,808
that recovering Officer Dozerman's
weapon was a priority.

193
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,562
The gun, yes, we're on it, sir.
Making progress as we speak.

194
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,648
Lieutenant?

195
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,735
Sir, I now understand
that prevention is the way to go,

196
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,322
and we'll immediately
change our hours to reflect the data.

197
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,407
All right, Lieutenant.

198
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,077
Fecal gravity.

199
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,373
You beat on the right people
and the shit rolls down the hill.

200
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,393
- Dennis, is it?
- Cutty works for me.

201
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,811
Cutty, then.

202
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,527
So it's just gonna be us here?

203
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,322
- You know, I mean, Grace...
- Sister Grace called on your behalf,

204
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,158
but to my knowledge,
she didn't plan to be here.

205
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,410
She's a beautiful woman.

206
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:35,040
A man might say things he didn't mean
to stand closer to a woman like that.

207
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,045
You're in the job market, though,
I understand.

208
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,339
A couple of questions.

209
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,925
You got a high-school diploma, GED?

210
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,595
Any work experience?

211
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:54,643
I worked in a warehouse
for a couple of months back in, like, '86.

212
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,145
How do you see the church helping you?

213
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:03,944
Maybe get me some jobs or put my name
on a list or something. I don't know.

214
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,196
To tell you up front,
we don't do that here.

215
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,657
You want a job,
you'll have to work to get it.

216
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,076
We'll help, but it's gonna be your sweat.

217
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,747
With that said, then, the first thing
is to get you enrolled in a GED program.

218
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:20,002
Look, I don't mean to put you out,
but this...

219
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,130
this ain't how I thought it was gonna play.

220
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,433
Me, Oscar, a bunch of the guys...

221
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,101
we seen it.

222
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,937
Couldn't help it.

223
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,690
They practically ran right past us.

224
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,443
And the victim, the girl, had a gun.

225
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,862
Whose side was she on?

226
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,407
Couldn't tell.
They weren't doin' slow motion.

227
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,493
Did any of 'em have a big scar?

228
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,956
Do you think you'd be able to recognize
any of them?

229
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,834
- Just Omar.
- So you know Omar?

230
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,919
Omar came up around here.

231
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,174
That's good, Bruiser, very good.

232
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,636
- You do know Omar has a scar, right?
- He do?

233
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,474
We better go to my office,
put this down on paper. Come on.

234
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,897
Officer. Excuse me, Officer.

235
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,693
Is this North and Pulaski?

236
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,989
Cos I could fucking swear Dozerman
was shot up at North and Pulaski.

237
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,533
No, wait, let me guess.

238
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,827
The pursuit of your fellow officer's
service weapon

239
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,871
has led you to this fine citizen.

240
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,833
Tell me, kind sir, do you know
the whereabouts of said officer's weapon?

241
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,335
I didn't think so.

242
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,712
Calls from the detention center.

243
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,466
Some kind souls begging to assist you

244
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,344
in your foundering investigation.

245
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,096
Oop!

246
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,975
Let me just grand-jury my man here,
lock in his story.

247
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,230
Now for the gun. Later for his story.
And that's your sergeant talking.

248
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,750
Wipe your nose, yo.

249
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,878
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit.

250
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,968
Motherfucker, you scared the shit out of us
comin' up like that.

251
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,595
This shit do make you paranoid, yo.

252
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,433
- Go on, nigger, hit this shit.
- No, man, I gotta drop urine tomorrow.

253
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,227
You worried about that?

254
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,479
Go ahead, nigger. We got that covered.

255
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,314
Oh, you got that covered?

256
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,568
What, you think
you're the only motherfucker on parole?

257
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,906
- Yo, nigger, give me that shit.
- There you go.

258
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:09,921
- All right. What was her day?
- She caught a hack up to Towson Town Mall.

259
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,425
Hit two jewelry stores
and came back with bags from both.

260
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,761
By the time she caught up with our boy,

261
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,764
she was wearing one of them shits
around her neck.

262
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,642
- Gave the other one to him.
- You know, his and hers, like.

263
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,021
Yeah, Cutty. She was on that shit, man.

264
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:38,116
It's been a week, McNulty. Either you got
something on Stringer or you don't.

265
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,911
He tried to sell me a condo.

266
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,998
Cocksucker.

267
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,544
Might as well join the Rotary
and take up golf or some shit.

268
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:53,715
Running with the hounds,
but I bet his heart's still with the fox.

269
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,134
Stringer's out of the game?

270
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,386
Mr. Bell has become the bank.

271
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,639
The bank?

272
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,518
The bank plays it legit.
He generates honest income.

273
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,479
But at the same time,
his money finances packages

274
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,981
that he himself will never touch.

275
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:14,611
He won't go near the street. He's insulated
from the everyday operations of the corner.

276
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,364
The money that comes back
is then laundered through

277
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,534
enough investments
that there's no way to trace it.

278
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,620
A player gets to that point,
there ain't no way in hell

279
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,581
a working police
is gonna tie a can to his tail.

280
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,666
Oh, man.

281
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,920
So, Kintel Williamson,
the prince of Pimlico.

282
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,591
- Where we at on this mope?
- DNRs on a couple of payphones.

283
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,611
That got it?

284
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,873
About right.

285
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,375
You gonna help or what, boy?

286
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,504
Might as well not even take a whistle
if I'm just standin' in the fuckin' alley.

287
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,549
Back's where you belong.

288
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,719
Thataway I ain't got to worry
about getting my head blown off

289
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,971
'cause you all scared and shit.

290
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,140
Enough!

291
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,685
Y'all hear me? I said enough.

292
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:33,315
Come over here and put some pumpkin balls
in this shotgun, man. Kimmy!

293
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,364
Both of y'all learn to live with it,
or y'all out, man.

294
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,708
Now, this time we gonna do it right.
Y'all feel me?

295
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,836
Boss, you gotta let this go.
It ain't gonna work.

296
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,880
You said in COMSTAT shit rolls down.

297
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,425
We tried to talk to all the hoppers.
What can they do about anything?

298
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,719
We need to bring it to the dealers.

299
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,555
Sergeant.

300
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:11,937
I need a list of names of all
the mid-level dealers running my corners.

301
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,021
Sir?

302
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:16,399
You are my DEU sergeant, right?
I need a list of names.

303
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:21,112
Maybe narcotics downtown
has something like that. I don't know.

304
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:26,868
We're knockin' heads, takin' bodies. I didn't
know I was supposed to be doin' a census.

305
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,460
Hey, yo, miss.
Where the pee-pot at?

306
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,545
Thanks. Come on, this way.

307
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,217
My man need to drop a negative.

308
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:50,600
- $5.
- Motherfucker, they was just two.

309
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,979
You try findin' clean piss in Baltimore.
Five a go.

310
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:00,944
- How I know it's clean?
- I get mine from daycare.

311
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,785
I need you to put the chicken
in the oven at 375.

312
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,871
Yes, and then I need you
to help me put your sister down...

313
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,499
Excuse me, miss.

314
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,043
Put your thumb on the scanner.

315
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,589
Hold on a second.

316
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:27,012
- What's your name?
- Wise, Dennis Wise.

317
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,932
Take one of those.
Go around the corner to the second door.

318
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,936
No, you cannot go outside.
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

319
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,836
That's all we got on the West Side dealers.

320
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,057
George. I'm lookin'
at a sprinklin' of rap sheets here.

321
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,518
You tellin' me nobody know
who controls West Baltimore corners?

322
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:18,730
Rawls has my people doin' street rips.

323
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,107
You want info, try the intelligence unit.

324
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:24,611
- Shit, they sent me to you, George.
- What the fuck can I tell you?

325
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:28,573
With all the street work, ain't nobody left
doin' high-end drug stuff.

326
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,747
From what I'm hearing,
the guy comes in of his own accord

327
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,750
and he gets betrayed by us.

328
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,378
Protection in this city amounts
to nothing more than getting dumped

329
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,381
in a fleabag joint on Route 40
and calling it a plan.

330
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,759
No monitoring, no assistance.

331
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,096
Nothing. Just a bundle of clothes
and a toothbrush.

332
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,432
- Jesus.
- No way to treat a cooperator.

333
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,810
I could get a lot out of this
with the press.

334
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:01,773
But fuck that, because that way everybody
gets defensive and nothing gets fixed.

335
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,485
- I'm coming to you with this, straight up.
- Agreed.

336
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,903
Where do we stand on this?

337
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,156
You've already called a meeting on it
with the state's attorney

338
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:14,119
and the Police Commissioner.
It's penciled in for next Wednesday.

339
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,455
No, Tommy's right on this.
We need to act quickly.

340
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,417
I'm glad you came to us with this.
I'll light a fire, believe me.

341
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,212
All right, thanks.

342
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:31,386
- Uh, you will keep me in the loop on this?
- Absolutely. Councilman.

343
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,571
- Slow up, we need to talk.
- Yeah, sweet thing.

344
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,574
- We met before?
- No, baby, but that can happen.

345
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,117
We ain't met, excuse me.

346
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,995
- It's just talk, baby.
- Get the fuck out the way.

347
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,997
Look, girl, all we need you to do is talk.

348
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,749
- Is you deaf or just stupid?
- Hold on, girl...

349
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,919
Damn.

350
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,798
Now we gonna talk.

351
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,433
How the fuck is this little runt of a unit

352
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,102
holdin' all this drug intelligence?

353
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:25,315
At headquarters I came up with jack,
and y'all holdin' all this.

354
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,943
You run a couple of wiretaps,
you fill up a file cabinet pretty fast.

355
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,738
This is great. Thanks.

356
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,702
Oh, shit! God damn it!

357
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,540
I heard this was where you landed.

358
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,502
This pretty boy, I broke his ass in.

359
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,797
I wrote more on ID complaints
on bushy top here

360
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,676
than on the whole goddamn squad.
That's till he scuffed himself up.

361
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:57,764
- Now where you at, McNulty?
- 1911 South Clinton Street, first floor.

362
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,350
There you go.

363
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,980
Yeah. I know you gotta keep him close

364
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,984
but still, that's a good goddamn police
right here.

365
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,321
So what brings you to our shop?

366
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,366
I'm tryin' to find out
who running my corners.

367
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:21,955
My own DEU is just about street rips,
and headquarters wasn't no help, neither.

368
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,292
- Y'all saved my ass, though.
- You tell him about your boy, Marlo?

369
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:30,505
It's in the files, along with
every other mid-level player we know.

370
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,884
You don't mind me askin',
what are you gonna do with all that, Major?

371
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,719
Well...

372
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,014
we'll round up these young men...

373
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,934
and put a little COMSTAT on their ass.

374
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,939
Gentlemen. Ma'am. Bushy top.

375
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,736
Bushy top?

376
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,453
Uh, point of order and shit.

377
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,790
Chair recognize the esteemed rep
of the Veronica Avenue boys.

378
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,294
All right, look, we done talked this shit
to death, all right?

379
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,839
- When we gonna vote?
- Rick do have a point.

380
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,800
All right, then.
All those in favor of goin' together

381
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:20,471
so we can get the best discount
on a New York package, raise up.

382
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,444
- All right, then.
- There it is.

383
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,072
Look like we gonna make
more money, together.

384
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,242
I'm proud of y'all
for putting aside petty grievances

385
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,411
and puttin' this thing together.

386
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,874
For a cold-ass crew of gangsters,
y'all carried it like Republicans and shit.

387
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,085
Remember, man,
talk this shit up when you hit them bricks.

388
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:55,965
Best way to get more involved is to tell people
about the benefits of this here thing.

389
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,718
No beefing, no drama, just business.

390
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,596
Anybody got problems
with anybody else here,

391
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,972
we bring it to the group.

392
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,600
We ain't gotta take it to the streets.

393
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,896
All right. Let's do it.

394
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,651
Yo.

395
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:18,863
Motherfucker, what is that?

396
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:23,368
The Robert Rules say we gotta have
minutes for a meeting. These the minutes.

397
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:27,372
Nigger, is you takin' notes
on a criminal fuckin' conspiracy?

398
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,707
What the fuck is you thinking, man?

399
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,050
- That's cool.
- Dad, he's cheating.

400
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,928
Michael, take it easy on your brother.

401
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,724
How are you two getting along
with Mom's new friend?

402
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,978
- We call him Dennis. He's not new.
- OK, how are you doin' with him?

403
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,773
Mom says we can't talk to you
about family stuff.

404
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,942
Dad, you going to the open house?

405
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,738
Yeah, I'll try.
I've been real busy at work, though.

406
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:04,867
- New case and all.
- Mom says you have to go, Dad.

407
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,703
All the other kids' fathers are gonna be there.

408
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,922
Get his legs.

409
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,632
Aagh!

410
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,562
Argh!

411
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:39,026
- Steal from us, motherfucker?
- Get the ring too, yo.

412
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,157
- Shit won't come off, yo.
- Drop him.

413
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,745
Arrrghh!

414
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,748
You know the man works for us.

415
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,877
You keep goin' like that,
ain't gonna be nothin' left of him

416
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,962
to make right what he owes.

417
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,399
Bitch got to pay.

418
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,360
- Check his pockets, yo.
- Right.

419
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,868
- That's mine, yo.
- Fuck off! Get the fuck off!

420
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,499
This is command to security.

421
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,417
What's up, baby?

422
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,011
Man, I been here for 26 months,

423
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,097
you come pick me up
in a motherfuckin' Ford?

424
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,853
I'm just fucking with you. What's up, baby?

425
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,688
What up, man?

426
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,399
I'm feeling good to be
out of this motherfucker.

427
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:04,403
There's a sign on the other side of this gate
that say, "Never again."

428
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:07,698
That's the only fucking thing
I'm gonna take with me from here.

429
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:11,911
- First things first. Let's get you lookin' right.
- You got my shit.

430
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,081
Yes. Yes. Good-looking, baby.

431
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,637
Start with Sector One.

432
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,349
Bring as many as you can down to
Vincent Street by the end of the shift.

433
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,101
Don't use your wagons.

434
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,937
Bring as many as you can in your cars.

435
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,857
The hoppers wouldn't listen.
What makes you think these guys will?

436
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:46,404
These are lieutenants running the corners

437
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,698
and I personally feel their pain.

438
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,078
Now, middle-management means
that you have just enough responsibility

439
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,706
that you got to listen when people talk

440
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:01,961
and not so much that you can tell anybody
to go fuck themselves.

441
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,176
471, 471...

442
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,486
Get in.

443
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:32,908
Look, my major just wants to talk.
That's all, I promise.

444
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:36,704
- We'll bring you right back.
- Ain't gonna happen.

445
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,750
What the fuck you say?

446
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,919
What the fuck you mean,
it ain't gonna happen?

447
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,548
Let me tell you something, motherfucker.
We got orders to bring you

448
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,216
for a sit-down with our boss.

449
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,260
We're prepared to take you with us now.

450
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,805
- We can either do this the easy way...
- Brain-dead fucks.

451
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,974
It's up to you.

452
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,101
- Hello.
- Prez, it's me.

453
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:03,439
I think we got a little situation here.
Stay with me. 10-6.

454
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,150
Major wants the dickhead, you gotta go.

455
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,154
I think he gets a pass this time.

456
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,532
You sure? I mean, you want, he goes.

457
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,576
Another time, Herc.

458
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,537
We're on the major's clock here.

459
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:26,545
Don't forget the face, cocksucker.
It's gonna be here tomorrow.

460
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:35,888
- You need me to call dispatch?
- No, it's OK. I'll tell you later.

461
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,600
I say we get the troops
and fuck these assholes up.

462
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:59,537
- Come on, let's go again.
- Come on, Tommy, it's just a game.

463
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:04,041
Look, sounds like you got what you want,
anyway. From the mayor, I mean.

464
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,128
Yeah, well, he's played me before.

465
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:11,048
But so help me, if he farts around on this,

466
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,884
I'm goin' after him, big time.

467
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,011
- For real?
- Trust me on this.

468
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:21,016
He keeps ducking me,
I'm gonna fuck him good.

469
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,813
That's the good part.

470
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,857
It's what I call the carrot.

471
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:31,402
Now, you move your people
into any designated area I told you about,

472
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,321
and you'll have immunity
from arrest and prosecution.

473
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,533
You're free to make your drops, collect,

474
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:41,162
won't nobody bother you.
You got my word on it.

475
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:46,333
- What do you get outta this?
- That's a fair question.

476
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,420
I want to salvage
what's worth salvaging in my district.

477
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:53,632
I can't do that with a bunch of hoppers
scaring the hell out of decent people.

478
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:57,261
Now, these kids ain't gonna listen to me,
but they will listen to y'all.

479
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,306
You tell them to move down here
and they will.

480
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,769
So the way I got it figured, I motivate you...

481
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,604
and you motivate them.

482
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,439
Nah, this is a trap.

483
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,608
No, you check out the spot.

484
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:14,361
There ain't no cameras,
ain't no microphones, nothing.

485
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,323
Any cops you see
going to be down right on the perimeter.

486
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:21,911
Just to make sure there's no violence.
And you watch.

487
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,497
You see if it don't work out the way I say.

488
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:30,544
Nothing personal against you, Chief,
but what happens if we buck?

489
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,672
You remember the carrot, right?

490
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,802
Well, you choose the stick instead...

491
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:41,639
you gonna feel that stick
like you ain't never felt before.

492
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:44,809
We gonna indict every corner, every day.

493
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,062
I got over 200 sworn personnel
and I plan to free up every one

494
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,398
to knock every one of y'all down they can.

495
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:55,236
You on a corner in my district,
it ain't gonna be about no humble,

496
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,948
it ain't gonna be about no loitering charge,
nothing like that.

497
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,241
There gonna be some biblical shit

498
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,494
happening to you
on the way to that jail wagon.

499
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,997
And while you buckin' the new system,
the smart ones among you

500
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:11,460
gonna be down here,
makin' money hand over fist.

501
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,506
So think it over.

502
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,424
But I swear to God, come Monday,

503
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,594
your world and mine
ain't gonna be the same.

504
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,940
I thought you said
these goddamn houses were vacant.

505
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,025
We must have missed her.

506
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,444
That's one more thing I gotta do, then.

507
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,382
Little man, up on B tier,
one of his boys in the dormitory,

508
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:02,595
his brother's tight with the girlfriend
of the boy that shot that police.

509
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:06,682
Little man saying,
"If you sprung the three of us,

510
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,644
"we can get her talking."
You know, find the gun.

511
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,815
Yo, I'm hearing the boy Dink
got that man's gun.

512
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,319
Now, I ain't sure yet
if that Dink be Dink Dink

513
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,905
or Inky Dink or maybe Fat Dink.

514
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,700
Then again, it might be Flatnose Dink.
No, wait.

515
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,329
Nah, that can't be him, that Dink dead.

516
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,748
Look, man, I can help you,

517
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,500
but first you gotta get me
out of these murder beefs.

518
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,086
How many murders are we talking?

519
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:43,427
Look, man, do it have to be the cop's gun?

520
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,388
Cos if it's guns you want,
I can get you guns.

521
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,360
I remember this. Sixth grade.

522
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:04,448
Miss Holley's science class.
Box lunches. Taste like shit.

523
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,868
You got something so important
you can't use the proper channels?

524
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,996
Well, no. I don't know.

525
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:16,669
I just figured if I told anybody but you,
you might think I'm riding the rock.

526
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,213
What makes me think you ain't?

527
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,090
Yeah, right. That's a good point.

528
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:25,594
Look, today, me, Tuckie, Little Mikey,

529
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,847
man, we all, a bunch of us
got scooped up by the police.

530
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,768
Well, you shouldn't sell drugs.

531
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:44,655
- All right, all right.
- See, they didn't take us to the station.

532
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,782
They took us down to Vincent Street

533
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,910
where all the houses is boarded up,
and they let us out.

534
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,662
And then, on top of all of that,

535
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:55,457
the whole while they was being
all like decent and shit,

536
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,543
and you know that fucked me up.

537
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,630
And then, like,
the police chief, he come out -

538
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,507
and this is the crazy part -

539
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:08,679
he say that he got it set up
so where we could sell stuff in certain spots

540
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,348
and the police won't bother us.

541
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:14,184
I know, I know. It's fucked up.

542
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,854
But I just thought you should know.

543
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:24,945
- That's it?
- Yeah, just that and the boy Marlo.

544
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,032
Yeah, I'm on it.

545
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,869
Yep.

546
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:48,719
Speaking to officer at
5-Baker-25 on the northern channel.

547
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,765
23-03 to KGA.

548
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,394
Have Foxtrot meet me on six, Adam.

549
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,440
- Foxtrot, 10-4.
- 23-03 to Foxtrot.

550
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,027
- Foxtrot, standing by.
- It's a black Mercedes, pulling out the lot.

551
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,613
Copy that, we got the eyeball.

552
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:28,383
This here the spot? Cos Tuckie says
we supposed to set up shop here.

553
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:29,510
Huh?

554
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,721
- Hamsterdam.
- Yeah, this is it.

555
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,849
Set up anywhere inside
where we got the white flags.

556
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,609
- I'm ready to roll out.
- You just got here. What's wrong?

557
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,528
Ain't nobody around to buy.

558
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,698
Good point.

559
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,953
- Man needs customers.
- I'm sayin'...

560
00:40:56,037 --> 00:41:00,415
No. I mean, you can't make me.
I'm a sworn fuckin' police officer.

561
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,519
What's up, man?
You got that Body Bag still? Two.

562
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,565
Narco.

563
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,489
Give it up, motherfucker.
Money comes back, right now.

564
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,829
You fuckin' up. You didn't let me cop
before you snatch me up.

565
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,914
Is that some fuckin' rule?

566
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:47,546
- You call, we haul. You clean?
- Yeah, of course I'm clean.

567
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,048
Stupid-ass rookie
didn't give me a chance to cop.

568
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,508
This corner's indicted.

569
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:55,596
You move over to Vincent Street,
or we come back with the bracelets.

570
00:41:56,598 --> 00:42:00,225
Anybody available
for complaint at...

571
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,958
- What you got?
- 10-11 me at Riggs and Calhoun.

572
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,879
Despite unforeseen delays,

573
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:32,132
we will begin an academy class
this January,

574
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,636
which leaves us in good shape
for the coming year.

575
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,804
Thank you, Commissioner.

576
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,141
The chair pleases,
I have a couple of questions.

577
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,603
Commissioner, you are aware
that a state witness

578
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,023
in a recent city homicide prosecution
was killed.

579
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,111
Uh, we are treating that incident
with the highest priority.

580
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,197
Homicide has set up a task force

581
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,075
and Narcotics is working
the informant angle.

582
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:01,787
We have also asked both the FBI
and DEA for support.

583
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:05,165
It sounds like a full-court press,
but you must admit

584
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,460
it's a bit like closing the barn door
after the horse is out.

585
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,879
The shooting of the boy
at Lake Clifton School

586
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:14,549
was a high-profile case,
wasn't it, Commissioner?

587
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,176
Yes, it was.

588
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:21,556
And yet a key witness in the case
was allowed... One moment.

589
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:29,856
Excuse me, but the chair reminds me
that you have a pressing engagement.

590
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,235
So if it's all right with you,
we can continue this at a later date.

591
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,320
Meeting adjourned.

592
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,077
Did you see Burrell sweat?

593
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,455
- The man's collar almost melted.
- What the hell got into you?

594
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,333
You did, old buddy. You did.

595
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,802
10-8, 23.

596
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:07,102
End of the line, all out.

597
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:13,483
We got that Rockefeller, yo.
We got that Rockefeller over here, yo.

598
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,570
- Over here we got that Rockefeller.
- What the fuck?

599
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,159
Yo, yo, we got that Rockefeller, yo.

600
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,911
We got that WMD. Right here, right here.

601
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,832
- I hear the WMD is the bomb.
- WMD. Right here.

602
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,049
WMD.

603
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,595
Give me two, yo.

604
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,389
WMD. Right here.

605
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,934
WMD, right here. Right here.

606
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,439
Right here.

607
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,734
We got that Rockefeller over here.

608
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,154
We got that Rockefeller, yo.

609
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,204
- What do we got?
- There's binoculars on the floor.

610
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:17,422
- Marlo makin' a move?
- Just watch.

611
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,509
Forget everything the boy Bodie told you.

612
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:23,678
Forget the beating, it ain't about that.

613
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,475
You smart, man, I can see that.

614
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,854
I wanted you to choose somewhere safe
for us to speak, but God damn...

615
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,775
only bugs in this motherfucker
gonna have legs.

616
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,445
Now, I appreciate smart,

617
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,865
but you gotta know in this game, man,
it ain't enough.

618
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,450
You a student of history?

619
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,121
You know this town had its share
of smart players, man?

620
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:55,001
Melvin, Little Wil, Big Head Brother,
Peanut, Warren.

621
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:58,630
All real smart, man, real smart.

622
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,341
But you know,
soon as their names rang out...

623
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:05,429
bam, the feds was on them.
You know what I mean?

624
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:08,014
Government ain't want you to be organized.

625
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,058
They want you scrimpin' and scrapin'

626
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:14,438
and killin' each other on the corner
on some bullshit. Not me.

627
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:18,024
That's why me and Prop Joe,
we getting ready to put this co-op together.

628
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,695
Different crews, one package.
Best dope, best coke.

629
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,697
Share and share alike.

630
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,825
- Been hearin' about that.
- You been hearin' about that?

631
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,536
That's good. That's a start, right?

632
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,456
You know that Mercedes
you got ridin' out there,

633
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,625
you got that titled in your aunt's name
or some shit?

634
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,464
Now, when they come get you,
that straw purchase out there

635
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:45,343
gonna come bite you in the ass, boy.
That's what they do.

636
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,679
They turn your money against you.

637
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:51,016
Now, you,
I'm thinkin' with the corners that you got...

638
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,437
- you close to a mil, right?
- I'm doin' all right.

639
00:46:55,521 --> 00:47:00,025
You doin' all right, but all right
ain't got your name on a crib, right?

640
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,987
Ain't got you a little spot for you
to wash that dirty money.

641
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,699
That's what I'm offering you, man.

642
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:16,082
- Come on, who's he in there with?
- I told you, keep watching.

643
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,503
Bunk put you up to this?

644
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,506
Tell you what, how about a case
of that PBR piss you drink

645
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,549
against a touch of the Irish

646
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:28,261
that he went out the back
and you're watching that house for nothing?

647
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,347
Here comes your nothing.

648
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,477
Whoa!

649
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,854
Oh, ho ho ho ho!

650
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,940
I like my piss in bottles.

651
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,984
Any way you like, darlin'.

652
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,451
Chris. Tell our people to tool up.

653
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,747
I'm on it.

654
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,841
WMD. Got that WMD.

655
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,557
They get
comfortable pretty quick.

656
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:16,226
It's like we ain't even
standin' here.

657
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,687
The hoppers call it Hamsterdam.

658
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,481
Like from Amsterdam.

659
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,734
Hamsterdam.

660
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,740
The use of
integrated match concepts,

661
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:34,869
such as algebraic reasoning and
number sense, geometry and probability.

662
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,204
Very impressive.

663
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:39,624
Now what we try to do is keep
the class size under ten, 12 at the most.

664
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:42,085
- And there are three levels?
- Yes, so that...

665
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:45,880
Sorry, I'm Jim McNulty.
I'm a little late, developments at work.

666
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,424
Mr. McNulty.

667
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,760
I have some concerns
about the integrated math program.

668
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:54,097
In their previous schools,
Michael took introductory algebra

669
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:56,558
but I hear you're doing
something different.

670
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,352
- We are. The integrated program...
- I'm thirsty.

671
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,480
Can I get either of you something to drink?

672
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,774
The integrated math program consists...

673
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,994
Not much of a spread
but you can't go wrong with crudités.

674
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,537
Crudity?

675
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,459
I'm sorry. I came straight from work,
or I'd have changed.

676
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,378
No need to call names, right?

677
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:29,341
- What do you do, Mr...
- I'm on the board at Legg Mason.

678
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:30,967
Jim McNulty.

679
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:32,969
Legg Mason?

680
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:36,640
Either that or I'm a cop in the city.
I keep forgetting.

681
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,894
Terri D'Agostino.

682
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,481
I'm an alumni and one of the school's
dreaded fundraisers.

683
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:49,402
The math program
offers tutoring possibilities.

684
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,571
So if Michael has difficulty adjusting,

685
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,699
we can have classes
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

686
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:58,161
- So how do you find the school?
- It's good.

687
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,371
Good.

688
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:02,082
My ex and I are thinking
of sending our boys here.

689
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,959
- Any problems, difficulties?
- No, not really.

690
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:09,589
I mean, there's the math integration class
for my oldest.

691
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,883
He's in sixth, seventh, and...

692
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,763
I'm just not sure he's ready, you know,
for all that math.

693
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,989
Aagh!

694
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,418
- Careful, I'm only a country boy.
- Shut up.

695
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,228
Hey, sweetie. Welcome home.

696
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:06,771
How you doin'?

697
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:12,527
What's up, man? How you doin'?

698
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,077
Welcome back.

699
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,413
Hey, sis.

700
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:28,168
Man, I just wish I wasn't the only one
coming home, you know.

701
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,713
I know.

702
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,883
Enjoy tonight. We'll talk later.

703
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:39,012
- Welcome home.
- What up, Prop? How you doing, man?

704
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,681
- You lookin' fit.
- Hell, yeah,

705
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,933
I've been working out.
That's all you do.

706
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:47,937
Might be a good place
for a fat man to find his inner self.

707
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:19,844
Yo. I got some downtown suits
who wanna holler at you real quick.

708
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:24,599
Ah, shit. Takin' me to see suits?
I'm tryin' to see some skirts.

709
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,279
So what do you do?

710
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,907
You should get dressed.

711
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:48,456
I got a lot of work here.
It's a long day for me tomorrow.

712
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,585
I'll be really quiet.

713
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,800
You never know,
you might get bored workin'.

714
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,135
I gotta work.

715
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,598
You gotta go.

716
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,526
What Stringer has done
with all that property downtown, Avon,

717
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,820
I cannot tell the profit you're looking at

718
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,406
once the federal redevelopment
money lands.

719
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,741
That whole Howard Street thing
will take off

720
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,994
and you'll be right there to cut the pie.

721
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:29,539
Any dollar you spend now
is gonna come back to you ten times.

722
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:33,418
And the thing is, I know
you don't wanna go back to them streets.

723
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,128
Not after what you been through.

724
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,172
I know, 'cause I'm from them same streets.

725
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,925
And once I had the chance
to play a different game

726
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,011
it wasn't a question in my mind how to go.

727
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:45,138
Government's will look at you hard too.

728
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,640
No sense giving 'em
what they're looking for.

729
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,893
You take what you have, you build on it.

730
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:53,855
It's all good. Just put it up on the calendar.
We should meet.

731
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,237
Yo, Slim.
You see them two niggers right there?

732
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:04,741
They over there getting high
in the middle of all this.

733
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,535
Now where the fucking discipline at, yo?

734
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,038
Fuck, toss them niggers.

735
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,938
Can I talk to you for a second?
Don't you know not to stare at me like that?

736
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,731
Yo.

737
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,943
I gotta show you something.
Pardon me, sweetie.

738
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,862
Yo, man.
You know I've been locked down, man.

739
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,698
You gonna love this. Trust me.

740
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,497
Oh, OK.

741
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:58,628
Uhh-huh. Yeah.

742
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:01,214
Uh-huh.

743
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:06,386
Shit, this ain't my little place
down in Jessup.

744
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,137
But what the fuck is, right?

745
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:12,934
This is all you, B.
All you, in your name too.

746
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:17,230
You know what I mean?
This piece of paper right here make it legit.

747
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,441
Keys to the Navigator in the basement.

748
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:23,152
It's just a rental
until you pick out something nice.

749
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,863
Damn, all this, huh?

750
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,740
You did good.

751
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,993
We makin' so much straight money, man,

752
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:34,580
we can carry shit like this out in the open,
in our own names.

753
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:39,043
Yo, you remember when we used to sit
on the top of 734 building, man,

754
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:42,005
lookin' at the city,
used to talk about what we gonna do?

755
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:45,008
And you was all heavy
into that black pride bullshit

756
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,970
talking like you gonna get two grocery stores,
make motherfuckers proud.

757
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:53,474
Sure was, man,
you was out hunting on a AK-47

758
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:56,936
talking about "I'm gonna go get warrin'."

759
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,772
Man.

760
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,070
- We brothers, B.
- Always, baby.

761
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:08,865
Always.

762
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,661
Just one more thing, though, man.

763
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:15,872
I don't mean to be picking with you,

764
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,624
especially not after you did
all this shit for me,

765
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,878
but, look, man, I've been locked down.
You know what I mean?

766
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,922
You know what?
I gotta take this meet.

767
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,884
I'm gonna get at you. Welcome home, man.

768
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:41,481
Hey, yo, it's me, man. I left something.

769
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,829
Shit. My man.
