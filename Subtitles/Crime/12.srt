1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is just an automatic translation 
of the Hungarian Subs...

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:08,001
... thats why it also still has so 
many Hungarian words in it
since I do not speak Hungarian.

3
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:12,002
Maybe someone with some time
 and a dictionary can correct the rest?

4
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:16,002
But better than nothing, so thank Zeph for the Hungarian Subs.
Have fun. - André

5
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:05,236
TIZENKETTÕ

6
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:19,972
Juror lords

00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,647
...az delegated away bûncselekmény for his weight

...a opposite a defendant charges

10
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:36,035
Juror lords, Ön may have caught it the
bûncselekmény his weight

11
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:43,119
If they agree with the point of view of the charge,
the decision has to be taken:
bûnös, or not

12
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:53,078
The Russian folk made a lot because of that, that
let him unite it on this wide area

13
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:58,163
...amennyiben solid doubt

00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:02,117
...a büntetõ statute book relevant

You have to decide it the defendant

...hogy for leaning them against monotone one

18
00:03:32,642 --> 00:03:33,401
I repeat it once more

19
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:35,846
for monotone one.

20
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:43,843
The highest punishment which can be imposed

21
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:53,684
...az opposite a convict applicable
highest punishment the relevant
in the sense of measures

22
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:59,167
...hogy for their decision anyway

00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:01,921
...ennek the man's fate

24
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:04,240

00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:09,184
...minden, the substance which is connected to the case

26
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:11,123
In case of their claim promptly

27
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:13,000
...amennyiben arises

28
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:59,639
Mom! Mother, speak in Russian! Mom!

29
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,277
Speak in Russian.

30
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:06,757
Speak in Russian, mother.

31
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,761
Speak in Russian, mother.

32
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:21,107
Mom!

33
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:26,160
Until the making of the jurors' decision
I order a pause.

34
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,203
I am asking it, let them be set up!

35
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,067
Being audible

36
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:40,307
Father, you are hungry?

37
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,437
Egyelõre is everything properly. Yes.

38
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:48,607
Says it I am asking it, the photographs, that the judge
showed, I may take it in?

39
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:49,686
I donot know.

40
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,572
- Do I have to stay here?
- Yes.

41
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:55,202
- But back I told everything already.
- Then, this order.

42
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:59,167
- With a word, juror lords
- This is a phantasm.

43
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,446
...kérem, let them delegate now.

44
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,836
Let them be struggling along, I am asking it, we have to get there the
until a twenty minutes break.

45
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:06,964
- Until a what kind of pause?
- Everything is found out immediately.

46
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,322
Let them not fall behind. After me, after me.

47
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,067
Here, I am asking it!

48
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:17,925
Let's go.

49
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,692
It is seen, the renovation yet not
fejezõdött in.

50
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:24,007
That room was not able to be finished yet,
where they should hold a meeting. Here, here!

51
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:24,846
After me.

52
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,685
The renovation, naturally good thing, but
he makes the work difficult.

53
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,523
This does not affect themselves, clear the case,
egyszerû their thing.

54
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:33,052
They decide under cca. 20 minutes, this here
actually an egyszerû thing.

55
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:36,247
Here more carefully, we go over now an
into an adjacent room.

56
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:37,852
A school put it at our disposal.

57
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:41,767
Court beside the school, rather much
he entails a problem.

58
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,972
Imagine only away:
Spring, is, the windows open,

59
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:48,444
a ball is flying in, directly the witness
into his forehead and ready - loses his consciousness.
An idõs nõ.

60
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:53,607
Not, the holiday was good on his time, splendid,
dared in the classes

61
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:57,627
Children! Children!

62
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:01,327
My god is sweet! Children! Children!
Children! Children!

63
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,726
Children, I beg for it!

64
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:05,958
Let us withdraw here onto a side, a side.
Let everybody come here.

65
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:12,247
It is seen, between what kind of circumstances is needed
to work?

66
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:14,172
This only temporary, does not last until a lot.

67
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:16,727
If the renovation is finished, the court
egyszerûen will be magnificent.

68
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:18,319
Be going already. Faster!

69
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:25,967
Indulgence, this only egyszerû formality, but
all of the mobile telephones have to be passed.

70
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:27,246
This is in this manner unfortunately.

71
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,247
I withdraw it SIM card, a lot important
there is information on him.

72
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,207
- Being audible, Vaszja
- Persze-persze, onto the god's love.

73
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:33,726
...másfél onto a clock turn off.

74
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:38,567
Tell it Margarita Jakovlenának, that
I am on social work. Õ wanted this.
That is it.

75
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:43,247
I will be here throughout. If he would be need onto me,
from an any kind of reason,

76
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:46,319
this apparatus is here, with this may indicate.

77
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:51,400
This it I Know-How-m.
With a word, my invention.

78
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:56,683
From my son is, from the child railroad.

79
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,332
- It is not known, that mûködik?
- No.

80
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,887
Let everybody be listening
This button is pressed.

81
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,052
This will be at themselves.

82
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:11,067
If the smallest need is onto me, immediately
call in,

83
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:15,047
I will be here promptly, and I bring anything,
what they need only.

84
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,925
They will hold a meeting here. All conditions
given Kérem Ön.

85
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:22,507
Please.

86
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,467
Hands!

87
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:42,083
We this, we will hold a meeting in a gym?

88
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,978
I said it already, a renovation is going on there.

89
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:55,207
Somebody does not know it, how much idõ may be
to get out onto Kurszki állomásra?

90
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:56,742
So idõben.

91
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:01,567
At least one and a half clocks, but rather
an forty.

92
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,102
Go!

93
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:06,787
Let us come, throw it here!

94
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,732
- Are you sure?
- Get rid of it only, get rid of it!

95
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,607
- Since this
- Szpartak - the champion!
- Na, catch it!

96
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:21,052
- What was that?
- Himself was asking it.

97
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:25,084
This not too football ball, but
medicine-ball, it is not possible to play with this.

98
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:29,612
Does he talk about the lamp?

99
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:32,986
Anyway at us in the school
just like this is.

100
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:36,325
- You see that?
- Totally.
- Does not know it, where WC is here?

101
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:49,723
What there is now, in will be here closed?

102
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:54,005
These rules.
He is needed in this manner!

103
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:05,212
Look at it, already!

104
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:06,919
This why it was made with him?

105
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:11,521
- Sure, that let the children not ruin it.
- You are translated.

106
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,238
You are translated, in case the children
let them be wounded because of it.

107
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:17,762
He may drop behind.

108
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:23,126
Somehow not really lucky, that
there is a court beside the school.

109
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:26,766
He does not drop behind.

110
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:30,207
There is even a upright piano behind the grid,
and on the bench.

111
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,742
WC is here.

112
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,366
That is good.

113
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:45,680
Why it is abstained from, does not buy something?
Visibly mindannyiunknak set.

114
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,412
For us? Not shop,?

115
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,127
- Have bought! There is tea here with lemon.
- Thank you.

116
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:50,719
Thank you very much.

117
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:56,316
My business lunch will be today in Puskin.
Egyszerûen do not want elõre to be replete.

118
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,804
Next this does not last until so much,?

119
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,641
I do not believe it, this not that case.

120
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:08,347
I believe it in that manner.

121
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:13,205
It is a totally other case.

122
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:19,406
Mmm a curio. What gyönyörûség.

123
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:26,167
Dugi was on place. Let him imagine it,
I forgot it, was not idõm to change.

124
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:27,702
Annoying.

125
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:38,796
Principle collection pfuj!
My lords, let us set about it!

126
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:47,047
Let them be listening, elvtársak-pfuj-urak,

127
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,765
Very little it idõnk.

128
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,052
- Does he hurry so much possibly?
- Not expressing.

129
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,967
My train leaves after a clock Nyizsnij-in,
next guest performance on Volga River.

130
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:58,492
He attains it certainly.
There is at most an a hour's work here.

131
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:02,247
- That toilet?
- Not, this here the boy WC, it there the
VIP.

132
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:06,718
Somebody can say a rhyme Júlia onto a word?

133
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,279
Júlia - fury.

134
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:14,517
But not, what kind of fury.
Júlia is a beautiful young girl.

135
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:17,680
Júlia? Tessék:

136
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:27,604
Pulja, sells it,

00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:31,045

- His school?

139
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,965
His school, his party, his mom, dad

140
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,347
Oh, my God!

141
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,117

- The televí where the TV is?
- There he is.

143
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:56,443
An interview will be today with my mum!

144
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,421
Who is his own mum? Politician? Színésznõ?

145

Not mûködik! Mum.

We have a family TV company, LTV his name.
Were they not audible from him?

149
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:25,845
My mum I am the president, me the
general manager, I help him.

150
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,125
With a word, a producer.

Na, caught this.

152
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:40,167
- Nahát, saw this?
- I apologise!

153
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:41,732
One like this was seen already?!

And yet only pupil!
- Aj-jaj-jaj.

155
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,245
The food is good sure.

156
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:50,567
I saw one like this only one times in my life.

157
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:51,726
Pupil at a girl?

158
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,967
Come on. Where thinks!

159
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:56,207
It is for my mother-in-law similar.

Was.

161
00:13:57,407 --> 00:14:01,247
Not, 3 of his months I buried it.

162
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:02,885
This is a yes!

163
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:10,047
Little boys and little girls

164
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,964
- Let it be looked at, what I found!
- The reason stops!

165
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:17,846
Blow the song some people,
browse others.

166
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:20,847
Akceleráció!

167
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,087
Excuse me.

168
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:37,725
Sorry.

169
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:40,627
Sorry.

170
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:46,927
I lost it because of this monstrosity
my elder brother.

171
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:52,283
On 36 year ones!

172
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:57,443
So much szörnyûséget I saw it already.

173
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,677
Back, because of this.

174
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:04,800
Sorry.
Sorry.

175
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:22,527
Juror lords, let us make something already, that
let the ice be broken finally.

176
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:25,372
Let somebody guide it already down the parade!

177
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,204
- There are a yes, truth, let us begin it.
- Let us come, we start it already.

178
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:34,247
We have to assign it anyway, really an
levezetõ president.

179
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:35,782
THE zsûrinkben.

180
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:41,040
Everything comparing, himself experienced
looks like a man, let him be himself the vezetõnk.

181
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:46,852
- Telephone?
- Á, it gets it with the boiler room only together.
I asked already.

182
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:50,767
- If there is nobody against it, then
- No, No, No.
- ...én with pleasure.

183
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:53,087
It is known, that
We do not stain errõl to vote,?

184
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:54,126
- No, No.
- No.

185
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:59,247
With a word, it is known, that for our decision
has to be definitive will be definitive.

186
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:01,092
And an appeal will not be eligible.

187
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:09,732
And because of this I ask for attention!
Because of this kötelezõen is needed monotonously
to vote.

188
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:14,127
This all clear, we bring it only already
finally operatively our monotone decision.

189
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,812
We may be going next.

190
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:17,612
- Guest performance on Volga River.
- Everybody

191
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:21,252
Everybody may relate his opinion in a row,
next vote.

192
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:24,847
- No, No. Vote
- Afterwards? I
- Vote now immediately.

193
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:26,166
...véleményt to say.

194
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:29,927
- That is nobody protests?
- No, No.
- Not, we start it.

195
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:33,687
With a word to vote, generally,
may be with a show of hands,

196
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,784
or onto sheets of paper

197
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,847
- But not.
- We do it in this manner.
- Let him be a show of hands.

198
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:39,812
- Good.
- Vote.

199
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:44,247
- That is, this means it, with a hand vote?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes, with a hand naturally.

200
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:47,398
I am asking it let him put up his hand, who beside it.

201
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:51,287
There is one single question, the beside it
beside what it is.

202
00:16:51,322 --> 00:16:52,286
Meaning?

203
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:55,607
The reports it beside it, that bûnös,
or it, that innocent.

204
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:57,126
Naturally it, that bûnös.

205
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,800
I I believed it, the beside it
he is besides us starting the vote.

206
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,047
We will vote for it now, that already
vote.

207
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:04,846
I this egyszerûen I do not understand it.

208
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:06,347
- Already vote.
- I donot understand. I donot understand.

209
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:07,726
In that direction, that bûnös.

210
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,292
- I donot understand.
- I this

211
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:14,407
Let their hand be put down, this my mistake.
This vote invalid, this my mistake.

212
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,064
My mistake, I apologise.

213
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,652
So let their hand be put down.

214
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:25,447
We vote for it with a word, that the defendant
bûnös.

215
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:26,286
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.

216
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:28,212
The elevated hand means it bûnös?

217
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:32,327
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Not, I wanted to correct it only, that
let us not make a mistake.

218
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:34,172
Lift it up then your hand and you do not make a mistake.

219
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,007
The underground at themselves, were altogether
gyûlések?

220
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,542
Of course! Steadily!

221
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:42,877
- Na, let us come, vote already!
- Come on!

222
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,887
Why vote elõször in that direction, that bûnös?

223
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:46,726
What is the difference?

224
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:48,399
- Not, but
- What is the difference?

225
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:51,467
That not likes.

226
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,812
It may be this disturbs himself?

227
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:57,367
Not, totally all the same. I believed it only,
is in this direction some kind of rule.

228
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:59,184
Not, there is an any kind of rule here.

229
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:00,853
May be in this manner, reversely.

230
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:02,662
Is not needed reversely, let us come already.

231
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,436
Only vote already egyszerûen.

232
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:09,687
Let us vote for it let it be finished! Vote
in that direction, that the defendant bûnös.

233
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,222
- Yes.
- I am asking it to put the hands up.

234
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:13,167
Monotone! This much, I am going.

235
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:14,932
Not, not, let him stop!

236
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,527
But my lords, I am asking it, there are rules because of that.

237
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:18,326
A kindergarten is clear.

238
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:20,647
Let him sit down, I am asking it.
Let them lower their hand.

239
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,172
Let it be made already down finally their hand

240
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:27,807
And now, who votes for it, that the defendant
Let us observe the rules.

241
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:30,007
...ártatlan.
I am asking it let their hand be raised.

242
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,542
Donot

243
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:38,647
So, 11 May I?
Eleven in that direction, that "bûnös",

244
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,412
and an in that direction, that not bûnös".

245
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:44,998
- This is a yes!
- Then we now mirõl voted?

246
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:49,652
Oh! Let it be looked at now

247
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:52,212
This man was confused totally.

248
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:56,286
We voted on it, that this the stinking
Chechen bastard bûnös, the nevelõapja,

249
00:18:56,327 --> 00:19:00,847
against the Russian army's officer
he delegated away in a murder.

250
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:02,532
You donot get it, do you?

251
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:06,247
The comrade did not understand it. We have to vote it
once more.

252
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:07,839
- Somehow
- Everybody

253
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:09,718
No. Not, not, not, I

254
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,325
No. I corrected it. I am against it.

255
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,885
Against the charge.

256
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,707
We it, that against it?

257
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:35,446
Themselves voted a yes, I though against it.

258
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:37,646
Why?

259
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:44,325
Well developed in that manner, that eleven
Beside it, an though against it.

260
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,085
But why?

261
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,027
How come why?

262
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:52,964
Why voted in this manner?

263
00:19:55,607 --> 00:20:02,687
If I would have voted a yes, then
tizenkettõ would be beside it and
an neither against it.

264
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:04,598
And we could all go home.

265
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,212
But back this good.

266
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,567
Why does he vote against it then?
Let him vote for it and we go home.

267
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:14,559
I De, this somehow too fast.

268
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:18,732
Understand? Express, somehow.

269
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:24,027
Why express? Be listening, until three days
we listened to this woman.
Do you call this an express?

270
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:25,882
No Yeah, but

271
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:31,487
but I got frightened, somehow
We put up our hand somehow, suddenly.

272
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,492
This is too fast somehow. Is it understood?

273
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:36,867
But back it the good, if express.
Everything clear, proven on all of them.

274
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,207
We heard all of the testimonies,
we saw the evidences.

275
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:41,742
Yeah, but

276
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:48,045
But any kind of,
it is only a man after all there.

277
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:53,440
We somehow, hand up and and his end.

278
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:59,843
After all, what wants actually?

279
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:07,747
Want

280
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:18,166
at least to talk about him at least.

281
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:30,679
To talk about him.

282
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:38,867
Let him speak.

283
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:08,367
Sorry. This American jury
his formula:

284
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:12,492
The deficiency of a solid doubt.

285
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:20,400
Egyszerûen I studied at Harvard only
management and I kept silent an short
course from the right.

286
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:26,967
The sense of the talk would be then,
if the deficiency of a doubt would not be solid.

287
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:32,087
Was it heard? A doubt is solid!
We do not have doubts.

288
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:34,292
What kind of doubts?
Destroyed it - this fact.

289
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:39,767
A retired position cruelly
murders his foster son something
because of a ridiculous sum!

290
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:40,886
- Yeah!
- Then mirõl we speak?!

291
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:44,687
Let them be listening, this man on Harvard
completed and there is nothing for him his doubt.

292
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:47,372
He is not for the others.
Himself

293
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,285
- Let him say it already.
- Let them forgive I am asking it, understand.

294
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,283
It had me, of course, Harvard

295
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:56,923
Himself, goes away to buy melon onto the market.

296
00:22:58,247 --> 00:22:59,747
Me?

297
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,412
No, No, No. Me.

298
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,572
I go to buy melon onto the market.

299
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:09,796
The vendor very much meggyõzõen says it, that
the melon ripened and beautiful, but

300
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:17,079
till then, you do not take it home and up not
you kill it, very heavy to judge, how.

301
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,081
However here, here not an dinnyérõl
there is a word!

302
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,240
The melon who may be végülis to get rid of
into the garbage.

303
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,772
Since Tud, this man
a punishment lasting for life threatens it,

304
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:53,163
we now all of them we elect it and
õt it is imprisoned forever.

305
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:56,159
And never comes out from there.

306
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:01,167
It is understood altogether?! Never.

307
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:03,158
Let them reflect on him only into this word!

308
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:09,407
So-ha does not come out from there.

309
00:24:09,442 --> 00:24:11,159
And is in this manner properly.

310
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:14,161
Why would he be needed some other way? Killer!

311
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,555
We should send it onto Thailand possibly to be on holiday?

312
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:22,157
Let him be glad that there is not death penalty already.

313
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:25,080
He learns it then in the prison.

314
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,267
Good.

315
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:47,747
Good.

316
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:50,867
Be

317
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:55,292
I do not want to steal their time,
vote once more.

318
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,878
If I am left alone again, than it elõbb,
I stain likewise to vote, than the others.

319
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:03,332
And let a boy fare for this
shape,

320
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:07,327
végülis I will know it, that at least
I tried to make something for him.

321
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:14,563
A step is interesting! So practically himself
makes the same one, than the others,

322
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:21,765
while he believes it rightfully, that the himself
his hand is clear. Did he believe it in this manner?

323
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:26,027
Yes.

324
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:28,147
In that manner tûnik, in this manner.

325
00:25:29,887 --> 00:25:32,162
Only that request of mine, that the vote
let him be secret.

326
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,107
But why?

327
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,652
Õszintén? I pull it it idõt.

328
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:41,440
It is necessary to catch the paper, the feather, throughout
it is necessary to believe it - this means minutes.

329
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:46,766
Besides very often vote in that manner,
that let them not stick out from the row.

330
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:51,082
I ask him it in exchange for this to be the vote
secret.

331
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:56,915
Secret, open - the result then
obvious.

332
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:18,197
Well, back a proposal arrived secret
onto vote.

333
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:21,561
- Do they agree?
- Yes.

334
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:23,892
- Then
- With these,?

335
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:27,492
Yes, yes, the paper, the pencil are caught,
the feathers are here.

336
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:34,087
If may vote, we look at it then only
Is there everybody on his place? Immediately

337
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:36,442
As if somebody is missing.

338
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:47,079
That lord went out onto WC, I saw.

339
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:50,612
I saw, onto my word of honour.

340
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:53,887
Not, back what let us be waiting?
Vote!

341
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:55,612
- Old man already
- We start it, good?

342
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,447
It already true, while he finds it,
pí-pí, his prostate, adenoma

343
00:26:59,482 --> 00:27:02,644
...aztán to pack
the equipment.

344
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:06,757
Instead of a urn, onto vote.
Vote!

345
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:25,132
I look at it in that manner, this all for himself
not novelty.

346
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:32,207
Old, not to be a pensioner boring
I sit in the holiday house, I paint water-colours.

347
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:34,767
Na I hold a meeting on the court sometimes.

348
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:36,332
Mûvész,?

349
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:41,441
What kind of mûvész. I paint water-colours,
only in that manner mûkedvelõként.

350
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:48,996
Did everybody pass his paper?

351
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:57,652
- Everybody voted?
- Not, we waited for himself.

352
00:27:57,687 --> 00:28:02,126
My grandfather says it:
With peeing and the labour -
it is not possible to wait for it.

353
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:03,967
Let them not be worried, I will be fast.

354
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:05,685
Practically revival.

355
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:12,326
Thank you.

356
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:14,204
- Apology, apology.
- No problem.

357
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:24,847
Back we reckon it up then.

358
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:29,427
Bûnös

359
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:34,987
Bûnös

360
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:39,027
Bûnös

361
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,839
Bûnös

362
00:28:45,647 --> 00:28:47,147
Bûnös

363
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:51,518
Bûnös

364
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:56,627
Bûnös

365
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:02,147
Bûnös

366
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,680
Bûnös

367
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:12,387
Innocent

368
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,067
Bûnös

369
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:38,927
Then back, according to ten "bûnös",
an against it.

370
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:40,462
Kettõ.

371
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:43,159
Kettõ.

372
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:58,772
According to Kettõ innocent.

373
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:01,927
That kettõ? Wait a minute.
It cannot be!

374
00:30:01,962 --> 00:30:05,047
He gives the sheets.
Ellenõrizzük only down

375
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:09,132
No. Is not needed nothing ellenõrizni.

376
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:13,240
I was it, who in that manner voted, that the
a young man is innocent.

377
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:16,827
That-how?

378
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:21,607
Five of his minutes voted for it yet,
that the kid bûnös.

379
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:23,962
Elsõre in that manner tûnt, that the question egyértelmû.

380
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:26,892
And what there is now, not egyértelmû?

381
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:29,572
Not, I may not say it, that not
egyértelmû,

382
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:36,087
but this man called, that let me buy it
onto myself the felelõsséget it õ for his decision.

383
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:40,047
And it is known, I reflected.

384
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:41,582
Mirõl?

385
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:46,447
Let him not be angry, but himself did not have me.
This is some kind of Jewish logic.

386
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:49,519
He is in this manner perfectly.
I am Jewish.

387
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,572
A hundred are Jews in a percentage.

388
00:30:51,607 --> 00:30:54,652
For all men,
I have many deficiencies,

389
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:59,647
but I have a virtue, and it is known,
this a Jewish characteristic was born,
...elgondolkodni.

390
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:00,886
I hold a high opinion of this.

391
00:31:00,887 --> 00:31:04,607
I reflected, and I went away onto WC.
To think.

392
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:07,280
And it is known, to doubt I started.

393
00:31:07,487 --> 00:31:08,806
Why?

394
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:10,399
The lawyer.

395
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,325
What is there with the lawyer?

396
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:15,722
He was bored.

397
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:20,212
Would have been Mitõl jókedvû?
This Chechen monster killed his father.

398
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:23,867
It was my impression, that altogether
he did not protect the defendant.

399
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:27,487
And correct, how did not protect it, what
was not why to protect.

400
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,557
Exactly. Exactly.

401
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,532
Was not why. The boy is penniless.

402
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:36,367
The lawyer's eyes empty,
his face is bloated.

403
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:38,092
He was not able to work altogether.

404
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:40,516
Himself did not like the lawyer,
because not Jew?

405
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:44,987
Alcoholic, but honest - did not leave it,
that let the killer come out from the loop.

406
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:48,292
For himself suddenly in that manner tûnt
Let him cross himself, if something in that manner tûnik.

407
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:53,127
Ten felnõtt for a man not tûnt up nothing,
for himself suddenly, from one of the moments
onto the other one, yes.

408
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,357
- In the loo.
- Punctually, in the loo tûnt in that manner.

409
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:59,847
I can be thinking well there.
Everybody can be thinking well there.

410
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:02,012
Why is he agitated?
Let him not be agitated.

411
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:07,087
Themselves are on ten here, we only
two people. We should be agitated.

412
00:32:07,122 --> 00:32:10,567
I am nervous though.
Knows it, I am agitated.

413
00:32:10,602 --> 00:32:12,132
And I am not top notch not to be agitated.

414
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:17,799
Because I see it, himself the Jew
gets this tangled up with his tricks the totally
clear case.

415
00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:20,212
Himself did not like the lawyer already.

416
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:22,812
There is something, modifies it immediately
his opinion.

417
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:25,972
Since this typical
typically Jew.

418
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:31,320
Na enough! I my own opinion not
I modified it, I am Jewish half though.

419
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,597
There are not Jews half.

420
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:39,400
This now good, you are bad?

421
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:42,804
For you countryman certainly

422
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:48,907
he is not doing well.

423
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,950
An, kettõ, three, four, five

424
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:46,044
Watch the boy being glad about your gift.

425
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,206
Umarik!

426
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:53,207
Umarik, come to dine,
Vologya arrived uncle.

427
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:17,367
All right. Let them listen, they agreed now
a good, neat, naive man,

428
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,687
...akit onto their own side claimed.

429
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:21,588
We the curl rhymes with a word?

430
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:23,442
- What?
- Curl, hair, rhyme.

431
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:25,197
Let him leave this now.
Curl - treasure.

432
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:30,612
Perfectly am gyõzõdve from that direction,
that who we can be acting uniform
opinion.

433
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:36,087
It pulls it only idõt and say yet
some example tale from that direction, how is needed
to select the melon.

434
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:38,807
You are now just how is needed
to buy fresh fish.

435
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:40,246
True, I do not understand it we from an aim.

436
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:44,407
Let him impose us on new one to repeat
all that, that already 3 of his days we keep silent
on the court,

437
00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:47,772
all 100%-os evidence for this the
for a villain the bûnösségérõl,

438
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:51,767
what he cannot disprove, what
irrefutable.

439
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:53,166
So what?

440
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:57,247
It idõs a lord goes away once more the
onto a loo and thinks through it once more,

441
00:34:57,282 --> 00:34:59,522
it modifies his decision
onto one single correct one.

442
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:03,947
Let it be believed, will be in this manner.
In no way some other way.

443
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:07,692
I do not understand it only, we he makes sense
for this it idõhúzásnak?

444
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:10,807
Let us start revising the testimonies again?

445
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,092
Himself is not a blind deaf-mute.

446
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:17,407
Since sat in the conference room there,
he saw that bastard on his prisoner have dock.

447
00:35:17,442 --> 00:35:19,687
Says it: We talk it over, back then
we speak it.

448
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:21,206
On him, we talk it over.

449
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:26,486
What kind of words may say to this brute
in his protection, onto which is not and not too
may be any kind of excuse?

450
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:32,447
A what kind of excuse this may have the
for a monster, who raised a hand, the
nevelõapjára, onto a retired position?

451
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:37,092
And not only egyszerûen raised his hand against him,
but slaughters it, than a lamb.

452
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:42,047
Understand? Killed that man, who
ensured him, cipõt, bought dresses
for him, raised it.

453
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:45,892
Killed the man who nothing is
he did not do bad for him!

454
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:50,212
Not only that nothing, but just
ellenkezõleg, adopted it as a son, saved it!

455
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:55,807
And does not count, why destroyed it, the
for his cheap pension, or an shouted
for an insult.

456
00:35:55,842 --> 00:35:57,206
This is uninteresting for me.

457
00:35:57,207 --> 00:36:00,172
I do not know it how they are with him, but for me this
he does not fit into my head.

458
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:04,727
I would not be able to say one single word to this
onto the excuse of the garbage.

459
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,262
For this garbage!

460
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:09,160
I believe it in that manner nobody would be top notch here,
themselves would not be top notch.

461
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,927
Why was needed then into this whole one
to start it? I

462
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:23,587
Sorry.

463
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:27,006
I had a wife

464
00:36:27,007 --> 00:36:29,172
We leave the wives késõbbre.
He was three for me.

465
00:36:29,207 --> 00:36:31,727
Wait! Wait!
Was my wife and I loved very much õt.

466
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:33,098
Ate a piece of meat - destroyed it because of this.

467
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:34,366
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Vegetarian.

468
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:36,212
Wait! Wait!
I loved very much õt.

469
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:39,772
Csertanovoban was a change of our room,
practically without furniture.

470
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:43,595
We had to dine on the floor yet, because
was not ebédlõasztalunk.

471
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:51,362
Kezdõ I was a scientific colleague it
in one physical Tudományos Kutató Intézet
and I drew up an own idea.

472
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:58,398
My wife was obliged because of this three
to work on a workplace, that
let us be successful somehow.

473
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:02,886
Shortly, I invented it a new tunnel-diódát.

474
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:05,401
This would be complicated to explain what should do.

475
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:12,478
In the institute praise, gave 50 rubles
premium, and it was recommended, deal
with something else.

476
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:19,156
In this manner back I leaded home my three-year work
his result, the 50 rubles.

477
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:25,686
My wife looked at me with a look like that,

478
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:34,847
One of the big western firms offered it,
that buys my patent,
for a huge sum.

479
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:37,772
But I - not! I wanted it, that it here,
at us mûködjön.

480
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:41,887
I went onto the other one from one of the offices,
I offered it, it was called me:
This nagyszerû"

481
00:37:41,922 --> 00:37:44,037
Nobody needs him!
For nobody!

482
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:48,412
I started drinking. Awfully.

483
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:53,207
I lost my work, leafed the
my wife, for me was nothing
it is important apart from drinking.

484
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:54,932
In the morning, in daytime, in the evening.

485
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:59,085
Reggeltõl until a night terribly drunk
was! He was Szörnyû.

486
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:02,998
I felt in that manner once, that soon
I die.

487
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:06,607
And it is known, I was glad about this yet
for the thought.

488
00:38:06,642 --> 00:38:08,325
Altogether not alarmed.

489
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:11,802
I wanted only one - mielõbb.

490
00:38:12,047 --> 00:38:15,835
And I started looking for the death.
Onto my word of honour, was in this manner.
I started looking for the death.

491
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,727
I fought the rendõrökkel, I found fault with it
into the peoples, the neighbours.

492
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:21,445
Beat, knife.

493
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:25,196
I worked the night in doorways, in hospitals
I tossed!

494
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:27,047
Beat, onto bloody one beaten!

495
00:38:27,082 --> 00:38:30,119
It doesnot matter. I climbed out.

496
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:35,725
At home, than an házõrzõ dog,
I lick away at my wounds,
and I struggle out again.

497
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:41,359
An valamitõl I am concerned about it - to jump in front of a train
and to spring out from the window. Ettõl somehow
I am concerned about it. I donot know why.

498
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,187
I am concerned about it.

499
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:50,038
I traveled by the train once, terribly
drunk, dirtily, stinkingly.

500
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,667
He was stuffed with peoples.

501
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:56,206
I found fault with the peoples again.
I was yelling, I swore!

502
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:59,247
And it is known, I was watching myself kívülrõl
and I rejoiced.

503
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:01,920
On my own obscenity - I rejoiced!

504
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:07,887
I dreamed about only a thing, that
let there be at least a man,

505
00:39:07,922 --> 00:39:11,447
who would catch and would throw out from the train
during procession.

506
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,359
In that manner, that my head crush on the rails.
Onto pieces.

507
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,844
Not, everybody was sitting only and kept silent.

508
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:22,561
Their head was turned away, but they were sitting
and they kept silent.

509
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:29,042
An nõ with his exception, who is an one around five years
he traveled with a little girl.

510
00:39:30,607 --> 00:39:34,998
I heard it, the little girl said it:
Mom, the uncle õrült, I am afraid tõle".

511
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:42,683
The nõ though it responded:
Not, õ not õrült,

512
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,483
he is very badly only.

513
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,640
I sold my technology an western
for a firm.

514
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:07,082
This mûködik practically on all of them the second
in a mobile telephone.

515
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,327
I though - I am for this company the
képviselõje. But not this the important.

516
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:17,596
It the nõ, now my wife,
the little girl - my daughter.

517
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:19,878
We have even a boy.

518
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,547
Four are year.

519
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:27,987
Did he finish it?

520
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,683
No, not yet.

521
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:55,521
May be, that for that boy the
he has to die in a prison.

522
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,121
May be, who knows that this is his fate.

523
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:02,796
Since for me under the fence
I should have died.

524
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:04,347
But I did not die.

525
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:12,001
A man dared Egyetlen!
...figyelmesebb was to me,

526
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:14,679
than all the others.

527
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:21,684
And did not allow it, that in outrage and
let me stay in solitude.

528
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,667
I finished it now.

529
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:43,719
Well

530
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:50,038
this is the moving story of a rescue.

531
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:52,717
But this his own story.

532
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:55,325
And himself destroyed nobody.

533
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:03,366
This though here - the story of a murder,
with one-hundred-percent evidences the boy
bûnösségét illetõen.

534
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:08,998
His old testimony from the lower flat,

535
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:13,723
who heard the quarreling and
the boy's shouting: I will kill you!.

536
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:17,247
The boy says that he did not destroy it
the nevelõapját.

537
00:42:17,282 --> 00:42:19,841
Why, what should say?
Did I destroy it?

538
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:22,242
Back we would not ride it here then.

539
00:42:22,277 --> 00:42:24,238
For me õszintének tûnnek his words.

540
00:42:24,487 --> 00:42:27,887
Since knows it hardly even in Russian
to express.

541
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:31,252
Enough! What?!
Mirõl they speak?!

542
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:35,492
Here let them keep silent! Embe! Totally!
I spit on the fact that he speaks in Russian!

543
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:41,087
Already indulgence, but themselves all felnõtt
peoples, they are not ashame of themselves,
let them be watching already circle!

544
00:42:41,122 --> 00:42:44,364
Since this already not too our city!
Everything was occupied!

545
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:47,572
Everything. The markets, the casinos,
the hotels. Everything is theirs!

546
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:51,767
I tried to drive it over yesterday with my Volga River
on Teatralnij keresztutcán

547
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,932
Eight are lanes! Eight lanes - and all stuffed!

548
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:58,247
The Bentley-jeik, Mercedes-eik, it is understood,
it is not possible to go over!

549
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:01,527
There some wedding party was kept -
you sing, they danced,

550
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:03,732
just only not lõttek the levegõbe
with the Kalasnyikov reason!

551
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:07,572
And all this three! Under the three minute roads
Ljubjankától!

552
00:43:07,607 --> 00:43:12,387
This is not Moscow already! This anything -
Baku nought, anything, but not Moscow!

553
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:17,167
And I, I, was born Moscow, here, the
myself find it strange in my own city!

554
00:43:17,202 --> 00:43:18,844
Myself feel it in that manner, as if in company
would be!

555
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:20,452
But back for that boy we his alley to this?

556
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:24,092
What boy? What is there already with the boy?
Tries to protect it,?

557
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:29,247
Imagine only away, let him remember him,
was a word from that direction, that elõzõleg
did he fall out with his father?

558
00:43:29,282 --> 00:43:32,972
Let us imagine a Russian kid. What
makes in this case a Russian kid?

559
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:37,847
May be, that to bully tooth, megsértõdik,
na and finally, I do not know it, escapes possibly
from home!

560
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:40,772
But does not take a knife in his hand!

561
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:48,007
That savage, his own barbarian boy,
that animal, conceals his offence, because of that,
that let him recur and cuts his throat off.

562
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,126
Embarks the knife!

563
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,447
Back it is known, this because of that after all exaggeration!

564
00:43:51,482 --> 00:43:53,732
Barbarians.
After all the XXI. we live in a hundred.

565
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:57,127
Next it would not be necessary to exaggerate it in this manner
the things.

566
00:43:57,162 --> 00:44:00,487
We, anyway, we make very big work.

567
00:44:00,522 --> 00:44:03,207
Who it the themselves? Who are you? Who?

568
00:44:03,242 --> 00:44:04,686
Who are you?

569
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:06,678
Democratic erõk.

570
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:08,267
That how?

571
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:10,119
How erõk?

572
00:44:11,727 --> 00:44:13,652
I agree on the other hand.

573
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:17,441
Not, I not from that direction in connection with Az

574
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:20,721
Scum these! Scum.

575
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:25,520
In private - normal, but if in more
are old-old-old

576
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:28,732
This train is here, I travel, freedom.

577
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:35,206
Four beasts, one aim a knife at me
rob, kettõ holds my hand down,

578
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:37,636
the fourth rummages in my pockets.

579
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:42,920
Not from that direction there is a word, that scared
I got frightened.

580
00:44:45,887 --> 00:44:48,407
That psychopath called off with the gas.

581
00:44:48,442 --> 00:44:50,443
I came to myself - Simferopol.

582
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:54,044
Na, next Lovustban,
kettõt in the bazaar

583
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:56,166
Yeah. - I say it.

584
00:44:56,167 --> 00:45:00,647
Recognize, they came for me directly,
my thongs started being licked away at.

585
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:03,684
Ours összegyûltek, it was fenced in.

586
00:45:03,807 --> 00:45:07,038
Repelled, I caught it, in this manner,
I save it, I leaded away

587
00:45:08,847 --> 00:45:11,077
And I kicked into an ass, in this manner na!

588
00:45:11,927 --> 00:45:15,237
My foot was strained, I was top notch hardly
to go home.

589
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:19,322
My loin hurts. I
Is himself a doctor?

590
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:22,227
I am a surgeon.

591
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:23,926
Thank you.

592
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:27,476
Not, surgeon egyelõre is not needed,
then kenõccsel I am smearing it.

593
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:31,560
Scum these! Scum.

594
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:42,000
If he did not commit a murder once, not all the same,
how speaks in Russian,

595
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:45,797
respected juror lords?

596
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,707
Right.

597
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:49,139
You like that?

598
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,640
I love it.

599
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,795
Look at it, how beautiful.

600
00:46:57,497 --> 00:46:59,097
Thank you.

601
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:20,641
Umar! Umar!

602
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,030
Come on!

603
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,503
I said it, come home!

604
00:48:29,004 --> 00:48:32,504
Do not be angry, my father calls lesson to make.

605
00:48:32,505 --> 00:48:36,505
Do not be worried, my son, even you get even your share of him ebbõl
from the war.

606
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:44,476
Hé, my friend, it do not teach it at a school
to fight.

607
00:48:44,477 --> 00:48:47,477
What you said my friend? Törõdj the own
with your thing

608
00:48:49,087 --> 00:48:52,176
We are at home, we are successful somehow

00:48:52,247 --> 00:48:53,747
Come home, Umar!

610
00:48:56,897 --> 00:48:58,897
Wolf-cub, be added to me.

611
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:03,427
Let's go.

612
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,400
Who his head behind a woman's skirt
hides it, elsõként will lose it.

613
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,806
...egy, kettõ, three, four, five

614
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:12,920
Anyway, I demanded it in order for it to be brought here
the knife, with which the murder was committed.

615
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:14,812
Why?

616
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:20,046
Dared only on the court steadily it
it was stressed that this is some kind
extraordinary knife, special.

617
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:23,587
And that

618
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:26,867
I say thank you for it thankfully.

619
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:29,602
And that, supposedly only for that boy
he was like this.

620
00:50:33,207 --> 00:50:35,092
Let them remember.

621
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:40,679
On the court whole idõ it was said,
that this some kind of unique knife.

622
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:43,707
Egyszerûen is special.

623
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:46,907
That is it.

624
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,547
Let it be allowed only!

625
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:57,397
A special knife is a yes, this.

626
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,123
Single special rendeltetésû
subunits he may be systematized.

627

Emerson with an American sample is similar féle
"CQC7 close combat onto a knife.

628
00:51:09,922 --> 00:51:12,276
Old, with a name provided.

629
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:17,047
The kid Csecsenföldrõl may have brought it
this knife.

630
00:51:17,082 --> 00:51:20,302
It is possible to obtain it on the black market yet there.

631
00:51:20,337 --> 00:51:23,522
It is not possible to buy a knife like this in Moscow.

632
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:29,285
This knife terrible pervasive erõvel
he takes action.

633
00:51:29,607 --> 00:51:32,246
OH! Not nothing!

634

FATHER
MOTHER

635
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:42,547
The situation it, that

636
00:52:42,847 --> 00:52:50,800
...a special unit õrnagya was.
His subunit just on that area
he fought where the defendant lived.

637
00:52:50,927 --> 00:52:53,236
Picked the boy up, adopted it next.

638
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:58,127
- Did he lose something possibly?
- No
- And what there is if these are the armed men,

639
00:52:58,162 --> 00:53:02,484
...katonák, just õk it was murdered the
a boy's parents?

640
00:53:03,607 --> 00:53:05,572
This is a motive. Motive to the murder.

641
00:53:05,607 --> 00:53:09,167
Yes, yes, of course, but the situation it, that
the nevelõapja knew it since five of his year ages
the boy.

642
00:53:09,202 --> 00:53:10,972
He was good at a friendship with his parents.

643
00:53:11,007 --> 00:53:14,407
Not, I in connection with the knife.
Who does he belong to?

644
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:16,637
It is known, the drop caps are there.

645
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:20,252
And these the kezdõbetûk they do not pass
one szereplõhöz neither.

646
00:53:20,287 --> 00:53:26,396
Rare knife, it was kept in the house and
the kid dragged it along with himself always.

647
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:30,036
His companions saw the knife, this at him declared
on the court.

648
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:35,844
Yes, you talk about it steadily, that this
an exceptionally rare knife. Special.

649
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:39,532
Look at it, a what kind of picture starts taking shape.

650
00:53:39,567 --> 00:53:42,367
- What is he looking for?
- I find it in no way

651
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:43,806
Did I not lose it only?

652
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:49,947
Was walking with a word, was walking, was walking, once
somebody goes there to it only and says it:

653
00:53:49,982 --> 00:53:56,052
Be listening boy, you do not know it accidentally
where is it possible to get a so good knife here?

654
00:53:56,087 --> 00:54:03,047
In this direction õ: Back I would know it sure!
Is for me, good knife this, rare, special.

655
00:54:03,082 --> 00:54:05,972
Sold it, chance purchase, yes.

656
00:54:06,007 --> 00:54:10,523
The boy sold the knife, the man bought it,
he went away to kill his father next.

657
00:54:11,687 --> 00:54:14,247
Curly is crystal clear.

658
00:54:15,727 --> 00:54:18,327
- What?
- Nonsense, nonsense.

659
00:54:18,362 --> 00:54:20,252
Stand, stand, stand.

660
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:24,758
But back money was found in his pocket - 7 thousand.

661
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:31,806
7 thousand - so exactly so much, than it
a father's pension, which he obtained same day,.

662
00:54:31,847 --> 00:54:33,847
But what kind sold? What kind of knife?

663
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:36,600
Destroyed it and robbed it.

664
00:54:36,727 --> 00:54:40,372
To keep silent the defendant kid's little tales -
a thing is meaningless.

665
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:43,647
- Other knife like this egyszerûen impossible
here to obtain, children.
- I found it!

666
00:54:43,682 --> 00:54:46,887
Thank God. It is known, small the key
and I believed it lost.

667
00:54:46,922 --> 00:54:50,516
He hid in my pocket though.

668
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,603
I thought that the knife is unique,
special.

669
00:54:57,367 --> 00:54:59,164
And, that may have been at that boy only.

670
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:01,707
Let it be looked at only.

671
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:03,667
Here.

672
00:55:05,047 --> 00:55:06,547
Oops!

673
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,612
An it in one.

674
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:14,763
There is even an account from him.

675
00:55:18,927 --> 00:55:22,727
It was said that it is this only,
special and that was for the boy only
so.

676
00:55:22,762 --> 00:55:26,446
It was on Extrém piacon -
totally freely.

677
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:37,867
So what?

678
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:41,367
What does this prove? That it on the suckle
did he not kill his father?

679
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:43,087
Not, this proves nothing.

680
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:44,366
Is it allowed to smoke here?

681
00:55:44,367 --> 00:55:47,647
- Why not? We are locked
- Give I am asking it a thread.

682
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:48,646
- Here.
- Thank you.

683
00:55:48,647 --> 00:55:51,487
- This proves nothing.
- Na is well, is well,
- My task was totally other.

684
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:55,484
...találta this knife.
- Not, I bought it.
- Good, bought it, bought it. What is the difference?

685
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,423
I believe it - bought it. Nowadays anything may be
for money to have bought, even rocket rack.

686
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:05,327
Yes! Tells me it, how proves it
this it, that the person who bought it from the boy
the knife,

687
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,862
is it the killer just?

688
00:56:06,887 --> 00:56:10,641
May I? This in no way
This does not prove it, only dot
interrupted.

689
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:13,867
Thank you.

690
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:19,007
I wanted to say it, that for this knife
the charge was his individuality fõ his argument.

691
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,006
Let them remember only.

692
00:56:20,007 --> 00:56:22,727
It lightens up though now - it is possible to buy one like this
egyszerûen.

693
00:56:22,762 --> 00:56:25,492
So what? What doe that mean?

694
00:56:25,527 --> 00:56:28,883
This means it, that the investigation not too
it was conducted conscientiously.

695
00:56:29,527 --> 00:56:31,892
- It may be him then that the others are a fact
- The lawyer.

696
00:56:31,927 --> 00:56:37,327
The lawyer. Was not what to say.
A shape is frivolous. He was not able to save.

697
00:56:37,362 --> 00:56:43,721
And what there is what there is if it is who
bought the knife - it destroyed it.

698
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,867
Oh, my God!

699
00:56:46,407 --> 00:56:50,241
Countryman, mitõl your brain is on his place
is a cheese melted?

700
00:56:50,927 --> 00:56:56,240
Who bought it Valaki destroyed it. You yourself
what is what you say for you at least?

701
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:59,487
Five of his minutes are not yet, that a book-keeping
drew here for us.

702
00:56:59,522 --> 00:57:01,318
Who killed it yet and robbed it.

703
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:06,447
But for who for something else, than for that hybrid,
in his stood interest to kill the retired
õrnagyot for his pension?

704
00:57:06,482 --> 00:57:11,007
Knows it, I would listen to it in his own place
the "Metróépítõ"- and a colleague's opinion.

705
00:57:11,042 --> 00:57:15,956
- Knows it, himself is thinking in that manner
- Than a Jew?

706
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:19,487
Why, would like me thinking in that manner,
than former Jasser Arafat?

707
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:22,852
- All right. Not, but, let him be waiting, let him be waiting
- This is good!

708
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:28,767
All right. Good, this worker man said
some folly, but why himself needs him
to support?

709
00:57:28,802 --> 00:57:31,572
Knows it, does not say a folly.

710
00:57:31,607 --> 00:57:33,996
A back knows it, these tricks
jellemzõek.

711
00:57:34,887 --> 00:57:40,644
If Jew did not say the folly -
is properly, if though Jew - then
already not folly.

712
00:57:41,447 --> 00:57:45,692
All right. The knife - tallies, punctually
just like that - I agree.

713
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:52,280
But the man, who bought this knife,,
the abbot destroyed it with him next - it we,
is a coincidence chance likewise?

714
00:57:53,087 --> 00:57:58,727
Are two chance after each other? Na this already
impossible, so is not.
So may not turn elõ never.

715
00:57:58,762 --> 00:58:03,881
Knows it, I a time of his I believe it in that manner, that it
everything is possible in a life.

716
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:07,167
Absolutely on all of them, even it,
what is impossible.

717
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:10,320
My father

718
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:14,692
he was in a ghetto under the war.

719
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:17,639
- Does himself want to tell a story to us about the holocaust?
- Not, from my father.

720
00:58:17,967 --> 00:58:22,212
Lithuanian SS was stationed there just
one are his subunits.

721
00:58:22,247 --> 00:58:27,167
Was a position there, for who an gyönyörû
his wife was Lithuanian.

722
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:30,125
My father skinny man

723
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,363
Am I seen? - You would eat trebly worse.

724
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,292
Indulgence, külsõleg it himself resembles his father?

725
00:58:40,327 --> 00:58:44,327
Not, onto my mother. My mother was not likewise
a beauty, but at my father because of that more beautiful.

726
00:58:44,362 --> 00:58:48,002
And back my father, onto his ruin, fell in love with it.

727
00:58:48,647 --> 00:58:53,567
I do not know it, what was biting him, but
he fell in love with this Lithuanian beauty.

728
00:58:53,602 --> 00:58:58,452
And õ, õ too fell in love with my father,
than a girlie.

729
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:02,487
It can be imagined, what would have been with them,
if ours, it do not come Russians?

730
00:59:02,522 --> 00:59:07,607
It SS-es escaped the Reich-in,
his wife was left with my father.

731
00:59:08,887 --> 00:59:10,852
Oh, my God.

732
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:14,772
Mindkettõjüket számûzték into Siberia,
into compulsion camps, long idõre.

733
00:59:14,807 --> 00:59:19,612
They broke out in 1953, it was found
each other and they got married.

734
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:25,407
They settled down in a little village, somewhere
Near Vilnius and it was started excitedly
to produce the children.

735
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:26,942
Eleven men.

736
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:32,367
This elõtt of course my father, garbage on a manner,
he left my mother.

737
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,959
But I understand it õt.

738
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:39,683
Elõször, I saw his photograph.

739
00:59:46,847 --> 00:59:49,042
I saw his photograph.

740
00:59:52,127 --> 00:59:54,083
Secondly though

741
00:59:56,887 --> 00:59:59,117
my mother was not likewise an fõnyeremény.

742
01:00:01,767 --> 01:00:03,644
His mother - not fõnyeremény.

743
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:10,164
Touching story.

744
01:00:14,127 --> 01:00:18,484
If somebody would tell this story to me,
I would believe him it in no way.

745
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:23,047
But this occurred with my father.

746
01:00:24,047 --> 01:00:25,685
Everything possible.

747
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:28,667
Everything.

748
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:09,086
Stand, stand. Stop!

749
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:11,804
Not dubious, that everybody has him the
his story is own.

750
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,521
Everybody digs his garden on his own manner.

751
01:01:14,647 --> 01:01:16,763
And holds the shovel on his own manner.

752
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,046
Well Na, back

753
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:21,403
Back, if themselves would know it
I have a uncle, a relative.

754
01:01:21,447 --> 01:01:24,996
In a small town beside an edge, Voronyezs,
lakatos-vízvezetékszerelõ.

755
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:32,607
He has a golden hand! Ready, neat
All of the city with a word with him

Back, in that manner. Õ was sipping, of course.

757
01:01:35,777 --> 01:01:38,842
But not malicious. Not it, that
Every now and then.

758
01:01:39,847 --> 01:01:45,652
Is there in the centre
there is a space.

759
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:50,327
It was set up there the, establishment
With a word, to play with it it
with an automaton, for money.

760
01:01:50,362 --> 01:01:53,046
"Testvér-nek it is called. Sibling.

761
01:01:53,287 --> 01:01:59,527
Na, Kolja a uncle was playing never, now
here the payment, drank of course, next there.

762
01:01:59,562 --> 01:02:08,242
There. With a word, lost, lost everything
it last kopejkáig.

763
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:18,362
How I am going now home, - believed it -
Ljubához, to my wife, how I say it
for him, that I lost all of the money.

764
01:02:18,407 --> 01:02:21,772
How? Egyszerûbb, if he hangs himself.

765
01:02:21,807 --> 01:02:28,927
Good peoples told it in confidence-is here not far
an office, it is possible to put on money for a credit there.

766
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:32,283
In this direction õ there. It is said there - our trump.

767
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:37,747
But onto only a year, an interest.

768
01:02:37,782 --> 01:02:39,772
And less, than 50 thousand, may not give.

769
01:02:39,807 --> 01:02:44,732
Catch it if he is needed it fifty, if not,
go into the hell.

770
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:52,003
Õ, Nincs what to do, it catches it
50 thousand and direction again the sibling.

771
01:02:56,807 --> 01:03:01,972
And lost everything! All 50 thousand.

772
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:06,319
Now next we be
For him now even

The office is bright daytime, a direction.

774
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:23,292
The fõnök says it:
Are a thousand 50? We it, went crazy?

775
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:27,505
Went crazy?! Na be waiting only! -
home, weapon, small shot

776
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:31,683
And back. The fõnök by that time somewhere
he escaped.

777
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:34,772
The book-keeping is a direction. There all nõ.

778
01:03:34,807 --> 01:03:41,758
Hármójukat takes it hostage,
he becomes terrorist.

779
01:03:42,647 --> 01:03:46,720
Forces it egyikõjüket to put out an
bucket onto the porch with a tag.

780
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:54,767
There his claim: 57 thousand rubles, flat

781
01:03:54,802 --> 01:03:59,158
and an repülõ an tetszõlegesen granted
onto a dot.

782
01:03:59,847 --> 01:04:05,447
Why he needs him fõmérnöki arrangement, if
does he want to fly away once?

783
01:04:05,482 --> 01:04:08,439
Na, but this not important.
This is not important.

784
01:04:10,607 --> 01:04:13,367
The women - Kolja uncle, what you do,
look at it

785
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:16,404
Õ like that ajajaj,
cannot sound nothing.

786
01:04:16,447 --> 01:04:20,347
The women caught it, the safe was opened,
800 rubles were withdrawn,

787
01:04:20,382 --> 01:04:24,247
one ran away for vodka, brought for,
is afraid with a chest, ice-cream

788
01:04:24,282 --> 01:04:26,317
There already the rendõrség, marksmen!

01:04:26,687 --> 01:04:29,172
Aim the terrorist, nothing, tûz!

790
01:04:29,207 --> 01:04:36,318
In this direction the rendõr commander - Stop!
Onto no case! Le with the weapons!
Then I, personally
This is the man though!

791
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:39,572
Went there, alone, unarmed
This is the man though!

792
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:43,087
Kolja a uncle aims the weapon at his stomach
- I destroy you. In this direction õ - do not kill.

793
01:04:43,122 --> 01:04:44,206
I destroy you.
Do not kill.

794
01:04:44,207 --> 01:04:46,012
It again - I destroy you.
Do not kill.

795
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:49,247
Why?
Because I am the commander -
the commander said it.

796
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:52,125
Kolja a uncle threw away the weapon.

797
01:04:52,727 --> 01:05:00,884
They sat down beside the chest and they drank.
They were crying.

798
01:05:02,487 --> 01:05:05,126
No court, no investigation.

799
01:05:19,527 --> 01:05:24,087
Apology, why told it actually
away for us all this?

800
01:05:24,122 --> 01:05:26,852
Back, that Ha
In a normal case,

801
01:05:26,887 --> 01:05:31,119
it would have been necessary to send it into a prison, on a brain
would have been needed lõni. Terrorist!

802
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:35,326
The rendõr commander
What is a man! This is the man though!
...nem nothing.

803
01:05:35,361 --> 01:05:39,986
Kolja a uncle works, his debt
he paid it off. I helped a small one for him.

804
01:05:40,007 --> 01:05:43,247
The rendõr commander elõléptették,
he was a businessman.

805
01:05:43,282 --> 01:05:49,172
The sibling t kindled it.
Somebody else, not Kolja uncle.

806
01:05:49,207 --> 01:05:56,522
Not, this nagyszerû, only quasi,
we everything has something to do with our case?

807
01:05:57,447 --> 01:06:02,680
If Hogyha
I am beside the good one.

808
01:06:02,927 --> 01:06:06,452
Igeeen! You next quickly blew out,
sibling.

809
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:10,127
This is not needed, is not needed, for me here not
there is a melted cheese.

810
01:06:10,162 --> 01:06:15,247
The neat one has to help it, the bad one

811
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,926
Hells!

812
01:06:18,927 --> 01:06:23,717
Vote - the Chechen child not bûnös.
Let him write it down. Thank you.

813
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:28,522
Back, knows it this elképesztõ!

814
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:32,125
From what kind of jurisdiction may be here
to speak?

815
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:35,887
The locksmith Kolja is running around on a Bács drunk
in the city!

816
01:06:35,922 --> 01:06:39,012
The rendõrfõnök, Ljosa uncle vodkázik with him!

817
01:06:39,047 --> 01:06:43,967
The urban prosecutor, Vaszja uncle, eye
he naps above all these.

818
01:06:44,002 --> 01:06:46,356
The bûnözõ is left at large!

819
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:55,567
And all this like that idõkben, when it is whole
civilized world already since centuries
he lives according to laws!

820
01:06:58,327 --> 01:07:01,327
The Russian man never stains in the life
to live according to the laws.

821
01:07:01,362 --> 01:07:02,406
Why?

822
01:07:02,407 --> 01:07:05,046
He is boring for him according to the law.

823
01:07:06,247 --> 01:07:07,747
The law - dead person.

824
01:07:08,327 --> 01:07:10,158
There is nothing personal in him.

825
01:07:11,207 --> 01:07:14,916
The Russian man, personal contacts
- useless.

826
01:07:15,807 --> 01:07:17,281
Neither to steal, neither õrizni.

827
01:07:17,282 --> 01:07:19,212
Since this terrible!

828
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:21,372
And who said that this is good?

829
01:07:21,407 --> 01:07:24,767
Let this pipe, this horror be looked at.

830
01:07:24,802 --> 01:07:26,492
Since this pornography!

831
01:07:26,527 --> 01:07:31,840
Real pornography in Moscow's centre,
in a school incidentally, where children
they study.

832
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:35,603
It believes them építõknek, who
make forget fûtéscsöveket to build
to an apartment house,

833
01:07:35,647 --> 01:07:41,438
when you go to themselves, was doing here already
the school it would be necessary to tear their hand, their foot out.
Into a prison to close. All of them.

834
01:07:42,007 --> 01:07:47,365
According to this law. But they are here the
personal contacts. Human. Russians.

835
01:07:47,487 --> 01:07:52,247
It was talked over with the school, that
temporarily on a terrible manner like this
this pipe is fixed.

836
01:07:52,282 --> 01:07:58,087
Temporarily. It, that all this how
szörnyû has an effect on the pupils,
already because of their childhood

837
01:07:58,122 --> 01:08:00,078
The bra was left because of this possibly
in WC.

838
01:08:01,207 --> 01:08:02,799
...nem excites nobody!

839
01:08:04,047 --> 01:08:06,481
Na and how the law comes here?

840
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,964
The human contacts.

841
01:08:10,647 --> 01:08:12,285
Tessék, let them take delight!

842
01:08:16,727 --> 01:08:26,007
Inventory number 721799
Eaglet úttörõtábor, 1967.

843
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:28,881
I was not born yet.

844
01:08:28,916 --> 01:08:31,720
Well?! How about this? What?

845
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:37,367
40 years passed. 40 are years!
We we cannot come out hitherto
from the coma.

846
01:08:37,402 --> 01:08:41,519
Into the sack the eternal champions of running.

847
01:08:44,247 --> 01:08:49,799
Over. The train left.
The others left, I I stayed here.

848
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:55,759
And vote - the Chechen child not bûnös.

849
01:08:56,607 --> 01:08:58,404
Let him write it down. And dot.

850
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:00,446
The good

851
01:09:00,447 --> 01:09:05,167
Their good sweet mommy!
We this what there is with themselves, what mûvelnek?

852
01:09:05,202 --> 01:09:08,807
- I, anyway, I join likewise!
- This is a circus!

853
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:09,926
Writes it only down!

854
01:09:09,927 --> 01:09:12,207
- On him, let us join all of them!
- Very interesting.

855
01:09:12,242 --> 01:09:15,452
I believe it in that manner, that the boy not bûnös!

856
01:09:15,487 --> 01:09:21,532
Yes. And for me, anyway, solid
I have doubts.

857
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:28,518
Explains it to us if he destroyed it and
cleaned it out the nevelõapját,

858
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:33,847
why recurred with this money the
bûncselekmény onto his site?

859
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:35,732
Really.

860
01:09:35,767 --> 01:09:39,172
A vulgar killer does not make one like this.

861
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:41,572
Let him listen, let him listen
Na is well

862
01:09:41,607 --> 01:09:46,806
But back himself, himself a normal man,
is it a dean that he may speak one like this?

863
01:09:46,847 --> 01:09:52,047
We it, that vulgar killer does not do
one like this? Yes, an vulgar is not going
back, but this yes.

864
01:09:52,082 --> 01:09:55,367
Because this an stupid, mûveletlen savage.

865
01:09:55,402 --> 01:09:57,372
Who climbed down yesterday from the tree only.

866
01:09:57,407 --> 01:09:59,652
What is wanted, that õ it finds it out
"Azazel"- t?

867
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:04,867
But back themselves know it, that for these the
the comprehension of games like that, than
that of a canary.

868
01:10:04,902 --> 01:10:10,047
Do not be angry already, I am asking you, but in no way
I do not understand it, who himself calls a savage?

869
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:12,247
- I came from Caucasus for example.
- Knows that this does not mean it

870
01:10:12,282 --> 01:10:14,892
And Shota Rustaveli? Is Õ a savage?

871
01:10:14,927 --> 01:10:17,007
- Is Piroszmanisvili a savage?
- How comes here?

872
01:10:17,042 --> 01:10:19,172
Szergej Paradzsanov, Danelija?

873
01:10:19,207 --> 01:10:22,372
- Who does himself call a savage?
- I not Shota Rustavelirõl I speak.

874
01:10:22,407 --> 01:10:28,492
- I talk about that bastard, who
he killed his father!
- I, I I talk about myself.

875
01:10:28,527 --> 01:10:34,007
Because I came from Caucasus. Here,
I did it in Moscow the fõiskolát,
after all everybody "tuskó-nak faithful.

876
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:35,972
I am not a trunk though,
but surgeon.

877
01:10:36,007 --> 01:10:39,167
I am a doctor, I have an own clinic.
Understood? Yes.

878
01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:40,732
- Not kétlem, that own.
- Yes.

879
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:43,932
Does not stain of course, apparently already
as a local doctor to work in the hospital.

880
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:48,597
Understand? This not thing like that, than to travel here
from Caucasus, to buy a degree.

881
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:52,212
Who? Who bought it?
I bought it?!

882
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:54,747
- I bought it?!
- I do not talk about himself.
- Be waiting, only, I asked you!

883
01:10:54,782 --> 01:10:57,247
- Not from himself
- Be waiting only, I talk to you! I in that manner
I bought my degree, yes?!

884
01:10:57,282 --> 01:11:01,447
Me. Never. Nothing! And senkitõl I did not buy it!

885
01:11:01,482 --> 01:11:02,246
Do you understand?!

886
01:11:02,247 --> 01:11:05,652
Altogether, that dares?!
How may allow one like this to himself, we?!

887
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:09,772
Only negyedszerre raise the Moscow
Fõiskolára is medical science!

888
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:15,407
And those four years, I got in,
I worked as a nurse throughout the urban
In 1. No. hospital, yes!

889
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:18,164
The mentõknél I worked, the sürgõsségin!

890
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:20,887
And I finished a golden degree! Is that clear?

891
01:11:20,922 --> 01:11:22,246
Eh, with a red degree, na.

892
01:11:22,247 --> 01:11:25,447
Na what there is, I do not speak too well in Russian,
na and? What is there then?

893
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:29,367
I made a mistake, I told it,
I apologised already.

894
01:11:29,402 --> 01:11:31,252
I am a good doctor on the other hand! Is that clear?

895
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,012
- I do not dispute it. Himself is a good doctor.
- Yeah!
- A doctor is good!

896
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:37,347
I do not understand it only, that himself, an good
doctor, why votes for it, that bûnös?

897
01:11:37,382 --> 01:11:41,647
If there at themselves, in Caucasus for everybody
he has a golden degree and all like that mûveltek.
Why?

898
01:11:41,682 --> 01:11:46,880
Just because of that vote in this manner, because unprecedented
onto the single Caucasus number of an evil deed,

899
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:49,123
if somebody raises a hand it idõsebbre.

900
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:53,367
Particularly then, if it illetõ called
into his own house, his own family.

901
01:11:53,402 --> 01:11:57,599
My friends, my friends, my friends.
But my lords

902
01:11:57,687 --> 01:12:01,452
Comrades I do not know it
na, let us come onto a man's manner, so help me God, na

903
01:12:01,487 --> 01:12:05,687
This already yet an.
Not bûnös, bûnös.
Let us come, onto a man's manner.

904
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:08,927
Let us all come everything elõröl,
let us vote for new one, calmness.

905
01:12:08,962 --> 01:12:11,077
Everything jegyzõkönyvezünk, that
let him be clear.

906
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,347
We start it, good? That vote?
With a show of hands?

907
01:12:13,382 --> 01:12:15,567
- Yes, let us come.
- Yes, with a hand.
- Then tessék.

908
01:12:15,602 --> 01:12:21,324
Who there is beside it, that the defendant not bûnös?

909
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:25,047
- An, kettõ
- What? How?
- Not bûnös.

910
01:12:25,082 --> 01:12:27,367
Let him be more attentive. Not bûnös.

911
01:12:27,402 --> 01:12:29,119
An, kettõ,

912
01:12:29,407 --> 01:12:30,907
three,

913
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:32,427
four,

914
01:12:32,927 --> 01:12:34,006
five.

915
01:12:34,007 --> 01:12:37,556
Who there is beside it, that the defendant bûnös?

916
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:42,758
An, kettõ, three, four, five, six.

917
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,427
Woe, seven.

918
01:12:46,327 --> 01:12:47,827
Seven beside it

919
01:12:47,887 --> 01:12:51,084
Five beside it, that not bûnös",
seven, that "bûnös".

920
01:14:52,927 --> 01:14:55,527
This will be here the this will be the borderline,
here, yes.

921
01:14:55,562 --> 01:14:58,963
We test everything with a word tükörszerûen
to develop.

922
01:14:59,007 --> 01:15:02,087
- Says it I am asking it, himself
- Yeah?
...ezt found out the whole one because of that,

923
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:04,847
that betûrõl-betûre let him recall it
the bygones?

924
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:07,247
Come on. Betûrõl-betûre.
How could he be?

925
01:15:07,282 --> 01:15:08,919
They are above each other.

926
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:13,722
We test it tükörszerûen to develop,
for the draft megfelelõen.
Much or little punctually.

927
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:18,407
Here let him keep silent, the old man, the lower neighbour
heard it, when the little boy it howled:
I will kill you!

928
01:15:18,442 --> 01:15:22,332
Heard the sound of the falling body next and
seeing, the little boy escapes.

929
01:15:22,367 --> 01:15:27,487
It is said, I am asking it, was from among themselves somebody
on the site of the murder?

930
01:15:27,522 --> 01:15:28,886
Of course not.

931
01:15:28,887 --> 01:15:33,358
It is known, I went there it elsõ negotiation
after a day. Myself caught it and I went there.

932
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,567
Because I wanted to look at it, what kind of house it,

933
01:15:36,602 --> 01:15:39,692
where the inhabitants stayed in only two flats there.

934
01:15:39,727 --> 01:15:44,127
The murder happens in one, the
the eyewitness of the murder lives in other one.

935
01:15:44,162 --> 01:15:45,526
- And nobody else.
- Na and what there is then?

936
01:15:45,527 --> 01:15:48,847
We this has something to do with our case?

937
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:52,824
The situation it, that beside the house
building operations leak.

938
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:56,767
A élite house is being built. Very many machines
gyûlt there together.

939
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,167
The building operations are continued day and night.

940
01:15:59,202 --> 01:16:00,732
So what? Day and night.

941
01:16:00,767 --> 01:16:05,636
With a word, it can be imagined how large a noise there is
on a building operation, which it is according to a word,
does he leak under their window?

942
01:16:05,767 --> 01:16:06,846
And why says all this?

943
01:16:06,847 --> 01:16:11,647
The old man claims that the boy heard it
his cry: I will kill you! and something heavy
the fall of a thing.

944
01:16:11,682 --> 01:16:15,927
And recognized the boy's sound resolutely
he said it in this manner in his testimony.

945
01:16:15,962 --> 01:16:17,462
Heard it, yes!
So what? What is there then?

946
01:16:17,647 --> 01:16:22,801
It is, that all of my respect the witness's,
but I cannot believe this.

947
01:16:23,007 --> 01:16:30,083
Let us wait for a moment, wants it with a word
to say that the old man is an oath on the court
, lied deliberately?

948
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:36,247
Communist, old school, neither word,
neither speech defamed it innocent
Chechen boy.

949
01:16:36,282 --> 01:16:40,877
You are a back if somebody lied under an oath
without it, then they dot the communists.

950
01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:44,920
They lied above and beneath, egytõl until one.

951
01:16:45,007 --> 01:16:48,587
It elõjogok for his mood, the mood of the power
you are only in that manner, from habit.

952
01:16:48,622 --> 01:16:52,167
I am asking it, we leave this now at least.

953
01:16:52,202 --> 01:16:54,252
They were all kinds of peoples.

954
01:16:54,287 --> 01:16:57,757
My father onto Területi Bizottság secret
he was Uralban.

955
01:16:57,847 --> 01:17:00,452
Mirõl themselves speak?
What kind of elõjogok?

956
01:17:00,487 --> 01:17:05,247
We did not see it until years at home. Fifty-year-old
onto his age his heart was used up.

957
01:17:05,282 --> 01:17:08,652
When it was pensioned off though,
he perished under three months.

958
01:17:08,687 --> 01:17:12,600
It was spat out, than an chewed
piece of paper! Mirõl they speak
What kind of elõjogok.

959
01:17:12,647 --> 01:17:15,241

1119
01:28:41,647 --> 01:28:44,320
From truth I deserved only a smile.

1120
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,722
Altogether one single smile.

1121
01:28:49,447 --> 01:28:53,042
When now here, that old man

1122
01:28:56,607 --> 01:28:59,917
I was left often alone in my childhood
with my ill grandma.

1123
01:29:02,967 --> 01:29:05,765
Five, you are six I may have been year
Yes, six.

1124
01:29:07,567 --> 01:29:10,923
Was badly only once, to die
started, I understood it immediately.

1125
01:29:12,887 --> 01:29:15,481
I tempted it the mentõt, but was nowhere.

1126
01:29:17,007 --> 01:29:18,520
The medicine,

1127
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:22,759
I am concerned about it awfully.

1128
01:29:24,447 --> 01:29:27,687
But I was sorry for it, since after all the
my grandma.

1129
01:29:27,722 --> 01:29:29,692
I believed it in that manner I cheer it up, to parody
I started ismerõsöket.

1130
01:29:29,727 --> 01:29:34,327
Szima old lady, Klavdija Petrovnát, the felsõ
neighbour, who the barátnõje was.

1131
01:29:34,362 --> 01:29:36,045
They were very amusing.

1132
01:29:36,407 --> 01:29:41,765
The grandma had big pains, but
I saw that he smiled.

1133
01:29:44,607 --> 01:29:49,556
Yet when it was taken away, dead, then
I saw the smile on his face.

1134
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:54,325
This all

1135
01:29:55,447 --> 01:29:56,960
laugh.

1136
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:01,165
and smile.

1137
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,085
This Chechen boy,

1138
01:30:12,247 --> 01:30:13,747
...az old man.

1139
01:30:17,127 --> 01:30:22,804
Now egyszerûen I feel it in my bones
the rémisztõ fear

1140
01:30:25,727 --> 01:30:27,365
and the solitude.

1141
01:30:27,407 --> 01:30:30,382
Likewise, than when with the grandma
I was left over.

1142
01:30:30,407 --> 01:30:31,907
With the dying man.

1143
01:30:35,407 --> 01:30:40,640
Back that only smile was this, that
from truth I deserved it.

1144
01:30:41,847 --> 01:30:43,519
Good, that there is a swear at least

1145
01:30:44,407 --> 01:30:45,907
I did not beat it up my back.

1146
01:31:19,287 --> 01:31:22,723
What an Russian story.

1147
01:31:27,927 --> 01:31:33,001
Yes. Here somehow generally on all of them
very Russian-like.

1148
01:31:33,207 --> 01:31:34,707
Not Harvard.

1149
01:31:35,007 --> 01:31:36,759
Not, it sure.

1150
01:31:39,367 --> 01:31:41,867
Upset it,?

1151
01:31:43,727 --> 01:31:46,087
Here let them keep silent, make yet an
experiment.

1152
01:31:46,122 --> 01:31:48,237
- What?
- Since themselves did one already.

1153
01:31:48,287 --> 01:31:51,723
Not, egyszerûen only ellenõrizni
I would like a thing.

1154
01:31:52,927 --> 01:31:54,519
Imagine only away

1155
01:31:55,887 --> 01:31:57,847

Well, I do not complain. His part for my trade.
Of course.

1158
01:32:03,447 --> 01:32:04,206
Well, yeah.

1159
01:32:04,207 --> 01:32:11,447
Imagine now away:

01:32:11,482 --> 01:32:12,366

1161
01:32:12,367 --> 01:32:13,686

01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:18,398

01:32:18,567 --> 01:32:21,525
- A what kind of car does he have?
- AUDI is 8.

1165
01:32:22,327 --> 01:32:26,206
Let him imagine it with a word:
Késõ returns home in the evening.

1166
01:32:26,247 --> 01:32:29,207
He lives on a good neighbourhood, in élite house.

1167
01:32:29,242 --> 01:32:30,206
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1168
01:32:30,207 --> 01:32:36,767
On all of them, is needed - doorkeeper,

1169
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:38,206
Barrier.
Safety õr.

Yes, Kolja, it õr.

True, really Koljának it is called.

1173
01:32:43,607 --> 01:32:46,132
Yes. The janitor, Petya is a uncle.

1174
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:47,847
- Valera is a uncle.
- Valera is a uncle.

1175
01:32:47,882 --> 01:32:49,492
Valerocska uncle, pleasant holidays.

1176
01:32:49,527 --> 01:32:54,087
Mindegyikõjüket you know it, everybody knows,

...hiszen this your house.

1178
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:58,292
This an very well õrzött house.

1179
01:32:58,327 --> 01:33:02,247
You, generally, on the usual place
you park your vehicle,

1180
01:33:02,282 --> 01:33:05,487
and suddenly, from the pole of your eye you notice it,
that there is not something properly.

1181
01:33:05,522 --> 01:33:06,566
What is there not?

1182
01:33:06,567 --> 01:33:08,205
There is light in the windows.

1183
01:33:08,727 --> 01:33:09,686
Light.

1184
01:33:09,687 --> 01:33:12,647
But back õk in this it idõben generally already
they sleep.

1185
01:33:12,682 --> 01:33:14,732
Why would they sleep? They wait for me, that

1186
01:33:14,767 --> 01:33:17,332
Of course, is in that manner, egyszerûen only
you returning home wanted to be being waited for.

1187
01:33:17,367 --> 01:33:21,767
But within, something in that direction forces, that
ask it: Valera uncle, in all order?

1188
01:33:21,802 --> 01:33:25,167
- Is Valera a uncle, everything properly?
- There are a yes, that of all reasons, everything properly.

1189
01:33:25,202 --> 01:33:28,727
You drive to the entrance, the doorkeeper,
Polja an old lady smiles.

1190
01:33:28,762 --> 01:33:30,121
- Good, good.

1191
01:33:30,122 --> 01:33:31,446
Not, pay attention to me.

1192
01:33:31,447 --> 01:33:33,372
You go to the elevator, the elevator - shhhs.

1193
01:33:33,407 --> 01:33:36,227
Elevator. You enter. Do you live on the 5. floor?

1194
01:33:36,262 --> 01:33:39,047
- That is right. How do you know?
- Wait.

1195
01:33:39,082 --> 01:33:42,005

It is the best floor. Is not neither too high,
neither too low and good the view.

1198
01:33:49,442 --> 01:33:51,892
You know?
They do not sleep because of something only.

1199
01:33:51,927 --> 01:33:56,687
They do not sleep for something. But immediately,
you find it out immediately, what kind of surprise
prepared for you.

1200
01:33:56,722 --> 01:34:00,172
It is 5. floor here.

Fifth is floor. And here the 5. floor.

Something was prepared for him.

I open the door.
I open the door.

1207

Wipe his foot.

1208
01:34:18,207 --> 01:34:19,707
Wiped?

1209
01:34:20,407 --> 01:34:22,332
- And there is silence!
- What?

1210
01:34:22,367 --> 01:34:26,807
The silence is big in the flat.
He is not silence like this.

1211
01:34:26,842 --> 01:34:30,327
And the light. The lights are on everywhere.

1212
01:34:30,362 --> 01:34:32,292
The things flung about.

1213
01:34:32,327 --> 01:34:34,892
Child slippers. One. His pair nowhere.

1214
01:34:34,927 --> 01:34:39,847
An big fürdõlepedõ, white törölközõ
on the floor of the corridor. You take everything already.

1215
01:34:39,882 --> 01:34:41,963
You summon it õket. They would answer only already.

1216
01:34:42,007 --> 01:34:44,852
I beg for it, let them answer only already!
But õk they keep silent.

1217
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:47,887
The telephone the safety õrökhöz it

1218
01:34:47,922 --> 01:34:50,184
- On the left side.
- Apology, gone astray. On the left side.

1219
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:53,433
The cable torn out, the handset
trampling on the floor.

1220
01:34:53,468 --> 01:34:56,647
You are reversed slowly, and
There he is!

1221
01:34:56,682 --> 01:34:57,726
- What?
- There!

1222
01:34:57,727 --> 01:34:59,452
- What?
- Pool of blood from under the door.

1223
01:34:59,487 --> 01:35:02,206
The door opens slowly.
Hangs down from the chandelier

1224
01:35:07,007 --> 01:35:08,086
a panda.

1225
01:35:08,087 --> 01:35:13,287
Panda. A huge plush panda. -
your little girl is his favourite game.

1226
01:35:13,322 --> 01:35:16,252
The blood though, - not too blood, but
wine poured out it shattered üvegbõl.

1227
01:35:16,287 --> 01:35:21,132
Is not yet on all of them disappearing, you run the
into net, and here Over.

1228
01:35:21,167 --> 01:35:26,047
The bedroom is your daughter on his doorstep.
Like that, as if would live, no blood.
It was strangled.

1229
01:35:26,082 --> 01:35:30,927
You open the bedroom, and there
the megerõszakolt and cut up
your wife!

1230
01:35:30,962 --> 01:35:31,846
This end.

1231
01:35:31,847 --> 01:35:35,387
You want to shout, but do not endure.
You want to run, but do not endure.

1232
01:35:35,422 --> 01:35:38,927
You stand only, than a pillar of salt,
above your wife's and your daughter's corpse.

1233
01:35:38,962 --> 01:35:41,852
Be waiting, be waiting, he does not come to an end with this yet!

1234
01:35:41,887 --> 01:35:44,452
Your lounge, somebody goes behind your back!

1235
01:35:44,487 --> 01:35:51,327
Who may it be? It though just it on the suckle,
who you want to save the börtöntõl.

1236
01:35:51,362 --> 01:35:53,092
Just with this knife.

1237
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:58,212
And õ translates onto a stomach slowly, skilfully
on the floor,

1238
01:35:58,247 --> 01:36:06,607
tightens your head and with this it sharp,
with a cold blade
fültõl to an ear kills it!

1239
01:36:11,487 --> 01:36:14,052

1240
01:36:14,087 --> 01:36:16,527
...a you will crawl in your own pool of blood,
- But I am asking it!

1241
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:17,966
You think about not having called the mum.

1242
01:36:17,967 --> 01:36:21,596
And you do not take it only yet, there döglõdve,
why he made this!

1243
01:36:22,087 --> 01:36:25,207
Made it because of that õ this, because we for them
only prey are!

1244
01:36:25,242 --> 01:36:27,562
We are not peoples! Prey!

1245
01:36:34,527 --> 01:36:37,678
I modify my decision
the killer - bûnös.

1246
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,444
A kid is good.

1247
01:36:49,167 --> 01:36:51,212
And your mum.

1248
01:36:51,247 --> 01:36:58,367
What raised a kid - clever, active,
is képzelõereje.

1249
01:36:58,402 --> 01:36:59,959
A man is true.

1250
01:37:06,247 --> 01:37:07,760
Back we are doing in this manner.

1251
01:37:08,887 --> 01:37:10,764
Six - six.

Why do they look at me now?

I donot know sensitive.

1255
01:38:18,967 --> 01:38:21,767
This man is badly.
Would it not be necessary to call here the court usher?

1256
01:38:21,802 --> 01:38:23,302
Let us listen to the doctor

1257
01:38:23,527 --> 01:38:29,841
Well, here this not food poisoning, that

1258
01:38:31,807 --> 01:38:37,359
This is on a neural basis. Water he needs him
to give, that

01:39:23,687 --> 01:39:26,838
- Apology, that
- I am well, I am well, I say thank you for it.

01:41:17,887 --> 01:41:21,132
Umarcsik. Umarcsik.

1281
01:41:21,167 --> 01:41:23,920
Na calm down, calm down.

1282
01:41:25,647 --> 01:41:27,147
It is gratitude for a god that I found you.

1283
01:41:27,847 --> 01:41:31,920
He will be in all order already now.
You will stay with me, in Moscow.

1284
01:41:53,807 --> 01:41:55,307
Let them not be afraid, I am it.

1285
01:41:56,167 --> 01:41:58,237
Oh, my God!

1286
01:41:59,367 --> 01:42:03,007
It is known, new here the lighting, the
an indicator board is old on the other hand.

1287
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:04,572
- Yeah.
- It is freezing now on the street outside.

1288
01:42:04,607 --> 01:42:06,247
Next so for a long time nobody to which accustomed was not got
to sit here.

1289
01:42:06,282 --> 01:42:08,358
- Back yes.
- He is not tough.

1290
01:42:08,487 --> 01:42:10,332
- I put this lamp here.
- Yeah.

1291
01:42:10,367 --> 01:42:13,462
- Let them not be worried, immediately
- Thank you.
- I find something out immediately.

1292
01:42:13,607 --> 01:42:15,107
Good.

1293
01:42:23,367 --> 01:42:25,492
- Na, tessék!
- What happened?

1294
01:42:25,527 --> 01:42:28,485
I believe it, now already everything clear.
His old title.

1295
01:42:29,087 --> 01:42:33,087
When he made a testimony on the court,
he granted a home address.

1296
01:42:33,122 --> 01:42:35,852
That is the title of that house, where the
a murder happened.

1297
01:42:35,887 --> 01:42:40,047
Now already, here on the court, an
he granted an other title.

1298
01:42:40,082 --> 01:42:41,246
His daughter's title.

1299
01:42:41,247 --> 01:42:43,636
Yes, said it.
Ow! Excuse me.

1300
01:42:44,247 --> 01:42:50,807
Said it, that after the murder with a day
traveled to his daughter, into Moscow's other end.

1301
01:42:50,842 --> 01:42:52,342
- Yes yes.
- He stayed there.

1302
01:42:52,367 --> 01:42:55,607
- And now there Most lives there?
- Is in that manner, is in that manner.

1303
01:42:55,642 --> 01:42:58,565
Said it, that onto his daughter's birthday
he traveled.

1304
01:42:58,927 --> 01:43:04,447
Yes! The escape of the murder and the neighbour
he happened in November.

1305
01:43:04,482 --> 01:43:05,982
Yes.

1306
01:43:06,047 --> 01:43:10,247
His daughter's birthday though
he is in a March.

1307
01:43:10,282 --> 01:43:12,064
Light, let him be kind.

1308
01:43:12,099 --> 01:43:14,070
Tessék, tessék.

1309
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:16,042
What does all this mean?

1310
01:43:16,647 --> 01:43:18,138
- Woe
- Light.

1311
01:43:18,139 --> 01:43:19,639
I explain it immediately.

1312
01:43:20,167 --> 01:43:24,647
I proposed to our court usher, that
let him dig elõ some information it
in connection with building operations,

1313
01:43:24,682 --> 01:43:26,182
what leaks beside the house.

1314
01:43:26,487 --> 01:43:31,277
Let me be believed it - this an huge
building operations, a new élite house are being built.

1315
01:43:31,447 --> 01:43:37,447
The square metre price -
at at least 4 thousand kezdõdik.

1316
01:43:37,482 --> 01:43:39,199
All are a flat sold.

1317
01:43:39,607 --> 01:43:47,560
On the place of that house though, where the
a murder happened, for this the cool expensive
one of his wings would stand for elite house.

1318
01:43:48,687 --> 01:43:51,527
It building határidõket punctually
it is necessary to keep it.

1319
01:43:51,562 --> 01:43:52,766
So what?

1320
01:43:52,767 --> 01:43:54,519
Now imagine only away:

1321
01:43:55,167 --> 01:43:58,876
It is necessary to hand over the house, where flat
you pay more million dollars.

1322
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:05,522
And something because of two of my bars, who do not ripen
an kopejkát neither, it is not possible to start it it
building operations.

1323
01:44:06,127 --> 01:44:08,407
The single magisterial house,
Catches it, I am asking it.

1324
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:09,486
...a in a city's centre.

1325
01:44:09,487 --> 01:44:14,047
The thrived an officer did not move out,
since it was his of service flat.

1326
01:44:14,082 --> 01:44:16,052
Nothing was his right onto him.

1327
01:44:16,087 --> 01:44:20,487
The military authority was not top notch to ensure
into an exchange any kind of other flat.

1328
01:44:20,522 --> 01:44:27,127
And the resolute former party worker, who
did not move out, because There it is!

1329
01:44:27,162 --> 01:44:30,563
...egyenértékû it required a flat new
because of power, likewise in the centre.

1330
01:44:31,127 --> 01:44:34,563
The cases like this are handled individualwise.

1331
01:44:35,007 --> 01:44:35,926
Thank you.

1332
01:44:35,927 --> 01:44:38,412
The jurists, immovable agents come

1333
01:44:38,447 --> 01:44:40,967
Or may enter sporting event themselves it is wanted.

1334
01:44:41,002 --> 01:44:44,332
Tersely, these egyszerûen robbers.

1335
01:44:44,367 --> 01:44:50,305
These peoples hit the soldier,
who battled against them,

1336
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:56,244
the was for a party worker, who did not understand it,
who were added to it.

1337
01:44:56,887 --> 01:45:00,766
And begins here an very much
szakszerû manõver.

1338
01:45:01,607 --> 01:45:03,996
Watch is set up.

1339
01:45:04,767 --> 01:45:06,723
The relations are found out.

1340
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:09,801
Who, how, who is in contact with.

1341
01:45:10,767 --> 01:45:12,280
The situation improves.

1342
01:45:12,927 --> 01:45:16,252
The final result: One - dead person,

1343
01:45:16,287 --> 01:45:21,600
the other, who naturally does not stitch
nobody, gets into a prison,

1344
01:45:22,407 --> 01:45:27,847
the third, escapes headlong
Into Moscow's suburb, to his daughter,

1345
01:45:27,882 --> 01:45:33,558
and registers inside some days
onto one to be stood to it.

1346
01:45:35,367 --> 01:45:40,043
This a yes szakszerû manõver.

1347
01:45:40,847 --> 01:45:46,877
So wants to say it, that this an
deliberate and elõre planned murder?

1348
01:45:48,727 --> 01:45:50,006
In that manner tûnik.

1349
01:45:50,007 --> 01:45:51,884
But back this szörnyû!

1350
01:45:55,767 --> 01:45:57,267
Back, knows it

1351
01:45:58,247 --> 01:46:01,842
when a million from dollars there is a word

1352
01:46:02,927 --> 01:46:08,559
the separating lane the "meggyõzni" and the
To kill between solutions

1353
01:46:09,967 --> 01:46:11,612
insignificant.

1354
01:46:11,647 --> 01:46:13,638
From where himself is top notch ezekrõl?

1355
01:46:21,727 --> 01:46:24,525
I asked it - from where is top notch ezekrõl?

1356
01:46:29,127 --> 01:46:30,627
It was told.

1357
01:46:32,207 --> 01:46:34,727
Hands over the candle, I am asking it.

1358
01:46:34,762 --> 01:46:36,445
Here, the candle.

1359
01:46:38,007 --> 01:46:46,244
Well told all this to us now,
And what there is now?

1360
01:46:47,247 --> 01:46:53,482
Meggyõzõdésem, that the little boy did not kill it
his stepfather.

1361
01:46:54,007 --> 01:46:57,556
Vote - not bûnös.

1362
01:46:59,247 --> 01:47:00,326
Oh, man!

1363
01:47:00,327 --> 01:47:01,840
Again, seven - five.

1364
01:47:05,047 --> 01:47:09,607
Apology, I accept it an so, quasi,
wild version lehetõségét,

1365
01:47:09,642 --> 01:47:14,132
but it was forgotten that he is yet an
eyewitness from the neighbouring house.

1366
01:47:14,167 --> 01:47:18,567
It õ his windows are in an eye punctually
with the windows of that room, where the
a murder happened.

1367
01:47:18,602 --> 01:47:22,719
Õ it declared, that with his own eye
seeing, the father

1368
01:47:23,207 --> 01:47:33,162
The father for something face the boy was struck by him,
snatched up the knife on the suckle though next and
sticked, directly into the officer's breast.

1369
01:47:34,007 --> 01:47:37,367
For him nothing his interest not fûzõdött to it,
that falsely bear witness.

1370
01:47:37,402 --> 01:47:39,524
It õ nobody wanted to break down his house.

1371
01:47:39,559 --> 01:47:41,612
That is, why not we would take it for him?

1372
01:47:41,647 --> 01:47:48,407
That woman, not only saw it, but yet
too showed it pricked, fentrõl downwards.

1373
01:47:48,442 --> 01:47:50,132
- Yes, showed it.
- That is right.
- Yes.

1374
01:47:50,167 --> 01:47:54,167
Mielõtt raise it would be medical science
fõiskolára, I worked as a nurse the
on accident surgery.

1375
01:47:54,202 --> 01:47:56,727
Much knife gallop like this I saw a wound.

1376
01:47:57,207 --> 01:48:03,487
How this boy was capable, who, it is known,
with at least a head lower at his father,

1377
01:48:03,522 --> 01:48:07,407
how knew it with a word fentrõl downwards
to prick with the knife?

1378
01:48:07,442 --> 01:48:09,398
We are in an Indian cinema possibly now,
or we?

1379
01:48:09,847 --> 01:48:12,759
Here let them keep silent, since this bosh!

1380
01:48:14,687 --> 01:48:20,087
But since bosh! Bosh!
What themselves wear here together?
What are dreamed up?

1381
01:48:20,122 --> 01:48:24,527
I cannot understand it Indian cinema
Since this bosh! Bosh.

1382
01:48:24,562 --> 01:48:27,652
How believes it I was not a bar
nurse on the accident surgery.

1383
01:48:27,687 --> 01:48:32,761
Let me show it how may be an with a head
to stab a lower man in a breast
fentrõl downwards?

1384
01:48:34,807 --> 01:48:36,525
We it, let me show it?

1385
01:48:37,327 --> 01:48:38,827
Let me show it?!

1386
01:48:41,767 --> 01:48:44,226
Let him show it if he knows it.

1387
01:48:44,261 --> 01:48:46,685
- Let me show it?
- Let him show it.

1388
01:48:46,967 --> 01:48:49,800
All right. Look!

1389
01:48:53,247 --> 01:48:54,275
No

1390
01:48:54,276 --> 01:48:55,776
Come here.

1391
01:48:56,687 --> 01:48:58,187
Come here.

1392
01:48:58,567 --> 01:49:01,127
I teach you immediately,
how he did it.

1393
01:49:01,647 --> 01:49:03,126
Come here.

1394
01:49:03,127 --> 01:49:04,627
In that manner.

1395
01:49:04,647 --> 01:49:06,147
No

1396
01:49:06,967 --> 01:49:08,467
Come here.

1397
01:49:09,007 --> 01:49:10,507
No.

1398
01:49:11,487 --> 01:49:12,987
How did it

1399
01:49:13,247 --> 01:49:14,566
Immediately.

1400
01:49:14,567 --> 01:49:15,486
Come here.

1401
01:49:15,487 --> 01:49:16,987
Immediately, immediately.

1402
01:49:17,447 --> 01:49:19,278
Immediately.

1403
01:49:23,367 --> 01:49:24,867
Come, come.

1404
01:49:24,887 --> 01:49:26,387
Come on.

1405
01:49:26,527 --> 01:49:28,027
Here.

1406
01:49:32,607 --> 01:49:33,926
Stop.

1407
01:49:33,927 --> 01:49:36,767
Now lower termetû am.
With a head.

1408
01:49:36,802 --> 01:49:37,966
Na, lower?

1409
01:49:37,967 --> 01:49:39,101
- Come back.
- Yes.

1410
01:49:39,102 --> 01:49:40,166
- Lower?
- Yes.

1411
01:49:40,167 --> 01:49:42,397
So I am lower with a head.

1412
01:49:43,847 --> 01:49:45,883
You say it - Indian cinema?

1413
01:49:47,687 --> 01:49:49,245
How was he able to make this?

1414
01:49:52,767 --> 01:49:54,267
I show it immediately.

1415
01:49:55,207 --> 01:49:58,118
I teach you, how knew this
to do.

1416
01:50:03,727 --> 01:50:05,763
Struck it õt. His father.

1417
01:50:09,847 --> 01:50:11,607
He humiliated it. He struck it!

1418
01:50:11,642 --> 01:50:13,142
It held the knife.

1419
01:50:28,087 --> 01:50:29,587
What was that?

1420
01:50:31,007 --> 01:50:33,202
It is blood?

1421
01:50:40,087 --> 01:50:41,587
Small bird.

1422
01:50:42,847 --> 01:50:44,347
Laid.

1423
01:50:46,367 --> 01:50:48,244
Does he allow it?

1424
01:50:50,967 --> 01:50:59,079
Knows it, the boy on country like that nõtt up,
where the essence of the knife is understood.

1425
01:51:03,087 --> 01:51:10,292
Anybody, for who he was at least one times already,
his alley to a knife, knows it, that with a knife from below
it is necessary to prick.

1426
01:51:10,327 --> 01:51:16,527
This always incalculable, always
dangerous and always heavy to prevent.

1427
01:51:16,562 --> 01:51:18,062
For example

1428
01:51:18,087 --> 01:51:19,587
Next into the neck!

1429
01:51:19,687 --> 01:51:21,598
- Onto a throat!
- What

1430
01:51:22,727 --> 01:51:28,127
Next to it, that let the knife reach it the
heart, the doctor szakértõk it is said,

1431
01:51:28,162 --> 01:51:33,527
an very much erõs it is necessary to make a hit,
that let him break through the chest.

1432
01:51:33,562 --> 01:51:34,726
For example

1433
01:51:34,727 --> 01:51:36,166
In this manner!

1434
01:51:36,167 --> 01:51:38,476
What is wrong with you?! Since, you

1435
01:51:39,087 --> 01:51:40,481
You you are a surgeon.

1436
01:51:40,482 --> 01:51:41,778
Surgeon, surgeon.

1437
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:43,006
Did you not notice it possibly?

1438
01:51:43,007 --> 01:51:49,847
Knife the knife, than any thrusting weapons,
particularly in Caucasus,

1439
01:51:49,882 --> 01:51:51,883
the culture is his part likewise.

1440
01:52:21,647 --> 01:52:23,603
Hûha! Yes!

1441
01:52:28,087 --> 01:52:31,363
Sorry. Ablabari I am a child.

1442
01:52:33,687 --> 01:52:35,187
Sorry.

1443
01:52:35,407 --> 01:52:36,907
Very interesting.

1444
01:52:40,327 --> 01:52:44,320
Then, I modify my decision.

1445
01:52:44,407 --> 01:52:46,921
God, went blind.

1446
01:53:08,207 --> 01:53:11,643
I cannot talk right now.
I cannot speak now, for you?

1447
01:53:12,967 --> 01:53:14,525
They hold a meeting yet.

1448
01:53:15,127 --> 01:53:16,719
Imagine it now.

1449
01:53:17,487 --> 01:53:19,532
Since a yes, a morning, imagine only away.

1450
01:53:19,567 --> 01:53:22,240
There were overzealous ones like this.
I am me maybe the wrong because of this?

1451
01:53:23,527 --> 01:53:25,995
Since the indicator board got ruined finally,
in this manner

1452
01:53:26,327 --> 01:53:30,847
This is everything, which I can recommend,.
It is this was left of the school discotheque here.

1453
01:53:30,882 --> 01:53:32,382
And the there is nothing?

1454
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:33,899
I take the lamp, it away.

1455
01:53:35,207 --> 01:53:37,652
They would have worked properly, already for a long time at home
could be,

1456
01:53:37,687 --> 01:53:40,807
and they would not jump about in the discotheque
until a morning, all neat men.

1457
01:53:40,842 --> 01:53:42,154
The pupils come soon

1458
01:53:42,155 --> 01:53:43,655
I suggest it, vote!

1459
01:53:45,447 --> 01:53:48,962
The architect there is absolute truth for a lord.
A system is very accurate.

1460
01:53:49,767 --> 01:53:52,467
I am beside it, that the kid
not bûnös.

1461
01:53:52,567 --> 01:53:57,721
Let him raise his hand, according to who the defendant
bûnös.

1462
01:53:59,767 --> 01:54:00,756
An,

1463
01:54:00,757 --> 01:54:02,006
kettõ,

1464
01:54:02,007 --> 01:54:03,507
three.

1465
01:54:06,007 --> 01:54:09,967
Let him raise his hand, according to who not bûnös.

1466
01:54:10,002 --> 01:54:16,156
An, kettõ, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

1467
01:54:18,127 --> 01:54:19,685
Apology, and you?

1468
01:54:21,247 --> 01:54:22,366
Sorry.

1469
01:54:22,367 --> 01:54:25,165
...És you?
- What?

1470
01:54:25,687 --> 01:54:27,678
- That votes?
- In a what kind of sense?

1471
01:54:28,247 --> 01:54:32,877
But a back said that he modifies it the
his opinion. For what?

1472
01:54:34,247 --> 01:54:35,760
Wait a minute.

1473
01:54:37,927 --> 01:54:43,047
Let him not be angry, I am asking it, does not remember it,
how did I vote it recently?

1474
01:54:43,727 --> 01:54:45,227
- Ja, when for himself
- Yes, yes, yes.

1475
01:54:45,847 --> 01:54:47,367
Was beside it, that bûnös.

1476
01:54:47,402 --> 01:54:48,925
I voted it in that manner "bûnös".

1477
01:54:49,367 --> 01:54:57,487
Yeah, I I modify it really the
my opinion and I vote for it, that the
defendant not bûnös.

1478
01:54:57,522 --> 01:55:00,980
Does not change his opinion already,
? May I write it down?

1479
01:55:01,015 --> 01:55:04,439
But back mirõl speaks. Come on.
This is my definitive decision.

1480
01:55:04,487 --> 01:55:06,132
It is conceptual question.

1481
01:55:06,167 --> 01:55:10,527
Dot because of the so conceptual peoples
one we will wake up to it in the morning,

1482
01:55:10,562 --> 01:55:16,047
that in our country Green Berets
order is done.

1483
01:55:16,082 --> 01:55:17,852
A foreign country speech is all around us.

1484
01:55:17,887 --> 01:55:21,972
I do not understand it, we his reason for this
for the reproach?

1485
01:55:22,007 --> 01:55:25,207
Himself changed its opinion,
just like I.

1486
01:55:25,242 --> 01:55:27,163
But not, my friend, not in that manner, than you.

1487
01:55:27,647 --> 01:55:31,407
This man just told a story now away an
perfectly clear scheme and it,
this mûködik.

1488
01:55:31,442 --> 01:55:33,932
But back this an unique bûnügyi special.

1489
01:55:33,967 --> 01:55:37,767
This not unique and not bûnügyi,
this scheme mûködik everywhere.

1490
01:55:37,802 --> 01:55:39,206
What kind is a scheme?

1491
01:55:39,207 --> 01:55:42,517
When the big ones do not think
onto the small ones

1492
01:55:43,687 --> 01:55:47,647
the small ones obliged to live in that manner,
they are top notch.

1493
01:55:47,682 --> 01:55:49,603
Own törvényeiktõl his guiding principle.

1494
01:55:50,727 --> 01:55:52,292
And this is in this manner everywhere.

1495
01:55:52,327 --> 01:55:56,607
On the building operations, in the hospital,
yet the temetõben too.

1496
01:55:56,642 --> 01:55:59,280
I do not understand it, how comes here the temetõ?

1497
01:56:00,047 --> 01:56:02,481
Himself buried already away somebody? Once?

1498
01:56:03,047 --> 01:56:04,547
That I?

1499
01:56:05,647 --> 01:56:07,147
I buried it.

1500
01:56:10,047 --> 01:56:14,047
With two years ezelõtt, in London.
Matilda.

1501
01:56:14,082 --> 01:56:15,582
Who is Õ?

1502
01:56:17,367 --> 01:56:18,867
Rottweiler.

1503
01:56:19,487 --> 01:56:22,732
This not surname, this an dog.

1504
01:56:22,767 --> 01:56:25,572
Well, I do not know it in London that
the dogs are buried,

1505
01:56:25,607 --> 01:56:29,395
I can talk about it only, how
the peoples are accompanied on the last journey at us.

1506
01:56:29,887 --> 01:56:32,287
I am eight of his year already headmaster an
temetõben.

1507
01:56:32,322 --> 01:56:34,652
Let it be imagined to be in front of themselves the következõ picture:

1508
01:56:34,687 --> 01:56:36,707
A close relative is buried.

1509
01:56:36,742 --> 01:56:38,692
Well, song, funeral ceremony, -
on all of them, is needed.

1510
01:56:38,727 --> 01:56:41,607
They arrive the temetõhöz, there the grave
in that manner that

1511
01:56:41,642 --> 01:56:44,687
What are you doing? What kind is a grave?
Believes this mum of mine.

1512
01:56:44,722 --> 01:56:45,486
Sorry.

1513
01:56:45,487 --> 01:56:47,045
This is my mum.

1514
01:56:49,247 --> 01:56:50,747
My mum.

1515
01:56:50,807 --> 01:56:53,012
Shortly, végsõ farewell, relatives

1516
01:56:53,047 --> 01:56:57,487
Some totally strange old lady, beside us,
looks into the grave and starts lamenting:

1517
01:56:57,522 --> 01:57:00,047
Oh, my God. How my poor little thing stains there
to lie?

1518
01:57:00,082 --> 01:57:01,924
The relatives - Mirõl there is a word? What happened?

1519
01:57:01,959 --> 01:57:03,767
They look into the grave, the water is a knee deep there.

1520
01:57:03,802 --> 01:57:05,302
Na, now we be?

1521
01:57:05,607 --> 01:57:06,766
We do?

1522
01:57:06,767 --> 01:57:09,361
An approximate man is not caught apparently
into the marsh to strangle.

1523
01:57:10,327 --> 01:57:12,522
The old lady into their ear whispers - gives advices.

1524
01:57:12,807 --> 01:57:15,932
The cryings start vezetõjéhez.
But õ is there beside them already.

1525
01:57:15,967 --> 01:57:19,562
It is said: Let him look at it, my respected lord,
the water is a knee deep there, it would be necessary to make something.

1526
01:57:20,967 --> 01:57:24,172
In this direction õ mumbles something the underground
vizekrõl,

1527
01:57:24,207 --> 01:57:29,207
with his shovel starts it to scoop the
from a grave the muddy water and jolts.

1528
01:57:29,242 --> 01:57:30,006
The relatives catch a shock.

1529
01:57:30,007 --> 01:57:34,444
During this the old lady catching somebody at his finger
yanks and shows it, direct beside it

1530
01:57:35,447 --> 01:57:38,837
With a word, a totally dry grave.
He dug freshly.

1531
01:57:39,567 --> 01:57:41,523
And comes now the most interesting.

1532
01:57:42,247 --> 01:57:46,647
The relatives turn to the gravedigger.
It is said: Let him be listening, could be
somehow

1533
01:57:46,682 --> 01:57:48,797
...szóval, to substitute?

1534
01:57:49,887 --> 01:57:54,244
That imagine, they lost its mind?!
Immediately, after 15 minutes bring for an
to bury a man!

1535
01:57:54,847 --> 01:57:57,583
How? May not be, -
the documents are ready already.

1536
01:57:57,807 --> 01:57:59,532
Õk they fall on a knee, they are wet with tears.

1537
01:57:59,567 --> 01:58:04,807
My respected lord, let him help already. We pay it.
Tells it how much.

1538
01:58:04,842 --> 01:58:08,322
Long already egyszerû -
it is surveyed külsõ on his basis.

1539
01:58:08,927 --> 01:58:11,077
Automatically - two green hasú"- t ask for.

1540
01:58:11,687 --> 01:58:13,166
Automatically - five hundred.

1541
01:58:13,167 --> 01:58:16,079
If the man penniless, into a word
they are doing with him.

1542
01:58:16,847 --> 01:58:21,487
And the method: The board is exchanged,
the thrives it is put into the dry grave,
the relatives, direction the thorax,

1543
01:58:21,522 --> 01:58:24,797
for the old lady though 500 into the pocket,
ruble naturally.

1544
01:58:25,567 --> 01:58:31,915
The foil covered early is dragged out
and the grave after 15 minutes dry.

1545
01:58:33,807 --> 01:58:37,720
Na, fighters, let us come new wet grave
to make.

1546
01:58:38,927 --> 01:58:40,427
This is going in this manner.

1547
01:58:51,687 --> 01:58:54,645
Good, that the mother-in-law in a crematorium
I had it cremated.

1548
01:58:58,927 --> 01:59:00,427
Very interesting.

1549
01:59:06,367 --> 01:59:08,164
Why do they look at me in this manner now?

1550
01:59:09,327 --> 01:59:10,827
Huh?

1551
01:59:11,127 --> 01:59:13,083
Is he some other way possibly at themselves?

1552
01:59:15,247 --> 01:59:16,747
Huh?

1553
01:59:17,007 --> 01:59:19,237
All of them we live encage. Everybody.

1554
01:59:20,087 --> 01:59:21,587
Only everybody the sajátjában.

1555
01:59:23,047 --> 01:59:24,560
Is in this manner, countryman?

1556
01:59:27,327 --> 01:59:29,045
Rolex?

1557
01:59:29,967 --> 01:59:31,467
Back yes.

1558
01:59:32,007 --> 01:59:33,507
Expensive?

1559
01:59:35,647 --> 01:59:36,766
Back yes.

1560
01:59:36,767 --> 01:59:38,439
Temetõi pénzbõl?

1561
01:59:41,687 --> 01:59:43,187
Temetõi pénzbõl.

1562
01:59:45,167 --> 01:59:48,159
Yes, temetõi pénzbõl. I take nothing away.

1563
01:59:49,087 --> 01:59:57,167
However ebbõl the pénzbõl yet the chapel
too I had it restored and I feed it steadily
the homeless.

1564
01:59:57,202 --> 01:59:59,920
Who the temetõhöz vetõdtek.
They have to devour it somewhere.

1565
02:00:01,687 --> 02:00:06,238
I had even a school built up in the village,
where felnõttem, 850 km because of Moscow.

1566
02:00:08,087 --> 02:00:14,481
Even the sports hall is there Jön
away to look at, so szörnyûség and horror
he is not there.

1567
02:00:14,727 --> 02:00:17,002
At me the csõ runs under the land, is needed.

1568
02:00:17,687 --> 02:00:21,963
Számítógépterem LCD with monitors.

1569
02:00:21,998 --> 02:00:26,239
Teachers from the city, all with good payment.

1570
02:00:26,807 --> 02:00:32,120
I started a bus, that the
gyerkõcöket brings it in the környékrõl it
into a school and of course back.

1571
02:00:32,407 --> 02:00:34,716
That let him not be their time to snuff.

1572
02:00:37,887 --> 02:00:40,037
And if the peoples are asked in this the
in a village:

1573
02:00:41,887 --> 02:00:45,402
Actually how pénzbõl too was being built
is it a school?

1574
02:00:47,847 --> 02:00:52,875
They spit on him, that how pénzbõl recovered
the school.

1575
02:00:54,167 --> 02:00:56,812
The essence it, that let the school be at a standstill
and mûködjön.

1576
02:00:56,847 --> 02:01:00,442
So that I help the dead persons' money
it élõknek.

1577
02:01:01,487 --> 02:01:03,364
If nobody else does this already.

1578
02:01:13,127 --> 02:01:15,004
The essence - on the suckle not bûnös.

1579
02:01:18,407 --> 02:01:25,367
After all, it is explained already for me, an
almost for a healthy man, that this it
egyszerû woman, for who

1580
02:01:25,402 --> 02:01:27,332
nothing his interest not fûzõdik to it

1581
02:01:27,367 --> 02:01:33,607
Why declared on the court it, that
it destroyed it with the knife on the suckle Vologyát,
the Russian position.

1582
02:01:33,642 --> 02:01:35,142
I know.

1583
02:01:35,807 --> 02:01:38,924
May shout at me, or may laugh at me.
But I know it.

1584
02:01:39,607 --> 02:01:42,167
- Jealousy.
- We, we?

1585
02:01:42,927 --> 02:01:44,427
A back knows it!

1586
02:01:44,647 --> 02:01:46,852
- It is
- This jealousy.

1587
02:01:46,887 --> 02:01:50,727
May not have heard it certainly, the boy it
shouted it: I will kill you!, what the opposite
he resides in house.

1588
02:01:50,762 --> 02:01:52,412
And may not have seen it.

1589
02:01:52,447 --> 02:01:55,017
Since lives opposite the house and
he was in the evening just then.

1590
02:01:55,167 --> 02:01:58,398
In the best case only shades
may have seen, bar it valószínû.

1591
02:01:59,087 --> 02:02:00,732
He did not see it.

1592
02:02:00,767 --> 02:02:05,012
Was sure that this was the boy
and nobody else.

1593
02:02:05,047 --> 02:02:10,207
Because he wanted it very much, and was ready in the boy
to see the worst one.

1594
02:02:10,242 --> 02:02:11,742
Why?

1595
02:02:12,927 --> 02:02:14,246
Jealousy.

1596
02:02:14,247 --> 02:02:18,972
Szörnyû, meaningless, feminine jealousy.

1597
02:02:19,007 --> 02:02:22,007
Is here, let these photographs be looked at.
Showed it on the court õket.

1598
02:02:22,042 --> 02:02:23,542
Here.

1599
02:02:23,647 --> 02:02:26,878
Onto understanding got it, how knew the victim.

1600
02:02:27,087 --> 02:02:29,927
There is a photograph here where they are together
on some feast.

1601
02:02:29,962 --> 02:02:33,252
Õ, it is victim and his wife.
Is it seen?

1602
02:02:33,287 --> 02:02:39,078
And this photo is here, Here.
...ahol the nõ, the man and somebody's hand.

1603
02:02:39,687 --> 02:02:41,372
This is the wife's hand.

1604
02:02:41,407 --> 02:02:48,167
What it was necessary to pick up and to enlarge
just that part, where only õ and it
victim shows.

1605
02:02:48,202 --> 02:02:49,702
Cut off the wife.

1606
02:02:51,047 --> 02:02:53,402
This photograph - it õ his dream.

1607
02:02:54,527 --> 02:02:57,932
If we carry on this theory,
takes shape an egyszerû picture.

1608
02:02:57,967 --> 02:03:04,047
Single nõ, who is an own normal family
he dreams about his formation. Childless.

1609
02:03:04,082 --> 02:03:08,127
Who likes the man from the opposite house.
There is only a trouble - the man nõs.

1610
02:03:08,162 --> 02:03:11,163
Writes a letter for him onto Csecsenföld, writes it,
that his wife cheats on it.

1611
02:03:11,198 --> 02:03:14,164
- Apology, I may look at it?
- Of course, tessék.

1612
02:03:14,687 --> 02:03:18,127
And, that is sorry for it very much, but not
may keep silent errõl.

1613
02:03:18,162 --> 02:03:21,756
Not to be top notch, it is you whether this was in this manner neither,
but fact, how sent a letter to him.

1614
02:03:22,367 --> 02:03:23,867
This is jealousy.

1615
02:03:24,087 --> 02:03:27,284
The nõ provoked it, that separate the
feleségétõl.

1616
02:03:27,687 --> 02:03:30,599
Clear. There are not more obstacles.

1617
02:03:30,647 --> 02:03:33,207
Only õ and the man, on this photograph.

1618
02:03:33,242 --> 02:03:35,767
It is necessary to wait it out only already while he recurs.

1619
02:03:36,047 --> 02:03:38,277
The beloved man's recurrence.

1620
02:03:39,127 --> 02:03:40,845
Arrives next, but not alone.

1621
02:03:41,967 --> 02:03:47,532
On a nerve, game, in Russian badly beszélõ,
dirty, hostile Asian kid.

1622
02:03:47,567 --> 02:03:52,846
They remember that he complained, when
asked the man, what plans
now to do?

1623
02:03:53,407 --> 02:03:59,367
Õ though egyszerûen answered it, that with this
will live with the boy in two one, törõdni wants
with his fate.

1624
02:03:59,402 --> 02:04:00,406
The end of everything!

1625
02:04:00,407 --> 02:04:02,167
All of his hopes - everything collapsed!

1626
02:04:02,202 --> 02:04:03,892
But õ does not give it up

1627
02:04:03,927 --> 02:04:08,887
Let them remember only told it that
invited the neighbour into company, the
together with a boy.

1628
02:04:08,922 --> 02:04:09,886
Onto a name-day.

1629
02:04:09,887 --> 02:04:13,482
Set, bought sweets,
some kind of book.

1630
02:04:14,327 --> 02:04:17,492
Noticed it suddenly next, that eltûnt
his money.

1631
02:04:17,527 --> 02:04:21,486
What lay beside that place,
where a poor boy was sitting.

1632
02:04:22,247 --> 02:04:25,444
And how rehearsed it meggyõzni õt, that
he gives back his money.

1633
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:27,972
Anyway the money késõbb elõkerült.

1634
02:04:28,007 --> 02:04:32,683
Õ himself related that he forgot it,
but somebody else sorted it out apparently.

1635
02:04:33,767 --> 02:04:40,367
But the nõ the seriously injured position
elõtt the money brought it up eltûnését.

1636
02:04:40,402 --> 02:04:44,997
Had to know it certainly on all of them, what stains
to happen. And this occurred of course.

1637
02:04:45,607 --> 02:04:49,725
The man hears it, that the boy, who õ
as his own son rears, thief!

1638
02:04:50,367 --> 02:04:52,835
In this direction õ lost his self-control apparently.

1639
02:04:53,007 --> 02:04:55,492
Face the little boy was struck by him, but the nõ only
he keeps silent.

1640
02:04:55,527 --> 02:05:02,247
When his nose started bleeding on the other hand,
the boy rose to his protection and said it, that
Not free, the boy not bûnös".

1641
02:05:02,282 --> 02:05:05,382
More punctually, that Ha wrong, not free
Vern.

1642
02:05:05,417 --> 02:05:08,483
Since õ weaker, child yet.
It is not allowed to hurt it.

1643
02:05:13,647 --> 02:05:15,160
Oh, my God.

1644
02:05:17,087 --> 02:05:20,172
The nõ did not lie, wanted it very much only.

1645
02:05:20,207 --> 02:05:27,602
He decided that the killer may be the boy only.
This is the little boy and nobody else.

1646
02:05:29,247 --> 02:05:30,885
Jealousy.

1647
02:05:32,287 --> 02:05:41,605
Meaningless, cruel, blind, vehement,
jealousy is feminine.

1648
02:05:45,167 --> 02:05:49,126
That is it.

1649
02:05:50,447 --> 02:05:54,359
Késõbb the money turned up.
This the nõ himself erõsítette.

1650
02:05:57,807 --> 02:06:03,279
I inhabit it with my son. Õ now 20 year, then
He was 1991,6.

1651
02:06:04,207 --> 02:06:07,563
My wife leafed on 90 of his ends

1652
02:06:09,687 --> 02:06:12,679
it escaped into states with somebody.
A back leafed if he leafed, francba with him.

1653
02:06:13,247 --> 02:06:15,492
The kid suffered of course, but I
I explained it to him,

1654
02:06:15,527 --> 02:06:21,847
that his mother egyszerûen off, long
idõre, and that will see it certainly yet.

1655
02:06:21,882 --> 02:06:24,361
My mother looked him after.

1656
02:06:24,927 --> 02:06:27,919
In it it idõben full erõvel taxiztam.

1657
02:06:31,167 --> 02:06:32,998
I did not think of the family somehow.

1658
02:06:34,367 --> 02:06:37,052
Fõleg, that the chicks did not report
problem, and

1659
02:06:37,087 --> 02:06:41,407
a chick sat down once, we talked,
we were warming to it

1660
02:06:41,442 --> 02:06:44,807
Was not a beauty
I fetched it several times the munkahelyérõl.

1661
02:06:44,842 --> 02:06:46,525
He moved to us next.

1662
02:06:47,727 --> 02:06:52,807
I was not waiting tõle a lot - be zaba,
let him do the laundry of us, let him take the kid into the school.

1663
02:06:52,842 --> 02:06:58,279
In that manner tûnt, õ too deals with him kindly.
Petted: Kolja-Nyikolasa.

1664
02:07:02,047 --> 02:07:05,959
If kill neither I remember him, that
kezdõdött this all.

1665
02:07:10,927 --> 02:07:14,307
All kinds started talking about my son.

1666
02:07:14,342 --> 02:07:17,687
So where did not make something,
where did trouble.

1667
02:07:17,722 --> 02:07:20,645
I beckoned to it and I asked: Was he in this manner?

1668
02:07:21,567 --> 02:07:26,880
Õ looks at me only, smiles and says it:
Was in this manner, father.
The garbage only bakes.

1669
02:07:27,367 --> 02:07:30,119
Back I punished it.

1670
02:07:31,127 --> 02:07:35,324
Once infuriated something,
I do not remember already, what it was

1671
02:07:35,427 --> 02:07:40,807
said something about him, that felbõszített.
Something tore in me
fog fell on my eye.

1672
02:07:40,842 --> 02:07:45,967
I burst in at night into the bedroom,
I pulled it off from the bed and with a fist,
with a fist for him

1673
02:07:46,002 --> 02:07:46,766
The nõ keeps silent only.

1674
02:07:46,767 --> 02:07:49,452
The kid's nose started bleeding suddenly next.

1675
02:07:49,487 --> 02:07:55,403
In this direction started yelling
Killer! Killer! What mûvelsz?!
You kill the child!

1676
02:07:56,607 --> 02:07:58,107
And said it only

1677
02:07:59,247 --> 02:08:01,747
I it is struck by me long

1678
02:08:02,487 --> 02:08:03,987
Sees blood - bellows.

1679
02:08:05,127 --> 02:08:08,487
All degenerated with a word, somehow.

1680
02:08:08,847 --> 02:08:12,283
The fiacskám, as if waited for it already somehow
would be this whole one.

1681
02:08:13,447 --> 02:08:17,167
He was not crying already. Flickers only steadily
and smiles.

1682
02:08:17,202 --> 02:08:19,532
Sûrûn winks, and what is the essence - is not crying.

1683
02:08:19,567 --> 02:08:26,678
He is not crying! I the face of a pitfall, it all blood,
õ flickers and smiles.

1684
02:08:27,887 --> 02:08:30,079
Flickers and smiles.

1685
02:08:34,407 --> 02:08:37,204
Once with some aroused night

1686
02:08:38,927 --> 02:08:44,567
My lounge, that the fürdõszobában the water flows,
I go in, I see it is washing it the lepedõjét.

1687
02:08:44,602 --> 02:08:47,764
In brief behugy urinated in his dream.

1688
02:08:48,567 --> 02:08:50,067
A boy child.

1689
02:08:50,187 --> 02:08:56,567
The lepedõt pressed it to his breast and the
he hid into a heel. Looks at me and smiles.
He smiles.

1690
02:08:56,602 --> 02:08:58,102
Flickers and smiles.

1691
02:09:00,127 --> 02:09:04,727
Behaves the way I go home as if
already from the beginning bûnös would be.

1692
02:09:04,762 --> 02:09:07,727
Is watching and that smile, like that
Is watching and

1693
02:09:07,762 --> 02:09:12,517
Apparently true is, but my soul on deep one's,
from within somehow

1694
02:09:14,847 --> 02:09:18,864
As if somebody for my own son's hangman
would have appointed.

1695
02:09:18,947 --> 02:09:21,427
And a child of his was then.
Likewise boy.

1696
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:23,572
Four may have been year possibly, when

1697
02:09:23,607 --> 02:09:28,247
once dot my eye elõtt made something
badness and I easily onto his bottom
I hit it.

1698
02:09:28,282 --> 02:09:29,932
And then knocked the crash!

1699
02:09:29,967 --> 02:09:36,361
The lord looked me after possibly! Slightly bent down,
in this manner the iron onto only a centimetre tõlem driven
into the wall.

1700
02:09:37,167 --> 02:09:38,667
That the

1701
02:09:40,407 --> 02:09:46,482
The sajátomat pitfall, but to his
I imply it, almost stitches.

1702
02:09:50,727 --> 02:09:56,562
Caught the small one then and they left
Tambovba to the relatives.

1703
02:10:00,007 --> 02:10:01,645
My night call was once

1704
02:10:02,847 --> 02:10:05,967
I took the road from home already, but something
he was heading back somehow.

1705
02:10:06,002 --> 02:10:07,964
As if they would have sticked to a neck only.

1706
02:10:07,999 --> 02:10:09,958
I am reversed - direction home.

1707
02:10:09,993 --> 02:10:11,918
I see it, there is light in the window.

1708
02:10:12,607 --> 02:10:16,447
I burst in into the flat, here and there, is nowhere.
3 clocks are nights.

1709
02:10:16,482 --> 02:10:18,597
My lounge - swishing in the cupboard.

1710
02:10:19,487 --> 02:10:25,596
I open the cupboard, õ is there,
in the cupboard, is sitting, smiles and looks at me.

1711
02:10:26,607 --> 02:10:30,247
And flickers only. Flickers, sûrûn flickers.

1712
02:10:30,282 --> 02:10:32,692
In this direction I ask what do: Are my small son, we with you?

1713
02:10:32,727 --> 02:10:36,612
I pulled it out the szekrénybõl, to myself
I hurried, õ snuggled up to me tightly,

1714
02:10:36,647 --> 02:10:41,516
looks at me, smiles, flickers, and the right
his back hides his hand behind it.

1715
02:10:41,967 --> 02:10:48,679
I ask it: My small son, we it there? and
I take his hand, his hand

1716
02:10:54,727 --> 02:10:56,683
He was a loop in him.

1717
02:11:00,167 --> 02:11:02,556
Loop the own övembõl.

1718
02:11:10,287 --> 02:11:19,558
I do not know it what showed on my face,
only caught, embraced, snuggled up to me

1719
02:11:20,167 --> 02:11:26,527
and said it whispering it:
Father, not, father. Father, not.

1720
02:11:26,562 --> 02:11:30,127
Not and repeated it without an end
Not, father, not.

1721
02:11:30,162 --> 02:11:34,643
And smiles, smiles.
Father, not.

1722
02:11:59,447 --> 02:12:03,076
With a word I in that manner vote, that

1723
02:12:03,527 --> 02:12:05,358
the kid not bûnös.

1724
02:12:06,287 --> 02:12:07,486
Let him note it.

1725
02:12:07,487 --> 02:12:13,835
A back knows it, this really very much meggyõzõ was.

1726
02:12:13,987 --> 02:12:16,812
I agree - the boy not bûnös.

1727
02:12:16,847 --> 02:12:18,972
- Vote.
- Is well, then vote.

1728
02:12:19,007 --> 02:12:22,682
Who votes for it, that the defendant not bûnös?
I ask for the hands to assume.

1729
02:12:23,527 --> 02:12:27,172
- Let him live, let him live. Made.
- Gratitude for a god made!

1730
02:12:27,207 --> 02:12:30,727
- That is it. Thank you.
- And his end.
- With a monotone decision.

1731
02:12:30,762 --> 02:12:31,921
- Let them be waiting, let them be waiting
- Thank you.

1732
02:12:31,922 --> 02:12:34,212
Let them be waiting, let me write it down.

1733
02:12:34,247 --> 02:12:38,847
- More, than seven clocks.
- Yes, I am asking it
- Let them be waiting, let them be waiting!

1734
02:12:38,882 --> 02:12:40,487
- What? What?
- Wait.

1735
02:12:40,522 --> 02:12:42,252
- What?
- Wait.

1736
02:12:42,287 --> 02:12:44,652
- What is there yet?
- I did not vote it yet.

1737
02:12:44,687 --> 02:12:47,647
- I hope for it himself joins us.
- Of course.

1738
02:12:47,682 --> 02:12:49,182
No.

1739
02:12:50,647 --> 02:12:55,292
I believe it in that manner, that bûnös.

1740
02:12:55,327 --> 02:12:59,167
Eleven innocent and an "bûnös".

1741
02:12:59,202 --> 02:13:03,007
- Back you next
- I explain it.
- Why

1742
02:13:03,042 --> 02:13:04,206
I explain it.

1743
02:13:04,207 --> 02:13:07,641
- The festõ was sitting only till now, because
- Very interesting.

1744
02:13:09,087 --> 02:13:10,767
- I explain it.
- I do not understand it

1745
02:13:10,802 --> 02:13:13,883
Back, is not what to do

1746
02:13:19,207 --> 02:13:23,519
It, that õ innocent, kezdettõl caught
I was top notch.

1747
02:13:25,687 --> 02:13:27,757
From my trade adódóan this egyszerû.

1748
02:13:28,407 --> 02:13:31,346
I agree with all arguments, that here
he was over.

1749
02:13:31,381 --> 02:13:34,285
And the old man was scared really, this showed.

1750
02:13:34,807 --> 02:13:38,686
And now the nõ. It was forgotten, that
myopic, wears glasses.

1751
02:13:38,887 --> 02:13:42,092
Megerõsítette, that slept already, when
the thing happened.

1752
02:13:42,127 --> 02:13:45,767
To it, that let him see everything, up was needed
to get up, had to put on the glasses and
to go to the window.

1753
02:13:45,802 --> 02:13:47,452
This egyszerûen valószínûtlen.

1754
02:13:47,487 --> 02:13:52,167
What the boy deserves
It is known well, that õ Caucasus and, that õk
entirely some other kind of peoples.

1755
02:13:52,202 --> 02:13:55,824
I was ordered repeatedly into Caucasus
and I know these peoples.

1756
02:13:55,859 --> 02:13:59,412
Will never shout it, that
I destroy you, but catches it and destroys it.

1757
02:13:59,447 --> 02:14:04,767
And will not guess all kinds of bosh,
õ finds something in which nobody hits home out
mistake.

1758
02:14:04,802 --> 02:14:06,006
The others are obvious though.

1759
02:14:06,007 --> 02:14:09,092
Obvious, that all of this all thing
arranged.

1760
02:14:09,127 --> 02:14:13,847
Those peoples directed it in this manner, for who
was very important, that the boy in a prison
let him be sitting.

1761
02:14:13,882 --> 02:14:16,292
Is that right? We understood this.

1762
02:14:16,327 --> 02:14:19,127
We proved it, that not bûnös.
Right?

1763
02:14:19,162 --> 02:14:21,163
But, if this is in this manner, then

1764
02:14:23,447 --> 02:14:27,301
we come to this decision and õt freely
it is allowed.

1765
02:14:27,336 --> 02:14:31,155
- Back sure! Of course.
- Nagyszerû.
- And gratitude for a god.

1766
02:14:32,287 --> 02:14:34,812
Yes, gratitude for a god, that not killer,
this is true.

1767
02:14:34,847 --> 02:14:39,927
But then why votes in that manner, that
bûnös?

1768
02:14:39,962 --> 02:14:42,207
I egyszerûen they is worthless.

1769
02:14:42,242 --> 02:14:44,092
I do not take it finally already now.

1770
02:14:44,127 --> 02:14:48,447
How when finally himself
They is worthless altogether already!

1771
02:14:48,482 --> 02:14:50,967
It is known, on this already all of them too are!

1772
02:14:51,002 --> 02:14:52,126
I am here for example was like this!

1773
02:14:52,127 --> 02:14:56,127
And when when already everybody
Then himself De back we this?!

1774
02:14:56,162 --> 02:15:00,127
Exactly. Huge, sweaty, heavy
we made work.

1775
02:15:00,162 --> 02:15:02,572
We found out the truth! Himself

1776
02:15:02,607 --> 02:15:09,407
I may claim one surely, in the prison
will live long, than freely.

1777
02:15:09,442 --> 02:15:10,942
Very interesting.

1778
02:15:11,327 --> 02:15:16,767
Let it be understood, if õ is about the street now,
will not go into the pub, you are a homeland,
to the relatives.

1779
02:15:16,802 --> 02:15:19,144
There are nothing and nobody.
Is it understood?

1780
02:15:19,179 --> 02:15:21,452
Is going and looks those who destroyed it up
his father.

1781
02:15:21,487 --> 02:15:25,132
Besides, if we now felmentõ judgement
bring for,

1782
02:15:25,167 --> 02:15:30,092
with this egyidõben automatically new procedure
he runs in the case of the unexplored murder.

1783
02:15:30,127 --> 02:15:36,607
And the peoples who killed his father,
they will be nervous and the boy will be looked for.

1784
02:15:36,642 --> 02:15:40,052
Õ will be looking for it õket, õk it will be being looked for õt.

1785
02:15:40,087 --> 02:15:44,877
But õ does not know it, that õk where they are,
õk it is known on the other hand, where is õ.

1786
02:15:45,327 --> 02:15:50,567
We though with our current decision, instead of it,
that into a prison we would send the boy,

1787
02:15:50,602 --> 02:15:53,292
we sign his death sentence.

1788
02:15:53,327 --> 02:16:00,252
It will be destroyed, stupidly, terribly,
than a dog in the doorway an dikics
with a knife.

1789
02:16:00,287 --> 02:16:04,047
Nobody will look for this boy.
Themselves know this well.

1790
02:16:04,082 --> 02:16:05,582
Then with 8 months késõbb it is found

1791
02:16:05,607 --> 02:16:09,892
somewhere in a channel, or an
in a cesspit, and ready.

1792
02:16:09,927 --> 02:16:17,117
Let it be understood, in the hall now peoples like that
who accompany it with attention are sitting how
végzõdik this lawsuit.

1793
02:16:17,927 --> 02:16:22,247
I have a good nose to this. I feel it.
This is a vocational instinct.

1794
02:16:22,282 --> 02:16:25,247
- Is it understood?
- Mûvészi instinct, true?

1795
02:16:25,282 --> 02:16:27,203
- What?
- Mûvészi is an instinct.

1796
02:16:28,247 --> 02:16:29,366
Mûvészi.

1797
02:16:29,367 --> 02:16:32,567
- And if there, in the prison
- Onto the god's love!

1798
02:16:32,602 --> 02:16:34,846
...felakasztja himself?
- Let him not point himself out.

1799
02:16:34,847 --> 02:16:37,687
From where we know it what may happen to him there?

1800
02:16:37,722 --> 02:16:39,723
How will behave - from where we know it?

1801
02:16:44,527 --> 02:16:47,343
Then, this it õ his fate

1802
02:16:48,847 --> 02:16:50,758
if hangs himself there.

1803
02:16:52,447 --> 02:16:59,327
But I claim one certainly - in the prison
will live long, than freely.

1804
02:16:59,362 --> 02:17:03,332
Na is well, but what suggests then
in this case?

1805
02:17:03,367 --> 02:17:09,047
Suggests it, that an innocent man
let him sit in a prison, the bûnözõk though
let them be left freely?

1806
02:17:09,082 --> 02:17:10,378
- Yes.
- Back this it.

1807
02:17:10,379 --> 02:17:11,606
I did not suggest one like this.

1808
02:17:11,607 --> 02:17:15,887
If we conceal the boy in the prison
Is not where to do.

1809
02:17:15,922 --> 02:17:19,004
He does not have a home - it was broken down.
Is not where to live.

1810
02:17:19,927 --> 02:17:23,237
We hire lawyers, gyûjtünk onto him
money, I believe it.

1811
02:17:23,367 --> 02:17:28,887
We go away onto the public prosecutor's department, we look it up
the leghozzáértõbbeket and we tell it to them
our arguments.

1812
02:17:28,922 --> 02:17:31,732
Those peoples press it to a wall then
these killers.

1813
02:17:31,767 --> 02:17:35,892
And when they will be in the prison already,
it is possible to let out the boy.

1814
02:17:35,927 --> 02:17:38,772
He will be securely outside already then.
At least in this look.

1815
02:17:38,807 --> 02:17:46,407
Apology, it is sold already away, these lawyers,
these the hozzáértõ peoples, this public prosecutor's department,
this

1816
02:17:46,442 --> 02:17:48,796
Who will deal with this?
This interests me.

1817
02:17:52,607 --> 02:17:55,052
- Who
- Whether who?

1818
02:17:55,087 --> 02:17:56,884
Back we ourselves! Who else?

1819
02:17:57,487 --> 02:17:58,987
What?

1820
02:17:59,327 --> 02:18:06,244
Back who needs this the penniless,
in Russian beszélõ onto a Chechen boy,

1821
02:18:07,167 --> 02:18:10,012
who the nevelõapja with murdering him accuse?

1822
02:18:10,047 --> 02:18:13,722
Who will deal with him? Who are more important to
õ, if not for us? Who?

1823
02:18:32,167 --> 02:18:36,843
I am a cab driver, not investigating.
I have to drive it

1824
02:18:37,247 --> 02:18:39,238
I understand it, of course, but

1825
02:18:41,407 --> 02:18:42,907
I donot know.

1826
02:18:45,727 --> 02:18:53,407
I do not know it, they were my contacts it
at a public prosecutor's department, but for this already a hundred of his years,
it is my father on his time yet.

1827
02:18:54,407 --> 02:18:57,087
For me for example onto a half-year into Japan is needed
to travel.

1828
02:18:57,122 --> 02:18:58,852
This is a very complicated work.

1829
02:18:58,887 --> 02:19:04,087
Let it be understood, not only from me there is a word.
I am responsible for 850 workers yet and the
for their family.

1830
02:19:04,122 --> 02:19:07,238
But back, that imagine this?
Let me work in that manner there,

1831
02:19:07,527 --> 02:19:12,123
that I know it meanwhile, an innocent man is sitting
in the prison, who does not know it, what do?

1832
02:19:20,367 --> 02:19:25,157
Na, pél for example for me the jövõ on seven
four mûtétem is.

1833
02:19:25,807 --> 02:19:30,012
On 21, 23 and 24 immediately kettõ.

1834
02:19:30,047 --> 02:19:33,647
What I should make now, let me cancel all of them?
But back that? How I could make it?!

1835
02:19:33,682 --> 02:19:37,172
Is well, my lords, let us put it up, quasi

1836
02:19:37,207 --> 02:19:42,612
On a totally theoretical basis, let us put it up, that
I would be able to deal with him, but how?

1837
02:19:42,647 --> 02:19:48,007
Is needed sincerely very much with this
to deal, to this much idõ necessary.

1838
02:19:48,042 --> 02:19:52,607
A reality show just starts now at me,
I am there day and night.

1839
02:19:52,642 --> 02:19:56,156
That title of the show: The planet of a good turn.
It is

1840
02:19:56,687 --> 02:19:58,837
Totally clear, everybody would be top notch, but when?

1841
02:19:59,567 --> 02:20:04,687
Three are monthly guest performances on Volga River.
This much, I was late in this manner already, needs
to ripen the team.

1842
02:20:04,722 --> 02:20:07,732
Let them listen, kind!

1843
02:20:07,767 --> 02:20:12,487
We executed a big thing!
We set an innocent man free!

1844
02:20:12,522 --> 02:20:14,984
An, anyway for us strange man.

1845
02:20:15,019 --> 02:20:17,773
- Doubtless.
- We accomplished the jurors' duties!

1846
02:20:17,808 --> 02:20:20,527
The others - already other power organs' thing.

1847
02:20:20,562 --> 02:20:23,204
Rather already ebbõl the fejetlenségbõl.

1848
02:20:23,239 --> 02:20:25,812
Since exists, végülis, the law!

1849
02:20:25,847 --> 02:20:28,680
What is there with themselves? Their E flat are
altogether, we?!

1850
02:20:29,047 --> 02:20:32,323
Segítõ-úttörõk, how it is believed,
do they want to stick to a TA here until a morning?

1851
02:20:32,487 --> 02:20:34,612
What there is with themselves, let them come to their senses already!

1852
02:20:34,647 --> 02:20:38,447
A clock falls after forty minutes the
my machine Seremetyevo-ra.

1853
02:20:38,482 --> 02:20:41,892
Arrives now Dubai-ból my darling.
Julecska.

1854
02:20:41,927 --> 02:20:45,476
21 are year. Two of his months I did not see.
Does my life want to be ruined?

1855
02:20:46,327 --> 02:20:47,827
They lost its mind, or we?

1856
02:20:47,847 --> 02:20:51,447
I started going regularly to fitness, than an
old idiotic.

1857
02:20:51,482 --> 02:20:53,784
Three and a half are the sizes of his melons.

1858
02:20:53,819 --> 02:20:56,087
Two of his months I did not see õt.
Two are his months!

1859
02:20:56,122 --> 02:20:58,203
I was amorous, possibly elõször!

1860
02:20:58,247 --> 02:21:02,847
1.83 are tall. His buds are chocs like this.
Like this, ni!

1861
02:21:02,882 --> 02:21:05,486
His lips, than Angelina Jolie-é,
his eye is green.

1862
02:21:07,007 --> 02:21:11,125
The fenekérõl I cannot speak
it is a commissioner because he holds out.

1863
02:21:11,687 --> 02:21:14,759
All guffaws temetõ! Yet poems
too I started writing on my workplace.

1864
02:21:15,727 --> 02:21:18,480
Julia you kind, you sweet.
Throw the chains of the sense of shame down.

1865
02:21:18,547 --> 02:21:21,527
I find everything in you only.
The day, the levegõt

1866
02:21:21,562 --> 02:21:23,245
- Water.
- And the water.

1867
02:21:25,047 --> 02:21:27,043
It is necessary to tear it off half-hourly.

1868
02:21:27,078 --> 02:21:29,039
For what did I have to go away onto this fitness?

1869
02:21:29,207 --> 02:21:33,086
21 are year! I cannot sleep calmly,
do you understand it?

1870
02:21:33,127 --> 02:21:34,719
His third day I have an ejaculation.

1871
02:21:35,327 --> 02:21:38,637
Than an for fifteen year kids!
When was your ejaculation last?

1872
02:21:38,967 --> 02:21:43,006
Television. You know?
We with this the gyûléssel, vazze!

1873
02:21:43,047 --> 02:21:44,326
Let us come, let us do something already.

1874
02:21:44,327 --> 02:21:46,207
- Let's go.
- Relax.
- Donot touch me!

1875
02:21:46,242 --> 02:21:47,852
Let us come something let us decide already,
my lord is respected.

1876
02:21:47,887 --> 02:21:50,447
- Let him drink
- Drink it, you may eat the glass.
Do not touch me.

1877
02:21:50,807 --> 02:21:52,307
Let us come, let us do something.

1878
02:21:55,247 --> 02:21:57,522
Mitõl he has merriment like this?

1879
02:22:00,847 --> 02:22:02,246
That pipe, sees it?

1880
02:22:02,247 --> 02:22:04,647
- How comes here the csõ?
- But not, na, sees it?

1881
02:22:04,682 --> 02:22:06,964
- How many of his years are already here?
- Forty.

1882
02:22:06,999 --> 02:22:09,247
- And till when will be yet?
- So much.

1883
02:22:09,282 --> 02:22:10,086
So much.

1884
02:22:10,087 --> 02:22:14,000
- So what? What we?
- Everything is going in this manner.

1885
02:22:14,127 --> 02:22:15,692
Everything.

1886
02:22:15,727 --> 02:22:22,447
It was looked at, it was discussed, you contemplate,
they gave a dismissive wave of the hand, they lighted up and this much.

1887
02:22:22,482 --> 02:22:23,982
And everything is going in this manner.

1888
02:22:43,047 --> 02:22:48,012
A proposal of mine is shortly, for me.
We do it righteously, felnõttek onto his manner.

1889
02:22:48,047 --> 02:22:55,687
If now, despite my arguments,
everybody in that manner votes, that the boy innocent,

1890
02:22:55,722 --> 02:22:57,222
I join.

1891
02:22:57,367 --> 02:22:58,867
Will he be properly in this manner?

1892
02:22:59,327 --> 02:23:00,827
Stop.

1893
02:23:01,247 --> 02:23:02,747
Stop.

1894
02:23:04,607 --> 02:23:10,603
Himself is sure that he elects it,
if we all of them

1895
02:23:13,087 --> 02:23:14,587
I gave my word.

1896
02:23:15,127 --> 02:23:18,199
Na, knows it, an festõ his word

1897
02:23:19,447 --> 02:23:25,795
Is well, if does not like the festõ his word,
I give the word of a position then.

1898
02:23:27,367 --> 02:23:29,278
Visible a volt of his position.

1899
02:23:33,727 --> 02:23:36,287
A volt of his Russian position

1900
02:24:01,047 --> 02:24:02,246
Vote.

1901
02:24:02,247 --> 02:24:07,446
Who there is beside it, that the boy not bûnös?
I ask for the hands to assume.

1902
02:24:12,847 --> 02:24:14,803
- Do we vote for the innocent one?
- Yes.

1903
02:24:21,527 --> 02:24:27,397
1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10,11.

1904
02:24:33,047 --> 02:24:34,547
Tizenkettõ.

1905
02:24:55,567 --> 02:24:57,067
Innocent.

1906
02:25:15,087 --> 02:25:17,078
This is the best place after all.

1907
02:25:18,167 --> 02:25:20,442
Not, the end of the case is not yet.
Then késõbb we speak.

1908
02:25:25,327 --> 02:25:27,716
Do not start without me.
Being audible, mother

1909
02:25:43,071 --> 02:25:45,825
Would you recognize those who they were in the flat?

1910
02:25:45,926 --> 02:25:48,826
Of course, I never forget it õket.

1911
02:26:04,967 --> 02:26:08,727
We find it õket.
We find it anyway.

1912
02:26:08,762 --> 02:26:10,262
I promise it to you.

1913
02:26:11,462 --> 02:26:13,162
How was your father called?

1914
02:26:13,847 --> 02:26:15,347
Ruszlan.

1915
02:26:18,527 --> 02:26:20,882
- And the nevelõapádat?
- Vologya is a uncle.

1916
02:26:24,856 --> 02:26:26,356
I am called Nyikolaj.

1917
02:26:28,247 --> 02:26:29,760
May call in Nyikolaj for a uncle.

1918
02:26:32,007 --> 02:26:33,507
If you want.

1919
02:26:36,607 --> 02:26:39,647
You will stay with me.
Let's get out of here.

1920
02:26:39,682 --> 02:26:41,182
Let us be going, let us be going.

1921
02:28:48,207 --> 02:28:54,680
With a word: If you want to fly - fly,

1922
02:28:55,727 --> 02:28:57,046
a fly is free.

1923
02:28:57,047 --> 02:28:58,878
If you want to be left over - be left over.

1924
02:28:59,727 --> 02:29:03,356
The essence that you yourself should decide.

1925
02:29:05,567 --> 02:29:07,762
Nobody does this instead of you.

1926
02:29:11,847 --> 02:29:13,847
He was my fortune!

1927
02:30:22,611 --> 02:30:33,611
The law above everything, but we be, if
the mercy on a law proves
