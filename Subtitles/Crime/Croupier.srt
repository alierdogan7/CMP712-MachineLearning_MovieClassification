1
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,478
(Man) 'Now he had become

2
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,315
'the still centre of that
spinning wheel of misfortune.

3
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,428
'The world turned round him,
leaving him miraculously untouched.

4
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,672
'The croupier had reached his goal.

5
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,513
'He no longer heard
the sound of the ball.'

6
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,670
(Thunderbolt)

7
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,469
'To begin with, he was Jack Manfred.'

8
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,120
- Now, then.
- I want a job, Giles.

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,760
I see. Well...

10
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,479
let me tell you
a little about our operation.

11
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,348
We like personality authors.
People the public recognises.

12
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,192
Celebrity's what sells books.

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,953
You can always find somebody
to do the writing.

14
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,316
What we need is the face.
Then the concept.

15
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,915
Right now I'm looking
for a soccer novel.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,597
Something where a tycoon buys a
lousy team, takes it to the top.

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,877
Seven-figure transfer fees.
Corruption all down the line.

18
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,269
Violence on and off the pitch.

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,713
Steroids.

20
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,794
You got any concepts?

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,189
It could be a thug story.

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,112
I'll tell you what,
why don't you think about it?

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,191
Couple of pages.

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,632
With plenty of sex, of course.

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,119
Fiona!

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,670
Interesting, Giles.
I will think about it.

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,153
Let me give you
three words of advice, Jack.

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,596
Don't give up. Stick with it.

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,752
Who persists, wins. That's my motto.

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,796
Write, write, write.

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,917
'And Jack had three words for Giles.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,638
'Go fuck yourself.

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,152
'Jack knew something was wrong.

34
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,791
'He'd forgotten Giles' advice,
Giles said three words.'

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,913
(Phone)

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,479
(Answerphone clicks on)

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,711
(Jack) 'Nobody around.
Leave a message after the beep.'

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,153
(Beep)

39
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,992
(Man) 'Jacko,
if you're there, pick up.

40
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,435
'I want to talk to you.
It's important.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,995
'Jacko,
I've got some news for you.

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,674
'Come on, Jacko.'

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,593
- Yeah, Dad, it's me.
- 'How's it going? '

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,875
- Good, yeah.
- 'Found a job yet? '

45
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,390
- No.
- 'I've got something for you.'

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,674
In London.

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,796
I've been chatting with some friends.

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,348
Now, do you know
the Golden Lion casino?

49
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,192
'They're looking for a dealer.'

50
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,919
Yeah, that's not
what I wanna do, Dad.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,468
I know you don't like
taking my advice...

52
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,278
No, it's not that.

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,590
'Listen, I've set this up for you.'

54
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,878
You call the Golden Lion
and ask to speak to Mr Reynolds.

55
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,518
That's the manager.

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,876
I don't know him personally
but I have spoken to his boss.

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,192
'Now, don't say no, Jacko.
Give yourself a break.'

58
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,714
All right, Dad.
Yeah, I'll think about it.

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,950
Reynolds at the Golden Lion.

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,793
Yeah. All right, Dad.
Yes. I'll call him.

61
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,394
'You do that. That's my boy.'

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,277
So how are you doing, Dad?

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,715
Great. Just started a new company.

64
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,153
(Fruit machines beeping)

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,356
Solid financing. It's good.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,798
'Jacko,
you know I love you, don't you? '

67
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,351
- Yeah. I know that.
- 'Don't let yourself down.'

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,831
- I won't.
- 'I'll keep in touch.'

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,353
(Dialling tone)

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,078
Goodbye, Dad.

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,677
(Bird squawks)

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,752
(Woman) It was unbelievable.
I was in the room.

73
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,552
500.

74
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,029
Uh-huh. Blackjack.

75
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,116
See you then, bye.

76
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,033
Sorry to have kept you.
What'll you have?

77
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,430
'No. Jack knew
it still wasn't quite right.'

78
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,993
(Taps keyboard)

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,992
(Man bawling outside)

80
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,595
(Man) I wanna fuck
the whole world over!

81
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,908
Ha!

82
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,753
(Can clatters down stairs)

83
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,274
'He had just one word for Giles.'

84
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,313
(Buzzer)

85
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,755
(Scottish accent)
David Reynolds. The manager.

86
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,070
- Sit down, John.
- Jack.

87
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,557
You've been recommended
by the management here.

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,710
They knew your father.

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,916
He's a bit of a reputation,
hasn't he?

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,639
- Has he?
- In any case, I understand

91
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,598
you've had previous experience
in South Africa.

92
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,116
You'll find the rules here
a little different.

93
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,430
Before we start,
have got a police record?

94
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,512
- No.
- What school did you go to?

95
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,636
- I was at Bedales.
- Oh.

96
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,032
I don't think I know that one.
Private, I suppose.

97
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,588
There's three types of casino
in the UK.

98
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,240
High volume, small action
and middle of the road.

99
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,799
That's us. OK, Charlie.

100
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,836
- Do you have a salon prive?
- We tried.

101
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,230
Wasn't enough business.
Punters like company.

102
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,959
'Welcome back, Jack.

103
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,837
'To the house of addiction.'

104
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,475
Thanks, Charlie.

105
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,510
Right. Let's see you
handle the chips.

106
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,717
I assume the serial numbers on
the bowl and wheel correspond.

107
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,236
- We check every two days.
- Why not every day?

108
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,151
Procedure here.

109
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,077
Right, sort the chips.

110
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,835
Go.

111
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,150
(Watch ticking)

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,994
Good.

113
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,391
Right. Now pay me out 1800 in 25s.

114
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,315
Very good.

115
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,233
OK. Let's have a look
at your Blackjack.

116
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,318
14. Too many.

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,033
19, 16.

118
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,235
Too many.

119
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,793
13.

120
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,995
18,14.

121
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,674
19. 20.

122
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,395
(Deals)

123
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,475
What's the count?

124
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,357
Minus nine.

125
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,839
I make it minus eight.

126
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,399
Minus nine.

127
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,754
What makes you so sure?

128
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,319
It's the rule.

129
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,118
Always stand by your first count.

130
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,633
The odds are you're right.

131
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,119
Good call.

132
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,875
- You want me to check?
- I said, good call.

133
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,359
'It had taken him...

134
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,149
'45 minutes, but Jack
now had Mr Reynolds' number.

135
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,798
'The man couldn't count.'

136
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,236
Right. Just let me
run through a few things.

137
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,311
As a dealer, you never gamble.

138
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,674
Not anywhere.

139
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,557
And we'll need your picture.

140
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,471
- What for?
- For the database.

141
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,949
It's accessed by every
casino in the country.

142
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,792
It's the same system for punters.

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,598
- I don't gamble.
- Ever?.

144
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,558
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.

145
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,632
Huh. Next point.

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,832
Friendships between croupiers

147
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,878
inside or outside the casino
are discouraged.

148
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,235
Relationships with
females working here

149
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,912
are expressly forbidden.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,117
We had the same rule in Sun City
but it was impossible to check.

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,316
This isn't South Africa.

152
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,153
We'd know, because someone
would report it.

153
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,676
- Believe me, someone always does.
- Does know, or does report?.

154
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,797
What if I knew something like
that and didn't report it?.

155
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,476
We'd know. There are
no secrets in this casino.

156
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,120
- And you'd be punished.
- How?

157
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,636
First offence, verbal warning.
Second offence, written warning.

158
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,951
That one's filed and sometimes
copied to the Gaming Board.

159
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,156
My discretion.

160
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,152
Third offence,
you'd be sacked on the spot.

161
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,915
You'd never work in a casino
in this country again.

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,718
And there's another rule.

163
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,759
You're forbidden to talk
to or recognise a punter

164
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,193
outside the casino.

165
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,236
If you see someone
who's gambled here,

166
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,799
even casually on the street,

167
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,475
you must ignore him or her.

168
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,913
Not married, are you?

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,231
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.

170
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,514
She's not in the...

171
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,353
not in the gaming business, is she?

172
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,670
- No.
- Good.

173
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,270
This is our crow's nest.

174
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,033
I'm showing you it now,
but you'll never see it again.

175
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,951
Very impressive.

176
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,797
We have tapes here
that go back six months.

177
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,916
Here, let me show you something.

178
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,838
(Wheel spinning)

179
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,433
See that?.

180
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,715
Six weeks ago.

181
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,360
Dealer missed it.
Guy up here missed it.

182
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,352
I watch these tapes after hours.

183
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,510
Nothing gets by me.

184
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,160
Lady's in jail now.

185
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,913
It's easier to take ten million
pounds from a bank

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,719
than to take one penny
from this casino.

187
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,029
Right. Well, as soon as you get
your licence, you can start.

188
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,554
- Fine.
- So...

189
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,632
Are you planning to make
a career in casino work?

190
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,392
'And end up like you? '

191
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,072
I... I just want a job.

192
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,276
You're not the usual type
we get in here.

193
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,316
'Mr Reynolds was right. It was true.'

194
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,436
- (Phone)
- Excuse me.

195
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,078
'Jack was up above the world.

196
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,879
'A writer looking down
on his subject.

197
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,279
'A detached...'

198
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,271
I can't talk about that just now.

199
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,554
'..voyeur.'

200
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,394
I'm with somebody. They can wait.

201
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,875
I'll be home at the usual time.

202
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,471
Don't get married, Jack.

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,348
Casino work doesn't mix
with house and garden.

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,671
- Any questions?
- Yeah. What's the salary?

205
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,395
'The casino paid its staff
monthly in arrears.

206
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,109
'He would have to wait six weeks
for his first cheque.

207
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,952
'He needed money now.'

208
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,270
So, what kind of deal
are you looking for?.

209
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,396
What's the book price?

210
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,118
That's not relevant.

211
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,111
Old car like this.

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,112
Depends on the condition.

213
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,156
'The car was a gift
from Jack's father.

214
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,196
'That's to say,
Jack Sr gave it to him

215
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,078
'before the bailiffs arrived.'

216
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,913
And this ain't exactly
what you call mint.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,831
How about 1500?

218
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,150
- How about 500?
- What?.

219
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,995
How about we split the difference?
750.

220
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,991
Is that your idea of arithmetic?.

221
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,038
I'm not a mathematician.
I'm in business.

222
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,155
850.

223
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,798
750.

You mean I won't resist them.

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,592
No.

243
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,193
I'm not ready for you.

244
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,676

- You want me drunk?
- I won't take that long!

246
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,393
(Church bell chimes)

247
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,999
Jack.

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,513
Wow.

249
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,750
You really are a beautiful woman.

250
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,751
It's not just inner beauty, is it?.

251
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,353
Turn around.

252
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,757
You're all I desire.

253
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,315
- Where did you get it?.
- I sold the car.

254
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,551
You shouldn't have done that.
I know what it meant to you.

255
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,278
I owe you for the rent.

256
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,828
It's only a car. I can get another.

257
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,989
- Take it back.
- No.

258
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,559
Till you sell your book.

259
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,315
Marion, let's face the truth.
Nobody is gonna publish it.

260
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,550
Of course they are.

261
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,710
You just have to be patient.

262
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,673
I'm betting on you.

263
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,193
I'm not much of a bet.

264
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,191
You are to me.

265
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,676
Come into my world.

266
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,351
You're my prisoner.

267
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,510
I've got something to tell you.

268
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,830
- I wanna hear it.
- I've got a job.

269
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,275
(Sighs)

270
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,635
- What job?
- In a casino.

271
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,950
As a croupier. Dealer.

272
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,272
How did you land that?.

273
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,715
It came my way. 450 a week.

274
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,316
450?

275
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,472
What did you do? Walk in and
say, I want to be a croupier?.

276
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,869
- Don't you need training?
- I had training.

277
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,916
In the Republic.

278
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,991
You were a croupier there?

279
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,150
You never told me that.

280
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,549
I thought you just knew
some gamblers.

281
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,838
- I start Monday week.
- 450 a week?

282
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,150
I've never earned that in my life.

283
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,072
You're an enigma, you are.

284
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,832
A fucking enigma.

285
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,356
'I'm not an enigma.
Just a contradiction.'

286
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,839
You sold the car.

287
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,911
You've got a job.

288
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,716
What's the third thing?

289
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,993
Tell me.

290
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,033
There's no third thing.

291
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,636
Don't be superstitious.

292
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,518
I love you, Jack. You know that.

293
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,230
'And he half-loved Marion.
And she knew that, too.'

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,878
Jack Manfred.

357
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,915
Hi, Jack.

358
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,109
Welcome to the cesspit.

359
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,872
Is it that bad?

360
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,628
(Tyres screech on TV)

361
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,399
(Gunfire on TV)

362
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,154
How do I look?

363
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,878
'Like trouble, Bella.'

364
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,190
You look fine.

365
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,078
Tits in a uniform. Punters love it.

366
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,559
Your usual, sir.

367
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,437
Thank you, sir.

368
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,078
'50 quid for a Diet Coke.

369
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,879
'Waitresses were the
true winners in a casino.

'The only members of staff
allowed to accept tips.'

371
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,268
Thank you, Jack.
Enjoy yourself, Mr Tchai.

372
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,875
'On a good night they could get
200 or 300 quid.'

373
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,077
- Good evening, Mr Tchai.
- Evening.

374
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,879
Mr Tchai always likes
to sit at that table.

375
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,518
And only with Bella.

376
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,033
Does he win?

377
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,758
He's a good customer.

378
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,910
'A good customer
is a consistent loser.

379
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,195

(Toilet flushes)

381
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,152
- Where d'you live, Jack?
- Over the river.

382
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,992
- You got transport?.
- No.

383
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,117
I'm going over the river.
I'll give you a lift if you like.

384
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,952
Nice one. Thanks.

385
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,629
(Thumping music)

386
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,039
(Tyres screech)

387
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,869
So how d'you feel -
your first night on the job?

388
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,279
Bet you're on a high.

389
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,598
- Nice car.
- She's my baby.

390
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,671
How long have you worked
at the casino?

391
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,115
Coming up to two years now.

392
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,792
But I was away for six months.

393
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,633
Looks like you've done pretty well.

394
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,553
Not bad.
I have other interests, of course.

395
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,835
Listen, I'm off to
a little watering hole.

396
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,239
Have a few drinks. Relax.

397
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,878
- Want to join me?
- No thanks.

398
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,078
I'm gonna go home.
I need my eight hours.

399
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,355
I bet you five to one
you won't get any sleep.

400
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,874
You've got to unwind
in this job, Jack,

401
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,279
or it'll kill you.

402
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,510
- I mean that.
- Some other time.

403
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,108
(Voices in street)

404
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,311
- What time is it?.
- No idea.

405
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,474
- How did it go?
- Yeah. Fine.

406
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,916
You're shaking.

407
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,310
- What is it?.
- It's just tension.

408
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,868
- It'll go.
- Poor baby.

409
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,069
This'll relax you.

410
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,552
- I loved it blonde.
- Look, it's only hair.

411
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,119
I haven't changed.

412
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,198
When you come home, I'm asleep.

413
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,998
When I leave home, you're asleep.

414
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,559
Mmm.

415
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,874
Bye.

416
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,676
I'll see you in my dreams.

421
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,589

34 red. No, I'm sorry, sir.
That's a late bet.

444
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,276
What are you talking about?.
34. I won with this lady.

445
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,954
No. You've won with the chips
you placed earlier,

446
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,598
but the bet on 34 was a late bet.

447
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,874
I put it all together.

448
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,349
(Jack) I'm afraid not, sir.
(Cheat) Look...

449
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,112
Is there a problem?

450
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,760
This croupier is accusing me
of cheating.

451
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,229
Do you think I cheated?

452
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,073
(Foreign accent)
In my opinion, it was a late bet.

453
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,913
I think we should talk, sir,
away from the table.

454
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,719
No. I won. I want to be paid.

455
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,836
Pay the gentleman.

In full.

457
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,199

459
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,156
(Reynolds) We'd better talk
in my office.

460
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,390
- (Cheat) Why?
- We paid out this time,

461
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,677
but you won't be welcome here again.

462
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,514
- You bastard!
- On your way, please, sir.

1300.

464
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,759
I'm sorry, madam.

465

We're not allowed to accept
gratuities in the UK.

466

(Loud music)

474
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,158
Matt, listen. There's something
I've got to say to you.

475
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,514
I saw you cheating.

476
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,591
What the fuck are you
talking about?.

477
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,592
That Greek guy at the end.
You paid him out 25s, not 10s.

478
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,716
You got it wrong, Jack.
I don't cheat.

479
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,392
I'm not gonna report it.

480
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,473
(Horn honks)

481
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,950
- What are you, a fucking cop?
- If you do it again, I will.

482
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,600
I don't get you. Even if
it was true, which it isn't,

483
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,955
what the fuck difference
would it make to you?

484
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,600
If the supervisor knew I saw
and didn't report it,

485
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,636
I'd lose my job
and I can't afford that.

486
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,790
Oh, so it's Mr Clean.

487
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,553
Wise up, Jack.
This whole business is bent.

488
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,870
The casino's nothing but legal theft

489
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,552
and that's OK - it's the system.

490
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,632
Half the punters who come here
are using stolen money.

491
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,075
Drugs money.
They haven't even earned it.

492
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,754
We earn our money.

493
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,479
I'm on your side, Jack.
I don't need an enemy.

494
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,516
You're talking about complicity.

495
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,750
I don't even know what that means.

496
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,354
I'm talking about
not rocking the boat.

497
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,192
'Matt was an escape artist.

498
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,118
'Like Jack's father.'

499
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,318
OK. Now, let's unwind.

500
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,759
Hey, Andros.

501
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,193
(Speaks Greek)

502
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,718
This is Jack.

503
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,358
- Hello.
- How you doing?

504
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,192
(Greek music)

505
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,316
- Blackjack.
- One blackjack and...

506
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,278
- Drink?
- Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.

507
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,952
Vodka straight coming up.

508
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,959
- Who are these guys?
- A few drug dealers.

509
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,918
Mostly people that work
in the casino business.

510
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,275
- And the girls?
- Just girls.

511
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,318
Blackjack. Vodka straight.

512
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,474
- Does Bella come here?
- The bitch? No.

513
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,959
(Man) Matt, you want in?

514
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,678
Yeah, why not?.

515
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,918
(Door creaks)

516
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,197
Jack, join us?

517
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,633
No thanks.

518
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,439
- I won't report you.
- I don't gamble.

519
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,234
You don't gamble. But do you smoke?

520
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,799
Sometimes.

521
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,912
How about now?

522
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,389
(Laughter)

523
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,910
- Same again, yeah?
- Coming up.

524
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,395
(Woman moaning)

525
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,199
'Marion, I'm on my way.'

526
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,672
All right, lads. Divvy up.

527
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,479
Listen, I'm gonna get off.
I need to sleep.

528
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,199
Loosen up. If you don't,
this job'll get to you.

529
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,111
Pressure's too much. Believe me.

530
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,351
- It'll break you.
- "The world breaks everyone.

531
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,477
"And afterwards many are strong
at the broken places."

532
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,316
Ernest Hemingway.

533
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,995
Wasn't he the one who shot himself?

534
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,953
(Church bell chimes)

535
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,869
Where have you been?

536
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,235
I've got to give evidence
in court at nine.

537
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,993
Don't play the policewoman
with me, Marion.

538
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,039
Take that back!

539
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,236
Fucking take that back!

540
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,639
Yeah, I take it back.

541
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,950
You're not in the police any more.

542
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,031
You're a store detective.

543
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,190
Are you drunk?

544
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,271
Probably.

545
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,237
This fucking job's getting to you.

546
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,515
You haven't written
a fucking word lately.

547
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,670
D'you have to swear all the time?

548
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,159
That's my poor upbringing.

549
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,118
I didn't go to private school.

550
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,156
I haven't got any class.

551
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,995
I wanna live with a writer.

552
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,672
Not a fucking croupier.

553
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,513
I don't even know
what the word means.

554
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,749
Croupier.

555
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,432
Marion, stop this.

556
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,795
What do I mean to you?

557
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,756
I want to know.

558
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,512
Tell me.

559
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,392
You're my conscience.

560
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,195
Haven't you got a conscience
of your own?

561
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,034
(Door slams)

562
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,351
Fuck. Shit!

563
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,558
(Siren)

564
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,354
No. It's not the one. Thank you.

565
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,678
Fancy a drink after work?

566
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,149
What are you doing here?
You know the rules.

567
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,710
- I don't finish till nine.
- Shit. I'm on at nine.

568
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,837
That's our life now, isn't it?.

569
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,589
(Phone)

570
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,109
(Man in distance)
# Show me the way to go home

571
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,273
# I'm tired
and I want to go to bed

572
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,794
# I had a little drink
about an hour ago... #

573
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,269
Thinking of going back?

574
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,759
Oh, my God. Hello.

575
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,196
You know what?.
I'd like to buy you a drink.

576
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,838
It's against the rules.

577
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,150
Dealers are forbidden
to talk to punters.

578
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,435
What are the odds
of you being seen with me?

579
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,876
Impossible to calculate.

580
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,996
It's a coincidence.

581
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,310
You know, there's a casino
in this hotel.

582
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,630
I'm not really much of a gambler.

583
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,551
I just like this bar.

584
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,076
- First visit to London?
- No.

585
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,912
I come every couple of years.

586
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,958
I always plan to stay, but...

587
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,758
I'm from Cape Town originally.

588
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,751
I was born in the Transkei.

589
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,274
- On the Wild Coast.
- Near the casino.

590
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,157
In the casino.

591
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,958
(Laughs)
There's a coincidence -

592
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,871
my father used to gamble there.

593
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,188
Your father?.

594
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,316
I loved the atmosphere.

595
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,675
But it destroyed my mother.

596
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,991
- The debts?
- And the lies.

597
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,435
Gamblers are born liars.

598
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,317
And superstitious.

599
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,039
It's like witchcraft.

600
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,076
That's Africa.

601
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,628
There's an African
in all of us, isn't there?

602
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,235
We all came from Africa supposedly.

603
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,390
Do you believe in astrology?

604
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,232
Absolutely not.

605
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,279
But then I'm a Gemini.
Geminis don't believe in astrology.

606
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,031
You know, you don't strike me
as a typical croupier.

607
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,430
Ah, I'm not married.

608
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,272
I just wear it to keep the flies off.

609
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,475
(Pager)

610
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,075
Look, I have to go.

611
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,718
Let me pay for this.

612
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,756
- Absolutely not.
- Toss you for it.

613
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,989
I don't gamble.

614
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,638
(Piano)

615
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,394
I know this is verboten,

616
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,268
but if you feel like a chat,
or maybe dinner,

617
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,873
give me a call.

618
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,439
I'll understand if you don't.

619
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,748
But I hope that you do.

620
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,515
'Jack started to dress
for the casino at home.

621
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,750
'A man in love with his uniform.

622
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,796
'Like a musician in his tuxedo

'Eager to perform.'

(Wheel spins)

626
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,312
No more bets. Thank you.

627
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,311
(Ball drops)

628
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,799
19 red.

629

(Man choking)

630
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,871
Animal!

631
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,996
'The croupier registered disgust.'

632
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,833
This gentleman's accidentally
coughed on the chips.

'The writer made a note.'

Agnes.

635
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,759
'Good scene for the book.'

636
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,751
Take these chips
off the table for me.

637
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,191
I can't give you a lift back tonight.

638
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,191
Don't worry about it.

639
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,073
(Man) See you, Jack.
(Jack) Yeah, see you.

640
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,470
Jack, d'you want a lift?.

641
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,596
No. I'm OK, thanks.

642
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,875
Maybe some other time.

643
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,155
I'll take you up on that.

644
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,232
Hey, you don't recognise me?

645
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,276
You had me barred, you little worm.

646
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,874
If I remember rightly,
you got yourself barred.

647
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,632
No, it was you, you shit.

648
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,199
(Groans)

649
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,358
(Loud music)

650
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,593
Jack!

651
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,908
Jack! Come on, leave him.

652
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,118
Jack, You don't want
the police here. Come on.

653
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,354
(Music stops)

654
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,632
(Bella) Jack!

655
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,878
He won't cheat again.

656
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,632
You're shaking.

657
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,950
It's nothing.

658
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,519
Just tension.

659
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,918
(Groans)

660
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,592
Fuck!

661
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,638
Oh, shit.

662
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,869
(Gasps)

663
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,353
It's funny, isn't it.

664
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,591
If that bloke hadn't come over,
you wouldn't be here now.

665
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,957
I hate cheats.

666
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,708
All men are cheats.

667
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,558
Are they?

668
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,717
Fools.

669
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,631
I spent a year on the game.

670
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,270
Don't worry. I'm clean as a whistle.

671
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,716
I only did S and M.
No blowjobs. No screwing.

672
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,469
Why did you stop?

673
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,915
Got scared.

674
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,798
Yeah. I can imagine.

675
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,108
Can you?

676
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,236
Anyway, I'm happy being a dealer now.

677
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,198
At least the punters keep
their hands to themselves,

678
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,872
even if the other dealers don't.

679
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,638
You called the casino a cesspit.

680
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,990
Well, it is.

681
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,514
But at least I know where I am.

682
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,160
I've been watching you work.

683
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,593
You're good.

684
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,671
Too fucking good for that place.

685
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,910
I despise the job.

686
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,070
If you hate it so much,
why d'you do it?.

687
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,958
Jack suddenly had the feeling
that he was transparent.

688
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,712
That Bella could see through him.

689
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,189
- You've got a guilty look.
- We broke the rules.

690
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,317
'He hadn't meant to say that.
She'd caught him unawares.'

691
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,118
You're different from the others.

692
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,749
'Careful. This liaison, forbidden in
the casino family, was incest.'

693
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,751
Not like Matt, you mean.

694
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,152
Now there's a real shit.
Don't get friendly with him.

695
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,073
D'you know what he said to me once?

696
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,073
"I wanna fuck the whole world
over. That's my mission."

697
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,276
Stupid little shit.

698
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,035
'Thank you, Bella.

699
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,672
'Jack could hear Matt saying it.

700
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,275
'"I want to
fuck the whole world over.

701
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,271
'"It's my mission."

702
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,112
'Eureka. Jack had struck gold.

'He'd found a protagonist

'Little Matt.

'Chapter one.'

706
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,957
I look like shit.

707
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,998
- Rough day?
- Rough life, Jack.

708
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,476
- Hi. I'm Pat.
- Hello.

709
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,754
See you, boys.

710
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,400
- What happened to Bella?
- I'll tell you later.

711
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,472
Change.

712
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,915
5,000.

713
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,592
What has happened to Bella?

714
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,113
What's happened to Bella?

715
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,713
She's been re-assigned.

716
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,917
'Not re-assigned.
Just written out of the story.'

717
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,035
Good evening.

718
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,235
Hundreds.

719
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,511
Change. 1,000.

720
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,756
'This was no coincidence.'

721
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,272
15.

722
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,349
Too many.

723
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,438
20, 18, 19, 17...

724
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,635
19.

725
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,996
'Did she think he'd bring her luck? '

726
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,078
Can I get anything for you?

727
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,755
14.

728
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,353
'Why had she come? '

729
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,589
Too many.

730
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,398
'Did she want him to help her win? '

731
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,552
11 double. 21.

732
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,029
18, 17, 17...

733
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,156
13, 20.

734
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,389
Change.

735
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,959
'He knew how to fix it for her.'

736
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,189
1,000.

737
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,271
'His father had taught him the trick.

738
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,476
'The casino wouldn't spot it,

739
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,279
'but Jack was wary of the punters.'

740
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,635
11 double.

741
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,837
'He could see Mr Tchai was counting.

742
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,990
'He couldn't risk it.'

743
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,953
12.

744
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,795
20. 18, 18, 17...

745
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,795
19.

746
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,077
'She wasn't wearing her ring.
Odds on she'd sold it.'

747
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,429
Thank you. Goodnight.

748
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,556
Goodnight.

749
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,349
'Thank you, she said.
For what, Jack thought.

750
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,113
'He ought to thank her.'

751
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,474
Pretty woman.

752
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,279
'Jani de Villiers
had just entered his book.'

753
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,793
Place your bets, please.

754
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,632
(Opera)

755
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,312
(Rustling)

756
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,349
(Phone)

757
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,953
Yeah.

758
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,715
- How's it going, Jacko?
- 'Fine. I took that job.'

759
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,995
Good. I was wondering
what was happening.

760
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,072
I tried to call you but
your line was disconnected.

761
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,833
Ah, yes. I moved house.

762
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,478
I needed a bigger place.

763
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,471
'How's that book of yours coming on? '

764
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,516
Yeah. I'm getting there.

765
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,239
'It's a good job you've got
the job to fall back on.'

766
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,437
Huh? Oh, there's
my other line. Ciao.

767
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,352
I don't like it.

768
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,875
Why not?.

769
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,679
I don't like it at all.

770
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,195
It had a wonderful character before.

771
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,874
The gambler was so romantic.

772
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,315
He was a loser.

773
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,515
This guy's a croupier.

774
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,795
He can't lose.

775
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,997
People have shat on him all his
life and now he's in control.

776
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,069
He's a winner.

777
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,799
Is that your idea of a winner?.

778
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,757
He couldn't give a shit about anyone.

779
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,354
- He uses people...
- It's because of the sex.

780
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,759
You don't like the sex.

781
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,150
I couldn't give a fuck about the sex.

782
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,151
Most men'll fuck a lamppost.

783
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,958
He's just a miserable zombie.

784
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,029
Is that the way you feel now?

785
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,680
Is that what's happened to you?

786
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,275
- Marion, it's a book.
- Really?

787
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,397
Then why is he called Jake?
Why don't you come clean

788
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,754
and call him Jack?

789
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,877
There's no hope in it.

790
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,396
It's the truth.

791
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,040
Without hope,
there's no point to anything.

792
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,112
What is so fucking hopeful
about your job?

793
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,158
Spending the day catching
poor people stealing?

794
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,549
You say the organised gangs
get away with it.

795
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,154
In the casino everyone
gets caught, rich or poor.

796
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,356
The odds are the same,
it's all relative.

797
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,317
Crap. It is not relative.

798
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,994
It's unfair. It's designed unfair.

799
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,719
Like your casino and your
croupier's a little shit

800
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,279
because he goes along with it.

801
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,952
Yeah, what about the lottery?

802
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,598
(Doorbell)

803
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,592
Look at this. You're like
all the other suckers out there.

804
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,274
14 million to one.
Is that your idea of hope?

805
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,032
- The door, Jack.
- Leave it.

806
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,758
No. Answer it.

807
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,112
Just called round to say
thanks for shopping me, Jack.

808
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,117
What are you talking about?.

809
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,431
Reynolds got a doctor in.
They forced me to do a dope test

810
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,192
which was positive, as you knew.

811
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,838
I don't know anything about it.

812
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,070
- Hiya.
- Hi.

813
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,879
Your boyfriend fucked me,
smoked my dope then shopped me.

814
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,157
What do you think about that?.
I can't get a job now.

815
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,470
You're no different from Matt.

816
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,074
Pair of vicious shits,
that's what you are.

817
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,310
Bella, I don't know
anything about this.

818
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,675
- All men are scumbags.
- I agree.

819
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,669
Well, go on. Go after her.

820
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,830
'He was Jack and he was Jake.

821
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,912
'And he had discovered
there was a price to pay

822
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,230
'for this double life of his.

823
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,675
'He had no idea where Marion
was staying or with whom.

824
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,672
'He realised he knew little
about her life, but then...

825
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,751
'he had never asked about it.

826
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,710
'For the first time in a long while,
Jack thought about his mother.

827
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,189
'She'd left when she couldn't
take it any more.

828
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,068
'His father had said, "Don't
worry, she'll come back."

829
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,310
'She didn't.

830
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,914
'But Marion wasn't his mother.'

831
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,395
He's paying out twenty-fives,
not tens.

832
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,119
I see that.

833
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,838
Little shit, Matt.

834
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,319
'Chapter three,

835
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,073
'his existence was forming
a pattern of betrayals.

836
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,391
'Sometimes he was unsure whether
he was betrayer or betrayed.'

837
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,631
- Thanks for the information.
- Pleasure.

838
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,790
Pity about Bella.

839
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,474
She was a real asset.

840
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,630
What could I do?

841
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,036
Sorry, Jack. No smoking in the nest.

842
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,314
(Phone)

843
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,236
Thank you, sir.

844
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,551
Fantastic. Just down here.

845
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,115
Jack?

846
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,792
(Laughs)

847
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,632
I thought it was you. It's the hair.

848
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,950
Listen, I'm working on
that soccer story.

849
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,395
Right. Look,
I must get back to Habib.

850
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,914
- Habib?
- My author.

851
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,276
He's a terrorist.
He's written a kill-and-tell book.

852
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,078
Take care.

853
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,957
That's 4.99, sir. Thank you.

854
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,750
Jack, next weekend
I'm having a house party.

855
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,437
Here. It's just near Oxford.

856
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,079
Why don't you come?

857
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,037
It'll just be social, no business.

858
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,953
Bring a friend,
I've got plenty of room.

859
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,476
- I'll try and make it.
- Good. Looking forward.

860
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,198
Right!

861
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,072
- Your change, sir.
- Thanks.

862
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,319
'Books piled like chips.

863
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,597
'Stack 'em high, sell 'em fast,
make a killing.

00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,398
'No dumb soccer novel for Jack.

'Chapter four.'

868
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,957
I don't know how you can drive
at night in those glasses.

869
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,271
How'd you hurt your hand?

870
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,318
It was just an accident.
It's nothing.

871
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,595
Should be the next on the right.

872
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,397
Jani, there's something I want
to say before we get there.

873
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,040
I don't know what the sleeping
arrangements are.

874
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,032
Giles probably expects us
to share a room.

875
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,031
That's fine.

876
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,273
(Voices and laughter)

877
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:01,590
Look, it's no use pretending
it was an accident.

878
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,513
I had a fight with someone.
That's all.

879
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,238
She's a dab hand with
the racket, your friend.

880
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,516
South African women are very sporty.

881
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,033
So I see.

882
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,553
(Man) Nice serve.

883
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,119
(Woman) 40-15.

884
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,997
How did she get that shiner?.

885
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,309
I found her in bed with someone.

886
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,799
Who was he?

887
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,233
She.

888
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,155
I say, you're a dark horse, Jack.

889
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,753
(Man) Lovely shot. Game.

890
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,314
- Come on, Jack.
- I don't gamble.

891
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,675
Don't be a spoil-sport.
It's only a few quid.

892
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,149
It's nothing to do with money.
I don't gamble.

893
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,434
He doesn't gamble.

894
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,988
- I'll watch.
- Jack likes to watch.

895
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,469
Does he like to watch?

896
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,994
One more remark
and I'll break your balls.

897
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,789
I bet she could.

898
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,717
I'll deal, but I won't play.

899
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,037
Sure you know how?

900
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,352
'The hands of a conjurer.

901
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,552
'Or a cardsharp.'

902
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,119
OK. Last hand.

903
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,078
- I've got an idea.
- No, no stripping.

904
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,116
We're not having that again.

905
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,315
Although...

906
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,955
I'll stick to bluffing.
That's what I'm best at.

907
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,632
- 'Stick.'
- Stick.

908
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,835
I don't know.

909
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,957
- 'Two cards.'
- Two cards.

910
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,600
- 'Two cards.'
- Two cards.

911
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,071
- 'One card. '
- One card.

912
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,277
- 'Three cards. '
- Three.

913
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,189
I'll start with a tenner.

914
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,678
I'll see your ten
and I'll raise you ten.

915
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,354
I'll see your 20
and raise you ten.

916
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,996
30, raise ten.

917
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,037
40. Raise you by 20.

918
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,317
I'll match that
and raise you a tenner.

919
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,308
I'm in.

920
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,030
Yes. That's it.
I haven't got any more cash.

921
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,479
Yeah.

922
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,551
I call.

923
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,437
See you.

924
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,911
A straight.

925
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,479
Beat that.

926
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,437
A flush.

927
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,919
Shit.

928
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,675
Not so fast, darling. Full house.

929
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,320
(Man) Hang on, chaps.
That's impossible.

930
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,514
How's about this for impossible?

931
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,318
Four of a kind.

932
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,719
(Laughter)

933
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,836
(Man) What's going on?
(Woman) No.

934
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,189
Straight flush.

935
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,316
What are the odds of this happening?

936
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,799
Thousands to one.

937
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,836
42,300,000 to one.

938
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,114
Approximately.

939
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,670
Could have won
if I'd been able to bluff.

940
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,751
I get it.

941
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,349
Get what?.

942
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,396
Are you accusing me of cheating?

943
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,913
Good, God. No.

944
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,389
With a skill like that,
why do you want a job?

945
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,436
You don't need to work.

946
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,548
(Toilet flushes)

947
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,279
'Here was an interesting question.

948
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,079
'Was writing work?

949
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,991
'Or play? '

950
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,389
What happened?

951
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,559
Remember that guy
who cheated at the table?

952
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,596
You don't like cheats, do you?

953
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,592
So, which side do you like?

954
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,479
You choose.

955
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,994
That trick tonight.

956
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,389
I don't think I've ever
seen that done before.

957
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,995
It can only work with amateurs.
A pro would have spotted it.

958
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,116
- I didn't.
- Then you're not a pro.

959
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,037
Goodnight.

960
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,309
Jack.

961
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,589
Jack, I need your help.

962
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,355
I'm in a lot of trouble.

963
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,548
What kind of trouble?

964
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,279
I owe a lot of money.

965
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,590
Was that why you did that two grand?

966
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,478
- I couldn't help you.
- I know that.

967
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,357
But you can now.

968
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,476
I'm sorry. I don't have any money.

969
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,828
Some people I know.

970
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,992
They're planning
to rob the Golden Lion.

971
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,911
- You don't mean that.
- They mean it.

972
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,513
- Who's they?
- My creditors.

973
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,115
One night, around 3 am,
they'll come to the casino...

974
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,397
Forget it. It'll never work.

975
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,110
The point is,
they want a man inside.

976
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,918
I took you for a bright woman.

977
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,992
Just listen. You don't have
to do anything criminal.

978
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,992
- Robbery's not criminal?.
- You don't have to be criminal.

979
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,310
A guy'll deliberately
cheat at your table.

980
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,072
You'll see him, stop him.

981
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,630
The guy'll make a big scene
and that's when it'll happen.

982
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,399
You're serious.

983
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,072
You won't be committing a crime.

984
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,311
The man'll cheat, you'll just
be doing your job. That's all.

985
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,879
Shit.

986
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,599
And I thought you were
only after my body.

987
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,238
I've come to know you.

988
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,756
You're honest. I can trust you.

989
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,912
So what will you do
when it all goes wrong?

990
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,877
- It won't.
- If it does.

991
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,516
You'll keep the 10,000 pounds.

992
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,239
What 10,000 pounds?

993
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,075
These people will pay you
10,000 before

994
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,718
and 10,000 after.

995
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,514
They want someone
they can be sure of.

996
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,955
An honest dealer.

997
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,678
That's the point.

998
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,671
Not all dealers are honest.

999
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,677
Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.

1000
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,911
Reynolds. You've done your research.

1001
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,230
There was nothing else I could do.

1002
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,592
You're my last chance.

1003
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,552
Next time it'll be my neck.

1004
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,949
What about my neck?

1005
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,669
I want to go back to Cape Town.

1006
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,990
I want to start again. Clean.

1007
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,078
Can't do it, Jani.

1008
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,789
I'm asking you as a friend.

1009
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,677
(Sobs) You'd be saving
the life of a friend.

1010

- Not really.

You can't afford a decent place.

1078

Yes. Yes, it's better.
