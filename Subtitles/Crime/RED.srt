1
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,190
943-66-2291. Pension Services, please.

2
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,950
Thank you, Mr. Moses,
please hold for your representative.

3
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,670
Hi, this is Sarah.

4
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,130
It's Frank Moses.

5
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,590
Hey, Frank. What is going on?

6
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,260
Not much.

7
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,100
I just called because
they didn't send that check out again.

8
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,900
Oh. I can't believe
they haven't worked this out by now.

9
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,530
I'll make sure they send
another one out today.

10
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,150
I'm so sorry.

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
Well, what are you going to do?

12
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,780
So how's your avocado?

13
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,330
It's got two green leaves on it.

14
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,700
Yippee!

15
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,750
I told you, you could grow something.

16
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,210
Well, it was pretty close.
It was life or death.

17
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,590
I'm not kidding.
It could have gone either way.

18
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,170
How's your day going?

19
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,760
My day? My day sucks.

20
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,180
Your day sucks?

21
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,140
Yeah.

22
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,810
Right now I just want to travel
you know ...

23
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,610
I'm thinking Chile.
Sounds like an adventure. I don't know.

24
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,570
You ever been to Chile?

25
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,230
Yeah.

26
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,990
You have? What's it like?

27
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,780
Mountains.

28
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,780
That's it?

29
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,700
Well, it was night, I... I ...

30
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,910
It was uh...

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,120
Look, I got to go.

32
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,080
Okay. Sure.

33
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,790
No, sorry, it's just Gladys.

34
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,710
What?

35
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,920
"It was night."

36
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,400
Hi, Mr. Moses!

37
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,940
Hi.

38
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,020
- Did you start that new book?
- I did.

39
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,640
And, what's it called?

40
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,440
It's called "Loves savage secret".

41
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,230
Oh, my God!

42
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
Is it any good?

43
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,610
It's terrible. I love it. It's awful.

44
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,910
It's about this fashion designer

45
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,830
and his supermodel girlfriend,
and they get recruited

46
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,670
by the CIA to stop an assassination
at the Milan spring shows.

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,090
Well, who doesn't like Milan in the spring?

48
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,250
I guess.

49
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,590
Anyway,
I got to do something for excitement.

50
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,590
My landlady keeps trying to set me up
with her bridge partners' kids.

51
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,550
She just told me she thinks 
I'm gay.

52
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,100
I try not to judge.

53
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,390
What? Shut up! I'm not gay.

54
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,520
So here's something weird ...

55
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,070
I'm actually going to be
in Kansas City next week.

56
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,990
In person?

57
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Mmm-hmm.

58
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,030
Wow. That could be a bad idea.

59
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,990
It could be...

60
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,210
You still there?

61
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,790
- Yeah... yeah.

62
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,470
Why don't you call me
when you get to town?

63
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,890
Er... yeah.

64
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,510
Okay. Bye.

65
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,140
Okay, bye.

66
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,150
Okay.

67
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,610
All right.

68
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,880
Come in, Unit One.

69
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,300
Come in, Unit One.

70
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,260
Unit One, respond.

71
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,790
Hey, aren't you going to invite me in?

72
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,830
No, I don't think so.

73
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,410
But I bought you dinner!

74
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,210
Wow.

75
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,550
Wow! Wow!

76
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,260
And you live with your mother.

77
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,020
Awesome.

78
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,230
Yeah, of course. You have no job.

79
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,740
You, mister, are not getting any of this.

80
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,910
Hey.

81
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,040
It's me. Frank.

82
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,420
The avocado?

83
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,090
Why are you here? Get out of my house!

84
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,800
- Hey!
- I told you to call first.

85
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,260
I'm not going to hurt you.

86
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,770
Would you just listen to me? Please?
Stop that!

87
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,770
Get back. Go away. Stay away from me!

88
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,810
Is that my bag?

89
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,190
Yeah.

90
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,320
You, you packed it?

91
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,530
Yes.

92
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,360
Did you vacuum?

93
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,570
A little, yeah, it was messy.

94
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,990
Get back! Get out, get out.

95
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,780
Please, you have to leave right now ... 
Stop it.

96
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,370
- Help! Help!
- Hey! Just listen to me, please!

97
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,160
- Someone is trying to kill me.
- Help!

98
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,960
- What are you doing? Listen to me!
- Intruder!

99
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,130
- Help!
- They've been trying to kill you, too.

100
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,550
Why would anyone want to kill me?

101
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,750
Because we've been under surveillance.

102
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,260
They've been listening
to our conversations.

103
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,510
Why?

104
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,340
Because of the way I talk to you.

105
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,220
What?

106
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,180
They know I like you.

107
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,940
Listen to me. Right now. Out the back door.

108
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,530
No way! No!

109
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,490
Don't get me wrong,
I know it's crazy.

110
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,830
Don't think that

111
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't think this is crazy.

112
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,830
And it... 

113
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,300
...couldn't be more different than how
I had hoped to meet you for the first time.

114
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,300
But you know, sometimes
things happen

115
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,180
And I just hope that someday
you and I could be ...

116
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,730
...sitting somewhere, comfortably

117
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,940
...and look back on this
as the great, big adventure that it is.

118
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,460
I'm a little hungry, too.
What should we get?

119
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,130
Pizza.

120
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,300
Listen honey.

121
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,680
Yeah, lots of boys get bullied at school.

122
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,230
I know, but you can't solve it
by intervening like that.

123
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,610
No, I don't agree with you.

124
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,910
I'll, I'll talk to him
about it when I get home.

125
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,290
Mmm-hmm.

126
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,290
No, I should be on time tonight.

127
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,300
Milk, two percent? Okay, love you, bye.

128
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,890
Listen. I can make you rich.

129
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,850
Don't you know who I am?

130
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
Of course, I do.

131
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,760
This is off the books. Total blackout.

132
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,590
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,390
There's your target.

134
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,270
Retired analyst.

135
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,770
He was CIA.

136
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,390
Is that a problem?

137
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,150
No.

138
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,790
Sorry.

139
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,180
Wow. If you let me go now,
I won't press charges.

140
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,180
- There's no hard feelings.
- We're way past charges.

141
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,310
How do I always attract losers like you?

142
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,640
I was in the CIA.

143
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,230
Yeah, I bet you were. 
I'll bet you're a spy.

144
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,150
I have to go see someone now...

145
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,150
You're just going to make me sit here?
Like this?

146
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,860
You couldn't be safer.
No one knows where you are.

147
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,530
Oh no you don't, don't do it.

148
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,370
- Just hold still.
- Don't please. I don't want it.

149
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,290
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

150
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,250
Your eyes are so beautiful.

151
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,050
Want to watch TV?

152
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,350
Be back soon.

153
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,560
Is that thing acting up again?

154
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,860
Oh hi, Marna. Yeah ...I

155
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,030
Give it a whack will ya?
See if you could get it going for me.

156
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,780
Oh, of course.

157
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,950
I don't know why you don't
fix this old thing.

158
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,450
Get a better picture.

159
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,620
- Try a little bit more to the left.
- Okay.

160
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,120
Yeah...

161
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,960
That's just perfect.

162
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,220
Thank you very much, Marna.

163
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,180
Unbelievable.

164
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,020
Should be ashamed of yourself.

165
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,820
It's nice to see you, kid.

166
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,450
It's good to see you, too.

167
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,210
So what's up?

168
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,290
I met a girl.

169
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,840
No...

170
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Complicated.

171
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,720
Got a visit from a wet team.

172
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,800
At my house, 24 hours ago.

173
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,890
Did you ID any of them?

174
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,390
Kind of.

175
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,400
This used to be a gentleman's game.

176
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,550
And you know I love you. Bye.

177
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,310
Independent South African hit team

178
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,270
Suspected of killing a
New York Times reporter.

179
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,230
Stephanie Chan. You know her?

180
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,690
No.

181
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,860
Somebody has a serious
hard on for you, kid.

182
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,160
Yeah.

183
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,280
But why now? I'm retired.

184
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,750
We'll just have to dig some more.

185
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,620
Watch your back, too.

186
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,630
I'm 80 years old, I got stage 4 liver cancer.

187
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,920
- What the hell can they do to me?
- They can still shoot you.

188
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,090
Well...

189
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,220
I never thought this would happen to me.

190
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,560
What?

191
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,690
Getting old.

192
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,780
I mean, Vietnam, Afghanistan.

193
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,950
Green Springs Rest Home?

194
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,290
Go figure.

195
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,510
So Moses made 22 calls
to Pension Services

196
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,140
and that didn't stand out to you?

197
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,060
Unbelievable.

198
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,160
Hooray... ha...

199
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,330
Have Endercott intercept the girl
at the Hotel Capri.

200
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,250
Mike, change of plans.

201
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,460
She's just fine.

202
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,920
I can take you home.

203
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,180
Oh.

204
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,550
I got to take you down to the
station first to get your statement.

205
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,560
Then there's a couple of federal guys
that are going to want to talk to you.

206
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,600
I got to say, I think you're
pretty amazing for breaking free

207
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,390
and keeping it together like you did.

208
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
That's impressive.

209
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,320
Um, I'm going to go back and get my purse...

210
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,900
Well, I can have somebody
bring it downtown for you.

211
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,280
- Get in the car!
- Ow!

212
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,530
Let me go! You're hurting me.

213
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,960
Am I going to die?

214
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,830
No. You just need some sleep.

215
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,580
I may vomit.

216
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,470
Aww, that is just like "Loves
savage secret".

217
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,980
I am... high.

218
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
You have such beautiful green eyes.

219
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,050
Wow. You really are CIA.

220
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,850
Officer down.
Corner of North Peters and Conclese.

221
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,680
Suspect is a white male, 30s,
black suit and a tie,

222
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,310
driving a black Tahoe.

223
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,650
Freeze! Put your weapon
on the ground.... Now!

224
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,440
Put your weapon on the ground now!

225
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,530
Get down, down right now!

226
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,830
So you're saying
this was CIA sanctioned?

227
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,950
All right, Thelma, thanks.
I owe you one. Bye.

228
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,970
So it's like that, huh?

229
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,140
Yeah. It's like that.

230
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,280
Where are we?

231
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,290
Ho... How did we get to New York City?

232
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,960
Wow, I really hate you right now.

233
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,210
I...I was just hoping you'd be a little
more understanding of the situation.

234
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,260
I was hoping not to get kidnapped.
Or drugged.

235
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,680
I was hoping you'd have hair.

236
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,510
So it looks like none of our dreams
are coming true, at the moment.

237
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,970
I'm sorry about that.

238
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,060
Thanks for saving me. I guess.

239
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,480
No problem.

240
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,650
Not my best first date.

241
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,320
Not my worst, either.

242
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,990
Until we find out who's trying to kill us,
you're going to have to stay with me.

243
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,790
For how long?

244
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,870
I don't know.

245
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,040
Whoever's trying to kill us
also killed a New York Times reporter.

246
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,300
She used to live in Chinatown.

247
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,480
Okay. Here we go. Let's get in
here. Right here. Wait a second.

248
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,940
- You just hang onto this tape.
- Oh, no.

249
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,780
No, you said we were just going to talk to her.

250
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,570
We are. I know, this will help.

251
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,200
- The woman just lost her daughter.
- I know.

252
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,450
You can't just go around
duct taping everyone.

253
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,040
People are basically kind of decent.

254
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,620
That hasn't always been my experience.

255
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,630
Let me try and talk to her.

256
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,590
- What?
- Just let me, let me do it.

257
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,140
They told me to be patient.

258
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,140
The police have done nothing.

259
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:08,140
They said it was just a burglary,
but nothing was missing.

260
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,980
She was scared.

261
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,150
We're hoping we can do more.

262
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,950
You worked with my Stephanie?

263
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,870
She sent me this.

264
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,500
I got it in the mail on the day she died.

265
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,180
What does this mean?

266
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,640
I don't know.

267
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,510
I tried dialing the numbers.

268
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,930
The Police have no idea.

269
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,690
Where did Stephanie go to college?

270
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,520
Why are we here again?

271
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,780
Those numbers
on Stephanie Chan's postcard

272
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,690
are actually a call number for a book.

273
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,360
Call numbers start with letters.

274
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,700
In the Library of Congress, yeah.

275
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,450
In Harvard Yenching, it's a 
classification for Asian literature.

276
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,000
How could you possibly know that?

277
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,380
You speak Chinese?

278
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,150
Unbelievable!

279
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,380
It's a hit list.

280
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Hank Maestriano died 2 weeks ago.
Car crash.

281
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,580
Daniel McGinty. Heart attack. Last week.

282
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,120
But if this is a hit list,

283
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,540
why is this guy still alive? 
Gabriel Singer.

284
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,760
Flies cargo planes.

285
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,140
That's a good question.

286
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,610
Hell of a mess.

287
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,400
Come on ...

288
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,040
Joe Matheson, please.

289
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,790
Hold on.

290
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
Marna.

291
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,050
Hello?

292
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,650
What?

293
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Joe ...

294
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,760
CIA headquarters,
Langley, Virginia

295
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,590
Sir... SIR!

296
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,340
Frank Moses was never a target analyst
He's never worked in the field.

297
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,800
This guy has a history.

298
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,860
That's a file number.

299
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,780
You need to visit the back room.

300
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,320
You're going to meet the Records Keeper.

301
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,960
I didn't even know this place existed.

302
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,880
It doesn't.

303
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,390
Ahh.

304
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,230
Frank Moses' file.

305
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
You got to be kidding me.

306
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,910
Frank Moses was one of the most effective
black ops agent we've ever had.

307
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,080
He retired drug lords, terrorists.

308
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
hell he ..., he toppled governments.

309
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,720
Yeah. He was truly gifted.

310
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,050
Why was he retired?

311
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,430
He got old.

312
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,640
Then some thumb sucker came along
and tagged him "RED."

313
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,680
Red?

314
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:01,770
Yeah. RED. you know R..E..D
"Retired - Extremely Dangerous."

315
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,440
Yeah...

316
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,440
Yeah.
They don't make them like that anymore.

317
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,450
Thanks.

318
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm going to need a data haunt.

319
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,660
Every flak he was ever involved in.
Every agent he's ever run.

320
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,620
I want NSA telephone surveillance,
voice recognition the whole goddamn ...

321
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,800
We have to find Marvin Boggs.
His name is on the list too.
354

322
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,220
Marvin died two years ago in a fire.

323
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,220
Yeah. Marvin has died many times.

324
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,970
Oh, can we have that one?

325
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,250
Wow. All we need is a banjo.

326
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,670
Shhh, shhh. 
Keep your voice down.

327
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,960
Don't make any sudden moves.

328
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,010
Just stay close to me.

329
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,340
- Don't use your cell phone.
- You took my cell phone.

330
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,430
Don't talk about cell phones.
Don't talk about satellites.

331
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,560
Seriously?

332
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,850
Why are you trying to kill me?

333
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,770
I'm not trying to kill you!

334
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,940
Oh, yeah. You are.

335
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,440
Why would I be trying to kill you?

336
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,070
Because the last time we met,
I tried to kill you.

337
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,360
That was a long time ago.

338
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,860
Some people hold on to things like that.

339
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,660
I'm not trying to kill you.

340
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,160
Okay?

341
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,370
So that makes us friends.

342
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,710
Right?

343
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
Right.

344
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,880
Good.

345
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,460
You want to take that knife
out of my balls now?

346
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,800
Who is she?

347
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,470
Sarah. She's not trying to kill you either.

348
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,890
Yeah... Hi.

349
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,480
I don't stay in the open.

350
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,520
Come on, I'll show you the house.

351
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,900
What's that?

352
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,070
Decoy.

353
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,240
He lives in a car?

354
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,080
Come on in.

355
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,590
Why do you live here
when you have the other place?

356
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,560
So, Let's put it this way.

357
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,930
When the helicopter passed over
the house last year

358
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,270
and I could feel their eyes on me.

359
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,070
Wet like peaches.

360
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,950
I have a list here...

361
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,070
It was written by a Herald reporter
who is now dead.

362
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,780
Along with everyone whose names
are on that list.

363
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,490
Well, almost everyone.

364
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,370
Frank, how many times have I told you?

365
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,630
You cannot trust the system!

366
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,960
I told you when you're in the system,
they switch the flip and you're done.

367
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,760
Man, satellites, cell phones,

368
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,220
chips, net, the web, the dentist...

369
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,470
Marvin!

370
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,770
That list is the one we need help with.

371
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,310
Yeah, I got to check the files.

372
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,820
Of course you do. Thanks, man.

373
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,450
Wow.

374
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,490
This guy's insane.

375
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,750
Well, he thought he was the subject of
a secret government mind control project.

376
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,000
This'll take a minute.

377
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,460
Sure.

378
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,590
As it turns out,

379
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,010
he really was being given daily doses
of LSD for 11 years.

380
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,350
- Well, in that case, he looks great. Yeah.
- Fantastic.

381
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,390
Got it. Guatemala. Fall 1981.

382
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,900
Five of the guys on this list
were there, not including us.

383
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,650
Uh, San Benito. Just outside.

384
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,150
Injun territory.

385
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,280
Yeah. It was a little village.
Uh, Everybody was killed civilians and ...

386
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,120
They told us, "Go in there. Clean it up"...

387
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,990
"Make it look like it never happened."

388
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,750
You think everyone on this list was there?

389
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,500
Damn it.

390
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,040
Damn it!

391
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,790
Do you know what's wrong
with this country?

392
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,010
They're all trying to kill us?

393
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,550
Exactly!

394
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,550
Is there anybody still alive on that list?

395
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,640
Gabriel Singer.

396
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,010
Frank!

397
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,850
I never thought I'd say this again.

398
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,850
I am getting the pig!

399
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,360
Who's she talking to?

400
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,070
Just take it easy.

401
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,240
Frank, we got to get rid of this broad.

402
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,040
I know a great place, just up the road.
Lots of alligators.

403
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,080
We're not getting rid of the broad.

404
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,040
I like her. Okay?

405
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,670
What's the angle?

406
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,960
No angle. I like her.

407
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,430
Okay. So, they pull her voice
from the pay phone,

408
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,100
probably right now,

409
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,350
install the recognition software
and back trace it to Singer.

410
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,480
So then we show up,
they bring out the satellite,

411
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
and we're fried with Y-rays.

412
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,270
How you doing?

413
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,280
Good, fine.

414
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,370
November niner 745.

415
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,000
Wow, Singer is going to be
in Mobile tomorrow.

416
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,790
But we can catch him at the 
airfreight terminal.

417
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,170
How about that?

418
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,100
The Sunset Limited
with service to New Orleans,

419
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,640
Houston, Tucson and Los Angeles
now boarding platform five.

420
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,060
It's the final boarding call
for the eastbound express...

421
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Oh my God! Please don't...

422
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,160
No, please! No!

423
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,870
You smell like Washington.

424
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
Who do you work for?

425
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,830
Coldwell Banker, I'm a real estate agent!
Just take the money, Please, don't hurt me.

426
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,910
No, no. Who do you work for?

427
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,710
- What?
- Who do you work for?

428
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,750
Marvin! Whoa!

429
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,880
Frank, she's one of them.
She's been following us.

430
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,130
There's a camera in her bag.
I'm going to kill her now.

431
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,680
Wait a second, please don't kill...
Don't let him kill me! Please!

432
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,180
Marvin, just wait, would you, please?

433
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,890
Marvin. Look. Marvin.

434
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,640
No camera in the bag.

435
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,520
Go, ma'am, now. Now.

436
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,940
Get a car.

437
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,700
Try not to kill anyone.

438
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,450
She was following us, Frank.

439
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,800
Sorry.
This is great.

440
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,720
"She has a camera in her purse,
we have to kill her?"

441
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,810
Seriously?

442
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,600
See you in a minute.

443
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,740
Gabriel?

444
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,490
Right? Gabriel Singer?

445
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,200
What's this about?

446
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,040
Guatemala. 1981. San Benito.

447
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,200
I can't talk to you.

448
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,500
Pair beats ace.

449
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,260
I got one for you.

450
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,840
What did this twice decorated,
west Texas Jew boy Marine pilot...

451
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,140
say to the Chinese
New York Times reporter?

452
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,260
I give up.

453
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,310
Nothing. I didn't tell her a damn thing.

454
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,850
The reporter's dead now.

455
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,480
And everyone she spoke to is
either dead or a target.

456
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,860
And that includes you.

457
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,780
Oh, Christ.

458
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,410
They had me fly this guy out there
in the dead of night.

459
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,370
Hairy little airstrip in 
the middle of nowhere.

460
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,000
He was CIA, some dorky little
spook in a suit and tie.

461
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,250
Remember that guy?

462
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,040
- Black glasses.
- Yeah. He was giving the orders.

463
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,130
He picked up a package
and I flew him back out.

464
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,210
What was the package?

465
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,630
It wasn't a what.

466
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,880
It was a who.

467
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,090
Frank... Frank, FRANK!

468
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,800
It's that helicopter.

469
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,100
We're in an airport. So...

470
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,810
It's the same helicopter.

471
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:04,310
November Niner 748 Charlie.

472
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,230
November niner 748 Charlie.

473
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,780
See? Frank, November Niner 748...

474
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,910
Is that a 4?

475
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,320
This is a 4. Charlie.

476
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,450
Is that a 7? What is that?

477
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,080
I'll tell you what it is.

478
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,220
I told you she shouldn't
have made that phone call!

479
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,340
We lost visual on target.

480
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,930
All right. Shake the tree.

481
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,260
- You'll pay for the breakage?
- Yeah, Roger that.

482
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,120
That's right, old man!

483
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,170
- Old man?
- No respect.

484
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,420
Can I kill her now?

485
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,060
She called me an old man.

486
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,020
Pig! Open the pig!

487
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,230
Okay, head down.

488
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,080
Grenade!

489
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,920
Damn satellites!

490
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,300
Boop to that!

491
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,050
Yeah, you just stay right there.

492
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,220
This is going to be good.

493
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,860
- You okay?
- Yeah.

494
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,120
Come on, come on. Hey. All right?

495
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,580
What are you doing?

496
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,200
Old man, my ass.

497
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,370
God damn it!

498
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,160
- Smoke and thermals. Obstructed view.
- Signal's fading.

499
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,170
Nice shot.

500
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,040
- Thanks.
- We should get out of here.

501
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,320
You really know how to show a girl
a good time, Frank.

502
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,030
I will kill you, Marvin.

503
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,860
Take it easy, man. She likes you.

504
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,500
How can you tell?

505
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,170
Notice how she sticks around?

506
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,590
Because if a woman don't like you,
they don't stick around.

507
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,050
She doesn't really have 
much of a choice, does she?

508
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,590
Sure she does.

509
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,890
Really?

510
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,720
You think so?

511
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,150
You know, if it is the CIA,

512
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,520
Then there is only one
place that we can go

513
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,740
to find out why they're coming after us.

514
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,860
Yeah.

515
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,280
We're going to get killed there, for sure.

516
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,320
In or out?

517
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,290
No, of course I'm in, it's just
I'm staying.

518
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,420
We're going to need some serious help.

519
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,590
This is not the kind of help I meant, Frank.

520
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,380
You're not actually going to go in there,
are you?

521
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,640
I don't think I can go, Frank.

522
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,930
The last time they put
some electrical wires...

523
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,230
in some not very nice places.

524
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,320
Listen, hang onto that for me.

525
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,240
I'll be right back.

526
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,330
Hey.

527
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,170
Be careful.

528
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,660
Tell Ivan Simanov that Frank Moses is...

529
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,870
Frank Moses is here to see him.

530
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,300
I have to say

531
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,050
this is the last thing I expected

532
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,140
when I got up this morning.

533
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,610
I have many times dreamed of killing you.

534
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,450
But now ...

535
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,330
you are

536
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,620
... a pensioner...

537
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,580
Couple of years now.

538
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,710
Time passes.

539
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,590
As we get older,
things seem less important.

540
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,260
Still ...

541
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,550
I owe you

542
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:54,060
for killing Igor.

543
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,520
- Igor the Butcher?
- He was a great asset.

544
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,600
- He was a pig.
- He was my cousin.

545
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,900
I'm sorry.

546
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,080
To Igor.

547
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,410
The Butcher.

548
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,910
He's not dead.

549
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,830
I flipped him.

550
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,960
No ...

551
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,380
He owns a string of 7-Elevens
in Orange County.

552
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,550
- Asshole!

553
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:29,840
He weighs 500 pounds.

554
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,440
Drink.

555
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,030
Who are we drinking to now?

556
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,610
Veronique.

557
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,160
She was mine.

558
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,950
- Impossible.
- Yes!

559
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,630
Whatever she got, it was worth it.

560
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,680
I miss the old days.

561
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,640
I haven't killed anyone in years.

562
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,770
That's sad.

563
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,150
But,

564
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,660
I think you are not here for the vodka.

565
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,200
I'm going to break into the CIA.

566
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,920
I need your complete
security layout of Langley.

567
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,670
Cracks, Codes, ID swipes ...

568
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,760
All of it.

569
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,930
Amusing as this would be,

570
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:59,930
it is beyond my reach.

571
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,320
A favor from Frank Moses?

572
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,290
I can't believe you're actually
letting me come along.

573
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,960
The badges Ivan gave us
are for a General Harlow...

574
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,170
and a female nuclear physicist
from Los Alamos.

575
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,420
Sheniqua Johnson?

576
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,430
You're adopted.

577
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,760
Okay.

578
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,230
This is so, cool!

579
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,240
Please initiate scan.

580
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,700
- What?
- Uh-oh, I...

581
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,250
I dropped it.

582
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,170
Freeze!

583
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,260
The General has dropped his contact lens.

584
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,350
Perhaps you'd like to help us.

585
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,850
Sorry.

586
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,650
Found it! I found it!

587
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,240
I found it.

588
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,330
Have a good day, sir.

589
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,090
Gentlemen.

590
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,300
Oh my God!

591
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:00,220
What do you suppose the punishment
is for what we're doing here?

592
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,140
Death.

593
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:04,640
Maybe life in prison.

594
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,220
Awesome.

595
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,820
Why are you holding that button?

596
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,580
The Russians give you the code?

597
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,200
No.

598
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,420
Changes every six hours.

599
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,130
Will you hold that for me for a second?

600
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,210
Yeah.

601
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,170
It's unbreakable.

602
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,720
Wow.

603
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,850
Come on.

604
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,950
Mr. Moses.

605
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,990
It's been a long time.

606
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:09,500
I'm going to need to see that,
Guatemala file.	

607
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,000
Guatemala?

608
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,960
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

609
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,540
I think I can help you.

610
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:17,840
Great.

611
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,050
You know, It's been a whole new world
around here since you left.

612
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,220
Guatemala.

613
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,100
You know, you're going to
catch hell for this.

614
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:35,810
After what I've seen?

615
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,730
Oh, I should tell you ...

616
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:43,200
there's a new guy came down here
yesterday looking for your file.

617
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,120
Name of William Cooper?

618
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,240
6'1"? Cute hair?

619
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,540
Hair was cute.

620
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,000
But I thought he looked a little tough,
though.

621
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,920
You take good care of yourself, Henry.

622
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,130
You, too, Mr. Moses.

623
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,300
Change of plan.

624
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,610
Bad move, Grandpa.

625
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,380
I'm back in the saddle again ]

626
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,800
Just looks completely
different than his profile picture.

627
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,240
Kordesky trained you?

628
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,410
Yeah.

629
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,000
I trained Kordesky.

630
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:39,850
Son of a bitch!

631
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,030
Seal the building. Bald, white male, 50s,

632
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,570
wearing white shirt, blue pants,
shot in the shoulder.

633
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:58,830
Hi.

634
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,460
We should go.

635
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,290
We should go now.

636
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,620
I've got checkpoints at every exit.
What about the fire?

637
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,330
Shut off the alarm.
I told you, there is no fire!

638
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,000
- We need to evacuate.
- No, this is just a diversion.

639
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,790
You make sure everyone gets checked.

640
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:48,260
Help, help! Please come!

641
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,720
I can't stop the bleeding.

642
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,600
You okay, sir?

643
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,100
Make a hole!

644
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,890
Make a hole!

645
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,650
Whoa! Hold it. Let me see him.

646
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,940
It's not him.

647
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,070
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

648
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,030
Fellas, help me out, here.

649
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,920
Marvin?

650
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,390
There's still something wrong
with this guy's head, Frank.

651
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:42,440
You're really something, Joe.

652
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,480
Marvin, you okay?

653
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,150
I don't want to talk about it.

654
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,120
Joe? Joe who was dead Joe?

655
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:58,530
- She with us?
- Yeah.

656
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,040
Not dead.

657
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,330
Just retired.

658
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,760
I guess calling wasn't an option, huh?

659
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,670
- Can we go?
- Yeah!

660
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,050
You let yourself get shot?

661
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,100
God damn it.

662
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,760
Out.

663
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,140
- You okay?
- Thanks, Doc.

664
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,640
What did he get?

665
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,610
I have no idea.

666
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,690
You just had your ass handed
to you by a goddamn retiree.

667
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,160
What did he do?

668
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,870
What did Moses do to earn a lethal finding?

669
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,160
I have not been read into it.

670
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,380
I like you, Cooper.
You're ambitious and you get results,

671
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,500
but someone just kicked in
the front door of our house,

672
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:52,710
so you better get your shit straight.

673
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,380
Nothing in your mission is changed.

674
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,800
- You're still bleeding.
- Mmm-hmm.

675
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,390
Must have nicked something in there.

676
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,310
This is so bad.

677
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:07,400
It's not that bad.
People get shot all the time.

678
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,770
No, they don't, they get paper cuts.

679
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,110
I mostly get shot.

680
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,150
Well we're going to have to find
somebody to plug this leak.

681
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,910
Could go to Eagle's Nest.

682
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,290
Huh?

683
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,950
Then we all get shot.

684
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,080
I'll just go in by myself.

685
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,080
Want a vest?

686
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:33,710
Wouldn't do any good.

687
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,630
Frank Moses.

688
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,250
Hi, Victoria.

689
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,930
Are you here to kill me?

690
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,220
No.

691
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:28,640
You've been shot.

692
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,570
Tell Marvin to stand down
before he gets hurt.

693
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,000
Who's the girl?

694
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,500
She's with me.

695
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,500
- Vicky.
- Joe!

696
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,550
Oh, Vicky. Sexy as ever.

697
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:02,510
Oh you old, snake charmer you.

698
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,510
Sarah, this is Victoria.
Best wet work asset in the business.

699
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,100
And a true artist with an RPM.

700
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,730
What's that?

701
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:13,850
I kill people, dear.

702
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:18,320
You were lucky.

703
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,830
How'd you do it?

704
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,160
- What?
- How'd you make the transition?

705
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,830
Here you seem so calm. At ease.

706
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,340
I love it.

707
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,920
I love it here. I love the baking...
I love the flower arranging, I like...

708
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,050
I like the routine.

709
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,560
Well I...

710
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,600
- I do get a bit restless sometimes.
- Mmm-hmm.

711
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,610
I take the odd contract on the side.

712
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:03,650
I... I just can't stop.

713
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,620
Yeah. Tell me about it.

714
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,160
You can't just flip a switch
and become someone else.

715
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,790
Put some pressure on it.

716
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,420
So...

717
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,380
Tell me about your lady friend.

718
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,800
Makes me think that I could actually

719
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,470
...have a life.

720
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,810
A real life.

721
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:36,190
Oh, Francis, you're such a romantic.

722
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,520
What?

723
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,860
A romantic.
It's why I've always been so fond of you.

724
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,940
Victoria...

725
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,690
You're all hard on the outside,
but you are...

726
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,660
You are gooey on the inside.

727
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,120
Gooey.

728
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:57,210
The entire back half of the Guatemala file
has been blacked out.

729
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,050
But there's a list. 11 names.
Plus one that's been redacted.

730
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,840
All dead. Except for Frank and Marvin.

731
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:07,840
All the names on the reporter's list
are in the file, too,

732
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,850
but she has an additional name.

733
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,470
Alexander Dunning.

734
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,720
Somebody's protecting him.

735
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,270
Dunning is the CEO of Browning-Orvis.

736
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,480
Gangsters.

737
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,070
Defense contractor.

738
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,530
Very connected.

739
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:27,150
You know, if the CIA is protecting him,

740
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,370
he's under surveillance.

741
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,780
We could go see him.

742
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,330
You're not going without me.

743
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:33,830
Well...

744
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,670
We're getting the band back together.
That's nice.

745
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,400
Yeah?

746
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,030
We just got a tip. RED has a new target.

747
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,700
A tip?

748
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:09,990
FBI's on the scene.

749
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,490
I'm on my way.

750
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:26,210
The FBI has a lookout
position on the east perimeter.

751
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,010
Copy that.

752
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,240
Alexander Dunning.

753
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,080
Pleasure to see you, Secretary Baptiste.

754
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,950
The pleasure is with me.

755
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,080
They're in.

756
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,760
Frank said you wanted me with you.

757
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:10,880
Yes, I thought it might be nice
to have a bit of girl time together.

758
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:13,930
You know, get to know each other.

759
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,230
And I just wanted to tell you that
in all the years I've known Francis,

760
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:22,770
I've never seen him like this.

761
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:27,570
So if you break his heart,

762
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,240
I will kill you.

763
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,570
And bury your body in the woods.

764
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,620
Wow.

765
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,830
Okay.

766
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,620
Oh, this is going to be fun.

767
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,840
Here at Browning-Orvis,

768
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:52,170
we have a longstanding commitment
to humanitarian causes

769
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,800
because exemplary corporate citizenship
is our highest calling.

770
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:00,680
As a company with global reach
and global interests,

771
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:03,810
we have global responsibilities.

772
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,560
Now sometimes I'm asked,

773
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:10,990
if this commitment to ethical behavior
affects the bottom line.

774
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,990
And my answer is always the same.

775
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,240
Yes.

776
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,910
It makes it stronger.

777
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,120
This is my safe room.
Sound proofed. Reinforced.

778
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:24,210
Swept for bugs daily.

779
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,040
You could fire a gun in here.

780
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,000
No one would ever know.

781
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:30,090
Mr. Dunning.

782
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:35,340
I cannot imagine a more perfect place
to conduct our business.

783
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,310
You do know that there's

784
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,230
a surcharge

785
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,810
for any arms deliveries

786
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,360
to countries that are embargoed
by the United Nations.

787
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,690
For every problem, monsieur,

788
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,110
there is a solution.

789
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:01,080
Excuse me.

790
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,540
Mmm-hmm.

791
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:07,880
What are...

792
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:11,300
How many CEOs can say that?

793
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,880
So how did you guys meet?

794
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,340
We started talking on the phone.

795
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:21,600
I guess I liked that it wasn't real.

796
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:24,480
Of course now I'm a fugitive,

797
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,270
the CIA wants to kill me
and I'm hiding in a hole.

798
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,400
You know, I was in love with an agent once.

799
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:34,900
What happened?

800
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,320
Well I was with MI6,

801
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,370
and the relationship wasn't

802
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:42,530
sanctioned.

803
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,790
So when it came to light,
my loyalty was questioned.

804
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,420
And I was ordered to kill him.

805
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,210
It was a test.

806
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:53,750
What did you do?

807
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,630
I put three bullets in his chest.

808
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:59,680
Okay.

809
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,350
Who the hell are you guys?

810
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,890
You don't remember us?

811
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,270
We remember you.

812
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:12,110
You're the guy whose shit we cleaned up
down in Guatemala in 1981.

813
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:18,990
And the question is,
who did you fly out of there?

814
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,870
You don't have any idea
what you're getting into.

815
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,910
First of all,

816
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:27,580
you can't touch me.

817
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,000
Sure, we can.

818
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:42,340
Oh, yeah.

819
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,760
Where'd you get this?

820
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:45,310
Home Depot.

821
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,100
- How much?
- Ten bucks.

822
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,890
You want nuts?

823
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,400
Nipples?

824
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,650
Potty trainer?

825
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,820
All right, stop it.

826
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,070
Nuts.

827
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,030
Stop it. For the love of Christ, stop it!

828
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,490
Stop already!

829
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,660
Now you got something to say?

830
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,290
We extracted a young lieutenant

831
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,420
who is the son of the late Senator,

832
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,010
James Stanton.

833
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,340
Robert Stanton?

834
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:25,800
Vice President of the United States.

835
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,810
You're saying the Vice President
killed all the people in that village?

836
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:32,690
Yeah. Went completely off the reservation.

837
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,810
And that New York Times reporter?

838
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,650
Did she pressure you?

839
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,230
Yeah. She called me. Twice.

840
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,400
So I called the V.P.

841
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:44,410
And what did you think
would happen then?

842
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,030
Oh, whatever.

843
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,200
I made him Vice President.

844
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,500
You kept your mouth shut
and the Stantons made you rich.

845
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,670
We have been working with

846
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:54,790
our partners in the developing world

847
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,340
to root out corruption and...

848
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,300
Okay.

849
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:05,220
I will pay whatever it costs

850
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,180
to get rid of this thing.

851
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,430
We're not here for your money, home.

852
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,270
We're here because that New York Times
reporter had the list of names

853
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,690
of everybody who was in Guatemala.

854
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,980
And everybody on that list
has been ordered killed.

855
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,320
Except you.

856
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,610
I had nothing to do with that.

857
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,200
Don't you see?

858
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:33,790
He's trying to clean up his past
and get rid of me in one shot.

859
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:37,670
He's trying to cut me loose
before he runs for President.

860
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,960
We have some
major activity out here.

861
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,670
Looks like we're blown.

862
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,940
We're in position.
Perimeter's set. No one's getting out.

863
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,780
They're moving a team up the east side.

864
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,410
Are you going to let me talk to them?

865
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:10,530
- 
- I can negotiate something.

866
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,500
Thanks, when we want your help,
we'll get out the drain cleaner.

867
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,790
Listen, Plastic Man,

868
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:19,380
those bastards out there
probably have orders to kill me, too.

869
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,630
I hope so.

870
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:24,260
Why? 'Cause I'm a bad guy?

871
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:26,430
I'm scum?

872
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,090
Can I just shoot him now?

873
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,470
No.

874
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,140
You don't have people killed.

875
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:36,810
I have people killed,
I'm the bad guy. Remember?

876
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,820
Not worth a bullet.

877
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,120
Hello?

878
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:54,580
How's retirement, Frank?

879
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,660
It's been a real blast.

880
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:59,210
If we have to come in there and get you,
it's going to be messy.

881
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,090
You bet. Real messy.

882
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,090
I've got my orders, Frank.

883
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,010
They come from the Vice President.

884
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,970
He's ordered these hits to cover up
the war crimes he committed in Guatemala.

885
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,640
Well I find that hard to believe.

886
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,850
How did you know you'd find me here?

887
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:16,270
Some anonymous untraceable tip?

888
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,020
Here's the deal, Frank.

889
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,360
You're going to walk out that front door
and give yourself up.

890
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,730
You have my word no one
will shoot you.

891
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:29,570
I'll personally take you in and you will
get to tell your side of the story.

892
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,410
You got 60 seconds to decide.

893
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,580
What's it look like?

894
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,210
There's no clean exit...

895
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,790
.... They seem to be coming from everywhere.
We're running out of options.

896
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:50,380
If we had a distraction,
I could cover you to the woods.

897
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:05,860
Looks like there's not a lot
of options, kid.

898
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,030
I mean

899
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:14,160
somebody's going to have to make
the hard choice

900
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,580
if we are going to get out of here alive.

901
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,760
Been wild.

902
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,050
Wild and crazy.

903
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,600
But I wouldn't want it any other way.

904
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,280
An honor.

905
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:56,780
Good luck.

906
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,460
Tell your men to hold their fire.

907
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,000
I'm coming out.

908
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,470
He's coming out. All units, hold fire.

909
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,550
Repeat, all units, hold fire.

910
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,970
Roger that.

911
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,810
Get behind.

912
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,480
Come out now.
I've got you covered.

913
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,540
Who fired the shot?

914
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,570
Tell me when the boys
make cover, we'll move.

915
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:16,610
Now.

916
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,690
They've got Sarah.

917
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,870
Frank, you're no good to her dead.

918
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,280
We got to move.

919
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:05,450
Come!

920
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,670
Now is not time to waste.

921
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:10,460
Ivan?

922
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,090
Zaychick Moy.

923
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,460
It's nice to see you again, Ivan.

924
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:17,920
Did he just call you "bunny"?

925
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,550
Life sometimes is complicated.

926
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:23,930
Quickly.

927
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,060
To Joe.

928
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,730
To Joe.

929
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:49,410
Not to push the bounds of propriety,

930
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,370
but don't you think
we ought to discuss the fact that

931
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:55,250
the CIA's being used by the Vice
President as his personal hit squad

932
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:58,670
and that they'll do whatever they can
to find us and kill us?

933
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,090
Options?

934
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:05,760
We could go public.

935
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:10,270
Yeah, right. That didn't work
very well for the reporter.

936
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,400
And what about Frank's girlfriend?

937
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:14,190
They'll kill her so fast.

938
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:18,530
First they'll interrogate her.
They probably already got the wires.

939
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:21,860
Then give her a little snorkel.
Give her a jump.

940
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:23,660
- Bring in the dent.
- Marvin!

941
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:28,290
God! You are such an idiot.

942
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,180
I want to show you something.

943
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,890
This was done to me by 
the love of my life.

944
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,020
It seems that what we had
was not meant to be.

945
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:00,440
But now she sits

946
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,360
outside my house ...

947
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,910
...drinking vodka.

948
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,540
Three bullets in the chest.

949
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:17,130
When I woke alive,

950
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:21,090
I knew she still loved me.

951
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,220
Or else it would have been the head.

952
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:28,140
It was big risk for her, of course,

953
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:33,390
but one does crazy things for love.

954
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,400
Do not fear for your love, my friend.

955
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:42,400
With a small dedicated group,

956
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:45,410
there is nothing
that cannot be accomplished.

957
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,030
Let me be blunt.

958
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:51,410
Nobody knows you're here. You don't exist.

959
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,960
And unless you cooperate fully,

960
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,420
there's nothing I can't do to you.

961
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,920
- Sir.
- Not now.

962
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,750
Moses is on the phone.

963
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,630
Okay. Trace is running.

964
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,640
Moses.

965
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,560
Here's the thing, Cooper.

966
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:18,270
With age comes a certain perspective.

967
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,860
I'd be a liar if I said there wasn't a time
when I was exactly like you.

968
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,740
Blind ambition.

969
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,400
Misplaced trust.

970
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:28,370
Why are you telling me this?

971
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:31,280
It might help me to decide
what to do next.

972
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:32,450
Just keep it going.

973
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,250
Why? What are you thinking about?

974
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,960
Our business is a very hard one.

975
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,790
But it was never

976
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,000
the killing or the stress,

977
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,920
or the bad pay that bothered me.

978
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:46,130
What was it, Frank?

979
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:49,430
It's how anything that you love

980
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,510
can be taken away from you.

981
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:54,600
It taught me never to care.

982
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,140
Never to invest.

983
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,650
Then I met this woman.

984
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,820
Sarah.

985
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:05,690
And now you have her.

986
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,280
Now I can't think of anything
more horrible

987
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:13,160
than to know that your enemies
can hurt someone that you love.

988
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,500
The feeling is almost indescribable.

989
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:24,130
You still there, Cooper?

990
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:27,340
You're at my house.

991
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:37,770
Almost indescribable, isn't it?

992
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:41,770
Please ...

993
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,280
Please don't hurt my family.

994
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,190
If anything happens to Sarah,

995
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,530
I will rip everything you love
out of your life.

996
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,490
And then I'll kill you.

997
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:59,040
I swear to you, I will keep Sarah safe.

998
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,210
We don't have much time.

999
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:02,750
Do you understand that?

1000
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:07,420
What are you going to do, Frank?

1001
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,090
I'm going to kill the Vice President.

1002
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:11,930
What are you going to do?

1003
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,230
Move! Move!

1004
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,610
Mom!

1005
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,760
Frank left this for me.

1006
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:40,470
Where did he get it from?

1007
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:45,140
The secure records depository of the CIA.

1008
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,660
Look, Sarah ...

1009
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:02,000
I know Frank's been right
about a few things.

1010
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,210
But he's about to cross a line
from which there is no turning back.

1011
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:10,840
Right now,
you have an opportunity to help him.

1012
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:14,220
You need to tell me
everything you know.

1013
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,680
Because if I can't stop him,

1014
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,600
I'm going to have to kill him.

1015
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:30,480
Do you know who Frank Moses is?
I mean, really is?

1016
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,230
Do you know what he's done?

1017
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:36,820
Wow.

1018
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:41,950
You're asking me for help?
That is so lame.

1019
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,830
He's going to eat you for lunch.

1020
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,210
She's never going to trust us.

1021
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:57,220
I can't blame her. The tip off was a trap.

1022
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:59,720
Someone's got us dancing like marionettes.

1023
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,520
Just like Moses called it.

1024
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,520
Yeah.

1025
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,110
He will take a shot at the V.P.

1026
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,900
That's a problem for the Secret Service.

1027
01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:20,820
Moses will take them apart.

1028
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:23,580
Plug me into their detail.

1029
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:26,700
You got it.

1030
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:28,620
What about her?

1031
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:32,880
I'll keep her close. Protected. Off the grid.

1032
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,300
I put a few things away.

1033
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,600
Just in case, you know.

1034
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,720
Frank ...

1035
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,230
Swedish K.

1036
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:56,730
Now that is exciting.

1037
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,240
Explosives?

1038
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:01,950
Just past the RPGs.

1039
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:03,780
I love you, man.

1040
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:07,410
- Make yourself at home.
- The Vice President's going to love this.

1041
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,590
Nice to see you, too.

1042
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,420
Thank you.

1043
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,680
Oh. I'm sorry.

1044
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:11,850
Sorry. Silly.

1045
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:15,730
Thank you, ma'am.

1046
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,580
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

1047
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,710
Welcome, Ms. Brown.

1048
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:43,300
Mmm-hmm.

1049
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:46,340
It's a pleasure to have you
at our Victory Fund Gala.

1050
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,550
Oh, I'm so looking forward to it.

1051
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,890
Raptor is cleared for entry.

1052
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,400
After you, Mr. Vice President.

1053
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:02,400
A true war hero,
a fabulous friend and a wonderful leader.

1054
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:06,450
And so it's with great pleasure
I introduce to you,

1055
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:09,200
vice President Robert Stanton.

1056
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:14,080
I love you, sir!

1057
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:20,750
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you so much for being here.

1058
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:22,420
I'm going to keep this short and sweet

1059
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,670
so you'll actually write those checks
you've been promising.

1060
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,010
Seriously, though, great to see you all.

1061
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:34,230
It's the wonderful people here tonight

1062
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:36,060
that got us into the White House
in the first place.

1063
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:38,350
And I believe
it's this wonderful group of people

1064
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,570
who will keep us there
for a long, long time!

1065
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:45,780
My good friends,

1066
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:48,700
I am proud to announce that I will
be forming an exploratory committee

1067
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:52,370
with the primary goal of seeking
a nomination for the Presidency.

1068
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:05,130
We've had a great journey together.

1069
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:09,340
But I firmly believe
that the best is still to come.

1070
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,680
God bless you all.

1071
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:13,760
And God bless America.

1072
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:34,200
Mmm?

1073
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,500
Hello, bunny.

1074
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,080
Moves like that could get you killed.

1075
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:46,380
Your radiance tonight
renders me almost speechless.

1076
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,510
Almost.

1077
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,050
What are you grinning at?

1078
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:57,220
I've always dreamed
of killing an American President.

1079
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:58,520
Vice President.

1080
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,020
Hmm, whatever.

1081
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,230
Having you in my arms once again,
I get carried away.

1082
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,530
Really?

1083
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,320
Tell me you love me.

1084
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:13,950
It's been a long time, Ivan.

1085
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:15,790
Blink of an eye.

1086
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:20,460
- Ivan.
- Mmm?

1087
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:22,380
The music has stopped.

1088
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:24,540
Has it?

1089
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,130
Ah.

1090
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,220
To work then.

1091
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,680
Ivan!

1092
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,110
Do you smell that?

1093
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:18,060
- This area is off limits.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

1094
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:19,390
You'll have to turn around.

1095
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,100
No, no, no, no it's fine.

1096
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,310
It's all right. I'm sure I'm allowed.

1097
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,480
You'll have to go back up, ma'am,
or I'll have to treat you as a threat.

1098
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,940
Where exactly is the threat?

1099
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,000
- Good to see you.
-

1100
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:50,380
Oh, my God!

1101
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,470
Gas! I smell gas!

1102
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:55,930
Gas! Gas!

1103
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:57,340
Gas!

1104
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:08,520
Stand aside.

1105
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,280
Primary exit blocked. Secondary, move.

1106
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,990
Move! Move! Move!

1107
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:22,040
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

1108
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,160
Go.

1109
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,380
What the hell are they using?

1110
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:33,070
Get back up in here
to the north stairwell, now!

1111
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,000
Ah, yes.

1112
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,430
Move to the other limo. I'll cover you.

1113
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,040
We have to go. Now! Now!

1114
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,630
Approaching target from the rear.

1115
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,570
Outside!

1116
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,080
Secret Service,
everybody down!

1117
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:33,100
Cover us! We're moving now!

1118
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:36,860
Come on! Move!

1119
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:37,980
Go!

1120
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:46,200
I remember
the Secret Service being tougher.

1121
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,450
Me, too.

1122
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,120
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1123
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:01,380
Marvin.

1124
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:05,720
Bugger! 
I got it!

1125
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:24,990
Ready to go.

1126
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:37,620
- Almost there.
- Marvin ...

1127
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:38,960
We got to move.

1128
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:43,090
You're on your own. I'm no use anymore.

1129
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:46,590
Good luck. Go on.

1130
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:52,510
Let's move!

1131
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,520
Are you hit, sir?

1132
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:58,100
- Are you hit?
- I'm fine! Just get me the hell out of here.

1133
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,540
- Perhaps I could be of assistance?
- 

1134
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:35,770
I love you.

1135
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,390
I know.

1136
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:45,900
Freeze!

1137
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:53,580
What the...

1138
01:35:57,290 --> 01:35:58,540
Go. Go!

1139
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:01,880
Go!

1140
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,140
Get in! Get in!

1141
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:16,930
Go, go, go!

1142
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:23,690
Stop the car! Stop...

1143
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:25,400
Don't you dare stop! You keep going!

1144
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,480
Stop the car! Pull over!

1145
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:37,870
I want to know
what the hell that was all about!

1146
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:00,270
- Burbacher!
- Get him off!

1147
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,060
Pull over!

1148
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:05,610
Raptor is secure.

1149
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:23,710
Who are you?

1150
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,750
One of the men you ordered killed.

1151
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,550
I don't know what you're talking about.

1152
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,470
Guatemala.

1153
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,180
I was there.

1154
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:41,850
Well...

1155
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:50,150
I'm sure we can negotiate something.

1156
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:52,360
Starting to come back to you now, is it?

1157
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,370
If you're looking for revenge...

1158
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,620
This is not about revenge.

1159
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:05,750
Are you going to kill me?

1160
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:09,630
Not just you.

1161
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:22,020
Yeah?

1162
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,140
I'm at the Evanston power plant.

1163
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,770
You have 15 minutes to bring me Sarah.

1164
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:29,110
Or I kill the vice President.

1165
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,320
He just made contact. He wants the girl.

1166
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:38,160
Evanston power station, 15 minutes.

1167
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:40,330
You better alert Secret Service.

1168
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,660
Copy that.

1169
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:44,790
Secret Service is en route.

1170
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:03,680
All right, come on.

1171
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,310
Where's Sarah?

1172
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:11,020
She's on her way.

1173
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:14,900
It's over, Frank.

1174
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:17,860
Any minute
the whole world is going to drop on you.

1175
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:20,280
We'll see.

1176
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,560
Hey, tough guy.

1177
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:49,650
Surprised to see me?

1178
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:52,360
What the hell is this

1179
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,520
Alex...

1180
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:57,740
Just give him what he wants.
I can't do this anymore.

1181
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,910
You ordered these killings, not me.

1182
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:06,540
I don't want to have
anything to do with this anymore.

1183
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:13,750
You shot me.

1184
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,170
Shut up.

1185
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:23,100
I loved watching you being a good guy.

1186
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:27,100
Kicking ass for your country.

1187
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:31,350
It showed a spectacular lack of vision.

1188
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:33,770
The girl goes free.

1189
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:36,150
That'll cost you a gun.

1190
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:43,120
A life for a life.

1191
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:49,450
I tore up all those checks.

1192
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,080
I know.

1193
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,960
I just wanted to talk to you.

1194
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:05,140
Cooper,

1195
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,470
cuff him.

1196
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,900
Wilkes told me you had promise.

1197
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:25,280
Okay, here's how it goes.

1198
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:27,990
Moses just shot the V.P.

1199
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:30,410
You kill him and the girl,

1200
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:33,170
and you're head of the CIA.

1201
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,080
Cooper.

1202
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:40,380
This is going to happen either way.

1203
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,340
Fuck you, Cynthia.

1204
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,570
Thanks.

1205
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:49,910
This going to be a problem?

1206
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:55,000
No.

1207
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,170
I got it...

1208
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:00,000
...Grandpa.

1209
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,430
Feel better now?

1210
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:13,770
Yeah.

1211
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:16,230
Want to get pancakes?

1212
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:21,980
Can you believe it? It all worked out.

1213
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:25,650
Something bad is going to happen very soon.

1214
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,490
Maybe not. Wait a second ...

1215
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,910
Nobody's chasing us.

1216
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,330
No one's trying to kill us.

1217
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:37,830
I think we just got our lives back.

1218
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:40,080
Almost.

1219
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:43,750
You still owe me a small favor.

1220
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:44,960
Oh, Ivan!

1221
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:47,630
His timing is terrible.

1222
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:50,220
You gave a favor to him?

1223
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:54,260
Just a tiny little nuclear problem
in Moldova.

1224
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,310
Can we go?

1225
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:02,610
Yes. We can go.

1226
01:44:33,390 --> 01:44:35,680
I told you something bad was
going to happen.

1227
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:37,220
Keep your skirt on Goldie locks.

1228
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:40,890
Moldova sucks.

1229
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:42,600
Moldova sucks!

1230
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:46,520
Next time,
your girlfriend can wear the dress.
