00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,319

of real estate in Long Island.

510
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,479

No, you didn't mention that.

511
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,808

never mentioned that.

512
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,919
I was gonna mention it, then the
guy with the hat walked in.

513
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,199
The hat?
You remember that?

514
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,880
I forgot, I totally...
I do remember.

515
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,799
It was the second
time we had lunch.

516
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,119
Yes. (CHUCKLES)

517
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,799
I thought he was...
You couldn't see his eyes.

518
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,359
It was like he had no eyes.

519
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,999
Do they sell hats like that?
I don't know.

520
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,559
It's like he made it.
Where do they come from?

521
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,599
He's a great milliner.
Actually, I went to the store.

522
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,919
I saw a hat store down the street.

523
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,079
I thought maybe he bought it there,

524
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,119
and I was gonna get you one,
as, like, a memento.

525
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,079
Two lunches?
SYDNEY: Yes.

526
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,519
Really?
It's two lunches.

527
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,399
What's the big deal?
That's unusual.

528
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,439
I was trying to get him
to be more aggressive.

529
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,599
On his loan, that is.

to run, and we need to do it now.

or Romania, I don't care,

the cash from the bed,

and get out of here, all right?

687
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,359
I adopted him, I gave him my name.

688
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,839
I'm not leaving him with Rosalyn.

689
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,559
She's unstable.
That is a manipulation.

690
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,079
Rosalyn will never let you go.

691
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,439
She'll use Danny
against you because

692
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,120
she's too messed
up to let you leave.

693
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,527
I can't leave him.
I love him, all right?

Yeah.

first-name basis with him?

Yes, I am. I'm not
even on your list, am I?

00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,719
I got to run. No, don't go...
No, don't go.

849
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,599
<i>the more you say no, the more
they want in on something.</i>

850
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,719
<i>Yeah, they're so stupid.</i>

851
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,879
I got to run. Come on.

852
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,799
I'll tell them. Don't worry.
Don't worry. I'll tell...

853
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,559
Hey, you know what
Carl just told me?

854
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,559
He said he could do this whole thing
with four guys within a week.

855
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,079
Or we could do something much bigger.
All right.

856
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,559
Something bigger?
Yeah, my guy deals

857
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,799
with hundreds of
millions of dollars.

858
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,199
How much bigger?
Hundreds of...

859
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,079
I knew you were
holding out on me, Irving!

860
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,479
Hundreds of millions of dollars?
Like, much bigger.

861
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,399
Like, I'm talking about, we could
say never the fuck mind the CDs,

862
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,519
and we could have some complete
access to something huge.

863
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,839
RICHIE: Huge? Like what?

CARL: Carl Elway.

866
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,919
I want you to think of
the most undervalued asset

867
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,043
in the state of New Jersey today.

868
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,006
The rebuilding of Atlantic City.

869
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,519
Look, maybe they... Maybe
they legalized gambling

870
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,679
a year ago...
Wow.

871
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,079
and nothing's happening.

872
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,759
Hey.
No licenses, no permits.

873
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,279
Quit while you're ahead, Carl.

874
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,919
I know the guy...
I know the right people

875
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,439
who are going to help you out.
Who's the guy?

876
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,359
The guy is Carmine Polito.

877
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,959
Who's Carmine Polito?

878
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,286
<i>Carmine Polito?</i>

879
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,119
Carmine Polito, no.

880
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,599
<i>RICHIE: My boss, Stoddard,
proceeded to tell me</i>

881
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,599
<i>that Carmine Polito was the
most quietly powerful person</i>

<i>which had become a ghetto.</i>

885
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,039
<i>And where he had been
mayor for ten years.</i>

886
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,879
<i>A very beloved guy.</i>

887
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,889
<i>A guy who never
gave up on his people.</i>

888
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,086
<i>His father had emigrated from
Italy and had stoked coal.</i>

<i>from the Boys and Girls Club

893

<i>I mean, his household

894
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,649
<i>And his wife, Dolly, well,
she was the apple of his eye.</i>

895
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,119
<i>And the center
of the household.</i>

896
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,800
<i>I mean,
everyone loved this guy.</i>

897
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,203
<i>And he had a huge heart.</i>

CARMINE: The WPA employed craftsmen
to paint this during the Depression.

899
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,599
Why can't we employ people today

00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,479
to do work like this
in rebuilding Atlantic City?

901
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,159
<i>RICHIE:
He worked with all the unions,</i>

902
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,959
<i>he was the leader of
the State Assembly,</i>

903
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,599
<i>and he had just
gotten gambling legalized</i>

<i>in New Jersey to create jobs.</i>

905
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,724
<i>But he couldn't get the funds
to rebuild Atlantic City.</i>

906
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,079
<i>And that was his problem.</i>

907
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,599
<i>So, with our help,
he was about to have his hand</i>

908
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,599
<i>in the wrong pocket
at the wrong time.</i>

909
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,962
<i>And to me, that meant corrupt.</i>

STODDARD:
You said grifters, con artists.

911
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,319
We're not going
after some politician.

912
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,239
This is a bad idea, Richard.

913
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,959
Look, it's really simple.

914
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,639
All you need is to put two
million in a Chase account...

915
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,439
What?
...under the sheik's name.

916
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,879
Whose $2 million?

917
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,839
Just listen.

918
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,439
$2 million under the sheik's name

919
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,759
in a Chase account that we control.

920
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,239
Carmine calls up on the telephone,

921
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,199
calls the bank and he sees
that the sheik is real

922
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,759
and he has a real account.

923
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,559
Five days.

924
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,599
I'm not taking $2 million
of the taxpayers' money,

925
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,679
putting it anywhere for five days.

926
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,239
I don't care if we
control it the whole time.

927
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,239
Stoddard, let us do what we need
to do to rule out corruption

928
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,439
and to get rid of the payoff guys

929
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,559
that are ruining this country.
That's my dream.

930
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,359
Don't smother it, please.
You know, Richard,

931
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,719
I understand your eagerness.

932
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,399
I really do.

933
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,199
You know I'm from Michigan,
right?

934
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,679
Let me tell you a story

935
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,839
about me and my dad and my brother.

936
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,039
We used to go ice
fishing every November.

937
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,239
Ice fishing, that's all anybody...

938
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,519
That's what we lived for.

939
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,079
Holy shit.
Just listen to me.

940
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,759
It's beautiful.
You have a little stove.

941
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,759
You huddle around,
you keep each other warm.

942
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,199
You drop a line and you just wait.

943
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,239
One year, my brother says,

944
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,599
"Let's go in October."

945
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,239
He wants to go
ice fishing in October.

946
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,159
My dad says,
"No, the ice is too thin."

947
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,079
My brother says,
I love my brother, he says...

948
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,519
I understand. Your brother
went out on the ice,

949
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,079
the ice was too thin,
he fell through the ice,

950
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,879
he went in the water
'cause he was too eager,

951
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,639
and you're saying I'm too eager.
That's what you're saying?

952
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,919
No, that's not what I'm saying.

953
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,359
What are you saying?

954
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,759
You know,
we'll finish the ice story

955
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,959
another time, young man.

956
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,119
For now, no Carmine Polito.

957
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,959
Go do your job.

958
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,399
<i>RICHIE: Stoddard shot the
whole thing down.</i>

959
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,011
Boring.

960
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,439
<i>But Edith was a genius.</i>

961
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,199
Yeah, you take me to Brenda.

962
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,919
<i>RICHIE: She somehow found this woman
who controlled the wire room.</i>

963
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,359
<i>A woman I'd never even heard of.</i>

964
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,959
She's amazing. She's in charge
of all the wire transfers.

965
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,079
<i>RICHIE: Way back in a warren
buried in the Bureau.</i>

966
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,559
She likes cats.

967
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,039
<i>This cat lady no one
ever even talked to.</i>

968
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,439
<i>And Edith met her in the ladies'
room and became friends with her.</i>

969
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,239
Brenda? Hi.

970
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,879
Hello.
How are you?

971
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,559
<i>RICHIE:
This lady handled all the wires,</i>

972
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,959
<i>and now she was
working with us.</i>

973
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,559
<i>She was excited to be
included in an operation</i>

974
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,079
<i>instead of just being
on the other end of a memo.</i>

975
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,559
You said you liked
exotic booze, so...

976
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,799
<i>It was beautiful.</i>
That's from England.

977
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,439
This is from England?
Yeah.

978
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,239
That's right. And I brought
you some tea as well.

979
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,599
Oh, thank you so much.
I mean, nobody

980
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,319
ever talks to me.
I know.

981
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,679
I mean, they just say, "Brenda,
do the clerical wiring stuff

982
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,279
"and don't ask questions."

983
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,799
You need to tell
Richie about your cats.

984
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,959
Oh, my cats?
He loves cats.

985
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,199
Oh, my cats?
Yeah.

986
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,359
Well, that's Harry.

987
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,599
Look at him standing up!
Isn't that sweet?

988
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,279
And that's Wendy.
She's a rascal.

989
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,359
But Barnaby, that's another story.

990
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,279
Barnaby plays the piano.

991
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,399
That's impressive.

992
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,039
<i>We got her to wire $2 million into
an FBI-controlled account at Chase.</i>

993
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,559
<i>It'd be there for five days,
and if Polito called,</i>

994
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,399
<i>he'd see that
the sheik was real.</i>

995
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,279
<i>And by the time
Stoddard caught up to us,</i>

996
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,999
<i>Edith made sure his boss
was impressed by my idea.</i>

997
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,719
<i>So, before he even
knew it was happening,</i>

998
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,559
<i>his boss was calling
to congratulate him.</i>

999
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,888
The sheik with the money
in the bank is a...

1000
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,799
<i>RICHIE: Anthony Amado. He had a major
hard-on to make a name for himself.</i>

1001
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,759
<i>I mean, this guy loved the
idea of being famous.</i>

1002
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,159
Don't be modest.

1003
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,999
<i>RICHIE: And Stoddard had to say</i>

1004
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,719
<i>it was his own idea or he'd look
stupid in front of his boss.</i>

1005
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,279
You made me accept praise
from my boss for thanking me

1006
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,879
for something that
never should have happened,

1007
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,479
something that I didn't approve.

1008
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,199
You should be happy.

1009
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,319
There's imaginative things
happening in this office.

1010
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,639
All right? We're not
just working in a box.

1011
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,999
<i>RICHIE: We got the $2 million to put
Carmine and the sheik together.</i>

<i>I liked being on
this side of the line.</i>

1014

He bought stolen art,
sold fake bank CD's.

1018
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,759
That's enough.
That's one.

1019
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,919
I get you three more, no politicians.

1020
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,399
You're going to do this

1021
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,759
because you got no choice,
you work for me.

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,479

a little power-drunk, Richard.

1024

You want to tell him, Edith?
You want to wake him up?

1025
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,599
Oh, no. I said we shouldn't
do any of it, Irving,

1026
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,919
you know I said that,
so now I support Richie.

I mean, he's the one
ruining America, not me.

How the fuck am I ruining America?

1031
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,319
Because people just got over
Watergate and Vietnam, all right,

1032
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,679
and you're going to shit all
over politicians again?

a big shot, get a promotion.

That's the fucking
art of becoming somebody

1046

who people can pin their
beliefs and their dreams on.

1047
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,289

1055

the speaker of the State Assembly,

1056
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,279
you got to knock him off of
his fucking feet, all right?

1057
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,879
He's got to feel like
he's out of his league.

What you're offering, this deal,

1059
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,319
I mean, this is unheard of
in the state of New Jersey,

1060
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,079
maybe even the whole
fucking country, all right?

1061
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,439
A sheik with hundreds
of millions of dollars

1062
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,319
to rebuild Atlantic City,
are you fucking kidding me?

1063
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,999
That's gigantic, all right?

1064
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,159
And the mayor, he's going
to want to see cash,

1065
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,239
he's going to want to
see it in an account,

1066
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,999
he's going to want to see it
right now, and he will check.

1067
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,759
And that's why this
meeting isn't happening.

1068

you need millions.

There's no fucking
reasoning with you.

1198
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,839
All right, Edith and I were
so successful for so long

1199
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,519

just small enough.

now, taking orders from me?

1204

Oh, my God, what did you do?

00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,519
Richard, the filter is
broken in the fish tank.

It's a problem.

1221
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,359
See, your job is to
do the filter, Mom.

Mine is to do the gravel.

1223
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,759
When you don't do the filter
right, all the fish die. See?

1224

I can't get that top on the
filter, that thing on there.

It means you got to be committed.

1520

committed to something

All right, thank you.

1530
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,399
All right, so tell me the rest
of the ice fishing story.

1531
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,439
Where was I?
Your father woke you up,

1532
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,199
it was a blizzard,
it was Lake Canoga.

1533
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,402
Come on, come on.

1534
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,239
Okay, well, my brother
and I were on the ice,

1535
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,199
and my father came out of the
house and I could see him coming.

1536
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,959
He was holding a lantern
and he was in the blizzard,

1537
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,839
and I knew he was gonna be angry.

1538
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,759
So I went to intercept my father,

1539
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,519
because I knew if he
saw what my brother

1540
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,039
was doing, he was gonna kill him.

1541
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,079
Oh, so you tried to
protect your brother,

1542
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,479
but you couldn't,
and that's why you feel bad,

1543
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,839
because you're trying to protect me

1544
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,319
and you're worried about me. Is
that what the story's about?

1545
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,399
It's about protection.
No, it's not about protection.

1546
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,679
It's not?
No.

Sheik Abdullah, gentlemen,

1848
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,399
from Abu Dhabi. Sheik,
these are professionals,

1849
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,439
and they run the best casinos
in the United States.

1850
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,839
Mr. Sheik, as a sign
of our seriousness,

1851
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,520
Mr. Tellegio came from
Miami to meet you tonight.

1852
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,919
Mr. Tellegio?

1853
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,799
Why didn't you tell me
Mr. Tellegio was...

1854
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,079
He's in the back room.

1855
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,599
It's a sign of disrespect

1856
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,519
to talk, uh, business
on the first meeting.

1857
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,119
That's not true.
It's disrespectful...

1858
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,959
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1859
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,959
He's got it all wrong.
You want to leave him back there in

1860
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,359
the back room waiting?
Come on, let's go, we got

1861
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,199
to go meet him.
My friend from New York

1862
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,799
doesn't know the customs...
Hey, no disrespect, pal.

1863
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,319
Hey, Irving,
I'm gonna be having fun.

1864
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,159
Maybe it'll be contagious, huh?

1865
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,879

1866

1873
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,759

it's beautiful in there.

1880
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,399
No, I don't have to go there. I like it here.
There's an exit.

1882

TELLEGIO: Nobody knows I'm here.

1883
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,239
Look, tell him I speak
for our friends in Florida.

1884
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,079
We're very excited.
It's been our lifelong dream

1885
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,399
to build casino resorts
on the East Coast.

You told him that?

1888
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,599
They didn't want
the Jews to make money.

1889
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,079
They didn't want the

They definitely don't want

I've been in the casino
business 40 years,

it's scrutinized more carefully
than any other business.

Carmine made this legal, but

1899
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,767
we must be careful,
or they'll take it away.

1900
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,639
So, Mr. Tellegio, how do you
think we should approach this?

What do you think?
What do you want to do?

1902
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,603
Well, if you want to get the
gaming license and keep it,

1903

we have to make our principal

01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,479
Well, to expedite citizenship,

1906
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,919
that requires very
special treatment.

1907
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,199

people to do that, Carmine.

Stoddard, please.

Oh, my God.

Good luck keeping
your job, by the way,

not being killed by the Mob,

you're doing a great job.

What's the end of
the ice fishing story?

2352
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,959
I'm not telling you the end
of the ice fishing story!

2353
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,159
I'm gonna call your fucking brother

2354

My brother's dead!

2355

That's how it ends!

2356
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,359
He fell through the fucking ice!

2357
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:17,087
Not, that's not... He died a
different way, many years later.

RICHIE: Listen, I know it's
awkward, and, uh,

2359
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,681
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, all right?

2360
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,599
But I think we can stick together
and, uh, still fulfill our goal.

2361
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,799
I mean, we got the Sherman Suite.

2362
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,959
Yeah, you got the whole floor?

Yeah. You?

Yeah, you know, it's all right.
Just got hit a little bit.

2368

You like it?
We do.

You know what,
give me those flowers.

2378
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,999
If we put the flower vase
here, put a camera in there,

2379
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,639
and then we can get
a clear shot of the couch

2380
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,879

2381

do all of this stuff.

now are at the Plaza Hotel,
