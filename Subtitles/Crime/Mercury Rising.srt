01:42:17,696 --> 01:42:20,893
Get up. Get up, get up.

1167
01:42:20,966 --> 01:42:23,127
That's right.

1168
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:53,393
- Tommy, no ! Hold 'em back !
- [ Jordan ] Hold your fire !

1169
01:42:53,465 --> 01:42:56,866
- Keep 'em back now !

1170
01:42:58,003 --> 01:43:01,234
[ Simon Screaming ]
No !

1171
01:43:33,605 --> 01:43:35,539
Where's the team leader ?

1172
01:43:35,607 --> 01:43:40,408
- Right here, Agent Jeffries.
- It's Kudrow's piece. I got a
nine-millimeter on the sidewalk.

1173
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:42,413
I'll take care of it.

1174
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:24,143
[ Teacher ]
Let's see what you got.

1175
01:44:24,212 --> 01:44:26,237
- I want you to say "bug."
- [ Girl ] Bug.

1176
01:44:26,314 --> 01:44:30,307
Can you look at me ?
Bug.

1177
01:44:30,385 --> 01:44:32,376
- Bug.
- That's very good.

1178
01:44:32,453 --> 01:44:34,648
[ Teacher ]
I like that very much.

1179
01:44:41,229 --> 01:44:43,220
Can I help you ?

1180
01:44:43,298 --> 01:44:46,563
I'm Art Jeffries,
a friend of Simon Lynch.

1181
01:44:46,634 --> 01:44:50,695
Yes, I know. His foster parents
told me all about you.

1182
01:44:50,772 --> 01:44:52,706
How's he doing ?

1183
01:44:52,774 --> 01:44:57,177
He's fine.
He's adjusted very well.

1184
01:44:58,246 --> 01:45:00,305
Do you want
to say hello ?

1185
01:45:00,381 --> 01:45:03,441
He probably wouldn't
remember me.

1186
01:45:03,518 --> 01:45:07,887
I was told...
not to expect too much.

1187
01:45:07,956 --> 01:45:12,188
I brought him some puzzles.
He likes puzzles.

1188
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:14,524
Do you think you could give
these to him, please ?

1189
01:45:14,596 --> 01:45:19,124
Sure, but I think it would
be better for Simon if you did.

1190
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,361
It's okay.
Come on.

1191
01:45:21,436 --> 01:45:23,370
Thank you.

1192
01:45:34,015 --> 01:45:35,949
Hey, Simon.

1193
01:45:36,017 --> 01:45:38,645
How you doin', partner ?

1194
01:45:41,956 --> 01:45:46,791
I brought you some new puzzles.
You might like those.

1195
01:45:50,865 --> 01:45:53,129
Hey, Simon, look at me.

1196
01:45:55,837 --> 01:45:59,102
Look at me, Simon.
Look in my eyes.

1197
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:02,733
Look in my eyes.

1198
01:46:06,447 --> 01:46:08,779
It's me, Art.
