Hold on, I'm just
doing the "Y" in daddy.

513
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,922

I really don't like that noise at all.

520
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,330
Ow...

521
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,162
- Rocking that gold tooth.
- I forget the rest.

522
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,045
[giggling]
Okay, okay. Ow!

523
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,723
Wu-Tang fan, huh?

524
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,536
My brother used to listen
to them all the time.

525
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,642
Oh, yeah, you have a brother?

526
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,245
I had a brother.

527
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,641
He died right before
starting college.

528
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,210
I'm sorry.

529
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,044
How long ago was that?

530
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,602
Two years ago, he was 18.

531
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,683
This July, I'll be older than him.

532

Older than my older brother.
Ow, ow, ow. ow...

Hey, hey, come on.
Stay with me, stay with me.

534
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,564
He was just one of those people
that wasn't afraid of anything.

535
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,881
He always said yes.

536
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,284
He would laugh so hard if he saw me
getting a tattoo right now.

537
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,169
Boom, I'm done! Go to that mirror
and you celebrate my work.

538
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,896

- You're watching Nerve, right?
- [girl] <i>Yeah, man, we all are.</i>

543
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,971
Alright, I'm trying to find
out more about this Ian guy.

544
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,283
Ian, my dude, he playing with your
little girlfriend, Vee, right?

545
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,656
Could be you but you ain't playing.

546
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,240
Alright, yes, that's the problem though

547
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,682
but I'm looking on his profile
and there's just nothing on the guy.

548
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,810
- Well, did you try Google?
- Yeah, I tried Google.

549
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,247
I guess he's a ghost then.

550
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,244
Look, I need to take it to Aruba.

551
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,491

not ready for that shit.</i>

553
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,616
- Yes, I know.
<i>- You're gonna mess up my rating.</i>

554
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,736
I'm not gonna mess up your rating.

555
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,489

- Come on.
- Alright, I'll send you a pass key.

559
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,567
Alright, thank you.

560
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,522
A lighthouse?
I love it, thank you.

561
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,491
Well, a very wise person once said,
and this was earlier today,

562
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,490
they said that the lighthouse represents
the thing that you want the most.

563
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,167
So, whatever that is,
I hope you get it.

564
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,567
<i>How many followers
does she have now?</i>

565
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,883
I mean, to be fair,
you did tell her to take a risk.

566
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,281
This isn't what I meant, Liv.

567
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,290
This is ridiculous.

568
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,089

569
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,001

asking if I can trust you. Can I?</i>

570
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,401
<i>I have the perfect
tattoo picked out for you.</i>

<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

572
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,563
<i>- No, okay, it's not a tattoo dare.

576
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,446

Alright?

586
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,285
Easy one, alright, let's do this.

587
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,042
What did that just say?

588
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,280
Blindfolded?
On the motorcycle.

Yeah?

590
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,486
- You're on your own with that one.
- Wait, I can't do this alone.

591
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,369
Come on, I need you
to help me navigate.

592
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,171
There's no way in hell I'm doing that.

I'm sorry, I'm out.

That doesn't sound like a hack.

846
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,242
Don't walk away from me, Vee.

847
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,448
Wake up, this is a game.

848
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,896
<i>Do you really think
that someone like him</i>

849
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,616
<i>is actually gonna be with you
when this is all done?</i>

850
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,641
Wait, you don't know me.

851
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,569
Oh, I'm sorry,
you really like her now?

852
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,880
Yeah, I do.

853
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,096
<i>Alright, come on Syd,
you're just drunk.</i>

854
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,202
<i>Tommy, it is time to get over her.</i>

855
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,408
Clearly she has traded up.

856
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,006
Why do you have to be such a bitch?

857
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:16,642
Look at that, little Vee
finally speaking her mind.

858
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,961
<i>Come on, unburden yourself.</i>

859
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:24,444
You know why we're best friends?
I do whatever you want all the time.

860
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,931
<i>No, Vee.</i>

861
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,450
<i>We're friends because
I'm fun and you're boring.</i>

862
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,646
The only fun thing about
you was your brother.

863
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,086
What is it you think?

864
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,004
That playing Nerve is just gonna
magically make you a different person?

865
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,641
That's not how life works,
you'll never be a player.

866
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,728
Right, right.

867
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,451
I know how much you love
living in the moment, Syd.

868
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,888
Well remember this
moment because you're one of those girls

869
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,564
who peaks in high school.

870
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,450
And you wake up one day still
living in Staten Island,

871
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,965
still screwing the same guys,

872
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,168
wondering what the hell
happened to your life.

873
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,720
If you want to know
where I am from now on,

874
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,564
sign up and watch me.

875
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,803
[crowd chattering]

876
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,008
[Ian]
Wait, Vee, what are you doing?

877
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,210
Hey, hey, Vee,
you don't need to do this.

878
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,296
Look at me, come on, let's just go.
Let's bail, alright?

879
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,560
What do you have to prove?

880
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,405
Come on, please, let's go.

881
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,167
[boy] You got it, Vee, please.

882
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,083
[gm 1] Go, girl!

883
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,570
[girl 2] Oh, my God, Vee.

884
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,529
Whoa!

885
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,648
[indistinct chatter]

886
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,527
[all cheering]

887
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,884
[phone beeps]

888
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,086
That'll take you into first, Vee!

889
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,481
That was messed up.

890
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,016
I can't deal with this
right now, I'm gonna go.

891
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,486
Vee, do you know that
he's played Nerve before?

892
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,686
What?

893
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,816
Yeah, it was his dare to get
you here and fight with Syd.

894
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,569
That's why he brought you here.

895
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,971
Look.

896
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,969
Do you still trust him?

897
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,565
Vee, wait, wait.

898
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,086
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

899
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,004
Did you take me here
as part of the game?

900
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,363
Answer me, is it true?

901
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,608
- What are you doing?
- It's more complicated than that.

902
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,603
I just lost my
two best friends tonight.

903
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,320
- I know.
- How much did you get for that?

904
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,496
No, no, it's not about
the money, alright?

905
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,488
But I promise,
I'll explain to you later.

906
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,976
Just don't even bother, okay?
I mean, Sydney almost died tonight.

907
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,526
- I almost died tonight.
- Vee, I know, I know.

908
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,921
This game is sick,
I'm going to the police.

909
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,604
Wait, no, no, no.

910
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,444
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

911
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,576
I'm sorry, you can't do that, alright?
You can't go to the police.

912
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,921
Why not?
Because I'll lose the game?

913
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,209
No, it's not about that.
Vee, Vee.

914
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,210
You can't go to the police.
It's the last thing you wanna do.

915
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,682
Vee, wait, I was trying to hurt you.
It just got out of control.

916
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,206
- [crowd chattering]
- Move, just get out of my way.

917
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,767
Officer!

918
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:48,683
Officer, officer, I need help. I'm
playing this game, it's called Nerve.

919
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,650
And I'm worried that someone's
gonna get really hurt.

920
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,087
Snitch.

921
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,568
- That game, are they playing too?
- Yeah.

922
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,324
Dude, get out of this.

923
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,363
Is there a crime being committed?

924
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,809
No, but a kid could die tonight.

925
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,696
Look, here, it's all on
my phone, you can see.

926
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,881
[phone buzzing]

927
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,209
What? What?

928
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,331
[all] Snitch! Snitch!

929
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,767
[indistinct yelling]

930
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,403
- Mom?
<i>- Honey, what's going on?</i>

931
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,405
- Mom!
<i>- Vee, where are you?</i>

932
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,484
All the money is missing
from our account!

933
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,291
- Wait, what?
- Vee, honey, are you in trouble?

934
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,966
<i>Can you just please
tell me what's going on?</i>

935
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,646
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna
fix this I promise.

936
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,361
<i>Fix what?</i>

937
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,887
Hello?
Vee, hello, Vee?

938
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,851
I'm sorry but I
got to win this game.

939
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,244
[beeping]

940
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,883
[groans]

941
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,167
[electricity buzzes]

942
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,482
[sobbing]

943
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,889
[computer powers up]

944
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,649
[computer voice] <i>Hello, Vee.</i>

945
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,441
<i>You broke the rules,
you are our prisoner.</i>

946
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,682
<i>We told you not to snitch.</i>

947
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,406
<i>Now we control your life.</i>

948
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,131
<i>We control your family.</i>

949
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,089
<i>We control your future.</i>

950
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,160
<i>The only way out is to
win the final round.</i>

951
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,801
<i>Go to the Staten Island ferry
and the Watchers will find you.</i>

952
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,646
<i>See you in the finals,
see you in the finals...</i>

953
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,569
[man yelling indistinct]

954
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,441
I'm coming for you, Vee!

955
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,045
- Vee, thank God, are you okay?
- Am I okay? No, I'm not okay.

956
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,645
You need to tell me everything.

957
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,616
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
- Come here, come here.

958
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,404
Why is this happening to me?

959
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,770
That guy, Ty, we both played
Nerve last year in Seattle.

960
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,367
We got a dare to hang from a
construction crane, 200 feet in the air.

961
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,205
The two of us
and this kid named Robby.

962
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,725
[Ty] Five, four, three

963
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,096
[Ian]
Come on, Robby, that's enough.

964
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,176
- [Ty] Got it?
- [Ian] Shit, he's slipping.

965
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,406
[Ty] Two, one.

966
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,569
Come on, grab my
hand, man, grab my hand.

967
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,962
Ty and I, we bailed
and we went to the cops.

968
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,850
We tried to get the game shut down
but they didn't do anything.

969
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,082
No, they just called it an accident.

970
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,645
[yelling in background]

971
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,486
Then, the Watchers
came after us for snitching.

972
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,121
But they messed with my dad's job,
they leaked photos of my sister online,

973
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,568
they stole our identities, Vee.

974
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,450
Me and Ty, we became
prisoners of the game.

975
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,010
Oh, come on, what
does that even mean?

976
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,765
It's the third category.

977
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,002
Watcher, Player, Prisoner.

978
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,611
I'm trapped.
The only way out is to win.

979
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,765
- So, you have to win.
- No... No, you do.

980
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,721
- What?
- Vee, you're a Prisoner now.

981
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,088
Okay, you and I, we're going to the
final round together and I'm gonna lose.

982
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,010
- What, no, you can't do that.
- It's already done, it's already done.

983
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,216
I told the Watchers to give me a dare

984
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,527
that's gonna knock Ty
out of second place.

985
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,284
It's gonna be me and you.

986
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,850
[phone beeping]

987
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,530
- I have to go.
- No, no, no.

988
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,056
Okay, I wanna take you
somewhere safe, let's go.

989
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,605
There has to be another way.

990
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,881
There isn't.

991
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:11,082
If it's not me in the finals, then
it's Ty and he'll do anything to win.

992
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,565
Just tell me we're gonna do this.

993
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,249
[motorcycle revs]

994
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,284
Hey, it's not your fault.

995
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,448
I just hope she's okay.

996
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,284
[phone ringing]

997
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,170
- Hello?
- [Vee] <i>Guys, it's me.</i>

998
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,925
Oh, my God, Vee, where are you?

999
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,486
I'm so sorry.

1000
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:25,936
It doesn't matter,
I'm just glad you're okay.

1001
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,201
- Alright, guys, come on, let's go.
- [Vee] I can't.

1002
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,770
[Sydney] What?

1003
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,251
I have to finish this.

1004
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,446
Are you insane?

1005
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,249
Vee, what are you talking about?

1006
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,164
It's never gonna end, I mean,
even if they live me alone,

1007
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,616
they're just gonna do
it to somebody else.

1008
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,325
We can't stop the game if we wanted to.
There's no one to stop.

1009
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,886
It's just a bunch of anonymous people.

1010
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,165
What if they weren't anonymous?

1011
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,616
<i>Ian's doing a dare that
will put him to the final,</i>

1012
