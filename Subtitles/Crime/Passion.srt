So do I.
194 of

You can not say it.
195 of
00:22:37,365 -> 00:22:40,835
Why can not you just say it?

188
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,994
You can not say it.
195 of
00:22:37,365 -> 00:22:40,835
Why can not you just say it?

189

Why can not you just say it?

190
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:52,515
When I was six years old,
my parents bought -

191
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:56,314
me and my twin
the common bicycle.
198 of the
00:22:56,485 -> 00:22:59,045
Do you have a twin sister?

192
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:59,045
Do you have a twin sister?

193
00:23:00,605 --> 00:23:03,802
Alternately cycled to school.

194
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:09,635
Clarissa was a better bike ride.
He knew how to ride a bicycle standing up.

195
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,035
And to drive with no hands.
202 of
00:23:13,085 -> 00:23:15,645
One day, the
when it was my turn, -
203 of
00:23:15,805 -> 00:23:20,435
I wanted to show,
that cycled as well.

196
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,645
One day, the
when it was my turn, -
203 of
00:23:15,805 -> 00:23:20,435
I wanted to show,
that cycled as well.

197
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:20,435
I wanted to show,
that cycled as well.

198
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:27,801
Pedal faster and faster.
Clarissa had to run hard.

199
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:34,840
I let go of the handlebars.
I felt like to fly to.

200
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:40,960
It felt wonderful.
I wanted to see myself, -

201
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:48,236
so I looked at the window,
and thus the shadows.

202
00:23:51,205 --> 00:23:56,563
I do not know what happened.
Bike slid into the middle of the street.

203
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:02,237
Truck ran towards me.

204
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:09,202

That I killed him.

212
00:24:56,965 --> 00:25:01,197

Shit!

342
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:58,076

343
00:43:00,485 --> 00:43:04,364
Isabelle! Is everything all right?

344
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:12,597
What happened? I need to talk.
I noticed one strange thing.

345
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:20,797
I am looking for one contract,
which was carried out earlier this year.

346
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:24,958
I noticed a huge difference
Dirk Harriman on the figures provided -

347
00:43:25,685 --> 00:43:29,234
and the Middle East markets
the actual budget range.

348
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:35,162
Christine added a folder in the Annex,
which is like a criminal prosecution.

349
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:52,519
I knew that the man?
there was something strange. - What?

350
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:57,440
Dirk betrayed the money, and Christine
stopped protecting him.

351
00:44:03,165 --> 00:44:07,477
Can I help you with something?
- Bring me some coffee.

352
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:11,836
Did you hear already?

353
00:44:12,005 --> 00:44:16,521
Our managers to keep cocktail party
all department managers.

00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:20,443
Tomorrow night here.

00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:24,678
If not turn up,
get a toaster for Christmas.

356
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:37,116
We have a little surprise for you.
I hope it amuses you.

357
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:41,844
What are these walls
is actually happening?

358
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:46,602
I've put together for us
a small document.

359
00:44:46,765 --> 00:44:51,441
"Very stressed-out leader
not very secret life. "

360
00:44:51,925 --> 00:44:57,477
Also included is the ecstasy and suffering
and little instruction.

361
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:24,395
One manager will be pissed.
Familiar to us all.

362
00:45:25,885 --> 00:45:29,958
Should not be given the frustration
to domination.

363
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:34,164
Take a deep breath,
relax and keep going.

364
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:37,474
Is not that right?

365
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:40,159
This will be the next piece.

366
00:45:48,405 --> 00:45:50,965
Caught red-handed.

367
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,674
We all have a need for
extract a bit of pressure at work.

368
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:59,396
You know the ones, who you are.
Go still next time the hotel.

369
00:45:59,565 --> 00:46:03,717
Outside working hours, thank you.

370
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:05,921
What about then?

371
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:13,997
The impact directly on the concrete column.

372
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:24,880
Someone is not happy
parking place.

373
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:41,115
Come on, Isabelle.
It was just a joke.

374
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:46,714
Where's your sense of humor is?

375
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:53,885
I think you really get hurt.

376
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:59,042
I'm really sorry.

377
00:46:59,205 --> 00:47:02,481
I thought that we could
laugh at this one.

378
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:19,518
It was funny.

379
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:56,563
Hey. I would like to talk about
Katzman with your doctor.

380
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:03,882

Close the door.

00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:54,762
Isabelle, I said I was sorry.

384
00:48:54,925 --> 00:48:58,395
And yet, I got this.
- What is it?

385
00:48:59,925 --> 00:49:04,316
"I'll never forget that humiliated
to me. You'll pay for it. "

386
00:49:04,485 --> 00:49:07,318
"Revenge is sweet."

387
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,920
I have not written that.
- It was sent to you from your computer.

388
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:18,078
Not very clever.

After all, he already eats pills.

How about a little kiss

What are you doing?

Why kissed the bitch?
After all he is doing.

Do not talk to me like that tone.
Keep your mouth shut and go back to work.

Do you think nobody would notice?

You forced me to do
a very bad thing.

You owe me.
Do not leave me in the lurch.

01:03:06,205 --> 01:03:09,038
Can we come in?

449
01:03:11,685 --> 01:03:13,994
Are you all right?

450
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:18,843
Are you all right?
- I do not. I have not.

451
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:23,203
I took sleeping pills.
I can not sleep.

452
01:03:25,165 --> 01:03:30,478
Do you know that Christine Stanford
throat was slit on Saturday?

453
01:03:35,885 --> 01:03:38,160
Do you recognize this?

454
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:49,117
Do you recognize this?
It has been sent from your computer.

455
01:03:56,245 --> 01:04:00,716
Is not the victim of some
humility now on you at work?

456
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:04,399
Miss James?

457
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:11,996
We found ... Miss James!

458
01:04:12,165 --> 01:04:14,281
I am here.

459
01:04:15,245 --> 01:04:19,841
We found the victim's hand, fibers,
derived from scarf.

460
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:23,680
Such,
that you have in this picture.

461
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:33,078
Can you explain it? Where were you
Saturday night at 23.30 - 01.00?

462
01:04:38,765 --> 01:04:42,041
I was at the ballet.
- Where?

463
01:04:43,285 --> 01:04:45,924
Ballet.

464
01:04:46,685 --> 01:04:49,643
Were you alone?
- I was.

465
01:04:49,805 --> 01:04:54,754
To identify any of you?
- Why would it have been?

466
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:59,282
Sometimes you can meet people,
who may remember.

467
01:05:00,645 --> 01:05:03,398
Remember what?
- You to attend.

468
01:05:03,565 --> 01:05:08,559
You would have an alibi, and you should
could not kill Christine Stanford.

469
01:05:09,645 --> 01:05:12,842
I could not ...
I will never ...

470
01:05:14,405 --> 01:05:18,557
If you have a lawyer,
you should call him.

471
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,804
Open your mouth.

472
01:05:30,325 --> 01:05:34,716
Laboratory confirmed,
the fibers are scarf.

473
01:05:36,085 --> 01:05:39,600
You will be charged with murder.

474
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:50,274
Isabelle, are you okay?

475
01:05:51,925 --> 01:05:55,998
Can we get him in the water?
- Miss James.

476
01:05:57,765 --> 01:06:01,804
Is a break?
Do you need a doctor?

477
01:06:01,965 --> 01:06:05,241
I do not.
- Let's get this soon.

Lavastitte burglary,
aggravating the offense.

479
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:17,557
It is, therefore, of a deliberate murder.

480
01:06:19,325 --> 01:06:24,240
Why do not you just recognize?
It would save everyone time and money.

481
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:29,081
You have a few fiber, which is suitable for
my client scarf image.

482
01:06:29,245 --> 01:06:34,444
How many other scarf they fit?
Did you find the sacrifice of my client's DNA?

Yes, yes, I suppose so.
- Think about what you say, Isabelle.

485
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:58,234
What do you mean "probably"?

Away from the door!

492
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:30,238
<i> Are you all right, Isabelle </ i></i>

493
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:33,795
<i> Surmasitteko Christine Stanford? </ i>
- Do not respond to . </ I></i>

494
01:08:33,965 --> 01:08:37,037
<i> Surmasitteko </ i>
-  He did not do it. </ I></i>

495
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:41,244
<i> Did you kill her? </ i>
-  My client's mental state ... </ i></i>

496
01:08:41,405 --> 01:08:45,444
<i>Heads of  confessed to the murder. </ i>
-  I confess. </ I></i>

497
01:09:04,485 --> 01:09:07,602
What?
- I want to see my lawyer.

498
01:09:07,765 --> 01:09:12,316
I did not kill Christine.
- You want a confession back?

499
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:16,160
I'm innocent.
- Then why are you confessed?

500
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:21,274
I do not know. I was so tired.
I was a pill drunk.

501
01:09:21,445 --> 01:09:24,994
I would have recognized anything.

502
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:29,116
I need to talk
with the prosecutor immediately.

503
01:09:31,045 --> 01:09:35,835
This looks the same material,
but my scarf is not broken.

504
01:09:37,485 --> 01:09:41,603
Where is it?
- Somewhere in my apartment.

505
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:45,280
We studied the apartment thoroughly
and did not find anything.

506
01:09:45,445 --> 01:09:52,317
Seek out yet. The scarf is there.
- He has no reason to lie.

507
01:09:52,485 --> 01:09:58,321
You've wasted enough of my time.
- Why would I be murdered Christine?

508
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:03,320
You had a strong motive. Revenge.
- I have not written that.

509
01:10:03,485 --> 01:10:08,036
And if I were, then it would have been
foolish to kill him.

510
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:12,118
Christine probably sent it to the
my computer.

511
01:10:15,445 --> 01:10:19,358
Creator. Look at the date.

512
01:10:19,525 --> 01:10:23,120
This is referred to
days before the lumps.

513
01:10:25,285 --> 01:10:29,517
Do you see? The day before
he humbled me.

514
01:10:32,045 --> 01:10:34,957
This does not make sense.
I did not write this.

515
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:39,482
I was about to get a promotion,
Christine and bear it.

516
01:10:39,645 --> 01:10:45,242
He tried to suppress Isabelle.
Many department confirms -

517
01:10:45,405 --> 01:10:49,080
that my client became depressed
Christine's bullying of.

518
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,964
Are you crazy?
That's defenses?

519
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:55,481
Spare
mitigating circumstances for the judge!

520
01:10:55,645 --> 01:10:59,524
I'm only interested in evidence.
- It is what we are trying to give.

521
01:10:59,685 --> 01:11:03,564
I was not Christine's house.
I was at the ballet.

522
01:11:03,725 --> 01:11:06,193
You claim it.

523
01:11:09,485 --> 01:11:12,204
I talked to
Ballet with an usher.

524
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:16,517
He had a gray, curly hair,
and he spoke bad English.

525
01:11:16,685 --> 01:11:19,153
He remembers me.

526
01:11:21,685 --> 01:11:25,917
Have you seen this woman?
- I do not.

527
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:28,315
Do not you surely?
- I do not.

528
01:11:36,085 --> 01:11:41,079
Days. Katsoisitteko this?
Have you seen this woman?

529
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:47,280
I am.
- Do you?

530
01:11:47,445 --> 01:11:51,961
He sat there. He wanted to
may sit in the middle of the line.

531
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,003
I had to guide him in there.

532
01:11:55,165 --> 01:11:59,317
Whether or not this will certainly
this woman? - There was.

533
01:12:00,085 --> 01:12:04,601
I booked a ticket
Saturday night's myöhäisnäytökseen.

534
01:12:04,765 --> 01:12:07,882
He could not be
Christine's home.

535
01:12:08,045 --> 01:12:13,278
Maybe he left the States. Christine
the house was ten minutes away.

536
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:22,119
Why do not you ask Dirk harrimanella?
He was reportedly there.

537
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:26,039
He was furious,
Christine rejected because of him.

538
01:12:26,205 --> 01:12:28,241
And he was drunk.

539
01:12:29,205 --> 01:12:35,155
He knew everything from ballet.
- It is a well-known classic.

540
01:12:35,325 --> 01:12:39,716
Usher guarantee him an alibi.
What else do we have?

541
01:12:39,885 --> 01:12:43,878
His DNA was not
the murder weapon and the crime scene.

542
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:47,560
No DNA but e-mail,
which is the only who could not write.

543
01:12:47,725 --> 01:12:52,082
As if we were forced
labile to recognize the woman.

544
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:54,884
Just check
Christine male friend.

545
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:58,196
Witnesses saw them
fighting over the crime scene outside.

546
01:12:58,365 --> 01:13:02,244
Or even miesystäväkin.
Either the house is checking out?

547
01:13:02,405 --> 01:13:05,556
Together, this evidence
nolaan myself in court.

548
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:11,395
My client was accused of
wrong reasons. He has an alibi.

549
01:13:11,565 --> 01:13:15,274
Against him is not
no evidence. No DNA.

550
01:13:15,445 --> 01:13:19,120
What about the scarf fibers?
- They are not my huivistani.

551
01:13:19,285 --> 01:13:24,882
You say, then, that you have for one.
- It must be found. It is not broken.

552
01:13:25,045 --> 01:13:29,277
May I make a suggestion?
- Of course.

553
01:13:29,445 --> 01:13:34,041
Do you offer to help my client
scarf for search?

554
01:14:21,885 --> 01:14:23,762
What's this?

555
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:30,080
Christine found out that Dirk
tried to cheat a large sum of money.

556
01:14:30,245 --> 01:14:33,794
How much?
- I do not know the exact figure.

557
01:14:33,965 --> 01:14:36,399
More than five million.

558
01:14:36,565 --> 01:14:40,399
The sum of one million of Class,
and Christine was going to expose him?

559
01:14:40,565 --> 01:14:43,477
Why piilottelitte proof?

560
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:48,275
We are friends. Dirk needed
just the time to restore the money.

561
01:14:48,445 --> 01:14:52,563
So hid the information. Do not you
understand that it is a motive for murder?

562
01:14:52,725 --> 01:14:56,195
No! Dirk could never do that.

563
01:14:57,885 --> 01:15:01,639
We have to leave.
- Wait a minute. Can I look for?

564
01:15:01,805 --> 01:15:06,879
My scarf is in that box.
Sometimes they slip out of the back of the box.

565
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:11,118
Alright. Let her look.
- Thank you.

566
01:15:21,205 --> 01:15:25,244
It's got to be here.
- That's enough, Isabelle.

567
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:28,841
It's got to be here! No!

568
01:15:29,005 --> 01:15:33,556
Even a minute!
Just one minute! Do not be!

569
01:15:37,045 --> 01:15:39,081
I did not do it.

570
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:43,397
Of course not.
I know that.

571
01:15:49,485 --> 01:15:53,842
Headscarf is
in one of the apartment.

572
01:15:54,885 --> 01:15:57,274
You have to look for it.

573
01:16:20,165 --> 01:16:23,919
What a mess.
Should I clean up?

574
01:16:25,325 --> 01:16:29,398
Where did you get this?
- It was dirty, the back of the box.

575
01:16:29,565 --> 01:16:32,443
I took it to the cleaners.

576
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:37,121
Ms. Wirth, this is outrageous.
You will get another cleaner.

577
01:16:40,885 --> 01:16:42,637
Detective Chief Inspector Bach.

578
01:16:45,405 --> 01:16:48,715
Mr. Harriman.
- What do you want?

579
01:16:48,885 --> 01:16:53,561
I am a detective sergeant Bach.
You are accused of embezzlement.

580
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:59,721
We studied the place.
First the car, then your apartment.

581
01:16:59,885 --> 01:17:04,083
You have to get the wire.
- The prosecutor will explain to you everything.

582
01:17:05,525 --> 01:17:08,915
Christine broke into Stanford
apartment night of the murder?

583
01:17:09,085 --> 01:17:12,634
I will not.
- Do you deny olleenne there?

584
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:14,875
I do not.

585
01:17:15,045 --> 01:17:20,915
Were you his guest?
- I was. I arrived late.

586
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:24,521
When?
- I do not remember.

587
01:17:24,685 --> 01:17:28,678
You do not remember?
- I do not remember.

588
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:38,554
Is this you?

589
01:17:40,165 --> 01:17:43,282
It was scarf.

590
01:17:44,965 --> 01:17:47,081
Was that?
- Yes.

591
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:51,955
If that's Christine Stanford
blood ... Put the recovery.

592
01:17:54,525 --> 01:17:58,757
This is ridiculous.
- Kavalsitte company money.

593
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:03,919
Christine was going to report you.
You're a villain but also a murderer.

594
01:18:04,085 --> 01:18:09,079
I do not speak any
without a lawyer present.

595
01:18:15,245 --> 01:18:20,194
Is not it incredible?
He bought me a bouquet of roses.

596
01:18:20,365 --> 01:18:24,324
Then he showed up at my door
apologize.

597
01:18:24,485 --> 01:18:28,603
He was quite red
naamaltaan and bathed in sweat.

598
01:18:28,765 --> 01:18:31,723
He was so sorry,
I was arrested a while.

599
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:35,321
The time sweet.
Did you invite him in?

600
01:18:35,485 --> 01:18:40,161
No, you crazy?
I smiled sweetly, -

601
01:18:40,325 --> 01:18:44,637
I took the cheap roses fool
with explanatory notes and threw them in the garbage.

602
01:18:44,805 --> 01:18:47,444
Bach poor. What a cliché.

603
01:18:47,605 --> 01:18:50,995
The hard-boiled cop
fall in love with the beautiful killer.

604
01:18:52,765 --> 01:18:55,484
I'm not a murderer.

605
01:18:57,005 --> 01:18:58,643
Oh, yeah.

606
01:18:59,725 --> 01:19:04,276
Dani ...
I know what you did for me.

607
01:19:05,765 --> 01:19:10,281
You would have done the same for me.
- Of course.

608
01:19:17,885 --> 01:19:23,562
Shall again
number 26? - Okay.

609
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:47,643
They are okay, but do not
good enough. What do you think?

610
01:19:52,605 --> 01:19:54,436
Dani!

611
01:19:56,285 --> 01:19:59,322
That kiss did not happen.

612
01:19:59,485 --> 01:20:04,036
I love you.
I want you, Isabelle.

613
01:20:07,405 --> 01:20:09,680
That's the problem.

614
01:20:11,485 --> 01:20:15,478
Why?
- Jesus Christ! Are you kidding me?

615
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:25,277
After all, you love me.
- I do not. What's wrong with you?

616
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:28,198
I do not love you.
- You love.

617
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:31,641
You may not want to admit it,
but you love me.

618
01:20:31,805 --> 01:20:36,083
We have drunk too much.
I make espressos, and I'll call a taxi.

619
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:39,635
Go home and sleep.
Talk to you tomorrow.

620
01:20:39,805 --> 01:20:45,004
No, not tomorrow.
It's not true, Isabelle?

621
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:49,795
You love me.
- Stop it. You are pathetic.

622
01:20:49,965 --> 01:20:53,560
Am I pathetic?
All my support after that?

623
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:59,755
I am grateful. Thank you.
- That you gave already.

624
01:21:01,885 --> 01:21:07,278
This is the espresso. Sit down
and then find out. I'll call you a cab.

625
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:19,597
Hello. The most space taxi.

626
01:22:09,005 --> 01:22:11,519
Ytyjä pills.

627
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:20,994
You know, I'm not at risk.
I was wondering pills popsimistasi.

628
01:22:21,165 --> 01:22:25,761
<i> Until a couple of them fell to </ i>
 teeheni and I tasted them. </ i></i>

629
01:22:25,925 --> 01:22:29,884
They were
Sweetening harmless.

630
01:22:31,845 --> 01:22:35,838
I followed you to see
what are you gonna.

631
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:43,794
<i> first stop </ i>
 was a scarf store. </ i></i>

632
01:22:43,965 --> 01:22:48,720
<i> You bought the same scarf as </ i>
 got Christine and hide it. </ i></i>

633
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:50,762
<i> interesting. </ i></i>

634
01:22:53,005 --> 01:22:56,714
What about then?
Oh, and ballet.

635
01:22:58,485 --> 01:23:04,117
<i> followed you and saw how </ i>
 cause a conflict and you got an alibi. </ i></i>

636
01:23:36,525 --> 01:23:39,915
<i> last stop </ i>
 was Christine's house. </ i></i>

637
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:18,081
<i> All the pieces fell into place </ i>
 place. </ i></i>

638
01:24:20,725 --> 01:24:22,920
The perfect moment.

639
01:24:37,525 --> 01:24:40,085
Let me in, Christine.

640
01:24:45,245 --> 01:24:49,477
<i>Confession was the bait.
-  I confess. </ I></i>

641
01:24:49,645 --> 01:24:54,355
It's a fool lieutenant swallowed up the false
hook, line and sinker clues.

642
01:25:05,525 --> 01:25:08,961
The perfect murder.
- Except for ...

643
01:25:09,805 --> 01:25:11,477
Videos.

644
01:25:11,645 --> 01:25:16,400
I gathered them aggravating
folder Lieutenant Bach.

645
01:25:16,565 --> 01:25:18,874
And I downloaded this folder.

646
01:25:19,045 --> 01:25:22,799
And can not be traced?
- I bought this for that purpose.

647
01:25:22,965 --> 01:25:28,756
Is not it cute?
You just have to press the send button.

648
01:25:38,165 --> 01:25:42,238
What do you want?
- Do not talk like that tone.

649
01:25:45,565 --> 01:25:47,840
What do you want?

650
01:25:49,605 --> 01:25:51,402
Come here.

651
01:26:04,445 --> 01:26:06,356
Sit down.

652
01:26:10,445 --> 01:26:12,754
Come closer.

653
01:26:19,725 --> 01:26:21,522
Kiss me.

654
01:26:31,485 --> 01:26:35,922
Do not like it?
You love me.

655
01:26:48,685 --> 01:26:50,880
Turn around.

656
01:27:01,005 --> 01:27:03,155
I love you.

657
01:27:59,125 --> 01:28:02,800
I thought,
the twin sister of a fairy tale.

658
01:28:03,765 --> 01:28:07,280
I did not get the opportunity to
ask for forgiveness.

659
01:28:34,325 --> 01:28:36,043
So?

660
01:31:14,485 --> 01:31:15,600
SEND ?
