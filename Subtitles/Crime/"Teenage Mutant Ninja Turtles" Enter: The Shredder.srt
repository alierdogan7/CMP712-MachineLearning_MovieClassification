I just hope I haven't
missed out on the action!

Rest here a moment,

You know, that was
almost too easy.

00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,199
I really wish you'd stop
saying things like that.

aw, this is ridiculous.

374

We're never gonna
stop those guys.

375
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:10,406
Yeah, those jerks
belong in a zoo,

376
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:12,009
not the streets.

Sorry. We'll have to take
a rain check on that.
