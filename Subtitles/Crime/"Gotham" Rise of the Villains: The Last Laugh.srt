1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,550
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,720
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,920
Six criminally insane inmates were busted out of Arkham Asylum.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,000
They want mass panic.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,190
Hello, Jim.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,320
How do I look?

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,070
Barbara!

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,050
Yo, Commish.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,820
Yeah?

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,840
Don't move!

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,520
You should probably get back to work.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,500
Who knows what went wrong while you were gone?

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,010
It's a new day Jim.

14
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,330
Jerome Valeska.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,340
The attack on the GCPD.

16
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,070
Someone on the streets is talking.

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,210
Somebody knows something.

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,790
Valeska has red hair, crazy laugh.

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,730
Might be rolling with a blonde number.

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,220
I-I don't know anything.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,200
- Honest! - You believe him?

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,840
Nope.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,690
Me neither.

24
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,660
It's the truth! But, hey,

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,420
I-I can help you guys, you know, spread the word and stuff.

26
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,260
Valeska killed a friend of ours.

27
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,090
Anybody hides him,

28
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,440
anybody protects him,

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,740
they go down, too, you got it?

30
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,490
Now spread the word.

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,780
No! No!

32
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,890
Sneaking out?

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,480
Just like a guy.

34
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,050
There are loose ends that need tying.

35
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,310
Need this?

36
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,650
Bring back bagels.

37
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,120
No need for that.

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,850
I thought Ms. Kean and I could have a little chat.

39
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,770
Good morning.

40
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,410
Jerome is waiting outside.

41
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,950
Try and keep him focused.

42
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,330
You be nice.

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,350
You two seem to be getting along.

44
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,570
I'm so glad.

45
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,380
She needs a friend.

46
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,280
My sister is a very special person.

47
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,710
She seems so strong, but yet she's quite fragile.

48
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,550
Sugar?

49
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,990
Sure.

50
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,260
You acquitted yourself very well

51
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,890
at the adventure at the GCPD.

52
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,220
Jim Gordon escaped the carnage unscathed.

53
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,000
Top marks.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,970
Thank you.

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,720
Did you know my family built this city?

56
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,100
We carved the bedrock upon which it stands,

57
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,790
yet there is not a bridge, an alley,

58
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,920
a ditch that carries our name.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,970
My forefathers were betrayed, their legacy erased,

60
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,720
and I am here to punish those who wronged us

61
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,910
and reclaim what is ours.

62
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,470
Strawberry?

63
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,820
I didn't ask.

64
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,360
So you're gonna take over Gotham

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,180
by unleashing a bunch of loonies.

66
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,680
Awesome plan.

67
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,920
That's only part one.

68
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,130
So what's the second part?

69
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,410
You're gonna love it.

70
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,330
There's a starring role for you.

71
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,040
You'll be famous and powerful,

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,330
and your fondest dream will come true.

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,620
You know my dreams, do you?

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,090
When Jim Gordon has outlived his usefulness,

75
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,930
I'm gonna help you destroy him.

76
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,330
Not kill him.

77
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,030
Destroy him.

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,030
Body and soul.

79
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,980
Shocking images. Gotham is on high alert today after...

80
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,870
Look, I'm just saying, I'll chuck mopes out of windows

81
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,820
until the cows come home, but at some point,

82
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,200
we got to go see Penguin.

83
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,930
Why would he break Jerome out of Arkham

84
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,370
or attack the GCPD?

85
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,240
He wouldn't, but that weasel's running things now.

86
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,340
- If there's chatter, he'd know it. - I'll think about it.

87
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,030
- Jim... - I'll think about it!

88
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,390
Alvarez, where are you with Jerome's circus contacts?

89
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,910
Circus is upstate. I'm just waiting...

90
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,970
Follow up.

91
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,170
His father's probably with him. He covered for him once before.

92
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,270
He might have some information.

93
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,650
Do it. Yo, Detective!

94
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,710
Which escapee are you tracking?

95
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,990
Helzinger. No one's seen him.

96
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,400
He's six-seven, 275,

97
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,590
with the mind of a five-year-old.

98
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,810
Somebody's seen him.

99
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,960
What are you doing?

100
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,450
That stays up until we have her killer in custody.

101
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,900
- You understand? - Yes, sir.

102
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,760
Sarah Essen and nine of your brothers

103
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,480
were killed in this house.

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,070
In our house!

105
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,600
Their murderer stood right there, and he laughed at us.

106
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,880
Never forget that.

107
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,140
What?!

108
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,320
So how are you?

109
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,180
I'm fine.

110
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Really?

111
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,820
Look, I know Essen was your friend.

112
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,460
Lee, whatever you're about to say,

113
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,040
I know it's coming from a good place,

114
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,600
but I can't hear it right now.

115
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,340
So, the Gotham Children's Hospital gala is tonight,

116
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,060
which I helped organize.

117
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,630
I can't.

118
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,850
- You can't go? - No.

119
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,980
Even though a few hours away from all of this

120
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,120
might actually help?

121
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,920
Lee.

122
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,920
Okay. I just have to tell you something,

123
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,800
because if I don't and you find out,

124
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
you're gonna be pissed.

125
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,360
There's gonna be a magician.

126
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,480
Yeah. Right.

127
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,460
Stop beating yourself up.

128
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,480
- I'm trying. - I know you are.

129
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,020
I should have been here. I wasn't.

130
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,000
Stop it.

131
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,020
Kiss me.

132
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,170
Kiss me.

133
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,660
Better?

134
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,940
Not to interrupt your weirdly timed make-out session,

135
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,340
but Alvarez got in touch with the circus manager.

136
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,320
The blind fortune teller, Jerome's dad,

137
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,880
bailed on him, stayed in town.

138
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,050
Got an address.

139
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,300
- I'll call you. - Okay.

140
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,850
Who's there?

141
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,740
I know someone's there.

142
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,150
Hi-ya, Pops.

143
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,040
Long time... no see.

144
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,460
So, how you doing?

145
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,730
The silent treatment, eh?

146
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,260
Here, I'll tell you a story.

147
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,840
You remember Kansas City, Dad?

148
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,120
The circus went through town every spring

149
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,030
right around my birthday.

150
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,110
There was this guy.

151
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,820
Him and my mom used to drink and fornicate

152
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,890
and beat the crap out of me.

153
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,120
They'd make a whole night out of it.

154
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,420
And I remember one time--

155
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,450
It was my ninth birthday--

156
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,720
Him and my mom had just finished round one of

157
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,100
boozing, boning, beating up Jerome,

158
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,170
and were deciding to take a little break.

159
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,560
Anyway...

160
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,510
I was outside the trailer, and you were there.

161
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,980
And you said,

162
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,070
"Why are you crying, Jerome?"

163
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,080
"It's my birthday.

164
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,160
And my mom and the snake guy are beating me."

165
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,760
And then you said,

166
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,670
"This world doesn't care about you

167
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,890
"or anyone else, Jerome.

168
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,100
Better to realize that now."

169
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,060
And that was it.

170
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,920
You see, there's this guy, Dad.

171
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,790
He believes in me.

172
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,750
He thinks I'm gonna be a star.

173
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,170
And, tonight, all of Gotham will see that, too.

174
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,860
Except for you.

175
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,330
'Cause you'll be, you know, dead.

176
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,080
Jerome...

177
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,470
Is this the part where you say how sorry you are?

178
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,150
How you should have believed in me,

179
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,100
how it's not too late to start again?

180
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,520
News flash, Dad: it's too late.

181
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,660
You don't have to do this.

182
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,520
No.

183
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,460
I'm pretty sure I do.

184
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,880
I was a bad father, but I did love you.

185
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,700
To kill me for that...

186
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,880
That's not why I'm gonna kill you.

187
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,570
Plans to Arkham Asylum.

188
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,940
Look at these.

189
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,580
Letters between you and your troubled son.

190
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,630
Innocent at first glance, but Detective Gordon--

191
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,890
you remember him, right?--

192
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,260
he'll feel little bumps.

193
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,490
A secret message written in Braille

194
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,100
between you and your son, discussing my escape.

195
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,130
Finally, the knockout gas used to disable the orderlies.

196
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,260
'Cause, you see, Dad,

197
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,180
this guy I was telling you about,

198
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,870
he's the one who broke me out of Arkham.

199
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,590
He doesn't want anyone to know about that.

200
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,130
Obviously. So...

201
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,760
the police will find these letters,

202
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,240
and they'll think,

203
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,370
"The blind old fool really loved his son.

204
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,820
What a wonderful father."

205
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,900
There won't be a dry eye in the house.

206
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,090
They'll never believe it.

207
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,250
Sure, they will. Cops are dumb.

208
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,940
There's nothing to eat in this dump.

209
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,160
Finish up and let's go.

210
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
Sorry you're gonna miss my big night, Dad.

211
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,800
But, hey, you're psychic.

212
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,870
So, tell me,

213
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,200
do I kill?

214
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,470
You...

215
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,000
will be a curse upon Gotham.

216
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,400
Children will wake from sleeps screaming

217
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,310
at the thought of you.

218
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,460
Your legacy

219
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,360
will be death and madness.

220
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,070
Well...

221
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,490
say hi to Mom for me.

222
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
GCPD!

223
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,990
GCPD!

224
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,740
Mr. Cicero, it's Detective Gordon.

225
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,940
We need to speak with you about your son.

226
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,770
Mr. Cicero?

227
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,720
Mr. Cicero?!

228
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,930
Harvey, window!

229
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,420
Harvey?

230
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,380
Detective Gordon.

231
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,500
Old pal.

232
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,010
That gas sure packs a wallop, huh?

233
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,960
That's cute.

234
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,030
I'm sensing anger.

235
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,560
You killed Sarah Essen.

236
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,770
Now I'm gonna kill you.

237
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,720
Don't shoot him.

238
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,370
How about a little flesh wound?

239
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,310
No, no.

240
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,230
My dibs.

241
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,460
This is a waste of time.

242
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,610
We had a deal, didn't we, Master Bruce?

243
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,000
Part of which was you resume your normal lifestyle.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,490
Your parents were both patrons to the Children's Hospital.

245
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,360
Therefore, it makes you a patron.

246
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,360
Besides...

247
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,160
there's gonna be a magician.

248
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,680
And you like magicians, don't you?

249
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,910
No, I don't.

250
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,090
I hate magicians.

251
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,420
You know what I said about being normal?

252
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,750
Excuse me.

253
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm Lee Thompkins.

254
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,550
I work with James Gordon.

255
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,510
He's mentioned you, and I saw you and thought...

256
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,570
Of course. It's very nice to meet you.

257
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,280
Nice to meet you.

258
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,190
This is my guardian, Alfred Pennyworth.

259
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,600
It's an absolute pleasure.

260
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,270
Thank you.

261
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,620
How is Detective Gordon doing

262
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,530
since the attack on the precinct?

263
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,530
I was thinking I should call him.

264
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,880
He'd appreciate that.

265
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,600
Can I get you something to drink?

266
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,820
Uh, just water. Thank you.

267
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,570
So... I hear there's gonna be a magician.

268
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,700
Hello, Selina.

269
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,160
I-I didn't expect to see you here.

270
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,990
Well, you want to steal stuff,

271
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,850
it helps to go where the rich people are.

272
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,610
You do know this is a benefit for Children's Hospital?

273
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,800
So?

274
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,940
So these people are here for a good cause.

275
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,900
Me eating is a good cause.

276
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,390
Besides, didn't I steal something for you, once?

277
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,780
Selina, that was different.

278
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,830
Right.

279
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,450
How'd that go?

280
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,850
You get into that guy's safe?

281
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,290
Yes.

282
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,100
Though things didn't turn out quite like I planned.

283
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,100
A lot's happened since then.

284
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,440
Alfred says there's gonna be a magician.

285
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,390
I'm working.

286
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,080
And I hate magicians.

287
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,000
See you around, Bruce.

288
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,420
So you want to share your plan?

289
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,800
Remember I told you I could divine

290
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,960
the thing a person truly wants?

291
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,780
What Gotham wants is a hero.

292
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,730
And tonight...

293
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,270
I'm going to give them one.

294
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,070
Shall we?

295
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,040
Jerome and Tabby went on ahead.

296
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,690
Great cape.

297
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,210
Thank you for filling in on such short notice.

298
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,050
But how did you hear our magician dropped out,

299
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,850
Mr...?

300
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,370
Rodolfo.

301
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,500
Well, you know, magic.

302
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,380
Oh, I won't be needing that.

303
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,530
- Come on. - I'm sorry, but really, there is no mystery.

304
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,280
Tabitha, have you met Deputy Mayor Kane?

305
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,820
Harrison, this is my Tabitha.

306
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,350
Ah, nice to meet you.

307
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,720
Uh, and could you please tell your brother

308
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,950
that when a handsome billionaire appears out of nowhere,

309
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,270
people get curious.

310
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,520
Where'd he come from?

311
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,020
How'd he make his money?

312
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Who's he dating?

313
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,290
My wife would kill me if I don't get something--

314
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,720
a-a tidbit.

315
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,400
He's a monster in the sack.

316
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,320
Do you have any news of Mayor James?

317
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,880
No.

318
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,420
No, it's a real mystery.

319
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,120
We don't know where he is.

320
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,560
How intriguing.

321
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,210
Harrison, would you mind? A little family business.

322
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,530
Of course. Ms. Galavant.

323
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,080
Everything's ready.

324
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,890
See you at home.

325
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,090
So, uh, how do you go from being in the Royal Marines

326
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,880
to a butler?

327
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,830
Well, it's a bit tedious, really, after a while.

328
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,690
You know, parachuting into one global hot spot after another.

329
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,240
Warlords putting ridiculous bounties on your head.

330
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,840
Gets a bit boring, really.

331
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,720
You have amazing stories.

332
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,490
Yeah, well, you know, one or two.

333
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,860
You know, I don't really get nights off,

334
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,610
but if ever you'd like to pop by Wayne Manor

335
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,290
for dinner one evening, I...

336
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,410
Oh, that's very kind of you, Mr. Pennyworth, but...

337
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,400
No.

338
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,760
Alfred. Please. Alfred.

339
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,410
Alfred. That's very kind of you, but...

340
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,800
Now, having said that, I don't see why I can't take a night off,

341
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,830
and I... I happen to know

342
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,010
the head chef at Chez Parnes.

343
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,470
Well, I-I'm afraid I...

344
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,720
Did you say Chez Parnes?

345
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,060
I've been trying to eat there for quite some time.

346
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,110
You have the most beautiful eyes.

347
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,760
Okay, well, thank you,

348
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,970
but, uh...

349
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,180
Alfred, I'd like to leave.

350
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,150
Yeah, um...

351
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,490
What about Dr. Thompkins' water?

352
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,880
And, of course, you're gonna miss the magician.

353
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,210
Sorry, I must have forgotten your water.

354
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,510
Alfred, I still want to leave.

355
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,200
Are you not feeling well?

356
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,890
Oh, n-no, he's-he's absolutely fine. He's fine.

357
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,240
Why don't you just pop off to the bar,

358
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,670
Master Bruce, and...

359
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,040
show's about to start.

360
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,090
Is it time?

361
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,350
I roped myself into emcee duties for the night.

362
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,330
I hope you'll stay for the show.

363
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,040
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

364
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,930
What?

365
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,060
Good evening.

366
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm Dr. Lee Thompkins.

367
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,600
For the past five years,

368
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,620
I've had the honor of being part of the Children's Hospital.

369
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,660
Thank you for your support.

370
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,700
And thank you so much for coming out tonight.

371
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,330
Over the years, we've had magicians

372
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,220
come and entertain our children.

373
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,500
And so tonight, we have one of the magicians here for you.

374
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,420
Without further ado,

375
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,190
please allow me to present to you

376
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,890
the Great Rodolfo.

377
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,230
Greetings, ladies and germs!

378
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,750
I am indeed the Great Rodolfo.

379
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,900
Please ogle my lovely assistant.

380
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,990
For my first act, I'll require a volunteer.

381
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,970
Let me see.

382
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,250
Duck, duck,

383
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,490
duck, duck, duck, duck, duck...

384
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,140
goose!

385
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,350
Go on, Master Bruce.

386
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,580
Be a sport.

387
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,280
Don't keep the lady waiting.

388
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,360
Fine.

389
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,320
Hello, young man.

390
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,330
Does this

391
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,370
handsome gentleman have a name?

392
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,500
Bruce.

393
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,600
Bruce!

394
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,760
Well, Bruce, this won't hurt a bit.

395
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,900
Is there a doctor in the house?

396
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,160
No, just... Excuse...

397
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,050
Just wait! Wait!

398
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,910
Wait one second!

399
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,610
Go home.

400
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,050
I'm fine.

401
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,780
You've been running this since last night,

402
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,310
and you got a face full of that gas. Go home.

403
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,740
You going home?

404
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,790
I didn't think so.

405
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,630
Maybe I will go get some sleep.

406
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,120
Yeah? Good idea.

407
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,610
But we got somewhere, right?

408
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,640
At least now we know who broke Jerome out of Arkham.

409
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,840
Yeah. Crazy old blind man that lived alone.

410
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,240
The clever crazy old blind man.

411
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,000
If his father broke him out, why'd Jerome kill him, huh?

412
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,980
He was probably playing this maniac shtick

413
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,260
since you sent him away.

414
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,730
He was just a kid.

415
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,400
Every evil bastard in the world was just a kid once.

416
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,470
Yeah.

417
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,800
But I don't think it was his father that broke him out.

418
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
Well, cool.

419
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,020
Back to square one.

420
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,990
All right, I will go and get some sleep.

421
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,180
For the record,

422
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,670
I knew Essen a hell of a lot longer than you.

423
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,920
She saved my ass hundreds of times.

424
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,490
You really should go home.

425
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,380
First thing tomorrow, we'll go see Penguin.

426
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,500
You're right.

427
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,560
He's got his ears on the street.

428
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,760
Jim.

429
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,860
Never mind.

430
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,370
I'll see you tomorrow.

431
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,910
Give 'em a wave.

432
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,330
Some people say Bruce has a split personality.

433
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,470
Very good, Master Bruce.

434
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,260
For my next illusion,

435
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,020
I'd like to call to the stage esteemed Deputy Mayor

436
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,890
Harrison Kane.

437
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,220
Is there something familiar to you about those two?

438
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,950
Oh, my God.

439
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,020
Lee, I was just...

440
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,920
Jim, it's Barbara.

441
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,320
She's here. And-and I think maybe Jerome...

442
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,070
By the way, nobody here...

443
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,070
is getting out alive.

444
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,620
Right, Master Bruce, time to leave.

445
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,300
Selina!

446
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,480
Bruce!

447
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,150
You! What's going on?

448
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,030
Hostage situation.

449
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,210
The magician just killed the deputy mayor.

450
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,740
It's Jerome Valeska,

451
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,750
the same man that killed Commissioner Essen.

452
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,310
Who's in charge here?

453
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,710
I guess you are.

454
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,630
Lee.

455
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,900
Thank God. I've been trying to...

456
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,580
Sorry, Jimbo. It's just little old me.

457
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,450
Jerome.

458
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,830
Are you outside?

459
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,880
You are, aren't you?

460
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,310
Oh, goody!

461
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,990
I swear to God, if you've hurt her...

462
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,490
Breathe, James.

463
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,330
I haven't touched a hair on your girlfriend's pretty head.

464
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,440
See for yourself.

465
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,110
This is live television after all.

466
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,810
The feed just came back.

467
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,130
You son of a bitch.

468
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,110
True, but not the point.

469
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,150
Hey, let's talk about what I want.

470
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,410
Excuse me.

471
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,250
$47 million, a helicopter, obviously,

472
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,990
the dry cleaning I left at Mr. Chang's--

473
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,190
be careful, the man is a crook--

474
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,050
and, mm, I don't know, a pony.

475
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,400
You got ten minutes, or I start killing people.

476
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,270
Remember, this is being broadcast

477
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,260
to every home in Gotham, so, you know,

478
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,630
don't let people die. Bye.

479
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,430
I think that went well.

480
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,370
Enough!

481
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,330
You need to pack up your pathetic little sideshow and leave.

482
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,970
Is that right?

483
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,620
It may be presumptuous to speak for all the citizens of Gotham.

484
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,990
But we are sick of you!

485
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,460
You're a small,vicious man

486
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,740
with a pathetic need for attention.

487
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,400
Enough, man.

488
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,290
For God's sakes, enough.

489
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,100
I'm curious what your leverage is here, Mr...?

490
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,420
Theo Galavan.

491
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,640
Well, Mr. Theo Galavan,

492
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,810
if you don't sit down,

493
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,310
uh, I'm going to shoot you.

494
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,310
In the face.

495
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,960
I know there is some human decency left in you.

496
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,630
If you need to take a hostage, take me.

497
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,950
But let these people go home to their families,

498
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,690
to their children.

499
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,420
Boring.

500
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,740
Right?

501
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,700
Get your men. We're going in.

502
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,250
I used this to sneak into the party.

503
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,490
We're lucky those dummies didn't know about it.

504
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:30,980
Wait.

505
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,750
- We're almost outside. - Wait.

506
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,240
I have to go back.

507
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,170
Are you crazy? That guy was killing people!

508
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,480
Yes, and Alfred's back there.

509
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,170
I'm not going back.

510
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,410
I don't expect you to.

511
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,530
Selina...

512
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,870
I miss you.

513
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,540
I just wanted to say that.

514
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,390
You're refusing a direct order? I could have your stripes.

515
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,650
That maniac killed the commissioner.

516
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,560
Not my men. We're not equipped for this.

517
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,300
Fine. I'll go it alone.

518
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,770
Hold very still.

519
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,990
I can't look.

520
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,740
Someone tell me how it turns out.

521
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,610
Damn!

522
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,110
Turn around.

523
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,300
Well, clap!

524
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,570
So, Lee, how's Jim doing?

525
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,360
I hope he's not blaming himself

526
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,630
for this whole Essen being killed thing.

527
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,690
You are one crazy bitch.

528
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,290
So rude.

529
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,960
You know, I'm gonna... I'm gonna make a prediction.

530
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,700
Within a year, Jim and I will be back together.

531
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,150
Want to know why?

532
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,270
Because we're both the same.

533
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,740
We both have a dark side.

534
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,980
And one day, we will tell our grandchildren

535
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:38,510
about how this man-eating harpy almost tore us apart!

536
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,910
But in the end, love conquered all.

537
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,270
- You... - I'm sorry. What's that?

538
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,030
Hasn't been ten minutes. I need to buy you a watch.

539
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,440
Well...

540
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,410
I think it's time for tonight's first official victim,

541
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,920
you all know and love, poor rich boy,

542
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:11,290
parents murdered in an alley, and my favorite volunteer.

543
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:15,980
Where is... Bruce Wayne?!

544
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,120
You know I'm an orphan, too, Bruce?

545
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,510
I killed my parents though.

546
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,300
Where are you hiding?

547
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,510
Bruce!

548
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,050
Where are you, buddy?

549
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,800
Kill his butler.

550
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,510
Come on, move it, butler.

551
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,150
All right.

552
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,110
Last chance, Bruce,

553
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,160
but it's about to get very butler brainy out here.

554
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,330
D-Detective Gordon.

555
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,670
He's going to kill Alfred. I have to help him.

556
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,640
Brucey!

557
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,500
No. It's you he wants.

558
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,960
Bruce, just wants you.

559
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,540
I will not let him hurt Alfred.

560
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,580
I'm bored. Shoot the butler.

561
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,770
Stop!

562
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,180
What the bloody hell are you doing, Bruce?

563
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,140
There's a gun in my jacket.

564
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,500
Detective Gordon's behind the curtain.

565
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,850
Let's get this started, huh?

566
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,420
You, check behind the curtain;

567
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,540
make sure no one's playing silly buggers.

568
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,870
Drop the knife!

569
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,630
I don't have a clean shot!

570
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,180
Stay calm, Bruce.

571
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,840
Seems like we got ourselves a pickle.

572
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,760
What do you say, Brucey boy?

573
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,920
Want to boost our ratings, huh?

574
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,800
Smile.

575
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,920
I said, enough!

576
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,610
I know, I know.

577
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,020
This is not what we rehearsed.

578
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,140
I'm so sorry, Jerome.

579
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,980
You have real talent.

580
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,320
But now, you see,

581
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,770
the plot thickens.

582
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,980
Enter the hero.

583
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,080
You said...

584
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,690
I was gonna be...

585
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,210
Jim! Stop her!

586
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,450
...A pony.

587
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,430
See, someone like that has no interest in building things.

588
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,950
He's not part of a tradition.

589
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,900
It's chaos for chaos sake.

590
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,700
Perhaps I could use a new laugh.

591
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,580
Dude!

592
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,600
Color me impressed.

593
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,800
You know, if I close my eyes,

594
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,320
I can still see you holding Fish's umbrella.

595
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,280
"Yes, Ms. Mooney.

596
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,700
"No, Ms. Mooney. Whatever you say, Ms. Mooney.

597
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,500
That wig looks great on you, Ms. Mooney."

598
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,990
Seriously, the worm has turned.

599
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,390
Detective Bullock.

600
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,120
I heard you rejoined the force.

601
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,090
I am so happy.

602
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,330
But aren't you missing all of the excitement?

603
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,450
Yeah, I got the word too late.

604
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,890
Besides, I want to talk to you.

605
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,370
Of course.

606
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,520
Always happy to help.

607
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,910
See, there's talk on the street

608
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,990
that Jim Gordon did a favor for you,

609
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,840
collected a debt, and the guy ended up dead.

610
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,360
Rumors.

611
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,170
Rumors.

612
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,050
Well, then again, where there's smoke...

613
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,900
Jim shouldn't worry about that.

614
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,980
He and I are good friends.

615
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,060
Well, see, that's the problem, Oswald;

616
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,400
I think he is worried.

617
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,550
Because something happened today,

618
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,130
and you were the obvious person to come to.

619
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,560
And I sensed Jim was a little reluctant to come down here.

620
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,120
Like I said, he shouldn't worry.

621
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,180
As long as you two remain friends.

622
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,050
Exactly.

623
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,390
I got half a mind to take you outside

624
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,880
and beat you senseless with a garbage can.

625
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,540
Maybe some other time.

626
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,090
Call yourself whatever you want, man!

627
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,120
The King of Gotham.

628
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,840
But, to me, you'll always be that little umbrella boy.

629
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,020
And if you come after jim Gordon, you got to come after me.

630
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,970
And I still owe you for Fish.

631
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,400
But, seriously, this place is amazing.

632
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,730
Get me another drink!

633
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,560
You were very brave.

634
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,830
You helped save the lives of everyone in here.

635
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,850
Your parents, they would've been proud.

636
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,920
That they would've been.

637
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,310
They also would've given me the sack

638
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,390
for letting you do something so idiotic.

639
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,670
It was all of us.

640
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,830
We were a team.

641
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,640
Yeah. I guess we were.

642
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,670
Is he okay?

643
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,590
Fine. Though I'd still like him

644
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,920
to get checked out at the hospital.

645
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,300
Barbara gave him quite a knock.

646
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,660
Any word on her?

647
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,060
No, she went through a trapdoor in the stage.

648
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,650
They must have always been planning to use that as their exit.

649
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,430
Don't worry. We'll find her.

650
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,080
Uh, Mr. Galavan, sir.

651
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,780
Alfred Pennyworth.

652
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,440
I'd just like to thank you for saving

653
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,780
young Master Wayne's life.

654
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,300
If there's anything I can ever do for you, sir...

655
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,120
Or I.

656
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,870
I really just did what any citizen of Gotham would have done.

657
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,050
I wish that were true.

658
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,730
Jim Gordon.

659
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,310
Theo.

660
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,840
Well, if you ever need anything, please, call.

661
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,060
We're all in this together, right?

662
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,690
Thank you, sir.

663
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,680
Right, well, I suppose I better be getting this young man home.

664
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,330
It's been much more of an exciting evening

665
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,630
than originally planned.

666
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,410
I never did like magicians.

667
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,210
Good night.

668
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,730
It was very nice meeting you, Dr. Thompkins.

669
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,060
And you, Bruce.

670
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,330
Good night's sleep, you'll be right as roses.

671
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,840
I do hope we get to see you again soon.

672
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,130
Thank you.

673
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,490
Alfred.

674
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,470
Sure you're okay?

675
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,640
I'm fine.

676
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,030
Kiss me?

677
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,660
- Jim... - Kiss me.

678
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,670
- Oh, bugger. - Alfred.

679
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,620
- You knew, didn't you? - I didn't know, Alfred.

680
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,900
You did. You let me make a right mug of me-self.

681
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,170
Alfred, I had no idea.

682
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,560
- You did. - I didn't know.

683
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,630
Well, I didn't know.

684
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,060
Despite the presence of the GCPD,

685
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,190
it was billionaire Theo Galavan-- newly arrived in Gotham

686
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,830
but already making his name--

687
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,030
who stood up to the escaped lunatic.

688
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,720
Am I a hero?

689
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,570
Apparently.

690
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,800
I think tonight, the people of Gotham have said, "Enough."

691
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,330
the reign of tyranny is over.

692
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,930
Now the real fun begins.

693
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,240
Poor Jerome.

694
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,300
Yes, very sad.

695
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,490
Such a compelling character. But limited, you know?

696
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,030
He was never gonna last long.

697
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,120
I don't know about that.

698
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,500
The kid had a way about him.

699
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,730
Oh, poor baby,

700
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,180
did you get a bump?

701
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,290
...the killer, Jerome Valeska, is dead,

702
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,170
his murderous escapades left a deep impression on Gotham.

703
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,730
Nobody here is getting out alive.

704
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,590
Coming through.

705
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,020
You will be a curse upon Gotham.

706
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,740
Children will wake from sleep screaming

707
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,600
at the thought of you.

708
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:28,790
Your legacy will be death and madness.
