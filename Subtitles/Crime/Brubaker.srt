00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,847
Fresh out this morning.

191
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,213
Why don't you look around?

192
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,692
Are you finished
with that, Mr. Caldwell?

193
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,591
Two bits.

194
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,159
50 cents.

195
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,362
75.

196
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,371
What?

197
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,467
Sold.

198
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,649
You just cost me 50 cents...

199
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,811
that was needed elsewhere.

200
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,577
Go ahead. It's protein.

201
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,049
No, don't! Stop it!

202
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,214
No! Come on! Wait!

203
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,723
No! Please!

204
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,725
Don't! Stop it!

205
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,260
Let me go!

206
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,353
No!

207
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,733
No!

208
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,565
Let me go! Stop it!

209
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,395
[Whistles]

210
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,697
[Whistles]

211
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,762
Hey, Rob!

212
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,595
Where are you going
with those boys?

213
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,636
I need this stuff
started today.

214
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,365
My insurance company
wants an inventory.

215
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,805
Mr. Woodward,
I gave you 20 people...

216
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,639
and I'm down on my count.

217
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,145
I don't care
other people's problems.

218
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,238
All right.

219
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,375
I got you a nice
sirloin tip there.

220
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,118
Warden Renfro's
going to hear direct...

221
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,658
you don't come through for me.

222
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,284
Don't you worry.

223
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,686
This one, up.

224
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,312
Let's go.

225
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,958
Hey, I'll take it.

226
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,584
Thanks, man.

227
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,128
Hey, I do that.

228
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,727
I do that.

229
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,176
Where's my meat?

230
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,838
It's coming in back there.

231
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,112
You told me two steers.

232
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,155
That ain't two steers.

233
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,123
I couldn't do it
this week, Pink.

234
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,683
Suppose I couldn't spare beer?

235
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:39,322
I'll make it up to you, all right?

236
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,326
Where's Carol at?

237
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,031
Back at the house.

238
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,968
Back to the truck.

239
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:13,598
I'll give you
the name of the stoolie.

240
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,133
Give me back my dough.

241
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,102
Who told you to ask me?

242
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,639
The pin boy
in the bowling alley.

243
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,574
Who said to ask him?

244
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,941
The fella at the auction shop.

245
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,639
Oh, shit!

246
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,614
Wash your mouth out.

247
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,274
Ha ha ha!

248
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,618
What time are you
coming up there tonight?

249
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,123
My brother's got me working.

250
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,625
No, he doesn't.

251
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,459
I just bought you the night off.

252
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,276
What the hell you doing?
Move them logs.

253
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,249
You move them, asshole.

254
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,377
You're asking for it, boy.

255
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,820
Floyd!

256
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,056
Yeah, Huey?

257
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,430
You got them taking a nap, Floyd?

258
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,900
Get back to work!

259
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,960
Huey, don't get excited.

260
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,733
Take it easy, now.

261
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,774
Floyd, shut up, man.

262
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,741
Peanuts just went up to six bits.

263
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,142
They want you up at the bars, Bullen.

264
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:11,080
Who wants the last
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

265
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,743
Half a rock. Who wants it?

266
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,100
You got yourself a phone call.

267
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,102
Aw, fuck!

268
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,603
Look here, Eddie.

269
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:37,108
Eddie, why a phone call?

270
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,870
Let's go, Bullen.

271
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,640
Why a fucking phone call?

272
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,613
Hey.

273
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,243
What's with the phone call?

274
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:00,321
I'm getting ready to say
something important now.

275
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,130
I want to know
I'm being listened to.

276
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,035
I'm getting ready to
give out the detail.

277
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,005
Leonard, the kitchen.

278
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,702
Collins, slaughterhouse.

279
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,301
Sanitation detail.

280
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,243
You, too, Bullen.

281
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,474
This man is hurting...

282
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,484
You just deal with colored.

283
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,577
I'll handle the white folks.

284
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,015
Besides, I don't think
Bullen's got much more...

285
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,185
than refried shit
for brains this morning.

286
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:33,095
What about your boy, Boyd,
for clerical?

287
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,315
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.

288
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,811
[Coughing]

289
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,772
Hey!

290
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,944
I got this honky here!

291
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,550
I'll rip this cat's head off.

292
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,091
You get me the man! Now!

293
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,684
I can hear his neck snapping.

294
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,854
I want some respect!

295
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,998
You hear me?
I want some respect!

296
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,129
We hear you, Walter.

297
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,174
Get me the man!

298
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,709
I hear his neck snapping.

299
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,210
Open this.

300
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,439
You want in?

301
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,378
Yeah.

302
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,916
Some fucking respect around here.

303
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,345
?? R-E-S-P-E-C-T??

304
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,649
?? Find out what it means to me??

305
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,752
?? What you want??

306
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,058
?? A little respect??

307
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,122
?? What you need??

308
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,031
?? A little respect??

309
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,363
?? All I'm asking??

310
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,132
?? For a little respect
when you come home??

311
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:57,175
?? Baby, when you
come home????

312
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,506
Hey!

313
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,474
Can we talk?

314
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,448
Who the fuck are you?

315
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,451
I want the man!

316
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,578
I am the man.

317
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:13,886
I'm the new warden here.
My name is Henry Brubaker.

318
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,461
Don't be fucking with my head.

319
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,299
New warden, my ass!

320
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,429
It's true.

321
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,166
You look like a scumbag.

322
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,471
I'm fooling those guys out there.

323
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,773
Ha ha ha!

324
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,790
Ha ha ha!

325
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:54,123
Ha ha ha!

326
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:57,600
Ha ha ha!

327
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,866
When are you going
to paint this place?

328
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,099
What color?

329
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:08,605
Yellow, yellow.

330
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,113
Yellow.

331
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,912
I want a picture window
in my place.

332
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,351
This yours? This one?

333
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:21,757
And one of them
high-low pinto shag rugs...

334
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,989
and some liquor and a TV...

335
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,759
like them fucking
trusties all got.

336
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,727
And some fresh air.

337
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,699
Which wall?

338
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,274
Which wall, what?

339
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,246
The window.
The picture window.

340
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,783
Come on.
Show me exactly.

341
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:09,470
Maybe I want a skylight.

342
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,507
Yeah, I want...

343
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:13,599
I want a skylight.

344
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:17,772
Aah! Aah!

345
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:19,610
How you doing?

346
00:30:19,682 --> 00:30:22,879
Open this. Open it up!

347
00:30:22,952 --> 00:30:25,978
Get this man
some medical attention.

348
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:28,216
Get this place painted.

349
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,656
What color?

350
00:30:29,726 --> 00:30:32,524
Any fucking color he wants.

351
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:35,029
Everybody crazy around here.

352
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:36,861
My office.

353
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:41,502
Mess with me now,
you'll regret it later.

354
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:44,005
We don't work this thing out...

355
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:46,940
you won't be around later.

356
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,639
I can make
that tower guard blow you out.

357
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:53,682
Or you can continue
walking with me...

358
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,049
like the smart escort
I figure you to be.

359
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:14,626
Hey!

360
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,194
Hold it!

361
00:31:16,272 --> 00:31:17,671
I'm replacing you.

362
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,708
Coombes, give me a hand.

363
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:21,801
Call the governor.

364
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:23,607
Who is this asshole?

365
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,011
I don't know.

366
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,514
The name's Brubaker.

367
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:29,017
He thinks he's the new warden.

368
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:31,349
That's the way it is.

369
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:34,015
What is? What is, hmm?

370
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,820
You're Willets, Earl?

371
00:31:36,893 --> 00:31:37,882
Burl.

372
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,189
Burl, right.

373
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:41,890
State employee, purchasing agent.

374
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:43,557
You've been here, uh...

375
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:46,397
uh... three years next May.

376
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:48,130
Five years in July.

377
00:31:48,204 --> 00:31:50,263
Government service ranking
is seven.

378
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,276
You're due for
an in-grade raise in May?

379
00:31:54,344 --> 00:31:57,677
Yes, sir.
That part's all true.

380
00:32:02,685 --> 00:32:05,654
Captain, this is
a hell of a note.

381
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:07,019
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,648
I mean it.

383
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:10,852
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,035
I'll make sure
all your magazines get forwarded.

385
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:21,934
Don't worry.

386
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,209
Mr. Brubaker,
the smartest thing you ever done...

387
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:29,711
was come in here incognizant.

388
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:32,179
The dumbest was stepping forward.

389
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:35,547
You want it, you got it.

390
00:32:35,618 --> 00:32:36,949
Bye.

391
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:47,095
Can you hear me now?

392
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:49,631
Can you hear me?

393
00:32:49,699 --> 00:32:51,564
The name is Henry Brubaker.

394
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:55,331
I'm what the governor
promised... a reform warden.

395
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:59,068
That sneaks in like
James fucking Bond.

396
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:01,201
All right. Yeah!

397
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,738
Purcell, give me that.

398
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:11,348
See this?
This thing is gone.

399
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,826
Any trusty who wants
to go back to raking rocks...

400
00:33:17,894 --> 00:33:21,830
just get caught using this
on one of your charges.

401
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:25,299
If an inmate attempts an escape...

402
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:26,926
do we wave so long?

403
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:28,163
Shoot him.

404
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:29,295
What?

405
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:33,206
Shoot him.
Wound him if you can.

406
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:35,176
Nobody is getting paroled anymore...

407
00:33:35,244 --> 00:33:37,974
for trying to kill
escaping inmates.

408
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:41,349
Let's get something straight.

409
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:44,614
I figure most of you guys
belong here.

410
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:49,681
You don't have any respect
for other people or yourselves.

411
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,355
You want more from me,
you'll have to earn it.

412
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,958
We'll make this run
like a 20th-century farm.

413
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:02,630
You'll stop selling blood
to buy decent food.

414
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:04,696
You'll go out
and plant vegetables.

415
00:34:04,774 --> 00:34:07,334
Why you got your bubbles on?

416
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,844
Women can't come in here.

417
00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:13,109
It's all right, Ruben.

418
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:17,677
I don't want 15-hour shifts.

419
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:21,281
The beef raised here on this farm...

420
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:24,087
will be eaten by everyone.

421
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,128
What the...

422
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,664
Son of a bitch.

423
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:31,700
He was an army lieutenant.

424
00:34:31,768 --> 00:34:33,759
He ran a military stockade.

425
00:34:33,836 --> 00:34:35,167
Uh, to enforce...

426
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:37,138
This is ridiculous.

427
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:40,198
He taught penology
at Price University...

428
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:42,506
How old are you?

429
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:43,670
40.

430
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:45,680
To enforce state laws.

431
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:47,716
This is ridiculous.

432
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:49,752
It's "to enforce the laws..."

433
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:52,253
We've got angry...

434
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:55,222
...prison without taking
a loyalty oath.

435
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:57,122
To enforce state laws.

436
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:59,161
Enforce state laws.

437
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:02,163
To be respectful
to my superiors.

438
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,961
To be respectful
to my superiors.

439
00:35:05,034 --> 00:35:08,401
And to faithfully perform
the duties of this office.

440
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:10,905
No publicity on this.

441
00:35:10,973 --> 00:35:13,407
People are on your side.

442
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:14,875
It's strong stuff.

443
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:17,310
I mean it... no publicity.

444
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,711
I quite agree.

445
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:20,646
To be loyal to...

446
00:35:20,716 --> 00:35:23,810
I can't be kept in the dark...

447
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:25,979
on something like this.

448
00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:30,048
Chairman of the prison board
is expected to approve...

449
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:33,459
everything
pertaining to the prison.

450
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:37,966
I hope you won't scream
for free-world guards.

451
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:42,630
How long have you been on
the prison board?

452
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:44,673
17 years.

453
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,674
Print it.

454
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:51,669
What do you think
of our new warden?

455
00:35:51,747 --> 00:35:57,583
I wonder what his first order
of business will be.

456
00:35:57,653 --> 00:35:59,621
Blow the place up.

457
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:02,590
Start from scratch.

458
00:36:02,658 --> 00:36:06,059
You're making a joke, of course.

459
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,333
Of course.

460
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:14,995
Oh, yes.

461
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,483
Learn much?

462
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:30,917
Not enough.

463
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:33,148
I've never seen anything like this.

464
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:35,156
There isn't anything like this.

465
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:38,250
The problem isn't
just inside the prison.

466
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:41,353
That's why I have to move fast.

467
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,692
Carefully.

468
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,289
Same thing, Lillian.

469
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,198
Henry, this is very important.

470
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:48,931
No kidding.

471
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:55,003
You're one of the strangest
individuals I've ever seen.

472
00:36:55,077 --> 00:36:58,274
I've got an 11:00.
What's the problem?

473
00:36:58,347 --> 00:37:01,783
She said you're
the most punctual individual...

474
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:03,819
she's ever known.

475
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:05,319
I'll call you later.

476
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:07,447
I know you will.

477
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:13,958
Man, this is pathetic.

478
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,463
That's it, Purcell.

479
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:17,328
That's all I've got.

480
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,300
Well, you're out of luck.

481
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:22,303
I need a desk job, like you.

482
00:37:22,371 --> 00:37:23,838
Anyway, you's overworked.

483
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:26,568
It ain't up to me.

484
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:29,805
Purcell, can I see you a minute?

485
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:31,312
Yeah.

486
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,314
I got this...

487
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:37,819
I love what you did
with Deach out there.

488
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:41,323
A lot of people
will like that.

489
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,848
Who was that lady,
by the way?

490
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:47,327
The day I came in...

491
00:37:47,396 --> 00:37:50,832
trusties put a man on...
gunshot wound.

492
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,993
Uh-huh.

493
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:54,502
Is he OK?

494
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,094
What do you mean?

495
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:59,141
I mean, is he OK?

496
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:01,642
Is he back in the barracks?

497
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:04,874
I imagine he's at
the county hospital...

498
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:06,778
don't you?

499
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,476
Find out.

500
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:10,485
And could you get me...

501
00:38:10,553 --> 00:38:13,283
a dozen pair of sunglasses, please?

502
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:15,449
All right.

503
00:38:15,524 --> 00:38:17,958
You want them polarized or tinted?

504
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:20,996
You want the kind
with the little mirrors?

505
00:38:21,063 --> 00:38:22,997
People can't see in.

506
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:25,329
Makes them nervous as hell.

507
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:28,234
Just the regular glasses.

508
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:29,771
You got 'em.

509
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,844
Look, Captain, uh...

510
00:38:36,912 --> 00:38:38,971
Don't call me Captain.

511
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,316
Mr. Brubaker...

512
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:45,843
I know you're,
uh... probably getting ready...

513
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:49,015
to make some new
job assignments around here.

514
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:50,854
You'll probably even name...

515
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:53,588
your own warden's clerk.

516
00:38:53,663 --> 00:38:58,726
I'd like to, uh...
make a case for myself.

517
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:03,896
Uh...

518
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:09,276
Ha ha.

519
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:13,441
I know I'm not
the smartest guy in the world...

520
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:15,950
but I do know this job.

521
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:18,452
And I know this damn place...

522
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:21,752
better than any man here,
and that's a fact.

523
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:24,486
I've been the warden's clerk
for eight years.

524
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,221
I know it.

525
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:30,632
What you got here, mainly...

526
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,327
are rural people...

527
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,801
you know what I mean?

528
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,839
They're not much at paperwork.

529
00:39:37,907 --> 00:39:39,807
No sophistication.
They...

530
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:43,311
I'm not trying to
put anybody down.

531
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:45,347
Don't get me wrong.

532
00:39:45,414 --> 00:39:50,113
I'm just telling you
the way it is.

533
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:53,121
What are you in for, Purcell?

534
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:55,749
Nothing, really. L...

535
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:57,383
Nothing?

536
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,020
I held up a card game.

537
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:01,495
Ha ha.

538
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,191
Pretty stupid, huh?

539
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:06,325
Undoubtedly they were cheating you?

540
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:07,994
Absolutely.

541
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:11,429
That's a fact.

542
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:17,845
Anyway, uh...

543
00:40:17,913 --> 00:40:21,314
you need something,
I'm your man, OK?

544
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:24,581
Well, just the sunglasses for now.

545
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:26,018
You got 'em.

546
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:28,181
They all for you?

547
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:29,622
None for me.

548
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:32,752
Got you.

549
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:37,524
What are you going to do
about my parakeet?

550
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,568
Abraham, come on.

551
00:40:39,635 --> 00:40:41,535
Tell your story walking.

552
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:44,038
Yeah, I know.
Your poor bird.

553
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:45,539
Roy, Roy.

554
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:48,577
Do I get the desk job?

555
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:51,579
I got a desk job for you.

556
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,046
Spell ophthalmology.

557
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:55,083

not every six months.

that weapon aside?

How about you

while trying to escape
a reformatory.

581
00:42:59,508 --> 00:43:03,444
They shot Hollis
and laid him on the tracks...

582
00:43:03,512 --> 00:43:06,242
so the train would squash him...

583
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:08,749
and make it look like an accident.

I got picked up
for vagrancy... misdemeanor.

603

The next morning,
the toilet's broken.

There's six men in the cell...

605

00:51:36,257 --> 00:51:37,918
I can't afford no more.

743
00:51:37,992 --> 00:51:39,619
Shut up!

744
00:51:39,694 --> 00:51:41,924
What did he say?

745
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:43,554
Nothing.

746
00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:47,934
I can't afford no more!

747
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:49,435
Shut up!

748
00:51:49,504 --> 00:51:51,404
What's going on here?

749
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:53,702
Nothing.
What's wrong with you?

750
00:51:53,775 --> 00:51:56,369
You're charging for
medical attention?

751
00:51:56,444 --> 00:51:57,809
Who?

752
00:51:57,879 --> 00:51:58,846
You!

753
00:51:58,913 --> 00:52:00,278
Why are you so excited?

754
00:52:00,348 --> 00:52:02,373
We've been charging for years.

755
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:07,353
Get your hands off me!

756
00:52:07,422 --> 00:52:09,890
You call yourself a doctor?

757
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,892
Get your... Crazy man!

758
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,258
You're a crazy man!

759
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:16,354
Crazy fool!

760
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:37,877
Zaranska, this is
your hospital now.

761
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:40,079
What? Hell, l...

762
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:42,884
Until we can get a real doctor.

763
00:52:42,957 --> 00:52:45,721
I don't know shit
about hospitaling.

764
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:49,593
You know more than I do.
Work with me.

765
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:22,856
Looking good, Warden.

766
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:25,329
Willets...

767
00:53:25,399 --> 00:53:27,333
you just took delivery...

768
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:30,495
on 300 cases
of chili last week.

769
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,504
Where are they now?

770
00:53:32,572 --> 00:53:36,008
No. I just looked in the locker.

771
00:53:36,076 --> 00:53:38,010
The boys gobble it up?

772
00:53:38,078 --> 00:53:40,046
Not the rank men.

773
00:53:40,113 --> 00:53:42,513
There's only 50 trusties.

774
00:53:42,582 --> 00:53:45,050
That comes to 7,200 cans...

775
00:53:45,118 --> 00:53:47,052
divided by 50 trusties.

776
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,554
That comes to 144 cans.

777
00:53:49,623 --> 00:53:52,592
You correct me if I'm wrong.

778
00:53:52,659 --> 00:53:55,253
You're going too fast for me.

779
00:53:55,328 --> 00:53:57,990
Divided by seven days...

780
00:53:58,065 --> 00:54:02,024
that comes to
20.5 cans of chili...

781
00:54:02,102 --> 00:54:04,002
per trusty per day.

782
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:06,539
Does that tell you anything?

783
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:08,039
Willets?

784
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:10,372
Are you alive, Willets?

785
00:54:10,444 --> 00:54:12,639
No, sir.

786
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:14,373
The roof just fell in.

787
00:54:14,448 --> 00:54:16,348
People are starving.

788
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:19,544
Where's all the food
going around here?

789
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:21,052
Purcell.

790
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:22,520
Sir?

791
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:25,057
Regulation outfits from now on...

792
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:28,060
or prison-issue pants,
boots, and shirts.

793
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:30,653
We don't have any boots.

794
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,220
Well, order them.

795
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:34,028
That's Willets' area...
acquisition.

796
00:54:34,101 --> 00:54:36,069
No, you order them.

797
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:38,661
I need about 700 pairs...

798
00:54:38,738 --> 00:54:41,036
and no more shaved heads!

799
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:43,542
Yeah. But sizes!

800
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:44,736
You know that.

801
00:54:44,811 --> 00:54:46,904
Yes. I'll be ready.

802
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,575
God damn, look at you...
new blood.

803
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:53,448
That's what this place needs.

804
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,044
You're Brubaker, right?

805
00:54:55,122 --> 00:54:56,180
Right.

806
00:54:56,256 --> 00:54:59,487
You don't look like no warden.

807
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:03,028
Chocolate prune cake in there.

808
00:55:03,096 --> 00:55:06,327
My missus baked it up
special for you.

809
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:10,062
I hate prunes.
They cloud my mind.

810
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:12,833
Did I say my name?

811
00:55:12,906 --> 00:55:16,205
No. But I know you.

812
00:55:16,276 --> 00:55:18,301
C.P. Woodward.
Call me Woody.

813
00:55:18,378 --> 00:55:19,970
Can I help you?

814
00:55:20,046 --> 00:55:21,707
Roof.

815
00:55:21,781 --> 00:55:23,646
What?

816
00:55:23,717 --> 00:55:26,345
I came about the roof.

817
00:55:26,419 --> 00:55:27,943
Purcell said you'd declared...

818
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:31,684
a state of emergency or something.

819
00:55:32,759 --> 00:55:37,093
I thought you just sell lumber.

820
00:55:37,164 --> 00:55:40,361
I sell it, I grow it.

821
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:42,924
I got wood in my veins.

822
00:55:43,003 --> 00:55:45,597
Just give me yourJohn Hancock.

823
00:55:45,672 --> 00:55:48,664
We'll fix things up tight.

824
00:55:48,742 --> 00:55:50,437
No. Hold it, now.

825
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,707
Shouldn't you see
the roof first?

826
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,873
Whatever we find, we'll fix.

827
00:55:55,949 --> 00:56:02,218
You get one pinprick hole
in that tarpaper from the factory...

828
00:56:02,289 --> 00:56:04,723
This isn't a question of pinpricks.

829
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:07,282
You built that thing wrong...

830
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,921
and I want you to rebuild it.

831
00:56:10,997 --> 00:56:12,726
Of course you do.

832
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,563
I'll help with the cost.

833
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:17,728
I'll bill only my materials.

834
00:56:17,804 --> 00:56:19,897
This won't cost me anything.

835
00:56:19,973 --> 00:56:21,907
You guarantee your work?

836
00:56:21,975 --> 00:56:23,442
Of course.

837
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:28,277
You get on top
of this shit pile...

838
00:56:28,348 --> 00:56:30,816
and then the job's
not such a ballbuster.

839
00:56:30,884 --> 00:56:33,284
You'll be happier then.

840
00:56:33,353 --> 00:56:34,843
I'm not complaining.

841
00:56:34,921 --> 00:56:36,684
Are you unhappy?

842
00:56:36,756 --> 00:56:39,691
It sure sounds like it to me.

843
00:56:50,237 --> 00:56:52,933
I'm not in this business for my health.

844
00:56:53,006 --> 00:56:54,940
Or anybody else's.

845
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:56,737
I'm doing my inventory.

846
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,677
It's a pain in the ass.

847
00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:03,409
Ain't been anybody from Wakefield
helping me lately.

848
00:57:03,483 --> 00:57:06,611
We're not sending
convicts to you anymore.

849
00:57:06,686 --> 00:57:08,916
That's slave labor.

850
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:10,889
It is not.

851
00:57:10,957 --> 00:57:13,187
You got it all backwards...

852
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,387
because this is a community.

853
00:57:15,462 --> 00:57:17,453
The people around here...

854
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,395
don't ostracize this prison.

855
00:57:19,466 --> 00:57:21,093
We accept it.

856
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,395
We cooperate.

857
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:24,937
It's a two-way street.

858
00:57:25,005 --> 00:57:28,406
You'll see a lot of nice things...

859
00:57:28,475 --> 00:57:32,741
from people in
the farm supply business...

860
00:57:32,812 --> 00:57:34,109
clothing business...

861
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,579
Lumber business.

862
00:57:35,649 --> 00:57:37,412
Yeah. Take that cake.

863
00:57:37,484 --> 00:57:41,284
The point ain't whether
you like prune.

864
00:57:41,354 --> 00:57:43,481
It's the thought that counts.

865
00:57:43,556 --> 00:57:45,319
Exactly.

866
00:57:45,392 --> 00:57:48,987
Just accept the stuff,
keep your mouth shut...

867
00:57:49,062 --> 00:57:51,189
and let things run...

868
00:57:51,264 --> 00:57:54,597
like they've been
going for 100 years...

869
00:57:54,668 --> 00:57:56,431
before we was born.

870
00:57:56,503 --> 00:57:58,903
I'm talking about tradition.

871
00:57:58,972 --> 00:58:00,963
Don't fuck with tradition.

872
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:03,305
Count your own woodpile, Woody.

873
00:58:03,376 --> 00:58:05,640
I'll fix my own roof.

874
00:58:05,712 --> 00:58:09,580
A lot of people will be
disappointed in you.

875
00:58:09,649 --> 00:58:12,447
It won't be the first time.

876
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:14,077
I hope you're right.

877
00:58:14,154 --> 00:58:15,712
Take this.

878
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:20,453
Get me all the contracts on that roof.

879
00:58:20,527 --> 00:58:22,586
I want everything.

880
00:58:22,662 --> 00:58:24,755
Whose team you on?

881
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:26,765
What can I say?

882
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:28,767
He's the coach.

883
00:58:28,835 --> 00:58:30,462
Short season.

884
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:41,305
Oh, no, it's no secret.

885
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:43,815
They write it all down.

886
00:58:43,883 --> 00:58:45,817
Prison lumber and labor...

887
00:58:45,885 --> 00:58:48,820
is building people's swimming pools.

888
00:58:48,888 --> 00:58:50,185
That's right.

889
00:58:50,256 --> 00:58:55,125
My trusty is loading our food
into state police cars.

890
00:58:55,195 --> 00:58:56,924
It runs that deep?

891
00:58:56,996 --> 00:59:00,659
We're stepping on more toes
than I imagined.

892
00:59:02,402 --> 00:59:04,336
What's that?

893
00:59:06,806 --> 00:59:08,774
I'm just warning you...

894
00:59:08,842 --> 00:59:11,936
because you're likely
to start hearing things.

895
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:16,277
I'll be ready to run
interference for you.

896
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:18,783
I'll talk to the governor.

897
00:59:18,852 --> 00:59:22,447
Can I call you back?

898
00:59:22,522 --> 00:59:23,784
Uh-huh.

899
00:59:23,857 --> 00:59:25,415
Bye.

900
00:59:25,492 --> 00:59:27,016
[Dial Tone]

901
00:59:43,143 --> 00:59:45,976
Give me some of that stuff.

902
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:43,897
Where, uh, where's Huey Rauch?

903
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,562
I don't see him around.

904
01:01:16,169 --> 01:01:18,262
Smell this.

905
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:23,870
I'm a city boy.

906
01:01:23,943 --> 01:01:25,069
Purcell?

907
01:01:32,385 --> 01:01:34,785
That smells like kerosene.

908
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:17,091
This animal's been shot.

909
01:02:17,163 --> 01:02:19,825
You know anything about it?

910
01:02:21,668 --> 01:02:24,694
What about that truck out there?

911
01:02:24,771 --> 01:02:26,796
Looked like a free worlder.

912
01:02:49,629 --> 01:02:51,620
Now what are these?

913
01:02:51,698 --> 01:02:54,258
I don't know.

914
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:58,931
Shacks.

915
01:02:59,005 --> 01:03:01,473
Are they on our property?

916
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:03,475
Let me think.

917
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:08,909
Honestly...

918
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:10,381
Yeah!

919
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:12,111
I think.

920
01:03:12,185 --> 01:03:13,709
Shit.

921
01:03:18,891 --> 01:03:23,157
I don't know who's in there
or what you're up to...

922
01:03:23,229 --> 01:03:26,790
but we got the new warden,
and we're probably coming in!

923
01:03:26,866 --> 01:03:29,061
Right?

924
01:03:31,004 --> 01:03:33,131
[Voices]

925
01:03:33,206 --> 01:03:35,697
Probably nobody home.

926
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:38,403
I ain't hiding in the dark...

927
01:03:38,478 --> 01:03:41,038
like no human insect.

928
01:03:44,984 --> 01:03:46,747
Yeah? What?

929
01:03:46,819 --> 01:03:49,344
Good morning.

930
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:50,411
Morning.

931
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:54,586
Get out here
and take care of this.

932
01:03:54,661 --> 01:03:57,892
Excuse me, I have
a tight schedule.

933
01:03:57,964 --> 01:04:01,661
[Television]... like some animal
with one thing on his mind.

934
01:04:01,734 --> 01:04:05,602
Oh, Mother,
even kids can have sex.

935
01:04:05,672 --> 01:04:08,106
Is that what
you do at parties?

936
01:04:08,174 --> 01:04:10,506
How many out there?

937
01:04:10,576 --> 01:04:12,066
Three, four.

938
01:04:12,145 --> 01:04:15,080
I don't want you
getting a reputation.

939
01:04:15,148 --> 01:04:16,809
Pull it up.

940
01:04:16,883 --> 01:04:20,944
I already have one.
The wrong kind.

941
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:24,148
Marry a man
who respects you.

942
01:04:24,223 --> 01:04:28,182
I want you to have
a good name.

943
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:30,821
You.! You want.!

944
01:04:30,897 --> 01:04:33,798
Is that all
you can say?

945
01:04:33,866 --> 01:04:38,064
Uh... you want a beer
or something?

946
01:04:38,137 --> 01:04:40,833
Don't talk
like that again.!

947
01:04:47,613 --> 01:04:50,548
The improved Veg-o-Matic
stretches food dollars.

948
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:52,550
Millions bought at $ 7.77.

951
01:04:56,856 --> 01:04:58,824
Where's your wallet at?

952
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:00,722
Veg-o-Matic can cut
a whole, fiirm tomato...

953
01:05:00,793 --> 01:05:03,091
in one stroke.!

954
01:05:03,162 --> 01:05:05,960
That's my personal property.

955
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:08,626
I'm going.

956
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:12,102

01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:15,402

958
01:05:19,378 --> 01:05:21,642
Let me give you...

959

I got it. I got it.

960
01:05:30,923 --> 01:05:34,984
Hot dog!
Look what we got here.

961
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:38,121
That be Warden Renfro's
monthly supply.

962
01:05:38,197 --> 01:05:41,792
Man took baths in that stuff.
