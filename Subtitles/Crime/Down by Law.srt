or do you say in English,
"I looka out the window"?

1022
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,705
You laugh. He died.

1023
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,541
What was he like?

1024
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:12,002
- He was wonderful. Yes.
- [Laughing]

1025
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:16,924
He won this place playing cards,
and he was afraid to lose it again...

1026
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:19,468
so he gave me like a present.

1027
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:22,388
- Uh-huh.
- But I didn't know what to do with this.

1028
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:26,100
And one day -

1029
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:29,812
it was a very particular day -

1030
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:33,941
like out of the blue, my boyfriend left me.

1031
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:36,860
- Aw.
- Yes. It was my birthday.

1032
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:38,445
- Aw.
- Yes.

1033
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:40,447
And Uncle Luigi died.

1034
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:42,616
- Oh, no.
- All in the same day.

1035
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:46,745
So in the same day, I left Italy
and I come to live here.

1036
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:51,667
- You know?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

1037
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:55,921
And now I have falled in love, at last.

1038
01:33:56,756 --> 01:34:00,092
Ah? I have finded my new home.

1039
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:03,304
She has asked to me if I stay here...

1040
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:06,849
to live together with her forever and ever.

1041
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:09,935
- Like in a book for children.
- Yes.

1042
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,186
No.

1043
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:23,157
Well, how did you learn how to speak English?

1044
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,367
Oh, yes. I speak pretty well...

1045
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:28,704
but I know nothing
about English for restaurant.

1046
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:31,999
Like food, good plate, nice dish -

1047
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,792
these word I don't know.

1048
01:34:34,878 --> 01:34:38,339
Well, Bob should come in handy there.
He speaks good restaurant English.

1049
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:41,592
- Yes.
- Yes, my killer.

1050
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,765
Mmm. Mmm!

1051
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:56,440
Well, that's just great, Bob.

1052
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:58,859
Yeah, congratulations.

1053
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,070
- Do you know where we are?
- Louisiana.

1054
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,405
- No, I know Louisiana, but -
- Yes.

1055
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:06,450
Near the border of Texas.

1056
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:10,537
Ah! You see? Texas. I knew this, eh?

1057
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:15,125
Texas near. [Laughs]
Remember?

1058
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:18,003
- Well, I propose a toast.
- Yes, thank you.

1059
01:35:18,088 --> 01:35:20,631
- To Bob and Nicoletta.
- [Laughs]

1060
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,926
- Oh, my friends.
- Thank you.

1061
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:25,219
Thank you.

1063
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:44,696
Ah.

1064
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:48,283
Ah, you look good
in my Uncle Luigi clothes.

1065
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:50,744
- Oh-ho.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1066
01:35:50,829 --> 01:35:52,287
Great.

1067
01:35:57,127 --> 01:36:00,587
Say, uh, you don't have a car
or anything, do you?

1068
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:04,675
Car, no. But I will save to buy one
and learn to drive.

1069
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:07,553
- I've only my bicycle.
- Ah.

1070
01:36:07,637 --> 01:36:12,975
But there's a man who brings things
I need from town once a week or so.

1071
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,605
[Laughs]

1072
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:21,358
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1073
01:36:21,901 --> 01:36:24,903
- More Uncle Luigi clothes.
- Yes.

1074
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:27,489
Very sporty, Jack.

1075
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:34,538
So, but you are sure you must leave today?

1076
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:39,293
Why we cannot stay here for some times first?

1077
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:42,504
Well, it's too dangerous out there, Bob.

1078
01:36:42,589 --> 01:36:44,965
There's probably an A.P.B. Out on all of us.

1079
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,718
Nah, I'm sure we're gonna make it.

1080
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:52,097
Well, we're gonna have to keep going.

1081
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:56,935
At least now we know where we are.

1082
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,146
And where do you go now?

1083
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,107
- I'll probably head out west.
- Hmm.

1084
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:03,901
Out to Los Angeles.

1085
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:09,156
And you, my friend, Jack? Where do you go?

1086
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:13,202
Well, if he's going to L.A.,
I'm gonna go east. You know what I mean?

1087
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:14,828
- Yes. [Mumbles]
- Yes.

you will come to a place
where it becomes two roads.

1117
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:47,022
On the right will go east.
On the left will go west.

Uh, no. On the right will go west.

1119
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:57,449
Uh, no. I'm not sure.
Anyway, there is a sign to tell you.

1120

to the right goes west.
