CITY OF GOD

00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:46,359
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

3
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,162
Go on, for fuck's sake!

4
00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:57,400
Get that chicken!

5
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:14,052
If it 's a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.

6
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,419
- You think so, Rocket?
- Gotta take the risk.

7
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:21,257
You'd risk your life
for a picture? Forget it!

8
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,166
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

9
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:30,072
Get that chicken, bro!

10
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,369
Motherfucker! I told you
to grab that chicken!

11
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,707
Outta my way!

12
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,917
Get that chicken!

13
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:01,266
If Li'I Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

14
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:05,905
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.

15
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:18,481
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Get that chicken!

16
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:22,356
Shit! The cops!

17
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,824
Don't fucking run off!

18
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:26,826
Give me that.

19
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,901
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

20
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,461
<i>A picture could change</i>

21
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:38,938

22
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:43,002
<i>... and if you stay</i>, <i>they get you too.</i>
- They're coming for us!

23
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:45,876
<i>It's been that way</i>
<i>ever since lwas a kid...</i>

24
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:52,521
THE SIXTIES

25
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:00,863
You're useless, man!

26
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,898
- Go get the ball!
- Fucking useless!

27
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:08,198
Hey, kid!

28
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:11,432
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

29
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:16,771
- It 's not yours.
- You wanna mess with me?

30
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,415
Fuck off.

31
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:23,781
- What 's your name?
<i>- Sorry,I forgot to introduce myself.</i>

32
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:26,513
- My name's Rocket.
- Some advice, Rocket...

33
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,288
Don't let Li'I Dice
touch that ball. He sucks.

34
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,786
- You lose, pal.
- Go, Shaggy!

35
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:35,227
<i>That's Shaggy.</i>

36
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:38,834
<i>To tell the story of the Clty of God</i>,
<i>I have to start wlth him.</i>

37
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:41,061
8, 9, 1O, 11...

38
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,743
<i>But in orderto tell Shaggy's story</i>, <i>I</i>
<i>must tell the story of the Tender Trio.</i>

39
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:51,142
Well, Shaggy? The gas truck's coming.
What are you fucking around for?

40
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:53,283
You're not gonna chicken out...

41
00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:00,148
THE STORY OF THE TENDER TRIO

42
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,288
<i>The notorious Tender Trio</i>
<i>was legendary in the Clty of God.</i>

43
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,058
<i>Shaggy...</i>

44
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,430
<i>Clipper...</i>

45
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:15,572
<i>and Goose.</i>

46
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:21,239
<i>Tagging alongwere always</i>
<i>Li'I Dice and Benny...</i>

47
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:23,379
<i>Shaggy's brother.</i>

48
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,312
<i>I never had the courage</i>
<i>to follow my brother,Goose.</i>

49
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,862
Okay, let 's go.

50
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,657
Come on, Goose.

51
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,423
Let 's go!

52
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,379
Stop! Stop!
Stop this fucker!

53
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:03,985
Stop or I'll shoot, motherfucker!

54
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,486
Get out!

55
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:11,954
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

56
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,824
Who wants gas?

57
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:26,934
More! You wanna die for your
boss' damn money?

58
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:29,135
Shitloads of money here!

59
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:33,580
You see, asshole?

60
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:35,745
Asshole!

61
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,921
Fuck! The cops!

62
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,352
Let 's get outta here!

63
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:51,129
Clear out! The place is
crawling with cops!

64
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:10,148
- Shaggy!
- The ball, Goose, it 's yours!

65
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,692
<i>Back then,I thought</i>
<i>the guys in the Tender Trio...</i>

66
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,061
<i>were the most dangerous hoods</i>
<i>in Rio.</i>

67
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:28,705
Here! Buy some new balls.

68
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:33,709
<i>But they were just amateurs.</i>

69
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,573
<i>- Even my brother,Goose.</i>
- Rocket, give this money to dad.

70
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,052
But don't tell him it 's from me.

71
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:47,486
Okay?

72
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,684
- Hey, Stringy!
- Yeah?

73
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,159
Look how much I've got.

74
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:13,379
<i>We came to the Clty of God</i>
<i>hoping to find paradise.</i>

75
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:18,248
<i>Many families were homeless</i>
<i>due to flooding...</i>

76
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:20,856
<i>and acts of arson</i>
<i>in the ghettos.</i>

77
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:23,993
- A light post!
- We'll have electricity!

78
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,356
<i>The bigwigs in government</i>
<i>didn't joke around.</i>

79
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:29,499
<i>Homeless? 0ff to Clty of God!</i>

80
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,761
<i>There was no electriclty</i>,
<i>paved streets ortransportation.</i>

81
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:37,168
<i>But forthe rich and powerful</i>
<i>our problems didn't matter.</i>

82
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:40,377
<i>We were too far removed...</i>

83
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:43,046
<i>from the picture postcard image</i>
<i>of Rio de Janeiro.</i>

84
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:02,494
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

85
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,531
I don't know.

86
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:07,602
Being a lifeguard is better
than a fishmonger.

87
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:10,330
I don't want to sell fish.
It stinks.

88
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,241
- Are you insulting your father?
- No.

89
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:16,947
So what do you want to be?

90
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:18,975
I don't know.

91
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,777
- Not a hood or a policeman.
- Why not?

92
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:25,148
I'm scared of getting shot.

93
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:32,095
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?

94
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:35,788
Pointing that gun at me?

95
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,231
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li'I Dice is with me.

96
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:42,270
Right, I'm a gangster too.

97
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:45,101
- That gas truck didn't bring much.
- So what?

98
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:48,938
- We rob gas trucks every day.
- One today, another tomorrow.

99
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,441
No, we need to rob
some rich guy's house.

100
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,083
That 's the only
way to get outta here.

101
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:57,584
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

102
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,221
That 's it.

103
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:03,519
The little fart 's getting
too big for his britches!

104
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,834
He gets high and starts
talking bullshit.

105
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:18,202
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

106
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,070
What you got in mind, Li'I Dice?

107
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,876
<i>To be a real hood you need</i>
<i>more than just a gun. You need ideas.</i>

108
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:33,181
<i>And Li'I Dice had them.</i>

109
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,849
- Is that the motel?
- Yeah.

110
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:41,994
We go in, grab the money and
get out. No killing, got that?

111
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:45,532
- I need this.
- Don't touch my gun, kid.

112
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:46,930
Don't ever do that again.

113
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:48,729
- Don't point at me.
- Fuck you.

114
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:52,602
- Don't point your finger at me!
- Stop acting like a baby!

115
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,504
Here's yours.

116
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:57,112
- Awesome!
- Let 's go!

117
00:11:57,314 --> 00:11:59,839
- Not so fast!
- What?

118
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,518
You stay here and keep watch.

119
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:08,088
If the cops come, shoot that
window over there.

120
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,193
- Why me? Let that dork do that.
- Look...

121
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:16,594
I gave you this great plan, for free...
While that guy's absolutely useless!

122
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,563
- You just had the idea.
- Exactly!

123
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:21,260
You're just a kid, remember?

124
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:24,602
You cover us, okay?

125
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:30,376
You'll get your turn, so cool it.
Stop trying to rush things.

126
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:33,072
You stay there.

127
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:40,015
This is a hold-up, bitch.

128
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:49,794
You should be studying or working.
You don't even look like hoodlums.

129
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,993
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

130
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:57,071
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!

131
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,805
Okay, Clipper?

132
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,244
Shall we go in?

133
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:10,850
I didn't order anything.

134
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:15,185
It 's on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

135
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:17,656
Keep calm, all I want
is your cash.

136
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:19,453
- Don't point that...
- Your wallet...

137
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,399
Hey, man...

138
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,806
What kind of whorehouse is this?

139
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:41,609
- You from the church?
- Yes, brother.

140
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:45,677
Give it to me!

141
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,188
Slut!

142
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,223
You're old, fat and flabby!

143
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:54,494
Wanna take her place?

144
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:01,130
What 's going on?

145
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:04,968
- The cops! Let 's beat it!
- Let 's go!

146
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:13,606
Take that car.
I'll go get Li'I Dice.

147
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,419
Jesus, what a car!

148
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,161
- Something fucked up. Li'I Dice's gone.
- The cops are shooting, let 's go!

149
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:57,592
Slow down! Hold on...

150
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:00,628
- You said you knew how to drive.
- I do, so cool it!

151
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,527
Turn! Watch out!

152
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,910
You fucking asshole!

153
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:22,679
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

154
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:26,515
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?

155
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:33,195
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

156
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:35,729
Goose fucked up his ankle.

157
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:36,922
It fucking hurts.

158
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:41,036
Take him into the woods.
I'll shoot to distract the cops.

159
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:43,570
- In God we trust.
- In God we trust.

160
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,743
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

161
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:54,850
<i>Shorty is another notorious guy</i>
<i>in the Clty of God.</i>

162
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:57,077
<i>But It's not yet time</i>
<i>to tell his story.</i>

163
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:02,982
- It fucking hurts, Goose.
- Shut up.

164
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:08,427
- Wait up...
- You sound like a damn sissy, man.

165
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:15,767
- Give me your hand! Climb up!
<i>- No one saw anything?</i>

166
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:20,807
How odd! A car crashes
into a bar and no one saw a thing.

167
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:24,003
I suppose you didn't see
anything either?

168
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:27,945
As usual, no one saw,
no one knows.

169
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:32,143
So what 's up, Shorty?

170
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:35,587
They're hiding in the woods.

171
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:38,254
- Hello, Melonhead.
- How are you doing?

172
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:41,898
I have this feeling that
they're out in the woods.

173
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:45,693
- The motherfuckers.
- They're out in the woods.

174
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,633
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

175
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:57,309
I can't see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

176
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:59,948
Fucking jungle.

177
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:08,282
- They stole a fortune at that motel.
- I know.

178
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:13,289
What if we took the money?

179
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:17,961
Are you crazy?
I'm not getting mixed up in that.

180
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:20,728
I want to exterminate these guys.

181
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:25,237
What? Since when is stealing from
niggers and thieves a crime?

182
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:32,242
It won't be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.

183
00:17:57,107 --> 00:18:03,774
- Did you hear those shots?
- Lf I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

184
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,049
Maracana!

185
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,555
Open the door.

186
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:25,563
- What 's the matter?
- The cops are after me.

187
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:35,343
Shaggy!

188
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:39,413
- Shaggy!
- The cops are on my ass!

189
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:42,847
- Hide me!
- Quick, come in.

190
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:55,028
Shit... I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

191
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:59,267
I had a vision, Goose.

192
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:02,733
You been smoking something?

193
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:05,906
- You've had a job, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:08,168
What 's it like?
What do people say?

195
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:10,505
I worked with my father.

196
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:14,275
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

197
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:19,545
You know what, Goose?
I'm getting out, I don't want to die.

198
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:25,160
- This gangster's life isn't for me.
- Wait! The cops are still down there.

199
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:28,024
I don't give a shit.

200
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,862
I'm going back to the church.

201
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,563
<i>He that dwells in the secret</i>
<i>place of the most High...</i>

00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:39,139

203
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:43,608
<i>He is my refuge and my fortress</i>,
<i>in Him will I trust.</i>

204
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:47,044
<i>Fear not the terror by night</i>,
<i>northe arrow that flies by day...</i>

205
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,277
<i>northe pestilence that walks</i>
<i>in darkness</i>, <i>northe destruction...</i>

206
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:55,356
- Stop, motherfucker!
- Don't move!

207
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:59,128
Stop, or I'll shoot!

208
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:05,792
<i>... shall abide underthe shadow</i>
<i>of the Almighty.</i>

209
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:10,769
<i>The hold-up at the motelwent down</i>
<i>as the bloodiest in history.</i>

210
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:13,807
<i>The destinies of the outlaws</i>
<i>then took different paths.</i>

211
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,446
I don't think this guy
was involved in the heist.

212
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,342
See here?

213
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:24,953
- He's a worker, not a hoodlum.
- I'll make him one now.

214
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:32,524
<i>Destiny put Clipper</i>
<i>back into the hands of God.</i>

215
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:38,228
<i>Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.</i>

216
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:43,396
<i>And Goose was</i>
<i>in my father's hands.</i>

217
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:47,098
Why do you do these things?
You think I'm a fool?

218
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,006
From now on,
you'll work with me.

219
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:54,377
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

220
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:56,575
You listen to me.

221
00:20:56,786 --> 00:21:01,155
If I catch you with money that
isn't yours, I'll kill you.

222
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:07,228
That goes for you too. Get changed!
You start work immediately.

223
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:13,198
<i>Having a hood as a brother sucks.</i>
<i>You always end up footing the bill.</i>

224
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:17,669
Don't worry.
Dad's mad at me...

225
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:22,277
but he'll get over it.

226
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:29,476
Give me that, Rocket. It 's not
for you. You have to study.

227
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:33,019
- Getting shot doesn't scare you?
- I'm a hood because I got no brain.

228
00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:37,057
But you're smart.
You should study.

229
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,859
I go to school because
I don't like physical work.

230
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:45,994
Promise me something... That you'll
never touch this gun. Promise?

231
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:48,795
Let 's shake.

232
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:52,866
We'd better hurry.

233
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:57,671
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don't laugh.

234
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,644
You grinned when I got slapped.

235
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:01,749
- Who, me?
- I saw you.

236
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:33,204
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

237
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,010
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

238
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:40,383
- I'm thinking of what to say to you.
- You're thinking, as well?

239
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,922
Don't. It 'll be your downfall.

240
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:47,392
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

241
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:50,031
Are you pulling my leg?

242
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:53,396
You never heard of
love at first sight?

243
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:59,031
- Hoods don't love, they desire.
- You cut down everything I say.

244
00:22:59,242 --> 00:23:02,939
Hoods don't talk,
they smooth-talk.

245
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:06,479
Well, I'll stop wasting
my breath on you.

246
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:10,210
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

247
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:13,712
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

248
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:17,450
It 's not love,
it 's a con game.

249
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:36,177
It 's just that I love you.

250
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:40,808
You just might end up
convincing me...

251
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:07,799
<i>Afterthe hold-up</i>, <i>there were</i>
<i>constant police raids in the ghetto.</i>

252
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:19,315
<i>Every day,someone went to jail</i>,
<i>someone was nailed.</i>

253
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:25,218
<i>But no one had seen anything.</i>
<i>No one knew anything.</i>

254
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:31,999
<i>No one blabbed to the cops about</i>
<i>where the thieves were hiding out.</i>

255
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,304
3 MONTHS LATER

256
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:37,666
Shaggy...

257
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:41,207
Why don't you change your life?

258
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:45,375
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

259
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:48,415
- Good-for-nothing!
- What do you mean?

260
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:51,587
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

261
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:56,658
That 's right, Shaggy...
what do you think I do all day?

262
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:05,728
Take it easy, baby... you know all
I want is to be with you, have kids...

263
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:10,497
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

264
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:14,575
Sure! For me, that 's
nothing but smooth-talk.

265
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:28,753
What? I almost got
rich with that motel job.

266
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:29,947
Are you kidding?

267
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,726
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

268
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:39,066
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

269
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:42,727
Did you see anything?
You don't know shit, so shut up.

270
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:46,067
You weren't there.
I didn't kill anyone.

271
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:49,973
I bet it 's those fucking policemen,
and I'm the one taking the rap.

272
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:53,808
They even nabbed Li'I Dice.
So don't bring it up again!

273
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:58,083
- I don't care who did it.
- It wasn't me.

274
00:25:58,288 --> 00:26:02,554
Let me just say... I don't want my
kid's father to be a hoodlum.

275
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,158
You're all alone, Shaggy.

276
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,260
- All alone?
- That 's right!

277
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:08,259
- Clipper's gone religious.
- Hallelujah!

278
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:10,159
- Goose is working.
- Ass-kisser!

279
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:12,493
- And you?
- I haven't changed. So what?

280
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:17,002
They've deserted me,
that 's all.

281
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:19,367
Then I'm deserting you too.

282
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:22,066
I'm splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

283
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:26,146
Otherwise, I'll go alone.

284
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:42,824
Fish for sale!

285
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:46,001
<i>My brother had promised</i>
<i>to stop messing around.</i>

286
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:52,664
<i>But a hood doesn't stop</i>,
<i>a hood takes a break.</i>

287
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:56,174
<i>Goose began messing around</i>
<i>wlth Shorty's wife.</i>

288
00:26:56,646 --> 00:27:01,083
I have trout. But for special
customers like you...

289
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:04,253
I also have a kisser fish.

290
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:06,786
Hey, that 's a mullet!

291
00:27:09,592 --> 00:27:11,423
Doesn't your husband...

292
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:13,754
go down on you?

293
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:16,455
No.

294
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,996
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

295
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:24,867
For about half an hour.
And from behind? Do you let him?

296
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:30,273
- Good God, no. Doesn't it hurt?
- The first few times.

297
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,211
Then you'll see, it 's fantastic.
But you need a banana.

298
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:35,907
What for?

299
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:39,111
You're missing the good things
in life, girl!

300
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:42,223
You take a banana, warm it up...

301
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:46,156
Put it up your thing, while he
takes you from behind.

302
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:50,560
It 's a real rush!
Ask your husband.

303
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:55,534
I couldn't. You don't know him.
He's liable to beat me.

304
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:59,435
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.

305
00:28:06,983 --> 00:28:09,383
Motherfucking nigger!

306
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:13,953
Slut!

307
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:17,524
Whoring bitch!

308
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:24,495
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

309
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,966
- Take them off, dammit!
- I'm not going naked in the street.

310
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:33,040
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!

311
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:35,073
Give me your shirt.

312
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:40,015
Your shorts! Hurry up!

313
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:46,851
I knew it. It 's always me
who forks up for that bum.

314
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:57,832
The bastard ran off.
That 's his brother.

315
00:28:58,034 --> 00:29:00,229
- That brat there?
- I'll castrate that fucker.

316
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:07,609
Fish! Fish for sale!

317
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:11,273
Hey, kid, come over here.

318
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:15,241
- Where's your brother?
- He's not working today.

319
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:18,181
- Oh yeah? Get in.
- I didn't do anything.

320
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:20,378
- Get in!
- What about my fish?

321
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,718
- Hurry it up, kid!
- I don't want to lose my fish!

322
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:27,885
- Forget your fish.
- Sit your ass down.

323
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:31,897
- My father will kill me.
- That doesn't matter.

324
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:45,441
Let 's go.
There's nothing here.

325
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:49,584
<i>That day,my father swore he never</i>
<i>wanted to see my brother again.</i>

326
00:29:49,785 --> 00:29:51,412
Let 's go, Felipe.

327
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:57,923
<i>And he never did. No one ever</i>
<i>saw him in the ghetto again.</i>

328
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:01,585
<i>The story of the Tender Trio</i>
<i>was coming to an end.</i>

329
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:08,731
Li'I Dice? Shit, man. I thought you
were a goner at the motel.

330
00:30:08,938 --> 00:30:15,605
- You're fucking loaded!
- Don't, Benny. That 's our money.

331
00:30:16,212 --> 00:30:20,046
Fuck you. Cut the crap

332
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:25,077
Benny... Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

333
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:30,016
- I'm leaving the ghetto.
<i>- But Shorty had his hands full...</i>

334
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:46,073
Let 's go see, Stringy.

339
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:12,800
<i>The hoodlums took off.</i>

340
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:17,270
- You wanna die?
- It 's you who's gonna die...

341
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:21,603
if you don't do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.

342
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:25,671
Let 's go, dammit!

343
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:28,611
- There are cops ahead.
- Fuck them, let 's go.

344
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:31,480
- Where to?
- Anywhere, just go.

345
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,059
- What 's the matter?
- Have mercy!

346
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:40,194
- This car's a piece of junk.
- My ass! Start the damn thing!

347
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:42,921
It needs a push.

348
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:46,131
Push, Shaggy!

349
00:31:46,335 --> 00:31:47,825
Push!

350
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:05,486
You?

351
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:08,988
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there...

352
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:12,354
Nab that guy over there!

353
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:38,745
Run, Shaggy!

354
00:32:38,954 --> 00:32:42,355
Stop the car!

355
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:30,171
- This way! He's over here.
- We got that sonofabitch!

356
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:48,112
- The bastard!
- He's a murderer.

357
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:52,317
<i>0n the day Shaggy died</i>
<i>I rememberthe crowds...</i>

358

359
00:33:55,397 --> 00:33:58,662
<i>I'd always wanted to have one.</i>

360
00:34:00,402 --> 00:34:03,303
Let 's go to school.

361
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:14,282
- Well?
- Let 's go to the beach.

362
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:15,814
But we have an exam.

363
00:34:16,018 --> 00:34:19,681
So what?

364
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:22,483
Everyone else is at the beach.

365
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:25,683
Come on, let 's go!

366
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:29,296
She's in a bikini,
but doesn't want to go.

367
00:34:30,032 --> 00:34:34,401
What 's that saying you have?

368
00:34:34,603 --> 00:34:37,766
The sun is for everyone. The beach,
for those who deserve it.

369
00:34:40,342 --> 00:34:42,640
THE SEVENTIES

370
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:44,745
- Over here!
<i>- I bought my first camera...</i>

371
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:49,213
<i>when lwas 16. Like all poor people</i>,
<i>I started at the bottom...</i>

372

<i>wlth the world's cheapest model.</i>

373
00:34:52,721 --> 00:34:56,020
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

374
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:58,284
Any luck getting laid yet?

375
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,587
Zilch.

376
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:07,198
<i>- Angelica. Iwas crazy about her.</i>
- So, Rocket, still clicking away?

377
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:11,599
<i>She was gorgeous and the only</i>
<i>girl in our gangwho screwed.</i>

378
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:13,796
<i>Iwanted to lose</i>
<i>my virginlty wlth her.</i>

379
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:17,568
With her, buddy?
She's got a guy.

380
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:21,009
- So? I'm not jealous.
- Her father's a sergeant.

381
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:25,049
No one's perfect.
Closer together!

382
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:27,516
<i>Iwas the official</i>
<i>photographerof our gang.</i>

383
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:34,585
<i>The gang of groovies. Everyone</i>
<i>paid to have copies of the pictures.</i>

384
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:44,098
Thiago, move back a little.

385
00:35:44,304 --> 00:35:47,102
- Is this okay?
- Perfect.

386
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:57,081
I need a joint.

387
00:35:57,284 --> 00:36:02,051
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It 's far out.

388
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:06,158
You snort, Thiago?
I prefer a good toke.

389
00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:11,493
If you like,
I can get it for you.

390
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:16,328
You can? Then go on,
move your ass!

391
00:36:16,536 --> 00:36:20,302
But the choice stuff is coke.
That 's a real nercotic.

392
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:22,839
Narcotic!

393
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:29,343
- Your mouth is all salty, Thiago.
- Screw you.

394
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,145
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?

395
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:34,843
- You're never in the water.
- My dad's a lifeguard.

396
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:38,991
- I'll bet you a beer I swim better.
- You're on.

397
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:45,595
If you like, I can go get you
a joint at Blacky's.

398
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:01,705
<i>I'd have done anything</i>
<i>to please her...</i>

399
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:05,409
<i>Buy her pot,coke...</i>

400
00:37:09,623 --> 00:37:14,959
<i>I could go to the top dogs to buy</i>
<i>quallty stuff at a good price...</i>

401
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:22,498
<i>because the local boss</i>
<i>was a formerclassmate: Blacky.</i>

402
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:26,700
- Who is it?
- Rocket.

403
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,175
- How are things down there?
- Fine.

404
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,473
- And the kids?
- Fine too.

405
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:37,582
- You want to buy or smoke a joint?
- Buy.

406
00:37:37,784 --> 00:37:42,551
Come in, buddy.

407
00:37:44,124 --> 00:37:48,618
Who is it?

408
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,600
<i>This was Blacky's turf.</i>

409
00:37:55,802 --> 00:37:59,397
<i>But It hadn't always been his.</i>

410
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:04,402
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'I Dice.

411
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:08,877
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?

00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:15,845
THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT
<i>Dona Zelia began selling drugs here...</i>

413
00:38:16,056 --> 00:38:20,049
<i>when her husband died</i>,
<i>in orderto raise her daughters.</i>

414
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,664
<i>She also gave away drugs to boys at</i>
<i>times in return for special favors.</i>

415
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:31,566
<i>Her favorlte was "Big Boy".</i>
<i>0ne day,he grew very big!</i>

416
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:36,835
<i>Zelia's operation was so amateurthat</i>
<i>he had no trouble seizing It from her.</i>

417
00:38:37,744 --> 00:38:42,238
<i>Big Boy used the neighborhood</i>
<i>kids as dealers.</i>

418
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:47,152
- What about my pot?
- Stick it up your ass.

419
00:38:47,354 --> 00:38:50,118
<i>The best dealer...</i>

420
00:38:51,758 --> 00:38:54,591
<i>... was Carrot.</i>

421
00:38:54,795 --> 00:38:57,423
- Can I have a sip?
- Sure.

422
00:38:57,631 --> 00:39:00,259
<i>He earned Big Boy's trust...</i>

423
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:03,459
<i>was promoted,and moved up to</i>
<i>become a manager.</i>

424
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,333
Blacky, 2O for us and
5 for you, okay?

425
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,776
<i>0ne day a buddy of Carrot's</i>
<i>showed up.</i>

426
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:17,917
<i>- His name was Aristotle.</i>
- My wife needs an operation.

427
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:24,455
<i>His family had taken Carrot in</i>
<i>when he was down and out.</i>

428
00:39:24,658 --> 00:39:27,422
<i>He couldn't refuse to help</i>
<i>a brother in need.</i>

429
00:39:27,627 --> 00:39:32,064
Here's the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.

430
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:35,098
- You've bailed me out, brother.
- Friday.

431
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:39,536
He's my buddy, practically
my brother, Big Boy.

432
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:43,732
Give him another week.

433
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:50,474
- Either you kill him, or I'll kill you.
<i>- Carrot had no choice.</i>

434
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:56,680
- I said Friday.
- Don't do it, man.

435
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,485
<i>Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy</i>,
<i>but It wasn't necessary.</i>

436
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:04,920
<i>Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.</i>
<i>He died in jail.</i>

437
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:11,695
<i>Carrot took everything</i>
<i>that belonged to Big Boy...</i>

438
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:15,534
<i>but didn't want the apartment...</i>

439
00:40:15,742 --> 00:40:19,610
<i>the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave It</i>
<i>to his most trusted dealer...</i>

440
00:40:19,813 --> 00:40:22,543
- Here. 15O bags.
<i>- Blacky.</i>

441
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:24,876
Give me more. This place
is crawling with druggies.

442
00:40:25,085 --> 00:40:28,350
<i>That's how he took over</i>
<i>the local trade.</i>

443
00:40:28,555 --> 00:40:30,819
<i>But not for long...</i>

444
00:40:32,025 --> 00:40:34,289

- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?

00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,447
Yeah, who?

- Something wrong, Li'I Dice?
- Li'I Dice, my ass.

450

455
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,550
I want to get out of here.

456
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:40,383
What, kid? Your friend took
everything. What do you want?

457
00:41:46,566 --> 00:41:49,831
<i>That night,Li'I Dice</i>
<i>satisfied his thirst to kill...</i>

458
00:41:50,036 --> 00:41:52,561

460
00:42:05,452 --> 00:42:08,182
<i>He had to work hard for peanuts.</i>

<i>They had the gift of crime.</i>

463
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:23,231
- You have more money than me.
- It was my idea.

464
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:26,599
<i>The only problem was running into</i>
<i>an older hoodlum...</i>

465

<i>... like my brother,Goose.</i>
- Li'I Dice?

Gold chain, gold watch...

494
00:44:42,642 --> 00:44:45,805
Look at Carrot, and his car.

495
00:44:46,012 --> 00:44:49,743
- They're all dealers.
- They're all fucking loaded.

496
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:51,974
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

497
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:54,983
- The big bucks are in drugs.
- I see.

498
00:44:55,188 --> 00:44:57,179
Especially in selling coke.

499
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,654
- But you need money.
- Not really...

500
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:03,556
We'll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

501
00:45:03,763 --> 00:45:06,527
- When do we start?
- Now.

502
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:20,001
Exu-the-Devil is the light
that shines forth.

503
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:22,807
He brought you here.

504
00:45:23,016 --> 00:45:28,215
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

505
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:33,491
I know what you want.
You want power.

506
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:37,823
I have something which will
give it to you.

507
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:43,859
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

508
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,665
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet...

509
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:50,342
otherwise...

510
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:53,811
you'll die.

511
00:45:54,314 --> 00:45:56,714
The boy is no longer called
Li'I Dice...

512
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:58,907
but Li'I Z'.

513
00:45:59,118 --> 00:46:02,679
Li'I Z' will grow up.

514
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:06,789
You stick with me,
I'll stick with you.

515
00:46:18,071 --> 00:46:21,529
<i>Li'I Dice became Li'I Z'</i>
<i>and he began to kill.</i>

516
00:46:22,575 --> 00:46:29,242
<i>He started one morning</i>,
<i>taking overJerry Adriani's racket.</i>

517
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:34,819
<i>By that night,almost all</i>
<i>of the rackets in the ghetto were his.</i>

518
00:46:35,021 --> 00:46:38,422
<i>The only business he didn't</i>
<i>touch was Carrot's...</i>

519
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:42,584
<i>since he was a friend of Benny's.</i>
<i>All that was left was the apartment...</i>

520
00:46:42,795 --> 00:46:43,853
<i>But that would be easy.</i>

521
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:51,695
Who is it?

522
00:46:58,444 --> 00:47:00,309
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'I Dice.

523
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:06,645
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?

524
00:47:06,853 --> 00:47:08,480
- Something wrong, Li'I Dice?
- Li'I Dice, my ass.

525
00:47:08,688 --> 00:47:12,146
- My name is Li'I Z' now.
- His name's Li'I Z', see?

526
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:15,486
- You're a goner, bastard.
- Don't kill him. He understands.

527
00:47:15,695 --> 00:47:17,822
Right, Blacky?

528
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:22,559
It 's all yours, I don't want anything.
I don't want no trouble, okay?

529
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:25,897
<i>I should have taken this chance</i>
<i>to avenge my brother's death.</i>

530
00:47:27,774 --> 00:47:32,473
You'll live, but you'll
work for us. Understand?

531
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:34,772
<i>That's easy to say...</i>

532
00:47:36,115 --> 00:47:39,312
- Where are you going?
- He's clean, Li'I Z'.

533
00:47:39,886 --> 00:47:41,319
What 's your name, kid?

534
00:47:41,521 --> 00:47:45,321
- Rocket.
- He's Goose's brother.

535
00:47:45,525 --> 00:47:48,119
- Goose?
- The late Goose.

536
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:51,593
Quick, kid. Run along.

537
00:47:51,798 --> 00:47:56,258
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li'I Z'.

538
00:47:56,469 --> 00:48:00,371
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?

539
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,469
Cocaine.

540
00:48:05,478 --> 00:48:08,413
- Where's the turf?
- Over there, on the left.

541
00:48:08,614 --> 00:48:11,640
<i>Selling drugs is like any</i>
<i>other business.</i>

542
00:48:11,985 --> 00:48:13,885
<i>The supplier</i>
<i>delivers the merchandise...</i>

543
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:16,817
<i>which is then</i>
<i>packaged on the premises.</i>

544
00:48:17,156 --> 00:48:20,956
<i>It's done in an assembly line.</i>

545
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,219
<i>Boring as hell...</i>

546
00:48:23,696 --> 00:48:27,723
<i>Pot is wrapped up in "lids".</i>

547
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:30,697
<i>Cocaine is put into packets...</i>

548
00:48:31,437 --> 00:48:35,669
<i>and then into bundles</i>
<i>of 10 or 100.</i>

549
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:38,909
<i>You can even make a career</i>
<i>in dealing drugs.</i>

550
00:48:39,112 --> 00:48:42,946
<i>The kids start out</i>
<i>as delivery boys.</i>

551
00:48:43,216 --> 00:48:47,209
<i>They're paid to run errands</i>
<i>and take messages.</i>

552
00:48:47,954 --> 00:48:50,946
<i>Then they become lookouts.</i>
<i>If the police arrive...</i>

553
00:48:51,157 --> 00:48:53,990
<i>the kltes disappear</i>
<i>and everyone scrams.</i>

554
00:48:55,261 --> 00:48:58,856
<i>Later,you become a dealer</i>
<i>or a "vapor".</i>

555
00:48:59,065 --> 00:49:02,159
<i>When the heat's on</i>, <i>the</i>
<i>"vapor"quickly evaporates.</i>

556
00:49:02,368 --> 00:49:06,498
<i>Moving up the ladder</i>,
<i>you have the "soldier".</i>

557
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:10,334
<i>And if the guy is good at math</i>,
<i>he can become a manager...</i>

558
00:49:10,543 --> 00:49:14,001
<i>the boss' right-hand man.</i>

559
00:49:15,448 --> 00:49:19,384
<i>The police receive their part</i>
<i>and don't make trouble.</i>

560
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:24,181
<i>Since Li'I Z' killed off</i>
<i>all of his enemies...</i>

561
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:29,350
<i>there were no shoot-outs in the</i>
<i>Clty of God. You could drive there...</i>

562
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:33,256
<i>The playboys felt safe</i>
<i>buying their drugs there.</i>

563
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,364
<i>The Clty teemed wlth addicts</i>
<i>and Li'I Z' grew rich.</i>

564
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:42,604
- Is it okay?
- It 's a deal.

565
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:50,306
- I can't decide which to wear.
- This one's cool.

566
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:55,519
<i>If dealingwere legal,Li'I Z'</i>
<i>would have been man of the year.</i>

567
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:01,726
<i>But things were risky for me.</i>
<i>Iwas afraid of him.</i>

568
00:50:01,928 --> 00:50:06,126
<i>- And he was everywhere.</i>
- What a drag this guy is.

569
00:50:06,332 --> 00:50:11,463
<i>Whenever lwanted to smoke a joint</i>
<i>I had to go see Carrot.</i>

570
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:18,976
Half a lid. Thanks.

571
00:50:20,113 --> 00:50:24,277
<i>But It was worth It.</i>
<i>I only smoked wlth Angelica.</i>

572
00:50:25,952 --> 00:50:28,819
<i>She and Thiago had spllt up</i>,
<i>so I made my move.</i>

573
00:50:29,021 --> 00:50:34,823
<i>- Iwas about to win herover...</i>
- These pictures are really great.

574
00:50:35,027 --> 00:50:38,622
- You think so?
- I look good here.

575
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:41,595
- You look beautiful everywhere.
- I'm serious.

576
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:42,790
Me too.

577
00:50:45,705 --> 00:50:50,938
<i>A setting sun</i>,
<i>a deserted beach... a long kiss...</i>

578
00:50:51,144 --> 00:50:53,977
<i>Iwas sure this was It...</i>

579
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,171
<i>But the Runts arrived.</i>

580
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:01,015
Can I have a toke?

581
00:51:06,592 --> 00:51:07,786
Here.

582
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:12,192
I'm going. See you later.

583
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:17,365
Hold on, Angelica.

584
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,061
- Your joint, man.
- Keep it.

585
00:51:20,273 --> 00:51:22,605
What a cool guy.

586
00:51:25,578 --> 00:51:29,947
<i>That was my first run</i>
<i>in wlth the Runts.</i>

587
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,880
- Steak and fries, Benny.
- Great! Here...

588
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:48,333
- A tip for you.
- Really? Thanks.

589
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,831
- Wanna eat something?
- No.

590
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:58,237
- Wanna trade this watch?
<i>- After Angelica left him...</i>

591
00:51:58,443 --> 00:52:00,343
<i>Thiago began snorting</i>
<i>more and more.</i>

592
00:52:00,545 --> 00:52:03,639
- Is it your grandfather's?
- No, my dad's.

593
00:52:03,848 --> 00:52:08,148
<i>When a guy is really hooked</i>
<i>he ends up in the hands of the dealer.</i>

594
00:52:08,353 --> 00:52:10,480
- Two bags of ten.
- One of ten.

595
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:14,785
- Okay, one bag.
<i>- For Thiago,It was different.</i>

596
00:52:14,993 --> 00:52:18,485
- Watch out!
- Sorry, godfather.

597
00:52:18,863 --> 00:52:21,661
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?

598
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:24,892
- I'm sorry.
- Now beat it.

599
00:52:27,505 --> 00:52:31,498
Blacky, lend me your bike.

600
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:57,230
Hey, wanna race?

601
00:52:57,435 --> 00:53:00,893
- Where to?
- Up to the highway.

602
00:53:01,506 --> 00:53:04,441
- Okay.
- Ready? Go!

603
00:53:26,831 --> 00:53:30,665
- Pretty tough, wasn't it?
- Yeah, you're good.

604
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:33,201
Where'd you buy those sneakers?

605
00:53:33,404 --> 00:53:35,998
- Not far from here.
- The shirt, as well?

606
00:53:36,207 --> 00:53:38,539
- No, uptown.
- Cool.

607
00:53:38,743 --> 00:53:40,973
It 's a designer shirt.

608
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:43,511
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

609
00:53:43,715 --> 00:53:46,377
Shorts and a shirt?

610
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,918
Buy whatever you can.

611
00:53:53,591 --> 00:53:55,650
- What size are you?
- Measure me.

612
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,795
- With what, man?
- Shit, with your hand.

613
00:54:00,298 --> 00:54:03,028
Shoe size? Turn around.

614
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:16,770
- Hey, Benny!
- You got the digs?

615
00:54:19,784 --> 00:54:23,049
- Just one pair of pants?
- No, there's more.

616
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:29,455
- You like it?
- Yeah.

617
00:54:30,728 --> 00:54:33,060
There's some change.

618
00:54:33,631 --> 00:54:36,566
- Keep it.
- Cool.

619
00:54:45,076 --> 00:54:47,670
This is Benny.

620
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,375
- This is Rocket.
- Hi. I know him.

621
00:55:16,841 --> 00:55:19,503
I've become a playboy.

622
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:25,576
Hey, gangsters, listen to this...

623
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:27,614
Watch out...

624
00:55:27,819 --> 00:55:31,482
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

625
00:55:34,959 --> 00:55:36,688
Oh, yeah?

626
00:55:37,562 --> 00:55:40,258
Fuck off, you bastards!

627
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,400
Making fun of me?

628
00:55:47,672 --> 00:55:49,867
Asshole!

629
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:08,987
Benny, didn't I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He's endangering the ghetto.

630
00:56:09,193 --> 00:56:12,720
- Cool it. Go talk to him.
- I'm gonna kill that fucker.

631
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:15,798
- Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
- I'm gonna kill him.

632
00:56:18,136 --> 00:56:21,128
Don't worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

633
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:23,933
Sure, I'm not worried.

634
00:56:24,409 --> 00:56:28,243
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

635
00:56:28,446 --> 00:56:32,507
Go on, buddy. Go talk to the guy.

636
00:56:32,717 --> 00:56:36,278
<i>Benny was the coolest hood</i>
<i>in the Clty of God.</i>

637
00:56:36,487 --> 00:56:39,650
<i>He gave away pot</i>,
<i>paid for drinks.</i>

638
00:56:40,158 --> 00:56:43,252
<i>Li'I Z' was the opposlte.</i>
<i>He had one obsession:</i>

639
00:56:43,461 --> 00:56:45,429
<i>To be the boss of the ghetto.</i>

640
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:48,895
<i>He wanted an excuse to take over</i>
<i>Carrot's racket.</i>

641
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,727
- Hey, Carrot.
- What 's up?

642
00:56:50,935 --> 00:56:55,235
You shouldn't let the Runts
do hold-ups in the ghetto.

643
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,605
You look after your section,
I'll look after mine.

644
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:02,678
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

645
00:57:10,555 --> 00:57:15,458
- Hey, Rocket! How's it going?
- Great.

646
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,720
- Hey, Benny!
- How's it going?

647
00:57:19,497 --> 00:57:22,466
- Hey, Thiago. How are you?
- Good.

648
00:57:23,534 --> 00:57:25,001
- May I?
- Sure...

649
00:57:25,203 --> 00:57:27,501
Wanna dance?

650
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:34,467
- Is it okay at your place?
- No problem.

651
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:38,342
My parents are out.
You'll be all alone with her.

652
00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:42,952
- You can lose your virginity tonight.
- Not so loud, man!

653
00:57:43,154 --> 00:57:44,883
Everyone will hear.

654
00:57:46,124 --> 00:57:48,524
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

655
00:57:48,726 --> 00:57:53,186
- Shit!
- Nothing's happening.

656
00:58:00,405 --> 00:58:04,705
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

657
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:08,572
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?
You want to take my racket?

658
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,978
I want to talk to you
because you're fucking useless.

659
00:58:13,184 --> 00:58:14,173
Get your hand away!

660
00:58:14,385 --> 00:58:17,411
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

661
00:58:17,622 --> 00:58:18,953
Give the baby his bottle.

662
00:58:19,157 --> 00:58:21,557
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?

663
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:25,160
Carrot 's useless. He lets the Runts
do hold-ups in his section.

664
00:58:25,363 --> 00:58:28,298
The police come around and
that 's bad for business.

665
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:32,161
I'll do it only because
I like you.

666
00:58:32,503 --> 00:58:34,164
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.

667
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:38,206
I'll show you who's the baby...

668
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:43,904
Tell the kids that in my ghetto
no one robs or rapes!

669
00:58:44,115 --> 00:58:45,582
No wonder you're "Little" Z'!

670
00:58:48,753 --> 00:58:53,690
<i>The Runts were kids who didn't</i>
<i>respect the laws of the ghetto.</i>

671
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:57,349
<i>They would mug residents</i>,
<i>hold up bakeries...</i>

672
00:58:57,562 --> 00:58:59,757
<i>especially in Carrot's section.</i>

673
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,261
What are you doing?

674
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:12,533
- You rob me all the time!
<i>- But they didn't know...</i>

675
00:59:12,743 --> 00:59:15,075
<i>that the Clty had a boss now.</i>

676
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:18,973
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

677
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:23,017
<i>The Clty had become</i>
<i>much safer for residents.</i>

678
00:59:24,355 --> 00:59:27,222
<i>There were hardly</i>
<i>any hold-ups now.</i>

679
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,755
<i>You just had to go see Li'I Z'.</i>

680
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,088
- Let 's go.
- Don't hurt the Runts.

681
00:59:32,296 --> 00:59:35,197
I won't touch them.

682
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,838
- Hi, Steak.
- How's it going, Li'I Z'?

683
00:59:41,038 --> 00:59:43,734
- Wanna take a walk, Steak?
- With you? Hold on...

684
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:49,169
Mom, I'm going out with
my friends.

685
01:00:01,626 --> 01:00:04,288
That 's the best chicken
I ever ate.

686
01:00:04,762 --> 01:00:08,823
- The old guy was scared shitless.
- Feeling sorry for him?

687
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:12,059
You're crazy, man!

688
01:00:20,478 --> 01:00:23,345
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

689
01:00:23,548 --> 01:00:27,985
- Peanuts. Drugs are where it 's at.
- Yeah, selling drugs.

690
01:00:28,186 --> 01:00:34,489
But you have to start out as a delivery
boy. You wanna be a delivery boy?

691
01:00:34,692 --> 01:00:39,925
It 's a rip off.
It takes a long time to move up.

692
01:00:40,231 --> 01:00:44,565
You have to wait till an older guy
gets killed to move up.

693
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:47,965
I don't wanna wait till some guy
croaks. I'm gonna do what Li'I Z' did.

694
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:50,868
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

695
01:00:51,075 --> 01:00:53,908
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

696
01:00:58,015 --> 01:00:59,573
Come back, you brat!

697
01:01:03,955 --> 01:01:10,622
- They're quick, those kids.
- They run fast.

698
01:01:11,862 --> 01:01:14,763
They're all gone except you.
Any others?

699
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,002
You're gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

700
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:29,373
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

701
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:31,881
Come on, choose!

702
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,847
Hand or foot?

703
01:01:37,388 --> 01:01:40,118
Choose, for fuck's sake!

704
01:01:47,865 --> 01:01:50,993
- Hand.
- The little hand, eh?

705
01:01:59,877 --> 01:02:01,970
Cool.

706
01:02:03,247 --> 01:02:07,650
Hey, Steak'n'fries,
let 's see what you're made of.

707
01:02:07,852 --> 01:02:11,185
Choose and then kill
one of them.

708
01:02:11,389 --> 01:02:15,189
- Leave it. I'll do it.
- Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.
