1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,157
THE SAMURAI

2
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,996
There is no greater solitude
than the samurai's,

3
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:36,991
unless perhaps it be
that of the tiger in the jungle.

4
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:39,952
The Book of Bushido

5
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:16,158
Saturday, 4th April. 6 p.m.

6
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,514
Jef?

7
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,669
This evening I came round
at 7.1 5 and stayed till 2 a.m.

8
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,075
Can't be done. Wiener called.

9
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,270
He said he'd be back at two.

10
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,758
All right, until 1 .45, then.

11
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,712
I like it when you come round
because you need me.

12
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,629
It is your say.

13
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,990
How long will you be here?

14
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,156
We have the room all night.

15
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,274
Count me in from 2 o'clock.

16
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,710
Bring money, in case you lose.

17
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,158
I never lose.

18
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,879
Never completely.

19
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,154
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter.

20
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,589
What do you want?

21
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,509
To kill you.

22
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,318
General alert!

23
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,194
Carry out the usual round-ups
and identity checks all night.

24
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,439
The killer is believed to be tall,
wearing hat and raincoat.

25
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,676
I want at least 20 likely suspects
from each precinct.

26
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,316
So what if it makes 400?
The population's 1 0 million.

27
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,192
Hurry it up, or it'll be too late.

28
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,357
Police! Open up!

29
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,757
Identities check.
Your papers, gentlemen.

30
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,028
- How long have you been here?
- Since 7 o'clock.

31
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,913
What about you?

32
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,474
9 or 9.1 5.

33
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,153
- How do you earn your living?
- Full disability pension, war wounds.

34
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,278
When did you get here?

35
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,117
2 or 2.1 5.

36
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,878
Come along with us. Routine check.

37
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,913
If you can show legal means
of support, you'll be released.

38
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,793
Quiet please!

39
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,632
Damolini, Ange Seraphin, 41 .

40
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:54,752
Picked up in a bar,
corner of rue Saint-Dominique.

41
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,554
Carrying a gun.

42
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,188
Take off the glasses.

43
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,152
What have you to say?

44
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,430
Not a thing.

45
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:10,627
What were you doing
with a gun in your pocket?

46
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,914
Next.

47
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,068
Over here!

48
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,199
Garcia, Juan, 4 7,

49
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,913
and Delbarre, Jeanne, 51 .

50
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,155
Picked up in the street.

51
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,554
The man armed.

52
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,238
Take off your hat.

53
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,191
You aren't married, are you?

54
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,154
Living together?

55
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,950
Why the gun?

56
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,709
The streets aren't safe at night
in Paris.

57
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,593
I might have to defend myself.

58
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,631
Consider your record.

59
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,313
1 945: sentenced to 6 months
for incitement of minors to vice.

60
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,432
1 950: 1 2 months for drug trafficking.

61
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,430
1 952: attempted burglary.
1 955: sentenced for immoral earnings.

62
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,995
1 958: attempted murder.

63
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,672
1 960: manslaughter charge,
insufficient evidence.

64
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,189
Well?

65
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,788
Next.

66
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,517
Costello, Jef, 30.

67
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,951
No criminal record,
matches description given.

68
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,390
Not carrying a gun.

69
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,672
He wore a hat.

70
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,272
Put your hat on.

71
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:14,797
It wasn't a hat like that.

72
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,318
It was darker.

73
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,271
No, it was a light colour.

74
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,918
But he had a moustache, I think.

75
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,709
Why did you shave, Costello?

76
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,996
I've never worn a moustache.

77
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,638
I don't think it was him.

78
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,708
No, definitely not.

79
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,275
Sorry, but I think it is.

80
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,199
I remember exactly how the man looked.

81
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,549
Yes, indeed, it could be him.

82
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,236
Where were you from 1 2 to 2?

83
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,433
At my fiancee's.

84
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,313
Name, address and phone number.

85
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,833
Is that necessary?

86
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,599
Unless you want to be held.

87
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,910
Jane Lagrange,
1 1 avenue de I'Amiral Bruix.

88
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,716
Telephone?

89
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,914
Mac-Mahon 91 -73.

90
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,310
Mademoiselle Lagrange, please.

91
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,556
Just Mademoiselle Lagrange.

92
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,952
Aside from the gentleman
who escorted you here,

93
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,832
any other visitor last night?

94
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,836
Your private life is not our concern.

95
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,951
Entertain whom you wish.

96
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,232
That is your right.

97
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,349
I simply want to know whether,
before Monsieur Wiener arrived at two,

98
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,508
you had another visitor?

99
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,198
Until when? And who?

100
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:33,115
Until 1 .45. A man.

101
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,678
I imagined so.
The same age as Monsieur Wiener?

102
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,518
No, younger.

103
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,516
Somewhere around thirty?

104
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,751
Yes, around thirty.

105
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,275
The time?

106
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,990
From 7 or 7.1 5 until 1 .45.

107
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,073
Sure it was 1 .45?

108
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,156
I made him leave then.
I was expecting Monsieur Wiener at 2.

109
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,672
I understand.

110
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,274
Now, just for verification.

111
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,672
The name of this 30-year old?

112
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,798
Do I have to say?

113
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,038
Jef Costello.

114
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,913
Will you wait a moment, please?

115
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,393
He didn't mention
that he knew the victim well?

116
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,793
- Why didn't you tell him?
- Because it's not true.

117
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,637
You'll have to prove that.

118
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:52,115
I believe you'll have to prove
the contrary.

119
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,674
What you won't be able to deny,
or not for long anyway,

120
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,712
is your regular attendance
at that establishment.

121
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,030
I've never set foot in the place.

122
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,834
What is it you want?

123
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,316
Costello's confession
to a crime he didn't commit?

124
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,589
Optimistic, aren't you?

125
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,876
I'll make you change your tune
in a moment.

126
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,795
Bring Wiener straight in here.

127
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,958
Monsieur Wiener, at 2 or 2.1 5,
you visited Mademoiselle Lagrange?

128
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,433
That is correct.

129
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,314
Think carefully before you answer this.

130
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,678
Did you get the feeling,
when you arrived,

131
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,075
that someone had just left?

132
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,835
Forgive the frankness, but...

133
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,353
Did you feel
that your place was still warm?

134
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,914
- I beg your pardon?
- Please answer.

135
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,510
I'm not very observant.

136
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,349
More's the pity.

137
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,268
I do remember something though.

138
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:20,919
When I entered the apartment block,

139
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,998
someone had pressed the light button.

140
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,471
I noticed a man going past me,
on his way out.

141
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,797
Now that I think of it,

142
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,672
he wasn't far from her door

143
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,950
and could well have just left.

144
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,117
Would you recognise the man?

145
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,834
I don't think so.

146
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,395
Let's try, shall we?

147
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,755
Hats and coats on, gentlemen.

148
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,915
Form up in 3 ranks.

149
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,668
You come with me.

150
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,709
Stand over there.

151
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,191
Change coats with him.

152
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,838
And you, your hat.

153
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,634
Please come with me.

154
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,669
Do you recognise the man you passed

155
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,154
in the hallway of Mademoiselle Lagrange?

156
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,832
Do you recognise anyone?

157
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,028
I have a composite image
of the man I passed.

158
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,751
That raincoat.

159
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,832
That hat.

160
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,277
Or that one.

161
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,478
That face.

162
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,516
What would the result have been
if you were observant?

163
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,557
Will you come with me, please?

164
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,393
That's it.

165
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,672
I'm sorry. The nature of our work

166
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,950
is sometimes inconsistent with courtesy.

167
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,309
May I go if you've finished with me?

168
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,193
Certainly.

169
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,434
So my private life
''is not our concern''?

170
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,400
I'm investigating a crime.

171
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,672
I can't be choosy about my methods.

172
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,949
Time's precious.

173
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,351
May I go too?

174
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,388
Of course.

175
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,711
Show Mademoiselle out.

176
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:57,393
I'm going to show you Costello
once more.

177
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,950
Try to be categorical.

178
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:03,192
No maybes or perhapses.

179
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,870
Either: ''Yes, it's him''
or ''No, it's not''.

180
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,834
Show him in.

181
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:24,317
Do you recognise this man?

182
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,118
Did you see him
leave the door to the offices?

183
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,115
Definitely not.

184
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:34,674
Thank you. Please wait in my office.

185
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,033
Do you still say
that this was the man you saw?

186
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,674
I can answer that categorically.

187
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,471
I'm asking you to.

188
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,392
Yes, it was him.

189
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,598
Please wait in my office.

190
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,718
Do you recognise this man?

191
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,354
Frankly, I don't think so.

192
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,107
Same question.

193
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,310
I'm not sure. I'd need to see

194
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,714
the other one again.

195
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:34,035
I don't know. I'm not sure.

196
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,149
I can't answer categorically.

197
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,553
Mademoiselle, only you got a good look
at the man who killed Martey.

198
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,716
I can either hold him
and try to break his alibi,

199
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:59,433
as one witness
has formally identified him.

200
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:03,631
Or he'll be set free,
depending on your answer.

201
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:07,037
And that'll be the end of it.

202
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,236
I'm in no doubt whatsoever.

203
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:11,395
He was definitely not the man.

204
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,392
Thank you.

205
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,551
Not at all.

206
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,312
That's all, gentlemen.

207
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:46,868
Sunday, 5.45 a.m.

208
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:00,508
May I go?

209
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:02,993
Unfortunately.

210
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:20,234
- How many suspects left?
- 9.

211
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,836
Same routine for them all.

212
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,435
A nice way to spend Sunday.

213
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,631
What do you think about Costello?

214
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,118
I never think.

215
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,993
1 rue Lord Byron.

216
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:32,674
1 rue Lord Byron. He's inside.

217
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:36,236
I'll drive round the block,
then back here

218
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:39,078
to see if he comes out.

219
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:42,317
Watch it. There's another entrance

220
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,272
on the Champs Elysees: 1 1 6B.

221
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:46,229
I'm coming to it.

222
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:47,667
Stay there and report.

223
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:49,551
I can park.

224
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,437
He's taking the metro.

225
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,709
Follow him. Or try anyway.

226
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:11,390
He got away. What do I do?

227
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,067
The usual. Come back here.

228
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,955
It's done.

229
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,151
I know. You were arrested, though?

230
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,348
No problem.

231
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,198
Fine. A deal's a deal.

232
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,033
We can't leave him
on the lose like that.

233
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:57,192
Homicide picked him up
and had him in custody.

234
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,718
That he's been freed proves nothing.

235
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,551
He may still be a suspect.

236
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,158
I don't think so.

237
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,587
He set himself up a terrific alibi.

238
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,915
Suppose they break it?

239
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,078
No way. It comes in two parts,

240
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:15,917
each one entirely separate.

241
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,475
I can imagine. He's really good,

242
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,240
that's why we used him.

243
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:24,875
He fulfilled the contract:
to kill Martey

244
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,354
without leaving any trail.

245
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,999
He's a Ione wolf.

246
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:33,477
He's a wounded wolf,
now there will be a trail.

247
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,477
He must be disposed of quickly.

248
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,274
The police won't find a culprit,

249
00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:42,354
so they'll stay on his trail.

250
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:48,712
Despite that alibi of his,
he's still their number one suspect.

251
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,192
We'll be on his trail, too.

252
00:47:56,439 --> 00:47:59,875
Don't let him slip through
your fingers again.

253
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:01,908
No proof,

254
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,395
yet something stinks.

255
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,509
What?

256
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,189
I don't know.

257
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,198
He's different.

258
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:15,471
The other suspects I can hold
for 48 hours, but not him.

259
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,513
- His alibi holds up.
- Too well.

260
00:48:19,919 --> 00:48:21,955
Wiener's telling the truth.

261
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:24,557
But I'm sure the girl's lying.

262
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,750
We have to find a way to break her,
so she'll talk.

263
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,437
If we can get her on a perjury charge
or whatever,

264
00:48:34,759 --> 00:48:39,515
we'll have our Jef Costello,
sitting right here.

265
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,154
If you're right, he'll just laugh.

266
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,508
I don't think so.

267
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,392
Have you seen many guys

268
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,912
with nothing to say
after two days in handcuffs?

269
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,433
I haven't.

270
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:57,432
Keep after the girl but don't lose him.

271
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,714
Sunday, 1 0 p.m.

272
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,317
One could say, if you were the guy
the police want,

273
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,317
the killer always returns
to the scene of the crime.

274
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:36,033
May I get in?

275
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,073
Why say you didn't recognise me?

276
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,468
Why kill Martey?

277
01:01:08,439 --> 01:01:10,192
I was to be paid.

278
01:01:11,479 --> 01:01:13,310
What had he done to you?

279
01:01:13,759 --> 01:01:15,477
Not a thing.

280
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,272
I didn't know him.

281
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,236
I met him for the first and last time
24 hours ago.

282
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,430
What sort of man are you?

283
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:38,439
You knew Martey and unfortunately,
you have no alibi.

284
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,517
I was driving in from Fontainebleau.

285
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,517
With no witnesses to prove it.

286
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:57,194
- Anything?
- No, the stoolies seem to be on strike.

287
01:01:57,399 --> 01:01:58,515
God forbid!

288
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,357
- Here's something.
- What?

289
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,198
Costello dumped it, leaving his place.

290
01:02:03,399 --> 01:02:04,037
What's in it?

291
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,312
Bloody gauze and cotton wool.
He's hurt.

292
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,828
- Interesting. You know where he is?
- Of course.

293
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,589
I haven't much time to find out
who wanted Martey dead.

294
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:15,028
What do you care?

295
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,988
I got paid off with a bullet.

296
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:25,189
I don't want them to try again,
so I have to find them first.

297
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,754
The blond guy I met on the footbridge

298
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,435
didn't give me much time to think.

299
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,392
I need to find him and his boss.

300
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:41,109
They hired you, didn't they?

301
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,350
Through an intermediary.

302
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,915
The reason you didn't identify me
could be...

303
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,596
that you like playing games
with the police,

304
01:02:58,959 --> 01:03:02,508
or that you weren't supposed
to recognise me.

305
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:09,276
Under arrest,
I became an indirect threat

306
01:03:09,479 --> 01:03:11,788
to whoever ordered the killing.

307
01:03:13,479 --> 01:03:14,674
So?

308
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,919
Perhaps you know where he is.

309
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,437
6.1 0... Call me in 2 hours.

310
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:41,473
Monday, 7 a.m.

311
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,158
Dreadful, aren't they?

312
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,147
It's hard to stop them
from overdoing things.

313
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:37,033
Promotion is very important
to a policeman.

314
01:04:38,479 --> 01:04:41,073
I was the same when I was younger.

315
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,517
- Whereas now you're more fatalistic?
- Exactly.

316
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,075
You like things to run smoothly.

317
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:49,634
I don't like forcing the pace

318
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:52,678
to extract confessions
or get information.

319
01:04:53,919 --> 01:04:55,638
I'm very liberal,

320
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,392
a great believer
in the liberty of the individual,

321
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,714
in people's right to live
as they choose.

322
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:09,354
Provided that the way of life
they choose harms no one else

323
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:11,596
and is contrary

324
01:05:11,799 --> 01:05:16,475
to neither law nor public decency.

325
01:05:17,439 --> 01:05:20,955
- Don't you agree?
- What are you telling me?

326
01:05:21,799 --> 01:05:24,518
This: on the night Martey was killed,

327
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,553
according to your sworn testimony,

328
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:31,839
Jef Costello was with you at your place
from 7 p.m. to 1 .45 a.m.

329
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,395
- Is that correct?
- Yes it is.

330
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:41,596
Suppose that I discover that Costello
wasn't with you during those 6 hours.

331
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,191
You'll be laying yourself open to
charges of perjury, contempt of court,

332
01:05:47,399 --> 01:05:52,314
obstruction of justice
and accessory to murder.

333
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,511
That will mean five years, minimum.

334
01:05:57,279 --> 01:05:58,837
Five years is a long time,

335
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:01,674
especially for a girl of your age.

336
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,071
I'm telling you this

337
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,390
because I have a daughter

338
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:11,198
just your age,

339
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,991
and I would find it distressing.

340
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,908
Really?

341
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,596
You're wrong not to believe me.

342
01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:22,390
You seem to be a fine young woman.

343
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,879
Very much so, in fact.

344
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,312
Your attitude has shown one thing
at least:

345
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,999
you have courage.

346
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,392
I don't know many who'd do as much

347
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,477
for a boyfriend, sorry...

348
01:06:37,399 --> 01:06:38,752
For a fiance.

349
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:45,187
Your behaviour has been immaculate,
but I can't say the same for his.

350
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,189
- Have you seen him since?
- No.

351
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,439
I thought not...

352
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,718
The rotten little jerk.

353
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,674
Do you know where he is right now?

354
01:06:57,879 --> 01:06:59,279
Would you like to know?

355
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:04,031
I'll tell you anyway.

356
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:08,040
He's with that nightclub pianist.

357
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,075
They've suddenly become inseparable.

358
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,397
A very passionate thing, it seems.

359
01:07:18,879 --> 01:07:20,631
You don't seem to mind.

360
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:24,397
Don't you love him?

361
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:28,875
Really?

362
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,118
I'd have said you did.

363
01:07:32,279 --> 01:07:35,238
Laying yourself on the line
for him like that,

364
01:07:35,439 --> 01:07:37,395
I thought you must love him.

365
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,991
You're not the psychologist
you imagined.

366
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,758
I suppose not.

367
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:45,712
I saw him as your...

368
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,633
How do they put it?
Your fancy man.

369
01:07:49,439 --> 01:07:51,475
And the respectable gentleman,

370
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,353
Wiener,

371
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,229
as the one who pays the bills.

372
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:03,358
Girls like you are close
to being prostitutes.

373
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:06,237
Have you ever thought about it?

374
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,234
You should.

375
01:08:10,439 --> 01:08:12,510
Your life could be made very unpleasant,

376
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:16,028
if the Vice Squad chose to.

377
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,550
They don't play games.

378
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,917
You need to be covered...
No pun intended.

379
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,398
You'd cover for me?

380
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:29,715
Better than that.

381
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,032
I'd like to help you out of this spot.

382
01:08:35,559 --> 01:08:37,197
This is your statement.

383
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,755
Tell me, without witnesses,

384
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,719
that Costello wasn't here that night,

385
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,389
and I'll tear it up.

386
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:49,835
No more problems about perjury.

387
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,674
And you won't have
to make another statement.

388
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,599
What about the Vice Squad?

389
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,438
You have my word. They'll keep away.

390
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,108
I knew you were a bright girl.

391
01:09:03,559 --> 01:09:06,631
If I understand you right,
if I perjure myself,

392
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,035
I'll have no problems.

393
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,111
If I insist on telling the truth,

394
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:16,517
then I can expect trouble.
Am I right?

395
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,278
Not quite.

396
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,634
Because the truth isn't what you say.

397
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,353
It's what I say,

398
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,996
despite the methods I am obliged
to employ to get at it.

399
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,274
So?

400
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,234
Is it yes?

401
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,875
It's no.

402
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,955
As you wish.

403
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,432
But we'll meet again.

404
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:41,993
Put it back.

405
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,154
Come on!

406
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,392
We made two mistakes.

407
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,670
The first was thinking
your release was a police trap.

408
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,031
The second was thinking
this made you a threat.

409
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:18,554
That's why I tried to kill you.

410
01:16:20,559 --> 01:16:23,233
Now we feel we should begin again.

411
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,554
Here's the balance of the money

412
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,398
you're owed for Martey's killing.

413
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:58,477
You guaranteed
there'd be no problems.

414
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,952
Imagine how we felt
when you were arrested.

415
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,274
We have the same again for you.

416
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,108
Two million old francs.

417
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:15,152
Payable in advance this time.

418
01:17:15,519 --> 01:17:17,317
It's the same kind of job,

419
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,593
another contract.

420
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:22,759
Nothing to say?

421
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,076
Not with a gun on me.

422
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:27,988
Is that a principle?

423
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:30,554
It's a habit.

424
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:46,196
Get up.

425
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:53,352
Here's my answer: who sent you?

426
01:17:53,559 --> 01:17:56,233
I can't tell you that.

427
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:59,000
Yet you could try to kill me.

428
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:00,554
Look at me.

429
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,799
I'll ask you just once more.

430
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:06,959
Who? Name and address.

431
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:10,916
You don't know him.
He's not in our league.

432
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,388
Don't keep me waiting.

433
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,149
Olivier Rey.

434
01:18:18,599 --> 01:18:19,635
The address.

435
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,950
73 boulevard de Montmorency.

436
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,638
That's how you became unemployed.

437
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:37,590
Tell me about the new contract.

438
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:44,716
He found the bug, so he'll be
more on his guards than ever.

439
01:18:45,519 --> 01:18:50,196
Stick to him like glue
as soon as he leaves home.

440
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,348
Everything's ready. He knows
the metro like the back of his hand.

441
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:58,711
We'll shadow him step by step.
And no slip-ups this time.

442
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,594
You're in charge of the cars.

443
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,269
You'll be in the metro,
with 50 men and 20 auxiliaries.

444
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,794
Each man carries a transmitter.

445
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,629
When in contact with Costello,
he switches it this way.

446
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,791
Losing contact, he switches it that way.

447
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,230
The next contact does the same.

448
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:22,867
I'll be here, keeping the cars in touch
with what's happening below.

449
01:19:23,479 --> 01:19:24,389
Move.

450
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:42,596
- Car 1 1 checking in.
- Car 1 3 checking in.

451
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:46,551
- Car 38 checking in.
- Car 4 1 checking in.

452
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:52,357
That's it, contact established.

453
01:23:25,319 --> 01:23:27,389
Contact broken, he got off at Jourdain.

454
01:23:27,599 --> 01:23:29,237
Re-establish contact at all costs.

455
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,911
A car to Place des Fetes station,

456
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,395
to Botzaris, to Pre Saint-Gervais.

457
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:14,712
Message received.

458
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:19,197
Car 1 67 to Botzaris station.
Car 1 6 to Place des Fetes.

459
01:24:19,399 --> 01:24:22,277
Car 39 to Pre Saint-Gervais. Over.

460
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,393
Wrong platform.

461
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:15,149
What's happened?

462
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,035
- What?
- We lost him.

463
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,069
He shook off an auxiliary.

464
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:23,875
I'm covering all exits.
I don't think he's left yet.

465
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,911
- Enough auxiliaries?
- I'm expecting more.

466
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,509
Some cars aren't here yet.

467
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:31,153
Let's hope he picks an exit
that's already covered.

468
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:33,429
- The platforms?
- They're OK.

469
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,515
I warn you, Jef, this is the last time.

470
01:30:55,639 --> 01:30:56,709
All right.

471
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:58,959
- You heard me?
- I think so. I had a feeling...

472
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:02,792
Maybe I was just hoping
you would come.

473
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:07,474
Trouble?

474
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,393
Because of me?

475
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:19,709
You've never meant trouble for me.

476
01:32:26,359 --> 01:32:27,679
They gave you a hard time?

477
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:32,714
What about you?

478
01:32:35,399 --> 01:32:36,799
Do you need me?

479
01:32:38,519 --> 01:32:41,795
Yes, you do.
What do you want me to do?

480
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,795
What do you want me to do, Jef?

481
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,955
Nothing.

482
01:33:06,599 --> 01:33:08,955
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

483
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,158
What do you want?

484
01:34:10,599 --> 01:34:11,919
You got your money?

485
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:15,192
You accept the new contract?

486
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,392
You shouldn't have come here.

487
01:34:21,479 --> 01:34:22,355
I'm just leaving.

488
01:37:08,559 --> 01:37:10,072
Don't stay here.

489
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,158
Why, Jef?

490
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:31,152
I've been paid to...

491
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,638
That was a narrow squeak.

492
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,035
But for us, you'd be dead.

493
01:38:28,229 --> 01:38:32,330
No, you wouldn't.
