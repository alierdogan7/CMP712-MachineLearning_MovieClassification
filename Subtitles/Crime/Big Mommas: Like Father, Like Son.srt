You people might think that it's

You want to go?

17
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,102
No! You will not get your mail till I get to your house.

18
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,105
Don't make me use the PIT maneuver.

19
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,649
I will get to your house when I get to your house!

20
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,534
Get out of the truck.

21
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,370
Put your hands in the air.

22
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,081
What is wrong with you? You
could've stopped back there.

23
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,874
You made me have to chase you, man.

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,460
Please, God, let someone be taping this in the bushes.

25
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,087
Just give me what I want. Whoa, whoa.

26
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,505
That's a federal offense, all right?

27
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,298
Only the mailman touches the mail.

28
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,300
You do realize I'm packing, don't you?

29
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,635

00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,861
Okay. Fair enough.

38
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,780
Steam Clean Carpet Service.

39
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,116

00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,161
Duke University! Boo-ya!

42
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,000
Come here!

43
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,754
Come here! Come here! I'm warning you.

44
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,182
I know it's college decision day,

45
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,225
but you win the crazy parent award!

46
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,019
Thick. Thick, thick.

00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,273
My boy got in. My boy got in!

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,358
Thank you.

49
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,110
Hey!

50
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,863
Don't be surprised when I lose your tax refund!

51
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,783
Hey! Trent!

52
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,997
Trent!

53
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,795
You up there?

54
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,633
Whoo! Trent, you're on your way.

55
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,804
Desert Retreat.

56
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,889
Hi.

57
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,558
I need to speak to my wife, Sherrie.

58
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,727
I'm sorry, no phone calls allowed.

59
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,855
Yeah, well, I know no phone calls allowed,

60
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,442
but, you see, it's an emergency.
Our son just got accepted...

61
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,695
Sir, your wife is in complete isolation
for the next 72 hours.

62
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,990
Come on. It's a mind-body retreat.

63
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,492
It's not Area 51.

64
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,494
Uh-oh! Please take a soothing breath with me.

65
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,081
No, I will not take a soothing breath with you.

66
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,916
Namaste. But I can come down there

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,584
and snatch that ponytail off your head.

68
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,794
Namaste.

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,841
Duke University.

70
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,052
What? Malcolm?

71
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,679
Speaking.

72
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,013
It's Jason Bourne.

73
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,100
I told you, we don't use code names.

74
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,769
You take all the fun away, Chocolate
Thunder, you know that?

75
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,521
All right. What do you want, Nicky?

76
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,400
The exchange is tonight, 11 :00 p.m.

77
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,819
You got what they want?

78
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,362
Yeah, as long as you got what I want.

79
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,365
And listen, I'm thinking now Bali.

80
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,287
Well, you know, there's no witness
protection program in Bali.

81
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,497
But don't worry, we're gonna take care of you.

82
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:55,294
All right, then Mexico. But not Cabo!
It's gotten way too touristy.

83
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,880
Hello? Chocolate?

84
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,676
Trent! Hey, Malcolm.

85
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,885
Where are you?

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,178
I'm, uh... I'm at the library.

87
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,722
Library. Yeah.

88
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,889
But it's noisy.

89
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,057
It's Book Appreciation Day.

90
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,144
But look. Trent, we need to talk, all right?

91
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,480
So, come home soon. We got to talk.

92
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,316
Uh, I'm losing you. All right.

93
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,323
Yeah!

94
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,408
I'm a lyrical miracle

95
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,951
Hey! Baby!

96
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,828
Quick-witted, better get with it, stay sick with it

97
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,456
They saying I'm a lyrical miracle

98
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,041
Hey! Baby

I'm automatic, a rap fanatic Let me do my thing

100

104
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,184
Looking at that shorty, she's
a cutie What's your name?

105
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,395
Baby, you should call me I can
scoop you and we can hang

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,689
Okay, if not, then I ain't twisting your arm

107
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,942
But don't be trying to holler at
me when you're singing along

108
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,236
I'm a lyrical miracle

109
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,613
Hey! Baby

110
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,448
Quick-witted, better get with it, stay sick with it

111
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,117
They saying I'm a lyrical miracle

112
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,702
Hey! Baby

113
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,372
I'm automatic, a rap fanatic Let me do my thing

114
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,509
Hey, y'all, the Prodi-G's a little parched.

115
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,427
I'll be back for a second set, a'ight?

116
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,558
Library? How'd you find me?

117
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,060
The Bureau tracked your phone.

118
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,729
Thank God my dad's an orthodontist.

119
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,482
For real. That's some Nazi Germany shnizzle.

120
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,401
Let's talk, now. Uh-uh.

121
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,277
Scratch and Rembrandt are my family.

122
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,114
Whatever you got to say, you can say in front of them.

123
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,407
Oh, family.

124
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,491
Mmm-hmm.

125
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,245
Ah. All right, well, in my family,
we give out ass-whuppins.

126
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,833
And right now, I'm looking at a
lot of fresh, unwhupped ass!

127
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,710
Yeah. A little... This little...

128
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,588
You have a great day, Mr. Turner!

129
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,133
Hey, Trent, we love you, but
I ain't with no ass-whuppin'.

130
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,593
Yo, hold it down. Sell some CDs!

131
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,678
Okay.

132
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:10,971
Why'd you embarrass me like that?

133
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,139
I'm embarrassing you?

134
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,473
Trent, you got a lot to learn.

135
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,599
Come on, Malcolm.

136
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,270
You know, it wouldn't hurt to call
me "Dad" every once in a while.

137
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,865
All right, let's rewind. This should
be a happy day. All right?

138
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,617
Yeah, but I ain't the one who brought the rain.

139
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,244
Some great news came in.

140
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,912
I know. They called me.

141
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,957
Yeah, I'm just like, wait till they hear my new stuff.

142
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,460
Right? I'm talking about fire, man!

143
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,587
New stuff? What are you talking about?

144
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,797
Wait. What are you talking about?

145
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,299
I'm talking about Duke!

146
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,051
Oh. No, look, forget college, man.

147
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,471
So check this out. This promoter
got a hold of my mix tape.

148
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,015
The Achievement, Volume One. Right?

149
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,894
So, he's putting together this tour of
young MCs in the fall and the winter

150
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,562
called The Freshman Class, right?

151
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,856
Entire East Coast and Cincinnati!

152
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,985
Trent. People don't go to Cincinnati.
They leave Cincinnati.

153
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,571
The only catch is

154
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,698
I'm not 18 yet,

155
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,075
so I'm gonna need you to sign this contract.

156
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,911
Because the Prodi-G is still a minor.

157
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,995
In age only.

158
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,330
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

159
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,500
You got into Duke today. You're a Blue Devil now!

160
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,752
So? So that's your dream!

161
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,670
No, that's your dream.

162
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,005
I ain't going to no lame college

163
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,715
when I can be on the road, making money!

164
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,092
I ain't signing that contract.

165
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,178
You gotta give it a rest.

166
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,014
I'm just saying, this is my big break, man!

167
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,433
And if I don't have the contract signed in five days,

168
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,103
they're gonna have some wack
ringtone rapper from St. Louis.

169
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,608
Trent, you have the rest of your life to go on the road.

170
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,777
But for these next four years...

171
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,278
Four years?

172
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,489
You're joking, right? You're joking.

173
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,116
Like, you know how long that is in hip-hop years?

174
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,994
Aw, come on, Malcolm, look at this. Look.

175
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,705
It's a blueprint for a house of success.

176
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,791
All built on a strong, strong flow.

177
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,794
A strong flow. Yeah.

178
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,547
Well, you need an education.

179
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,049
What are you gonna do when that flow dries up?

180
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,552
I'll just transition into acting.

181
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,305
Oh, man. Every time you open your mouth,

182
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,434
you prove to me just how important
an education really is.

183
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,604
You're lucky your mother's not here

184
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,981
to hear you talk that crazy talk.

185
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,151
Oh, Mom. Let's call Mom. She'll
let me. Let's ring Mom up.

186
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,403
Go ahead, call her.

187
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,947
When you tell her that you want to throw away college,

188
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,908
she's probably gonna bust that
little vein in her forehead.

189
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,326
It's gonna pop!

190
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,911
Yeah...

191
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,914
Okay. But not when she sees the
mansion I'm gonna buy her.

192
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,249
Ha! Come on.

193
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,503
Only thing I'm signing is a check to Duke. End of story.

194
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,256
Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go to work.

195
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,507
You know, some of us work.

196
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,092
I'm on the grind. You feel me?

197
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,176
I feel you.

198
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,595
You feel me? Yeah, I feel you.

199
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,348
You feel? Yeah.

200
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,226
But I'm talking swimming pools.
You feeling private security.

201
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,103
Come on, we can do it together, Malcolm!

202
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,064
Damn!

203
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,737
Trent. What's up, man?

204
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,946
Hey, did he sign it?

205
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,906
No, he didn't sign it yet.

206
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,745
All right, so phase two. Ambush
the man when he's at his grind.

207
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,205
He'll give you an autograph just to get rid of you.

208
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,418
Yeah. Ambush him at his grind. I'm feeling you.

209
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,794
That's right!

210
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,797
See? That's why I keep you on payroll.

211
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,427
Hands away from your chest. You're
gonna dirty the recording.

212
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,262
Sorry. You got the drive, right?

213
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,430
Yeah.

214
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,568
There's nothing on this.

215
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,736
Smart, huh?

216
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,239
Are you kidding me? No.

217
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,532
It's insurance.

218
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,826
'Cause I was thinking, what if they
don't give me the money?

219
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,370
What if they check the drive, just like I did?

220
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,455
Oh.

221
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,541
Well, the real one's hidden.

222
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,293
It's in a safe place where no one will
ever look, so don't worry about it.

223
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,753
You idiot. Where is it?

224
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,839
Where's my witness protection plan?

225
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,091
It's gonna be in a casket if you
don't tell me where it is.

226
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,217
All right.

227
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,888
The Georgia Girls School for the Arts.

228
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,098
What?

229
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,725
I got a buddy who works there.

230
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,101
Unbelievable!

231
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,314
Crawford. Yeah, Malcolm.

232
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,109
Canetti brought a dummy flash.

233
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,487
Yeah, well, he told me where the
real one is, but there's no time.

234
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,200
We're just gonna have to get Chirkoff
to make the exchange. Yeah.

235
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,618
All right.

236
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,954
Hey. Let's go.

237
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,889
Canetti, can you hear me?

238
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,474
Yeah, I got you, Chocolate. Go ahead.

239
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,185
Look, if anything goes wrong, get out of there.

240
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,026
Hey, fellas. Vlad and Dmitri, right?

241
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,159
Mr. Chirkoff.

242
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,953
Hey, it's good to see you again.

243
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,082
Rosetta Stone. Pretty good, huh?

244
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,460
Whoa, whoa! It's the Prodi-G!

245
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,004
Trent, what the hell are you doing here?

246
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,342
Guaranteeing my future. Sign my contract.

247
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,094
Hey, get in here and sit down! Stay down!

248
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:10,139
You think I'm stupid, huh? You think I'm a stupid man.

249
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,184
No, I think you're probably a very intelligent man.

250
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,435
I mean, I don't know you that well.

251
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,312
Autograph it, please.

252
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,856
I'm not talking to you.

253
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,232
Who are you talking to?

254
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,652
I'm talking to the people on
the other end of your chest.

255
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:30,285
Oh, this? There's nobody there, man.
This is part of my hearing aid.

256
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,704
Get out of the car and hide, now.

257
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,746
What's going on?

258
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,373
Get out of the car and hide, now! What's going on?

259
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,710
I'm a little hard of hearing in my right ear.

260
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,503
Really? Show me. Yeah.

261
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,088
I can't show you. It's... Show me!

262
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,591
All right. Take it easy. Take it easy.
I'll show you everything.

263
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,219
FBI! Come and get your snitch!

264
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,431
You want to come and play?

265
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,477
Drop it.

266
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,812
Drop it!

267
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,858
All right. Give me Canetti, or I take him out.

268
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,426
Music...

269
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,386
What?

270
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,514
It's in the music...

271
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,700
Yo. Look...

272
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,245
I didn't see anything. Yo, we cool?

273
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,872
Come on, man! Come on!

274
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,879
Come on.

275
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,217
Oh, my God, they're shooting! Where are we going?

276
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,052
Get in the truck. Okay, okay!

277
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,225
Oh, my God!

278
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,234
Get down!

279
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,495
Are you okay?

280
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,621
I think so.

281
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,374
Do you have any idea how lucky we are right now?

282
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,501
You could have been killed! What were you thinking?

283
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,170
He just shot
that guy right in front of me.

284
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,256
We're still here, all right? That's what matters.

285
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,216
Shouldn't we call the FBI or something?

286
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,428
No. FBI has got a leak. Chirkoff knew we were coming.

287
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,054
Malcolm, I want to go home, man.

288
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,764
Trent. Your car's back there.

289
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,349
They probably already ran your tags.

290
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,767
They know everything about us.

291
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,686
You just saw Chirkoff murder someone.

292
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,521
We can't go home. So, what, then?

293
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,356
That means he's gonna kill me?

294
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,191
Oh, come on! That is not hot.

295
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,862
I won't let him. All right? All I got
to do is get that flash drive.

296
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,698
It has enough dirt on Chirkoff to put him away forever.

297
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,408
Payoff, hits, everything.

298
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,493
Canetti told me where the flash is hidden.

299
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,704
We're just gonna lay low until I can get my hands on it.

300
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:24,292
Just calm down, all right? Relax.
Take a soothing breath.

301
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,387
They haven't called in yet and you
have no idea where they are.

302
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,014
You're the FBI!

303
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,100
What good is a leak if you can't tell me anything?

304
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,144
Just send me the photo.

305
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,646
How's the leg, boss? The leg's fine!

306
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,486
The FBI's run travel records, rental cars. Nothing.

307
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,156
They haven't left the area, at least not yet.

308
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,992
What about the flash drive?

309
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,494
Turner knows where it is.

310
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,038
We find Turner, we find the flash drive.

311
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,582
Right now, our biggest problem's his kid.

312
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,709
He saw me shoot Canetti.

313
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,836
I want him dead.

314
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,468
I got 15 MP3s of original stuff that ain't been mixed.

315
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,969
You can have that.

316
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,848
Georgia Girls School for the Arts.

317
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,226
You know what, just do like Pac's mom did.

318
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,435
After I'm shot down in the streets,

319
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,853
just release it as a double jam.

320
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,148
Would you knock off the crazy talk?
We gonna get out of this.

321
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,235
Yeah. That's probably what Biggie thought

322
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,861
when he was staring down the barrel.

323
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,906
Or Pac, when he was chilling on the Strip.

324
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,952
I got a plan.

325
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,453
You know what? Malcolm,

326
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,955
just promise me one thing.

327
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,081
What?

328
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,041
Don't let them do a clean version for Walmart.

329
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,794
Preserve who the Prodi-G was.

330
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,587
I'm going to hide you.

331
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,880
Hide?

332
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,510
I mean, come on. How you gonna
hide a swag as big as this?

333
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,816
I'm gonna need a shrink after this, you realize that?

334
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,776
You didn't seem to mind when you was little and

335
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,111
I caught you trying on your mother's...

336
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,237
Shh!

337
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,865
You promised never to bring that
up. I was putting on a play.

338
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,199
Lord, Lord!

339
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,202
You a difficult child, Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

340
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,037
Who are you talking about?

341
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,164
My great-niece.

342
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,540
And you better start sounding like her

343
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,624
before you scare someone.

344
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,168
Oh, right.

345
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,669
In that case, how's this?

346
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,838
Swing low, sweet...

347
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,800
Holy mother of...

348
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,846
Yeah. Yeah, right there. Now remember that feeling.

349
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,601
Fine! If I gotta be a chick, can I at least be a cute one?

350
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,437
Next time I'll buy my own damn clothes!

351
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,398
And pull down that skirt!

352
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,442
I can see straight to the Promised Land.

353
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,444
It's pulled down!

354
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,782
After a while, you realize it's just not worth the fight.

355
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,327
I wasn't even talking to you.

356
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,787
Nosy and all in my business!

357
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,581
Wait up!

358
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,213
You think you might
have a chance I don't think so

359
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,591
You telling me to be nice I don't think so

360
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,761
You wanna get in my pants I don't think so

361
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,312
I don't think so

362
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,563
I don't understand

363
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,316
how we're gonna find a 4-inch
flash drive in 3-inch heels.

364
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,151
Canetti had a buddy who works here.

365
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,821
We start by finding out who that
is, and what they know.

366
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,823
Canetti.

367
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,742
Canetti, yeah.

368
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,203
Canetti said something to me right before he died.

369
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,538
He looked at me and he said...

370
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,583
What'd he say?

371
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,834
"It's in the music."

372
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,671
Yeah. You know, something like that.

373
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,340
And I thought he recognized my talent,
knew who the Prodi-G was.

374
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,841
"It's in the music"? Yeah.

375
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,969
Doesn't make sense,

376
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,513
just like everything else that comes out of your mouth.

377
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,307
What? I'm gonna tell you what don't make sense.

378
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,270
How they gonna let two fat ladies
go poking around this joint.

379
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,064
They have an opening for a house mother.

380
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,941
Say what?

381
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,444
Park your tush.

382
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,072
Tuck it! Right over there.

383
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,283
Hi, girl. Hi. Hi.

384
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,868
Hi.

385
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,627
She's expecting me. I's running a little late.

386
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,379
Come in!

387
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,633
May I help you?

388
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,261
Honey, it's me who's gonna help you,

389
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,264
and those poor, house motherless girls you got

390
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,266
just waiting for a positive role model.

391
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,603
Hattie Mae Pierce at your service,
but you can call me Big Momma.

392
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:59,442
Oh, yes. You e-mailed your résumé
for the house mother position.

393
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,444
Very qualified, but I think...

394
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,487
Well, thank you!

395
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,407
I will watch over those girls like they were my own.

396
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,242
But, Miss...

397
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,829
Big Momma, we haven't scheduled
any interviews, let alone...

398
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,751
Look at what those children did to me!

399
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,754
Performance art, my ass!

400
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,630
Beverly, what on earth?

401
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,801
Double-ply? A public school can afford double-ply

402
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,595
and I got to bring in my own Sweet'N Low?

403
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,848
Child, nobody deserves to be treated like that.

404
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,850
That's not the half!

405
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,354
Damn!

406
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,316
Child, you should quit while you
can still do a comb over.

407
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,070
No, Beverly, you promised us two weeks' notice.

408
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:48,407
You know, every day you don't demand
respect, you die just a little.

409
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,118
You die a little.

410
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,373
You know, she's right. Nothing's worth
living with those demon spawn!

411
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,541
"No child left behind."

412
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,336
Well, you watch me. I quit!

413
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,803
Can you start today?

414
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,139
Me? Oh, thank you! Sure!

415
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,599
Now, we don't pay very much.

416
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,393
Oh, don't worry about that.

417
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,228
Shoot, I grew up so poor,

418
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,146
we used to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken

419
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,731
and lick other people's fingers.

420
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,650
Because we couldn't afford the chicken.

421
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,820
And you know, all the grease from
the chicken, we were like...

422
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,865
You know, there is one tiny little issue.

423
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,867
What's that?

424
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,246
Hey. What up?

425
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:41,043
Miss Gail, this is my great-niece,

426
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,170
Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

427
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,672
Hello. Hey.

428
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,092
So many girls! I feel like I'm at a Baskin-Robbins.

429
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,052
A festival of flavors!

430
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,182
I mean, um, it's so diverse here.

431
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,978
Ah, yes. Well, we do pride ourselves on diversity.

432
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,983
So tell me, Charmaine, do you think
that you're a good fit for GGSA?

433
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,695
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm. I like to read.

434
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,157
And, uh, I like to, uh,

435
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,658
play music.

436
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,494
And I like salad.

437
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,582
Sweet, delicious, fresh fruit salad.

438
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,919
She's had a stressful few days.

439
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,131
She's only with me because of some family problems.

440
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,717
Mmm-hmm. My parents don't support my art.

441
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,135
They think it's a waste of time.

442
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,097
Oh, dear, that is awful. Well, you
have come to the right place.

443
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,308
And my stepfather's always working.

444
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,268
He has an important job in the government.

445
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,145
Which he uses to spy on me.

446
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,939
Ever told the truth, wouldn't have to.

447
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,029
Charmaine, you can audit classes
until your transcripts get here,

448
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,822
but I'm afraid, since it's the end of the year,

449
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,407
we don't have a roommate for you.

450
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,284
Oh, any ol' girl will do.

451
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,244
Oh, no. We don't want to put you out.

452
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,747
Charmaine'll just stay with her Big Momma.

453
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,667
But my shrink in juvie said I'd do better
with a role model my own age.

454
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,503
You'll be on the same floor as your peers.

455
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,837
Before you know it, you'll be bosom buddies.

456
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,590
Charmaine likes the sound of that!

457
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,433
Welcome to your new home.

458
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,644
I'll just show you to your room.

459
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,354
Some of the girls have gone to dinner,

460
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,980
so you'll just see them there.

461
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,023
Okay.

462
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,483
Oh, there's Mia! Mia.

463
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,152
Damn!

464
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,115
Mia, this is your new house mother, Big Momma,

465
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,701
and this is her niece, Charmaine, your new classmate.

466
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,786
Hi.

467
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,121
Mia is a very promising young actress.

468
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,459
Oh, I'm okay. I mean, I can do light
comedy, like Sandra Bullock.

469
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,670
Well, you know, before the Oscar.

470
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,713
But I really need to work on expanding my range,

471
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,340
in the way that Kate Winslet does.

472
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,051
And Mrs. Orth from Movement says that
I need to listen to my inner voice,

473
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,553
but there's just so many of them,

474
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,390
and the loudest one's always screaming,
"Delanté's pulling away!"

475
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,891
My God! Delanté's pulling away.

476
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,353
I think I should go now.

477
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,938
Girl, you need a hug!

478
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,484
She gets a little emotional. Who the hell is Delanté?

479
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,820
Delanté is the boyfriend.

480
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,196
Oh.

481
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,659
Gail, maybe we should freshen up before dinner.

482
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,580
All this transition is a bit much for Charmaine.

483
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,748
She should probably rest her eyes

484
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,585
or become unconscious for a moment or two.

485
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,838
I totally understand. Your room
is at the end of the hall.

486
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,634
Well, look at the wallpaper! It's so nice!

487
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,681
Look. There's a ballerina on the bed.

488
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,766
I'm Jasmine.

489
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,895
And here's the 411 you probably
didn't get on your tour.

490
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,814
I call the shots around here.

491
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,940
So, if you two stay out of the way,

492
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,567
we shouldn't have any problems.

493
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,818
Okay?

494
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,656
Now you listen to me, Tinker Bell.

495
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,743
Big Momma don't take orders from nobody.

496
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,494
Nobody.

497
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,332
We'll see about that.

498
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,379
Towel girl was nice.

499
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,215
I'm going to unpack.

500
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,819
You mind? Do you mind?

501
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:40,491
Ooh. Sit down with such lovely young ladies.

502
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,665
Excuse me.

503
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,376
Charmaine!

504
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,169
Find a seat.

505
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,879
Sit next to me.

506
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,964
Oh! All right.

507
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,758
Thank you. Excuse me.

508
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,012
Ooh! Careful. Oh, my gosh. Here,
let me help clean you up.

509
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,722
It's cool.

510
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,599
I'm Haley Robinson.

511
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,727
Hey!

512
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,938
You're...

513
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,565
You're the hot
girl from the Promenade. Yeah.

514
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,942
I'm sorry?

515
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,822
I mean, you're not hot.

516
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,575
The Promenade
was hot the day I saw you.

517
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,204
I'm not saying you're not hot,

518
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,541
but it was hot at the Promenade
the day I saw you being hot.

519
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,042
Girl, I'm hot.

520
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,877
I'm Charmaine.

521
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,170
You're funny.

522
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,971
I love that beat.

523
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:54,982
That's it. Excuse me, but I didn't
formally get to introduce myself.

524
00:28:55,358 --> 00:29:00,195
My name is Hattie Mae Pierce, but
everyone calls me Big Momma.

525
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,656
That's the understatement of the century.

526
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,159
Funny. Very funny.

527
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,038
And this is my niece, Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

528
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,123
Oh.

529
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,250
Hey. How you guys doing?

530
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,588
Mmm, that reminds me. You have
to do something before you eat.

531
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,715
Oh, girl, of course! Uh...

532
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,884
Attention, everyone! Give...

533
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,472
We have fresh meat that wants to eat.

534
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,934
And what kind of school is this?

535
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,853
School for the Arts!

536
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,398
Exactly. And that means every new student

537
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,860
must dance, act or sing for their supper.

538
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,906
What'll it be, Charmaine?

539
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,532
What's your talent?

540
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,620
Show us what you got.

541
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,079
Show us what you got.

542
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,041
Show us what you got. Show us what you got.

543
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,927
Charmaine...

544
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,554
Quiet! Quiet!

545
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:14,311
Anyway, Charmaine is a little
under the weather right now.

546
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,854
Maybe she could do it another night.

547
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,316
Oh, no, it's all right, Big Momma. I got this.

548
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,568
So what'll it be, Charmaine?

549
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,570
Huh. I'm a rapper.

550
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,406
I can't wait to see this.

551
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,872
Hey, could somebody give me a beat?

552
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,501
Yeah.

553
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,003
What

554
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,215
Yeah

555
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,634
All my girls in the spot You know what's up

556
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,719
Just chillin' in the caf For some laughs and stuff

557
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,805
Ready to do my thing Y'all ready or what?

558
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,517
Show your girl some love Hah... Yeah... What...

559
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,611
Hello? All girls school?

560
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,531
Give your girl some love.

561
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,047
Don't wanna give it up? Yeah, I'm cool with that

562
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,091
That's fine Besides, who knew I could rap?

563
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,385
I got skills, thrills plus a winning attitude

564
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,512
I got no time for no wack dudes

565
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,389
You don't even know what I got under here

566
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,434
If you feel the same way Let me
hear you say, "Hell, yeah!"

567
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,852
Hell, yeah!

568
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,354
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh!

569
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,565
Ain't nobody

570
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,152
Loves me better Makes me happy

571
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,779
Makes me feel this way

572
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,364
Ain't nobody

573
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,660
Loves me better than you

574
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,579
Yeah My girl Haley is the truth

575
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,748
And even though I'm new, she
done made it real smooth

576
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,791
It's kind of hard being new on the block

577
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,668
Especially when you're packin' a supersized

578
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,962
Badonkadonk!

579
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,590
Whoa

580
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,467
Ain't nobody

581
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,427
Loves me better

582
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,638
Makes me happy

583
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,848
Makes me feel this way

584
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,475

Loves me better than you

586
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,106
Yo, Haley, get up on the mic

587
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,733
Keep talking about the guy you like

588
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,277
First you put your arms around me

589
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,904
Then what else did he do, girl?

590
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,114
Then you put your charms around me

591
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,116
Okay Do you think he'd be true?

592
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,577
I can't resist your sweet surrender

593
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,287
Sounds like a good deal to me

594
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,706
Oh, my nights are warm and tender

595
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,833
Come on! Everybody sing!

596
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,217
Ain't nobody

597
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,386
Loves me better

598
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,179
Makes me happy

599
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,807
Makes me feel this way

600
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:08,568
Ain't nobody Loves me better

601
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:13,323
Makes me happy Makes me feel this way

602
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,952
Ain't nobody Loves me better

603
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,080
Come on, Big Momma, show us what you got!

604
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,918
Go, Momma! Go, Momma!
Go, Momma! Go, Momma!

605
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,913
Oh, my gosh! Big Momma, are
you okay? Are you alive?

606
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,957
Ain't nobody?

607
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,891
Child? That there is no meal.

608
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,642
I'm on a diet.

609
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,271
Prima ballerinas can't have any booty.
There's a law or something.

610
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,482
Well, she looks so skinny,

611
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,234
it looks like she could dodge raindrops.

612
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,529
Ain't no raindrops going...

613
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,198
Oh, my God!

614
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,449
Mia, what's going on?

615
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,868
Delanté just dumped me.

616
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,745
What?

617
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,540
"Need space. Still friends?"

618
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,626
He used the sunglasses guy.

619
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,669
You know what? He's probably just confused.

620
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,338
Yeah, he's afraid of intimacy.

621
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,631
He just doesn't want to get hurt.

622
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,508
You think?

623
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,636
Uh, can't you girls read? A man needs his space.

624
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,138
It says it clearly in black and white.

625
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,640
Duh!

626
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,852
Oh, my God.

627
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,899
Or

628
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:14,069
he's petrified by his passion

629
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,322
and he, uh, doesn't know how to deal with it.

630
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:21,243
Girl, the sunglasses guy means that
he's hiding his true emotions.

631
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,744
Mmm-hmm. He loves you, girl.

632
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,246
Exactly.

633
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,750
Child, like my Aunt Yorima used to say,

634
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,128
it's better to be alone with yourself
for the rest of your life

635
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,423
than to be together with bad company for a minute.

636
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,386
I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life?

637
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,804
Child, I did not say that.

638
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,097
No, Mia, don't listen to her.

639
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,307
Oh, my God, I can't do this!

640
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,060
I was trying to give her...

641
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,270
Great job, Big Momma.

642
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,521
Any other hearts you want to break?

643
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,984
Ladies, quiet down, please!

644
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,945
Thank you. I have an announcement.

645
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,574
Last night, an antique music box was stolen

646
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,659
from our library's special collection.

647
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,037
Now, I know we have a tradition of pranks.

648
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,417
But this is not stealing the mascot
from the boys at St. Ignatius.

649
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,169
Which is still missing, by the way.

650
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,671
No, this is a crime

651
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,883
against one of our own, which will not be tolerated!

652
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,636
So I strongly suggest that the guilty party,

653
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,265
or anyone who knows anything
about this, come forward

654
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,475
or risk immediate expulsion.

655
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,439
The music box. That's what Canetti
was trying to tell you.

656
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,940
What do you mean?

657
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,484
The flash drive's in the music box!

658
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,194
Oh, right, right.

659
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,947
Come on. We're going to the library.
That's where it was stolen.

660
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,490
I just... Where are you going?

661
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,201
These shoes! They hurt. They're heels.

662
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,829
And this girdle's riding up all inside me. I can't do it.

663
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,124
All right, but stay in your room
and away from those girls.

664
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,542
All right.

665
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,712
Mmm, I gotta take a leak.

666
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,314
Ah, man.

667
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,441
This thing is so tight!

668
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,622
Free at last, free at last.

669
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,875
Yeah?

670
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,127
Charmaine?

671
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,382
Um...

672
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,300
I'll be out in a second!

673
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:49,599
Give me...

674
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,401
Um, are you all right in there?

675
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,568
Yeah!

676
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,404
I'm okay!

677
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,324
I'll be out there in a minute!

678
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,244
Hey...

679
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,745
Damn. I mean...

680
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,081
Hey, Haley.

681
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,171
Um...

682
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,591
I hope I'm not being too personal,
but have you tried Spanx?

683
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,468
Spanx?

684
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,345
You know, body shapers.

685
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:31,766
You know, they give you the smoothing
without the, um, extra padding.

686
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,102
Oh, really?

687
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,981
That extra padding!

688
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,817
Anyway, they're having a thing for me

689
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,861
in the common room in about 15 minutes.

690
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,571
I'd love you to come.

691
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,740
How nice of you. That'd be great.

692
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,241
Great. So, I'll see you in a few.

693
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:49,325
All right.

694
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,619
And wear your PJs. We go comfy.

695
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,788
You certainly do.

696
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,074
Excuse me!

697
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,743
Excuse me!

698
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,122
My, my, my.

699
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,208
Ooh, Lord.

700
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,711
My, my, my!

701
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,424
I'm peeping one fly Zulu queen! Mmm!

702
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,095
Well, the name is Hattie Mae Pierce,

703
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,846
but everybody calls me Big Momma.

704
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,642
Well, I'm Kurtis Kool. I make the ladies drool.

705
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,480
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna
keep my saliva in my mouth.

706
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:06,027
Well, back in the day, I used to
run the ropes for Run-DMC.

707
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,364
You probably recognize me from
my appearance in Krush Groove.

708
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,366
I was the brother with the dope
shammy in the car wash.

709
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,037
I had no lines, but I was good. No?

710
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,916
My last tour was with LL Cool J.

711
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,126
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

712
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,255
In the words of the great master,
"Mama said knock you out!"

713
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,675
Young man.

714
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,219
I am a woman with grandchildren.

715
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,806
Now, I'm the new house mother over in Pryce Hall.

716
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,059
And I'm just trying to get a lay of the land.

717
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,686
I was wondering

718
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,648
if I could get a peek around the library.

719
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,528
Well, Kurtis Kool be your backstage pass!

720
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,988
Kurtis Kool!

721
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,281
Let me get my key.

722
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,953
Well, all right. Shed a little light.

723
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,956
You know, my momma said big-legged
women were gonna kill me.

724
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,209
Found my keys!

725
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,963
You ready to go? Yeah. This way?

726
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,423
Uh-huh.

727
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,675
Halle Berry ain't got shit on you!

728
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,311
Hello.

729
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,065
Oh, Lord, I must be in heaven.

730
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,068
Who invited America's sexiest buffalo?

731
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,197
I invited her.

732
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,698
Be nice.

733
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,368
Oh, no.

734
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,541
What are we doing, sacrificing an animal or something?

735
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,919
We are the Divas.

736
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,422
The senior society of GGSA's best artists.

737
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,965
This is our inner sanctum.

738
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,468
Oh.

739
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,553
Can we trust her not to narc us out?

740
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,222
I ain't no narc.

741
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,389
That's what a narc would say.

742
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,558
That's true. Good point.

743
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,144
Good point? Girl,

744
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:07,565
let me tell you something about
Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

745
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,734
My ex-boyfriend, right?

746
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,402
Marlo.

747
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,197
Doing a bid in Lompoc. Dealing.

748
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,325
Po-po dragged me in on a trumped-up conspiracy case.

749
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,495
Said if I testified against him, I could walk.

750
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,829
Know what I did?

751
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,248
What?

752
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,291
Spent my 1 5th birthday in juvie.

753
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,420
My birthday cake was four lit matches in a Twinkie.

754
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,548
Oh, my God. How awful!

755
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:37,720
Okay, everyone. We are assembled tonight
to welcome our newest Diva.

756
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,014
Haley Robinson.

757
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,600
Stand up.

758
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,147
This necklace is a commitment.

759
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,651
A commitment to your life as an artist.

760
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:55,113
That you will never give up on your friends or your art.

761
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,323
Do you accept? I do.

762
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,325
Turn around.

763
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,083
Done.

764
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,628
Congratulations. You're a Diva.

765
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,298
Uh, Jasmine? Where is your necklace?

766
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:16,217
I'm getting the clasp fixed.

767
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,510
Oh.

768
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:18,970
Welcome to the Divas.

769
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,311
"The Inaugural Class Music Box."

770
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:30,106
Yeah, the first graduating class gifted it to the school.

771
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,983
You open it, it'd play the school song.

772
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,069
Not really worth much, but it's sentimental.

773
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,407
Well, I can't imagine why anyone
would want to steal it.

774
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,243
Unless it had something valuable inside.

775
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,662
I doubt it. It's been there for so long.

776
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,331
But between you, me and the Kool,

777
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,375
I think the girls lifted it.

778
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,419
You sure?

779
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,838
Look, the other night, I'm wiping
down the reference room,

780
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,549
I hear the girls sneaking in, giggling.

781
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,719
I look in there, they peaced out.

782
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,721
And so is the music box.

783
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,473
Hmm.

784
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,977
I saw a picture of a man in your office.

785
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,188
He looked familiar.

786
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,024
My fishing buddy, Tony.

787
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,443
You probably read about it in the newspaper.

788
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,695
Anthony Canetti? That's it.

789
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,280
Yeah.

790
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,909
He just left here a couple days ago
for our monthly poker game.

791
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,494
It's a damn shame.

792
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,329
Uh...

793
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,749
These bobby pins don't stay put.

794
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:36,255
Look here, Big Momma, I got a couple
St. Ides on ice back at the crib.

795
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,717
Oh, no. No, Big Momma's a wine cooler woman.

796
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,136
And she's gotta get back to her girls.

797
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,307
Even a momma bear needs some sugar.

798
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,893
I said that's enough, now.

799
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,942
God, I forgive you for the '90s.

800
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,736
But thank you, Jesus, for now!

801
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,071
Mmm!

802
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,547
Yay!

803
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,636
Charmaine? You look like you
have on Big Momma's PJs.

804
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,346
I have something you could try on.

805
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,056
Oh, no, no, no, I couldn't.

806
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,809
But, uh, you could try it on for me.

807
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,227
Okay.

808
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,605
I know. Fashion show!

809
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,861
Could this get any better?

810
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:53,749
Okay!

811
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,936
Hey! Oh, you can wear this.

812
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,813
I don't know, I...

813
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,736
How entertaining.

814
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,323
Everybody back to their rooms, now!

815
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,158
Oh. And by the way,

816
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,162
until the thief who stole that music box comes forward,

817
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,957
lights out time, 8:00 p.m.

818
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,458
Bounce!

819
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,254
Oh, don't look with the sour faces. Let's go!

820
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,922
Don't you eyeball me, girl.

821
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,757
You just go on.

822
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,385
Don't corner-eye me!

823
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,387
We was bouncing it out.

824
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,889
You was bouncing it...

825
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:38,312
"Ten Ways to Snag a Guy"? That'll never work.

826
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,070
What's wrong with you? I told you
to stay away from those girls.

827
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,824
I was doing some undercover
work. Getting information.

828
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,245
Undercover. Yeah, well, that explains
you lounging in lingerie.

829
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,248
I was doing what girls do, okay?

830
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,209
Look, you gotta see the genius of my plan.

831
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,629
Your plan? Yeah.

832
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,507
These girls, they're starting to think I'm on their side.

833
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,592
Right.

834
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,385
The Divas are never gonna talk to you.

835
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,430
Not the way you run the house. Look.

836
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:16,225
You think the Jackson 5 gave
Papa Joe information? No.

837
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,186
Janet had all the dirt. And I'm their Janet!

838
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,647
Wait. Who the hell are the Divas?

839
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,441
Seriously? Yeah.

840
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,611
The most popular girls in school!

841
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,863
They're the best artists. They run this place.

842
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,448
Oh, you need me.

843
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,743
Trust me, I'm a seasoned FBI agent.

844
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:39,123
I've infiltrated tougher circles than
a posse of gossipy teenage girls.

845
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,793
So how about you stick to the hiding

846
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,295
and I'll stick to the undercover work?

847
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,131
Whatever.

848
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,133
I was just trying to help.

849
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,886
Please, do me a favor. Don't help.

850
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,471
Whatever!

851
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,604
Where'd you find Jasmine's necklace?

852
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,649
How'd you know this was Jasmine's?

853
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,734
Oh.

854
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,235
You don't need me.

855
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,989
You've infiltrated tougher circles than
a posse of gossipy teenage girls.

856
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,619
Okay, fine.

857
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,747
I might be able to use your help.

858
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,042
If I help you, you got to help me.

859
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,418
Help you what?

860
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,170
You've got to sign my contract.

861
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,881
How about I think about it?

862
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,842
How about I go back to reading my Cosmo?

863
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,474
Fine.

864
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,451
Nothing.

865
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,870
Just hundreds of these.

866
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,552
Not bad.

867
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,222
Turn it off, you idiot.

868
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,977
Let's go.

869
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,396
I know how to find them.

870
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,317
Charmaine, you're late
for class. Now get to ballet.

871
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,236
Demi plié.

872
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,412
Knees over the toes.

873
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,624
Chest up.

874
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,835
Shoulders back.

875
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,961
Out.

876
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,839
And grand plié!

877
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,513
And up.

878
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,182
I can't.

879
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,558
Oh!

880
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,102
Let's get into groups for the routine.

881
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,396
Jasmine, head up.

882
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,409
Just a steel town
girl on a Saturday night

883
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,078
Looking for the fight of her life

884
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,455
She has danced into the danger zone

885
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,748
Get in line!

886
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,500
Stretch.

887
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,877
When the dancer becomes the dance

888
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,964
Are you okay?

889
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,551
One, two, three, four, five, six...

890
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,179
On the wire between will and what will be

891
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,809
Whoo! Sweet Jesus.

892
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,230
Charmaine, go.

893
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,397
Uh-uh.

894
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,816
Go!

895
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,778
She's a maniac, maniac...

896
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,154
Slow down.

897
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,406
Watch out!

898
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:10,000
Now I know why they call it The Nutcracker.

899
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,503
I was twirling.

900
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,341
Have you seen this guy?

901
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,425
No.

902
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,303
I'm looking for this Prodi-G. Have you seen him?

903
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,599
I'm a record producer. I'm very
interested in talking to him.

904
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,186
Oh, for realsie? You're standing before his DJ!

905
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,730
Yeah, and, um, I'm his business partner.

906
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,982
You're not his partner.

907
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,483
You're his hype man. Whatever.

908
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,485
Have you seen him?

909
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,404
MIA since Sunday.

910
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,824
The Prodi-G, he's been known
to go on personal retreats

911
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,367
to exorcise his demons.

912
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,703
Let me give you my card.

913
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,830
If you see him, call me.

914
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,957
Maybe we can all do business.

915
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:54,628
Most definitely! Business sounds
good, baby. Take care now.

916
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,715
Let me see that card.

917
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,550
So, tell me once again.

918
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,718
Why do I have to go to art?

919
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,219
Because you're a student here

920
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,138
and you need to keep up your cover.

921
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,431
This ain't even my type of art.

922
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,557
Oh, shut up!

923
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,602
Oh!

924
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,897
You must be our new student, Charmaine.

925
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,106
Hey!

926
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,566
Just in time for figure day.

927
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,985
Oh! Here's our nude model!

928
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,447
Now, you just disrobe whenever you feel comfortable.

929
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,158
Now that's my type of art!

930
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:32,249
Oh, no, no! Ain't nobody getting naked!

931
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,709
That'd be shameful.

932
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:38,589
What on earth do you mean, Big
Momma? This is a fine art class.

933
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,216
We're studying the human form.

934
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,303
Yep. That's right, Big Momma. This is fine art.

935
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,722
And she is mighty fine.

936
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,767
And besides, we're all women here.

937
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,187
Well, of course. I know that.

938
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,733
But what you're doing, you know, with
this woman getting naked...

939
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,569
What you're doing is you're reinforcing

940
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,863
a terrible stereotype.

941
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,658
Yeah, um,

942
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,703
92.6 % of the females in this country

943
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,497
are size 12 or bigger!

944
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,916
Really? Yeah!

945
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,627
What with the media images

946
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,338
telling girls that they won't be happy

947
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,715
unless they're a size negative zero,

948
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,802
well, that just distorts our body image!

949
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,013
And causes eating disorders.

950
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,099
And alopecia.

951
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,558
Oh. Yeah.

952
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,811
And no offense, young lady,

953
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,982
but you got a little body and a big-ass head! Yeah.

954
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,234
The circumference on that thing is like...

955
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,486
Oh, don't listen to her!

956
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,739
She's having hot flashes. Go ahead,
girl, show us what you got!

957
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,574
Wait. No.

958
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,618
You know,

959
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,705
I think I agree with Big Momma.

960
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,164
You do? Yes.

961
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,710
We have never once had a full-figured model.

962
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,670
It's shameful.

963
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,172
Shameful!

964
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,382
So how about it, Big Momma?

965
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,426
Excuse me?

966
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,761
I think you should be our model.

967
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,430
Amen!

968
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,894
Yeah, it's all clear in here.

969
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,896
Pipes are great.

970
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,773
I think you should be our model.

971
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,568
Big Momma don't be getting butt naked for nobody!

972
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,777
Oh, come on. No, I don't get down like that.

973
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,862
You're beautiful!

974
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,114
I know I'm beautiful, but I don't get down like that.

975
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,824
Oh! No.

976
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,890
I need more pastels.

977
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,476
I need a huge canvas.

978
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,897
Excuse me, but shouldn't I be eating some grapes,

979
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,857
or a cheeseburger or something?

980
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,234
You are an inspiration just as you are.

981
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,986
Okay. Class.

982
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,491
It's time for a new pose. Artists, grab a new canvas.

983
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,992
Big Momma?

984
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,078
Oh, okay. Well, um...

985
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,163
How about that one right there?

986
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,664
Very good.

987
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,875
Now, if you'd kindly just drop the sheet.

988
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,002
Say what?

989
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,212
Don't be shy.

990
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:27,841
Like you said, these girls need role models.

991
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,886
Well, I got a lot of rolls, but they're
not exactly the kind...

992
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,764
Oh, come on, Big Momma, let it all hang out!

993
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,350
You don't want it to all hang out!

994
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:39,228
Show us what a real woman looks like!

995
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,606
Hurry up, it's a fire!

996
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,149
Get out of here! It's a fire!

997
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,735
Girl, your hair's gonna crimp up if it catches on fire.

998
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:51,365
Yeah, I'm gonna let the students
and staff know the status.

999
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:56,703
False alarm, ladies! Back to class, back to class!

1000
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,372
Hello,

1001
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,958
Big Momma!

1002
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,045
Wrapped in that sheet, you look like Aphrodite.

1003
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,131
More like the centerfold for Thick and Juicy.

1004
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,717
Kurtis Kool, meet my great-niece, Charmaine.

1005
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:11,885
How you doing, Charmaine?

1006
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,220
A little tip about Big Momma.

1007
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:15,222
The more she resists, the more she wants you.

1008
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,600
With those Beyoncé thighs and the Rihanna eyes!

1009
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,893
Get it?

1010
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,770
Big Momma! Big Momma!

1011
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,232
It's Mia. She's saying she's going to kill herself.

1012
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,484
What you talking? That's terrible!

1013
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,653
I've got to get dressed. Hurry!

1014
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,241
Beautiful thing.

1015
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,119
Boom shaka-laka-laka! Boom shaka-laka!

1016
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:38,954
It's Kurtis. I'm out front.

1017
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:40,539
Charmaine!

1018
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:42,457
Do you have a free period?

1019
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,834
Uh, I do now.

1020
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,085
Good. Come shopping with me.

1021
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,087
Okay. All right.

1022
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,383
All right, all right. I had to get
dressed! What is all this...

1023
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:52,593
Ooh!

1024
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,470
Blood! Did anyone call 911?

1025
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,806
Mia?

1026
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,350
Oh, my God.

1027
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,686
You told me she was going to kill herself.

1028
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:03,979
I want to die!

1029
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,647
You have too much to live for.

1030
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,900
Calm down. Tell Big Momma what happened.

1031
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,861
We bought hair dye at Walgreens

1032
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,030
and the directions were in Spanish.

1033
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,531
She takes French.

1034
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:18,035
Child, don't you know cheap
hair dye is like an old man?

1035
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,662
It don't last long and it marks up the furniture.

1036
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,039
I thought if I looked different,

1037
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,291
Delanté would fall back in love with me.

1038
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,001
You look different, all right.

1039
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,669
But now, listen.

1040
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,589
He has got to love you for all the
stuff you can't buy in no store.

1041
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,007
And if he don't,

1042
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:35,135
then don't change yourself, change your man.

1043
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,429
Huh? We feeling the deepness?

1044
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,473
Huh? Think about that.

1045
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,770
What about my hair?

1046
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,480
Oh, well, that's got to go.

1047
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,607
Yeah, we're gonna wash that
fella right out of your hair.

1048
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,948
Ew, not that.

1049
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,950
Definitely not that!

1050
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,661
This. Mmm-mmm.

1051
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,871
I'm not sure that's me. You know?

1052
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,123
I know what's you. Trust me.

1053
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,425
Oh, girl, you want this one?

1054
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,511
What do you mean? We're sharing.

1055
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,563
What are you waiting for? Take your clothes off.

1056
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,316
Oh.

1057
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,741
Uh, girl, something just came up! I'll be right back.

1058
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,576
I'll be right back!

1059
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,454
Are you okay?

1060
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,206
Uh, I'm all right!

1061
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,296
Wake up in the morning
feeling like P. Diddy

1062
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:57,217
Grab my glasses, I'm out the
door I'm gonna hit this city

1063
00:59:57,301 --> 01:00:01,430
Before I leave Brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack

1064
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:05,267
'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't coming back

1065
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,186
I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes

1066
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,188
Trying on all our clothes, clothes

1067
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,025
Boys blowing up our phones, phones

1068
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,194
Drop-topping Playing our favorite CDs

1069
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,196
Pulling up to the parties

1070
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,491
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

1071
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:25,495
Don't stop, make it pop DJ, blow my speakers up

Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh

01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,678
You've been Momma-fied.

1111
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,980
What... Is it not me? Is it too much?

1112
01:02:57,064 --> 01:03:00,817
Oh, don't be silly. You just need the final touch.

1113
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:04,988
Get her a chair. Yeah, okay. Grab a seat. I'll get it.

1114
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,869
Oh!

1115
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,245
There we go.

1116
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:13,997
Vaseline?

1117
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,874
God's gift to black people.

1118
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:20,420
Ashy coming out of the bathtub?
Baby's got a diaper rash?

1119
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:22,589
Your hair look like it just took a mug shot?

1120
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,132
Just rub it in!

1121
01:03:24,508 --> 01:03:27,469
There. Watch me work my magic now.

1122
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,305
Voilà!

1123
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,021
There you go.

1124
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,732
You're a genius! Thank you!

1125
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,985
I just brought the beauty outside.

1126
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,529
Um...

1127
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:51,576
Come over here for a second and let
Big Momma get a talk with you.

1128
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,455
Tell me what you know about the missing music box.

1129
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,627
You didn't hear this from me, but Jasmine and Isabelle,

1130
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,464
I heard them say they're meeting
someone near the library tonight.

1131
01:04:04,548 --> 01:04:05,548
With what?

1132
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,716
I don't know.

1133
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,679
But I heard them say that Isabelle's
gonna bring it in her bag.

1134
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,108
You look awesome, girl.

1135
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,276
Oh!

1136
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:26,778
Back at you, H-bomb.

1137
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:29,739
Yo, Robinson.

1138
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:31,783
Delanté.

1139
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,660
Looking fine today, Haley. Yes, she is.

1140
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,203
How about we hang out after your big show?

1141
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,663
You just broke up with Mia.

1142
01:04:36,872 --> 01:04:38,456
Help me heal.

1143
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,626
Come on.

1144
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,129
IM me if you change your mind.

1145
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,966
Ugh! Those guys are such tools.

1146
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,175
Right?

1147
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,554
So, you got, like, a boyfriend or anything?

1148
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,097
No way.

1149
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:58,268
I'm beginning to think the guy I'm
looking for doesn't really exist.

1150
01:04:58,352 --> 01:04:59,602
How about you?

1151
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,146
Oh, no, girl.

1152
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,773
The guy for me definitely does not exist.

1153
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:08,278
You know what? I think I got somebody
I could hook you up with, girl.

1154
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,738
Really? Yep.

1155
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,364
Who? He's my cousin.

1156
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:14,951
His name is Trent. Hottie. Buff. Right?

1157
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,455
He's our age. Plus, he's like a hip-hop lyrical miracle.

1158
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,248
You've probably seen him perform at the Promenade.

1159
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,458
He goes by the name of...

1160
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,251
The Prodi-G? Yeah, yeah!

1161
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,544
Yeah, yeah!

1162
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:26,212
Thinks he's all that and then some?

1163
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,839
Talks about himself in the third person

1164
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:31,217
and thinks that every girl on the planet is after him?

1165
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,303
No offense, Charmaine,

1166
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,930
but your cousin is the last kind
of guy I'd ever hook up with.

1167
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,019
Ew, the Prodi-G.

1168
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,025
So, uh,

1169
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,195
what is your type?

1170
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:52,322
He's artistic.

1171
01:05:52,656 --> 01:05:56,117
Sensitive. Interested in people besides himself.

1172
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,996
And he likes long,

1173
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,041
sweet, slow, lingering kisses.

1174
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,252
Damn.

1175
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,171
Damn!

1176
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:10,590
What? Are you making fun of me?

1177
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:14,260
Oh, no, girl. No, I'm saying that's exactly Trent.

1178
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,305
Sure, he can be all puffed up on the outside,

1179
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,473
but once you get to know him,

1180
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,891
I'm saying, he's a real sweetheart.

1181
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:23,436
I mean, you guys should, like, be a couple!

1182
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,397
He was thinking about going
to the Showcase tomorrow.

1183
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,774
Maybe you guys can hook up,
you know, after the dance.

1184
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,442
Tomorrow night.

1185
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,111
I don't know. Can I meet him before?

1186
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:33,905
No! It's tomorrow night.

1187
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,075
Well, how about tonight, then?

1188
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,620
Oh, he'll be there.

1189
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,414
Good.

1190
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,920
Just Kurtis Kool.

1191
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:50,797
Let me see.

1192
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,757
What is wrong with you? Your life's in danger

1193
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,426
and what did you do? You go shopping.

1194
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:57,011
Look, shopping is a very big deal for girls.

1195
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,098
It's like their sports. If they ain't
doing it, they're talking about it.

1196
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,517
Comparing stats, tracking sales.

1197
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:03,810
It's like a fantasy league, you know?

1198
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,688
So help me, Trent, if you're
falling for that Haley girl...

1199
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:09,315
I'm not going for Haley. I mean... No.

1200
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,608
She's not my type.

1201
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,776
Good.

1202
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,491
Okay, so, why don't we just go
down there and intercept it?

1203
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:21,202
Not yet. Surveillance is a waiting game.

1204
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,371
We can't do anything that could blow our cover.

1205
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,540
Besides, if Mia is spinning us,

1206
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,834
let's just hope that if it is the music box,

1207
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,919
that the flash drive's still inside it.

1208
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,629
Oh, okay.

1209
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,967
So we just wait here.

1210
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,018
Wait a minute. Is that the Tempts?

1211
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:47,562
Not too old school for you?

1212
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,148
No, actually, I was thinking about
sampling it for my mix tape.

1213
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:51,941
Can you sing it?

1214
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,068
I'd rather hum.

1215
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:58,156
I mean, but if you sing it, I can catch a
vibe and I can have a dope mix tape

1216
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,409
with some old-school jams on
there. Then we can like...

1217
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,994
All right.

1218
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,164
Papa was a rolling stone

1219
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,709
Wherever he laid his hat was his home

1220
01:08:09,793 --> 01:08:10,793
What

1221
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:14,589
And I'm so fly But I get it from my fam

1222
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,591
And we in the place and we on a case

1223
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,010
Vibin' out to an old-school jam

1224
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,429
I like that.

1225
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,224
I like how you put the little new
school with the old school.

1226
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,017
I could feel that.

1227
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:29,604
I could jam to that. I could, you
know, do this little thing I do.

1228
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,189
Now, what's that?

1229
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,358
A little something I used to do back in the day

1230
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,442
called the Cleveland Shuffle.

1231
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,277
Oh, no, I need that. Come on.

1232
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,487
Well, it's two to the right.

1233
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:38,613
Okay.

1234
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:41,241
Two to the left. Now freak with it.

1235
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:44,702
Freak with it. Freak with it, freak with it.

1236
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:48,039
Kick. Now you get your spin on. Right?

1237
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:49,958
Right? Bring it back.

1238
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,085
Then you freak with it.

1239
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:54,045
Freak with it. That's right.

1240
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:56,798
And your arms got to be in a little T. rex position.

1241
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,633
Okay. So a little something...

1242
01:08:58,717 --> 01:08:59,801
Now freak with it.

1243
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,302
So it's like the Soulja Boy, right?

1244
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:04,681
No, Soulja Boy, that's a little hop thing.

1245
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,683
I know what you're talking about,
but that's a little hop thing.

1246
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,434
This is... This is more like this?

1247
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,687
This is Tempts. When them boys was...

1248
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,480
I like that. You know, "Oooh!"

1249
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,065
You know, that kind of thing.

1250
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:16,484
That's why I like doing this move.

1251
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,903
'Cause it's not that complicated.

1252
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,535
Wait, what's up?

1253
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,288
There are the girls. All right.

1254
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:31,040
Chirkoff must have gotten to Kurtis Kool

1255
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,251
and Kurtis Kool got the girls to steal the music box.

1256
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,627
I can't believe that.

1257
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,672
Look, Trent. Get back in that dress, all right?

1258
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,840
I'm gonna check it out.

1259
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:39,966
Okay.

1260
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,110
All right

1261
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,367
Come on You're outta sight

1262
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,164
You got to give me just what I need

1263
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:15,627
And a sweet little something that
brings a man to his knees

1264
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:19,464
I like it easy I like it nice and slow

1265
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,090
Boo. Oh!

1266
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,054
Wow, a security guard with stalkers.

1267
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,473
I'm a curious woman.

1268
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,643
Why don't you come and throw
back some juice with me?

1269
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,811
Let me satisfy that curiosity.

1270
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,026
Well, all right. A little juice.

1271
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,278
This way? Mmm-hmm.

1272
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:56,334
I know, lately

1273
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,002
Hey, have you seen a girl...

1274
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,962
Oh, okay. Thank you.

1275
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,516
Haley?

1276
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:14,352
Trent?

1277
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,688
What's up? How you doing?

1278
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:23,236
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late. These poetry
readings always run long.

1279
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:26,739
You do spoken word?

1280
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:28,074
Yeah.

1281
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:32,954
And I like slow, lingering kisses.

1282
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,124
You know, it's weird that you would say that.

1283
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,918
Yeah, 'cause you feel the same way, too, right?

1284
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,838
No, it's just weird that you would say that.

1285
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:50,138
Right, right. Because rap don't allow
me to get my sensitivities out.

1286
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,391
And I got a lot of sensitivities

1287
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,644
I like to get out. As a man, it's like...

1288
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:59,355
They're deep. It's like an ocean inside me.

1289
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:02,316
At the poetry jam, uh,

1290
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,485
we get all our sensitivities out,
you know what I'm saying?

1291
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,320
And we be snapping...

1292
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,613
Okay.

1293
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:10,408
And it's like... It's, uh...

1294
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,161
You know, I'm really sorry all Charmaine's
coaching had to go to waste,

1295
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,495
but I think that I'm just going to go.

1296
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,664
No, no, no, wait, just stay. Stay.

1297
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,416
Look.

1298
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:22,170
Charmaine told me you were a beautiful, great girl.

1299
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:25,840
And usually, beautiful, great girls don't go for...

1300
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,091
The Prodi-G?

1301
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:30,595
Yeah. Well, that's not exactly who I am.

1302
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,432
This isn't who I am. This is...

1303
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:40,980
Okay, then, who are you?

1304
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,194
I don't know. I don't know who I am.

1305
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:48,654
I'm still trying to figure that out.

1306
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:51,991
Me, too.

1307
01:12:52,367 --> 01:12:54,452
Yeah. Can we run this back?

1308
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,454
Yes. Yes, we can.

1309
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:58,039
I'm Trent.

1310
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,333
Haley. Haley.

1311
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:06,798
Your champagne, my Nubian goddess.

1312
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:11,093
Now don't go putting me on no pedestal.
You know it might break.

1313
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:14,722
What you talking about, girl?
I like a woman with a little

1314
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,641
funk in her trunk!

1315
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:21,145
And some shrimp in the backyard. That's a woman!

1316
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,023
Well, you know I like me
a man with a dangerous side.

1317
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,902
Something tells me that Kurtis Kool is not just a man

1318
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,612
with keys and a Taser, huh?

1319
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:32,657
And you're ticklish!

1320
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:39,163
Well, I'm into some illegalities at the moment.

1321
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,915
Oh? Well, what kind?

1322
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:44,001
Well, just typical BS, you know.

1323
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:46,754
Middleman stuff.

1324
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:49,799
Holding something hot.

1325
01:13:51,134 --> 01:13:52,635
That's "stolen."

1326
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,596
Who you holding it for?

1327
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:58,140
What are you, the FBI?

1328
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:01,185
No! Ain't no FBI!

1329
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:03,104
You wearing a wire?

1330
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:04,438
What? No!

1331
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:05,690
I'm going to find the wire!

1332
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,775
Can you hear this? No...

1333
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,071
Now that's funny, 'cause I know I ain't no FBI.

1334
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:13,614
This I know.

1335
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,869
Oh.

1336
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,872
You're so beautiful.

1337
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,583
So much I like you.

1338
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,251
You know,

1339
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:29,755
you're my high priestess of delight.

1340
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,258
No, no... Kurtis Kool!

1341
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:34,218
I just want to bite you! Kurtis!

1342
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,805
You got

1343
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,683
Motownopoly. Let's play.

1344
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,727
Yeah.

1345
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,812
I got a better game than that.

1346
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:55,448
So, look, I should get back.

1347
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,117
Really? Why?

1348
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,412
I guess I got a little time.

1349
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,623
Damn! Damn!

1350
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,876
Yo! It's Trent!

1351
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,420
Yo, you got the producer guy's number?

1352
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:11,339
Yo, call him and tell him we found our boy.

1353
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:12,882
What's he doing?

1354
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:18,137
Yeah. Yeah, we found our boy!

1355
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:29,607
Trent! Yo!

1356
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:34,278
Whoa! Rembrandt. Wow.

1357
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,031
Yeah. This is my crew.

1358
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:38,532
This is Rembrandt and Scratch.

1359
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,659
Hey.

1360
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,160
How you doing? How you doing?

1361
01:15:41,244 --> 01:15:43,287
Yo, you got your step-pop to sign the contract yet?

1362
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,872
Yeah, man, I'm on it.

1363
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,290
Come on, I want to take you somewhere.

1364
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,042
Okay.

1365
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:50,086
See you guys later. See you guys.

1366
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,170
All right.

1367
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:52,380
Yeah, you do that!

1368
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,298
'Cause we got somebody we want you to meet.

1369
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,133
Yeah, I'll holler. Okay.

1370
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,718
Yeah, yeah! Tomorrow, Trent!

1371
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,555
Scratch and Rembrandt, they're like,
I don't know, one's tall, one's short.

1372
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,516
Yeah, I noticed that.

1373
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:06,519
We found him.

1374
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:09,981
Just stay with him. See
if he leads you to the father.

1375
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,232
Okay.

1376
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,490
Let the games begin.

1377
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,995
You know, these girls of mine are driving me up a wall.

1378
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:26,580
You know Jasmine Lee and Isabelle Parada?

1379
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,000
No, refresh my memory.

1380
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:30,835
Left foot, red.

1381
01:16:34,589 --> 01:16:36,966
They gave you a bag about an hour ago.

1382
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,302
Right foot, yellow.

1383
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:47,101
Oh! That Jasmine and Isabelle.

1384
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,979
Sorry, Big Momma.

1385
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:54,316
You know, those girls could be in a
lot of trouble. And so could you.

1386
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,902
So who you holding that bag for?

1387
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,113
Someone outside the school?

1388
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,365
You really want to see that bag?

1389
01:17:02,617 --> 01:17:03,743
Damn!

1390
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:07,121
Right hand, blue.

1391
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,081
Are you...

1392
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,292
Is it blue?

1393
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,419
Mmm-hmm. Right hand, blue.

1394
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,135
Come to papa.

1395
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,072
Left hand, green!

1396
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,699
Oh, well...

1397
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,827
Looks like we're all out of green. Game over.

1398
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,039
No, no, no. I got your green.

1399
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,670
Okay. Go ahead. Reach for the stars, baby.

1400
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,130
Oh, hell, no!

1401
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,466
What's wrong with your voice?

1402
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,260
You heard me. Get your ass up.

1403
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:07,598
Sister, you a brother?

1404
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:11,811
Not again.

1405
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,814
You touch me again, I'll knock you into next Sunday.

1406
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:18,025
Hand over the bag. Hand over the bag, now!

1407
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:23,531
Every time I try to meet somebody,
it's ding-a-ling-a-ling!

1408
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,116
Be quiet! All right?

1409
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:28,702
I'm undercover. FBI. Now give me the damn bag.

1410
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,830
Wow.

1411
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:40,673
What the hell?

1412
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,309
What the hell is a grown man
doing with a damn rooster?

1413
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:55,146
The girls stole it from St. Ignatius.

1414
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:57,731
The boys' school? They're the Gamecocks.

1415
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:00,151
They were gonna give it back after the Showcase.

1416
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,448
You want to finish the game?

1417
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:10,744
Come on.

1418
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,996
Where are we going?

1419
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,664
You'll see. Okay.

1420
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,216
Wow.

1421
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:26,760
It's my home away from home.

1422
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,470
This is nice.

1423
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:29,597
Tomorrow night's the Showcase

1424
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,183
and it's my best shot at getting
a scholarship for composition.

1425
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:34,685
Without a scholarship, I'm out.

1426
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,563
Everyone is gonna be there, you know?

1427
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,024
Juilliard, Berklee, Peabody and Oberlin.

1428
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:43,235
All right, look. Okay. So, I see
a beautiful woman right now.

1429
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,112
I see a dope piano.

1430
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,615
And nobody's playing it.

1431
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,201
You want me to play?

1432
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,369
Yeah.

1433
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,454
Right now.

1434
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,539
All right, I guess I gotta play it.

1435
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,875
No, no, don't touch my piano.

1436
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,086
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1437
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:08,093
Okay, please don't judge. It's rough.

1438
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,359
See? It's not totally there yet.

1439
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:24,735
I don't know, something's missing.

1440
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:27,112
No, it's not missing nothing. It's tight.

1441
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,573
You just got to feel it, you know what I mean?

1442
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,451
You got to, like, speed it up a little bit.

1443
01:20:32,535 --> 01:20:33,994
Speed it up? Yeah.

1444
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,121
Okay, um...

1445
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:41,085
Yeah. Yeah.

1446
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,920
That's better, right? Yeah.

1447
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:57,726
You've given me everything

1448
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,813
You make me complete

1449
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,075
Yeah, I like that, I like that.

1450
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:14,201
You like that?

1451
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,995
Should we syncopate it?

1452
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,957
Look, normally, I don't syncopate
on the first date, but...

1453
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,889
All right, this is what we're gonna do next, right?

1454
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,100
You're gonna go up a little higher.
You know what I mean?

1455
01:21:38,184 --> 01:21:39,935
Up an octave?

1456
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,687
Yeah, an octave.

1457
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,203
Baby, you know

1458
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:02,082
You are the air that I breathe

1459
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,210
The life that's in me

1460
01:22:09,215 --> 01:22:12,009
Me and you, we chillin' Hangin', cruisin'

1461
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,429
Me and you together ain't worth losin'

1462
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:18,265
On the keys, being crazy

1463
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,768
Happy that I get to see you daily

1464
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:23,270
Each time I see you

1465
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:26,231
My heart starts to pound

1466
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:31,820
Whenever you come around

1467
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:36,367
'Cause you are all I need

1468
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:41,538
You've given me everything

1469
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,249
You make me complete

1470
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:49,254
Yeah, you are all I need

1471
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,884
You're making me better, see

1472
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:58,555
All of the love that you're giving me

1473
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,272
How did you... That song is amazing.

1474
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:08,399
It's perfect, right?

1475
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:11,068
We have to do it at the Showcase tomorrow night.

1476
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:12,319
We?

1477
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,738
Yeah, we'll blow everyone away!

1478
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:17,658
I mean, you know, it's your show. I'll be watching.

1479
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:21,620
No, come on, you're a part of
this. I can't do it without you.

1480
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:23,747
Please?

1481
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:26,333
What time? Really?

1482
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,253
Thank you!

1483
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:40,264
I have to go back to the dorms before I get in trouble.

1484
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:41,682
Yo.

1485
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,435
Let's break night.

1486
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:47,604
"Break night." Yeah.

1487
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,106
I love that.

1488
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,108
You're so amazing with words.

1489
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:53,277
I can't believe you don't want to go to college.

1490
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:56,738
I mean, all of those writers and poets you could study.

1491
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,950
You know, I just figured I got
to strike while the iron's hot.

1492
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,120
Jay-Z didn't drop Reasonable Doubt until he was 27.

1493
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:07,875
Said the world's in a rush, but he waited to be perfect.

1494
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:10,961
Hmm.

1495
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:12,463
Well,

1496
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,466
I'm feeling pretty perfect right now.

1497
01:24:18,094 --> 01:24:19,303
Me, too.

1498
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:39,323
I have curfew.

1499
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,034
See you tomorrow night?

1500
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:43,118
Yeah.

1501
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,996
Yeah, tomorrow night!

1502
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:59,092
Kid's here to see his girlfriend, not his father.

1503
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:02,012
Then take him. We'll kill him later.

1504
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:03,764
Right now, he's bait.

1505
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:05,682
Okay.

1506
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,018
Let's go get him.

1507
01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:14,608
Let's go. Come on.

1508
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:30,290
Two girls in one night.

1509
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,000
You got to give the kid credit.

1510
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,132
Not so much.

1511
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:56,900
You idiots! How could you lose him?

1512
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:02,322
I don't know. But I know where to find his girlfriend.

1513
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:03,991
Both of them.

1514
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,250
Here's the deal.

1515
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,961
You want me to keep your secret

1516
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:19,715
about kidnapping Foghorn Leghorn here,

1517
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:24,428
then tell me what you know about the
music box missing from the library.

1518
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:29,016
Okay. That a girl.

1519
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:33,937
There's a music box in the library and now it's missing.

1520
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:38,942
Big Momma, I have been looking for...

1521
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:44,448
What is the St. Ignatius mascot doing here?

1522
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:51,163
Okay, I'm going to give you to the count of three.

1523
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:55,083
And if nobody speaks up, then neither
of you is going to the Showcase.

1524
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:57,586
One.

1525
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:00,797
Two.

1526
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,801
They didn't steal the bird!

1527
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:07,095
Uh, they found it.

1528
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:11,266
Yeah, it was wandering around the
quad and they brought it to me.

1529
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:15,771
Oh. Well...

1530
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:17,939
Thank you, girls.

1531
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,567
There go one of my flock in need of some counseling.

1532
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:23,904
Listen. I suggest you get this bird back to St. Ignatius

1533
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:25,822
before it lays any more eggs.

1534
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:27,824
But it's a rooster.

1535
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,743
Child, they all taste the same

1536
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:31,828
when you preheat the oven to 350.

1537
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,330
Try it!

1538
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,297
You!

1539
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,757
Stop!

1540
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:48,178
Come here! Come here!

1541
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:51,890
Come here!

1542
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:56,144
I know that I've left you
a couple of other voice mails.

1543
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:57,854
You can ignore those.

1544
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,316
I can call you back.

1545
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:02,484
Drive!

1546
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:05,237
I can't! Delanté used to drive me
everywhere! I barely know...

1547
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:07,864
Child, I told you, you don't need
no damn Delanté! Now, drive!

1548
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,082
Turn!

1549
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:21,795
I almost hit him!

1550
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:23,004
Almost don't count.

1551
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:31,930
Now take it up to 80.

1552
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:33,223
Eighty?

1553
01:28:33,307 --> 01:28:34,391
You heard me! Eighty!

1554
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:40,605
Great. I'm being followed by a
fat lady in a driver's ed car!

1555
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:41,732
She's catching up.

1556
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,030
Turn here!

1557
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:57,622
There! I'm going to pull the emergency brake.

1558
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:07,215
This little go-kart handles well.

1559
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:08,759
Keep driving! Go!

1560
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:10,844
Now don't slow down.

1561
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:12,596
You're going to kill us!

1562
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,473
Without Delanté, you got nothing to live for.

1563
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:17,184
No, I do! I have friends and I have school...

1564
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,315
That was amazing!

1565
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:25,358
Watch out!

1566
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:26,860
What do we do now?

1567
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:28,153
Pray for the airbags.

1568
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:29,488
I can do this!

1569
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:45,003
Well, I think you learned enough for one day. I'll drive.

1570
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,089
Oh, my gosh, there they are!

1571
01:29:51,385 --> 01:29:53,178
Have you lost your mind?

1572
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,598
They're driving backwards.

1573
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:04,439
Oh, God!

1574
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:11,404
This is making me nauseous.

1575
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:33,510
Wow, that was fun! Let's do it again.

1576
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:37,138
They were here. I gotta
believe they're coming back.

1577
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:39,015
They're going to kill me.

1578
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:41,268
You've never taken off that dress.

1579
01:30:41,352 --> 01:30:42,519
How would they know you were here?

1580
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:46,356
They wouldn't. But if they did.

1581
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,944
Trent, is there something you want to tell me?

1582
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:55,115
No.

1583
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:57,284
Now, listen. Get back in costume.

1584
01:30:57,368 --> 01:31:00,078
Do not get out of it under any circumstances.

1585
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:01,788
All right? All right.

1586
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,627
Hey. Don't worry.

1587
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:10,505
I'll find it when everyone's at the Showcase tonight.

1588
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:13,717
Okay? All right.

1589
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:20,056
You guys have to see.

1590
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:25,729
Isabelle, it's great. You really captured her.

1591
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:28,398
Yeah, girl, and there's a whole lot to capture.

1592
01:31:28,482 --> 01:31:31,610
Thanks. I just hope the RISD admissions people agree.

1593
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:33,069
Yeah, they totally will.

1594
01:31:33,487 --> 01:31:36,656
Hey, have you heard from Trent?
He better be here soon.

1595
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:42,996
Big Momma?

1596
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:44,664
Yes, dear?

1597
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:49,878
You knew I took the rooster
and you didn't narc me out.

1598
01:31:50,379 --> 01:31:53,590
Child, this is not Big Momma's first barbecue.

1599
01:31:53,924 --> 01:31:56,384
You putting on this front of toughness.

1600
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,428
Trying to act all growed up.

1601
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:00,347
I'm a senior.

1602
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:02,807
Child, I see who you are on the inside.

1603
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:06,227
You're a good, sensitive girl. No
different than Big Momma.

1604
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:08,355
You're strong-willed,

1605
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:11,566
just trying to take care of the
people who depend on you.

1606
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:14,069
Plus

1607
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:16,946
I'm starving!

1608
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:20,450
Aw! The poor baby is hungry!

1609
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:26,790
I did something else.

1610
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,417
Worse than the rooster.

1611
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:31,002
She wanted to be a Diva so bad,

1612
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:33,880
I told her she could be if she stole the music box.

1613
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:35,256
Who?

1614
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:37,050
Haley. I made her do it.

1615
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,678
I told her to bring it tonight so
that we could put it back.

1616
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:41,054
Where is Haley?

1617
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:42,972
I just saw her with Mia.

1618
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:48,144
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to our annual Showcase!

1619
01:32:50,272 --> 01:32:52,649
Get ready to see some of the best

1620
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,818
and brightest young talent that Atlanta has to offer.

1621
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:57,070
Well, thank you for telling me, all right?

1622
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:59,030
That was big of you, you know?

1623
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:02,492
Now you get out there and break a
leg, and make Big Momma proud.

1624
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:06,913
And afterward, I'm going to
have a double cheeseburger

1625
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:09,582
and a regular Coke.

1626
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:11,292
Supersize it!

1627
01:33:12,628 --> 01:33:13,670
...Jasmine Lee!

1628
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,338
Now go, go! Go, go, go!

1629
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:30,603
How many times do I gotta say I'm sorry?

1630
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,188
Sorry?

1631
01:33:33,357 --> 01:33:36,609
"Sorry" don't mean squat from a two-timing dog!

1632
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:38,778
Like Aunt Yorima used to say,

1633
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:42,490
"It's better to be alone with yourself
for the rest of your life

1634
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:44,993
"than together with bad company for a minute."

1635
01:33:45,077 --> 01:33:47,328
And, honey, you is bad company!

1636
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:51,040
You're an entire conglomerate of badness!

1637
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,418
Wait. Who is Aunt Yorima?

1638
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:56,254
Mia? You seen Haley?

1639
01:33:56,338 --> 01:33:57,714
Yeah. I think she's with Charmaine.

1640
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:00,216
Try the other side of the stage.

1641
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:02,844
This Delanté? Yeah.

1642
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:07,640
And another thing...

1643
01:34:11,228 --> 01:34:13,188
Hey, Haley. Hey, girl.

1644
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:15,190
Where is Trent? I'm up next!

1645
01:34:15,274 --> 01:34:16,775
Excuse me.

1646
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:21,946
Listen, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

1647
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:25,700
Trent's not going to make it.

1648
01:34:26,952 --> 01:34:28,995
What? What am I going to do?

1649
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,588
Bravo! You did your thing. I saw that move.

1650
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:42,634
All right, listen. Breathe, girl, breathe. It's all good.

1651
01:34:42,718 --> 01:34:44,844
You're going to go out there
and you're gonna be great.

1652
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:46,137
You don't need Trent.

1653
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:50,016
Next, with an original composition, Haley Robinson!

1654
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:51,851
Okay.

1655
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:02,403
Big Momma, what are you doing?

1656
01:35:02,488 --> 01:35:03,905
You're supposed to be chaperoning!

1657
01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:05,198
There are boys backstage.

1658
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:10,036
All right, all right.

1659
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:11,955
Hey! What are you... Get out of there, you!

1660
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:15,542
You don't try to get a little nookie!
I'm gonna tan your hide!

1661
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:20,255
Okay.

1662
01:35:39,108 --> 01:35:40,400
Um...

1663
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:47,824
I'm sorry, this was supposed to be a duet.

1664
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:56,374
It still is, girl. Look, Trent taught me everything.

1665
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:58,209
What? Rock with it.

1666
01:36:12,057 --> 01:36:14,475
Baby, you know

1667
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:18,104
You are the air that I breathe

1668
01:36:18,397 --> 01:36:20,940
The life that's in me

1669
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:23,318
Oh

1670
01:36:24,486 --> 01:36:27,280
And each time I see you

1671
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:30,116
My heart starts to pound

1672
01:36:30,492 --> 01:36:35,622
Whenever you come around

1673
01:36:36,206 --> 01:36:40,752
'Cause you are all I need

1674
01:36:42,796 --> 01:36:45,548
You're making me better, see

1675
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,508
From all of the love

1676
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,385
That you're giving me Every time I think about you

1677
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,721
Want you, need you, hold you, kiss you, love you

1678
01:36:51,805 --> 01:36:54,807
Never would place a person on this earth above you

1679
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:58,728
I just want to be the one to make you feel amazing

1680
01:36:58,812 --> 01:37:00,980

Whenever you come around

1684
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:16,579
Yeah, you are all I need

1685
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,414
Uh, you gentlemen...

1686
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:20,291
Are you invited guests?

1687
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:23,002
That's the crazy lady who chased us.

1688
01:37:23,253 --> 01:37:25,421
Get out of our way. We have business here.

1689
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:27,423
Only business you have here is none-ya.

1690
01:37:28,258 --> 01:37:29,842
What? "None-ya"?

1691
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:32,553
None-ya damn business!

1692
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:35,556
I crossed the line I'm wrong to lie

1693
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:37,016
I'll make you mine

1694
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:41,354
Yeah, you are all I need

1695
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:43,147
Wait

1696
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:45,984
These words I'm speaking
got me going crazy

1697
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:47,610
I need you, Haley

1698
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,570
To be my baby

1699
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:02,625
Wardrobe malfunction!

1700
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,009
Haley... You... You're...

1701
01:38:11,093 --> 01:38:12,385
Let me explain. I trusted you!

1702
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:13,511
No, listen, listen.

1703
01:38:13,595 --> 01:38:15,596
My God, everything I told you?

1704
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:17,223
I'm just saying... Listen.

1705
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:23,896
Haley!

1706
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:29,152
Security! Security! He groped me!

1707
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:31,988
He's trying to freak me!

1708
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:35,408
He's groping me! He's trying to freak me!

1709
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:37,744
Oh, Lord!

1710
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:41,080
Call the FBI, ask for Agent Crawford.

1711
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:42,498
Tell him you're a friend of Big Momma's

1712
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,542
and keep everyone in the auditorium!

1713
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:45,668
I don't understand.

1714
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,129
Just do
it. I'll explain it to you later.

1715
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:54,302
Okay. Everyone, please stay in your seats, okay?

1716
01:38:54,386 --> 01:38:56,471
Mrs. Mercier, dancers, please!

1717
01:39:00,642 --> 01:39:02,101
Split up!

1718
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,270
Haley!

1719
01:39:04,354 --> 01:39:05,772
Trent! Trent!

1720
01:39:07,691 --> 01:39:08,733
Haley!

1721
01:39:08,817 --> 01:39:10,359
Yo, yo, yo! What is this thing?

1722
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:12,820
Dude, you are all kinds of freaky!

1723
01:39:12,905 --> 01:39:14,614
Does Haley like you better as a girl or a boy?

1724
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:16,115
Look, I can't do this right now.

1725
01:39:16,366 --> 01:39:18,367
Big boy! Come on, man!

1726
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:20,620
Come on, get him! Get him!

1727
01:39:21,663 --> 01:39:24,957
All right. Y'all got 30
seconds to get your asses off campus

1728
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:27,293
or there's a hell of a lot more where that came from.

1729
01:39:27,544 --> 01:39:29,045
Bounce!

1730
01:39:29,963 --> 01:39:31,464
You've got some explaining to do.

1731
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:33,549
Look, Chirkoff's guys must've
made me yesterday in town.

1732
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,510
I took off Charmaine's outfit just once,

1733
01:39:35,594 --> 01:39:36,719
to get close to Haley.

1734
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:39,388
You blew your cover. And you lied to me about it!

1735
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:40,556
For a girl who played you?

1736
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:41,724
She didn't play me.

1737
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,560
Oh, yeah? Did she tell you she had the music box?

1738
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:48,689
You act like you're the man.

1739
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:50,566
And you were starting to convince me.

1740
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:52,068
But it's all an act, you know why?

1741
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:54,821
'Cause a real man wouldn't risk his life for some girl.

1742
01:39:55,197 --> 01:39:57,073
Look, she ain't just some girl!

1743
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:58,866
You did the same thing when you met my mom.

1744
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:00,701
This is nothing like that.

1745
01:40:00,786 --> 01:40:02,578
Come on. Come on. Malcolm!

1746
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,080
In. In! Yo!

1747
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:09,877
Stay there! Do not move.

1748
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:12,964
Look, you got to trust me! Malcolm!

1749
01:40:14,216 --> 01:40:15,675
Damn!

1750
01:40:39,032 --> 01:40:41,534
Haley! Haley!

1751
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:49,876
Haley!

1752
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,547
Boss. We got him.

1753
01:41:01,096 --> 01:41:02,471
H-bomb!

1754
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:04,098
Go away! Look, let me explain.

1755
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:05,725
Leave me alone!

1756
01:41:05,809 --> 01:41:08,728
Look, you got the music box in that bag, don't you?

1757
01:41:08,812 --> 01:41:10,980
Yeah, and right now I just want to
put it away and get out of here,

1758
01:41:11,064 --> 01:41:12,899
seeing as how my life is pretty much ruined!

1759
01:41:12,983 --> 01:41:15,318
Look, there's some crazy, dangerous people after that.

1760
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,570
What are you talking about? It's
just some old music box.

1761
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:19,322
Not really.

1762
01:41:25,537 --> 01:41:29,665
Look. This flash drive got evidence that'd
put away some really bad people.

1763
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,167
That's why I've been working undercover.

1764
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:33,544
What?

1765
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:36,797
So this was just some kind of job?

1766
01:41:41,511 --> 01:41:43,137
Our night together? Our kiss?

1767
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:45,723
We'll talk about that later. But right now, I need this.

1768
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,433
There's no later. Haley.

1769
01:41:47,517 --> 01:41:49,602
Actually, I'll take the drive!

1770
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:52,897
Trent!

1771
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:55,441
Haley, come on!

1772
01:41:58,612 --> 01:41:59,987
Run, run!

1773
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:03,282
Talk to me.

1774
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:05,076
The kid's with the girl, they're in the library.

1775
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:06,619
Haley, we got to get you somewhere safe.

1776
01:42:06,703 --> 01:42:08,621
Let go of me! Come on.

1777
01:42:14,169 --> 01:42:15,670
Don't move.

1778
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,673
Runs pretty good for a woman.

1779
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:20,800
Oh, don't shoot.

1780
01:42:20,884 --> 01:42:24,845
I'm not even wearing a clean pair of granny panties.

1781
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:28,015
Coroner's gonna think I'm some two-bit floozy!

1782
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,350
Shut up.

1783
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:36,232
My palpitations!

1784
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:37,942
My poor cholesterol heart!

1785
01:42:38,026 --> 01:42:41,320
Like Fred Sanford said, "I'm coming
to join you, Elizabeth!"

1786
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:50,496
Wait, wait, wait!

1787
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,248
Come on. Come on!

1788
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:07,513
This way.

1789
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:13,602
Big Momma! Catch!

1790
01:43:15,897 --> 01:43:17,356
Move. Move!

1791
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:18,774
Haley, it's gonna be okay.

1792
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:19,984
Shut your mouth!

1793
01:43:20,819 --> 01:43:23,070
You just gonna hurt these innocent children?

1794
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,447
Give me the flash drive.

1795
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:25,781
What if I say no?

1796
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,575
I'm pretty good with this gun.

1797
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:29,660
My late husband Othar taught me how to use it

1798
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:32,038
in case of a home invasion.

1799
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:39,712
Give him the gun, or I shoot the kids.

1800
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:49,388
Now,

1801
01:43:50,932 --> 01:43:52,016
the flash drive.

1802
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,733
Very good, Agent Turner.

1803
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:04,070
It took me a while to figure out. Then I remember.

1804
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:07,156
You're the master of disguise.

1805
01:44:13,747 --> 01:44:16,582
Take off the fat suit. I want to check you for weapons.

1806
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:25,508
Look, don't shoot the kids, all right?

1807
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:27,385
He don't remember what he saw.

1808
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,304
Kill them.

1809
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,099
And this time, no witnesses.

1810
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,309
My pleasure. Hey, Trent.

1811
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:36,852
I'm checking the flash drive.

1812
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:40,356
I'm sorry. I was wrong to think we could pull this off.

1813
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,816
This is my fault.

1814
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,026
No. You was just trying to protect me.

1815
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:47,446
I lied to you and everything. I'm sorry, Dad.

1816
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:52,118
All right, this family hour has to
end. I'm going to throw up.

1817
01:44:52,202 --> 01:44:54,829
Hey, whoa. Just let me say one last thing to my boy.

1818
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,709
You know, I'll go to my grave
wishing we could have done

1819
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:02,211
that Cleveland Shuffle together.

1820
01:45:02,295 --> 01:45:04,046
Remember? Mmm.

1821
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,756
Yeah.

1822
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:08,551
Killer step. If I just had one more chance.

1823
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:10,261
Remember, it'd be two to the right,

1824
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,722
two to the left.

1825
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,767
Now freak with it, freak with
it. Freak with it, freak with it.

1826
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:24,692
Enough! No more mistakes.

1827
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,653
I never leave a witness.

1828
01:45:29,322 --> 01:45:30,656
Wait.

1829
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:38,998
My name is Kurtis Kool

1830
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:41,333
and I just fried this fool.

1831
01:45:41,751 --> 01:45:42,960
FBI!

1832
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:45,838
Kurtis Kool.

1833
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,383
You saved my boy. Thank you, man.

1834
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:52,261
Just protecting the next generation of hip-hop.

1835
01:45:57,559 --> 01:45:59,268
Haley, hi.

1836
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:01,020
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1837
01:46:01,354 --> 01:46:02,396
I knew she was a narc.

1838
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,190
Hey, he's not a narc, he's a fed.

1839
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:05,691
Same thing. You're a boy.

1840
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:07,818
What's up? We cool now?

1841
01:46:08,778 --> 01:46:09,987

you to know I'm happy to do it.

You've grown up.

1846
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:34,136
I got to start trusting you in your decisions.

1847
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:38,682

Really? Yeah.

1854
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:13,008
You know, I realize there's no rush to greatness.

1855
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,594
I mean, you only get one chance to be the new guy.

1856
01:47:17,013 --> 01:47:18,931
Spoken like a real man.

1857

Okay. You don't want her busting
