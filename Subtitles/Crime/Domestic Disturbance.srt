1
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,999
All right ! Let her go !

2
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,559
It floats

3
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,519
Not bad, uh ?

4
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,000
It's fantastic

5
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,560
Can I get on ?

6
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:28,839
You paid for her

7
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,239
I'm the one who has to
ask permission to board

8
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,240
Go ahead

9
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,280
Here you go
Frank

10
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,879
No
I'll take one of these

11
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,160
To Frank Morrison
for building us the most

12
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,440
beautiful boat
in the water

13
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,200
Thank you ! Thank you !

14
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:49,920
That boat was the
bargain of the century

15
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,879
I made a price,
kept the price

16
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,519
And if you build
any more at that price

17
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,520
you'll go out of business

18
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,640
Theresa,
I should explain to

19
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,720
you my theory of
noble failure

20
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,640
But Danny's got
a game

21
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,280
See you

22
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,720
So how come
your boyfriend's

23
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,520
not coming
with you?

24
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,839
Danny said he wouldn't play

25
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,000
if he saw Rick in the stands

26
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,200
He's really got it in
for the guy, doesn't he?

27
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,479
Coach ! Coach !

28
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,359
How are you?

29
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,359
Hey, Frank,
how's it going ?

30
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,279
Where's Dan ?

31
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,080
He isn't here

32
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,040
Why not?

33
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,719
I asked him to stay,
but he chose to leave

34
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,959
I don't know where
he went yeah

35
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,920
This is
Frank Morrison

36
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,520
Oh, really?

37
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
What is that Danny?

38
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,960
Okay, we'll be there

39
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,600
He's at the police
station

40
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,000
Mom ! Dad !

41
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:08,439
I can't believe you
would stow away in some

42
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,679
complete stranger's car

43
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,120
Where did you think
you were going ?

44
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,440
No... Anywhere, What
difference does it make?

45
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,840
Christ, Danny,
what are you thinking ?

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,839
What's the big deal ?

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,240
I'm sorry, okay?

48
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,399
I just didn't feel like
playing today, so I booked

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,639
Mr. and Mrs. Morrison
Please come in

50
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,400
Wait here

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,600
The first time
we picked him up,

52
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,639
it was for breaking windows

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,120
Danny insisted that we
had the wrong kid

54
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
He wanted to hire a
lawyer, we remember

55
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,279
That was two years ago
after you guys separated

56
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,840
Six months later we got
him in here for truancy

57
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,280
That was right after - Right
after we got our divorce, yes

58
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,280
All this acting out is
Danny's way of

59
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,960
trying to get us
back together

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,160
Look we've
logged a lot of

61
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,279
hours a
lot of counsellors

62
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:51,600
Clearly, it hasn't
done us any good

63
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,640
Any idea what set him
off this time?

64
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,999
Yes, I'm sure it's because
I'm getting remarried

65
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,680
Oh, boy
who's the lucky guy?

66
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,279
Rick Barnes

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,560
I know Rick

68
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,999
Of course, you do
Everybody does

69
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,680
Congratulations then

70
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:07,880
Well, they do, honey

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
Your mom's
getting married

72
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,200
I know you don't
like it I get it

73
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,120
But you're not going to

74
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,880
use it as an
excuse to get wild

75
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,959
Okay, Dad

76
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,120
No, I'm not kidding,
Danny

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,439
Your mother's got a right
to move on with her life

78
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,039
I think you ought to give
this guy a break

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,279
What do you think?

80
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,440
Dad, do you ever wish that
things could be like they were?

81
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:38,480
Well, Danny, maybe you
don't remember,

82
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,000
But things weren't all
that great

83
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,760
I remember you were
home every day

84
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,160
Yeah, I know

85
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
The truth is, your mother
and I tried hard to make

86
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,399
it work out but we were

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
arguing all the time
and frankly

88
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:51,479
I didn't think I was doing

89
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,640
you any favours by
sticking around

90
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,160
Guess what?

91
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,280
The mast is up on the
big boat

92
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,879
So we're still going
sailing Saturday?

93
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,079
Yeah, you bet

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,080
Great

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,199
See you Saturday

96
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,159
Saturday

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,239
Frank, will you hold on
for a second ?

98
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,159
I'm sorry, Mom

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,240
It's okay, sweetheart

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
I love you
I love you, too

101
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,079
Bye, Dad

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,880
All right, so he said that
he would give Rick a break

103
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,239
At least it's something

104
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,719
Yeah, cool, thank you

105
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,079
Your're still taking him
sailing on Saturday?

106
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,680
Yeah, why?

107
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,920
It's just that Danny
takes his cues from you

108
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,120
And I thought that maybe
if you asked Rick to go

109
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,719
sailing with you guys
Jesus Susan I mean,

110
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,919
giving him a pep talk is
one thing

111
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,520
But taking your fiance
sailing with us?

112
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,400
Come on ! Jeez !

113
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry
I shouldn't have asked

114
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,840
Damn it

115
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,920
You okay?

116
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,240
Yeah, I'm okay

117
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,199
Susan asked me to take
Rick sailing with us this weekend

118
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,280
So Danny and he can bond

119
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:39,359
Maybe it's a good idea

120
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,319
What ?

121
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,199
Danny needs to
accept the fact

122
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,560
that his mom is
getting remarried

123
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,160
And you're going to have
to accept it too, Frank

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,480
I have no problem
accepting it

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,759
I don't want to hang out
with the guy, that's all

126
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,919
So what really bothers
you about sailing with Rick?

127
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,799
You afraid that Danny
might get to like him?

128
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,520
Maybe I don't want him
bonding with him

129
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,719
Maybe I don't want him
to have a new dad

130
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,359
Remember my friend,

131
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,200
His ex-wife ran away
with Keith Barrel,

132
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,320
the football player ?

133
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,040
We'll his kid admired
the guy so much

134
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
That he took his name

135
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,360
And then
eventually stopped

136
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,279
seeing his
dad altogether

137
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,520
Come on, Frank, Danny
loves you. You're his Dad

138
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:15,319
Diane,
these things happen

139
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,200
And Rick Barnes

140
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,880
Ever since he got in
town, everyone's just

141
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,640
falling all over him just
cause he's loaded

142
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,320
He's got more than just
money, Frank

143
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,120
Yeah, what?

144
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,600
According to everyone,
he's a very nice guy

145
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,239
Well, I'm a nice guy, too
but no one's falling

146
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,400
all over -Yes, you are

147
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:32,039
I'm just a boat builder
A poor boat builder at that

148
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:37,719
All right, it's just
like a car, okay?

149
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,680
You turn left to go left,
and right to go

150
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,559
Port

151
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,000
No, that's left

152
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,520
Right, right, right

153
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,640
And that's starboard

154
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:45,720
I know what you mean

155
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,600
Maybe we should stick
to lefts and rights

156
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:48,600
That way

157
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,759
That I understand

158
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,399
I'm impressed, Danny

159
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,479
You know a lot about
boats, man

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,039
You know, my Dad and I,

161
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,160
we spend a lot of time
out here

162
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,800
I can see why,
It's beautiful

163
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,600
Thanks for including me
today, I'm having fun

164
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,919
No problem

165
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,080
There are so many
beautiful places in the world

166
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,200
How did you end up here?

167
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,319
I invested in this
pharmaceutical company

168
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,799
They came out with this
new blood pressure medicine

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,999
Stock just went through
the roof

170
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,400
It was like winning
the lottery

171
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,560
It gave me a
chance to do

172
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,359
something different
with my life

173
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,479
You know, Frank, I'd never
try to take your place with him

174
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,359
I just want a shot at
being his friend

175
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,239
I tell you what
There are two

176
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,439
things you have to
remember with a kid

177
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,320
Number one

178
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,679
you have to show them
that you love them

179
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,999
Number two,
give them stuff

180
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,599
You mean bribe him, right?

181
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,880
If you bought him a new
baseball g love,

182
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,039
you'd be right in with him

183
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:43,919
Sounds like a plan

184
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:46,679
Danny ! Ready about !

185
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Pull it in. There you go

186
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,440
See you, Rick

187
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,519
See you later, Dan

188
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,840
Frank, you know the sea
Cliff Resort at Buzzard's Bay?

189
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,359
The dump? Sure
What about it?

190
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,920
Actually
I just bought it

191
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:11,479
It's beautiful

192
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:13,439
The idea is to
try to turn it

193
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,519
into something beautiful

194
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,879
How would
you feel about

195
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,959
building me
some boats?

196
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,240
We're so busy lately

197
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,720
Come on
Frank You would

198
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,880
be doing me a favour

199
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,400
I'll think about it

200
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,519
So

201
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,680
Are you maybe feeling
a little bit better

202
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,679
about your mom
marrying Rick, or what?

203
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,800
I guess, yeah

204
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,239
Good

205
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,999
But I'm still not going
to the wedding ?

206
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,239
Why is that?

207
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,159
It would just
be too weird

208
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,160
watching mom
get married

209
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:47,080
You have to go

210
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,119
Cause you're
going to break your

211
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,079
mother's heart
if you don't

212
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,640
You going ?

213
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,079
No, but that's different

214
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,400
We were married
It's different

215
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,199
See? It's too weird for
you, too

216
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,359
You're right, you're right

217
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,879
Okay, I tell you what,
I'll go if you go

218
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,679
Deal ?

219
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,439
Deal

220
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,160
Good, we'll make fun
of them together

221
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:19,279
Yeah

222
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,480
Susan sure did hit the
jackpot

223
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm kidding, Frank

224
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,200
Hey, Dad

225
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,120
Look at you
You are so handsome

226
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,240
I'm doing great, I guess

227
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,880
Wait, I got to show
you what Rick got me

228
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,039
I'll be right back

229
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,880
Dad !

230
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:39,399
It's a Cal Ripken g love

231
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,000
That's great

232
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,439
Everyone please
take your seats

233
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
The ceremony is
about to begin

234
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,560
Danny
time to get ready

235
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,680
Hey, folks, look over here

236
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:17,399
Susan

237
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,479
do you take Rick to be

238
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,279
your lawfully
wedded husband

239
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,559
for richer, for poorer, in
sickness and in health

240
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:25,959
till death do you part?

241
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,159
I do

242
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:30,719
Rick, do you take Susan
to be your lawfully

243
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,679
wedded wife

244
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,920
for richer, for poorer

245
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,080
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

246
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,720
I do

247
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
I now pronounce you
husband and wife

248
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,359
You may kiss the bride

249
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,279
You're a trooper
I'm proud of you

250
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,239
Appreciate you coming

251
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,840
Friend of Rick's
Congratulations

252
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,639
Long time no see

253
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah, Ray, we got a lot
of catching up to do

254
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:10,919
I can't wait

255
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,320
Thanks for dressing up

256
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:14,759
You look beautiful

257
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,599
Thank you

258
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,079
Congratulations

259
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,319
I'm glad you came

260
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,839
Thanks
Who's your buddy?

261
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,040
He's an old business
acquaintance

262
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm surprised he even
showed up

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,200
I know,
you looked surprised

264
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
What do you mean ?

265
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,920
You just looked surprised

266
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,479
Diet Coke and champagne
to go

267
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,880
How are you?

268
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,119
You're a friend of Rick's,
right?

269
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,159
That's right

270
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,240
Frank Morrison

271
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,279
Ray Coleman

272
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,119
Nice wedding, huh ?

273
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,160
She must know some
pretty good tricks to make

274
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,199
old Rick settle down

275
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,559
That's my ex-wife Susan

276
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,560
You ex?
You're kidding me

277
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,480
No

278
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,359
So where are you from?

279
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,519
Bay area, California

280
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,039
Came all the way out here
for the wedding, huh ?

281
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,280
I had some business
in DC

282
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,920
So how long you know
Rick?

283
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,920
We go way back, went
to school together

284
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:19,799
Really?

285
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,200
What about it?

286
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:22,560
Oh, nothing

287
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,639
He told me
that you were

288
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,999
in business together,

289
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,879
or something

290
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,480
Excuse me, Frank
Catch you later

291
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,400
It really is too bad

292
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,479
What's that, Ray?

293
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,719
You registered

294
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,800
I saw the gift table

295
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,079
Registered at Crate and
Barrel, wow

296
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:48,760
The dishes, table cloths,
soup tureens

297
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,599
You registered for a
soup tureen ?

298
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,639
That's what I would've
got you if I'd been

299
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,160
invited earlier

300
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,599
In fact, I could have
been your best man

301
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,719
I appreciate we got some
things to discuss here, Ray

302
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,639
But now's not a good
time

303
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:05,520
Are you busy?

304
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,040
What I'm going to do
is put you

305
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,159
up in a motel for a while

306
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,319
outside of town, and
I'll get in touch with you

307
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,319
in a couple of days

308
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,879
Why can't I stay here?
You've got plenty of room

309
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,320
That's not a good idea,
Ray

310
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,879
I'm very lucky, Danny

311
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm fortunate to have
three great men in my life

312
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,279
Who's number one?

313
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,840
You are, sweetheart

314
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,240
You'll always be
number one

315
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,639
I'll see you guys later

316
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,640
Where you going ?

317
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,239
I got some shopping
to do

318
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,800
All right, well, have fun

319
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,000
Come on, Rick,
throw the ball

320
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:52,960
See you later,
sweetheart

321
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,280
Good catch

322
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,079
Come on, you could
have had that

323
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,079
I should have had that?

324
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:02,919
Yeah

325
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
You should have had
that

326
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,880
My g love, it's not
broken in all the way

327
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,680
G love's not broken
in yet, all right

328
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,199
Is your arm not broken
in yet?

329
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,039
That was practically
right to you, Rick

330
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,919
That was practically
right to me

331
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,399
My dad would have
had that

332
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,160
Who's you dad,
Shaquille O'Neal ?

333
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,960
He used to be captain
of his baseball team

334
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,919
He's great all sports

335
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,760
You know, your dad is
going to be working for me

336
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,000
I hired him to
build me some boats

337
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:31,599
Did he
tell you that?

338
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,079
No, he didn't

339
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,079
If your dad's such a
great baseball player,

340
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,200
how come
he never taught you

341
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:42,880
how to
throw a baseball ?

342
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,039
I can throw the ball

343
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,200
Then why are you

344
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,879
standing with
your feet like this

345
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,519
and putting the ball
everywhere where I'm not?

346
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,240
When you throw a
baseball, you point your

347
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:50,840
foot to somebody so
the ball goes to them

348
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,120
Just throw the ball

349
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:53,359
I'm going to throw
the ball

350
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,879
But I don't want to run
or jump for the ball

351
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,159
I want the ball to
come to me

352
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,560
Aim and concentrate

353
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,200
Take it easy !

354
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,600
I am taking it easy
How the hell are you

355
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,080
supposed to learn
anything out here?

356
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,640
Come on,
turn the ball loose

357
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,639
You throw like shit

358
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,799
You know, Rick, I don't
want to play anymore

359
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,719
Suit yourself. Bring the
g loves in when you're done

360
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,760
Don't ask me to play again
if you're going to be a brat !

361
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,559
You want about a half
inch up

362
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,039
Just trim it off like that

363
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:33,839
All your strokes are

364
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,079
even and forward
like so, right?

365
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,840
And you use the other
side of the brush, as well

366
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,199
This is the important
part, make sure that the

367
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,999
edges don't dry

368
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,359
Because then you'll
get distortion

369
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,879
No open spots
You ready to try it?

370
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,040
What if I mess up?

371
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,280
That's a very interesting
question, 'cause that's

372
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,759
what I asked my dad

373
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,919
And that's what he
asked his father

374
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,439
So do you know what your
great grandfather told

375
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,200
your grandfather who

376
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,359
told your father
who's telling you now?

377
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,199
What?

378
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:01,839
That's why God
invented sandpaper

379
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,120
So this is okay?

380
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,200
Yeah, it's very good

381
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,879
So what happened with
that whole window thing ?

382
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,079
I told Mom it was an
accident

383
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,720
Yeah, well, tell me it
was an accident

384
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,080
I just got mad, okay?

385
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,039
Why, because he had a
problem with the way

386
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:25,999
you threw a ball ?

387
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,800
No, he threw it hard and
he tried to hurt me

388
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,440
Come on, Danny, was it
any harder than a line

389
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:31,400
drive coming at you?

390
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,520
No

391
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,479
Maybe he was just trying
to prepare you for a real game

392
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,399
or something

393
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,880
Why do you have to work
for him, anyway?

394
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,160
Tell him you don't want
his money,

395
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,360
that you don't
need anything from him

396
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,679
I can't do that

397
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,280
Why not?

398
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,119
Because the truth is,
Dan

399
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,440
I love making these
wooden boats,

400
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:51,799
but people
don't want them anymore

401
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,040
When your
grandpa made them,

402
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,320
they'd line up
from here to Maine

403
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:55,800
Just to have one

404
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,919
But they want
plastic now

405
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,559
It's cheaper, they can
afford it

406
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:01,879
You understand ?

407
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,839
Yeah

408
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,160
I was in the donut shop
this morning

409
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,240
You know
who I saw?

410
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:10,880
You know that girl Katie
that you like,

411
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,960
what's her
last name?

412
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,080
Lewis? she was there
with a girlfriend

413
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:16,120
She was talking about
you, she said, he's nice

414
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,600
or something like that

415
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,960
Since she got her braces
off, she's a total babe

416
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,680
I know, and then she
said that she thought

417
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,160
your dad was a fox

418
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,599
Here you go, Frank
Have a nice day

419
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:31,719
You too

420
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,760
How's it going ?

421
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,359
Frank Morrison, I met
you at Rick's wedding

422
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,440
Jesus, of course !

423
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:53,319
Ray, right !

424
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,159
You want to sit down ?

425
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,040
Sure

426
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,239
Sorry Frank, yeah

427
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:02,679
I'm getting really bad
with faces

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,319
It must be early
Alzheimer's or something

429
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,559
It's been a while since
the wedding

430
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,000
I wouldn't worry about it

431
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:10,079
I was just surprised
you're still here

432
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,280
You said something

433
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,200
about just being
in for the day

434
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,080
Yeah, I decided
to stick around,

435
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,440
grab myself a little R& R

436
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,159
Tell you what, Frank,

437
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:20,320
now that I've been here
for a while

438
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,480
I can see why Rick really
fell in love with the place

439
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,319
I'm actually
thinking about

440
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,799
looking at some
real estate myself

441
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,199
No kidding

442
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,319
I kid you not

443
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,680
Well, if you're serious
about it, I know a realtor

444
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,440
Sam Jones, he'll hook
you up

445
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,039
You know that
I'm noticing ?

446
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,599
I haven't seen any adult
bookstores in this town

447
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:41,720
No kidding

448
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,040
I kid you not

449
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,720
Just the man I wanted
to see

450
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:48,879
I owe you a call
Good to see you

451
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,879
You're a busy man

452
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,519
If you weren't so busy,

453
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,040
you wouldn't be getting

454
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,319
Southport's Man
of the year award

455
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,040
Yeah, well, it's a slow
year, we all know that

456
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:54,959
right?

457
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,959
How's the backhand
coming ?

458
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,960
Coming along, want to
play tomorrow?

459
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,360
Let me give you a call

460
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,160
Give my best to
everybody

461
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:02,999
I will

462
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,120
Open up, Ray

463
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,880
What the hell were

464
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,160
How did you know
I was in town ?

465
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:19,479
What are you doing with
my wife's ex, Ray?

466
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,040
Having eggs

467
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,680
Why did she leave him?
He was great

468
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,359
Told him
I was thinking

469
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,599
about buying some
property here

470
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,040
And he offered to find
me a realtor

471
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,320
Maybe you and me
could be neighbors

472
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,560
I had a good reason for

473
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,679
wanting you to stay out
of town, Ray

474
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,280
You talk too much
You always have

475
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,359
Maybe I'm not the
only one

476
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,279
How do you think
I found you?

477
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,160
When we
were on the

478
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,360
inside doing
our little stretch

479
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,840
We'd all take our best
shots at imagining

480
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,119
Where you'd run off to
spend our money

481
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,800
You're lucky it was only
me who figured it out

482
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,560
or you would have had

483
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:54,680
all three of us for
wedding guests

484
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,039
What about Tommy
and John ?

485
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,999
What about them?

486
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,759
What are you going to
send them their share?

487
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:08,760
So? Don't you want to
know how I found you?

488
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,680
Yeah, of course I do,
Ray

489
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,799
I remember this one
time you were drunk

490
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,520
and telling me how
crappy your childhood was

491
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,080
Except for this one
summer you spent on

492
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,159
the Maryland coast

493
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,240
Where there was clean
air and friendly people

494
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,880
I ain't saying you were
easy to find

495
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,080
I mean, I only had a
general idea of where

496
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:30,839
to look

497
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,920
and a lot of times I
came this close to just

498
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,320
giving it up

499
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:36,640
But then

500
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:45,479
then you made the
papers

501
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,040
You know, I'll tell you
something, Ray

502
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:57,439
You know what I came to
hate most about working

503
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:58,359
outside the law?

504
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,960
Having to associate
with scumbags

505
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:02,680
You found yourself a
lawyer to get

506
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:03,559
yourself off

507
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,639
Maybe that makes you
smarter than me

508
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,039
doesn't make you better

509
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:09,560
I'll call you, Ray

510
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm sick of you stalling
me, Jack !

511
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,439
I told you, Ray

512
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,160
it takes time to put

513
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,160
this kind of
money together

514
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,600
Name's Rick

515
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,800
It's funny how quick you
can forget a name

516
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:22,359
Rick

517
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,200
Stay out of town, Ray

518
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,000
You don't belong there

519
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,560
Well, I was right, the
doctor said pregnant

520
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,399
Baby, I'm so happy
That's so great

521
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,199
Oh, Susan, I bet you it's
going to be a boy, too

522
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:55,479
You want to
bet me on that?

523
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,319
What's wrong, honey?

524
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,240
Nothing

525
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,919
I just didn't expect it to
happen so soon,

526
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:01,840
that's all

527
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,239
You know how much I
wanted to have a baby

528
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,559
I'm happy

529
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,200
I know you do, I do, too
Promise

530
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,080
You just worried
about Danny, huh ?

531
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,560
Ya I'm just first married
and... Baby, it's hard

532
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,360
to handle, You know
for kid...

533
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,480
Danny ! Dan, Don't !

534
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,639
Sweetie, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

535
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,719
I did not mean it for you
to find out this...

536
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,480
Leave me alone, Mom !

537
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:21,239
Danny?

538
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,200
Danny, can you at least
try to be happy

539
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:24,359
for everybody?
No !

540
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Danny, please don't !

541
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,519
Please don't let him
ruin this

542
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,200
This is the happiest day
of my life

543
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:31,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

544
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,880
Just give me two minutes
I'll be right down

545
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,760
Diane, it's me, is my
dad there?

546
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,679
I have to talk to him

547
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,239
No, honey,
he's not home yet

548
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,160
When is he coming
home?

549
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:44,200
Soon, I guess, Danny,
are you okay?

550
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:45,959
Tell him he's got to
come and get me,

551
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,119
I have to talk to him

552
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,480
Who are you talking to?

553
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,399
Take me to my Dad's
house. I want to go now

554
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:52,879
No, this is between us

555
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,919
You and I are going to
sit down here and we're

556
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,159
going to talk this
through, okay?

557
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,799
I know that you're upset,
sweetheart,

558
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,079
but you have to believe
me when I tell you

559
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,000
that a baby
is not going

560
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:03,680
to change the way
I feel about you

561
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,639
I know, Mom, I'm
number one, remember ?

562
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,320
Check out of your room
Meet me out front at seven

563
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,800
Did you get it all ?

564
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,280
Yeah, Ray
I've got it all

565
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,760
All right,
I'll be waiting

566
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,359
About time

567
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:25,520
What did I miss?

568
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:27,680
Excuse me guys

569
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,720
I got to go into town
for a little while,

570
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,799
but it shouldn't take long

571
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,680
Okay, will you wait?

572
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:36,799
I'll walk you to your
car, okay?

573
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:41,560
We're not through
I'll be right back

574
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,679
How do you think the
conversation's going ?

575
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,040
You don't understand

576
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,239
I feel like I've betrayed
him, or something

577
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:39,720
Stop it, will you? You
haven't betrayed anybody

578
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,279
He's just upset
He'll get over it

579
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,200
Listen, I'll wrap this
thing up as soon as

580
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:46,840
I can and I'll be home
I love you

581
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,239
Please drive carefully

582
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:50,560
It looks like there's
a storm coming in

583
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:20,720
It's been a pleasure
having you

584
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:23,079
Mr. Coleman
Come back anytime

585
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,760
See you around
Take care

586
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:28,399
Put it in the back

587
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,479
Good - bye and good
riddance

588
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,799
So where you off to?

589
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,640
Miami Beach

590
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,440
Starting tomorrow

591
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,360
I'm going to be working on
my tan and a case of Cuervo

592
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,439
If you ever get fed up
here in Frontier land

593
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,399
come on down

594
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,000
Miami's got no appeal
for me

595
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,119
None whatsoever

596
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:16,519
I'm going to have a kid

597
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,680
Get the hell out of here

598
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,999
Isn't that great?

599
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:20,600
You're really going all
the way with this

600
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,680
" Leave it to Beaver " thing

601
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:22,839
Two kids?

602
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,280
Danny's not mine

603
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,679
That's got to be tough,

604
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,120
putting up with some
other guy's brat

605
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,439
I couldn't do it

606
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,439
I put up with the damn
kid because I got no choice

607
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,519
you know

608
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,159
I got to make a stop here

609
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,160
Why?

610
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,800
You don't think I had
that kind of cash on me

611
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:40,640
did you?

612
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,920
No, I got it stashed up
here at a brickworks I own

613
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Comes in handy for
stuff, Jesus !

614
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,320
What?

615
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,399
No, it's just that I've never
been out here before at night

616
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,360
And I can't see a goddamn
thing cause it's pouring

617
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,680
Are you kidding me?

618
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,040
No, I'm not kidding you
You see anything in this shit?

619
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,000
Jesus ! What are you,
lost?

620
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:13,400
Relax, it's around here
somewhere. Let me just

621
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,439
look at the map,
all right?

622
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,680
The map's in here

623
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,999
I got a flight to catch !

624
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,160
Stop bitching at me !
look in the back for the map

625
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,319
Jesus Christ

626
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,800
I don't see no
goddamn map

627
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,960
It's in here somewhere

628
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,439
You see it?

629
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:32,600
This is unbelievable !

630
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,719
Wait till you see what
you got back here

631
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,199
What's going on ?

632
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,600
It's Danny, Rick
He ran away

633
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,360
Are you okay?

634
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,399
I'm fine

635
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,599
It's okay, Mr. Barnes
Your wife got a call

636
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,920
from Mr. Morrison

637
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,239
Danny showed up over
there

638
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:06,719
Thank God, you want to
go get him?

639
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,720
Hold on, Mr. Barnes
There's more

640
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,399
What is it?

641
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,919
He told his father he
saw you kill a man

642
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,159
He told his father what?

643
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,560
He claims he was hiding
in the back of your Suburban

644
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:20,679
He says that's where he
saw you do it

645
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,159
Susan, what would make
Danny say something like this?

646
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,119
It's obvious,

647
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,759
Rick, it's Danny's way of getting

648
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:26,840
back at us for the baby

649
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,639
We should head down to
the station

650
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,600
And we'll be needing the
keys to your Suburban

651
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:47,999
I know what I saw, I'm
not making this up

652
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:49,479
He killed a guy

653
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:51,879
Danny, are you sure
you're not doing this

654
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,040
because you're
mad at Rick?

655
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,199
Diane, please

656
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,359
Danny, let's go over this
again, all right?

657
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,000
Take your time, start
from the beginning

658
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,120
Don't leave anything out

659
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,720
Send them in

660
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:09,159
It's your mother and
stepfather

661
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:10,160
They're going to join us

662
00:36:10,479 --> 00:36:12,240
No Dad, please no
I don't want to see him, Dad

663
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:17,800
Danny

664
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,319
A already told you, he
never said his name

665
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:30,760
Dad ?

666
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,760
Just answer the question
It's okay

667
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,400
And you say that
you heard

668
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,560
your stepfather and
this man

669
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,920
talking about money

670
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,680
They were supposed to be
going to get some money

671
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,679
Only, Rick killed him
instead

672
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:41,840
Danny, stop this, please

673
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:43,399
He said that he loved

674
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:44,239
the baby and that he hated me

675
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,000
Sweetheart, listen, I
know that we've hurt you,

676
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,519
But what you're doing
isn't fair, it's not right

677
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,239
I'm telling the truth

678
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:52,999
No, Danny, you're doing

679
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,000
what you do when a situation

680
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,560
comes along
that you can't handle

681
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,120
Look, he knows the truth,
he knows what he did

682
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:00,520
and you're just going to
sit there and let him get

683
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:01,880
away with it, Dad

684
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:03,800
Come in

685
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,640
Johnson just called in
from the brickworks

686
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:09,479
Excuse me

687
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,559
So, no charbroiled
skeletons?

688
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:19,160
If a body was incinerated

689
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,599
in a kiln like they got over there,

690
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,199
it would take a forensic
specialist-

691
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,240
I am not wasting
any more time or money

692
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:26,079
on this sick kid's
bullshit story

693
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:28,760
David, phone call,
line seven

694
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,639
Hold on

695
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,680
Stevens

696
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,320
It's the garage
Okay, go on

697
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:52,920
There was

698
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,079
No visible evidence at
all at the brickworks

699
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,119
or, for that matter,
in your truck

700
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,279
Keys are at the front desk
You all should go home

701
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,039
Danny, let's go home

702
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,200
I'm not going home
with him

703
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,039
Danny, we are going to
go home and talk about this

704
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:15,839
okay?

705
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,959
Dad, please don't make
me go home

706
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,079
Susan, let him come
home with me

707
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:20,839
No, Frank, every time he
has a problem,

708
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:21,759
he comes
running to you

709
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,360
I want him to come
home now

710
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:24,960
Dad, don't make me go

711
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,760
Jesus, Danny,
knock it off !

712
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,760
Dad ? You don't believe
me, either ?

713
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:30,080
You're asleep right now
This is a dream

714
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,120
You're dreaming that
someone's got their

715
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,799
hand over your mouth and
it's hard to breathe

716
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,999
and you can't wake up,
can you?

717
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,639
can you?

718
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,559
Now, you had a dream
about a murder

719
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:47,520
And it felt like it was
real

720
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:50,800
It's only a nightmare

721
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,760
You don't want every
moment of your life to

722
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:55,440
be a big screaming nightmare

723
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,039
do you, Danny?

724
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:00,520
Better wake up

725
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:39,280
He wants me to pick them up?

726
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,960
Have the port lights come in

727
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,199
I'm expecting them this
afternoon

728
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:43,360
All right, call and
make sure

729
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,199
Hey, how you doing ?
Good morning

730
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,440
How are you, Frank?

731
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,079
Rick

732
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:50,879
You got a hell of a
place here

733
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,120
Frank, I just want to let
you know I'm not taking

734
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:55,919
what happened last
night personally

735
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,600
I just look forward to
getting past it

736
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,239
But on to something more
positive here, I do have

737
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,440
the start- up money for
the Seacliff, $50,000

738
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:08,760
When do you think you
could start building the boats?

739
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,320
You know, when I went
home last night,

740
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,520
I couldn't
even think about sleeping

741
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,280
But here's what I did
think about

742
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,359
My son is living with you
in your house

743
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,760
And I have absolutely no

744
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:24,319
idea of what kind
of man you really are

745
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,440
and, honestly, that scares
the hell out of me

746
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,800
Well, Frank, you're a good
dad, you know

747
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:34,879
But before you start
letting your imagination

748
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,600
Run away with you here,

749
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:38,960
I'd ask you to remember
something

750
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,520
It's true that you may not
know me so well, but

751
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,000
you do know Danny

752
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,160
and he lies, I know that

753
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,400
He lies to his mother
his grandmother

754
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:51,320
His teachers, the police

755
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,280
Just about everybody, but

756
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,279
But what?

757
00:43:57,439 --> 00:43:58,359
He doesn't lie to me

758
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:01,799
Hard as I tried, I couldn't
think of a sing le time

759
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,320
I didn't kill anybody,
Frank

760
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,360
probably not, Rick

761
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:08,399
I'm glad to hear you
say that

762
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:10,879
As long as my son is
living with you under your roof,

763
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,040
" probably" isn't good
enough

764
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,959
Jesus Christ, Frank, who's
this guy, Ray?

765
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,919
What about him?

766
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,040
He's your
school chum

767
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,439
he's your business
acquaintance

768
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,720
The other day I saw him,
he was looking for real estate

769
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,439
Ray
Yeah

770
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:31,199
So now it's Ray
I supposedly killed,

771
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:36,440
is that right?

772
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,559
I tell you, Frank, trying
to be a stepfather

773
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,439
To a child that hates
your guts,

774
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:41,839
isn't exactly a picnic

775
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,159
I thought you were on
my side for this

776
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,440
I'm on Danny's side

777
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:52,239
Give my best to Diane
then, Frank

778
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:58,640
Right

779
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,959
I just think it's a good
idea if he stays with

780
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,799
that's all

781
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:02,199
I'm not having this
conversation with you

782
00:45:02,439 --> 00:45:04,080
I know that Rick
threatens you-

783
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,200
He threatens me,
all right

784
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,519
You're so wrong
about him

785
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,159
You don't even know
what he's really about

786
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,760
You're the one that
I don't really know

787
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:11,159
anything about anymore,
Frank

788
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,640
Do you think that I so
desperately need a man,

789
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,879
that I'm going to endanger
my own child by marring a-

790
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,640
Danny

791
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,719
What are you
doing here?

792
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,519
Come on,
Danny, let's go

793
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,479
No, he's coming home
with me

794
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,000
He's scared of the guy
It's not right

795
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:20,959
What do you get?

796
00:45:21,479 --> 00:45:24,160
Have I ever stopped you
from seeing him?

797
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,280
This is not about custody

798
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,880
Danny, please get
in my car

799
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,439
If you want to fight me
for custody-

800
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:29,920
I don't want to fight you
for custody !

801
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,079
Please don't do this !

802
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,640
Hold on a second, Frank

803
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,920
This is none of your
business

804
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:34,959
What if I make it my
business?

805
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:37,239
Don't !

806
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:40,119
Frank, don't do this !

807
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,639
I'm sorry, Mike

808
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,320
Dad, that was so cool

809
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,400
Put your seat belt on

810
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,080
That was awesome

811
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,040
Knock it off, Danny

812
00:45:58,239 --> 00:45:59,560
You know what I've
just done?

813
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,920
It's called kidnapping

814
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:02,000
How could it be
kidnapping ?

815
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm your kid

816
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:04,080
It just is
It doesn't matter

817
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,039
So you believe me now?

818
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:06,919
Yeah, yeah

819
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,519
What are we going to
do now? I don't know

820
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,439
Dad, watch out !

821
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,079
You never struck me
as the kind of guy

822
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,559
Who would exploit the
emotional problems of

823
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,359
his son to make a play
for custody

824
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,920
Sergeant, I know you have
a history with my son

825
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:41,080
I know that's why you're
having a hard time with this

826
00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:42,360
But this character,

827
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,000
Ray Coleman
he was at the weeding -

828
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,679
When Ray Coleman
showed up at the wedding,

829
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,599
Rick Barnes
wasn't happy to see him

830
00:46:47,879 --> 00:46:48,640
But there's more

831
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:49,959
they had two different
stories about how they met

832
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,479
Maybe Ray Coleman is
a little confused

833
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,119
But he wasn't confused

834
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,920
Maybe he'd been
drinking, come on now

835
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:02,080
You can go now
Mr. Morrison

836
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:04,599
Your ex-wife isn't
pressing charges

837
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,439
And, for the time being,
neither are we

838
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,319
By the way, I checked
with the police in the

839
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,199
Bay Area

840
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,239
No Ray Coleman was
reported missing

841
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:16,119
That's not good enough

842
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,399
Good-bye, Mr. Morrison

843
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,080
Jack, look, it was not

844
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,000
my intention to
fight for custody

845
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,159
But now I have
no choice, do I ?

846
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:31,840
Right !

847
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:36,719
Okay, all right, I'll see
you there at 10. Thanks

848
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:41,079
That was Berman
He's tough, man

849
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,760
But he's good, he's the
one who handled the

850
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:44,919
whole divorce thing

851
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,600
Just have to figure out
What?

852
00:47:48,919 --> 00:47:49,840
I'm sorry, Frank

853
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:53,039
I can't believe that you
have actually managed to

854
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,559
convince yourself that
this man -This man ?

855
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,559
This man who only
wanted to help-This man ?

856
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,800
Do you want me to
ignore the fact that my son is

857
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:02,519
living with a killer ?
is that what you want?

858
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,520
This fantasy of yours,

859
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,760
it sure does give you a
good excuse, doesn't it?

860
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:08,559
For what? Excuse for what?

861
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:10,999
An excuse to hold on to
your old life

862
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:14,439
I know Danny's your son,

863
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,759
And I would never ask
you to choose between us

864
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,640
But I won't hang around
while you take Susan on

865
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,759
in some insane
custody battle

866
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,520
Diane, I have never
failed Danny, ever

867
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,399
And I can't fail him now
not when it counts

868
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:30,280
I'm sorry

869
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:31,680
I'm sorry too, Frank

870
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,479
But I can't do this

871
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,719
Rick, sweetheart will you
please hurry up?

872
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:42,719
I don't
want to be late for this

873
00:48:43,919 --> 00:48:45,240
Calm down will you?

874
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:47,520
Moms always win these
things, right?

875
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:49,200
No, it's never a sure
thing, Rick

876
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:53,080
You all right?

877
00:48:54,479 --> 00:48:56,119
I still can't believe
this is happening

878
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,640
You know, Susan

879
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:03,760
ever since Frank hit us
with this custody thing,

880
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:05,319
there's something I'd like
to talk to you about

881
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,760
About what?

882
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,840
Well, I feel like I've done

883
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,079
Everything I can but
stand on my head with

884
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,680
Danny's concern

885
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,959
And he won't give me a
break. There's no way-

886
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,600
I know and I'm sorry
sweet pea

887
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:19,199
There's nothing for you
to be sorry about

888
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,439
It's been hard on
everybody

889
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,920
But maybe if Danny went
off to live with Frank

890
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:25,079
for a little while

891
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:26,240
That wouldn't be the
worse thing in the world

892
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,040
for everybody

893
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:27,920
What?

894
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,800
I'm just trying to think
about what would be

895
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:31,079
best for everyone, dear

896
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:32,560
Rick

897
00:49:32,759 --> 00:49:33,360
Susan

898
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,800
things get really tense
when Danny's around

899
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:38,160
and the doctor said if
you get stressed out,

900
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:39,319
you could lose the baby

901
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,839
I don't give a damn
what the doctor said,

902
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,880
Danny's my son

903
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,959
It's bad enough he hardly
talks to me anymore

904
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,000
If he goes to live with Frank

905
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:48,239
I'd be lucky if I ever
see him again

906
00:49:48,439 --> 00:49:49,440
Rick,
we talked about this

907
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:50,439
I'm sorry

908
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:51,599
Danny's not going to go
anywhere,

909
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:53,400
I promise
you that, okay?

910
00:49:58,239 --> 00:49:59,560
Dan, listen up

911
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:02,600
Whatever the judge
decides today

912
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:05,080
I want you to know that
your mother loves you

913
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,000
remember that

914
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:08,080
I'll see you there

915
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:08,920
All right

916
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:09,639
Love you

917
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,520
Love you, too

918
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,239
I'm ready to go

919
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:23,000
Mom?

920
00:50:23,399 --> 00:50:24,599
She's bringing the car
around,

921
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,239
Danny She can't hear you

922
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,759
I'm not afraid of you

923
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:29,839
I don't give a damn if
you're afraid of me or not

924
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,400
What I want to know is,

925
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,719
do I need to be afraid of you
Danny?

926
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:38,520
What do you mean ?

927
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:42,880
This custody hearing

928
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,599
thing that you have
us all going to today

929
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,239
if we come home
without you

930
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:49,159
Dan

931
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,199
that's going to upset
your mom

932
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,000
and like I said to you
I can't allow that to happen

933
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,039
Now, I know that you
love your dad very much

934
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,479
How would you feel if
something happened to him?

935
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,840
Look, I'll do whatever
you want

936
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,439
Just, please,
leave them alone

937
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:09,239
I want both parties
to know

938
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:11,519
That a child of
Danny's age

939
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:13,080
is old enough to have a
voice in determining

940
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,280
which parent he would be
better off living with

941
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,359
Now, that being said

942
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:20,240
call your witness
Mr. Berman

943
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,519
Thank you

944
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,760
Your honour, we'd like to call
Danny Morrison to the stand

945
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,720
Hello, Danny

946
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,000
Danny Morrison ?

947
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:50,879
Yes, sir

948
00:51:51,279 --> 00:51:51,959
How old are you?

949
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,599
I'm 12, sir

950
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:55,399
Twelve, so we can't
swear you in

951
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,199
But it is your word of
honour when you sit in

952
00:51:58,439 --> 00:52:00,359
that witness box

953
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:01,319
do you understand that?

954
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:02,159
Yes, sir

955
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,479
Good,
then let's get to work

956
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,600
Counsellor

957
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:07,840
Thank you, Your honour

958
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,359
Hello, Danny

959
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,359
I'm going to ask you a
few questions

960
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:14,319
you all right with that?

961
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:16,239
All right, let's go back

962
00:52:16,439 --> 00:52:17,680
to the evening of October 18th

963
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,040
That was the night your
mother cane home from the

964
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:21,639
doctor with some news

965
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,639
just tell what
happened

966
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,000
I found out that my mom
was going to have a baby

967
00:52:28,919 --> 00:52:30,600
Yeah ? How did you
handle that?

968
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,520
I guess I kind of freaked

969
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:35,960
Go on

970
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,800
After that, I wanted to
go and see my dad

971
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,559
How come?

972
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:42,839
Cause I felt like I needed
to talk things over with him

973
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,560
You and your dad are
pretty close then ?

974
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,159
Yes, sir

975
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,199
All right, Danny, just
take your time and tell us

976
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:52,120
what happened next

977
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:55,280
Well, I hid in the back
of Rick's truck

978
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:57,519
cause he was going
into town,

979
00:52:57,719 --> 00:52:59,239
and that's near where
my dad lives

980
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,200
And then

981
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,680
And then he stopped at
this office building and

982
00:53:09,879 --> 00:53:10,800
I jumped out

983
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,119
What?

984
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,520
I ran to my dad's house,

985
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,679
And I made up this story

986
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:16,319
about seeing him kill some guy

987
00:53:16,479 --> 00:53:18,279
Danny, what are you
doing ? Tell them the truth

988
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:19,959
This is the truth, Dad

989
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:21,519
Did he threaten you?

990
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:22,800
You keep this up
Mr. Morrison,

991
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,600
I will have you removed
from this courtroom

992
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:27,559
This is not how
Frank sit down

993
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:32,600
Let me ask you
something, Danny

994
00:53:33,479 --> 00:53:34,039
Do you want to give it

995
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:36,119
another try with your
mom and Rick

996
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:37,999
Or do you think you'd

997
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,399
be better off living
with your dad ?

998
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:49,959
I'd like to stay with my
mom and Rick

999
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,959
Look
Frank

1000
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:15,479
I know what
happened today

1001
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,759
I'm glad somebody
does. Drink?

1002
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:20,239
I'm not going to
drink with you

1003
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:20,880
Frank

1004
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:21,639
Too bad

1005
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:23,320
You ought to go home

1006
00:54:26,439 --> 00:54:27,119
Okay
Frank

1007
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,159
Danny lied

1008
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:30,719
Again

1009
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,279
But at least he's not

1010
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,599
living under the same
roof with a killer

1011
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,239
I'll drink to that

1012
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:44,600
No, this is how you
lost Danny the first time

1013
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,000
Come on
Frank let's go home

1014
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,520
That's the best offer
I've had in a while

1015
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,079
You get fresh
Frank

1016
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:52,840
I'll make it real

1017
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,640
It's my day to see him
Susan

1018
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:08,839
Yeah, I know it is

1019
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,359
What?

1020
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,920
I tried talking to him

1021
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,159
but he just
went racing out

1022
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,679
I'm sure he just feels
badly about lying to you

1023
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,959
I'm sure it'll be okay
I'm sorry

1024
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:24,959
I have to go,

1025
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,919
But I promise I'll tell
him to call you

1026
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,640
Cheeseburger and
french fries

1027
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:50,759
Can I get you anything
to drink?

1028
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,479
Diet Coke

1029
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:53,040
Sounds good

1030
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,079
Took me 15 years to get

1031
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,839
one of these. How long
you been here?

1032
00:56:03,399 --> 00:56:04,720
Been here about two years

1033
00:56:04,919 --> 00:56:06,320
but I being here
for a long time

1034
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:07,399
Two years

1035
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:08,520
At the rate you're going,

1036
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:10,119
we'll be naming the town
after you

1037
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:13,679
Thank you very much, I
appreciate it. Thank you

1038
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,199
I'd just like to say

1039
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:23,799
thank you to the men and
women of Southport

1040
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,079
For recognizing me with

1041
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,080
this honour, I feel flattered
to be included

1042
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:53,439
Hey, Dan

1043
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:54,640
Hey, Dad

1044
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:56,440
You're a hard man to
get a hold of lately

1045
00:56:56,639 --> 00:56:57,640
What are you doing here?

1046
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,079
What is this about,
Frank?

1047
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,280
I'm just trying to talk
to my son

1048
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:01,399
Ten o'clock at night?

1049
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,000
It's not your business

1050
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,520
Frank, do you really
think

1051
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:11,920
That showing up here
drunk in front of your son

1052
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:13,639
What is that supposed

1053
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,519
to make him want to spend
more time around you?

1054
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:18,479
Are you crazy
Frank?

1055
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:19,399
What are you doing ?

1056
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:20,679
Screw you, Patterson !

1057
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,280
Just because this
asshole's got some money

1058
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,960
to spread around you don't
give a shit who he is !

1059
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:25,600
Dad why don't you
just go home?

1060
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,400
Dad you dropped
your wallet

1061
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,000
Dad wait up

1062
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:42,200
Sorry Danny I shouldn't
have come here

1063
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,799
You dropped your wallet

1064
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,159
That's not my wallet, Dan

1065
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,679
Dad, you have to stop
making trouble for him

1066
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,440
So, Dad, please
just lay off, okay?

1067
00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:07,439
How are you?

1068
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,960
What do you want?

1069
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:13,800
Nothing much

1070
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:15,239
Just five bucks

1071
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:18,519
You wouldn't happen to
have $5 you could lend

1072
00:58:18,759 --> 00:58:20,640
your old step dad
would you, Dan ?

1073
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:22,239
No

1074
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:23,319
You don't?

1075
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:25,320
Maybe we should
check your wallet

1076
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,880
Where's your wallet,
Danny?

1077
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,479
I don't know

1078
00:58:29,999 --> 00:58:30,640
You don't know?

1079
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:33,719
Don't you think you

1080
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,880
should probably
start looking for it?

1081
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:36,960
I really hope you didn't
lose that, Dan

1082
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,639
Start looking for it

1083
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:40,520
I didn't tell him
anything, Rick

1084
00:58:41,439 --> 00:58:42,040
Maybe you think I've

1085
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:43,479
just been fooling around
with you

1086
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,480
is that it, Danny?

1087
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,199
All I did was say I was
sorry for not being home-

1088
00:58:49,399 --> 00:58:49,919
Bullshit !

1089
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,959
I swear to God,
that's all I said

1090
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:53,879
You're a little fucking
liar, aren't you, Danny?

1091
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,040
I'm telling the truth, Rick

1092
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,040
I hope so

1093
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,160
Does Ray Coleman
sound familiar to you?

1094
01:00:25,919 --> 01:00:27,640
Ray Coleman ? That name
doesn't sound familiar

1095
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,399
Would you check your
register ?

1096
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:33,000
Because my sister's
really worried about him

1097
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:00,759
Here we go, Ray Coleman

1098
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,560
Checked in on
September the 8th

1099
01:01:04,919 --> 01:01:06,519
and checked out on -

1100
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,919
check the 18th

1101
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,399
Yeah, October 18th

1102
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,400
How about a telephone
number, address?

1103
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,079
I could check his bill

1104
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,280
Yeah, yeah

1105
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:22,679
Here we go, C, Coleman

1106
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,240
These are just the
local calls

1107
01:01:26,439 --> 01:01:27,239
What's this?

1108
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,280
Pizza Hut

1109
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:29,999
How about this?
He called this a lot

1110
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:31,800
Yeah, he liked the ladies

1111
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:43,399
You patty?

1112
01:01:43,959 --> 01:01:44,560
Who are you?

1113
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:46,159
A friend of Ray's

1114
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:47,799
Ray?

1115
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:48,720
Coleman

1116
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:51,919
That shit owes me money

1117
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,640
Join the club

1118
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,320
Can I talk to you?

1119
01:01:57,799 --> 01:01:58,479
I didn't know Ray that

1120
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:00,120
well, we were just
killing time

1121
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,200
You know how it is

1122
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:03,400
Yeah, I can't believe
this guy

1123
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,880
He never even told you
where he was from?

1124
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,000
No

1125
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,200
What did you guys
talk about?

1126
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:10,640
We didn't do that
much talking

1127
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:14,920
We weren't doing that

1128
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,160
We were watching TV

1129
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:17,679
I don't know what Ray
likes better

1130
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,000
to screw or
watch basketball

1131
01:02:19,919 --> 01:02:20,839
At least he gave me this

1132
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:23,879
I know that lighter
Let me see

1133
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:30,359
Oh, yeah

1134
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,399
It was my birthday a
couple of weeks ago

1135
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,120
I like this lighter

1136
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,280
It's not even real

1137
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,919
Yeah, but I like the
horseshoe thing

1138
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:43,560
Buy it from you
How much ?

1139
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:46,919
I don't know, it's a
pretty nice lighter

1140
01:02:50,759 --> 01:02:51,520
$25

1141
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,320
Cool

1142
01:02:54,999 --> 01:02:57,359
If you can just have this
dusted for prints

1143
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,559
I'm sure we'll find that
this Ray Coleman's

1144
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:00,759
got a record

1145
01:03:00,919 --> 01:03:01,800
And if he does

1146
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:02,279
then we know that Rick Barnes

1147
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:03,000
will have one, too

1148
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,279
A lot of people have
handled this lighter

1149
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,599
The lab could
only manage

1150
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,200
to lift off one
clean set of prints

1151
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,839
It turns out they belong
to a convicted felon

1152
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:02,239
Her name is Patty Walsh

1153
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,519
Prostitution, Drug use

1154
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:17,639
Hey, Frank

1155
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,439
I'm glad I ran into you

1156
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,240
About last night, we
both got a little bit hot

1157
01:04:24,439 --> 01:04:25,600
under the collar

1158
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:27,000
And I felt terrible
about it

1159
01:04:28,439 --> 01:04:29,239
Recognize that?

1160
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,200
Probably fell out of Ray's

1161
01:04:36,399 --> 01:04:37,359
pocket when you pulled
him from the truck

1162
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:39,919
What are you doing,
Frank?

1163
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:40,959
You touch

1164
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,079
so much as one hair
on my son's head

1165
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,719
and I swear, as God is
my witness

1166
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:49,879
that'll be the last thing
you ever do in this world

1167
01:05:08,359 --> 01:05:09,360
You're the second guy today

1168
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:10,760
who's been in here
looking for Ray Coleman

1169
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:41,639
You again ?
What do you want?

1170
01:05:41,959 --> 01:05:43,239
What basketball team
did he root for ?

1171
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,799
What are you talking
about?

1172
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:45,719
You said that he liked

1173
01:05:45,919 --> 01:05:46,640
to screw and watch
basketball, what team

1174
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,520
did he root for ?

1175
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,800
Chicago

1176
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,159
Ray Coleman -Three

1177
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,920
Convictions in
Racketeering Case

1178
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,279
Oh, God

1179
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:46,840
Is Detective Stevens
there?

1180
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,359
No, this is
Frank Morrison

1181
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,640
When will he be back?

1182
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:58,479
You have an e-mail
address there?

1183
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,479
Thank you
No, wait, listen

1184
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:05,799
When he gets in, have
him check his e-mail

1185
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:08,079
And have him call Frank
Morrison at the boathouse

1186
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,240
as soon as he gets it

1187
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:10,360
Thank you

1188
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,480
As you can see, this
venerable building

1189
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,879
a long time fixture in the
Southport community

1190
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,359
Continues to bum

1191
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,999
It just keeps ringing,
Mom

1192
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,520
It's okay, sweetheart
You know how careful Dad is

1193
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,840
I'm sure he's fine
He's fine

1194
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:29,719
No, Mom, Rick said
he'd do this !

1195
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,160
He said he'd hurt Dad !

1196
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:32,319
He killed the guy,
just like I said,

1197
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,160
and he threatened to
kill Dad, too !

1198
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,959
Forget it, Mom, you won't
believe me, anyway

1199
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,879
Danny, what are you
talking about?

1200
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,360
Danny, we're getting
out of here

1201
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,520
Mom?

1202
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:30,840
Now

1203
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,319
Sweetheart, I didn't
hear you come in

1204
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,239
Just got back

1205
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:45,999
Danny, you go wait
in the car

1206
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:46,959
Where are you going ?

1207
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,040
There was a fire at
Frank's place and the

1208
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:50,040
boathouse burned down

1209
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:50,759
What?

1210
01:11:50,959 --> 01:11:51,919
Danny wants to go and
make sure

1211
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:53,279
that Frank is okay

1212
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:54,440
You want
me to take you?

1213
01:11:54,759 --> 01:11:55,439
It's okay

1214
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,600
Danny's really upset and
I think it's best if I

1215
01:11:56,799 --> 01:11:58,919
take him alone, okay?

1216
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,240
Stevens

1217
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:11,560
What is this?

1218
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,160
Frank Morrison sent
it over

1219
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:16,640
Rick Barnes, indicted for
extortion bribery

1220
01:12:16,839 --> 01:12:17,919
attempted murder

1221
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,759
His real name is
Jack Pamell

1222
01:12:19,999 --> 01:12:20,959
Your reckon the

1223
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:21,879
Chicago Chamber of
Commerce gave

1224
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:22,959
him an award, too?

1225
01:12:40,759 --> 01:12:42,519
Hello?

1226
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,240
Frank Morrison

1227
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:56,520
Susan, it's Frank
Now, listen

1228
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,839
You and Danny get
out of the house now !

1229
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:00,999
I know I'm in the car
with Danny-

1230
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,560
I think I better drive
Danny

1231
01:13:13,879 --> 01:13:15,239
I'm fine, Rick

1232
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:17,000
Get out of the car, Susan

1233
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:17,840
Mom?

1234
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:19,639
It's okay, sweetheart

1235
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,479
I just need to hang on to
him till I'm someplace safe

1236
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,039
Please don't do this
Please

1237
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,160
Mom, are you all right?

1238
01:13:27,879 --> 01:13:28,479
Give me the keys

1239
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,959
Take me instead, please

1240
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:34,080
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me

1241
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:44,519
Run, Danny, run !

1242
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,439
You bitch !

1243
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,000
Danny, go lock the doors
and the living room !

1244
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,079
Did you lock everything ?

1245
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:16,279
Yeah,
did you call the police?

1246
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:18,600
Go ! Run !

1247
01:14:20,559 --> 01:14:21,679
Leave him alone !

1248
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,160
Mom, get up
Mom, wake up

1249
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,839
Mom, please get up

1250
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:51,079
Get up

1251
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:01,759
You're going to sit still,
aren't you?

1252
01:18:44,799 --> 01:18:45,520
You sure you're
going to be okay?

1253
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,199
I'll be fine, Mom

1254
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,320
We'll follow you
to the hospital

1255
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,599
Frank, I'm sorry

1256
01:18:51,759 --> 01:18:53,959
No, it's okay

1257
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,560
I'm sorry about the baby

1258
01:18:58,719 --> 01:18:59,640
Mom, I love you

1259
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,439
I love you too,

Mr. Morrison, hold on

1261
01:19:13,519 --> 01:19:14,239
There's really not a
whole lot

1262
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,719
I can say right
now, except

1263
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,680
Just say it to him

1264
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,839
Danny, I'm sorry

1265
01:19:24,519 --> 01:19:25,359
It's all right
