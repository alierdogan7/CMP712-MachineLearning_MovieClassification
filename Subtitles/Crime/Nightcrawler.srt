like it's something

859
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,746
that I may be
interested in,
but I'm not.

860
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,948
You don't even
understand the offer.

861
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,317
If you did, you'd be
fucking sucking my dick!

862
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,786
You'd be asking me questions.

863
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:31,888
What does this mean?
What does that mean?

864
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,391
I feel like grabbing you
by your ears right now

865
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:37,794
and screaming in your face,

866
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,716
"I'm not
fucking interested."

867
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,920
Instead,
I'm going to drive home
and do some accounting.

868
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:50,206
Fuck you!

869
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:52,041
Twerp.

(MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING)

872
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,024
(SIGHS) I didn't
wake up until 5:00.

873
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:10,927
My body is so off,
I feel like it's
time for breakfast.

874
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,262
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

875
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,034
I bet you're beautiful
any time of the day.

876
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:20,970
In fact, I'd say

877
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,772
you're much prettier
than Lisa Mays.

878
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:23,873
(LAUGHS)

879
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,210
I like the dark
makeup on your eyes.

880
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:29,332
I also like the way you smell.

881
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,683
So, where you from, Lou?

882
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,074
The north end of the Valley.

883
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,990
Some of the calls sometimes
take me over there,

884
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,726
but nobody I know
still lives out there.

885
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:45,795
You're from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.

886
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:47,997
How did you know that?

887
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:49,199
It's online.

888
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,868
Everything about you is online.

889
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,303
Not everything,
but definitely a lot.

890
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,239
I've watched all the videos
from when you were a reporter.

891
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:57,473
I'm sure you look
at those, of course.

892
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,175
No. God, no.

893
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:00,457
Not without a drink in my hand.

894
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:04,213
I watch my work all the time.

895
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,848
Yeah? Do you want
to become a reporter?

896
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,970
No.

897
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,819
Most of you guys want air time.

898
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,587
Not me.

899
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:15,024
I want to be the guy
that owns the station
that owns the camera.

900
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:17,593
The business is going well,

901
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,495
but in order to
grow to the next level,

902
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:20,863
I need to stay
one step ahead
of my competition

903
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,265
and take risks.

904
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,427
I also need financial support
to implement expansion.

905
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,617
Would you like
another margarita?

906
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,473
One is enough.

907
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,529
Thanks for coming out to talk.

908
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:35,778
The place I'm in now

909
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,214
is that I want a relationship

910
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:40,549
with someone I can team up with

911
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,519
and share, like we share,
the same job
and hours and whatnot.

912
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,254
I could go down
a laundry list,
but you get the idea.

913
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,889
Yes.

914
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,691
Well, I hope you find someone.

915
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:53,296
Here's the thing
about that, Nina.

916
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:55,378
I'm quite certain
I already have.

917
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,035
Okay.

918
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:02,371
Let me put this politely.

919
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,540
I only came out to
dinner with you, Lou,

920
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,809
purely as
a professional courtesy.

921
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:10,513
Thank you.

922
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:14,150
I don't think it's any secret

923
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:15,618
that I've
single-handedly raised

924
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,820
the unit price of
your ratings book.

925
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:22,792
Our ratings book price?
Whoa! (LAUGHS)

926
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,162
I'm a very fast learner.

927
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:28,164
We had a conversation
where I specifically
mentioned that.

928
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,366
Do you remember that?

929
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:31,734
Well, do you?

930
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:33,336
Yes.

931
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:35,504
I recently learned,
for instance,

932
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:38,666
that most Americans
watch local news
to stay informed.

933
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,144
I also learned that

934
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,679
the average half-hour
of Los Angeles
television news

935
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,082
packs all of its
local government coverage

936
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:48,284
including law enforcement,
budget, transportation,

937
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,986
education and immigration

938
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,954
into 22 seconds.
(CHUCKLES)

939
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:54,757
Local crime stories,
however, not only
usually led the news

940
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,425
but filled 14
times the broadcast,

941
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:57,994
averaging five minutes
and seven seconds.

942
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:01,263
KWLA relies heavily
on such stories.

943
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:02,999
With Los Angeles
crime rates going down,

944
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,135
I think that
makes items like mine
particularly valuable.

945
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:07,770
Like rare animals. (LAUGHS)

946
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,873
I can only imagine that
your needs will increase

947
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,195
during next month's
rating sweeps period.

948
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:16,045
Ooh!

949
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:17,713
(BOTH LAUGH)

950
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,282
Yeah.

951
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:22,718
Well, we certainly
appreciate what you do.

952
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,761
There's certain good things
about being alone.

953
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,866
You have time to do
the things you wanna do,

954
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,501
like study and plan,

955
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:39,535
but you can't have
dinners like this

956
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,970
or be physical with a person.

957
00:50:40,972 --> 00:50:43,132
I mean, outside
of flirtation-ship.

958
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:47,376
Where are you going with this?

959
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:50,880
I want that.

960
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:54,717
With you.

961
00:50:57,488 --> 00:51:00,768
Like you want to
keep your job and
your health insurance.

962
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,227
Look, just for starters,

963
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:08,931
I don't need you to
keep my fucking job.

964
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,767
You're the news director
on the vampire shift

965
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,137
of the lowest-rated
station in Los Angeles.

966
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:22,745
We have what could be
considered an
almost-exclusive relationship.

967
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,848
There are many
other places I could go.

968
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,684
I have to think
that you're invested
in this transaction.

969
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:29,752
WAITER: Here you are.

970
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:30,853
Wow.

971
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:32,695
WAITER: Enjoy.
Thank you.

972
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:40,396
Where did you get
the balls to even suggest
something like this?

973
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:41,864
We're still talking.

974
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:44,100
No. There's nothing
more to say.

975
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,434
You can leave.

976
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,909
Okay, look.

977
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:56,812
You've done well. Okay?

978
00:51:56,814 --> 00:52:00,316
And we pay you well,
very well.
We always have.

979
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,920
If you like,
I could get you
an exclusive retainer.

980
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:07,156
That would be on top
of your segment fees.

981
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,592
I could maybe even get
you a job at the station

982
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:11,227
starting as
a production assistant.

983
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,095
So that you could
learn the business
from the inside.

984
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,777
That's where you
said your interests lie.

985
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,232
Mmm-hmm.

986
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,928
You're not listening,
Nina.

987
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,004
I happen to know that you
haven't stayed at one station

988
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:23,939
for longer than
two years at a time,

989
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:26,181
and you're coming
up on two years soon.

990
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,179
I can imagine

991
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,514
that your contract is
for that length of time.

992
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:32,815
And that next month's ratings

993
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,350
directly affect that.

994
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:37,286
So, you're threatening
that if I don't...

995
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:38,654
I'm negotiating.

996
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,322
You're threatening
to stop selling to me.

997
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,525
That's your choice.

998
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:44,093
The true price of any item

999
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:45,695
is what somebody's
willing to pay for it.

1000
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,630
You want something.

1001
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,331
And I want you.

1002
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,699
To fuck you.

1003
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,369
And as a friend.

1004
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:56,105
Jesus Christ, friends
don't pressure friends

1005
00:52:56,107 --> 00:52:57,227
to fucking sleep with them.

1006
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,736
Actually,
that's not true, Nina.

1007
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,282
Because as I'm sure you know,

1008
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:10,019
a friend is a gift
you give yourself.

1009
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,920
RICK: Okay,
a left on Roth,

1010
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:46,422
and then six blocks to the ramp.

1011
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:47,823
You're putting me on the 5?

1012
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:50,259
Yeah, the 2 to the 5
to the 110 to the 10.

1013
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:52,895
Did you read my
traffic memo yesterday?

1014
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,897
Did I read it?

1015
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,398
Yeah, I read it.

1016
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,434
What did it say?

1017
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:00,236
About the 5?

1018
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,037
Okay. I looked at it.
What?

1019
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,405
Well, for one thing,
it included that

1020
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,740
the 5 has floating construction

1021
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,941
in the fast lane for
the next three weeks.

1022
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:07,876
So, given that,
I expect you to put me

1023
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:09,945
on the 2 to the 101
to the 110 to the 10.

1024
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:12,081
That's half of one,
six of the other.

1025
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,616
It's half dozen of one,
six of the other.

1026
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:14,783
What I'd like you
to do is admit that

1027
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,418
you didn't read
what you said you did.

1028
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,920
You know I'm
a reasonable person,

1029
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,588
but nobody likes to be lied to!

1030
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,757
Okay! When am I
going to get my raise?

1031
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,192
That's reasonable, right?

1032
00:54:23,194 --> 00:54:24,927
You keep talking
about this

Hello.
Hi.

1537
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,431
I'm Detective Frontieri.
This is my partner,
Detective Lieberman.

1538
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:31,599
Are you Louis Bloom?

1539
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:33,200
Yes, I'm Lou.

1540
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:35,236
You live here?
Yes, that's right.

1541
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:36,704
May we come inside?

1542
01:19:36,706 --> 01:19:37,972
Why?
FRONTIERI: Why not?

1543
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:40,207
You want to?
Yes.

1544
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:41,375
I don't care.
(CHUCKLES)

1545
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:42,543
Wonderful.

1546
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,650
You were in
Granada Hills last night.

1547
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:51,218
LOU: Yes, that's right.

1548
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,820
You shot the video in the house?

1549
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:55,122
Yes, ma'am, I did.
That's right.

1550
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:58,526
You went inside the house?
You filmed
all through the house?

1551
01:19:59,395 --> 01:20:00,635
You even filmed the bodies.

1552
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:02,730
All before the police came.

1553
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:03,731
That door was open, ma'am.

1554
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:05,132
Detective.

1555
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:08,068
The door was open
and what I did was

1556
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,470
I went in to see
if I could help,

1557
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,938
because the alarm was ringing.

1558
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,473
An active crime scene.

1559
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:13,915
I didn't know
it was a crime scene.

1560
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,911
LIEBERMAN:
You knew what it was.

1561
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:19,013
LOU: I know that
an alarm means
someone is in trouble.

1562
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:21,816

What did you see
when you arrived?

1565
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:28,355
Uh, two men
leaving in a vehicle.

1566
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:30,124
You saw two men?

1567
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,827
(STUTTERS) They were
just shapes, really.
I was afraid, so I hid.

1568
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:34,428
And then I saw
the shapes of two men

1569
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:36,630
moving inside the vehicle,
if that helps.

1570
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:37,932
Describe the men.

1571
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:39,200
LOU: It was dark.

1572
01:20:39,202 --> 01:20:41,001
And then they drove away.

1573
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,870
Black? White? Tall?
LOU: I couldn't see.

1574

LIEBERMAN:
What were they driving?

1575
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,272
An SUV.

1578
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:51,846
Maybe. Not that I saw.

1579
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:54,448
Do you have any film
on the men or the car?

1580
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,617
No, I don't. I only
started filming
when I was inside.

1581
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,485
FRONTIERI: Mmm-hmm.

1582
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:00,654
I'd like a copy of that footage.

Do I have to
give it to you?

Is there any reason
why you wouldn't?

1585

No, no, I made you a copy.

in the house
last night was alive.

I cut that part out.

1599
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:34,415
I also cut out the men
leaving in their car.

1600

I have a name and an address.
We're gonna drive there.

We're gonna find the person
that drove that car.

1602
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,056

who killed those people?

quite possibly, yes.

if he's actually inside.

2029
01:48:51,292 --> 01:48:53,325
and you're here voluntarily?

2030
01:48:53,327 --> 01:48:55,027
That's right. Yes.

2031
01:48:56,163 --> 01:48:58,998
And this is being
recorded and filmed?

2032
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,766
<i>Yes, from the camera up there.</i>

2033
01:49:01,469 --> 01:49:02,935
<i>Wide angle.</i>

2034
01:49:03,337 --> 01:49:04,370
Mmm-hmm.

2035
01:49:08,075 --> 01:49:09,808
Would you tell me
how it is you were

2036
01:49:09,810 --> 01:49:11,210
at the Chinatown Express tonight

2037
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:12,578
and called the 911?

2038
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,812
Of course.

2039
01:49:13,814 --> 01:49:15,614
It began earlier in the day.

2040
01:49:16,984 --> 01:49:18,984
I was watering my plant.

2041
01:49:20,187 --> 01:49:22,755
I looked out my window
at my apartment.

2042
01:49:22,757 --> 01:49:26,025
The one you visited.

2043
01:49:26,027 --> 01:49:29,228
I saw a dark-colored vehicle
with two men inside
parked across the street.

2044
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:30,329
I didn't think anything of it,

2045
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:31,971
otherwise I would have
reported it then.

2046
01:49:32,934 --> 01:49:34,633
We began our night,

2047
01:49:38,172 --> 01:49:41,006
my employee and myself.

2048
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:44,009
And around
approximately 12:38,

2049
01:49:44,011 --> 01:49:45,945
I looked in my rearview mirror

2050
01:49:45,947 --> 01:49:48,013
and I saw what looked
like the same men

2051
01:49:48,015 --> 01:49:50,182
in the same vehicle
following us.

2052
01:49:50,184 --> 01:49:51,684
I made an evasive maneuver.

2053
01:49:51,686 --> 01:49:54,687
I circled back
and tailed them
to the restaurant.

2054
01:49:54,689 --> 01:49:56,355
At which point,
I saw them go inside

2055
01:49:56,357 --> 01:49:59,124
and recognized them
as the same men
from the home invasion.

2056
01:50:00,127 --> 01:50:02,227
You told me
you didn't see the men.

2057
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:04,096
That you didn't get
a good look at them.

2058
01:50:04,098 --> 01:50:07,066
Well, it all came back to me
when I saw them going in.

2059
01:50:07,068 --> 01:50:10,536
Their shapes
and their movements.

2060
01:50:10,538 --> 01:50:13,072
And then I saw
that one of the men
had a gun under his shirt,

2061
01:50:13,074 --> 01:50:16,241
so I immediately
got my phone
and dialed 911.

2062
01:50:16,243 --> 01:50:17,876
That's your story?

2063
01:50:17,878 --> 01:50:20,045
That's what happened.
That's why
I'm sitting here with you.

2064
01:50:20,047 --> 01:50:22,481
I think that
the men saw my footage

2065
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:25,985
and they tracked me down.

2066
01:50:25,987 --> 01:50:28,268
You want to know
what I think?

2067
01:50:28,823 --> 01:50:31,323
Yes, please.

2068
01:50:31,325 --> 01:50:34,560
I think you withheld
information.

2069
01:50:34,562 --> 01:50:37,496
I think you saw the two men
in the murder house
in Granada Hills

2070
01:50:37,498 --> 01:50:41,734
and you saw the car
and you sat on it

2071
01:50:41,736 --> 01:50:44,103
to get something you could film.

2072
01:50:44,105 --> 01:50:46,265
What do you think about that?

2073
01:50:47,908 --> 01:50:50,109
I think that would be

2074
01:50:50,111 --> 01:50:52,911
a very unprofessional thing
for me to do in my business.

2075
01:50:52,913 --> 01:50:55,180
It would be murder.

2076
01:50:55,182 --> 01:50:56,582
I can understand why
you're looking into it,

2077
01:50:56,584 --> 01:50:58,117
but I didn't do
anything like that.

2078
01:50:58,119 --> 01:50:59,585
Nothing that could
be considered wrong.

2079
01:50:59,587 --> 01:51:01,086
You don't fool me for a minute.

2080
01:51:01,088 --> 01:51:03,088
I'm glad.

2081
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:06,525
I think everything
you said is a lie.

2082
01:51:06,527 --> 01:51:08,827
I wish my partner was here
to back up what happened.

2083
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:10,696
You left your dead partner.

2084
01:51:10,698 --> 01:51:11,964
No, the ambulances arrived.

2085
01:51:11,966 --> 01:51:13,532
They're trained professionals.

2086
01:51:13,534 --> 01:51:15,434
Yeah, and you seem
real broken up
about that.

2087
01:51:15,870 --> 01:51:17,503
No, um...

2088
01:51:17,505 --> 01:51:19,438
He died doing what he loved.

2089
01:51:20,975 --> 01:51:23,542
You filmed him dying.

2090
01:51:25,613 --> 01:51:27,680

It's my job.</i>

I can tell you from experience

2106
01:52:55,436 --> 01:52:58,437

up the ladder
is to listen carefully

2107

and follow my orders.

2108

But remember,
I will never ask you
to do anything

2110
01:53:10,384 --> 01:53:12,718
that I wouldn't do myself.
