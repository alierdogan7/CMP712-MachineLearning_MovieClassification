Six and a half minutes, Walter?

26

Well, three or four. Anyway, he set up the
whole picture with that one tracking shot.

He rubs against her wide, soft belly.

Slowly, he pushes her panties down to

her down onto the buckboard.

The client promises to get back to him.

- Does it have to be advertising?
- That's not the problem.

415

The account executive keeps waiting
for the client to call him back...

tell him if he got the job or not...

00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,721
You met Kahane at the Rialto.
You got drunk with him at a restaurant.

807
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:28,141
He left before you did.
That's the last time anyone saw him alive...

808
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,143
...except you maybe.

809
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,521
Why are you denying this?

810
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,733
Well, what do the police think?

811
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:40,987
They think it's a botched robbery.
You know...

812
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,823
...window of his car was busted.

813
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:46,159
He surprised someone
trying to take the radio.

814
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,703
There was a fight, he was killed.

815
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,997
I didn't kill him, Walter...

816
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,834
...but I went to see him.

817
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,336
I know I said I didn't, but I did.

818
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,090
- Why'd you lie to me?
- Well...

819
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,551
...now's not a very good time for me.

820
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,096
Haven't you heard the rumors?
I'm on my way out.

821
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,182
Just what I need,
a little more controversy.

822
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,976
Just not a good time, Walter.

823
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:13,979
Look.

824
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,191
I am in charge of studio security
in every definition of the word...

825
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,736
...which means it is my job
to take care of a studio executive...

826
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:25,657
...should he be, uh, shall we say,
under suspicion of murder...

827
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:29,703
...at a time when profits are down and
the company is vulnerable for a takeover.

828
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,998
It is my job to keep this
very, very, very, very quiet!

829
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,084
You wanna help?

830
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:39,379
- Of course.
- Then stop lying.

831
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,049
- How many meetings did you have?
- One.

832
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,886
- Not counting last night?
- Not counting last night.

833
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,221
Why'd you go all the way
to Pasadena to meet?

834
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:51,224
He had an idea I was interested in.
I wanted to talk to him.

835
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:52,559
His girlfriend.

836
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,896
I guess she was a friend of yours too.
Think fast!

837
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,732
Jesus Christ, Walter,
what do you think? What is this?

838
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,027
The third degree. If you don't like it,
wait till the police start asking.

839
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,154
- I'll go right now.
- They'll be a lot less polite!

840
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:07,949
- You come with me!
- You're acting like someone's who's guilty.

841
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,910
You're not guilty, are you?

842
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,245
For the last time, I'm not a murderer.

843
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,498
[FAX MACHINE BEEPS]

844
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,348
WALTER:
Bad news?

845
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,685
- What?
- The fax. Is it bad news?

846
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,062
No.

847
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,065
Business as usual.

848
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:45,153
PHIL: The Hollywood system
did not murder David Kahane.

849
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,615
Not the $98-million movie,
not the $12-million actor.

850
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:54,287
Not even the million-dollar deal
that David Kahane never landed.

851
00:47:54,455 --> 00:48:00,710
No, the most that we can pin on Hollywood
is assault with intent to kill.

852
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:06,091
Because society is responsible
for this particular murder...

853
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,888
...and it is to society that we must look
if we are to have any justice for that crime.

854
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,349
Because someone in the night...

855
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:19,813
...killed David Kahane, and that person
will have to bear the guilt.

856
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:26,903
And if David were here right now,
I know in my heart that he would say:

857
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,156
"Cut the shit, Phil.

858
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:34,369
What did you learn from all of this?
Did you learn anything from this?"

859
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,581
And I'd say,
"Uh, yeah, David, uh, I've learned a lot.

860
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,667
We here, uh... We'll take it from here."

861
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,838
And the next time we sell a script
for a million dollars...

862
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:48,508
...the next time we nail some
shit-bag producer to the wall, we'll say:

863
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,011
"That's another one for David Kahane."

864
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,935
David was working on something the day
he died. I'd, uh, like to share it with you.

865
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,856
"Blackness. A mangy dog barks.

866
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:08,653
Garbage can lids are lifted
as derelicts in the street hunt for food.

867
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,281
Buzzing, as a cheap alarm clock
goes off.

868
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,784
Interior. Flophouse room. Early morning.

869
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:18,038
A tracking shot moves
through the grimy room.

870
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,750
Light streams in through holes
in the yellowing window shades.

871
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,544
Moths dance in the beams of light.

872
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:27,881
Track down along the floor.
The frayed rug.

873
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,925
Stop on an old shoe.

874
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,802
It's empty."

875
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,225
That's as far as he got.

876
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,729
That's the last thing he wrote.

877
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,607
So long, Dave.

878
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,942
Fade out.

879
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:49,903
Thank you.

880
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:09,422
Who are you? You're not a writer.

881
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,592
No. I'm Griffin Mill.

882
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:17,430
- We spoke the night David was...
- Blue sea, white sea. Yes.

883
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,182
It turned out you were right.

884
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,143
- What?
- It was a red sea.

885
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,105
Oh. Yeah.

886
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,359
You're the only person I know here.

887
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,654
Listen, I'm really sorry about David.

888
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,739
He was, uh...

889
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,908
...a talent.

890
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,285
You really think so?

891
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,330
I always suspected he was...

892
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:46,042
...uniquely untalented.

893
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,294
It's nice of you to say that.

894
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,756
- Nice of you to come. You didn't have to.
GRIFFIN: Well, I did.

895
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:55,802
You know, I was probably
the last person to see him alive.

896
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,346
Yeah. The police told me.

897
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:02,392
- Well, not quite the last, surely.
- No.

898
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,980
I'm sure this is a terrible time for you.

899
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,357
Is there anything you need or?

900
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,776
No, really. I...

901
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,195
I don't feel bad.

902
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,157
It's like when my parents died.

903
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:21,578
I didn't feel anything at all.
They were just gone.

904
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,707
Well, I'm sure it hasn't sunk in yet.

905
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,169
- That was years ago.
- No, I meant David.

906
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,587
Oh.

907
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,213
Oh, God.

908
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,425
These people. I don't like it here.

909
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:41,848
They're all expecting me to grieve
and mourn, and I can't talk to them.

910
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,518
David's gone...

911
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,188
...and I'm somewhere else already.

912
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,316
- Will you take me home?
- What?

913
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:53,443
Will you take me home?

914
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,238
Sure. I'm right here.

915
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,402
These are very interesting. I like them.

916
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,240
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

917
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,617
- Where do you show?
- Hmm?

918
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:43,910
Gallery. What gallery?

919
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,746
- Who's your dealer?
- I don't have a dealer.

920
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,290
I couldn't sell these.
They're never finished.

921
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,084
Bicky?

922
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,379
No, thanks. They're never finished?

923
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,883
No, they're just what I do, for myself.

924
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,927
What I feel.

925
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,430
You ask lots of questions, Mr. Mill.

926
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:08,935
You're just like the police.
That's all they did, ask questions.

927
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,771
They asked me a lot about you.

928
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,731
- Did they?
- Mm-hm.

929
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:17,569
How long we've known each other,
if you'd ever been to the house before.

930
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,655
Well, I suppose they have to ask
those questions.

931
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,615
I don't see why.

932
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,285
Because that's what police do.

933
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,705
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

934
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,666
Why was it so important
to see David that night?

935
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,793
What was so urgent?

936
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,548
Well, he pitched me a story
a few months ago and...

937
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,925
- The Japan story, right?
- Yes, the Japan story.

938
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:44,804
I liked it at the time, but it needed work,
especially the ending.

939
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,473
And I was sitting in my office that day...

940
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,518
...and it suddenly occurred to me
how to make the ending work.

941
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,812
So, what was it?

942
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:56,649
- What?
- Your idea for the ending?

943
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,985
Up.

944
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,195
- "Up"?
- Up.

945
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,365
- What does that mean?
- As opposed to down. Moods.

946
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,827
You know, happy as opposed to sad,
hopeful as opposed to depressing.

947
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,664
- What did you think of his ending?
- I never read it.

948
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,169
- You never read it?
- Nope.

949
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,379
I don't like reading.

950
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,758
- Do you like books?
- I like words...

951
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,676
...and letters...

952
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,262
...but I'm not crazy
about complete sentences.

953
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,014
Hmm.

954
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,891
So, what did he think?

955
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:34,395
He walked out on me, actually.
I don't think David liked me very much.

956
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:39,108
I think he just didn't like happy endings.

957
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,364
Put your face here.

958
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,533
Great.

959
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,913
What are you doing?
You're not gonna paint me, are you?

960
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:55,249
I might put you in one of my paintings.

961
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,878
There's one that I want to do
of an Icelandic hero.

962
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:02,131
He's a thief and he's made of fire.

963
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:04,717
- Hmm, but you might not like that.
- Why not?

964
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,471
Because you're in the movies...

965
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,557
...and in the movies, you can't
have thieves as heroes, can you?

966
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:15,687
I don't know about that. We have
a long tradition of gangsters in the movies.

967
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,065
Oh, yes, but they always have to
suffer for their crimes, don't they?

968
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,735
We should pay for our crimes,
shouldn't we?

969
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:27,532
I don't know. Knowing that you've
committed a crime is suffering enough.

970
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:32,578
If you don't suffer,
maybe it wasn't a crime after all.

971
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,581
Anyway, what difference does it make?

972
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:38,918
It has nothing to do

01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,394
Yes, I guess I am.

1294
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,772
I guess I am.

1295
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:58,243
I wanna make love to you.

1296
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:01,246
It's too soon.

1297
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,793
It's too soon, isn't it?

1298
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,339
It's so strange how things happen.

1299
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,427
David was here...

1300
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,679
...then he left.

1301
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:20,807
You arrived.

1302
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:25,979
Maybe it's just the timing,
but I feel like...

1303
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:29,733
...I would go anywhere with you...

1304
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,944
...if you asked.

1305
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,950
But we mustn't hurry things.

1306
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:45,081
You know, we can't hurry things
any more than we can stop them.

1307
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,586
I think you better go now.

1308
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:52,339
I think I'm going to cry now.

1309
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,346
Better go, quick.

1310
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,937
I'm sorry.

1311
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:10,482
No, no, no, don't be sorry.
Just go home...

1312
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,235
...and get some sleep...

1313
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:15,570
...and call me.

1314
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,156
Tomorrow.

1315
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,910
Invite me on a proper date.

1316
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,871
I'd like that.

1317

GRIFFIN [OVER INTERCOM]:
Jan?

1318
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:42,681
- Jan!
JAN: Yeah?

1319
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,307
GRIFFIN:
Get Larry Levy on the phone.

1320
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:47,269
JAN: I don't think he's on the lot.
GRIFFIN: Try his car.

1321
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,145
Isn't he at Fox?

1322
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:51,356
He used to be. Not anymore.

1323
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,818
I pitched him something a few months ago
and he hated it.

1324
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,445
LEVY [OVER SPEAKER]: Yeah, Griffin.
- Yeah, yeah.

1325
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,072
Listen, I've got Tom Oakley...

1326
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,033
...and Andy Civella.
I wouldn't be bothering you if I didn't...

1327
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:04,202
...think they had an idea
you should hear.

1328
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,788
- Hi, guys.
CIVELLA: Hi, Larry.

1329
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:09,791
Uh, the next voice you're gonna hear
has got an English accent.

1330
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:11,835
Tom Oakley. I'm Andy Civella.

1331
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,504
Hi, Andy. I know Tom.
How are you, Tom?

1332
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:16,673
Uh, very well, Larry. And yourself?

1333
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,842
Fine. What's your story?

1334
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:22,637
We open outside San Quentin. It's night.

1335
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,055
[MIMICS RAIN]

1336
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:27,183
It's raining.
A limousine enters through the front gate...

1337
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:31,521
...past a tight knot of demonstrators holding
a candlelight vigil. The candles are...

1338
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:34,899
...flickering underneath the umbrellas,
glowing like Japanese lanterns.

1339
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:38,695
A lone demonstrator, black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

1340
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,239
Her eyes connect
with the lone passenger.

1341
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:45,910
It's a devastating moment
for both of them. Incredibly potent.

1342
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,416
No stars, no Schwarzenegger,
no pat Hollywood endings...

1343
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:54,711
...no car chases.
This is an American tragedy...

1344
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,880
...in which an innocent woman dies.

1345
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:00,759
Because that happens. That's reality.

1346
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,095
LEVY [OVER SPEAKER]:
Take me off the speakerphone, Griffin.

1347
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:06,514
Yeah?

1348
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:11,227
I don't know. It's a really hot story,
but what is this bullshit, no stars?

1349
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:15,273
Let me give you a little tip, Larry.
Levison came to power on two movies.

1350
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,734
They made $300 million
and had no stars in them.

1351
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:20,362
He's gonna love this idea.
It'll remind him of his youth.

1352
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:23,573
You know what his motto used to be?
No stars, just talent.

1353
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:27,494
- Has anyone else heard this?
GRIFFIN: I don't think so. No.

1354
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:29,579
We should make a deal now.

1355
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,707
Tomorrow may be too late.
Can we get ahold of Levison?

1356
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:35,293
Yeah, I'll get Levison.
Uh, when can you be back?

1357
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:38,004
- I'll be there right after my AA meeting.
- Oh, Larry.

1358
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,548
I didn't realize you, uh,
had a drinking problem.

1359
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:41,925
LEVY:
Well...

1360
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:46,638
...I don't really, but that's where all the
deals are being made these days. See you.

1361
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:51,768
Tom, that was a hell of a pitch.

1362
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,105
Good work. I think you sold Larry.

1363
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,482
CIVELLA:
Great. When are we gonna hear?

1364
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:00,151
I want you to go home,
put some champagne on ice.

1365
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,986
I'll give you an answer by tonight.

1366
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:05,782
- Jan, come in here.
- Griffin, you move in mysterious ways...

1367
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,660
...but I like it. I like it.
- Okay.

1368
01:19:08,828 --> 01:19:10,620
Did Levy understand? No stars?

1369
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:13,248
Yes, he was particularly attracted
to that notion.

1370
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:16,251
- No Hollywood ending?
- No Hollywood ending.

1371
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,672
They looked happy.

1372
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:23,925
They have a completely fucked-up idea
that has no second act.

1373
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,845
If I hadn't heard it myself,
I never would have believed it.

1374
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:30,181
Larry Levy liked it
because he's a dick-brain.

1375
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,517
Levy will sell the idea to Levison...

1376
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:35,270
...and then I will let Levison
have the brilliant idea...

1377
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:38,606
...of letting Larry
take over the project for me.

1378
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:39,983
You will?

1379
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:42,944
See, Levison can't wait
to get in bed with Levy.

1380
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:47,282
This piece-of-shit idea
will blow up in both their faces.

1381
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:51,703
And then I will step in and save the day.

The DA discovers that
the husband faked his own death.

01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:12,724
She's innocent. He races to
the penitentiary, but it's too late.

01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:15,226
The pellets have dropped. She's dead.

What kind of ending do you call that?
It's depressing. It'll bring everybody down.

Depressing? Joel, what about

Three hundred nineteen million dollars.
There wasn't a dry eye in the house.

1397
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:39,250
- Depressing? I don't think so.
- Yeah, but...

1398
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:42,128
Normally I'd agree,
but this is an entirely different deal.

1399
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:44,339
It is a matter of taking a risk.

Rolling the dice.

- Do they screw?
- Who?

01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:57,560
The DA, whoever it is, and the woman.
Do they screw?

this thing?

That was the most amazing pitch
I've ever heard.

your project like that.

Well, I do use jumbo. These are not mine.

01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:29,710
God. Just trying to help you out.

1616
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:33,505
Um, look, did you see this guy
the night of the murder?

1617
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,219
Sorry, ha, ha. Um...

1618
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,972
No. Uh, you're putting me
in a terrible position here.

1619
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,016
I would hate to get
the wrong person arrested.

1620
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:47,436
Oh, please. This is Pasadena.
We do not arrest the wrong person.

1621
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:50,773
That's L.A. See, L.A., they kick
your ass and then they arrest you.

1622
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:53,609
That's what they do. We don't do that.
Remember last year?

1623
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:56,153
What was that guy's name?
They put him on the tape.

1624
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:57,655
- King.
AVERY: That's right, King.

1625
01:32:57,864 --> 01:33:00,074
DELIVERY MAN: BLT.
- He was the wrong guy.

1626
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:06,080
- Do you have a witness?
- Now, I can't answer that.

1627
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:10,417
Well, either you have a witness
or these are suspects in similar murders.

1628
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:12,836
Mr. Mill, have you been going
to detective school?

1629
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:17,424
No, actually, we're doing a movie right
now called The Lonely Room. Scott Glenn...

1630
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:20,010
...plays a detective like you.
- Is he a black woman?

1631
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:21,553
GRIFFIN: No.
- Don't give me turkey.

1632
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:25,391
- Lily Tomlin's in that? I heard about that.
- Actually I was drawing a comparison...

1633
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,102
...not based on race or gender.

1634
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:33,023
Speaking of which,
did you go out with, uh, June, uh...?

1635
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,109
What is that woman's name?

1636
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:37,611
Gudmundsdottir.

1637
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:41,949

Well, that really helps.

1640
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,622
Could you...?
Uh, did you go out with June...?

1641
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,708
GRIFFIN: Gudmundsdottir.
- Yeah. Her. Last night?

1642
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,167
Yes, I did.

01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,169
You guys known each other
a long time?

1644
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:57,381
No, I spoke to her for the first time
the night Kahane was killed.

1645
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:58,757
Wow.

1646
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:00,884
- So you didn't know her before this?
- No.

1647
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:02,720
We met over the phone.

1648
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,888
We got to talking,
one thing led to another.

1649
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:06,890
You fuck her?

1650
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:11,729
- What kind of question is that?
- I think it's pretty direct. Did you fuck her?

1651
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:15,357
I wouldn't answer that question
without a lawyer in the room.

1652
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,901
Then I probably wouldn't
even answer that question.

1653
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,529
Why don't you ask your friend?
He's been following me.

1654
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:22,823
- He'll probably know.
- All right.

1655
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:28,078
Paul, did Mr. Mill
fuck June Hudmuuhunta?

1656
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:29,538
I didn't see him.

1657
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:32,499
- Got away with it. He didn't see you.
- What are you implying?

1658
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:35,753
I'm not implying. I asked a direct question.
Did you fuck her?

1659
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:38,255
I told you I wouldn't answer that
without a lawyer.

1660
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:41,258
- Why you getting hot under the collar?
- You're being rude.

1661
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:42,593
Oh, well, excuse me.

1662
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:46,764
But I think it's kind of soon for her
to be gallivanting in the streets with you.

1663
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:49,224
I'm there for her as a friend, Miss Avery.

1664
01:34:49,392 --> 01:34:51,560
- Mm.
- Why don't you call her?

1665
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:54,938
I'm sure she'll be happy to pick over
the horror of what's happened...

1666
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:58,567
...and tell you how we became friends.

What is this, fucking Iran?

1668
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:04,198
Since when does the state tell us how long,
and with whom we can share our grief?

to get yourself a real good lawyer.

01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:47,741
I had a drink with the guy, Walter.
That's all.

If you went to Pasadena with the intent
to kill, you could go to the gas chamber.

He grabbed the phone from me.

- I'm going to Puerto Vallarta.

1692
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:21,024
Because Larry Levy
could have my office in three days.
