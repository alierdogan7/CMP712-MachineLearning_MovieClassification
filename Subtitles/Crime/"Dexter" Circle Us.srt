00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:03,611
bodily orifices,
becoming congealed

184
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:05,379
once they came in contact
with the formalin.

185
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:06,614
That's what's on your shoe.

186
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:10,584
Congealed organ.

187
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:11,919
What kind of sick fuck
are we dealing with?

188
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:14,588
I'm just the blood guy.

189
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:16,123
We've got five victims.

190
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:18,526
All female, all blonde,

191
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,028
all between the ages
of 20 and 35, I'm guessing.

192
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:23,931
They're covered in bruises,
contusions, whip marks.

193
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:27,168
Looks like they went through
some special kind of hell.

194
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:28,869
We'll get fingerprints off them
once we get 'em

195
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,471
to the M.E.'s office.

196
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:32,073
I heard the driver took off.

197
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:33,641
Yeah, we've got the guy
that hit him.

198
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,309
He was drunk off his
freaking ass.

199
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:37,645
He said he saw some guy
jump out and start running,

200
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,780
but that's as detailed
as his description gets.

201
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:40,948
"Some guy."

202
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:44,418
That means he's still mine
to find.

203
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:50,758
Or Vince Masuka's.

204
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:51,959
Hey.

205
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:55,896
Hey, Dex.

206
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:57,765
That's some pretty crazy shit,
huh?

207
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,834
Yeah, crazy shit.
What do you got?

208
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:03,104
Uh...

209
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:07,041
One men's suit jacket, size 40.

210
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:09,610
Did you fold it
or was it already like that?

211
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:12,913
I bagged it as I found it.

212
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:14,682
I also got fingerprints galore.

213
00:13:14,716 --> 00:13:16,183
Excellent.

214
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:17,651
Except for the steering wheel.

215
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,387
Somebody gave it a quick wipe.

216
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:21,222
I'll get the vehicle back
to the lab

217
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:23,190
and we'll give it a more
thorough going-over.

218
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:25,192
Right.

219
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:36,036
So much for keeping
my lives separate.

220
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,507
[Cell phone vibrates]

221
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,108
[Keypad tone]
Yeah, what's up?

222
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:42,910
What you doing, boy?
Sleeping late?

223
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,545
Your buddy Dexter Morgan,
you asked me

224
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,313
- to keep an eye on him.
- Yeah?

225
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:47,748
And?

226
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,350
Well, he's got some cutie up
at his house.

227
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:51,018
He even took down
the "for sale" sign.

228
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:53,187
What's this girl look like?

229
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:55,256
Blonde, average height,
late 20s.

230
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,991
Slim, pretty?

231
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,526
That'd be her.

232
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,693
Find out who she is.

233
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,295
You betcha.
[Keypad tone]

234
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:02,696
Come here.

235
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:03,898
What are you doing here?

236
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:05,733
I saw the news.

237
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,301
I knew what it was.
I had to come.

238
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:08,569
No, you didn't have to come.

239
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:11,172
Dexter, I was supposed
to be one of those girls.

240
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:13,274
Look, it's not safe
for you here.

241
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:14,508
They could be watching.

242
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:17,178
What is this?

243
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:18,179
What does it mean?

244
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:20,080
It means they're on the run.

245
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:22,049
You need to go.

246
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:35,396
Will you give me...
Thank you.

247
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:45,139
Shit a brick
and fuck me with it.

248
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:48,676
You're never gonna guess who
this truck is registered to.

249
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,712
Jordan Chase.

250
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:56,750
Jordan Chase
is a very smart guy.

251
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,953
His first book made me realize

252
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,722
how I'd been putting all these
limitations on myself.

253
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:05,092
I mean, I've listened
to all his CDs.

254
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:06,894
So did Boyd Fowler.

255
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:09,463
You think Jordan could have been
driving that truck?

256
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:10,531
What?

257
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:12,166
No way.

258
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,702
First off, that jacket is nice,

259
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,537
but not that nice.

260
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:18,906
Jordan wears nothing
but the best.

261
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,908
That's part of his thing.

262
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,110
If you think you deserve
something,

263
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:27,982
then take it.

264
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:29,250
[Sighs]

265
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:31,151
I've lifted two dozen
fingerprints

266
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:33,921
and they all seem to belong
to the same person.

267
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:35,890
[Sighs]
And whoever they belong to,

268
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:39,226
he's not in the AFIS database.

269
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:42,096
Dead end.

270
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,132
Ooh, a hair.

271
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:53,073
And another one.

272
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:55,809
[Chuckles]

273
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:59,113
It's not often I'm in
competition with my own people,

274
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:01,315
but getting the identity
of the driver of the truck

275
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,117
and getting to him
before they do

276
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,386
is the only way I can give Lumen
what I promised.

277
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:12,793
All I get
is a fucking computer.

278
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,461
I can order Jordan Chase books.

279
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:16,030
I can order Jordan Chase CDs,

280
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:19,199
but I can't talk
to an actual person.

281
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,535
Jordan Chase is a really
popular man, you know?

282
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,737
He travels the world
giving his little

283
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,039
touchy-feely seminars.

284
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:26,874
He's probably not even
in Miami right now.

285
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:28,475
I've left messages all over.

286
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,210
If I don't hear back soon,
I'm gonna kick their door in.

287
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,913
What about you?
Anything?

288
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,582
Yeah, we've I.D.'d two
of the girls

289
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,584
off their fingerprints.

290
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:38,686
One was a schoolteacher
from Wisconsin.

291
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,821
She came out here on vacation
two years ago.

292
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,222
Never heard from again.

293
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:45,159
The other one worked on a cruise
ship that was docked here.

294
00:16:45,193 --> 00:16:47,161
She disappeared
just over a year ago.

295
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:48,629
Wow.

296
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:51,065
Yeah, these were good girls,
you know?

297
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,467
One was 26, one was 29.

298
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,002
Nothing on the other three?

299
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:57,838
No, I'm going through
the missing person databases.

300
00:16:57,872 --> 00:16:59,340
Put their
photographs out there.

301
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:00,708
DNA?

302
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:02,242
It's being run now.

303
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:04,511
Looking for direct hits
and familial hits.

304
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,046
Listen.

305
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:08,349
I heard about this two-bedroom
place on Brickell.

306
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,050
Upper unit, right on the water.

307
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:11,552
Thought we could take a look.

308
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:12,920
This is not a workplace
conversation,

309
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:14,388
so please just shut up.

310
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:16,757
All I'm saying is,
is this place is going fast.

311
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,459
Listen, please, just not here.

312
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,928
You two...

313
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:23,430
Now.

314
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,469
Shit.

315
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,437
Think she knows about us?

316
00:17:38,546 --> 00:17:39,680
Is this about...

317
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:40,681
The Santa Muerte case.

318
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:42,750
Oh.

319
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,018
I thought that was dead.

320
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:46,987
Well, now it's alive.
Barely.

321
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:50,691
Yasmin Aragon, the associate
of the Fuentes brothers

322
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:52,926
that sergeant Batista
identified,

323
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:55,162
has assured us that
she will bring

324
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,364
Carlos and Marco into Club Mayan
tomorrow night.

325
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:59,199
- So we're on?
- We are on.

326
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,635
I am personally overseeing
this operation.

327
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,837
We can't risk word leaking out
to the Fuentes,

328
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:06,073
so it's strictly
on a need-to-know basis.

329
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:09,076
Rather than flooding
the club with police personnel,

330
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,046
we will be performing
a small surgical operation.

331
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,781
We will take the brothers
into custody

332
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:15,049
before they get into the club.

333
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,517
Detective Morgan,
you'll be with me

334
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:18,218
in the surveillance van.

335
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:20,220
Detective Quinn,
we're gonna post you

336
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:22,656
inside the door of the club
with officer Manzon.

337
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:23,924
I will be roving,
placing myself

338
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,626
wherever I believe
most effective.

339
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,461
If we're gonna
take them outside,

340
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:30,097
shouldn't we be outside?

341
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:32,533
In order not to stand out
like sore thumbs,

342
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:35,169
we will continue with the posts
we've already established.

343
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:37,171
Thank you,
detectives Morgan and Quinn.

344
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,474
That'll be all.

345
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:42,843
Maria...

346
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:46,280
Let me make myself very clear.

347
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,782
You've wasted more than enough
time and money

348
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:50,951
on this case already.

349
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:53,520
You're supposed to be a master
manipulator of the press,

350
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:54,988
but you haven't even been able
to do that.

351
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:57,091
Every day I pick up the paper,
read another story

352
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,126
about how we're not
doing our job.

353
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,328
Get it right this time

354
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:03,330
or we're gonna have an
interesting conversation

355
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:07,768
about your future.

356
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:11,839
[Sighs]

357
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:16,510
Where are we with Jordan Chase?

358
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:19,246
I've got Quinn on it.

359
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,482
We've made numerous calls
to his organization,

360
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:24,418
but we haven't been able to
reach him personally just yet.

361
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:26,220
He could be
playing hard to get.

362
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:27,821
[Elevator bell rings]
In that case,

363
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,556
we'll pay his office a visit
to see if, uh...

364
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:32,559
Probably won't be necessary.

365
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,365
Jordan Chase.

366
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,100
Uh, hi.

367
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,472
Holy shit.
That's him.

368
00:19:45,507 --> 00:19:48,509
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

369
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:51,411
You too.

370
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:54,081
Mr. Chase?
Oh, Mr. Chase.

371
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:55,482
- Stand back.
- I, um... I, uh...

372
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:57,084
I took one of your seminars
at the beach club

373
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:58,552
a while back.

374
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,087
Sure.
In Palmetto Bay?

375
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:01,522
You remember?

376
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:03,157
Of course I do.

377
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:04,591
You have to excuse Cole here.

378
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,493
He, uh... he keeps
the crazies away.

379
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:09,163
Why don't you let me get
a picture of you two?

380
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:11,598
Oh, yeah.
Excellent. Okay.

381
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,234
- Okay.
- All right.

382
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:16,236
Smile.
[Camera clicks]

383
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:17,437
Uh, one more.

384
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:19,206
[Camera clicks]

385
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,440
Got it.

386
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:22,409
Jordan Chase.

387
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:25,078
Dexter Morgan.

388
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:26,079
Nice to meet you.

389
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:27,414
Wow.
Nice watch.

390
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,516
Oh, uh, my dad gave it to me

391
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:30,851
when I was a teenager.

392
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:33,787
It's water-resistant
to 100 meters.

393
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:35,689
I have no idea why
I would ever need that,

394
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:37,090
but it sure looks nice.

395
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,492
If that's the watch
that Lumen heard,

396
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:39,827
I'll make sure it
accompanies you

397
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,963
to the bottom of the Atlantic.

398
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:44,298
Mr. Chase.

399
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:47,568
You must be the person
in charge around here.

400
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:49,303
I was in Jacksonville.

401
00:20:49,337 --> 00:20:50,904
Got an early call
from Cole here,

402
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,973
my head of security,
saying that one of our trucks

403
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:54,374
had been stolen out of our lot

404
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:55,809
and that it just might
be the one

405
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:58,212
we'd all been watching
on the news.

406
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,546
I flew back as soon as I could.

407
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:01,715
I see.

408
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:04,585
We found an article
of clothing in the vehicle.

409
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:07,187
My jacket.
It's my personal vehicle.

410
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:09,656
I always leave
my things inside.

411
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:11,458
- And the keys?
- The keys?

412
00:21:11,492 --> 00:21:13,727
Yeah, we found the keys
in the ignition.

413
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:16,763
There are a lot of ways
to steal a car.

414
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:19,066
Most thieves don't
have the actual key.

415
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,504
I leave a spare set of keys
on a hook inside our office.

416
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,006
All my guys know where
to find them

417
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,608
in case they need the truck.

418
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:29,476
Honestly,
they're just sitting there.

419
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,378
Anyone could have grabbed them.

420
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:33,013
And you're head of security?

421
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,015
[Scoffs] Yeah, Cole.

422
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:38,518
I might have to tighten things
up a bit, hmm?

423
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:40,654
[Sighs]

424
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:43,190
I want to make it very clear
that the Miami Police Department

425
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:44,825
has my full cooperation.

426
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,761
My organization is completely
open to you.

427
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:50,664
This is a horrible,
horrible tragedy.

428
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,766
Please, anything I can do
to help facilitate

429
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,201
its resolution.

430
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:55,502
Well, thank you, Mr. Chase.

431
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:57,004
First, we're gonna need
fingerprints

432
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,240
and hair samples
from all your employees.

433
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:01,708
Starting with Cole.

434
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:03,043
Absolutely.

435
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:04,912
And if I could ask one favor?

436
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:06,847
I'd appreciate it if my name
and organization

437
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:09,983
wasn't released to the press.

438
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:13,420
Being connected to this in any
way would be a P.R. nightmare.

439
00:22:13,454 --> 00:22:15,389
I'm sure you understand.

440
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:17,591
As long as we have your
continued cooperation,

441
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,160
that shouldn't be a problem.

442
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:22,596
Sociopaths can't feel
psychic pain,

443
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,231
but they can feel
physical pain.

444
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:25,699
Ow.

445
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,368
Sorry.

446
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,241
What do you think about Cole?

447
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,710
"It wasn't me.

448
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:40,747
Someone stole my vehicle."

449
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:43,383
The oldest excuse in the book.

450
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:44,685
Still, it does happen.

451
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:48,288
And Mr. Chase
is very high-profile,

452
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:51,158
well respected.

453
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:52,693
It's hard to imagine
someone like him

454
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:56,029
or his people would be involved
in something like this.

455
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:04,171
I took a few hairs
from the headrest

456
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:06,406
of the truck as well.

457
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:07,741
If someone else was driving,

458
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:09,209
he'd have left some
evidence behind.

459
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,777
And?

460
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:12,779
Well, Cole's hair
matches the hair

461
00:23:12,814 --> 00:23:14,414
on the jacket and the headrest.

462
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:15,983
- Fingerprints?
- They're all Cole's.

463
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:17,951
Even on the ignition key.

464
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:18,986
I think he's just
become the focus

465
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,487
of our investigation.

466
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,456
And Jordan?

467
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,858
His alibi holds up.
He was in Jacksonville.

468
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:29,763
So for now,
we got our eyes on Cole.

469
00:23:47,415 --> 00:23:48,582
Lumen?

470
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:51,184
Dexter, you need
to announce yourself.

471
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:53,120
I don't know who's coming in.

472
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:56,490
But it's okay to have packages
delivered here?

[Package thuds]

474
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:01,495
I need things.

475
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:04,498
You said not
to leave the house.

476
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:13,640
And what are you gonna
do with that?

477
00:24:13,674 --> 00:24:17,878
It's just a flashlight.

478
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:21,515
You have a way
of bending the rules.

479
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,188
What's going on with the case?

480
00:24:28,222 --> 00:24:29,790
[Keypad tones]

481
00:24:29,824 --> 00:24:33,026
Do you know this man?

482
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:36,897
Oh, my God.

483
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:39,633
That's him.

484
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,535
That's the guy
who folded his jacket.

485
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,203
How did you find him?

486
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:44,704
He found us.

487
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:46,206
His name's Cole Harmon.

488
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,711
He's Jordan Chase's
head of security.

489
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:55,715
[Keypad tone] What about him?

490
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,717
[Sighs]
No, I...

491
00:24:57,752 --> 00:24:59,086
I mean, that guy's
clearly a freak,

492
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,254
but I don't know him.

493
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:03,457
No, not the bald guy.
The guy beside him.

495
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,762
Oh.

496
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,730
- No, I don't know him either.
- You sure?

497
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:12,566
I told you, I didn't see
most of their faces.

499
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:16,903
Who is he?

500
00:25:16,938 --> 00:25:20,674
He's some sort
of motivational speaker.

501
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:25,412
This guy...
I definitely know.

502
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:26,880
What next?

503
00:25:26,914 --> 00:25:29,182
Well, there's a problem.
The homicide team is on this.

504
00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:31,785
They'll probably arrest him
within the next few days

505
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:33,687
and once that happens,
Cole will never see

506
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:36,189
the outside
of a prison cell again.

507
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:38,525
What about the other guys?

508
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,696
In order to save his own skin,
he'll probably turn them in.

509
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,764
It's only a matter of time
before they're all

510
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,734
in the hands of the police.

511
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:54,574
But this is Florida.
We execute here.

512
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:58,912
These men will be brought
to justice.

513
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:00,180
You can walk away
from all of this now,

514
00:26:00,214 --> 00:26:02,382
put it behind you.

515
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,985
You can go on with your life.

516
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:07,120
No.

517
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:08,455
That's not what I want.

I promise you the police
will take care of it.

No, I don't want the police
to take care of it.

are you drinking?

for me at night?

without putting someone
on my table.

You said you'd help me.

531
00:26:38,452 --> 00:26:39,686
I did.

532
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,987
I just don't know
that helping you

533
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:43,056
kill someone
is actually helping you.

540
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:03,410
[Sighs]

541
00:27:03,444 --> 00:27:06,580
For some very complicated
reasons.

542
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:10,250
If we want Cole for ourselves,

543
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:15,253
I have to derail the police investigation,
which means giving them another suspect.

544
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,791
who?

545
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:21,027
The man who actually killed
all those girls.

546
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:23,496
Boyd Fowler.

547
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,389
Here.
Put these on.

548
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:51,524
First thing we have to do
is remove any evidence

549
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,360
that you were ever here
at Boyd's house.

550
00:27:53,394 --> 00:27:57,998
If police find
your fingerprints or...

551
00:27:58,032 --> 00:28:00,200
Anything that ties you
to this place,

552
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:02,035
they're gonna want to know
what your relationship

553
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:03,870
to Boyd Fowler is.

554
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:06,640
How you got here.

555
00:28:06,674 --> 00:28:10,910
How you got out.

556
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:15,148
That's where you
first found me.

557
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:20,186
We need to go up.

558
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:23,323
You okay?

559
00:28:23,357 --> 00:28:26,326
I'll be with you.

560
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:42,676
[Breathes sharply]

561
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,346
Oh, God.

562
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,683
You okay?
We can leave.

563
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:54,354
No.

564
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:57,657
He kept me tied up...
Over there.

565
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:06,333
I don't know how long
I was here.

566
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,668
Maybe a couple days.

567
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:12,806
All I know is that he brought me
here to kill me.

568
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,010
I'm guessing that was his job.

569
00:29:17,044 --> 00:29:19,579
He was the finisher.

570
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:27,687
The last day,
I chewed on that rope for hours.

571
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,222
I was finally able
to slip it off.

572
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:32,325
That's when I went downstairs
and I saw you...

573
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:40,066
...Do what I did.

574
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:42,068
[Exhales sharply]

575
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:57,150
Is that it?

576
00:29:57,184 --> 00:29:58,385
Yeah.

577
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:00,120
I just need something
of Boyd's to plant

578
00:30:00,154 --> 00:30:03,056
in the truck from the accident.

579
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:07,727
His wallet.

580
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,763
How did you know
that was there?

581
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:12,031
I put it there.

582
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:15,235
Hold the fucking phone,
everyone!

583
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:17,103
I was giving Cole's truck
another quick once-over

584
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:20,006
and I found something that our
blind-as-fucking-bats

585
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,341
lab geeks missed.

586
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,010
- What have you got?
- A wallet.

587
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:26,746
He probably had it sitting
on the console and then

588
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,348
it went flying when he got hit.

589
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:30,517
- I found it under the seat.
- Cole's wallet?

590
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:32,452
No, that's just it.
It's not Cole's.

591
00:30:32,486 --> 00:30:34,354
Whose is it?

592
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:37,791
Boyd Fowler's.

593
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:41,428
Who the fuck is Boyd Fowler?

594
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:42,862
[Indistinct radio chatter]

595
00:30:42,897 --> 00:30:48,568
I'm going upstairs.

596
00:30:48,602 --> 00:30:50,637
Check it out.

597
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:53,239
There are locks of hair in here

598
00:30:53,274 --> 00:30:54,541
numbered 1 through 12.

599
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:55,775
12?

600
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,544
Jesus.

601
00:30:57,578 --> 00:31:01,581
Well, I'll run DNA
on all the hair samples

602
00:31:01,615 --> 00:31:03,016
and match it to the victims.

603
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,284
The guy that did this...

604
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:06,119
Died exactly
where you're standing.

605
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:08,254
Hey.

606
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:11,791
In here.

607
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:18,765
The same exact barrel
the girls were in.

608
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,402
Jesus.
What'd he do with these?

609
00:31:22,436 --> 00:31:23,970
The preliminary
medical examiner's report

610
00:31:24,004 --> 00:31:25,505
said all the girls
were electrocuted.

611
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:27,674
We're gonna need forensics
in the attic.

612
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,176
I think he kept
the girls up there.

613
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:33,813
It looks like Boyd Fowler
has become our primary focus.

614
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:41,321
Do you know this man?

615
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:43,623
No.

616
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:46,259
Well, he knows you.

617
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:48,294
He has all your books
and CDs in his house.

618
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:50,797
[Stammers]

619
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:53,666
I've sold over a million
copies of my book.

620
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:54,968
Almost as many CDs.

621
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:57,036
I'm just trying to figure out

622
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,838
how he came to be driving
your truck.

623
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:01,040
[Sighs]

624
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:02,876
Well, I'm sorry, but...

625
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,678
I know him.
Boyd Fowler.

626
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:09,415
He was one of your stalkers.

627
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,418
And how come I'm
just now hearing this?

628
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,854
No reason to tell you about
every nut that passes through.

629
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:17,690
He never seemed
like a serious threat.

630
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:19,292
He took a few seminars
a while back

631
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,227
and then started showing up
at our office

632
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:23,029
asking for Mr. Chase.

633
00:32:23,063 --> 00:32:25,164
I had to escort him off
the premises a few times.

634
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:26,232
He was clearly a bit off,

635
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:28,201
but he never struck
me as dangerous.

636
00:32:28,235 --> 00:32:31,938
He's dangerous.

637
00:32:31,972 --> 00:32:36,843
He'd been in and out
of our offices enough times.

638
00:32:36,877 --> 00:32:38,945
Probably saw where
I put the keys.

639
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:41,180
When's the last time you
had contact with him?

640
00:32:41,215 --> 00:32:44,751
Haven't seen him for a while.

641
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:46,185
Couple of months maybe.

642
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,054
Any idea where he might be?

643
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:51,524
No.

644
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,194
We have a warrant
for his arrest.

645
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:58,698
I suggest that you be especially
cautious, Mr. Chase,

646
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:00,366
because if he has
a thing for you,

647
00:33:00,401 --> 00:33:01,834
you could be in danger.

648
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:03,970
Noted.

649
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:05,471
Now, if you have
any contact with him,

650
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,707
please get in touch
with us immediately.

651
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:10,376
This guy is very bad news.

652
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:12,712
I will.

653
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:13,947
Thank you for coming in.

654
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:16,983
I appreciate it.

655
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:42,208
You finally
did something right.

656
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,077
Steering the cops toward Boyd.

657
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:46,813
Very smart.

658
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,781
It wasn't me.

659
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:59,726
Daddy's going
to Boca Raton tonight.

660
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,429
'Cause that's
where Cole Harmon lives.

661
00:34:03,464 --> 00:34:07,233
He's a bad man.

662
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:09,435
And I'm gonna try to find out

663
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,305
who the rest of his bad man
friends are.

664
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:14,107
You want that?
[Knock on door]

665
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:15,875
[Door opens]

666
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,410
Hi.

667
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:20,279
There's my angel.

668
00:34:20,314 --> 00:34:25,084
Let me just set my things down.

669
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,919
Wonder how much longer
I'm gonna be able

670
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:28,221
to talk to you like this.

671
00:34:28,255 --> 00:34:32,325
Soon you're gonna start
to understand me.

672
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:35,094
Harrison clearly loves
his Saint Brigid.

673
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:37,030
He put it with his
favorite toys.

674
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:39,032
I put that in the toy box.

675
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:40,500
Sorry?

676
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:41,834
It's just a statue of a lady

677
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:43,036
who died a long time ago.

678
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,937
She doesn't protect anybody
or anything.

679
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:47,106
I should get to work.

680
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,641
Here.
Go to Sonya.

681
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:53,379
Oh.

682
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:57,050
It's just this can be
a very dark world at times,

683
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:58,918
and since dear Brigid has always
been a comfort to me,

684
00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:00,653
I thought Harrison might
feel the same.

685
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:03,456
I hope for his sake,
you'd reconsider.

686
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,160
Sure.

687
00:35:07,194 --> 00:35:09,262
Bye, buddy.

688
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:10,963
[Door opens]

689
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:14,767
So, uh...
What are you wearing tonight?

690
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:16,369
To the big stakeout?

691
00:35:16,403 --> 00:35:19,272
Um, a diaper probably.

692
00:35:19,306 --> 00:35:20,840
[Laughs]

693
00:35:20,874 --> 00:35:22,108
I'll have to sit in that van

694
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:24,310
with Batista for hours.

695
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:26,946
Will you please not wear
that awful shirt

696
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,514
with the patterns all over it?

697
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:30,249
It really makes me dizzy.

698
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:33,319
No, I, uh, only wore
that as a joke.

699
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:34,754
[Knock on door]
Oh.

700
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:36,923
Hey, I got to go.
I'll see you later tonight.

701
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:39,959
Okay.
[Keypad tone]

702
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:47,667
Hey.

703
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:49,435
[Chuckles] Well, look at you.

704
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,703
Pretty as a picture.

705
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:52,171
[Chuckles]

706
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:53,372
I only got a few minutes,
so, uh,

707
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:54,607
what do you got for me?

708
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:55,808
I don't work for free, Quinn.

709
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:58,644
All right, well,
I just gave you 500 bucks.

710
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,813
And I told you about the girl.

711
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:02,648
But if you want
to find out who she is,

712
00:36:02,683 --> 00:36:05,218
where she's from, and what she's
doing in that damn house,

713
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:07,453
I might have to employ
some methods

714
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:11,157
just a little bit unorthodox.

715
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:13,493
And for that,
you're gonna have to pay.

716
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:15,394
I don't know.

717
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:17,563
I know you got the cash.

718
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:19,499
Yeah, it's not that.

719
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:21,834
