1
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,800
- Cheerio, lads!
- Quiet, Croker! You're not out yet.

2
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,600
- Sorry, sir.
- Good luck, Charles.

3
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,400
Remember me to the old woman!

4
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,900
- I will, Harry, I will.
- Say hello to the big world.

5
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,500
Bye-bye.

6
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,600
Goodbye, Mr Bridger.

7
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,100
- He said, "Goodbye, Mr Bridger."
- Well, he's going.

8
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,200
As long as he doesn't come back.
That's all I care.

9
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,900
They say
he's going to do a job in ltaly.

10
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,500
I hope he likes spaghetti.

11
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,500
They serve it four times a day
in ltalian prisons.

12
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,600
Well, you're the last person
I expected to see, Lorna.

13
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,100
Oh, Charlie,
I've been counting the days.

14
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah? Well, why didn't you come
and see me when I was inside?

15
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,800
Charlie, you know
that's not my scene.

16
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Sitting holding your hands
across the table,

17
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,100
with those weeping wives around
with their howling kids,

18
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,100
the guards looking at me as if
something's hidden up my dress.

19
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,600
- I did miss you, Charlie.
- Yeah?

20
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,000
Erm... I, erm... made an appointment
for you to go to the tailor first.

21
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,100
Then on to the shirtmaker...

22
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,900
This car belongs
to the Pakistani ambassador.

23
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,100
- It does?
- Typical, isn't it?

24
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,800
Out of jail five minutes
and already I'm in a hot car.

25
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,300
I just wanted you
to come out in style, baby!

26
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,700
Take me to my tailor.

27
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,200
Very elegant, sir,
though you've put on a little weight.

28
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,300
Well, er... I've been in America.

29
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,100
- It's the bread in the hamburgers.
- Is that so?

30
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,700
Well, I'm glad you're out.
I mean, back.

31
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,600
I don't want to be rude, Charles,
but times have changed.

32
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,500
Adrian, when I went in
that was all the go.

33
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,100
What did you do? Life?

34
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,200
You know, you could put all these
in a museum.

35
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,400
I'll tell you what I'll do with you,
Adrian.

36
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,700
- I'll take this lot now.
- Revolting.

37
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,100
Eh? I'll take this lot now.
You wrap 'em up.

38
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,600
And will you shorten the sleeves,
love? I'm not a gorilla.

39
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,700
Yes! Well, there we are,
Captain Croker.

40
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,100
I think you'll find
we've kept it in perfect tone.

41
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,700
I'll run the engine for you,
shall I?

42
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,700
You'll be able to hear
what it sounds like.

43
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,500
- There, how's that?

44
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
- I say.
- Yes?

45
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
- I say.
- Hello?

46
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,400
There you are.
I thought I'd lost you!

47
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,500
No, I came round here.
Erm... I was just thinking,

48
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,400
maybe it needs a little more air
through the second carburettor.

49
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,800
- Oh, do you think so?
- Listen.

50
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,400
- Yes, maybe you're right. I'll...
- I'll do it. Just stay there.

51
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,300
Would you open the bonnet for me,
please? Thank you.

52
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,600
- I wonder if you'd hold this for me?
- The, er...?

53
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,500
- The bonnet.
- Of course.

54
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,400
Thank you.

55
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,800
- I didn't quite...
- Yes. There we are.

56
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,300
- You want me to...
- Hold. Thank you.

57
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,600
There we are.

58
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,900
- Now... Yes. I can, er...
- How are you doing?

59
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,500
I can see what's wrong.
It's very small.

60
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,200
No, I don't know. It's alright.
Leave it, leave it.

61
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,300
- Shall I...?
- Yes, you shut it and I'll lock it.

62
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,900
- Thank you.
- How are you doing?

63
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,500
- Long time since I was in here.
- I dare say! There we are.

64
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,300
I haven't been in this car
for so long.

65
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,300
Yes, I gather you've been in India
for two years, sir.

66
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,500
- Yes, shooting tigers.
- Really? Splendid.

67
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The garage bill, sir.

68
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,400
- Yes?
- I'm afraid it's £200.

69
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,000
If you insist, we can charge it.

70
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,000
No. Please! There's a bounty
for shooting tigers.

71
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
- Well...
- Yes, it's £50 a head.

72
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,800
- Really? There's no need to pay...
- These are bundles of 200.

73
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,500
- There's no need to pay now.
- It's alright.

74
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,500
Yes, you must have
shot an awful lot of tigers, sir.

75
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Yes, I used a machine gun.

76
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,000
<i>Calling Mr R J Williams.
Mr Williams to Reception, please...</i>

77
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,800
- Lord Croker. I am expected.
- Yes, Your Lordship. Suite 602.

78
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,000
And there's a message.

79
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,600
Thank you.

80
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
Hello, Charlie!

81
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,800
Shut the door, Charlie.
You'll cause a terrible draught.

82
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,900
Ladies?

83
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
- Charlie!
- Hello, Charlie!

84
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,400
- Love you, Charlie.
- Ciao!

85
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,300
- Nice Charlie.
- Good to see you, Charlie.

86
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,900
Well, I thought,
a coming-out present!

87
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,200
- Very nice.
- Now, what would you like?

88
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,600
Everything.

89
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,300
- Where's your old man?
- Dead.

90
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,300
In the Alps, in a car crash.
It wasn't an accident.

91
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,800
Oh. Well, there goes the job, then.

92
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,700
- Wait, Mr Croker.
- Yes, Mrs Beckerman?

93
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
This is for you.

94
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,300
What's this?
Some sort of a consolation prize?

95
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,600
Plans that my husband
didn't have time to complete.

96
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,400
- He wants you to finish them.
- Oh, he does, does he?

97
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Tell me, erm... where do you figure

98
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,400
in the plans your husband
didn't have time to complete?

99
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,900
I don't. I am going to New York
tomorrow at 6:00am.

100
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
Ah. Pity.

101
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,700
But... that still gives us
four hours to kill.

102
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,200
And you
still in your widow's weeds...

103
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,700
<i>Charlie Croker, I am dead.</i>

104
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,700
<i>- Hello, Roger.
- I have arranged for my widow</i>

105
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,800
<i>- to get material to you in England.
- Yes, I got it.</i>

106
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,300
<i>There you must find the backing
to do the job.</i>

107
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,200
<i>You must, Charlie.
Because it is a work of genius.</i>

108
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,800
<i>Just think of it. A city in chaos,</i>

109
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,500
<i>a smash-and-grab raid</i>

110
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,600
<i>and four million dollars
through a traffic jam.</i>

111
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,600
- Four million dollars?

112
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:50,000
<i>This is the city of Turin,
the industrial capital of Italy.</i>

113
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,900
<i>The most modern in Europe, famed for
its architecture, and soon, I trust,</i>

114
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,100
<i>for the greatest robbery
of the 20th century.</i>

115
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:08,400
<i>This is the FIAT armoured convoy.
It leaves Turin airport every week.</i>

116
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,600
<i>It never carries
less than four million dollars.</i>

117
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
I think we could take that over.

118
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,500
<i>To reach its destination
the convoy has to travel</i>

119
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,000
<i>through one of the busiest
traffic systems in Europe,</i>

120
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,800
<i>a system
controlled by television cameras</i>

121
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,300
<i>and by the computer in this building,
the Turin Traffic Control Centre.</i>

122
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,200
<i>If you can get into this room,
Charlie,</i>

123
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,500
<i>you will cause the biggest traffic
jam in the history of the world.</i>

124
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,000
<i>Every street will be paralysed.</i>

125
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,100
<i>And then you will have a chance
to ambush that convoy.</i>

126
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Very nice.

127
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,700
<i>Now, Charlie,
first you neutralise the TV cameras</i>

128
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,200
<i>which overlook the convoy's route.</i>

129
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,200
<i>You do this
with these little gadgets here. Look.</i>

130
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
<i>- Yeah.
- Second,</i>

131
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:11,300
<i>you break into the computer building
and substitute this new program.</i>

132
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,500
<i>- Got it.
- This causes the jam.</i>

133
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
Right.

134
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:24,200
<i>Third, you attack the convoy in your
own inimitable way, Charlie.</i>

135
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,300
<i>And fourth, you escape,</i>

136
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,200
<i>on the only route out of the city
which is not blocked up with traffic.</i>

137
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,200
<i>You'll find details of the route
in this portfolio.</i>

138
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,500
<i>Within just two hours, you will be
over the Alps and into Switzerland.</i>

139
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,700
<i>And within three you'll have
the money safe in a Geneva bank.</i>

140
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,000
<i>- Make it work, Charlie!
- I will, Roger.</i>

141
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,900
Four million dollars,
through a traffic jam.

142
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Money received from Brighton
is £15,000.

143
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,300
<i>- Hello. Camp Freddie?
- Croker! Aren't you in Italy?</i>

144
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,000
- I want to see Bridger.
- Mr Bridger to you.

145
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
I've got a job.

146
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,100
<i>If it's the GPO, City Road,
it's being done next week.</i>

147
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,100
This job is bigger than anything
Bridger's done up until now.

148
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,400
If it's the Bank of England,
it's out.

149
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,200
Mr Bridger's very worried
about the economy.

150
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,000
Exactly, Freddie!
Tell Bridger this is a foreign job

151
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,300
to help with this country's
balance of payments.

152
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,300
Charlie, I don't think
you have the kind of scheme

153
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,800
that yields the size of profit
Mr Bridger is accustomed to.

154
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,600
But, Freddie, this job is big.

155
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,800
Charlie, you wouldn't even know
how to spell big.

156
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
B-I-G. Big.

157
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,600
Now, Butch Harry,
tell us about Fulham.

158
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,700
Well, now... Fulham.
A bit dodgy at the moment.

159
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,200
How are you? How do you feel
about a little outing?

160
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,300
Hello, Hazel.
Hazel, my lovely, out you come.

161
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,000
Come on, then. There you are.

162
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,900
It's a long time since
you've seen the nightlife, innit?

163
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,000
Where's my torch?
Where's my bloody torch?

164
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,800
- Good evening, Mr Bridger.
- Croker!

165
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Mr Bridger, I've got a job lined up.

166
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,000
Get out of here.

167
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,800
It's all here. Maps, drawings,
plans, everything.

168
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,600
You've been put up to this,

169
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,400
bribed to upset my natural rhythm
and ruin my health.

170
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,900
No, Mr Bridger. This is important.
Four million dollars. Europe.

171
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,500
The Common Market.
Italy, the FIAT car factory.

172
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,800
- Croker, this is my toilet.
- Please. Just read it.

173
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,900
Get out.

174
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,100
Are you alright, Mr Bridger?

175
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,200
Are you alright?

176
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,600
He's alright!

177
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,700
I can always take it
to the Americans.

178
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,900
They're people who recognise young
talent, give it a chance, they are.

179
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,500
Last night, Mr Governor,
my toilet was broken into.

180
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,900
- Toilet?
- Toilet.

181
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,800
- Broken into?
- Broken into.

182
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,800
Well, I'm... terribly sorry.

183
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,900
There are some places
which, to an Englishman, are sacred.

184
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,100
- Well, I've apologised, Bridger.
- And so you should have.

185
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,100
You are not doing your job properly.
Her Majesty's prison is there

186
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,200
not only to keep people getting out,
but to prevent people getting in.

187
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,000
You are symptomatic
of the lazy, unimaginative management

188
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,700
which is driving this country
on the rocks!

189
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,600
- Well... is there anything else?
- No, thank you, Governor.

190
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,800
By the way, Mr Bridger, did you
happen to recognise the man

191
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,000
who so rudely interrupted you?

192
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,700
I've never seen him before
in my life.

193
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,200
I want Charlie Croker
given a good going-over.

194
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,700
- Yes, Mr Bridger.
- Tell Camp Freddie.

195
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,900
- Yes, Mr Bridger.
- I don't want him killed.

196
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,200
Just given a good going-over.

197
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,700
I understand exactly what you mean.

198
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,900
Do you, Keats?
That's very imaginative of you.

199
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,500
<i>Sir, two volumes
of the Anglo-American Trade.</i>

200
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,900
<i>And UK Balance of Payments,
1966 and '67.</i>

201
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,300
<i>And... I've also brought
you The Illustrated London News, sir.</i>

202
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,200
For why, Keats, for why?

203
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,500
- The Queen's in it, sir.
- Hmm. That's good of you.

204
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,600
Er... sir, I often wonder whether
you're going to top your career

205
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,700
by doing a job on their house.

206
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,200
Keats, there are more things to life
than breaking and entering.

207
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,500
- Yes, Mr Bridger.
- While we're on the subject,

208
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,900
I notice that some of that young mob
in E Block

209
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,800
don't stand for the National Anthem,
at the end of the nightly TV.

210
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,200
Tell them to do so,
or they will incur my displeasure.

211
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,300
- Yes, Mr Bridger.
- Alright, be off with you.

212
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,300
Get the word to Camp Freddie.

213
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,600
Sir.

214
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,000
- Right then, Fred, come on.
- Wait a minute.

215
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,200
Take your filthy clothes, too!
This is my man, my territory,

216
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,100
and don't come back!

217
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,600
Charlie's been caught on the job.

218
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,400
OK, Charlie. Alright, where are you?

219
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,300
I know you're in here.
There's no use hiding.

220
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,000
- You had three birds in here.
- You didn't mind at the hotel.

221
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,100
That was a coming-out present.

222
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
I didn't get a chance to enjoy it.

223
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,800
I didn't enjoy it today, neither.
Coming in causing a fracas.

224
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,500
- Ask me where I've been.
- You've been with the law.

225
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,800
Yes, for taking the ambassador's car

226
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,900
and for not paying the hotel bill.
You deserted me!

227
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,600
Don't come the moody.
You know how the game is.

228
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,400
No, you left me to my fate.

229
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,000
- Usual one, was it?
- 24 hours in prison.

230
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,100
- It was humiliating.
- How did you get out?

231
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,700
The ambassador for Pakistan
was very sweet.

232
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,500
- Very sweet, was he?
- And so was the hotel manager.

233
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,600
Lorna, I knew you'd be alright.

234
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,600
No thanks to you, Charlie Croker,
I can tell you.

235
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,000
- Lorna, I was busy, wasn't I?!
- Oh! So I see!

236
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,100
So I came in here and saw!
I want you out.

237
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,700
If you don't think I mean it,
then you're wrong!

238
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,100
- Charlie! It's the law, Charlie!
- What did you tell them?

239
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,700
- Would I tell them anything?
- Of course you would.

240
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,400
Morning.

241
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,300
Hello, Croker. We've come
with Mr Bridger's compliments.

242
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,500
Sorry it's like this, Charlie.

243
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,700
Listen, lads, er... you wouldn't hit
a fella... with no trousers on.

244
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,900
- Would you?
- OK, then, put 'em on.

245
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,300
Get away from me!

246
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,600
- Have you seen Croker?
- Yes, Mr Bridger.

247
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:26,200
- Well, I want you to see him again.
- He won't take kindly to that.

248
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,600
- I'm interested in his scheme.
- But, Mr Bridger...

249
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,600
What you fail to realise
is that we have a new objective.

250
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,300
The Chinese are giving FIAT
four million dollars in gold,

251
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,500
as a down payment on a car plant
they're constructing near Peking.

252
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,900
But Croker...

253
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Croker can handle it.
He's got everything going for him.

254
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,100
There's even a football match in
Turin the day before the delivery.

255
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,700
England versus ltaly. The English
supporters can cover his movements,

256
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,500
even help him, if required.

257
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,600
There's only one snag.
We need an expert in computers

258
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,800
to look after the technical end.

259
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,800
The top man is Professor Peach.
I've seen him on television.

260
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,000
- Tell Croker to get him.
- But how?

261
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,000
- Maybe the Professor's not bent.
- Camp Freddie,

262
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,800
everybody in the world is bent.

263
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,700
Well, my brother's no longer with us,
I'm afraid.

264
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,900
- No.
- You mean, he's...

265
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,900
Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

266
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,700
Well, actually, he's in a home.

267
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,300
Yes. We thought it best.
For his own good.

268
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,500
Er... was it, er... serious,
Miss Peach?

269
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,700
- Pam.
- Serious, was it?

270
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,400
- What?
- Your brother. In the home.

271
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,400
Oh, yes, I'm afraid
it was quite serious, dear.

272
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,800
- Isn't this greenfly awful?
- Yes.

273
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,600
Yes, well, not to put
a too fine point to it,

274
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,000
he was discovered... in the lounge.

275
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
- Er... doing what, Miss Peach?
- Where?

276
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,400
- In the, er... lounge.
- Oh, yes, he was doing it. Yes.

277
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,000
What?

278
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Oh. Well, something quite obscene.
With Annette.

279
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,500
- A net?
- Annette.

280
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,600
She was terrified, of course.

281
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,100
- Naturally.
- Yes, well, would you like some tea?

282
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
- Eh?
- Tea. Would you like some?

283
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,100
- You're very kind. Yes, please.
- Good.

284
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,200
Excuse me a minute.

285
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,300
Annette? Annette, would you serve tea
in the lounge, dear?

286
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,100
I shouldn't let her do that, dear.
That gives them ideas.

287
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,200
This is Annette.

288
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,200
Professor Peach,
do you see what I'm getting at?

289
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,300
Mmm. Your brawn, my brain.
I'm not stupid, you know.

290
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,200
Cooperation, isn't it?
Like that flagpole out there.

291
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,900
- Flagpole?
- The flagpole in the yard.

292
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,500
I know if there was a convex mirror
up there,

293
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:39,800
27° vertical, 42° horizontal, I could
see straight into Matron's bedroom!

294
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,800
But somebody else
would have to be up the pole.

295
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,600
Couldn't do it myself. Cooperation,
you see? She's a big woman.

296
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,100
Here... Wait till you see
them Italian birds.

297
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,200
- Are they big? I like them big.
- They're enormous.

298
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,100
- Really?
- Very, very, very big.

299
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Would we, er... wear stockings
over our heads?

300
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,900
- No need for you to.
- Oh. I'd like that.

301
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,900
I could steal one of Matron's,
couldn't I?

302
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,300
We'll have you out of here
in no time.

303
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,200
I wouldn't want to get Matron
into trouble. Not that way, anyway!

304
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,400
- She's big. Big!
- Look out the window, Professor.

305
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,600
- What?
- Look out at my car.

306
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,000
- Car? Wh-Wh-What car?
- Down there.

307
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,600
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Please, gentlemen. Please.

308
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,300
We are about to do a job in Italy

309
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,200
and I would like to introduce you all
to each other.

310
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,600
First, Bill Bailey.
He'll be my number two.

311
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,700
You all know Bill. He's just done
three years in Parkhurst.

312
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,800
As honest as the day is long.
You can trust him.

313
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,200
Second, the getaway. This will
be done in three Mini Coopers.

314
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,300
And they will be driven
by Chris, Tony and Dominic.

315
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,800
Hello, chaps.

316
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,900
Alright! These chinless wonders
will get you out of Turin

317
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,600
faster than anyone else
on four wheels. Remember that.

318
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,100
When we get to the Alps,
we will transfer to a coach.

319
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,100
The coach will be driven
by William here,

320
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,100
better known as Big William,
for very obvious reasons.

321
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,200
Now, we come to the Professor here,

322
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,300
who is in charge of all matters
relating to the Turin computer.

323
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,600
I don't want anyone putting him
down because he's a man of reading.

324
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,700
I know he's got some...
very funny habits,

325
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,300
but make him feel at home.
He's very important to the operation.

326
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,300
Finally, and very quickly,
I would like to introduce

327
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,700
all the lads
who are going to do the job with me.

328
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,700
Arthur, Frank, Rozzer, Coco,

329
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yellow, Camp Freddie you all know.

330
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,500
Roger, Dave and Lorna will be
in reserve with three fast cars

331
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,400
in case anything goes wrong.

332
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,800
Right? Now, it's a very difficult job

333
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,200
and the only way to get through it
is, we all work together as a team.

334
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,700
And that means
you do everything I say.

335
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,700
Here's Charlie.

336
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,200
Putting the jib on.

337
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,100
Don't just stand there.
Get on with something.

338
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,700
- I'm seeing he does it right.
- Get on with it.

339
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,000
- Rozzer?
Trouble with his differential.

340
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,500
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Hurry up.

341
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,500
Dippers for the Continent.

342
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,200
Other way round.
Are they quartz-iodide?

343
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,500
- That's right, guvnor.
- Alright.

344
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,600
We couldn't afford gold,
so we're using lead.

345
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,900
- Will it take the weight?
- Eh?

346
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,700
Take the weight.
Will it take the weight?

347
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,500
Mind your face, Charles.

348
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,000
- Alright?
- OK, but I don't like the colour.

349
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,600
It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
Carry on.

350
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,900
- He really needs all this equipment?
- He says he does.

351
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,700
No. You're meant to use your brakes,
Chris.

352
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,300
Terribly sorry, Charles.

353
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,500
- How many cars have we got left?
- A couple.

354
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,500
OK, next one.
Let's hope he gets it right.

355
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,000
What do you mean they're written off?

356
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,400
A series of accidents, Mr Bridger.
I promise there'll be no more.

357
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Five, four, three,

358
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,100
two, one.

359
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,800
Go.

360
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You're only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off!

361
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,100
How's your new house, Fred?

362
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,300
Very nice, Mr Bridger, thank you.
Very nice.

363
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,100
My pleasure.

364
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,300
<i>Beckerman's done his homework
very well.</i>

365
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,800
<i>The getaway is possible,
but not easy.</i>

366
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,700
<i>For a start, the attack
has to be made in this square.</i>

367
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,500
<i>And it must be completed
inside of three minutes.</i>

368
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,600
<i>Apart from knocking over
a few old dears, we'll manage it.</i>

369
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,000
You all understand
what you've got to do?

370
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
OK? Now, Bill.

371
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,700
Er... Oh, yeah. The transporters
will move in here and here.

372
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,100
- They'll block off the main drag.
- Right. Roger.

373
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,700
Erm... Arthur and Lorna
park the three fast cars here

374
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,400
in case we have
to make a quick getaway.

375
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,500
Correct. It's 12:10. The bullion van
will be entering the piazza

376
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
and will be forced slowly
towards the centre.

377
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,500
<i>It's the old over-and-under routine.</i>

378
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,200
<i>First we go over the traffic,
through the museums.</i>

379
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,600
<i>And then under again.
And up into this church.</i>

380
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,600
<i>The difficulty is here.</i>

381
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,200
<i>If the police can get a car
onto that bridge</i>

382
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,900
<i>before we've got across it,
we're done for.</i>

383
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,900
<i>But it's a gamble we've got to take.</i>

384
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,800
Now, the bullion wagon is here.
Right? Dominic.

385
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,700
We get into the Minis
behind the piazza.

386
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,100
Right. Arthur.

387
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,800
We drive the Land Rover
into the square.

388
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,800
Piazza, Arthur, piazza.

389
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,600
- Sorry, Charlie. Piazza.
- The Land Rover is in the piazza.

390
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,100
And we come in right behind target.

391
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,800
That's it. Wallop.

392
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,100
<i>But since the bridge
will be blocked by traffic</i>

393
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,100
<i>the only possible way out
is across the weir,</i>

394
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,700
<i>which runs along
by the side of the bridge.</i>

395
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,400
<i>I've only one comment about that,
Mr Bridger.</i>

396
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,000
<i>Good luck.</i>

397
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,000
Keats, I think we'd better arrange...
a funeral.

398
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,100
- All ready to go, Croker?
- Yes, Mr Bridger.

399
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,100
The plans have been worked out
to the last detail?

400
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,600
- Yes, Mr Bridger.
- Everything taken care of?

401
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,000
- Yes, Mr Bridger.
- You've overlooked one thing.

402
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,900
The Mafia.
They'll be waiting for you.

403
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,600
In every shot of Camp Freddie's film
there's a Mafia man.

404
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,600
If they were on to Beckerman
they're on to us.

405
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,900
You're not thinking
of calling it off?

406
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,700
As long as you know
what you're taking on.

407
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,800
- Yes. The Mafia.
- Yes. The Mafia.

408
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,100
You are about to take a half a ton
of gold, in broad daylight,

409
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,200
from under their noses.
They won't like that.

410
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,200
- That's why they killed Beckerman.
- A question of prestige, is it?

411
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,100
Yes, it's a question of prestige.

412
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,000
If you go through with this,
you've got to win.

413
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,200
If you muck it up,
don't ever think of coming back,

414
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,000
except in your coffin.

415
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,900
Who's that lot?

416
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,800
- The drivers.
- That lot smashed up my cars.

417
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,000
Practice makes perfect, Mr Bridger.

418
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,900
You pick 'em, don't you?

419
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,100
Mr Bridger will now say a few words.

420
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,300
- What?
- Your speech, sir.

421
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,500
We have come here to pay our respects
to Great Aunt Nellie.

422
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,900
She brought us up properly
and taught us loyalty.

423
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,100
I want you to remember that
during these next few days.

424
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,700
I also want you to remember that if
you don't come back with the goods,

425
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,600
Nellie here will turn in her grave.

426
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,700
And, likely as not, jump right
out of it and kick your teeth in.

427
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:15,000
Dave, take the valley road to Turin,
OK? Go.

428
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,200
You three take the Minis along
the B road and keep the speed down.

429
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,400
Right, go on, away you go.
Freddie, stay with the bus.

430
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,600
Big William, take the bus
along the main road. Go! Go!

431
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,600
You lot, stay with me.
We'll go round the mountain route.

432
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,700
Where's Peach?

433
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,400
Hey! What do you think this is?
A Sunday school outing?

434
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,100
Pity people aren't as lovely
as flowers.

435
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,200
Take your flowers and get in the car.

436
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,000
Hurry up.

437
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,700
Mr Croker?

438
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,700
That's right.

439
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Six weeks ago, a friend of yours met
with an accident on this very road.

440
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,300
- So?
- Do you mind if I show you how?

441
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,000
No.

442
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,600
You just lost him
his insurance bonus.

443
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:47,000
It cost Beckerman his life.
Listen, the gold arrives tomorrow.

444
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,100
And you think you can pick it up

445
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,400
like a bunch of groceries
in the supermarket, hmm?

446
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,100
Just how are you going to do it?

447
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,400
Oh, excuse me.

448
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:16,800
Does Mr Bridger think he can
take over Europe from a prison cell?

449
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,400
Your car?

450
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,300
Yeah.

451
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,700
Pretty car.

452
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,200
Paid for?

453
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,200
Very funny.

454
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,200
You'll be making a grave error
if you kill us.

455
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,200
There are a quarter of a million
Italians in Britain.

456
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,800
And they'll be made to suffer.

457
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,100
Every restaurant, cafe, ice-cream
parlour, gambling den and nightclub

458
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,200
in London, Liverpool and Glasgow,
will be smashed.

459
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,700
Mr Bridger will drive them
into the sea.

460
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,800
Well, gentlemen,
it's a long walk back to England.

461
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,700
And it's that way. Good morning.

462
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,700
May I salute our American cousin
Signor Francesco Cosca

463
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,500
and his lovely wife?

464
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:22,000
And may I raise my glass to Signor
Altabani and his most beautiful wife,

465
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,400
to thank him for his hospitality?

466
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:31,000
And to congratulate him on the way he
handled the English mob this morning.

467
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,000
I would not be too sure
about the English, cousin.

468
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,400
They wouldn't dare!

469
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,200
They are not so stupid as they look.

470
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,900
Candles! Quickly!

471
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,000
Gentlemen, we must assume
they are here.

472
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,400
- Got your passport?
- I think so.

473
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,600
You need your passport
directly after the tickets.

474
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,100
As you walk to the plane
look neither right nor left.

475
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,800
Just look straight ahead. OK?
Keep going straight ahead.

476
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,500
Geneva, please. Got it?
Neither to the right.

477
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,100
- Nor to the left. Straight ahead.
- Left. Straight ahead.

478
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,300
And keep going.

479
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,100
Charlie, listen!
The plan was that we stay here.

480
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,600
The plan's changed.

481
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,700
- But why, Charlie? Why?
- Because you're a liability.

482
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,000
Lorna, you see that lot out there?

483
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,800
If we slip up, they'll tear us apart.

484
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,400
And... I don't want you involved
any more.

485
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,600
- Charlie?
- What?

486
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,800
You care?

487
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,300
Get on the, er... plane.
I'll see you... in Geneva.

488
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,900
Have a cup of tea ready.

489
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,300
Bye-bye, Charlie!

490
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,400
Get on the plane. Get on the plane.

491
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,700
I love you, Charlie!

492
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,500
- Hello, Charlie!
- Hello, lads.

493
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,300
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Chris.

494
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,900
- Before we leave... Bill?
- Yes, Charlie?

495
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,500
I want every tin burned.

496
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,200
No fingerprints
on anything in the house.

497
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,300
- We're wearing gloves.
- You can't be too careful.

498
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,300
- Is there a toilet here?
- Of sorts. Out the back.

499
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,300
Wash the handle and the seat.
No prints on that, either.

500
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,900
Right, here is the crunch.

501
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,000
- Do you all know how to get there?
- Actually, we can all read maps.

502
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,500
The map will be in your head.
I'm burning this one. Any questions?

503
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,500
Without the two Jags and the Aston,
what if anything does go wrong?

504
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,700
Put your gloves on. Anything else?

505
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,300
- Shall we synchronise our watches?
- Nuts to your watches.

506
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,900
You just be there by quarter to and
don't get stuck in the traffic jam.

507
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,900
Anything else?

508
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,200
Right. Away you go.

509
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,100
Oh! One more thing.

510
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:02,700
Just remember, in this country they
drive on the wrong side of the road.

511
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,200
- Bill?
- Yes, Charlie?

512
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,800
- Bill!
- Yes, Charlie?

513
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Burn this for me, will you?

514
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,100
Yes, Charlie.

515
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,300
- Oh, Bill?
- Yes, Charlie?

516
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,600
- Get rid of this lot.
- Yes, Charlie.

517
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,500
- They're in a trattoria in the city.
- They know where to put these?

518
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,700
Yes, you can see the cameras
on the rooftops.

519
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,600
- I can't argue.
- Me in the front, you in the back.

520
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,300
He wants to sit up front
with the driver.

521
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,700
- I get sick in the back.
- I'll get my migraine.

522
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,400
- I'll be out like a light.
- You are not going to be sick.

523
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,800
You're not going to have migraine.

524
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,600
Everybody is sitting
in the back of the motor.

525
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,400
Me in the back of the motor,
with my asthma?

526
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,800
One more word out of you, Arthur...
Alright?

527
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:57,800
Alright. Now, everybody,
all your gear in here.

528
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,000
Get your gear out.
Pens, wallets, passports,

529
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,200
photos of your girlfriend.
And those cards. Put 'em in 'ere.

530
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,200
- I'm going to need these cards.
- What? Put them in here!

531
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,100
I want mascots, money,
bottle openers.

532
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,400
...in London I was up drainpipes
and the game was up.

533
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,600
All I had to do, all the time. What?

534
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,800
- I'm getting a contact!
- Let's hear it. Turn it up.

535
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,600
I'll turn it up.

536
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,600
How about that?!

537
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,600
How about what?
They've finished loading the gold.

538
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,100
Right, get dressed.

539
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,000
Right, away you go.

540
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,900
Away you go.

541
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,000
<i>- Grazie.
- Molto bene, Dad.</i>

542
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,600
OK, let's go.

543
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,700
Can you direct me
to Corso Garibaldi Street?

544
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,400
- Bloody foreigners.

545
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:53,900
- Excuse me.

546
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,500
Blimey!

547
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,400
Bloody Grand Prix!

548
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,000
- What the devil is happening?
- A traffic jam.

549
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,800
- It gets worse every time.
- We've lost the convoy. Indietro!

550
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,900
Any minute now.

551
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,900
It's like the Black Hole
of Calcutta in here.

552
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:52,100
Shut it, Arthur.
What are they gabbling about, Franco?

553
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,700
- Complaining about the jam.
- It won't be the only complaint.

554
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,200
- Keep calm.
- Get off my feet!

555
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:21,100
Alright, alright! Get yourselves
sorted out and shut up!

556
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,500
No one talks now except me.

557
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,400
Now, now, now! Now!
Get in front of it!

558
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,000
Put your helmets on.

559
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,700
Hold tight.

560
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,900
Now! Go round! Get in front of it.

561
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,600
Oi! Put that bloody water cannon out!

562
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,500
OK, Bill.

563
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
In you come! In! In!

564
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,000
Back! Back!

565
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,900
Hey! Unload! Unload!

566
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,400
Where do you think you're going?!
Get on with it!

567
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,700
Get in the car. Get back up there.

568
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,200
If anybody comes through, hit 'em.

569
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,900
OK, Charlie, that's it.

570
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:48,100
Right. You, you and you
in the Dormobile. Get in the car.

571
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,300
Oi! Get in the Dormobile.

572
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,900
Get your finger out.

573
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,300
Get a move on, then!

574
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,500
Well, look happy,
you stupid bastards!

575
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,000
We won, didn't we?

576
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,800
They went thattaway.

577
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,400
I could eat a horse!

578
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,900
Good luck!

579
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,700
Put your foot down, Tony.
They're getting rather close.

580
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,200
Look out, look out, it's Charlie!

581
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:04,000
Look for that bloody exit.
We can't go round here all night.

582
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,000
- Manzo?
- Yes, sir.

583
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,000
Check the station. All trains.

584
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,400
Check all names of passengers who
boarded planes at Linate or Malpensa.

585
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,700
This was a big operation.
Those engaged in the earlier part

586
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,800
will probably have left by air.

587
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,900
- Check the autostradas.
- The police will do this.

588
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:49,000
We know them, the police don't.
Get my plane ready.

589
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,800
They can't get out in this mess.

590
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,900
If they planned this jam,
they planned a way out.

591
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,000
- I think you might try to keep up.
- Alright!

592
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,700
Here, make a wish.

593
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,700
They're behind us. Put
your foot down, we'll lose 'em easy.

594
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:28,400
Hurry up, Dominic.

595
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,900
Have you heard, sir?
They've done it!

596
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,100
All the men are yelling for you.
They've done it.

597
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,800
- Done what, Keats?
- The job, sir!

598
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,300
Bridger! Bridger!

599
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,300
Get the wheels in line with it!

600
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,600
Damn it! Brake,
or we'll be in the cabin.

601
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,900
More speed on the up,
accelerate and...

602
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,700
That's it! Go on!

603
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:42,800
OK, hang on.

604
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,000
Be very careful.

605
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,300
Everybody out.
Start unloading the gold.

606
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:31,900
Charlie-boy?

607
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,600
Now.

608
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,300
Ready, Charlie?

609
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,300
Now!

610
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:31,200
Ready?

611
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:35,700
Now!

612
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:06,500
OK, out you come, out you come.

613
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,800
Leave the beer! Leave the beer!
Get in.

614
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,200
Come on.

615
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:15,300
OK, William, go!

616
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,600
Hold still, hold still.

617
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,200
Nobody move.

618
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:06,800
We're balancing right on the edge.
Very slowly, move this way.

619
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,000
Very slowly.
Don't make a sharp movement.

620
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,000
Come as far up this end
as you can get.

621
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:40,300
Watch it, watch it. Watch it, Bill!

622
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:53,800
The gold is pulling it over the edge.
We'll have to get it back.

623
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,000
Get back! Get back!

624
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,800
Now hold still.
Don't move. Don't move at all.

625
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:37,100
Don't no one get out the door,
neither. Otherwise we'll all go.

626
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:06,600
Edge back as far as you can go, to
cou... to counterbalance me. Now...

627
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:03,800
Hang on a minute, lads.
I've got a great idea.
