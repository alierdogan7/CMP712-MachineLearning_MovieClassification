1
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,011
Larry, give me one of those empty jars.

2
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:52,487
Fill them up, will you?

3
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:12,701
Extra!

4
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,882
Read all about it!

5
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:02,147
Give us a swig.

6
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:11,762
- Hello, Tommy.
- Hello.

7
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,036
Can grease?

8
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,734
Come on, Matt. We got business.

9
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:22,040
Give us a little kiss.

10
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,342
That's what you get
for fooling with women.

11
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:36,154
Hey, little boy, stop.
Stop, I say! Stop that!

12
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,637
Officer, get those boys.

13
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:58,110
You little scamps! If I get ahold of you...

14
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,756
Matt, look.

15
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,795
That ain't fair, Tom.

16
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,993
- What do you care? It's only a girl.
- She's my sister, ain't she?

17
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,400
What difference does that make?

18
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:23,270
Help me up, Matt.

19
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,740
Leave her alone. She's doing fine.
That's the way to learn.

20
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,316
That's just like you, Tom Powers.
You're the meanest boy in town.

21
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,443
He is not.
He give you his skates, didn't he?

22
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,579
I believe he did it
just so he could play that trick on me.

23
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,749
- I'm gonna tell your brother Mike.
- Go ahead and tell him.

24
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:44,486
Here he comes now.

25
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,425
You'll help me, won't you, Mike?

26
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:49,056
- Where'd you get the skates, Molly?
- Tom gave them to me.

27
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:51,600
Tom did? Where'd you get them, Tom?

28
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:54,602
He got them from a kid
who owed him some money.

29
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:59,271
I'll bet you stole them, Tom.
Give them back, Molly.

30
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,674
Why don't you mind your own business?

31
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:04,178
Nobody asked you
to put your two cents in.

32
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,613
Here, Tom.
I don't want them if you stole them.

33
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:09,583
- So you're getting like sissy Mike, too.
- Take them, Tom.

34
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:12,621
You ain't so darn good.
Your old man swipes pigeons.

35
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:16,215
Tom Powers, he does not!
You're a big liar.

36
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,022
He's in jail.
They don't put people there for nothing.

37
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,120
Everybody who belongs there, ain't there.

38
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:23,791
That's where you'll be someday,
Tom Powers.

39
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:27,563
I ain't there yet.
If I do go, it won't be for swiping pigeons.

40
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,278
Tell him you were only kidding, Tom.

41
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:11,841
How do you want them this time:
Up or down?

42
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:55,188
Three for me, too. Three skins.

43
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,951
- Hello there.
- How's it going?

44
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,425
How are you?

45
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,622
Hit you. There you are.

46
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:04,063
- Hit me again.
- Hit you. There's one.

47
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,964
Hit you again. There you go.

48
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:18,079
Hey, Putty Nose.

49
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:23,207
All right. I'll be back in a minute, boys.

50
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,785
Hello, boys. What's up?

51
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:29,449
- We've got something.
- Really?

52
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:31,857
Fine. I'll bet you a nickel.

53
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,772
- Where'd you get them?
- Wentworth Avenue.

54
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,864
How much are they worth?

55
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,507
Not much. Just cheap watches.

56
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:52,173
- Cheap watches? $1 apiece.
- Yeah, and there's six of them, too.

57
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:54,842
I don't know what I can do with them.
They're hot.

58
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:58,648
Come on. Quit stalling, Putty Nose.
You know how to sell them.

59
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,382
You're too smart.

60
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:05,115
- I'll see what I can do with them.
- How much do we get?

61
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:08,826
What do you say to 50 cents
for each of them?

62
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:13,301
- 50 cents?
- I ain't cheating you. That's a good price.

63
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:18,205
I have to take all the risk,
and maybe I can't sell them at all.

64
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:20,105
Give us the 50 cents.

65
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,079
You know old Putty Nose always
plays on the square with you, don't you?

66
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,708
- This is only two bits.
- Yeah, and this is only a nickel.

67
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,815
- My mistake.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:33,445
All right.

69
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:36,389
Your brother owes me a month's dues
to the club, don't you?

70
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,428
- That's right, Tom.
- So we're calling that square, see?

71
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,759
- That's all right, isn't it?
- Sure.

72
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,495
You've done a good stroke of business.

73
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,962
And if you find anything more...

74
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,595
you'll just remember old Putty Nose,
won't you?

75
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,368
Okay. Let's scram.

76
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,673
What do we want with
a couple of young squirts like them for?

77
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,105
They ain't gonna be so bad.

78
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,812
They won't expect much of a cut.

79
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:38,215
- Hey there, Tom.
- Hello, Putty Nose.

80
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,549
Hello, boys.

81
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:43,082
Are you alone?

82
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,284
I'm always alone when I'm with Matt.

83
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:49,123
You looking for a sock on the button?

84
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,727
I was afraid you might have
brought Mike with you.

85
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,536
That sucker.
He's too busy going to school.

86
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:00,369
He's learning how to be poor.

87
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:05,807
Ain't he working
on the streetcars anymore?

88
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:10,011
Sure. He's a ding-ding in the daytime,
goes to school at night.

89
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:13,247
What do you want us for, Putty?

90
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,218
Something sweet.

91
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:22,928
Remember how I always said...

92
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,303
when I got something good, I'd cut you in?

93
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:49,685
Now, Dutch here knows the whole layout.

94
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,395
We've been casing the joint
for a whole week.

95
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:57,928
- How about the cops?
- You ain't afraid of cops.

96
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,464
There ain't gonna be no trouble...

97
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:04,370
and if there is,
I promise you that I'll protect you.

98
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,406
Now, Limpy here will be lookout.

99
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,348
The place is dead at night, anyhow.

100
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,680
Well, are you on?

101
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:22,150
- We ain't never done nothing so big.
- '<i>'</i>Big'<i>'</i> is right.

102
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:25,250
I'm giving you a break, like I promised.

103
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,262
Furs is worth plenty nowadays.

104
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,899
How about you, Tom?

105
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:37,235
- It's kind of new stuff for me.
- You gotta grow up sometime.

106
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,238
Wait a minute.

107
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,239
Christmas present from Santa Claus.

108
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,678
With best wishes
for a prosperous new year.

109
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,294
- I'm scared stiff.
- Come on, ain't nothing to be scared of.

110
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:37,526
Is that so?
Look at you, you're shaking yourself.

111
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:57,377
Take it off me, will you?

112
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,804
Stop!

113
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,411
You tried to get away, did you?

114
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,413
They got Limpy Larry.

115
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:50,466
Stop there!

116
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,502
- Where's that big loony?
- Where's Putty? We knocked off a...

117
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,043
Yeah, I know all about it.

118
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,778
Putty Nose beat it.
You better lay low for a while.

119
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,141
The heat's on.

120
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:39,779
But Putty Nose got us into this.
He promised to see us through.

121
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,483
Why, that dirty, no-good,
yellow-bellied stool.

122
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,123
I'm gonna give it to him right in the head
the first time I see him.

123
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,686
Yeah? You and who else?

124
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,679
My Larry.

125
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,954
He was a good boy.

126
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,562
Larry got what he asked for. I warned him.

127
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,260
He was a no-good boy.

128
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,164
My Larry was a good boy.

129
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:34,772
He got into bad company, that's all.

130
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,909
Come here, Tommy boy.

131
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,039
I'm so glad you came, Tommy.

132
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:44,713
Mrs. Dalton will be pleased to see
some of Larry's nicer friends.

133
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,340
'<i>'</i>U.S. Declares war.'<i>'</i> Read all about it!

134
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,294
Wait a minute, Tom. Here comes Mike.

135
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,260
Extra! Read all about it.

136
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:37,795
You should come on home with me, Molly.
I don't know just how to tell Mom.

137
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,135
All right, Mike.

138
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:47,012
That sister of yours
ain't getting any bargain in Mike.

139
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,777
How come he ain't working?

140
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:51,843
I guess he got fired
for snatching too many nickels.

141
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,378
- They look like something's happened.
- Come on, we gotta see Paddy.

142
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,592
You don't need to stall
with Paddy Ryan, Tom.

143
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:03,159
I've been watching you ever since
you bought your first drink from me.

144
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:05,393
I know what you been doing.

145
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,691
You see, Paddy, it's like this.

146
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,933
We delivered some cigars today.
Must be worth about $2,500.

147
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,100
Took them to a place on 63rd
and was told to put them in the back.

148
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,169
- We could lift them easy tonight.
- But we don't know what to do with them.

149
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,977
You sell cigars, don't you?

150
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:30,857
Not that kind. Can't afford it.

151
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:36,587
I've got my own system, boys,
but being a fence ain't part of it.

152
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:39,793
- We thought maybe you know somebody.
- Maybe I do.

153
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:49,802
You might take them there.

154
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:53,376
- I'll call up and say you're coming.
- Thanks, Paddy.

155
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:58,676
Wait a minute.

156
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:08,096
If you get in a jam, give me a ring.
You'll find out Paddy Ryan's your friend.

157
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,159
Thanks, Paddy.

158
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,565
Why do you want to front for us?
We ain't never done nothing for you.

159
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,000
Maybe not.

160
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:18,568
But I may need a friend myself sometime.

161
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,332
I'm older than you...

162
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,901
and I've learned that nobody can do much
without somebody else.

163
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,314
Remember this, boys:
You gotta have friends.

164
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:32,782
I've been watching and hearing about you,
and I've been worried.

165
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:36,791
I was worried when you got mixed up
with that two-timer Putty Nose.

166
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,393
Such guys are dangerous.

167
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,501
I'm glad you come to me.

168
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,136
As far as I'm concerned,
there's only two kinds of people:

169
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,536
Right and wrong.

170
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,498
Now, I think you're right.

171
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:57,909
You'll find that I am, unless you cross me.

172
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:06,582
That's swell.

173
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,758
Don't cry. Everything will be all right.

174
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,531
Hello, Ma.

175
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:28,705
Tommy boy.
You won't leave me, will you, Tommy?

176
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:31,575
You're all I've got left now, Tommy boy.

177
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:34,878
What's the matter, Ma? What's up?

178
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,376
Mike's enlisted.

179
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,221
Enlisted? In the Army?

180
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:44,653
- In the Marines.
- But you won't go, Tommy.

181
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:48,287
Promise me you won't go.
You're just a baby.

182
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,459
Now, listen, Ma...

183
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:53,524
If your pa was alive,
I wouldn't care so much.

184
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,462
Promise me, Tommy.

185
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:00,573
I won't go, Ma. When's he going?

186
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,540
As soon as he gets his call.

187
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:06,342
He's up packing now.

188
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:10,582
Go up and see him, Tommy.

189
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,188
We ought to be very proud of him.

190
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,331
- Hello, Mike.
- Hello, Tom.

191
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:30,496
I'm glad you came. I suppose you've heard.

192
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:32,663
Yeah. Kind of rushing it, ain't you?

193
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:36,006
Well, Tom, when your country needs you,
she needs you.

194
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,872
I suppose you think I ought to go, too.

195
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,181
No. Maybe it was selfish of me, Tom...

196
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,754
but somebody's got to stay here
and take care of Ma.

197
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:51,623
You earn more money than I do,
and they'd have called me first anyway.

198
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,762
- You always did get all the breaks.
- Don't take it like that, Tom.

199
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:59,798
You've got to be
the man of the family now.

200
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,338
And while we're on the subject, I wish
you'd try to stay home a little more.

201
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:11,908
- I gotta work, ain't I?
- Sure.

202
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:24,418
Listen, I was in a place today,
and I heard somebody say something.

203
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,624
- What of it?
- Well, they were saying...

204
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:31,521
It seemed as though they were
pointing a finger at you and Matt.

205
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,091
Who was?
What rat would say anything about me...

206
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,364
Now take it easy.

207
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,263
You're always hearing things.

208
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,434
You'll get too much in your nose someday
and wonder how you got it.

209
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,308
For crying out loud,
I heard some guys talking about you...

210
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:46,438
saying you were in on some crooked work.

211
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,676
What am I supposed to do? Run?

212
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:55,083
You ain't asking me, you're telling me.

213
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:57,858
And I don't know a thing, see?

214
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,690
All I've got to say is that
you've got a good job now.

215
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:03,026
You don't need these rats
you're running with.

216
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:06,261
You want me to go to night school
and read poems.

217
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:09,832
I've been hearing a few things myself.

218
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:12,635
- There's nothing to hear about me.
- That's all you know.

219
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:15,471
You ain't so smart.
Books don't hide everything.

220
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:19,344
- You're a liar. You're covering up.
- Covering up for what? For you?

221
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:21,780
- You're nothing but a sneak thief.
- What did you say?

222
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,253
You heard me, a petty larceny sneak thief.
Robbing the streetcar company.

223
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:06,917
Don't you think that
booze ain't gonna be valuable.

224
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,387
I heard today that
alcohol's gone to $30 a gallon.

225
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,594
The real McCoy's hard to get.

226
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:21,699
All you gotta do
when you deliver a good shipment...

227
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,432
is size up the layout and let me know.

228
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,771
I can use some of it.

229
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:33,780
I know two or three others
that'll buy all that I can't handle.

230
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:38,152
It means real dough, a three-way split.

231
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:41,982
I said we'd get together sometime,
didn't I?

232
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:44,787
Well, the time has come now.

233
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,842
Grab the rope.
One jerk to start, and two to stop.

234
00:28:24,552 --> 00:28:26,452
Thanks, Hymie.

235
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:34,550
There.

236
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:39,498
- Are you satisfied?
- I'll say.

237
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,503
Pretty soft, wasn't it?

238
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:45,829
How do you like playing with Paddy?

239
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:49,604
- I wonder what to do with so much dough.
- You ain't started.

240
00:28:50,178 --> 00:28:52,043
I'll make big shots out of you yet.

241
00:28:52,113 --> 00:28:54,809
- Anything you say goes for me, Paddy.
- Me, too.

242
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,280
And here's to us.

243
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:06,182
31.5 inches.

244
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,131
Don't forget, plenty of room in there.

245
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:14,635
Sir. Here's where you need the room.
Such a muscle.

246
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:16,795
Make it snappy
or you'll find out what it's for.

247
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:20,204
- Yeah, come on. Let's get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:23,805
22.5 inches.

249
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,508
Did you read about that big robbery
at the booze warehouse?

250
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:33,450
42.5 inches.

251
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:40,386
- Right under their very noses.
- Yeah, a guy was just telling me about it.

252
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:45,023
33.5 inches.

253
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,165
If those men get away with that,
they'll be rich for life.

254
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,867
37.5 inches.

255
00:29:57,445 --> 00:30:01,814
Did you read what it said
in the papers? 150,000.

256
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,375
150,000 inches.

257
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:06,014
Dollars.

258
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:09,153
Why don't you two mugs
get an adding machine?

259
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,022
All through now, gentlemen. Thank you.

260
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,522
Don't forget what I told you.
Plenty of room there.

261
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:17,827
Yeah, and remember: Six buttons.

262
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,763
Be careful, Matt, or you're going to
cut the nose right off of you.

263
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:40,047
- Lf it ain't Mr. Tom and Mr. Matt.
- Hello, George. How's business?

264
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,816
- Big night.
- Good.

265
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:53,195
Hey, stoop, that's got gears!
It ain't no Ford!

266
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:54,866
Okay, boss.

267
00:31:20,094 --> 00:31:22,961
Mr. Powers, Mr. Doyle. Alone as usual?

268
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:25,932
I am, but Matt's all fixed up.
He's got me with him.

269
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,524
The night's young yet.

270
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:31,003
- You'll wind up with something.
- Yeah, with the morning paper.

271
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,316
- Couple of lightweights.
- Yeah, flat tires.

272
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,377
Why don't you send them
home to their mothers?

273
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:17,009
- They're no good to the joint anymore.
- And the ladies, too?

274
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,676
Don't be silly.

275
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:32,993
How about something with ice in it?

276
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,501
Well, we're with friends.

277
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:46,507
Yeah, I know it. I'm one of them.

278
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:51,650
Hello, baby.

279
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:55,522
- What are you going to have?
- Anything you say, big boy.

280
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:59,518
You're a swell dish.
I think I'm going to go for you.

281
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:03,621
- Look at what I got measured for.
- I don't even know you're here.

282
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,733
Come on.

283
00:33:19,113 --> 00:33:20,876
Then it's a deal?

284
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:24,679
If you can assure me
my name will be protected.

285
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,448
You'll be protected all over the place.

286
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:29,689
Hello, boys.

287
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:34,257
You can take off those clothes.
You got new jobs.

288
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:41,602
First, meet Mr. Leehman.

289
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:46,598
These are the two lads
I was telling you about.

290
00:33:47,975 --> 00:33:49,442
Sit down, boys.

291
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:55,846
How do you like the brewery business?

292
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:58,852
- We don't know nothing about it.
- You will.

293
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,547
You're in it now.

294
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:04,016
Mr. Leehman and I got it all fixed.

295
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:08,250
Mr. Leehman owns that big brewery
over on Union Avenue.

296
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:16,668
- But that's been closed since...
- Yeah. It's going to open up.

297
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,732
You spoke of a rather remarkable man
from the West Side.

298
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:24,775
Nails Nathan.

299
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,373
- Paddy, is Nails throwing in with us?
- He'll be here any minute.

300
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,848
I don't believe I'm acquainted
with the gentleman.

301
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:37,755
Then you're the only man in town
that ain't.

302
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,453
At least everybody's heard of him, boys.

303
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:47,192
Believe me, Mr. Leehman,
when Nails and his mob start on a job...

304
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,295
it's already done.

305
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,498
That Schemer Burns' crowd
tries to muscle in on us...

306
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,576
I pity them.

307
00:34:57,645 --> 00:35:02,548
You understand that my desire is merely
to furnish a better grade of beer...

308
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,585
than the working man can now obtain...

309
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:07,815
- under the present, unfortunate...
- In your hat.

310
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,087
And again in your hat, mister.

311
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,355
I've heard that north wind blow before.

312
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:17,625
If you're in this, you're in for the coins,
same as the rest of us.

313
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,565
- Gentlemen, meet Nails Nathan.
- Born Samuel.

314
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:22,895
Tom Powers, glad to know you.

315
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,636
And you're Matt Doyle.

316
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,832
- How are you? Sit down, fellas.
- How'd you know?

317
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,433
Know all about you.
Paddy has been talking.

318
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,909
Meet Mr. Leehman, Nails.

319
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:34,209
Tickled pink. Don't take offense
at anything I say, Mr. Leehman.

320
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:37,774
If we're in this racket together,
we got to keep the cheaters off, right?

321
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:39,012
My name is not to appear...

322
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:41,577
Don't worry.
We won't use it in our advertising.

323
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:44,454
Paddy, the mob's all ready
by the time you can open.

324
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:48,393
Got some swell routes laid out for you,
and the stock's all marked.

325
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,197
You mean,
you have the customers all signed up?

326
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:53,290
- Signed up?
- Yes, sir.

327
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:55,833
Signed up or sealed up.

328
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,530
Tom and Matt here
is the official signers and sealers.

329
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:02,201
- The trouble squad.
- And if they need any help...

330
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:06,212
Nails has got some pretty handy boys
with their gloves all oiled.

331
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:07,871
Dear me, I'm afraid this means...

332
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:11,385
It means they buy our beer
or they don't buy any beer.

333
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:24,328
All right, Dutch, get going.

334
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:26,989
And don't take any back talk
from those speakies.

335
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:30,970
Tell them, '<i>'</i>Here's the beer you ordered.'<i>'</i>
If they doubt you, call Matt and Tom.

336
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:33,438
All right, Matt, Tom, get going.

337
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:02,431
- Hello, Steve. How's business?
- Business?

338
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,664
Business is on the bum.

339
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:07,900
That's with telling us
you only took two kegs of beer last trip...

340
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,240
- but now you don't want any at all.
- Business is on the bum.

341
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:15,105
Give us a couple of beers.
That'll help a little.

342
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:29,460
- That ain't our beer.
- Where'd you get this slop?

343
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,124
It's good, ain't it?
And it's cheaper than yours.

344
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:34,690
How much you paying for this stuff?

345
00:37:35,136 --> 00:37:37,661
- Two bits a glass.
- All right. Screw.

346
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:43,539
I thought so.
You can sell ours for the same price.

347
00:37:57,224 --> 00:37:59,158
Get your hands off that!

348
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:01,057
Somebody's got to protect
your customers.

349
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:04,393
What can I do? I can't help it
if I have to buy from Schemer Burns.

350
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:07,992
- They tell me the same thing that you do.
- You're yellow.

351
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:11,896
Please, you ain't gonna slug me, are you?

352
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:15,875
Maybe not today.
But I'm telling you this for the last time.

353
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:17,911
When Dutch comes,
he will leave some beer.

354
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:20,812
You're going to take it
and kick in with the dough.

355
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,874
If you don't, somebody will come and kick
your teeth out one at a time. Get me?

356
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:28,217
You'll be needing some right away.
How many should we leave?

357
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:31,986
- Two kegs.
- You hear that, Dutch? Bring in five kegs.

358
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,196
'<i>'</i>Mr. And Mrs. Patrick J. Ryan.'<i>'</i>

359
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,865
'<i>'</i>Mr. And Mrs. Bernard Grogan.'<i>'</i>

360
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:54,774
'<i>'</i>Welcome home, Michael Powers.'<i>'</i>

361
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,843
'<i>'</i>Samuel Nathan'<i>'</i>?

362
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:05,421
I never heard of him.

363
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:10,155
Nails Nathan. One of Tom's new friends.

364
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,434
What's Tom doing now, Pat?

365
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:16,660
Mother said something
about a political job.

366
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:19,365
Yeah? And that ain't all.

367
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:22,840
He and Matt have been running around...

368
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,141
with a couple of girls
at the Washington Arms Hotel.

369
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:30,613
Now, the worst part of it all
is that he's been lying to his mother.

370
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:34,120
He's leaving her think
that he's made an honest success.

371
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,724
Why, sure it's only a question of time
when he's going to be caught.

372
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,590
And then he'll be
after breaking her poor heart.

373
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,356
But what's he doing?

374
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,430
Beer. Bootleg.

375
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,557
He's one of Paddy Ryan's gang.
But that's not all.

376
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,965
Sure, they stop at nothing.

377
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:56,142
You either take their beer,
or they put you on the spot.

378
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,179
I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business.

379
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:02,108
Why, only last week...

380
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:10,590
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

381
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:19,832
That's nice of you, Tommy...

382
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,528
but I don't think
Mike will be able to drink any.

383
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:25,629
It's the best beer in town.
It'll do him good.

384
00:40:28,742 --> 00:40:30,607
Dinner's all ready, Michael.

385
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:34,236
- Shall I help you in?
- No, Mother. I can make it.

386
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,478
I'll be getting along. I'll see you all later.

387
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:41,015
Bye-bye.

388
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,773
How's the meat, Mikey?

389
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:05,835
Fine, Ma.

390
00:41:08,149 --> 00:41:12,051
I wish you'd eat more.
Try some of this cabbage.

391
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,816
I've had plenty, Ma.

392
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:26,197
Say, we haven't drunk to your health yet.

393
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,167
This is a swell celebration.

394
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,430
There you are, Mike.

395
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:43,174
- That's enough for you, Ma.
- Put a head on that, will you?

396
00:41:46,554 --> 00:41:47,782
Miss Powers.

397
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:56,994
Well, here's to you, Mike.

398
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:11,034
Why don't you drink, Mike?

399
00:42:12,813 --> 00:42:14,804
Come on, it's only beer.

400
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,184
I don't want any, Matt.

401
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:22,212
What's eating you?

402
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:26,952
I'm not interfering with your drinking.
If you want to drink it, go on.

403
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:29,461
If I don't want to, I don't have to.

404
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,738
So beer ain't good enough for you?

405
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:43,740
You think I'd care
if it was just beer in that keg?

406
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,507
I know what's in it.
I know what you've been doing...

407
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,707
how you got those clothes
and those new cars.

408
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:52,377
You've been telling Ma you're in politics,
that you're on the city payroll.

409
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:54,580
Pat Burke told me everything.

410
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,179
You murderers!

411
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,425
There's not only beer in that keg,
there's beer and blood.

412
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,983
The blood of men!

413
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:19,406
You ain't changed a bit.

414
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,784
Besides, your hands ain't so clean.
You killed and liked it.

415
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:27,716
You didn't get them medals
for holding hands with Germans.

416
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:31,087
Please, he ain't himself.
He don't know what he's talking about.

417
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:34,025
This trip's been too much
for the poor soul.

418
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:36,324
Lord have pity on him.

419
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:37,989
Please, Tommy.

420
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:42,329
Come on, Matt. Let's get out of here
before I go screwy, too.

421
00:43:42,403 --> 00:43:45,133
Don't go away, Tommy. Don't be angry.

422
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:49,207
You can send my clothes
to the Washington Arms Hotel.

423
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:12,763
Get up, lazybones.
What are you gonna do, sleep all day?

424
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:15,727
Button up. I can sleep as long as I like.

425
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:19,465
That's a fine way to talk to me
after I cooked this lovely breakfast for you.

426
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:21,598
With my own lily-white hands.

427
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:25,940
Lake View 8515. Right.

428
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:32,712
- Hello?
- Hello, is Tom there?

429
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:37,314
I just called his apartment. They said
he stepped across the hall for breakfast.

430
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,789
Nails Nathan.

431
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:43,050
Just a minute. Tom, it's for you.

432
00:44:43,697 --> 00:44:45,722
- Who is it?
- Nails Nathan.

433
00:45:02,682 --> 00:45:04,650
- Hello, kid.
- Hello, Tom.

434
00:45:05,385 --> 00:45:07,785
- What's the matter, kid?
- Nothing.

435
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,892
Only the dame's beginning
to get on my nerves, that's all.

436
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:19,354
Listen, I'm getting fed up
on these rubber checks bouncing in.

437
00:45:19,432 --> 00:45:23,232
We're laying down good beer and
getting nothing but a lot of bum paper.

438
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,966
I got one this morning for $1,200
from that Pete over on Kedzie Avenue.

439
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,668
Get over there. I want that dough.

440
00:45:30,176 --> 00:45:34,169
Cash or his heart.
If you can't bring in one, bring in the other.

441
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,913
I'll bring you both. Leave it to me, kid.

442
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:41,986
All right.

443
00:45:42,388 --> 00:45:44,754
Come on in, Matt. Shake a leg.

444
00:45:45,759 --> 00:45:48,023
Nails wants us to do him a favor.

445
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:49,894
In a minute.

446
00:45:52,732 --> 00:45:54,495
It's all ready, Tom.

447
00:45:55,034 --> 00:45:58,993
- Ain't you got a drink in the house?
- Not before breakfast, dear.

448
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:00,538
I didn't ask you for any lip.

449
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:03,542
- I asked you if you got a drink.
- I know, Tom...

450
00:46:04,043 --> 00:46:07,444
- but I wish...
- There you go with that '<i>'</i>wishing'<i>'</i> stuff.

451
00:46:09,682 --> 00:46:11,946
I wish you was a wishing well...

452
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:15,248
so that I could tie a bucket to you
and sink you.

453
00:46:16,923 --> 00:46:19,653
Maybe you found someone you like better.

454
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:49,748
How goes it, babe?

455
00:47:03,803 --> 00:47:05,498
- Going south?
- Yes.

456
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:09,997
But I'm not accustomed
to riding with strangers.

457
00:47:13,913 --> 00:47:16,074
We're not going to be strangers.

458
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:20,374
- How far are you going?
- Pretty far. Near Jackson Park.

459
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:24,821
- Is that out of your way?
- No.

460
00:47:25,558 --> 00:47:28,083
My chauffeur's just crazy
about long drives.

461
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:30,990
Step on it, James.

462
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,726
Well, do I look good to you?

463
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:39,670
- You sure do.
- I feel flattered.

464
00:47:40,306 --> 00:47:43,469
You know,
you're not the worst I've seen, either.

465
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:52,581
- From Chicago?
- Not exactly. I came from Texas.

466
00:47:53,853 --> 00:47:56,845
- Where you living?
- The Congress Hotel.

467
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,282
If you're a stranger here,
Tom and me will show you the town.

468
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,385
Stick to your driving, mug.

469
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:10,393
Say, you can let me off here.

470
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,768
I'm going to meet my friends
on the corner.

471
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:25,778
Could I see you again later?

472
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,787
I'd be happy to have you
call me sometime.

473
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:30,852
I mean, later today.

474
00:48:31,357 --> 00:48:34,520
I'll think it over. Give me
your phone number and I'll call you.

475
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:37,586
All right, babe. Yards 3771.

476
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:43,130
I'll remember it.
And in the meantime, thanks.

477
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,668
- My name is Gwen. Gwen Allen.
- And mine's Tom Powers.

478
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:52,177
- Yeah, and mine is Matt.
- He ain't got a name, just a number.

479
00:49:07,026 --> 00:49:09,824
She's a honey. I could go for her myself.

480
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:12,830
What do you mean,
you could go for her yourself?

481
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:15,333
You could go for
an 80-year-old chick with rheumatism.

482
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:17,369
When are you going to see her?

483
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:21,302
- She's going to call me.
- Find out if she's got a friend.

484
00:49:22,475 --> 00:49:25,706
What do you want with her friend?
You got Mamie, ain't you?

485
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:29,171
Ain't you going to kiss your little baby?

486
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:33,478
- You got Kitty, ain't you?
- I ain't going to have her much longer.

487
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,681
I'm fed up. You can tell her so for me.

488
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,051
Step on the gas, will you?

489
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:46,725
Max, George, quick.

490
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:52,269
Delighted to see you, Mr. Nathan.

491
00:49:52,338 --> 00:49:54,499
- How are you, Joe?
- Fine, thank you.

492
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,098
Where would you like to sit?

493
00:49:56,175 --> 00:49:58,234
Where do I always sit?
Right at the ringside.

494
00:49:58,311 --> 00:50:00,609
- May be full up there.
- We can fix that, sir.

495
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,979
Max, George, fix a table immediately
at the railing for Mr. Nathan.

496
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,611
Great. The best is none too good tonight.
This is a wedding celebration.

497
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:09,154
- Really?
- Yep.

498
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:11,986
Matt's decided
to take something lawful: A wife.

499
00:50:12,525 --> 00:50:15,085
- That's something to celebrate about.
- I should say so.

500
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:18,961
- Meet Mr. And Mrs. Doyle.
- We're honored, I assure you.

501
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:23,826
- Let's dance while they're fixing the tables.
- This way, please.

502
00:50:28,741 --> 00:50:30,436
- Hiya, Nails.
- Hello, Tom.

503
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,274
- How are you, Mr. Nathan?
- Harry, making money?

504
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,844
- Right this way, please.
- Hello, Jim. How are you?

505
00:50:57,003 --> 00:50:59,995
- Are you as happy as I am, Matt?
- Sure, honey.

506
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:06,211
You fellows don't know what it means
to a girl, getting married.

507
00:51:06,412 --> 00:51:09,677
You knew all the time
I was going to marry you, didn't you?

508
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:11,640
Of course I did.

509
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:14,645
I was just thinking of Tom and Kitty.

510
00:51:16,923 --> 00:51:21,053
Well, they're different.
I guess Tom ain't the marrying kind.

511
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:23,289
No, I guess not.

512
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:56,290
Are you sure that was old Putty Nose?

513
00:51:56,395 --> 00:51:59,694
- I ought to know him when I see him.
- Sure you know him.

514
00:51:59,765 --> 00:52:01,892
I suppose you'd like
to put in with him again.

515
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:05,199
That's the Fagin that
put something over on you, ain't it?

516
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:08,272
I had to laugh when I heard about that.

517
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,709
That guy's going to get you again.
He thinks you're soft.

518
00:52:13,412 --> 00:52:16,609
- He ain't going to get me.
- We don't want any part of him.

519
00:52:17,617 --> 00:52:21,781
I haven't got a thing to say, boys.
But they got the Indian sign on you, Tom.

520
00:52:21,954 --> 00:52:25,048
- He thinks you're a cinch.
- In a pig's eye.

521
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:27,486
That McGonagall ain't got a chance.

522
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:42,872
Take care of the women, Nails.

523
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:46,275
You're not going out
in the cold, dark night, are you?

524
00:52:46,412 --> 00:52:49,210
Nails will see that you get home.
We got a little job to do.

525
00:52:49,282 --> 00:52:50,772
Come on, Matt.

526
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,151
You're not gonna leave me tonight, Matt?

527
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:01,886
There's something we forgot to do, honey.
I'll be home later.

528
00:53:03,963 --> 00:53:05,260
Come on.

529
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:10,800
Where's he going?

530
00:53:10,903 --> 00:53:13,838
They're just walking around the block
to cool themselves off.

531
00:53:13,906 --> 00:53:16,397
What are you worrying about? Sit down.

532
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:23,046
Have it ready at 8:00. Fill it with gas.

533
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,907
I'm going on a long trip.

534
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:41,524
Well, if it ain't Tom Powers and Matt, too.
How are you, boys?

535
00:53:42,435 --> 00:53:45,666
- Been out of town?
- Yeah, I was down home, visiting.

536
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:49,964
- Got a little drink for us, Putty?
- Sure, Tom.

537
00:53:50,443 --> 00:53:52,809
But I can't let you in just now.

538
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:57,478
You see, I've got a Jane inside.
I'll bring it right out to you.

539
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:59,541
Wait a minute, Putty Nose.

540
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,248
- We got words for you.
- What's up, Tom?

541
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,125
We got a little business to settle,
Jane or no Jane.

542
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,557
You ain't sore, are you, Tom?
I've always been your friend.

543
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:16,395
Sure. You taught us how to cheat,
steal, and kill. Then you lammed out on us.

544
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:19,438
If it hadn't been for you,
we might have been on the level.

545
00:54:19,505 --> 00:54:22,736
Sure. We might have been
ding-dings on a streetcar.

546
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:24,435
Come on.

547
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:37,054
A Jane, huh?
There ain't no one here but him.

548
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,252
I thought so.

549
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:42,387
Why, you dirty, double-crossing...

550
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:50,526
What are you squawking about?
You got plenty more coming.

551
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:58,438
What are you gonna do?

552
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,876
I don't want to die.

553
00:55:05,117 --> 00:55:07,176
So you don't want to die?

554
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:13,756
Tommy, don't you remember
you and Matt...

555
00:55:13,826 --> 00:55:17,762
how you used to be just kids
and how we were friends?

556
00:55:19,465 --> 00:55:23,401
You won't let him, Matt.
I'll do anything for you from now on.

557
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,632
Ain't you got a heart, Matty boy?

558
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:28,333
Don't you remember
how I used to play to you?

559
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:33,071
And didn't I always stick up for you?
I ain't got this coming.

560
00:55:34,747 --> 00:55:37,045
Please, Matt, don't let him.

561
00:55:37,683 --> 00:55:39,583
I ain't a bad fellow, really.

562
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:42,883
Tommy, don't. Ain't you got a heart?

563
00:55:43,656 --> 00:55:45,886
Tell me you won't let him, Matt, will you?

564
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:50,327
You remember that song I used to sing?
That song I taught you?

565
00:55:50,529 --> 00:55:51,928
You remember, Tommy.

566
00:55:51,997 --> 00:55:56,229
Back in the club,
how you kids used to laugh at that song.

567
00:56:25,431 --> 00:56:27,228
Guess I'll call up Gwen.

568
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:30,828
She ought to be home by now.

569
00:56:52,324 --> 00:56:53,655
Let me make you a cup of tea.

570
00:56:53,726 --> 00:56:55,921
I got to be getting back on the job
in a minute.

571
00:56:55,995 --> 00:57:00,898
My, but it's good to see you again.
I was beginning to think I'd lost you.

572
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:03,702
You can't lose me that easy.

573
00:57:06,605 --> 00:57:08,004
Poor Michael.

574
00:57:08,073 --> 00:57:11,338
I'm afraid he's working himself
into an early grave.

575
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:15,879
Days on the cars, school at night,
and studying in between.

576
00:57:15,948 --> 00:57:18,246
Listen, Ma,
I came over to give you something.

577
00:57:18,317 --> 00:57:20,148
Here, take this.

578
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:23,244
When you need more, just say so.
I'm making plenty.

579
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:25,483
You're a good boy, Tommy, but I can't.

580
00:57:25,558 --> 00:57:27,924
- Take it.
- Mike wouldn't like it.

581
00:57:27,993 --> 00:57:30,962
- Mike ain't got nothing to say about it.
- No?

582
00:57:35,134 --> 00:57:37,568
Listen to me.
I've got something important to say.

583
00:57:37,636 --> 00:57:39,900
Keep it to yourself.
Nobody wants your two cents.

584
00:57:39,972 --> 00:57:43,305
I don't want you two boys fighting.
It ain't right for two brothers.

585
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:46,037
There won't be fighting.
Only, I don't need his preaching.

586
00:57:46,111 --> 00:57:49,308
- What is this, Ma?
- Tommy gave it to me to buy some things.

587
00:57:49,381 --> 00:57:52,214
- Ain't that nice of him?
- It's more than you can do.

588
00:57:52,284 --> 00:57:54,252
We don't want your money.
I'll look after Ma.

589
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,982
- On two bits a week?
- Ma don't drink champagne.

590
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,957
How do you know?
I used to dance when I was a girl.

591
00:58:00,025 --> 00:58:03,756
I won't argue with you, and
I can't tell you all I'd like to in front of Ma.

592
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:06,627
But get an earful of this:
You ain't welcome in this house.

593
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:08,633
That's blood money. We want no part of it.

594
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:13,070
- Hiding behind Ma's skirts, like always.
- Better than hiding behind a machine gun.

595
00:58:16,408 --> 00:58:18,035
You're too smart.

596
00:58:19,879 --> 00:58:22,973
- I'm going, Ma.
- And don't forget your change.

597
00:58:23,048 --> 00:58:25,608
- Money don't mean nothing to me.
- No, I guess not.

598
00:58:25,684 --> 00:58:28,778
But with no heart or brains,
it's all you've got. You'll need it.

599
00:58:28,854 --> 00:58:31,015
Why you sneaking, stooling...

600
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:46,897
Michael, why did you hit him?

601
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:53,168
I may leave town next week.

602
00:58:53,913 --> 00:58:55,847
You don't care, do you?

603
00:59:02,454 --> 00:59:06,220
When I first met you,
I sort of figured you was on the make.

604
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:09,256
Not much. You know what I mean.

605
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:11,521
And besides that...

606
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:15,462
I figured you was sort of different, too.

607
00:59:15,868 --> 00:59:19,133
That is, different from the kind of girls
I was used to.

608
00:59:20,906 --> 00:59:25,605
I don't go in for these long-winded things,
but with me, it was always yes or no.

609
00:59:26,445 --> 00:59:28,777
And I could never figure you out.

610
00:59:29,114 --> 00:59:31,878
- Now can you?
- No.

611
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:36,080
But I guess I ain't your kind.

612
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:40,355
- I think I better call it quits.
- Don't be like that, Tommy...

613
00:59:40,726 --> 00:59:43,627
because I '<i>'</i>go for you,'<i>'</i> as you say.

614
00:59:45,097 --> 00:59:47,327
Maybe too much.

615
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:53,062
You know, all my friends...

616
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,140
think that things are different between us
than they are.

617
00:59:59,678 --> 01:00:01,908
They figure they know me pretty well...

618
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:04,211
and don't think I'd go
for a merry-go-round.

619
01:00:04,283 --> 01:00:07,411
Do you think
I'm giving you a merry-go-round?

620
01:00:09,722 --> 01:00:13,021
- No, l...
- Then do you want things to be different...

621
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:15,754
to please your boyfriends?

622
01:00:16,128 --> 01:00:19,097
No, but how long can a guy hold out?

623
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:21,296
I'm gonna go screwy.

624
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,200
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna blow.

625
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:27,797
You're a spoiled boy, Tommy.

626
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:31,774
You want things,
and you're not content until you get them.

627
01:00:32,611 --> 01:00:37,014
Or maybe I'm spoiled, too.
Maybe I feel that way, too.

628
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:42,017
But you're not running away from me.
Come here.

629
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:58,194
Now you stay put,
if you know what that means.

630
01:01:03,942 --> 01:01:06,103
My bashful boy.

631
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:11,142
You are different, Tommy.

632
01:01:12,217 --> 01:01:13,548
Very different.

633
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:19,253
And I've discovered
it isn't only a difference in manner...

634
01:01:19,324 --> 01:01:21,019
and outward appearances.

635
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,120
It's a difference in basic character.

636
01:01:25,197 --> 01:01:26,824
The men I know...

637
01:01:27,566 --> 01:01:29,864
and I've known dozens of them...

638
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:32,430
they're so nice...

639
01:01:33,238 --> 01:01:35,638
so polished, so considerate.

640
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:41,078
Most women like that type.
I guess they're afraid of the other kind.

641
01:01:42,381 --> 01:01:44,144
I thought I was, too.

642
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:46,780
But you're so strong.

643
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:49,685
You don't give, you take.

644
01:01:50,255 --> 01:01:52,849
Tommy, I could love you to death.

645
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:02,758
Oh, nuts.

646
01:02:16,882 --> 01:02:18,179
Is Tom here?

647
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:21,743
Nails is dead.

648
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:30,128
- Who killed him?
- Nobody. His horse.

649
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:34,226
He was thrown off in the park,
kicked in the head.

650
01:03:22,781 --> 01:03:26,478
- You got that horse that killed Nails?
- You mean Rajah?

651
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:29,681
He bad animal. Terrible.

652
01:03:29,755 --> 01:03:31,416
Yeah, what's he worth?

653
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:34,219
Spirited horse.
I told Mr. Nathan not to ride him.

654
01:03:34,293 --> 01:03:35,885
What's he worth?

655
01:03:37,196 --> 01:03:40,131
He could be bought for $1,000.
You see, it's...

656
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,690
- Never mind. Here.
- Where's he at?

657
01:03:45,237 --> 01:03:46,966
Stall Number 3.

658
01:03:52,044 --> 01:03:53,773
Stay where you are.

659
01:04:46,164 --> 01:04:48,359
Right now, we ain't got a chance.

660
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:53,268
Since Nails has gone, his mob has
scattered. They're ten-to-one against us.

661
01:04:53,338 --> 01:04:54,965
Look at this dump.

662
01:04:55,173 --> 01:04:58,836
Four pineapples tossed at us in two days,
and the brewery set fire.

663
01:04:59,077 --> 01:05:01,068
I'm telling you, they got us on the run.

664
01:05:01,146 --> 01:05:04,445
- Not me. I ain't running. I ain't yellow.
- Who said you was?

665
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,947
I ain't talking about that.

666
01:05:08,553 --> 01:05:10,180
I'm gonna need you.

667
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:15,252
And you won't be no good to me
when you're in the cemetery.

668
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:19,395
I got to have a couple of days
to get the boys lined up again.

669
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:21,090
While I'm doing that...

670
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:24,101
you'll be where nobody knows
where to find you except me.

671
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:31,541
Come on, give me your guns
and your money. All of it.

672
01:05:32,377 --> 01:05:35,904
- What are you trying to pull, Paddy?
- I'm gonna keep you off the streets.

673
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:39,576
Even you wouldn't be sap enough
to go for a stroll without your gat.

674
01:05:39,651 --> 01:05:41,175
Come on, shower down.

675
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:57,925
All of it.

676
01:06:03,475 --> 01:06:05,909
You got a phone here, Jane?
I'm gonna call Gwen.

677
01:06:05,978 --> 01:06:08,606
No, you keep away from that phone.

678
01:06:09,214 --> 01:06:12,706
I'll call from outside and tell her
I sent you out of town for a few days.

679
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:15,776
- And ring up Mamie, will you?
- Leave it to me.

680
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:18,322
This won't be for long, boys.

681
01:06:19,324 --> 01:06:22,521
I'll have the mob lined up again
in a couple of days.

682
01:06:23,595 --> 01:06:25,358
You'll see that they're comfortable?

683
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:28,263
- You leave that to me, Paddy.
- Okay.

684
01:06:30,902 --> 01:06:34,736
Gather round, boys.
We're going to be a happy, little family.

685
01:06:37,642 --> 01:06:39,576
I hope you got plenty of this medicine.

686
01:07:17,716 --> 01:07:21,083
Yards 6321.

687
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:26,380
Hello.

688
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:28,992
Is Schemer there?

689
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:38,427
Let me make you another drink, Tommy.

690
01:07:40,172 --> 01:07:42,868
You mean to say
you got any of that stuff left?

691
01:07:43,141 --> 01:07:45,166
You haven't drank so much.

692
01:07:48,447 --> 01:07:51,245
I can drink it as long as you can pour it.

693
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:24,408
Only a coal truck.

694
01:08:26,985 --> 01:08:28,885
Had me going for a minute.

695
01:08:28,954 --> 01:08:32,412
- Come on, get in the game, will you, Tom?
- No.

696
01:08:33,992 --> 01:08:35,823
I'm gonna hit the hay.

697
01:09:02,521 --> 01:09:05,183
I thought you'd like a little nightcap.

698
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:11,960
You don't need to feel ashamed
in front of me.

699
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:14,897
Here, let me help you.

700
01:09:18,537 --> 01:09:22,098
- I don't need any help.
- Be a good boy and sit down.

701
01:09:26,645 --> 01:09:29,136
I'll take your shoes off, too.

702
01:09:33,185 --> 01:09:35,619
I want to do things for you, Tommy.

703
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,751
You don't think I'm old, do you?

704
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:50,394
- No.
- You like me, don't you?

705
01:09:51,736 --> 01:09:52,896
Sure.

706
01:10:01,746 --> 01:10:03,236
What's the idea?

707
01:10:04,316 --> 01:10:07,717
Just a goodnight kiss for a fine boy.

708
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:12,916
In your hat.

709
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,768
Get away from me.
You're Paddy Ryan's girl.

710
01:10:35,213 --> 01:10:39,240
- Breakfast is all ready, Tommy.
- I ain't hungry.

711
01:10:40,585 --> 01:10:43,645
Give me some coffee, will you?
And make it black.

712
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,290
You aren't sorry, are you?

713
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,628
- Sorry for what?
- For last night.

714
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,168
What do you mean, for getting drunk?

715
01:10:58,236 --> 01:11:00,966
Aren't you the little playactor?

716
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,504
Wait a minute.

717
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:13,974
Do you mean that...

718
01:11:17,188 --> 01:11:18,883
Why, you...

719
01:11:23,094 --> 01:11:24,789
- Tom, where you going?
- Home.

720
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:26,831
- But Paddy...
- I don't care what Paddy said!

721
01:11:26,898 --> 01:11:29,093
I'm getting out of this dump.

722
01:11:39,277 --> 01:11:41,074
Hey, Tom, wait a minute.

723
01:11:42,247 --> 01:11:45,739
- What happened?
- Nothing. I just got burned up, that's all.

724
01:11:46,251 --> 01:11:48,446
What do you wanna run out on me for?

725
01:11:49,421 --> 01:11:51,412
We're together, ain't we?

726
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:55,023
Sure.

727
01:12:39,003 --> 01:12:40,163
Yes, sir?

728
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:43,337
I was looking at some of the pistols
in the window.

729
01:12:43,408 --> 01:12:45,171
- Shall I show you some?
- Yeah.

730
01:12:45,243 --> 01:12:49,111
- I kind of like that big one.
- That one? All right.

731
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,017
- What do you call that?
- That's a.38 caliber. It's a fine...

732
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:00,421
You got any more like it?

733
01:13:00,492 --> 01:13:03,393
- I've got some smaller ones.
- No, same size.

734
01:13:03,461 --> 01:13:04,450
Sure.

735
01:13:11,569 --> 01:13:14,732
- How do you load that?
- First you break it.

736
01:13:15,507 --> 01:13:17,941
Then you stick the cartridges in the holes.

737
01:13:18,009 --> 01:13:19,670
- Could I see?
- Sure.

738
01:13:23,314 --> 01:13:25,009
- That's right.
- Like that?

739
01:13:29,454 --> 01:13:32,184
- It'll hold six.
- This will be enough.

740
01:13:34,793 --> 01:13:36,226
Stick them up.

741
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:10,684
Okay, Schemer, it's all set.

742
01:15:57,569 --> 01:15:59,196
I ain't so tough.

743
01:16:11,883 --> 01:16:14,443
- Well, Doc, what do you think?
- Can't say.

744
01:16:15,019 --> 01:16:16,680
We'll hope for the best.

745
01:16:21,259 --> 01:16:24,319
Doctor, this is Tom's mother, brother,
and Miss Doyle.

746
01:16:24,395 --> 01:16:26,590
You can go in for a few moments,
Mrs. Powers.

747
01:16:26,664 --> 01:16:27,961
Thank you, sir.

748
01:16:42,614 --> 01:16:43,979
Tommy boy.

749
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,607
Do you know me?

750
01:16:56,594 --> 01:16:57,856
Sure, Ma.

751
01:17:03,568 --> 01:17:05,001
Mike's here.

752
01:17:06,304 --> 01:17:08,101
He's come to see you.

753
01:17:11,576 --> 01:17:14,511
- Hello, Mike.
- How are you, Tom, old scuff?

754
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:20,444
I've been wanting to see you.

755
01:17:21,552 --> 01:17:24,282
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me, Tom.

756
01:17:26,124 --> 01:17:29,651
There's something
I wanted to say to you, Mike.

757
01:17:35,566 --> 01:17:38,194
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

758
01:17:42,473 --> 01:17:44,168
I'm just sorry.

759
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,971
You know.

760
01:17:50,381 --> 01:17:53,441
You and Mike
are going to be friends again?

761
01:17:54,819 --> 01:17:55,979
Sure.

762
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,389
Friends.

763
01:18:01,192 --> 01:18:04,491
Boys, I'm so happy.

764
01:18:05,963 --> 01:18:07,157
So happy.

765
01:18:14,338 --> 01:18:17,239
Ma, you must like Mike
a lot better than me.

766
01:18:17,775 --> 01:18:21,404
No, Tommy boy. You're my baby.

767
01:18:24,682 --> 01:18:25,842
Sure.

768
01:18:30,054 --> 01:18:31,715
I'm your baby.

769
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:36,860
You're coming home, ain't you, Tommy?

770
01:18:37,562 --> 01:18:38,927
To stay?

771
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:41,424
Sure.

772
01:18:43,234 --> 01:18:44,826
Coming home.

773
01:18:48,706 --> 01:18:51,004
I mean, if I can ever get out of here.

774
01:18:51,175 --> 01:18:53,643
You're gonna get out of here, all right.

775
01:18:53,745 --> 01:18:57,806
Why, of course you are.
You're going to get well and strong.

776
01:18:58,716 --> 01:19:00,479
Both my boys back.

777
01:19:01,085 --> 01:19:03,519
All of us together again.

778
01:19:04,989 --> 01:19:08,322
I'm almost glad this happened.

779
01:19:32,817 --> 01:19:35,980
And he really looked better today,
did he, Michael?

780
01:19:36,053 --> 01:19:38,419
Sure, Ma, a lot better. He was sitting up.

781
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:40,650
I told him you'd be in
to see him tomorrow.

782
01:19:40,725 --> 01:19:44,684
- And he'll be coming home soon, won't he?
- Sure, Ma.

783
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,446
Paddy, come in.

784
01:20:09,487 --> 01:20:12,217
What's wrong? Is Tom...

785
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:15,191
They kidnapped him
from the hospital this afternoon.

786
01:20:15,259 --> 01:20:16,988
What? Who did?

787
01:20:17,695 --> 01:20:19,663
Must have been the Burns mob.

788
01:20:21,465 --> 01:20:25,629
First they give it to him in the back,
then they take him when he's helpless.

789
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:28,300
Who knows
what they're doing to him now.

790
01:20:28,372 --> 01:20:31,569
- They ain't gonna get away with this.
- I'm doing all I can.

791
01:20:31,642 --> 01:20:33,940
My boys are out in the street now.

792
01:20:34,812 --> 01:20:37,713
I'll bring Tom back,
if it's the last thing I do.

793
01:20:37,782 --> 01:20:39,807
- I'm gonna...
- You're gonna...

794
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:44,282
stay here at that phone
and take messages.

795
01:20:45,857 --> 01:20:48,655
I told my boys to call you up
if they find anything.

796
01:20:48,726 --> 01:20:50,887
- I'd like to smash...
- Listen...

797
01:20:52,797 --> 01:20:57,700
I sent word to Burns that
if he'd bring Tom back here tonight...

798
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,799
I'd quit the racket.

799
01:21:01,505 --> 01:21:03,097
He could have it all.

800
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:07,100
I'd leave town and I won't come back.

801
01:21:07,478 --> 01:21:10,504
- You think they'll do it?
- It's a sweet offer.

802
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:15,919
You stay here.

803
01:21:16,487 --> 01:21:19,547
If you hear anything
from any one of my boys...

804
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:21,485
call me at my place.

805
01:21:22,994 --> 01:21:25,189
I got to get back on the job.

806
01:21:46,183 --> 01:21:48,117
Don't you like your dinner?

807
01:21:48,786 --> 01:21:51,277
Why, I just ain't hungry, Ma.

808
01:21:57,561 --> 01:21:59,119
I'll get it, Ma.

809
01:22:05,136 --> 01:22:06,501
This is Mike.

810
01:22:07,138 --> 01:22:09,629
When? You are?

811
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:13,375
Fine. Ma, they're bringing Tom home.

812
01:22:13,444 --> 01:22:16,311
- They are? When?
- Right now. He's on his way.

813
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:18,038
- Is he all right?
- He must be.

814
01:22:18,115 --> 01:22:21,209
- They wouldn't be bringing him home.
- It's wonderful.

815
01:22:21,285 --> 01:22:25,153
I'll get his room ready.
I knew my baby would come home.

816
01:22:26,857 --> 01:22:30,122
- Who called?
- One of Paddy's boys. Didn't say who.

817
01:22:30,761 --> 01:22:32,456
- Molly dear?
- Yes, Mother?

818
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:34,930
Bring up some clean sheets
out of the linen closet.

819
01:22:34,999 --> 01:22:36,990
- Hurry, dear.
- All right.

820
01:23:57,948 --> 01:23:58,937
English
