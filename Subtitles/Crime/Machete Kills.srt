184
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:19,462
Thank you.

185
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:21,506
What do I believe?

186
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,550
I believe in the word "equality."

187
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:26,552
I believe in a woman's
right to choose.

188
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:27,678
Choose what?

189
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,597
A snow cone, if that's what
she's in the mood for.

190
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,184
I believe in good barbecue, the
two-step, and the right to carry a gun.

191
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,561
World peace? Sure, why not?

192
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:37,522
But if we really wanna
talk about world peace,

193
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,441
we have to start by tearing down that
wall that separates us from Mexico.

194
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,485
That wall only
enables us to ignore

195
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,570
the violence and injustice
that is occurring down there,

196
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:48,950
thus making world peace nothing more
than a beauty pageant pipe dream.

197
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,619

close to the border

The M4 carbine long-range.

216
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,061
It's got reflex sights, micro-polymer
grip, a customised trigger.

217
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,938
Fast enough to nip a
jackrabbit on roller skates.

218

That is, of course,

219
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,484
you happen to come across a
jackrabbit on roller skates.

220
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:08,613
Or, my personal
favourite, the grappler.

221

scratch those hard to reach places.

224
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,706
I like your style. Low-tech.

is the most sick and twisted

had to keep tabs on.

231
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:40,436
People down south call him
Marcos the Madman.

232
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,355
He used to run with Los Cuerpos

233
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:44,190
until one day he wakes up

234
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,818
and decides he's gonna turn on the
cartel, fight for the people.

235
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,904
We figure he's laired-up
in the jungle somewhere

236
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,906
since our satellites
can't pinpoint him.

237
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,368
Our only lead is this prizewinner,

238
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:58,037

by the name of Cereza.

239

Find her, find Mendez.

240
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,832
- Where can I find her?
- In Acapulco.

241
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,294
Her information, including the address
to her brothel, is in this dossier.

242

243

something from you.

talk about Machete.

246

247
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:21,894
The legend.

248
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:25,481
I just wanna know the
legend inside and out.

249

turn that frown upside down, <i>Papi?</i>

251

MISS SAN ANTONIO:
How long since you've been back?

252
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,030
Since before the wall went up.

253
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,906
A lot has changed since then.

254
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,075
It's a run and gun
free-for-all out there.

255
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,869

256
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,662

right in the middle of it.

you just press pound to phone home.

260
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,506

you think of my Cereza, huh?

It's a shame I had to let her go,

360

here, she betrayed me.

Because our people
don't need songs or stories.

Welcome to VozTech,

880
01:00:45,227 --> 01:00:50,190
the world's premier space technology
and weapons manufacturer.

881
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:53,276
<i>You know, Time Magazine
once called me</i>

882
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,196
a merchant of death
with an assembly line.

883
01:00:56,363 --> 01:00:59,866
But one very special day,
I began to think bigger.

884
01:01:00,367 --> 01:01:05,705
And now I've turned science
fiction into science reality.

885
01:01:06,248 --> 01:01:10,710
(LAUGHS) And this, this is where
we conduct our training exercises.

886
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:13,004
- For what?
- Our exodus.

887
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:14,673
When NASA asked me to build them

888
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:16,925
a new state-of-the-art
luxury spacestation,

889
01:01:17,092 --> 01:01:19,594
I luxuriously told them
to fuck themselves.

890
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:20,330
Why, you ask?

891
01:01:20,356 --> 01:01:22,455
Well, because I'd already
built one of my own.

892
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:25,058
It's up there right now,
just floating the fuck around,

893
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,185
waiting for me and my
people to inhabit it.

894
01:01:27,352 --> 01:01:29,229
- In fact, Mr Cortez...
- Machete.

895
01:01:29,396 --> 01:01:30,856
Incidentally, Mr Machete,

896
01:01:30,939 --> 01:01:33,733
I plan on moving into
my new space pad very, very soon.

897
01:01:33,817 --> 01:01:36,236
I'm very excited.
Here, have a heart.

898
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:37,445
What about the heart?

899
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:39,865
Well, that's why I'm relocating.

900
01:01:40,115 --> 01:01:41,241
Climb aboard.

901
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:44,619
Yes, I'm a Star Wars fan.

902
01:01:45,412 --> 01:01:48,248
Tanks, missiles, bread and butter.

903
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:50,542
It's the simple things that fund

904
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,961
my more out-of-this-world
enterprises.

905
01:01:53,128 --> 01:01:54,880
- Why Mendez?
- Why?

906
01:01:54,963 --> 01:01:57,215
Well, bin Laden is dead

907
01:01:57,299 --> 01:02:00,010
and America
has always needed its boogeyman,

908
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:01,803
so I created a new one.

909
01:02:02,304 --> 01:02:06,975
Yes, I supplied
Señor Mendez with the fireworks.

910
01:02:07,142 --> 01:02:09,936
<i>VOZ: But given Mendez's
aptitude for the unpredictable,</i>

911
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:12,647
<i>I left one of my men
behind to keep me abreast</i>

912
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:14,733
<i>of his process or lack thereof.</i>

913
01:02:14,858 --> 01:02:16,276
<i>MACHETE: What's your plan
have to do with me?</i>

914
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,987
I have high hopes for
you, Mr Machete.

915
01:02:19,154 --> 01:02:21,281
Higher than you could
mentally ascend to.

916
01:02:26,453 --> 01:02:27,787
A spaceship?

917
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:31,291
Technically speaking,
space shuttle.

918
01:02:31,374 --> 01:02:33,001
Not to mention, my legacy.

919
01:02:33,335 --> 01:02:35,462
It all started about six years ago.

920
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:39,424
I privately funded a suborbital launch.
Went up myself.

921
01:02:40,175 --> 01:02:43,011
Yeah, I was something
of a thrillseeker back then.

922
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:45,805
Before what I like to
call "the incident".

923
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:50,810
I was up amongst the stars and
something inexplicable happened to me.

924
01:02:50,977 --> 01:02:52,187
<i>I saw the future.</i>

925
01:02:52,354 --> 01:02:54,022
<i>I saw the world ending.</i>

926
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:57,025
It unfolded right
before my very eyes.

927
01:02:59,486 --> 01:03:01,321
And that's why I built this.

928
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:05,867
Aboard it, me and anyone who wants
to join me will take flight.

929
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:09,245
And when kingdom comes,
as it surely will,

930
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:11,581
we'll be safe amongst the stars.

931
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:14,542
Noah had his ark, I got mine.

932
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:16,753
You really believe that?

933
01:03:17,545 --> 01:03:19,172
I believe what I see.

934
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:23,385
And luckily for you, sir,
I saw you up there with me.

935
01:03:24,344 --> 01:03:26,388
I see glimpses of what lies ahead.

936
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:29,516
It's a condition I was left with
after "the incident".

937
01:03:31,518 --> 01:03:34,312
Speaking of which, I'd take a
step or two back if I were you.

938
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:41,361
You ever had déjá vu?
Lasts a couple of seconds, right?

939
01:03:41,528 --> 01:03:44,531
With me, it's been two years.

940
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:48,034
You don't believe me
now, but you will.

941
01:03:48,368 --> 01:03:51,121
VOZ: Now if I couldn't
see into the future,

942
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:53,581
then how could I
have made all these?

943
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:57,919
Mr Machete, I present to
you the arms of tomorrow.

944
01:03:58,086 --> 01:03:59,379
Pick your fancy.

945
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:10,432
And you pick the only one
in the place that's faulty.

946
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:14,728
I'm sorry, but my molecule
blaster doesn't quite work yet.

947
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:16,896
It keeps turning shit inside-out.

948
01:04:18,106 --> 01:04:20,400
Perhaps this is more
your speed anyway.

949
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:22,610
Primitive, lightweight.

950
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,613

951

Yes.

It's yours.

956
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:41,588
And now, Mr Machete,
if I could just cut to the rub.

957
01:04:42,422 --> 01:04:44,466
I'd like to recruit you.

958
01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:45,884
You already have enough men.

959
01:04:46,051 --> 01:04:47,469
No, but not the best by any means.

960
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:50,930
How can they be when you so
dominantly claim that title yourself?

961
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:52,766

962
01:04:53,308 --> 01:04:54,476

going, I'm going to need an army.

you met in Mexico, Zaror,

he was my prototype-

980
01:06:45,837 --> 01:06:49,424

Special Ed science fair project,

981

You still haven't
told me why I'm here.

983
01:06:54,888 --> 01:06:58,016
I need a stronger specimen from
which to draw a new batch of clones

984
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:00,643
and I was hoping that you
would do me that honour, sir.

985
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:04,063
There is only one Machete.

986
01:07:04,272 --> 01:07:05,773
But what if there were more?

987
01:07:06,399 --> 01:07:09,360
What if there was an army
of enhanced Machetes?

988
01:07:09,444 --> 01:07:11,738

Everywhere Machete!
