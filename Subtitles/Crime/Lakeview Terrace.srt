No, I'm just...
No, I did not give you, my daughter,

1055
00:55:33,695 --> 00:55:35,196
permission to come over here

1056
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:37,132
because it matters to me
what you're learning

1057
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:38,566
and who you're
learning it from.

1058

Okay, I told her
she could come over

and swim whenever
she wanted to.

doesn't matter.

everything you know, right?
