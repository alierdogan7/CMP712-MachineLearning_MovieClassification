among other things,

that you are
a CIA operative,

152
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:08,075
and that you went on
a mission, a fact-finding
mission to Venezuela.

its government
was responsible

your findings and launched
an attack anyway,

retribution for the

166
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,044
My son goes to
school here, too.

167
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:45,245
Yeah, I know.
You said that.

168
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:50,918
You people.

169
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:53,454
You people! My God!
You fucking people!

170
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:57,324
You know, this isn't
about me. Once again,
it's about my husband.

171
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,726
My source is impeccable.

172
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:01,428
Your source is 110%
fucking peccable.

173
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,265
I'm a CIA operative?

174
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,735
I can't even use
the navigation system
in my Prius.

175
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:10,504
This is...
This is absurd!

176
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:14,208
Your paper... Your paper
has been trying to
fuck my husband

177
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:16,176
ever since he spoke out
against this administration.

178
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:17,812
We have your memo.
- What memo?

179
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,681
We have your findings.
- You know. My attorney
is Harry Timmers.

180
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,483
Do you know him?
- Sure.

181
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,752
He's gonna take a lead pipe
to you, and he's gonna
shove it up your ass.

182
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,221
Well, I certainly
don't want that.

183
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:30,891
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Our kids
go to school together, Robin.

184
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,960
Rachel Armstrong.
- Right. Whatever.

185
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,161
Are you denying
you're CIA?

186
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,164
You know what?
You stay away from us.

187
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:38,833
Okay? I mean it.

188
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,540
<i>DAVID: Just say</i>
<i>that the White House doesn't</i>
<i>comment on security issues.</i>

189
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,408
Is that what you're saying?

190
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,111
Come on, David.
Give me something
I can spell.

191
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,712
<i>Off the record,</i>
<i>this is bullshit.</i>

192

193

<i>- You're gonna have</i>
<i>egg on your face.</i>

195
00:08:58,153 --> 00:09:01,455
I gotta go, David.
I got my son
on the other line.

196
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:04,058
Hey, kiddo.

197
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,994
<i>TIMMY: Hi, Mom.</i>
<i>Did you get my paper?</i>

198
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:10,430
Yeah, I'm just getting it now.
Can I read it
and call you back?

199
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:13,034
<i>Okay, but I gotta</i>
<i>go to bed soon.</i>

200
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:15,636
Okay. Well, you can
wait up for me to call you.

201
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:18,572
<i>But Dad said</i>
<i>I had to go to bed.</i>

202
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,741
Well, we'll do it in
the morning. I promise.

203
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,109
<i>Okay.</i>

204
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:24,879
(WHISPERING) It's just, I have
a real big story, honey.

205
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:27,214
<i>It's fine, Mom.</i>

206
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:29,984
Okay, I love you. Bye-bye.

207
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:32,153
Sorry.
- Hey, what's that?

208
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,790
My son had to do a paper
on India. I was just
looking over his outline.

209
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:39,359
I bet you he could give me
10 inches on India's nuclear
buildup with Pakistan.

210
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:41,361
Oh, yeah.
- How'd you do with David?

211
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:44,398
"White House doesn't
comment on security
issues." Blah-blah.

212
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:47,935
Yeah, well, I know you'll
give it more eloquent
phrasing than "blah-blah."

213
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,870
Sure.
- Feels good, huh?

214
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,839
It's worth every
dime I don't make.

215
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:55,309
Look, I want you
to start on a major
profile of Van Doren,

216
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:59,747
from Yale to CIA, to the
marriage to the ambassador
20 years older than her.

217
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,983
He was her professor.
He was married.
A whole drama, I hear.

218
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:05,186
Now, that's
some good stuff.

219
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:08,723
Look, by the way,
you deserve
a good night's sleep.

220
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,926
If I were you, I'd turn the
ringers on my phone off.

221
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,629
(DOOR OPENS)

222
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,801
MERRILL: Hey, Erica.

223
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,838
Why are we meeting
here, Merrill?
- For the chili.

224
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:26,741
No. Why are we meeting
out in the open like this?

225
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:30,111
We're not out in
the open, Erica.
No one knows who you are.

226
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,713
Now tomorrow, when that
goddamn story comes out,

227
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:36,717
tomorrow you'll be
out in the open. Shit!

228
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:39,519
Your husband had to go
and write those articles,
didn't he?

229
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:40,721
Keep him out of this.

230
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:44,324
You're right, Erica.
It's not Oscar's fault.

231
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:47,027
Oscar hasn't been
trained in covert ops.

232
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,029
Oscar didn't take
an oath of secrecy.

233
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:51,431
No, it's your fault.
You shouldn't have
told him anything.

234
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:55,469
Okay, hey, guys.
Here's the SITREP.

235
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:58,906
The paper will be out
in two hours. They haven't
put it up on the Net.

236
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,641
They didn't want to
give the West Coast
papers a chance

237
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,377
to put it in their
morning editions.
And Justice is scrambling.

238
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:06,947
They're bringing in
a special prosecutor to
find out who exposed you.

239
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:08,849
I can't believe this.

240
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:13,487
I mean, our kids go
to school together,

241
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:16,223
you know, the reporter's
kid and mine.

242
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,392
Wait a second.
You know her?

243
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:21,095
Well, I kind of
recognized her today,

244
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,563
but we'd never spoken
before that moment.

245
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:26,533
Let me ask you straight out,
Erica. Was it you?

246
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:29,536
Was it me, what?
- Was it you who leaked
to the <i>Sun Times?</i>

247
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,205
I mean,
it's understandable.

248
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,542
The White House
ignored your report,
and you got pissed.

249
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,378
You goaded Oscar to write
those quote-unquote,
opinion pieces.

250
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:40,347
When that didn't get
traction, you went to
the press yourself.

251
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,849
I went to the press myself.

252
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,584
Someone you knew.
Someone you trusted.

253
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,821
Fuck you.

254
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:49,389
Fuck me? Touche.

255
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,895
The prosecutor,
Patton Dubois,
he'll be in tomorrow.

256
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,563
He'll get Armstrong
before the grand jury.

257
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,565
Law says Armstrong has
to give up her source.

258
00:11:58,633 --> 00:11:59,900
Could it have been Oscar?

259
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:02,502
No. Could it have
been you, O'Hara?

260
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:06,907
How we all doing?
Still doing good?

261
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:08,209
Doing good.
- You sure?

262
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:10,477
Good.
- All right.

263
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:12,112
I'm gonna put you
on the box.
Oscar, too.

264
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,616
Fine. But I want everybody
in the agency who
knows my identity,

265
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:19,220
I want them with
polygraph wires
up their asses, too,

266
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:20,554
because there's
a traitor among us.

267
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,990
We'll find that person
if they're in the CIA.

268
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:26,293
Nonetheless, we should think
about relocating you
for your own good.

269
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:29,196
No. No. I will send Allison
away for a little while,

270
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:33,500
but none of this shit
was my fault. I'm not
gonna be punished.

271
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:35,970
This Lois Lane
and her newspaper,

272
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:38,505
I'm not gonna let her
turn me into
a scared little girl.

273
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:40,241
Uh-uh. I'm staying here.

274
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,443
Whatever.

275
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:47,514
In the meantime,
we'll assign a protective
detail to your home.

276
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:51,485
I feel so much safer.
Thank you.

277
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,422
I can't fucking
believe this.

278
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:36,563
ALLISON: Mommy.

279
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:43,404
Wanna stay home
from school today?
- Yeah.

280
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:52,263
This is very interesting.
It's awesome.

281
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:56,234
Thank you.
- You're welcome. Wow.

282
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,635
I didn't realize they made
so much coffee in India.

283
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:00,905
It also has the most
democrats in the world.

284
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,441
Well, not quite.
India is the biggest
democracy in the world.

285
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:07,211
Isn't that the same thing?
No, it's not the same thing.

286
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,146
Jesus Christ.

287
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,786
Don't give your carrots
to Brandon today. Okay?

288
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,454
Okay, Mom.

289
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,658
You did it.

290
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:24,996
This changes everything.
You're gonna win a Pulitzer.

291
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:26,163
(LAUGHS)

292
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:28,232
I don't know about that.

293
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:36,440
Timmy, come on.
Eat your breakfast.
- I don't like them.

294
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,609
Come on, don't give
Mommy a hard time.
Finish your eggs.

295
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,378
Eggs give you cancer.

296
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,013
Eggs don't give you cancer.

297
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,917
All right, you know what?
I'll finish your cancer,
okay. Okay?

298
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:52,456
Feels pretty good though.
That was a lot of work.

299
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,659
You didn't tell me
half the stuff
that's in here.

300
00:14:55,727 --> 00:15:00,231
Well, you don't tell me
anything that goes into
your novels, so it's fair.

00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,412
Did I have a choice?

327
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,180
Of course you did.

328
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:26,250
I don't have
anything to say,

329
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,488
so if you have a problem,
contact my editors.

330
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:32,056
Can I get you
a cup of coffee?

331
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,724
No, thank you.

332
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,893
Sure, sir, I'm
gonna take some.

333
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,229
Great scoop,
by the way.

334
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:41,765
If this doesn't
make your career,
God knows what will.

335
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,967
Holy moly.

336
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,604
That was something.

337
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,309
Well, I'm gonna be
announced in a few days,

338
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,678
just as soon as all the
paperwork goes through,

339
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:59,917
as the special counsel
to investigate this leak
about Erica Van Doren.

340
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,253
That was fast.

341
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,688
Yeah, I know,
it's kind of unusual,

342
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:09,193
but the boys over at Justice
seem to think this is
a pretty urgent matter,

343
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,262
a not-a-second-to-lose
kind of thing.

344
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,897
So they called me
in last night,

345
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:18,536
and I just checked into
the hotel this morning,
and here we are.

346
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:22,673
The Attorney General's office
has to disqualify itself.

347
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,077
Maybe somebody over there
was your source, eh?

348
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,479
I think I should call
my lawyer.
- That's not necessary.

349
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,982
I'm not gonna be asking
you any questions.

350
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,353
Not here, anyway.
This is neither the
time nor the place.

351
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:39,957
I just wanted to get kind
of an unofficial head start.

352
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:44,128
Can I talk to you
off the record?

353
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,265
Sure.

354
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,735
I mean,
a just-between-you-and-me
kind of thing.

355
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,337

356
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:58,542
Okay, good.
I'll do all the yada-yada.

357
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,314
Now, you were within
your rights to print the
information that you obtained.

358
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,116
However, you're not
within your rights

359
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,720
to protect who it was
that gave Erica up to you,
who exposed her.

360
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:14,825
It's a 1982 law called
the Intelligence Identities
Protection Act.

361
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:16,893
Your source is in
a great deal of trouble.

362
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,862
I've no intention of
discussing my source...
- Hold on.

363
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,365
I'm doing the yada-yada,
remember?

364
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay.

365
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,237
Okay, look,

366
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,939
you're gonna be asked
to appear before
a grand jury.

367
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,008
You're gonna be asked
to identify your source.

368
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,409
I'll be doing the asking.

369
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:36,280
Now, if, for some reason,
you don't reveal your source,

370
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,216
you'll be held in contempt,
and that means jail time,

371
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,453
and we're not talking
about some sort of
a Martha Stewart cell

372
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,522
with a butler, nonsense.

373
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,526
Look.

374
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:52,863
Rachel, go to your source.

375
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,099
Ask him to permit you
to reveal his name.

376
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,670
You may be surprised
at his willingness
to protect you.

377

decent, I have found.

No. But a special prosecutor,
that's no good.

is to find your source,

to divert him.

of unlimited publicity.

Every day.

488
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:58,161
I read his novel about
the Mossad. I read it while
I was on vacation. It was...

489
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,231
It was very entertaining.

490

trying to get out

I'm sorry I lost
my cool with you.

to bring out the
heinous bitch in me.

We had it out,
and he went to go
stay with Allison

send her away, too.

I respect that. Okay?

How's Allison doing?
She hasn't been in school.
Is she sick?

526
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,187
No, no, no.
She is great. She's...

527
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,123
She's just spending
time with a relative.

Okay, great.
I'm batting a thousand.

554

a few days ago, here,

555
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,313

Erica Van Doren,

married to the former
US ambassador,
Oscar Van Doren,

557

And then I want you

all think this is worth

for generations to come.

651
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,656
That's a Theory, right?

652
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:30,990
Yeah.
- It's classy.

653
00:33:31,057 --> 00:33:33,693
Thanks. Nice suit.

654
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:38,364
It's not a suit. It's
a Zegna. Hand stitched,
15 mil mil 15.

655
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:41,668
What's that
you're wearing?

656
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:45,672
I don't know.

657
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:48,140
I'm putting you in
touch with my tailor.

658
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,177
You always know
when you're in a Zegna.

659
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:52,978
Court room three.

660
00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:57,216
Your Honor, this morning,
Miss Armstrong appeared
before the grand jury.

661
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,485
I furnished you
with the transcripts.

662
00:33:59,553 --> 00:34:05,257
And as you know, she was
asked to reveal the name of
the source who provided her,

663
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:09,329
quite possibly illegally,
with secret information
revealing the...

664
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:11,698
Excuse me,
Your Honor. If I may?

665
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:13,132
Yes.

666
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,301
All right?
It's perfectly okay with me.

667
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:17,704
Your Honor,
I just met my client.

668
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:22,408
I ask you to continue this
matter for, say, a week, so
we can get our bearings here.

669
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:24,977
Let me get my bearings first.
Why don't we proceed for now?

670
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:26,612
Well, here's how it is,
Your Honor.

671
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:31,050
Mr. Dubois will say
that my client was asked
to name her source

672
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:34,387
and that she won't
do so, and, thus,
you should compel her.

673
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:38,791
He'll say that the
information that my client
received is highly classified

674
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:43,563
and the GJ is entitled
to know the name of the
source and to find it out.

675
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:48,033
He'll also say that there's
no federal shield law
protecting her

676
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:50,202
and that there's no First
Amendment protection, either,

677
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,306
because this is a matter of,
quote-unquote,
national security.

678
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,208
JUDGE: Is that about right,
Mr. Dubois?

679
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:57,910
In fact, that's it
in a nutshell.

680
00:34:57,978 --> 00:35:02,515
We contend that the
First Amendment does
protect Rachel Armstrong.

681
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:06,318
I'm well aware of cases
in this circuit in which
this contention is...

682
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:09,221
Well, I am aware
of those cases
in this circuit,

683
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:13,926
and they do not authorize
her to refuse to
respond to these questions.

684
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,295
Why don't the three of you
come up here right now?

685
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:18,631
Rachel, Rachel,
come on. Come on up.

686
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,837
ALBERT: Over here
to where the bench is.

687
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:27,139
JUDGE: Miss Armstrong,
I want you to understand

688
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:31,444
that if I should order you
to reveal your source,

689
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:36,516
that if you don't do so,
I'm gonna hold you
in contempt of court

690
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,018
and that you will
be jailed until you...

691
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:40,720
Hold on, Your Honor.

692
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:44,056
Can you rule, please,
on my request for
a continuance?

693
00:35:44,124 --> 00:35:46,559
Right. I'm gonna
deny that motion.

694
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:48,428
I'm only asking for
a few days, Judge.

695
00:35:48,495 --> 00:35:50,329
I understand.
There is a serious
national security...

696
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:52,865
There's no reason
not to grant a continuance.

697
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:55,468
Let me run my courtroom.

698
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:03,275
Now, Miss Armstrong,
I direct you to reveal the
identity of your source.

699
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:07,179
If you want a few
days to consider it,
I'll give it to you.

700
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:09,882
I can't do that.

701
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,319
Mr. Burnside, if you want
a few days to advise
her to obey my order.

702
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:16,522
I can't advise my client
to betray a confidence.

703
00:36:17,257 --> 00:36:18,624
Okay, look, Your Honor,

704
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:21,561
given the direct threat
to our national security,

705
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:25,498
I ask that Miss Armstrong
now be held in
contempt of court

706
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:29,635
and that she be
jailed immediately.

707
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:35,207
JUDGE: Well, it seems to me
that I have before me somebody
who is defying my order

708
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:39,745
and who seems to
believe that she is
above the law itself.

709
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:41,781
I hold you in
contempt of court,

710
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:46,051
and I remand you to
the custody of the
United States Marshal.

711
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,687
Help.
ALBERT: Judge...

712
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:50,556
Wait. No, no. Your Honor.
Judge. Wait... No, wait.

713
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:52,625
Ma'am.
- Your Honor!

714
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:55,060
JUDGE: As soon as you're
prepared to speak,
you will be released.

715
00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:56,696
Could I have a minute
with my client to confer?

716
00:36:56,763 --> 00:36:58,598
You may consult with her
in the detention center.

717
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:01,567
Timmy needs to be
picked up from the
Hobermans' at 5:30.

718
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:03,369
This proceeding is closed.
Judge.

719
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:06,806
Judge. Your Honor!

720
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:10,409
A lot of people looking
to get famous here.

721
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:11,944
So now what?
What do we do now?

722
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:13,546
I'll call you tomorrow.
Don't worry about it.

723
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:15,681
What are you gonna do now?
- I'm gonna call you
in the morning.

724
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:17,917
All right? Okay?

725
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,887
Well, at least you'll
take him off your
Christmas card list. Right?

726
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:22,755
That's right.

727
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,625
It's a scare tactic.
- You think?

728
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:27,426
I'll deal with it.
I'll see you back
at the paper.

729
00:37:27,494 --> 00:37:30,162
Okay, I'll head over there.

730
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,734
Mr. Burnside, this is
a real honor for me.

731
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:37,970
I studied you, growing up.
My dad was also a lawyer.

732
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:41,206
This is a big,
big mistake, Patton.

733
00:37:41,274 --> 00:37:43,175
Well, there's nothing like
learning from our mistakes.

734
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:47,747
Yeah, well, sometimes
a mistake is like wearing
white after Labor Day,

735
00:37:47,814 --> 00:37:51,283
and sometimes,
a mistake is invading
Russia in winter.

736
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:53,419
Hmm.

737
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:27,019
Okay, there are two things
I need to know.

738
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:29,722
First, the story itself.
- Rock solid.

739
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,692
Rock solid. Well,
are we talking talc or
are we talking granite?

740
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:34,694
Albert, please.
We wouldn't have
put it through

741
00:38:34,761 --> 00:38:37,429
if it wasn't...
- Okay. Second,

742
00:38:37,497 --> 00:38:39,031
how many people
know the...

743
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,400
How many people
at the paper know the
names of the sources?

744
00:38:41,468 --> 00:38:44,637
We know the corroborating
source. Well,
Bonnie does, anyway,

745
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:48,507
and one of Rachel's sources
at the FBI gave us a copy
of Van Doren's report.

746
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:50,710
And why don't you have
the name of the
original source?

747
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,879
Well, for one thing,
Rachel agreed to
complete confidentiality,

748
00:38:53,947 --> 00:38:56,882
and because her story
was confirmed, it wasn't
necessary to know.

749
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,351
Well, the good news is,
you can't be
compelled to testify

750
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:01,587
on something
you don't know.

751

753
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:12,064
You can keep that.
- Thank you.

755
00:39:14,768 --> 00:39:17,436
I'm gonna need to
get your jewelry.

00:39:24,477 --> 00:39:26,779
The wedding ring.

757
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:29,048
I'd like to hold on
to those.

758
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,685
It's diamond, baby doll.
You don't want
that in there.

have agreed to submit
to polygraphs.

You know, that's the
only thing that Armstrong's
got going for her

00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:28,507
is the media, getting them
to turn her into some
sort of a cause celeb.

00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:27,927
Well, Olivia James,
this is Rachel...

813
00:42:29,495 --> 00:42:32,131
Rachel Armstrong,
your new bunkie.
Be nice.

814
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:34,300
And show her how
to make the bed.

815
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,001
There you go.

Lights up at 6:00 in
the morning. All right?

817
00:42:38,471 --> 00:42:40,672
Okay. Excuse me.

818
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,309
Is there any way
of seeing a newspaper
in the morning?

819
00:42:43,376 --> 00:42:48,347
No. But if you wanna watch
the news, you have to convince
all of them to do it.

00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:48,807
just give me five minutes
with the prick, okay?

831
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:53,546
Well, it's been my
experience that
Miss Armstrong will tell us.

832
00:43:53,613 --> 00:43:56,748

She'll break.

I don't know. I met her.
I looked her in the eye.

She's a water-walker.

00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:25,944
I wish we had
the cookies, though.

Thank you, sir.

907
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,516
Your Honor, I would ask
that you would
release Ms. Armstrong

908
00:48:24,584 --> 00:48:27,185

the U.S. Court of Appeals

00:48:27,253 --> 00:48:29,488
on the validity of
this contempt citation.

910
00:48:29,556 --> 00:48:31,022
Now that would vitiate
the whole purpose

911
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,159
of her incarceration
in the first place.

912
00:48:34,227 --> 00:48:35,927
She has the key
to her own cell.

913
00:48:35,995 --> 00:48:40,131
A key that comes in the
form of a loss of integrity
is no key at all.

914
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:41,933
Integrity is subjective.

915
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:45,136
Miss Armstrong,
I'm sympathetic, but
you've gotta help me out.

916
00:48:45,204 --> 00:48:47,639
Will you represent to
me that if you're home

917
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:52,010
that you'll pick up the
phone and call or contact
your source

918
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:55,714
and try to get permission
for you to release
the source's name

919
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:58,183
so we can put
an end to all of this?

920
00:48:58,251 --> 00:49:01,119
I would be dishonest
if I said I could do that.

921
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:03,522
Well, then, you're really not
giving me any basis at all.

00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:08,560

Sir, obviously, with
the representation
on display here,

931
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:29,915
obviously, the paper
not only supports,

932
00:49:29,982 --> 00:49:33,385
but is encouraging
Miss Armstrong's position.

933
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:35,387
They're enabling her.

I am. Well, no, I'm not.
I was, but I'm not now,

970
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:51,256
but she was a room
mother there, she said.

971
00:51:51,323 --> 00:51:53,458
You never met at school
functions before that?

972
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:56,094
No.
- Your volunteer work
never overlapped?

973
00:51:56,162 --> 00:51:58,897
You guys never perhaps
talked mom to mom?

974
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:00,465
No. No.

975
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:05,136
Ever go to a school
event where alcohol
was being served?

976
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:07,773
What? What?

977
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,541
You know, when my wife
went to those functions,

978
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:12,578
those
let-your-hair-down
things,

979
00:52:12,645 --> 00:52:17,082
my God, I can't tell you the
things she said that she now
wishes she could take back.

980
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:18,784
Sir, wait.

981
00:52:20,853 --> 00:52:23,789
Are you still
investigating me?

982
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:25,657
Well...
- I just passed a polygraph.

983
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,126
Well, given your training,
I'm not sure how
valuable that is.

984
00:52:28,194 --> 00:52:32,764
It is a clinical
investigation. You don't
need to take it personally.

985
00:52:32,832 --> 00:52:35,067
I don't need to
take it personally?

986
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:38,403
"We think that you're
either incompetent,
a drunk, or a liar,

987
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:41,306
"but you don't need
to take it personally."

988
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:44,743
How dare you?

989
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:46,912
How fucking dare you?

990
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,413
Okay, you need to watch
your tone here, Erica.

991
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:50,148
Let me ask you
a question, sir.

992
00:52:50,216 --> 00:52:53,318
What, in my absolutely
unblemished record,
can you point to and say,

993
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:56,187
"Yeah, yeah,
that's somebody
we can't trust"?

994
00:52:56,255 --> 00:52:57,489
What?

995
00:52:57,556 --> 00:53:01,059
Point is, I don't
even know you.

996
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:02,861
You've been a NOC
for so many years,

997
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,830
there are very few people
who actually know you.

998
00:53:04,897 --> 00:53:07,432
Okay, well, you know what?
I know you. I know you, sir.

999
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,269
I know your type.
I see where this is going.
I smell it.

1000
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:13,005
You know, if somebody
in the CIA messed up,

1001
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:14,873
somebody messed up,
gave me up

1002
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,110
and now you guys are walking
around investigating it
like the Keystone Kops.

1003
00:53:18,177 --> 00:53:21,146
You're just aching
for it to be me. I see it.

1004
00:53:21,213 --> 00:53:24,516
This way you can tell
the press, "You know what?
It's not a rogue agent.

1005

"It is just some silly little
girl whose feelings got hurt

conclusions were ignored

1007
00:53:29,756 --> 00:53:31,256
"by the President
of the United States."

absolved Venezuela

to do with the assassination
attempt on him.

1010
00:53:36,663 --> 00:53:39,064
Now you're being
dramatic, Erica.
- Fine, okay.

1011
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,267
You know what?
You can speak to my
attorney from now on.

1012
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:44,002
You can drop my
protective detail.

1013
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,772
You can stop cutting me
checks. Okay? I quit.

1014
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:48,640
You don't just quit, Erica.

1015
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:52,310
Really? What is this,
<i>The Sopranos?</i> I can't leave
the family? I'm stuck?

1016
00:53:52,378 --> 00:53:55,681
Well, it's a process.
You're full of
privileged information.

1017
00:53:55,748 --> 00:53:59,317
You don't trust me?
Fine, okay.

1018
00:53:59,385 --> 00:54:02,520
I'm gonna give you
reason not to. Okay?

1019
00:54:02,588 --> 00:54:04,956
My husband's not the only one
in the family who can write.

1020
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:08,126
Look, you sure you want
to get in a war with
the government, Erica?

1021
00:54:08,194 --> 00:54:09,761
Do you need the messiness?

1022
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,396
You're in the middle
of a custody battle, right?

1023
00:54:11,463 --> 00:54:16,334
You sure you want to
drag Allison into
the middle of all this?

1024
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:18,603
You are so lucky
you are a woman.

1025
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:19,971
Why is that?

1026
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,507
Because I don't hit girls.

1027
00:54:22,575 --> 00:54:27,645
You know, you weren't
the only agent investigating
the Venezuelans,

1028
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:29,547
but you were the only
one that concluded

1029
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:33,118
that they were not
involved in the attack
on the President.

1030
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:36,321
Yours is not the only report
the President read.

1031
00:54:38,157 --> 00:54:43,028
I wish you the very best
of luck with your daughter
and the custody battle.

1032
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:45,463
I hope you get
to see her again.

1033
00:54:49,335 --> 00:54:50,702

buying my way out of this.

enough money in the world,
I wouldn't be in here

It's jewelry.
Here, look at here.

1129
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:05,260

All right, have fun.

1132

it's gonna be substantive.

- Well, that's what

1138

to be your research assistant.

1139

Great. If not, so be it.

- One minute.

1143

All right. Thank you so much

1144
01:01:48,437 --> 01:01:50,138

1145

1155
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:19,134
Well, physically I feel fine.

that I need, but I feel fine.

1157
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:28,610
You know, I look at you
and I get this sort of,
"How do you do it?" sensation.

How <i>Twilight Zone</i> -ish
is this for you?

1160
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,554
I must say, when I
wake up in the morning,

1161
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,889
it does take me a few seconds
to realize where I am.

1162
01:02:41,957 --> 01:02:45,527
I mean, I haven't grown
accustomed to it.

1163
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:51,999
You're married to the
novelist, Ray Armstrong.

1164
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:53,801
How is the marriage
holding up?

1165
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:57,238
Well, obviously,
it puts pressure...
- It must be very hard.

1166
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:00,308
It is hard.
But we're strong.

1167

You know,
he's very supportive of me,

1168
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,780
and we're best friends.
That really helps.

1169
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:10,185
And what about your son?
Timothy.

1170
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,155
When was the last
time you saw him?

1171
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,841
It's been a long time.

1172
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:20,711
How long?

1173
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,951
He came to see me when
I was first brought here,

1174
01:03:29,154 --> 01:03:32,523
but I have asked that he
not visit me in this place.

1175
01:03:34,493 --> 01:03:36,226
Well, that must be brutal.

1176
01:03:36,295 --> 01:03:40,498
Most mothers, though,
are going to have a
hard time understanding.

1177
01:03:40,565 --> 01:03:43,967
I guess I would have, too,

1178
01:03:44,035 --> 01:03:46,136
but most mothers
would have no idea
what they would do

1179
01:03:46,204 --> 01:03:48,906
unless they were
in my position.

1180
01:03:52,043 --> 01:03:56,013
The truth is, bringing Timmy
here would be selfish.

1181
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,215
You know,
it would be for me.

1182
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:07,591
And I do wonder a lot
if I can survive another
day not seeing him,

1183
01:04:07,659 --> 01:04:10,461
but I know Timmy,

1184
01:04:12,364 --> 01:04:16,567

when he was brought here,

1185

1187

So, you know,
I can't do that to him.

1188
01:04:30,315 --> 01:04:35,285
Rachel, let's get
to the meat of it,
because I have to try.

1189
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:40,991
On your story, on uncovering
the identity of the CIA
agent Erica Van Doren,

1190
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:42,993
who was your source?

1191
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:48,131
Well, Molly, let me ask you.
Why do you have to try?

1192
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:51,435
Try to get a fellow journalist
to betray her integrity?

1193
01:04:51,503 --> 01:04:54,855
I know you know
better than that.
I know you do.

1194
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:58,058
Before the cameras rolled,
you said you were,
quote-unquote, with me.

1195
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,894
Look, I have empathy.
Like you, I would never
give up a source.

1196
01:05:00,962 --> 01:05:03,131
But you know what?
Sometimes sources
have motives.

1197
01:05:03,198 --> 01:05:04,698
Right, okay.

1198
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:07,735
If the information
they're giving is
valuable and truthful,

1199
01:05:07,802 --> 01:05:12,273
like with Watergate or the
Pentagon Papers, then their
motives really don't matter.

1200
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:15,876
Any real journalist would
be prepared to put up
with the discomfort of jail

1201
01:05:15,944 --> 01:05:18,579
to protect their principle.

1202
01:05:18,647 --> 01:05:21,315
I know you say you would
protect your source,

1203

"There but for the
grace of God go I,"

have to worry about

coming after you.
- Why?

1206
01:05:31,226 --> 01:05:33,261
Because the government
really doesn't care

1287
01:12:14,529 --> 01:12:16,764
What? I'm sorry.
I'm not following.

1288
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:19,466
The weather has changed,
Rachel.

1289
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:22,536
I'm sorry, but it has.
That's the truth.

1290
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:27,875
In the old days,
this would have been
a lot easier to fight.

1291
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,777
The public would
have called you a hero.

1292
01:12:29,844 --> 01:12:33,447
But I don't know,
somewhere along the line,
the press...

1293
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:37,384
The press stopped
being the white knight,
and started being the dragon.

1294
01:12:37,452 --> 01:12:39,286
That's the way
people see it.

1295
01:12:39,353 --> 01:12:43,891
You want to know why
no paper in this country,
including your own,

1296
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:46,727
has continued
covering your story?

1297
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:49,529
Why don't you tell me?

1298
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:55,302
Because your 48-hour news
cycle dried up months ago.

1299
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:57,972
I mean, look at you, Rachel.
You look like shit.

1300
01:12:58,039 --> 01:12:59,473
Your kid is growing up
without you...

1301
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:01,274
Don't bring
Timmy into this.

1302
01:13:01,342 --> 01:13:02,676
It's not fair. Okay.
I'm a good mother.

1303
01:13:02,744 --> 01:13:04,578
Fair? Fuck fair!

1304
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,814
Look, you may not want to
bring your son into this,

1305
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:09,149
but I do. You want
to know why?
- Why?

1306
01:13:09,217 --> 01:13:13,120
Because I'm defending
Rachel Armstrong,
not a principle.

1307
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:23,631
A man leaves his family
to go to jail to
protect a principle,

1308
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:26,533
and they name
a holiday after him.

1309
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:29,637
A man leaves his children
to go fight in a war,

1310
01:13:29,704 --> 01:13:32,139
and they erect
a monument to him.

1311
01:13:32,206 --> 01:13:36,744
A woman does the same thing,
and she's the monster.

1312
01:13:36,811 --> 01:13:39,212
If we back down,
what are we saying,
Albert?

1313
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:44,151
"Trust reporters as long as
they're not mothers,
because they'll crack."

1314
01:13:44,218 --> 01:13:48,388
The truth is, if I had
known that writing
this fucking story

1315
01:13:48,456 --> 01:13:52,392
would have separated me
from Timmy, then maybe
I wouldn't have done it.

1316
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:55,529
But here we are.
The story's been published,

1317
01:13:55,596 --> 01:13:59,033
and the path has been chosen,
and there's no way back,

1318
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,569
and in the end,
my son will be fine.

1319
01:14:02,637 --> 01:14:06,339
You know,
Ray is a great father,
and Timmy's gonna be okay,

1320
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,811
but that will not be
the case with my source.

1321
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:15,448
My source will be publicly
saddled with the death
of Erica Van Doren,

1322
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:17,051
and that, I promise you,

1323
01:14:17,118 --> 01:14:18,852
will mean the destruction
of the person
we're talking about,

1324
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,421
and that, Albert,
that is not fair.

1325
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:25,025
AVRIL: Why?

1326
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:30,731
I mean, your source knew
full well the ramifications
of speaking to you.

1327
01:14:33,968 --> 01:14:38,505
My source didn't know
what they were doing

1328
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:40,774
when I got the information.

1329
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:46,046
Was he drunk?
Was he talking in his sleep?

1330
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,948
Hey, take a fucking walk.

1331
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,084
We're trying to swim
a fucking waterfall
here, Albert.

1332
01:14:50,151 --> 01:14:52,519
We have a responsibility
to the shareholders
not to go bankrupt.

1333
01:14:52,587 --> 01:14:55,488
If you're so worried
about that, then I'll go
pro bono from here on in.

1334
01:14:55,556 --> 01:14:58,192
How about that?
- Sold.

1335
01:14:58,259 --> 01:14:59,793
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

1336
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:01,528
Come in.

1337
01:15:01,596 --> 01:15:05,833
Okay. I just got
off the phone.

1338
01:15:07,568 --> 01:15:10,971
Stan Riggens has agreed
to speak to the grand jury.

1339
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,241
I guess signing that
waiver spooked him.

1340
01:15:14,308 --> 01:15:15,408
Stan?

1341
01:15:17,245 --> 01:15:19,079
I owe that kid in
my office 10 bucks.

1342
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,814
When is all this
supposed to happen?

1343
01:15:20,882 --> 01:15:24,551
As soon as possible.
It'll have to wait until
tomorrow morning.

1344
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:27,755
Once he confirms
he was your source,
you're off the hook.

1345
01:15:27,822 --> 01:15:29,890
Pack your bags, Rachel.

1346
01:15:33,494 --> 01:15:36,513
You were chief of staff
to the Vice President.

1347
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:39,183
I resigned
11 months ago.

1348
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,853
And were you the source
of information provided

1349
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:46,924
on the October 6th edition
of the <i>Capital Sun Times</i>

1350
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:51,528
in which the identity
of the covert CIA
agent was revealed?

1351
01:15:52,396 --> 01:15:54,097
STAN: I was.

1352
01:15:54,165 --> 01:15:58,902
Can you tell us all
how that came about?

1353
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:04,507
Well, I guess I was just
so angry at Erica Van Doren
and her husband,

1354
01:16:04,575 --> 01:16:06,376
my emotions got
the better of me.

1355
01:16:06,444 --> 01:16:08,912
I'm not interested
in your motivations.

1356
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:12,615
I want to know how
you came to reveal
this information.

1357
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:15,385
<i>STAN: I was at a party.</i>

1358
01:16:15,453 --> 01:16:16,486
RACHEL: ...you guys,
it's muddy right here.

1359
01:16:16,554 --> 01:16:18,322
<i>I had been drinking.</i>

1360
01:16:23,261 --> 01:16:24,761
Stan.

1361
01:16:26,264 --> 01:16:29,166
Hello there, young-ish lady.
How are you?

1362
01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:33,303
Can I get a beer, please?
Good. Great.
Just here with my son.

1363
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:37,540
They're cute now,
but they grow up.
You know?

1364
01:16:37,608 --> 01:16:39,476
So I've been reading.

1365
01:16:39,543 --> 01:16:42,512
So I heard Glen invited you.
It's good to see you.

1366
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:46,783
Yeah, and you thought,
"Well, how can I pass
up this opportunity?"

1367
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:49,353
That is exactly
what I thought.

1368
01:16:52,957 --> 01:16:55,926
Can I ask you a question?
- Anything.

1369
01:16:55,994 --> 01:16:57,261
Ambassador Van Doren.

1370
01:16:57,328 --> 01:16:59,462
What about him?
- His wife.

1371
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:01,564
Is she a spook, Stan?

1372
01:17:01,632 --> 01:17:03,901
(STAN CHUCKLING)

1373
01:17:05,836 --> 01:17:07,204
Come here.

1374
01:17:11,175 --> 01:17:15,678
Now, look, you did not
hear this from me.
- Of course not.

1375
01:17:15,746 --> 01:17:17,647
Not from me.
- Absolutely not.

1376
01:17:17,715 --> 01:17:21,952
But, everybody knows
she's at the CIA. Everybody.

1377
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:25,022
But you can't use that.

1378
01:17:25,089 --> 01:17:28,425
Hey, I won't say it came
from you, but we're
not off the record.

1379

(SIGHS)

1380
01:17:30,461 --> 01:17:32,129
Screw it.

1381
01:17:32,196 --> 01:17:35,933
Everybody knows anyway.
Common knowledge.

1382
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,735
Do you know if she
happened to get out
to Venezuela at all?

1383
01:17:38,803 --> 01:17:41,071
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1384
01:17:41,139 --> 01:17:46,709
She came to you
and asked you if
Ms. Van Doren was a spy?

1385
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:51,081
She already knew.

1386
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:53,150
That's right.

1387
01:17:53,217 --> 01:17:54,918
ALBERT: They're not satisfied
with Riggens.

1388
01:17:54,986 --> 01:17:57,254
He was just your
corroborative source.

1389
01:17:57,322 --> 01:18:00,857
So was the FBI guy
who gave you her report.

1390
01:18:00,925 --> 01:18:04,561
They still want the original
source, which puts us
back at square one.

1391
01:18:04,628 --> 01:18:07,597
RACHEL: Well, how much
longer can this go on?

1392
01:18:07,665 --> 01:18:11,801
It's seven months or so
before the grand jury
is required to disband,

1393
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:14,338
and then Dubois can just
order up a new one.

1394
01:18:14,405 --> 01:18:15,738
I can't...

1395
01:18:29,487 --> 01:18:32,589
I'm gonna have to tell
the Warden I did this.

1396
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:35,492
Look,

1397
01:18:41,932 --> 01:18:44,067
if you're gonna be here
another seven months,

1398
01:18:44,135 --> 01:18:47,770
then you should know,
in every way

1399
01:18:49,707 --> 01:18:51,708
how this will affect you.

01:20:12,806 --> 01:20:15,775
Well, do I get
any details?

1403
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:20,414
Details? Yeah.

1404
01:20:22,883 --> 01:20:25,485
The details are
you're in here,

1405
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,188
and whatever it is
keeping you in here

1406
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:31,658
is more important to you
than what's on the outside.

1407
01:20:34,995 --> 01:20:36,663
Well, how long have
you been seeing her?

1408
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:38,731
Just a few weeks.

1409
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:42,536
Do you love her?
- I don't know.

1410
01:20:42,603 --> 01:20:44,104
You don't know?

1411
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:47,374
It's only been a few weeks.
You don't know her.

1412
01:20:48,509 --> 01:20:51,211
What do you do
with Timmy?
- What?

1413
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,948
When you're fucking her,
what do you do with Timmy?

1414
01:20:55,015 --> 01:20:58,151
He's with a sitter
when we go out.

1415
01:20:58,219 --> 01:21:00,853
Has he met her?
- No.

1416
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:05,392
Do I know her?
- You don't know her.
I told you that.

1417
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,759
She lives in Maryland...
- Okay. You know what,

1418
01:21:06,827 --> 01:21:09,028
I don't want to
hear any more.
- Look...

impossible for all of us.

I get it. You're lonely.
I'm lonely.

1421

Look, all you have
to do to keep me,

1422
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:23,843
to keep my respect,
is just tell me
it means nothing.

and that...

1424

I'd like to see Timmy now.

Something you should know
is I speak only the best
about you to him.

All right, don't
patronize me. Okay?

1427
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:54,707

They don't allow visitation
on weekends anymore,

is pretty locked in.

of everything else,

1433
01:22:07,388 --> 01:22:08,755
you're gonna try
and keep my son
from me?

No. No, it's not like that.
- Isn't like what, Ray?

01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,347
You're in my bunk.

1449
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,182
Get a new fucking bunk.

1450
01:23:11,919 --> 01:23:14,521
Hey. That's my stuff!
Stop it!
- Yeah. It's going down here!

1451
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:17,691
Hey!
- Get your skanky ass
stuff out of my bunk!

1452
01:23:17,758 --> 01:23:21,094
Go get a new bunk!
- Get your ass out
of my fucking bunk.

1453
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:23,196
This is not your bunk!

1454
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,064
WOMAN: That ain't right.

1455
01:23:25,132 --> 01:23:28,101
You want the bunk?
Your bunk?
You want that bunk? Huh?

1456
01:23:28,168 --> 01:23:29,502
You want that bunk?

(WOMEN SHOUTING)

1458
01:23:39,413 --> 01:23:41,548
You want your fucking
bunk now, huh?

1459
01:23:43,517 --> 01:23:44,784
Yeah.

1460
01:23:55,028 --> 01:23:57,264
WOMAN: Come on,
leave her alone.

(ALARM BLARING)

1462
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:02,736
Get down! Get down!
Get down!

1463
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:14,030
Oh, God.

1464
01:24:17,134 --> 01:24:20,169
What happened?

1465
01:24:20,237 --> 01:24:23,206
I got the shit kicked
out of me, Albert.
That's what happened.

1466
01:24:23,273 --> 01:24:25,074
How? What?
Over what?

1467
01:24:26,276 --> 01:24:30,981
We both wanted the top bunk.
- What?

1468
01:24:31,048 --> 01:24:34,885
Well, you've always
known the important
things to fight for.

1469
01:24:40,558 --> 01:24:42,926
Are the doctors saying
you're gonna be all right?

1470
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:45,028
Yeah. Whatever
that means.

1471
01:24:51,201 --> 01:24:57,874
You know, I'm the most
senior prisoner in this jail.

1472
01:24:57,942 --> 01:25:01,344
I've had 32 different bunk
mates since I've been here.

1473
01:25:02,747 --> 01:25:05,148
I gotta say,
that's a record.

1474
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:12,656
Is that a new tie?

1475
01:25:12,723 --> 01:25:17,460
No, I've had it a while.
Domenico Vacca.

1476
01:25:17,528 --> 01:25:19,829
I took you for
a Kenneth Cole man.

1477
01:25:19,897 --> 01:25:21,364
Kenneth Cole?

1478
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,769
Well, I'm glad you retained
your sense of humor.

1479
01:25:30,174 --> 01:25:33,443
You look like a woman
who could use
some good news.

1480
01:25:35,112 --> 01:25:36,746
It's great news.

1481
01:25:41,285 --> 01:25:43,720
They've agreed.
They're going to
take your case.

1482
01:25:43,788 --> 01:25:46,623
It's gonna be an
expedited hearing.

1483
01:25:52,496 --> 01:25:55,465
<i>JUDGE: The next case this</i>
<i>morning is in re Armstrong.</i>

1484
01:25:55,532 --> 01:25:58,267
We'll hear first
from Mr. Burnside.

1485
01:26:01,038 --> 01:26:04,708
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

1486
01:26:04,775 --> 01:26:08,144
In 1972 in
<i>Branzburg v. Hayes,</i>

1487
01:26:08,212 --> 01:26:12,716
this court ruled
against the right
of reporters

1488
01:26:12,783 --> 01:26:17,053
to withhold the names
of their sources
before a grand jury,

1489
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:21,124
and it gave the power
to the government

1490
01:26:21,191 --> 01:26:24,594
to imprison those
reporters who did.

1491
01:26:24,662 --> 01:26:27,363
It was a five-four
decision. Close.

1492
01:26:29,366 --> 01:26:32,435
In his dissent in Branzburg,
Justice Stewart said,

1493
01:26:32,503 --> 01:26:35,204
"As the years pass,

1494
01:26:35,272 --> 01:26:39,009
"the power of government
becomes more
and more pervasive."

1495
01:26:39,076 --> 01:26:43,179
"Those in power," he said,
"whatever their politics,

1496
01:26:43,247 --> 01:26:45,381
"want only to perpetuate it

1497
01:26:47,151 --> 01:26:49,819
"and the people
are the victims."

1498
01:26:49,887 --> 01:26:55,992
Well, the years have passed,
and that power is pervasive.

1499
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:59,796
Ms. Armstrong could have
buckled to the demands
of the government.

1500
01:26:59,864 --> 01:27:02,498
She could have
abandoned her promise
of confidentiality.

1501
01:27:02,566 --> 01:27:06,235
She could have simply
gone home to her family.

1502
01:27:06,303 --> 01:27:09,205
But to do so

1503
01:27:09,273 --> 01:27:12,241
would mean that no source
would ever speak to her again,

1504
01:27:12,309 --> 01:27:16,112
and no source would ever speak
to her newspaper again,

1505
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:21,551
and then tomorrow when
we lock up journalists
from other newspapers,

1506
01:27:21,618 --> 01:27:24,821
we'll make those publications
irrelevant as well,

1507
01:27:26,891 --> 01:27:31,828
and thus we'll make
the First Amendment
irrelevant.

1508
01:27:31,896 --> 01:27:36,365
And then how will we know
if a president has
covered up crimes?

1509
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:40,503
Or if an army officer
has condoned torture?

1510
01:27:42,472 --> 01:27:48,111
We, as a nation, will no
longer be able to hold
those in power accountable

1511
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:50,513
to those whom
they have power over.

1512
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:55,952
And what then is the
nature of government

1513
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,654
when it has no fear
of accountability?

1514
01:28:00,991 --> 01:28:03,392
We should shudder
at the thought.

1515
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:08,397
Imprisoning journalists?
That's for other countries.

1516
01:28:10,434 --> 01:28:13,569
That's for countries
who fear their citizens,

1517
01:28:15,472 --> 01:28:18,674
not countries that cherish
and protect them.

1518
01:28:21,846 --> 01:28:23,479
Some time ago,

1519
01:28:23,547 --> 01:28:30,353
I began to feel the
personal human pressure
on Rachel Armstrong,

1520
01:28:32,623 --> 01:28:38,527
and I told her that I was
there to represent her
and not a principle.

1521
01:28:44,668 --> 01:28:49,672
And it was not until
I met her that I realized
that with great people,

1522
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:56,345
there's no difference
between principle
and the person.

1523
01:29:11,912 --> 01:29:14,246
Come on. I got
new digs for you.

1524
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:21,120
ALBERT: You know, they
brought him out here...
JUDGE: It's nothing.

1525
01:29:21,188 --> 01:29:22,989
He's not
a real person here.

1526
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:24,791
Soccer isn't
a real thing here.
- They don't respond
to it the same way.

1527
01:29:24,858 --> 01:29:27,927
Judge, good afternoon.
- It's just not.

1528
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:30,663
Good afternoon,
thanks for coming over.

1529
01:29:30,731 --> 01:29:33,265
Mr. Burnside.

1530
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:36,703
We're talking about
soccer not law.
Just want you to know.

1531
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:39,672
Look, the reason I asked
the two of you to come
over here today

1532
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:43,542
is that the Supremes
have decided your case.

1533
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:45,712
The ruling will be
down on Monday,

1534
01:29:45,779 --> 01:29:50,249
but I've been told by
a confidential source
what it is,

1535
01:29:50,317 --> 01:29:53,152
and I wanted to
share it with you.

1536
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:56,656
Five-four, opinion
against you, Albert.

1537
01:29:56,724 --> 01:30:01,094
Same as before.
National security,
First Amendment,

1538
01:30:01,161 --> 01:30:04,697
the court went with
national security.

1539
01:30:04,765 --> 01:30:08,300
And I want to say to you,
Patton, congratulations.
You did a great job.

1540
01:30:08,368 --> 01:30:10,336
The court once again

1541
01:30:10,403 --> 01:30:15,474
has made clear that in
a case where journalists
are not cooperative,

1542
01:30:15,542 --> 01:30:17,510
they may have
to be incarcerated.

1543
01:30:17,577 --> 01:30:19,345
Well, thank you, sir.

1544
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,515
That having been said,

1545
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:25,852
I've decided to let her go.

1546
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,825
I'm sorry, sir. What?

1547
01:30:32,893 --> 01:30:36,763
I've gotta let her go.
I've been doing this
a lot of years now,

1548
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:42,135
and I am sure that
this woman is not going
to reveal her source.

1549
01:30:42,202 --> 01:30:44,904
She's been locked up
for almost a year.

1550
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:47,640
She has been beaten
within an inch of her life.

1551
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:52,045
She is resolute.
- That's exactly right.
Exactly right.

1552
01:30:52,112 --> 01:30:56,683
I can only keep her in jail
if I think doing so will get
her to reveal her source.

1553
01:30:56,750 --> 01:31:00,953
She's not going to talk.
I really have no choice
but to let her go.

1554
01:31:01,021 --> 01:31:02,955
If I may. This is a...

1555
01:31:03,023 --> 01:31:06,693
This is a woman
who's been protecting
a criminal.

1556
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,294
That makes her a criminal.

1557
01:31:08,361 --> 01:31:11,630
Oh, come on.
She's not a criminal,

1558
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:13,199
and she won't be a criminal

1559
01:31:13,266 --> 01:31:18,071
unless she is duly charged
and duly convicted by a jury,

1560
01:31:18,138 --> 01:31:20,840
and that's not my call.

1561
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,641
When are you gonna
sign the paperwork,
Your Honor?

1562
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,210
I want to get her out
of there right away.

1563
01:31:24,277 --> 01:31:25,511
I'm gonna go to court
Monday morning.

1564
01:31:25,579 --> 01:31:29,148
I'm gonna announce
that I'm freeing her.

1565
01:31:29,216 --> 01:31:31,383
And, Patton,
you got a choice. You can
beat me to the punch.

1566
01:31:31,451 --> 01:31:33,753
Just dissolve the grand jury.

1567
01:31:36,056 --> 01:31:39,092
PATTON: As I'm sure your
attorney has informed you,

1568
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:41,194
the grand jury has
been disbanded.

1569
01:31:41,261 --> 01:31:43,262
We're gonna have to
wait till midnight
to let you go.

1570
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:45,231
ALBERT: Midnight?

1571
01:31:45,298 --> 01:31:49,435
What? You're keeping
the reporters away
from your losing cause?

1572
01:31:49,502 --> 01:31:51,971
Rachel,
I know almost all of it.

1573
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:57,977
I am indicting two
government officials
for talking to you.

1574
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:01,781
I wish I knew who it was
that first tipped you off,

1575
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:04,183
but I'm not gonna
get greedy.

1576
01:32:07,687 --> 01:32:09,889
I'm losing custody
of my kid.

1577
01:32:12,926 --> 01:32:15,161
You want the
wedding ring?

1578
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:16,863
Kind of a trophy.

1579
01:32:19,099 --> 01:32:22,235
You know, vilify me
if you want, Rachel,

1580
01:32:22,302 --> 01:32:24,771
but I had a job to do,

1581
01:32:24,838 --> 01:32:27,606
and I had every right
to do what I did.

1582
01:32:27,674 --> 01:32:31,744
I think you're confusing
your rights with your
power, Mr. Dubois.

1583
01:32:45,292 --> 01:32:46,659
It's okay.

1584
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:53,266
We booked you a room
at the Mayflower,

1585
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:56,635
but you know you're
welcome to stay with me
as long as you need.

1586
01:32:56,703 --> 01:32:58,938
Thank you. Thanks.

1587
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:00,006
Sure.

1588
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:03,009
I spoke to Ray.

1589
01:33:03,076 --> 01:33:05,144
He's gonna bring Timmy by
first thing in the morning.

1590
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:08,080
Thought maybe
you would like to
take him to school?

1591
01:33:08,148 --> 01:33:09,415
Yeah.

1592
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:14,620
That's okay?
- Yeah.

1593
01:33:15,555 --> 01:33:17,356
That'd be amazing.

1594
01:33:17,424 --> 01:33:19,625
God, I'm gonna scare
him to death, though.

1595
01:33:22,896 --> 01:33:27,666
And, well, you let me
know what you want to
do in terms of work.

1596
01:33:27,734 --> 01:33:29,401
You can if you want to.

1597
01:33:29,469 --> 01:33:32,371
No one's going to pressure
you about writing
about your experiences.

1598
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,541
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

1599
01:33:35,608 --> 01:33:36,909
Oh, please.

1600
01:33:36,977 --> 01:33:38,477
Rachel, look in the glove,

1601
01:33:38,545 --> 01:33:41,480
hand me the insurance
and registration, would you?

1602
01:33:41,548 --> 01:33:43,682
I was only going 30.

1603
01:33:55,528 --> 01:33:57,330
Ma'am, would you please
step outside of the car?

1604
01:33:57,397 --> 01:33:59,866
What's going on?
- We just need you to step out.

1605
01:33:59,933 --> 01:34:02,501
Not you, ma'am.

1606
01:34:02,569 --> 01:34:04,470
Are you kidding me?
- Get out of the car, Rachel.

1607
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:07,173
What's the problem, sir?
- I can't believe this.

1608
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,341
What do you want?
- I'm gonna ask you to
turn around, please.

1609
01:34:09,409 --> 01:34:13,646
What is it?
What are you doing?
- Hey, hey! Go easy on her.

1610
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:15,581
Rachel, I'm sorry
that it's come to this.

1611
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:17,483
What is going on?
- Back in the car, ma'am.

1612
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,018
Rachel, you're
being charged with...

1613
01:34:19,086 --> 01:34:20,787
BONNIE: What's going on here?
They're arresting me, Bonnie.

1614
01:34:20,854 --> 01:34:22,621
You're being charged
with criminal contempt
of court.

1615
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,390
What does that mean?

1616
01:34:24,457 --> 01:34:28,460
Well, it means you have
obstructed justice,
and you're going on trial.

1617
01:34:28,528 --> 01:34:31,898
Come on. Let's go.
- Hasn't she been
through enough?

1618
01:34:34,267 --> 01:34:36,268
God damn it.

1619
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,843
Oh, no. God.

1620
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:46,278
BONNIE: Dubois! Dubois!

1621
01:34:48,548 --> 01:34:51,417
PATTON: Rachel, you're
looking at a possible
five-year sentence

1622
01:34:51,484 --> 01:34:54,187
for impeding
a federal investigation,

1623
01:34:54,254 --> 01:34:56,823
but I don't wanna
go to trial.

1624
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:59,859
So, I want to give you
a chance to plead
this sentence down.

1625
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:05,431
I want you to look
in my eyes and gauge
my sincerity.

1626
01:35:05,498 --> 01:35:10,136
Use your reporter's instincts.
Okay? You're good with those.

1627
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:14,073
I'm gonna offer
you two years.
- No. No.

1628
01:35:14,141 --> 01:35:18,644
No, it's gonna be suspended
sentence, probation.

1629
01:35:18,712 --> 01:35:20,579
You have to respect
what she's been through.

1630
01:35:20,647 --> 01:35:24,817
Albert, two years is
not as good an offer
as it could be,

1631
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,620
but it's not as bad,
either.

1632
01:35:27,687 --> 01:35:31,457
Because you're guilty,
Miss Armstrong.
You're guilty as charged,

1633
01:35:31,524 --> 01:35:37,263
and if you want to waltz
into a courtroom
in a martyr's cloak,

1634
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:41,067
trust me, you're gonna
see something that
you have not seen yet.

1635
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:44,804
Because this polite,
country lawyer demeanor

1636
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:48,407
is gonna give way
to a wave of
self-righteous indignation

1637
01:35:48,475 --> 01:35:51,110
that you can't even
begin to imagine.

1638
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:53,913
That jury is gonna hear
fire-breathing oratory

1639
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:57,683
about a country
whose security has
been compromised,

1640
01:35:57,751 --> 01:36:02,255
a husband widowed,
and a little girl who's gotta
visit her mother's grave

1641
01:36:02,322 --> 01:36:05,524
because you wanted to
chase a Pulitzer Prize.

1642
01:36:08,428 --> 01:36:11,164
So, if you force me
to take you to trial,

1643
01:36:12,465 --> 01:36:14,133
I'm gonna make sure
that you don't make it home

1644
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:15,935
for your son's high
school graduation.

1645
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:18,204
ALBERT:
Come on, that's enough.

1646
01:36:19,773 --> 01:36:22,275
So, what's
it gonna be, Rachel?

1647
01:36:27,647 --> 01:36:30,783
If I agree to this,
there is one thing I need.

1648
01:36:33,586 --> 01:36:34,921
Oh, my God. You have
gotten so handsome.

1649
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:38,390
You're a real little man.

1650
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:40,626
I'll bet you got
all the girls chasing
after you, huh?

1651
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:42,461
No.

1652
01:36:42,529 --> 01:36:44,563
No? Well, you will.

1653
01:36:44,631 --> 01:36:47,533
I don't care. Whatever.

1654
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,303
Hey, I kind of like
your hair this way.

1655
01:36:52,873 --> 01:36:54,573
Look, I know
you're mad at me.

1656
01:36:54,641 --> 01:36:56,775
No, I'm not.

1657
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:59,611
Well, I think you are,

1658
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:02,148
and I haven't let you
see me in a long time.

1659
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:04,283
I'd be mad at me, too.
- Well, I'm not. Okay?

1660
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:06,385
Okay.

1661
01:37:06,453 --> 01:37:08,888
Look, kiddo,
it hasn't been easy
for me, either.

1662
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:10,389
If I'd known it was
gonna go on this long,

1663
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:11,858
I would have done
things differently.

1664
01:37:11,925 --> 01:37:14,626
I would have let you see
me every single day.

1665
01:37:17,697 --> 01:37:19,365
I am so sorry.

1666
01:37:21,368 --> 01:37:23,569
Dad says you could have
got out of here many times.

1667
01:37:23,636 --> 01:37:25,604
Well, your dad is wrong.

1668
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:32,378
Look, kiddo...
- I'm not a kid anymore.

1669
01:37:32,445 --> 01:37:35,181
Okay, you know what?
You can pretend not to
love me all you want,

1670
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:37,750
and I can pretend
to believe it,

1671
01:37:39,552 --> 01:37:41,287
but I love you,

1672
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:45,124
and I think about you
every minute of every day.

1673
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:46,959
Okay?

1674
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:50,462
Dad says you're
going to prison.

1675
01:37:50,530 --> 01:37:53,665
I am.
- Isn't that where
you are now?

1676
01:37:53,733 --> 01:37:55,534
No. This is jail.

1677
01:37:55,602 --> 01:37:57,303
Jail is where you go
when they decide
your punishment,

1678
01:37:57,371 --> 01:38:00,006
and then you go to prison.

1679
01:38:00,073 --> 01:38:02,208
And what's
your punishment?

1680
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:04,410
Two years.

1681
01:38:04,477 --> 01:38:06,379
That's a long time.

1682
01:38:06,446 --> 01:38:10,016
Yeah. But if I'm
well-behaved, then
I might get out earlier.

1683
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:12,484
So...

1684
01:38:12,552 --> 01:38:15,154
Is it dangerous there?

1685
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:19,292
You know what?
If you visit me,
come check on me,

1686
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:21,360
I'll be okay.

1687
01:38:24,764 --> 01:38:28,134
Okay. I'm kind of busy,
but I'll try.

1688
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,306
I think we should go now,
on account of traffic and all.

1689
01:38:33,373 --> 01:38:36,809
Hey, hey, how about
a kiss? Just one.

1690
01:39:02,302 --> 01:39:03,369
TIMMY: Bye.

1691
01:39:59,192 --> 01:40:00,893
<i>TIMMY:</i>
<i>You're a tattletale!</i>

1692
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,362
<i>ALLISON: I am not!</i>
<i>You just told on Nicky.</i>

1693
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:05,697
<i>That's because</i>
<i>he won't stop.</i>

1694
01:40:05,765 --> 01:40:08,867
<i>You're a tattletale.</i>
<i>RACHEL: Timmy,</i>
<i>that's enough. Stop it.</i>

1695
01:40:08,935 --> 01:40:11,070
That's enough.
- But you're not
supposed to tattle.

1696
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:14,773
Well, you're not supposed
to have to put up
with bullies, either.

1697
01:40:15,942 --> 01:40:17,743
Come on. Come on.

1698
01:40:19,812 --> 01:40:22,014
Are you a writer
or something?

1699
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:25,651
Yeah, I'm a reporter.
I work for the
<i>Capital Sun Times.</i>

1700
01:40:25,718 --> 01:40:27,353
We get that newspaper.

1701
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:29,188
Oh, yeah? Well,
tell all your friends
to do the same.

1702
01:40:29,256 --> 01:40:33,559
The Internet is killing us.
- Mom, how long
till we get there?

1703
01:40:33,626 --> 01:40:35,561
About 18 hours, Timmy.

1704
01:40:35,628 --> 01:40:37,863
No, Mom, really.

1705
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:40,132
I don't know.
I don't know.

1706
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,471
My daddy is a writer.

1707
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,441
He is? What does he write?
- He writes articles,

1708
01:40:48,508 --> 01:40:51,544
though my mom doesn't
really like what
he writes about.

1709
01:40:51,611 --> 01:40:54,947
What's he write about?
- He writes about
the President.

1710
01:40:55,949 --> 01:40:57,349
What's your last name?

1711
01:40:57,417 --> 01:40:58,917
Van Doren.

1712
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,821
Why doesn't your mommy
like what he writes about?

1713
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:04,823
I heard her yelling
at Daddy once.

1714
01:41:04,891 --> 01:41:08,294
'Cause he used her
secret stuff,
she found out.

1715
01:41:08,361 --> 01:41:12,231
What she found out?
- When she was in Venezula.

1716
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:16,368
Why was your mom
in Venezuela?
Was she on vacation?

1717
01:41:16,436 --> 01:41:19,171
Uh-uh, she was working.

1718
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:23,409
Working?
- Uh-huh.
For the government.

1719
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:27,012
But don't tell anybody
it's me who told you. Okay?

1720
01:41:29,916 --> 01:41:31,317
You bet.

1721
01:41:56,626 --> 01:41:59,228
