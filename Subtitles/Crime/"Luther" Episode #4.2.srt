1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,796
- Alice Morgan.
- Has something happened?

3
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:08,000
I didn't put her down...
or have her put down.

4
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:13,761
Why did you steal the phone I
used to call Alice Morgan?

5
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:15,235
What did he do with the heart?

6
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:16,435
He ate it.

7
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:20,741
Animal like that...

8
00:00:21,572 --> 00:00:23,447
he's always moving forward.

9
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:27,391
All their computers were fixed
by one man, Steven Rose.

10
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,598
That's him.

11
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:32,085
Benny! Stop this...

12
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:36,264
Steven.

13
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:39,124
- Can we salvage anything from this.
- Too soon to tell, boss.

14
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:49,808
Sorry, Guv. She's asked
for you by name.

15
00:00:56,288 --> 00:00:58,247
Can I help?

16
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:00,008
Are you DCI Luther?

17
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,007
Yeah.

18
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:05,448
I have a message for you.

19
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,607
A message from who?

20
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:11,167
Alice Morgan.

21
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:23,047
What kind of message?

22
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:25,968
She said to tell John
that Stacey has the owl.

23
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:35,967
When did she give you this message?

24
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:37,887
Last night.

25
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:40,895
See, that's not true, is it?
Because Alice is dead.

26
00:01:40,943 --> 00:01:42,006
I know.

27
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:45,807
I'm sorry, who are you?

28
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:47,488
Look, I'm just here to help.

29
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:52,338
- And how do you know Alice?
- I don't.

31
00:01:57,338 --> 00:01:59,698
- And did she say anything else?
- Not really.

32
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:04,378
There was one thing.

33
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:09,698
Something I don't really
understand, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:12,698
Something like what?

35
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:16,818
"Meep meep."

36
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:24,817
Put this woman in the car and cuff her.

37
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:27,137
Down there, thank you.

38
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:28,817
What's all this?

39
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:31,474
Er, don't ask. What's going on?

40
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:33,170
We've got another one.

41
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,618
How much of the brain did he eat?

42
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:49,177
Roberta Wise.

43
00:03:49,178 --> 00:03:52,657
She's a Professor of Economics,
University of London.

44
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:56,218
- A government adviser and...
- And then this.

45
00:03:57,818 --> 00:03:59,897
Look at her life.

46
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:01,817
Look at what he took from her.

47
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:04,457
This wasn't murder, this was theft.

48
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,657
Come again?

49
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:10,137
I think he's this clever, little
lonely man, slowly falling apart,

50
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:13,297
spending his days watching
the lives of others.

52
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:17,257
other people's lives seem
so much better than ours.

53
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,858
More interesting, more
attractive, more alive.

54
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:25,097
The way he sees it, they got
something that he needs

55
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,458
so, he's just going
to take it from them.

56
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,777
No, he's never going to stop,

57
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:33,817
he's just going to keep
doing it and doing it,

58
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:36,218
because he'll never get
back whatever he's lost.

59
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:39,178
None of us ever do.

60
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:56,657
Don't stop, love. Drive on.

61
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:58,417
I can't. Look at him.

62
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:01,218
Then let's call the police.
They'll deal with it.

63
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,698
What if it was Declan?

64
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:11,617
- You all right, mate?
- You all right, love? What's happened?

65
00:05:11,618 --> 00:05:13,297
What have you done to yourself?

66
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:16,217
I'm so sorry... thank you
for stopping, I'm so sorry.

67
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:17,577
I'm so sorry.

68
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:20,377
No, no.

69
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:08,567
- sync and corrections by Caio -

70
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,337
- DCI Luther.
- Back on the beat, Pete?

71
00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:26,297
Well, needs must, innit?

72
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:28,337
Thanks for the hospitality.

73
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:32,297
No, George... I just had to figure out
who killed Alice Morgan. All right?

74
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,617
I'm sorry it ended up
the way it did but...

75
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:38,897
I'll put it right. To tell you the
truth, I am tempted to let it lie.

76
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,857
I mean, you are obviously
a decent chap.

77
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,897
But you did what you did
in front of my son.

78
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:46,457
If I start showing weakness to him...
well, it's nature's way, isn't it?

79
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,017
The Lion King. Hakuna Matata.

80
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:51,817
Er, I think you're thinking
about the wrong song.

81
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:54,417
What one am I thinking of, then?

82
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:59,737
Oh, "Hakuna Matata", that's the happy
one, right? "No more worries."

83
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:01,857
That one. That's the one.

84
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,378
Then, I'm definitely
thinking of the wrong song.

85
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,417
I've put a price on your head, John.

87
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:11,617
Out of interest, how much
do you think you're worth?

88
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:15,217
Well, probably not enough for a
good night out and a cab ride home.

89
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,817
Well, I'm honestly down
in the dumps about it.

90
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:20,017
But you did bring it down on yourself.

91
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:23,697
So, you're a dead man walking.

92
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:25,658
Toodle pip.

93
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,177
Hey.

94
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:24,697
We've got Steven Rose leaving
the building at 21:32pm.

95
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:28,657
We follow him down here, down
here and then... well, he's gone.

96
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:31,777
Off camera. Yeah. How many
bodies we got looking for him?

98
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:37,017
- Aerial units. Ground units. Dog units.
- Good.

99
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:41,217
They won't find him.
But, er, keep looking.

100
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:43,617
"Cut the chatter, Red 2.

101
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:45,297
Accelerate to attack speed."

102
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:47,978
What? What was that?

103
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:51,658
Sorry. Erm...

104
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:57,417
Theo and me... DCI Bloom...

105
00:08:57,418 --> 00:09:00,058
He quite liked the odd
Star Wars reference.

106
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:03,098
"Not this ship, sister."

107
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:09,978
Do you know any David Bowie?

108
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:18,497
Erm... Yeah, I liked
him in, in that film.

109
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:21,777
The one in the maze. With the baby.

110
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,498
And the puppets...

111
00:09:25,258 --> 00:09:27,897
We Are The Dead.

112
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,697
I'm sorry?

113
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:33,897
Well, there's this thing.
Cotard's Syndrome.

114
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:36,817
OK. It's a delusional mental illness

115
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:41,257
and the patient thinks that
he's dead and decomposing.

116
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:44,657
And the cannibalism? That's a symptom?

117
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:46,617
No, not usually.

118
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:49,257
I mean, I'm making a...

119
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:53,937
a leap. Well, it's a small leap...
it's more of a hop, really.

120
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:56,658
So, how do we get ahead of him?

121
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:02,057
See, I think he's like
a feral dog right now

122
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:04,177
trying to find a place to hide.

123
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:07,937
I think we lean into that. I think
we go public, put his name and face

124
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:10,457
to the media, force him into one place.

125
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,777
Keep him still and then...

126
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,257
figure out what he does next.

127
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:18,297
And you think he's rational
enough for us to be able do that?

128
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,737
He's delusional, but not deranged.

130
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,898
to get what he needs just
to keep going, you know?

131
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:33,537
- How you doing, Ben?
- Like an anxiety dream.

132
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:36,337
I have to keep checking I'm
still wearing trousers.

133
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:39,137
Well, we can't move without knowing
what's on them hard drives.

134
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,938
- Guv, you got a minute?
- Sure.

135
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:59,257
Jonathan Black, March, 1999, is
lured into a park, suffocated.

137
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:08,857
Next day, Brian Elder
drowns himself in a canal.

138
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:12,218
Jonathan Black's underpants
in his pocket. Slam dunk.

139
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:17,338
Is she in the file?

140
00:11:19,498 --> 00:11:22,817
No, she's not. But I am.

141
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:25,777
See, I didn't think Brian
Elder killed himself, right?

143
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,498
I actually think this girl did it.

144
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:32,577
Stacey Bell.

145
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:34,577
Back then, no one was
paying attention to me,

146
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,777
I was still wet behind the
ears, but I was right.

147
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:39,217
When she was 17, she got
done for manslaughter.

148
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:42,657
She pushed her nan down the
stairs and let her die.

149
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:45,337
She just got out two
and a half months ago.

150
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:49,768
You know there's nothing to it?
This psychic drivel, right?

151
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,577
She knows something about Alice Morgan.

152
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:10,697
So, you're a partner in
a Corporate PR Firm?

153
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,618
Yes. That's right.

154
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:16,297
So, what are you doing here?

155
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:20,738
You're educated, financially
stable, I just don't get it.

156
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:26,697
- I'm not sure what you're implying.
- Well, clairvoyants are...

157
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:28,978
confidence tricksters, aren't they?

158
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:32,714
Grave robbers preying on
the lonely and bereaved.

159
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,137
That's not what I do.

160
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:36,258
- No?
- No.

161
00:12:37,418 --> 00:12:41,937
I don't broadcast this,
let alone profit from it.

163
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:49,377
Why?

165
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:57,337
I don't to be here doing this.
I don't want to be...

167
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,898
I don't want this to be happening.

168
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:10,418
I woke up in the middle of the
night and she was standing there.

169
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:16,098
"Tell John that Stacey
Bell has the owl."

170
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:19,378
- Who's Stacey?
- I don't know.

171
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:23,738
- What owl are we talking about?
- I'm not sure.

172
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:30,858
Thing is, it does actually make sense.

173
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:42,337
Jonathan Black had a
favourite toy and, er,

174
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:44,458
it disappeared when he disappeared.

175
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,697
Of course, all of that
was kept from the press.

176
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:51,378
I mean, no one actually...
no one knew that.

177
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:54,498
So, how do you know it?

178
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:03,177
She's here.

179
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:05,098
She's standing behind you.

180
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:07,897
Who?

181
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:10,618
Her mouth is moving, but
I can't hear her words.

182
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:17,857
- I can make out what she's saying, though.
- Yeah?

183
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,658
What is she saying?

184
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:24,618
Tell John, "Hell is real."

185
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,817
I can find a connection
if there's one there,

186
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:51,057
but John, I don't think there is.

187
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,018
That poor wee lad died years ago.

188
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:58,617
Alice died a couple of days ago in Antwerp.
There's no connection.

189
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:02,137
So, because you can't believe
it's true, logically it's false.

190
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:05,537
Is that really an argument now? Ey?

191
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:10,017
Benny, listen to me, I told
Alice Morgan about this,

192
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:12,817
I told her about Jonathan
Black, Stacey Bell.

194
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:18,097
how I couldn't put it right.

195
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:19,737
What did she say?

196
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:22,458
"Let's find Stacey Bell
and set her on fire."

197
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,657
But that's not the point.

198
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,097
I don't know what, I don't
know what the point is.

200
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:37,137
The only way that Megan could know
that is if Alice Morgan told her.

201
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:38,818
That's it.

202
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:44,017
Now... she knows something.

203
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:47,898
She knows something, I don't know
what it is, but I just need to know.

205
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:05,618
- You getting anywhere?
- Somewhere.

206
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:11,458
- You all right, there?
- He killed Theo, Benny.

207
00:16:12,698 --> 00:16:15,097
I want to find him.

208
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:17,578
I want to rip HIS heart out and eat it.

209
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,378
So, hurry up.

210
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:26,457
DS Lane? Boss?

211
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,977
I need you to go to Steven
Rose's place of work.

212
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:32,657
I want you to speak to his boss, his
colleagues, friends, lovers, whoever.

214
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:40,097
What's this, busywork?
Keep me out of your hair?

215
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:41,617
Nope.

216
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,098
Chop, chop.

218
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:00,058
You awake?

219
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:03,297
No, no.

220
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:06,058
No, everything's fine, it's fine.
I just, er...

221
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:11,257
Well, I'm just calling because
I don't want you to worry!

222
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:13,778
Look, I'm going to be
home the minute I can.

224
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:19,298
I promise.

225
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:23,018
I love you, too.

226
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:26,057
Sleep.

227
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,978
Sleep.

228
00:18:14,498 --> 00:18:16,737
Leave a message after the beep.

229
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:20,257
Mum? It's Declan. I just got your text.
Is everything all right?

230
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,738
You all right? Yeah.

231
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:36,657
Actually, I... I dunno. It's
a bit weird, it's me mum.

232
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,417
Do you mind if I nip off for a bit?

233
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,658
- Nah. You go home, mate.
- Cheers, Mohan.

235
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:50,857
So, how've you been?

236
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:54,738
I remember you. Constable Luther.

237
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,217
You were very kind.

238
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:01,937
You seemed to care about my brother.

239
00:20:01,938 --> 00:20:04,217
Well, thank you.

240
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:06,817
I did.

241
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:11,057
I don't want to upset you, or worry
you, but when someone approaches us

242
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:14,137
with fresh information, we're
obliged to review the case.

243
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:15,817
So, that's what this is?

244
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:17,178
Fresh information?

245
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:22,737
During the investigation we, erm...
withheld information.

246
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,457
- George Owly.
- Yeah, but...

247
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,937
have you been talking
to someone about that?

248
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:32,177
- Not that I can think of.
- Not any pushy journalist,

249
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:34,497
or anyone saying that
they're a psychic?

250
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:36,697
- No?
- No? Why?

251
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:38,738
No, it's just, erm...

252
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:46,258
Sorry, can I just look at that?

253
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,898
Do you remember this girl here?

255
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,538
Stacey Bell.

256
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:18,897
Everyone's favourite worst nightmare.

257
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:20,858
She made Jonathan's life hell.

258
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:24,538
Wicked little cow.

260
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:32,457
Erm, why d'you say that?

261
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,737
Cos you know they moved
her back here, yeah?

262
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:38,297
What, back here on the estate?

263
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,858
I saw her down the shop.

264
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:44,777
She asked me how I was doing.

265
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,578
I said it was fine.

266
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:52,217
She said it was a shame
about my brother.

267
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:54,338
And then she laughed.

268
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,377
- No...
- Are you OK?

269
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:09,138
It's OK.

270
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,377
Stacey, is it?

271
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,297
It's not, no.

272
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:22,777
You sure? Because you don't half
remind me of someone I knew.

273
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:25,017
- Who? Your mum?
- Nah.

274
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:27,297
No, this little girl I
knew a long way back.

275
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:30,497
- I often wonder what happened to her.
- Why's that, then?

276
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:34,377
You like to think about her when you're
having a little play with yourself?

277
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:38,897
See, that's exactly the sort of thing
she would say, if she was here.

278
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:41,938
- Except she's not here, is she?
- Apparently not.

279
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:35,937
I'm sorry, we can't get
to the phone right now,

280
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:38,657
so please leave a
message after the beep.

281
00:25:40,658 --> 00:25:43,017
Mum, it's Declan. I
shouldn't be too long,

282
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:47,018
I'm just stuck in a bit of traffic,
all right. I'll see you soon. Bye.

283
00:27:47,818 --> 00:27:49,977
- Wotcher.
- George?

284
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:53,497
All right, John. You
still with us, then?

285
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:57,137
Er, just about. One of your
boys just had a pop at me.

286
00:27:57,138 --> 00:28:00,097
Well, obviously I don't know what
you're talking about, officer.

287
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:01,937
But if I did, I'd probably say,

288
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:04,617
"They wouldn't be my
boys, specifically."

289
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:07,617
See, if you've been
greenlit, allegedly,

290
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:10,937
every would be hit man in
London would be after you.

291
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:13,377
- How was he, by the way?
- Rubbish.

292
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:14,897
Whoopsie daisy.

293
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:17,697
- So, how can I help?
- George, just lay off.

294
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:20,737
I've got a nutjob running
around London eating people

295
00:28:20,738 --> 00:28:23,737
- and I've got a dead kid.
- What do you mean, "Dead kid"?

296
00:28:23,738 --> 00:28:25,537
Yeah. Now, you and me,
we're old school, right?

298
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:30,577
What's this, Billy Bacon and the
soft-centered Cockney Villain?

299
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:35,617
Thing is, George, I think this dead
kid is connected to our thing.

300
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:38,137
- Alice Morgan.
- How?

301
00:28:38,138 --> 00:28:41,177
Like I said, I'm not sure.
But I know it's connected.

302
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,737
- What are we now, psychic?
- Yeah, funny you should say that.

304
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:51,377
you are asking for what?
A stay of execution?

305
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:53,857
They broke the mould after
you popped out, didn't they?

306
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,977
Yeah. That's what my mum used to say.

307
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,017
Your sainted mother.

308
00:28:58,018 --> 00:29:01,152
Is this another appeal to
my maudlin East End heart?

309
00:29:01,178 --> 00:29:02,218
No. Whatever.

310
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:05,137
Well, I hated my mother, John.

311
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:07,577
And greenlit is greenlit, I'm afraid.

312
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:10,897
It's out of my hands.

313
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:13,337
I'll see you on the
other side of the veil.

314
00:29:48,378 --> 00:29:50,818
Mum? Dad?

315
00:30:38,658 --> 00:30:41,138
Mum? Dad?

316
00:30:57,378 --> 00:30:59,458
Mum?

317
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:40,898
Was it there?

318
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:49,098
You ever hear of the...

319
00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:52,018
... confirmation bias?

320
00:31:54,138 --> 00:31:56,738
- I beg your pardon?
- We all do it.

321
00:31:58,218 --> 00:32:02,138
You sort of see things in a way that
support what you already believe.

322
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:06,097
So, you, erm...

323
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,937
we form an opinion and
then you create a theory

324
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:11,777
- and then you work hard to prove it.
- I don't follow.

325
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:13,738
Yeah. Well, see...

326
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:17,017
... here's me thinking,

327
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,057
"She must really know a
lot about Alice Morgan.

328
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:22,937
I mean, she must know Alice Morgan!"

329
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:24,537
You know?

330
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:27,058
"How else would she
know all those details?

331
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,137
Jonathan Black.

332
00:32:30,138 --> 00:32:32,017
The toy owl.

333
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:34,577
Stacey Bell."

334
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,817
Right? But then the thing is...

335
00:32:37,818 --> 00:32:42,658
No, you don't know Alice Morgan. You
don't know Alice Morgan, at all.

336
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:47,778
It's Jonathan you know, isn't it?

337
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:52,418
Jonathan Black and Stacey Bell.

338
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:57,977
You know them because you
were in their class.

339
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,777
Now, which one's you?

340
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,538
Which one's Sarah Roberts?

341
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,418
So, you do remember.

342
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:12,218
To be fair, you've changed a lot.

343
00:33:14,698 --> 00:33:16,978
Do you remember the
promise you made me?

344
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:21,297
She said that she would
kill me if I told anyone.

345
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:25,817
And I did tell someone. Because
you said that I could trust you.

346
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:27,618
- I know.
- You promised.

347
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:31,057
- You did nothing.
- That's not true.

348
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:33,577
I was ten years old! Too
petrified to sleep.

349
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,867
Do you know what happens to
someone, when they don't sleep?

350
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:36,970
- To their mind?
- Yeah.

351
00:33:37,072 --> 00:33:38,127
- You do?
- Yeah.

352
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:39,213
Good.

353
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:42,697
Because it was your fault.

354
00:33:42,698 --> 00:33:44,258
You lied.

355
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:48,657
So, that's it?

356
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:51,697
All this woo-woo bullshit,
that's it? That's it?

357
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:55,337
This is way of putting all of that
right, because you're petrified -

358
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:57,738
still petrified of Stacey Bell.

359
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:02,778
Do you know what it's
like to be haunted?

360
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:08,177
Megan, that is just your guilt talking, OK.
The dead are gone.

361
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:13,097
No. The dead aren't even dead, John.

362
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,057
I'm arresting you.

363
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:19,337
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
perverting the course of justice.

364
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:22,138
- No, you're not.
- Sorry?

365
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,898
You can't arrest me for anything.

366
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:33,497
No? And why's that, then?

367
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:35,698
Because I know what you were planning.

368
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:40,058
- You and Alice Morgan.
- What's that supposed to mean?

369
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:44,458
Conspiring to sell uncut diamonds.

370
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:47,738
Running away with a wanted killer.

371
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:52,098
What would happen to you, I
wonder, if I were to tell?

372
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:57,577
Megan, did you break into my house?
Did you take something from me?

373
00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:59,858
- Like what?
- A phone.

374
00:35:01,698 --> 00:35:04,657
How long have you been
listening to me and Alice?

375
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:06,257
Long enough.

376
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:08,578
Long enough to know
what happened to her?

377
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:18,577
Was Alice talking to someone
that I didn't know about?

378
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:21,338
Someone that, someone
that could hurt her?

379
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:25,338
Megan... I need to know.

380
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:29,177
Of course you need to know.

381
00:35:29,178 --> 00:35:31,217
It would be inhuman not to.

382
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:34,618
I make good on my promise, I make
good on my promise to you...

383
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:38,898
... then you help me out. All right?

384
00:35:41,618 --> 00:35:44,258
One step at a time, John.

385
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:02,178
I need to go.

386
00:36:08,378 --> 00:36:10,978
Boss! We're in!

387
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,138
This is some guy, huh?

388
00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:33,337
Right, what we got?

389
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:37,937
Steven Rose has been keeping
tabs on over two hundred people.

390
00:36:37,938 --> 00:36:39,377
We've been in contact with as many

391
00:36:39,378 --> 00:36:41,217
as possible and advised
them accordingly.

392
00:36:41,218 --> 00:36:43,497
Anything we can use
to get ahead of him?

393
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:47,497
No contingency plans as such, but
there is a data list of bolt holes,

394
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:50,377
places all over London
he could hide out in.

395
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:53,017
Abandoned homes,
schools, swimming pools.

396
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:55,618
The problem is, that there are
hundreds of them, spread over

397
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,339
six hundred square miles
of Greater London.

398
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,938
- DS Lane, what did you get?
- He lives alone,

399
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:03,537
has done for about
seven or eight years.

400
00:37:03,538 --> 00:37:07,337
A few girlfriends, nothing serious.
Not since a girl called Katherine.

401
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:08,318
Katherine who?

402
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:11,257
Meadows. She and Steven
were students together.

403
00:37:11,258 --> 00:37:14,177
Prototypical first love
thing, back when summers

404
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:15,777
were endless and whatnot.

405
00:37:15,778 --> 00:37:19,057
She's long since married,
she's now Katherine Woodward.

406
00:37:19,058 --> 00:37:24,297
Other than that, no flatmates,
no hobbies, no real friends...

407
00:37:24,298 --> 00:37:28,457
No life. This, erm, Katherine,
she's definitely not on the list?

408
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,337
Not listed, sir. There is
no Katherines on the list.

409
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:34,577
- Kates, Katies?
- Nope, she's not there.

410
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:36,750
Well, we need to talk to her.
Has she got an address?

411
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:37,766
Er, yeah.

412
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:45,057
Police warn that Steven Rose
should be considered dangerous.

413
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:48,897
Members of the public
should not approach him,

414
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:50,682
but should immediately
contact the police.

415
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:53,137
Police are also appealing for

416
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,977
anybody who might have information...

417
00:37:55,304 --> 00:37:58,668
- Owen, get the door.
- Who died and made you God?

418
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:01,617
Sorry, I can't. I'm too
busy having a life.

419
00:38:01,618 --> 00:38:04,852
- Can you get your arse off the sofa?!
- Door!

420
00:38:06,898 --> 00:38:10,377
These are live pictures coming
to us now of the urgent manhunt

421
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:13,778
that is ongoing across the
capital for Steven Rose.

422
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:18,497
We will be updating you as
we get the information.

423
00:38:22,018 --> 00:38:24,778
Katie, did you call this lot?

424
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:29,977
Steven?

425
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:32,097
And I would like to
repeat, police have warned

426
00:38:32,098 --> 00:38:34,697
Steven Rose should be
considered extremely dangerous.

427
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:33,537
The Woodward's are gone, he's got 'em.

428
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,137
Benny, I need you to go through
that list of bolt holes.

429
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:38,537
Isolate a two-mile
radius from this point.

430
00:39:38,538 --> 00:39:41,978
On its way, boss. Red lights are
properties on the database.

431
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:10,738
If he wanted to kill her...

432
00:40:13,258 --> 00:40:15,377
... he would have just killed her here.

433
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:20,018
The fact that he's taken her away,
that tells me that he needs time.

434
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:22,578
To do what?

435
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:27,097
I think the thing of it is that he's
come back to get what he's lost.

436
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:29,377
And the husband? The step-kids?
How does that fit?

437
00:40:29,378 --> 00:40:34,017
Katie loves them. All right?
And that's what Steven does.

438
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:36,298
He takes from others
what he hasn't got.

439
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:42,497
What is your knowledge of
crime to journey stats?

440
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:47,217
Er, stats say that the less familiar
an offender is with a given area,

441
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:48,987
the closer to home he'll
commit his crimes.

442
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:51,697
Which puts Steven within
a mile and a half of us.

443
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:53,697
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:58,217
That's Benny. I told him to send
you a list of those bolt holes.

445
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:01,177
OK. So... so, what? We
isolate the properties

446
00:41:01,178 --> 00:41:03,377
- that fall inside that radius?
- No.

447
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,260
Looking for what? Vacant
houses for let or sale?

448
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:07,377
No, too risky.

449
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:10,418
- We know he needs time, right?
- Renovations?

450
00:41:12,058 --> 00:41:14,858
No, it's the same problem, isn't it?
Erm...

451
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:19,498
Boss, there's the old Onslow Hospital.

452
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:23,217
Yeah, OK.

453
00:41:23,218 --> 00:41:25,657
Erm, OK. So, what do we do?

454
00:41:25,658 --> 00:41:27,897
Well, we should call in armed response.

455
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:29,498
Yeah. We... we should do that.

456
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:33,379
Except last time we did
that he got away...

457
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:37,257
So, what do we do?

458
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:39,618
- We do it right.
- Good answer.

459
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:29,098
Please, don't.

460
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:35,017
Please.

461
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:01,177
Steven. Please, don't.

462
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:02,817
I want you back.

463
00:44:05,258 --> 00:44:08,498
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

464
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:36,418
Hey, wait.

465
00:45:22,498 --> 00:45:24,338
Emma?

466
00:45:32,698 --> 00:45:34,857
Run!

467
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:23,258
Are you Owen Woodward?

468
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:24,818
Are you hurt?

469
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:28,497
Where is he?

470
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:30,257
Who else is he with?

471
00:46:30,258 --> 00:46:32,417
My family.

472
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:35,217
OK. OK. You need to get out.

473
00:46:35,218 --> 00:46:37,817
OK. It's going to be OK.

474
00:46:37,818 --> 00:46:39,938
Quietly. It's going to be OK.

475
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:01,297
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Steven!
Stop! Stop! Just stop!

476
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:02,977
Just stop!

477
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:05,978
Stop. Stop.

478
00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:11,177
You lost her, mate. OK? She's gone.

479
00:48:11,178 --> 00:48:15,257
She's gone. All right? But this
thing that you're feeling,

480
00:48:15,258 --> 00:48:18,457
this thing, it's in your head,
it's a physical thing, you know.

481
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:21,137
It can be put right.

482
00:48:21,138 --> 00:48:25,458
- I died.
- No, no. The dead don't come back, OK?

483
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:30,458
Now, we think they do, but they don't.

484
00:48:35,978 --> 00:48:37,417
Steven!

485
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:39,258
Don't! Stop! Stop!

486
00:48:56,898 --> 00:48:59,138
Emma...

487
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,657
Emma.

488
00:49:02,658 --> 00:49:05,138
Put it down. Put it down.

489
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,858
We got to talk about that gun.

490
00:49:43,538 --> 00:49:46,978
- Yeah, I should have told you I took it.
- Yeah, you should have.

491
00:49:53,298 --> 00:49:55,298
You found it, all right?

492
00:49:56,498 --> 00:49:58,658
It was Steven's gun and you found it.

493
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,978
It'll be all right.

494
00:50:06,978 --> 00:50:09,138
It was a good shooting.

495
00:50:29,418 --> 00:50:30,897
Hey, Ben.

496
00:50:30,898 --> 00:50:33,377
Good work, Dirty Harriet.

497
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:35,497
Boss, can I have a word?

498
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:37,498
Yeah.

499
00:50:39,738 --> 00:50:41,817
It's about that other thing.

500
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:44,577
I've been having a nosey around

501
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:47,737
Megan Cantor's financials.

502
00:50:47,738 --> 00:50:50,697
Now, there's nothing massively
out of the ordinary,

503
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:52,857
but there is something,
it might be nothing.

504
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:56,898
- Not everything's something.
- She does pay rental on a safe deposit box.

505
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:22,978
Nice hat.

506
00:52:24,538 --> 00:52:27,138
Nice coat. Very sensible.

507
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,618
- We find ourselves in a pickle.
- We are. We're in a pickle.

508
00:52:36,658 --> 00:52:38,418
What if I found a way to fix it?

509
00:52:39,418 --> 00:52:43,057
For you to save some face
and make some money?

510
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:45,137
Quite a bit of money.

511
00:52:45,138 --> 00:52:47,177
Well, as it happens, I often find

512
00:52:47,178 --> 00:52:50,618
that money has an elevating
effect on my frame of mind.

513
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:56,497
There. That's what you wanted.

514
00:52:56,498 --> 00:52:58,605
That's what you tried
to steal from Alice.

515
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:02,137
Well, it seems a bit unseemly
when you put it like that...

516
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:04,097
but, yeah, that's the gist of it.

517
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,617
Where'd you find them, by the way?

518
00:53:05,618 --> 00:53:07,937
Inside the body, were they?
What, she swallow them?

519
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:09,457
Do you want them, or what?

520
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:13,577
Are we being serious, now? You
do know what this lot is worth?

521
00:53:13,578 --> 00:53:15,657
Yeah.

522
00:53:15,658 --> 00:53:17,658
Enough to start a new life.

523
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:21,457
But that's not going
to happen now, is it?

524
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,458
What am I going to buy with these?

525
00:53:39,218 --> 00:53:41,217
Shame she died.

526
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,978
You ever find out who did it?

527
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:46,338
Look, you've got your money now.

528
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:50,257
What are the chances of
you me doing a favour?

529
00:53:50,258 --> 00:53:52,898
Here we go, then. What do you want?

530
00:53:54,138 --> 00:53:58,697
Cocaine, heroin, pills...
whatever's lying about.

531
00:53:58,698 --> 00:54:02,138
Well, that's an unusual request.
I mean, given the day job.

532
00:54:04,018 --> 00:54:06,658
It's been an unusual
couple of days, George.

533
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:11,938
Yeah.

534
00:54:53,538 --> 00:54:57,617
And where did you come
across this information?

535
00:54:57,618 --> 00:55:00,137
A tip.

536
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:02,377
From...?

537
00:55:02,378 --> 00:55:05,017
A source.

538
00:55:05,018 --> 00:55:07,098
A source.

539
00:55:08,258 --> 00:55:10,657
And this puts it to bed?

540
00:55:10,658 --> 00:55:12,537
For good?

541
00:55:12,538 --> 00:55:14,258
Yeah.

542
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:17,938
Will there be anything else?

543
00:55:18,978 --> 00:55:21,498
No, boss. Thank you.

544
00:55:30,938 --> 00:55:32,858
Get off of me!

545
00:55:35,058 --> 00:55:37,218
Ow!

546
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:46,377
They'll do her for intent to supply
and then they'll upgrade to murder

547
00:55:46,378 --> 00:55:48,577
when they connect the toy to Jonathan.

548
00:55:56,138 --> 00:55:58,218
Do you feel better putting it right?

549
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,057
Did you hurt her?

550
00:56:03,058 --> 00:56:04,658
Who?

551
00:56:06,938 --> 00:56:08,378
Alice.

552
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:11,018
Did you?

553
00:56:12,538 --> 00:56:14,377
Why would I?

554
00:56:14,378 --> 00:56:17,737
Because you wanted me
to keep my promise.

555
00:56:17,738 --> 00:56:20,017
You had to stop me from leaving.

556
00:56:20,018 --> 00:56:21,697
Hmm.

557
00:56:21,698 --> 00:56:24,138
It could be that.

558
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:30,457
Or perhaps it could be
that Alice Morgan...

559
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:33,537
was your blind spot.

560
00:56:33,538 --> 00:56:36,658
You didn't love her, not really.

561
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:41,538
She frightened you and
she excited you...

562
00:56:42,738 --> 00:56:44,658
... and you mistook that for love.

563
00:56:48,818 --> 00:56:51,897
But you would have
killed her, eventually.

564
00:56:51,898 --> 00:56:53,618
If she didn't kill you first.

565
00:56:56,618 --> 00:56:58,778
Perhaps that's why I did it.

566
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:10,817
But I didn't.

567
00:57:10,818 --> 00:57:13,617
Megan...

568
00:57:13,618 --> 00:57:15,578
... are you scared of me?

569
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,818
Clearly not.

570
00:57:22,298 --> 00:57:24,577
Well, you should be.

571
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:26,298
Because I'm coming for you.
