42
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,197
My name is Yuri Orlov.

43
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,278
When I was a boy,
my family came to America.

44
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,311
But not all the way.

45
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,557
Like most Ukrainians,
we congregated in Brighton Beach.

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,910
It reminded us of the Black Sea.

47
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,112
I soon realised we'd just
swapped one hell for another.

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,189
Even in hell, an angel
sometimes makes an appearance.

49
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,915
I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine
since I was ten years old.

50
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,998
Of course, she didn't know I existed.

51
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,078
I was startin' to think
she had a point.

52
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,075
For the first 20-odd years of my life,

53
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,875
Little Odessa was to me
what it is to the Q train:

54
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,911

55
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,439
Oh, I did lie about my name.
It's not really Yuri Orlov.

56
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,200
There've been few occasions
in the 20th century

57
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,233
when it's been an advantage
to be a Jew, but in the '70s,

58
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,989
to escape the Soviet Union,
our family pretended to be Jewish.

59
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,760

has been kosher ever since.

That's Vitaly, my younger brother.

62
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,995

he just didn't know it yet.

than most Jews,

66
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,396

from the Soviet Union,

78

my destiny lay in fulfilling
another basic human need.

90

I went to temple with my father.

Of course, that would eliminate
your opportunity for repeat business.

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,515
Those Exocet missiles in the Falklands.

170
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,598
He was selling guns
before there was gunpowder.

171
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,074
I'll be right back.

172
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,157
Mr Weisz? Mr Weisz?

173
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,715
It's OK, they're talking.

174
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,911
- May I help?
- Yes. A mutual friend,

175
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,749
Eli Kurtzman, from Brighton Beach,
said to contact you.

176
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,350
I have a business proposal.
Perhaps we could discuss it.

177
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,314
I don't think you and l
are in the same business. [laughs]

178
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,636
You think I just sell guns, don't you?

179
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,319
I don't. I take sides.

180
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,910
But in the lran/lraq war,
you sold guns to both sides.

181
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,671
Did you ever consider
that I wanted both sides to lose?

182
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,555
Bullets change governments
far surer than votes.

183
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,320
You're in the wrong place,
my young friend.

184
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,476
This is no place for amateurs.

185
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,515
[Russian]

186
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,633
Curious how you revert to your native
tongue in moments of extreme anger.

187
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,432
And ecstasy.

188
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,471
[man and woman groaning]

189
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,152
[Russian]

190
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,711
[laughter, groaning]

191
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,234
[Vitaly] Oh, you are beautiful.
What's your name again?

192
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,670
[television in German]

193
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,793
The only option for Vitaly and me
was under-the-counter gunrunning.

194
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,277
I got my first break in Lebanon,
after the suicide bombing.

195
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,399
But I wasn't the only
local kid making good.

196
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,676
[distant gunfire]

197
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,030
When the United States
leaves a war zone,

198
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,913
they generally don't take
their munitions.

199
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,430
It costs more to bring it back
than to buy new stock.

200
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,232
[Yuri] So.

201
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,793
We sell by the kilo.

202
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,958
They're second-hand weapons,
but they're still OK.

203
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,400
- How many kilos would you like?
- 5,000.

204
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,397
I had a flair for languages,

205
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,875
but I soon discovered
that what talks best

206
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,198
is dollars, dinars, drachmas, roubles,
rupees and pounds fuckin' sterling.

207
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,073
Of course, the US Army
got a piece of the action.

208
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,431
Army salaries were no better
in the '80s than they are today.

209
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,438
Some of the brass,
like Lieutenant Colonel Southern,

210
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,234
needed to raise money
for their own private wars.

211
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,271
Good to make your acquaintance.

212
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,598
This is bullshit money, Vit.
This is small fucking potatoes.

213
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,997
- What, you wanna go more legit?
- No, more illegal.

214
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,556
What I would give right now
for a plate of cabbage and potatoes.

215
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,234
[gunfire]

216
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,911
It's not our fight.

217
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,872
Vit, come on.

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,558
Let's go. Come on.

219
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,789
Selling guns
is like selling vacuum cleaners:

220
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
you make calls,
pound the pavement, take orders.

221
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,149
I was an equal-opportunity
merchant of death.

222
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,749
I supplied every army
but the Salvation Army.

223
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,197
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.

224
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,597
/# Flying Lizards:
Money (That's What I Want)]

225
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,955
I sold communist-made bullets
to fascists.

226
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,799
[Asian language]

227
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,631
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when
they were fighting my fellow Soviets.

228
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,751
I never sold to Osama bin Laden

229
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,272
Not on any moral grounds. Back then,
he was always bouncing cheques.

230
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,878
[gunfire]

231
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,754
By the mid-'80s,
my weapons were represented

232
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,952
in eight of the world's
top ten war zones.

233
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,278
[ringing of cash register]

234
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,270
There's no problem
leading a double life.

235
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,278
It's the triple and quadruple lives
that'll get you.

236
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,268
Back then I carried a French, British,
Israeli and Ukrainian passport,

237
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,756
and a student visa for the US,
but that's another story.

238
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,839
I also packed six different briefcases
depending on who I was that day

239
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,190
and the region of the world
I was visiting.

240
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,672
Without operations like mine,

241
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,192
it would be impossible for certain
countries to conduct a respectable war.

242
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,359
I was able to navigate around those
inconvenient little arms embargoes.

243
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,676
There are three
basic types of arms deal:

244
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,189
white, being legal;
black, being illegal;

245
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,119
and my personal
favourite colour, grey.

246
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,629
Sometimes I made
the deal so convoluted

247
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,593
it was hard for me to work out
if they were on the level.

248
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,394
To fool authorities,
I often spoke in code.

249
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,637
Rocket-launchers were "mothers",
rockets "children",

250
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,116
the AK-47 assault rifle
was the "Angel King".

251
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,356
It's Yuri. [laughs]

252
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,120
Yeah. Well, yeah, Raoul.

253
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,438
Raoul, the Angel King
will arrive tomorrow. [laughs]

254
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,596
Hallelujah to you too. All right.

255
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,315
The point is, if I've done my job right,
an arms embargo should be

256
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,432
- practically impossible to enforce.
- [telephone]

257
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,153
What?

258
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,113
OK, just slow the fuck down.

259
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,550
I can't understand you. What?

260
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,558
What do you mean, "tipped off'?
They know where we are?

261
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,832
Where are they?
Well, how long have I got?

262
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,634
"Not long"?
What does that mean? Shit.

263
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,831
- Do we try to lose them?
- On this?

264
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,952
- Yuri, we have to get off.
- No one's going anywhere.

265
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,037
Slow. Dead slow. Buy me time.

266
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,992
[bell rings]

267
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,351
Yeah, it's Yuri.
Get that fuckin' rag down!

268
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,189
I need another handle for this tub.
Something in our weight class.

269
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,710
You! Over the side.
We're changing the name. Now!

270
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,998
Yes, it's gotta check out!

271
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,794
The way I look at it,
what's in a name?

272
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,274
You got a shorter name?

273
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,278
I'd often changed the registration
of a ship or plane,

274
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,948
but never at such short notice.

275
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,149
Damn. They're hauling.

276
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,990
What? "Kono"? How do you spell that?
K-O-N-O. OK, well, that's good.

277
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,873
"Kono". K-O-N-O.

278
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,471
What do we fly? Dutch? Got it.
Vit, get me a Dutch flag, will you?

279
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,559
- Faster, or I'll send your arse in!
- Yuri, I don't have Dutch!

280
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,273
- What?
- I've got Belgium.

281
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,792
What use is that? He's painting a name
registered in the fucking Netherlands.

282
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,197
- I've got a French flag.
- So?

283
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,631
Turn it sideways, it's Dutch.

284
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,718
[Yuri laughs]
That's why you're my brother.

285
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,119
[Yuri] Good.
Everybody look innocent now.

286
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,519
They say every man has his price,
but not every man gets it.

287
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,439
Interpol agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought,

288
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,392
at least not with money.

289
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,160
For Jack, glory was the prize.

290
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,590
Yeah, it's the Kono,
it's not the Kristol.

291
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,756
Kono, K-O-N-O.

292
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,080
- [man] It's clean,sir.
- Clean? It sure doesn't look clean.

293
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,429
I'm gonna go aboard.

294
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,996
Phone in a sighting
of the Kristol south of Aruba.

295
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,640
Even when I was up
against an overzealous agent,

296
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,071
I had a number of methods
for discouraging a search.

297
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,795
I routinely mislabelled
my arms shipments "farm machinery",

298
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,434
and I've yet to meet
the customs official

299
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,757
who will open a container
marked "radioactive waste"

300
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,916
to verify its contents.

301
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,669
But my favourite is the unique
combination of week-old potatoes

302
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,075
and tropical heat.

303
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,720
It smells.

304
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,349
Sir, a sighting of the Kristol,
due north.

305
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,633
Most importantly, I kept a number
of intelligence people on the payroll

306
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,991
to supply their colleagues
with counter-intelligence.

307
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,553
Let's go.

308
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,436
The second rule of gunrunning is,

309
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,518
always ensure you have
a foolproof way to get paid,

310
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,315
preferably in advance,
ideally to an off-shore account.

311
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,670
That's why I chose customers carefully.

312
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,394
Say what you like
about warlords and dictators,

313
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,034
they have a highly developed
sense of order.

314
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,151
They always pay their bills on time.

315
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,315
[Spanish]

316
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,629
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

317
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,278
- What are you doing?
- Fuck you!

318
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,435
Fuck you!

319
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,234
Ah, ah... No, Vit!

320
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,314
[Yuri] Shit.

321
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,318
The first and most
important rule of gunrunning

322
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,239
is never get shot
with your own merchandise.

323
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,110
You OK?

324
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,151
[sighs] I think so.

325
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,193
- So what do we do now?
- Let's celebrate.

326
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,960
/# Eric Clapton: Cocaine]

327
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,519
Aah!

328
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,435
[yelps]

329
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,830
That narco-guerrilla
had his facts right.

330
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,999
After shipping it stateside,
the return netted me a healthy profit.

331
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,749
It would've been even better,
except one kilo never made it back.

332
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,679
Vitaly? Vit?

333
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,197
To this day, I don't know
what Vitaly was running away from.

334
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,914
Maybe just from Vitaly.

335
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,999
I found him 12 days,
2000 miles and 1 50 grams later

336
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,316

it's a logical place to start.

00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,679
They're too busy squabbling

505
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,156
over who gets the presidential
holiday home at the Black Sea.

506
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,032
It's beautiful.

507
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,153
The ones who know don't care any more,
and the ones who care don't know.

508
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,479
[Yuri] Mm. Show me your inventory.

509
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,429
Those 45 years of mutual hatred
between the East and the West

510
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,837
had generated the highest
weapons build-up in history.

511
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,952
The Soviets had guns
coming out of the demon hole.

512
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,675
Huge stockpiles,
and now no enemy.

513
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,235
How many Kalashnikovs do you have?

514
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,956
40,000.

515
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,195
Is that a four? It doesn't look like
a four to me. It looks more like a one.

516
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,674
No, it's a four.

517
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,112
It's whatever we say it is, because
no one else will know the difference.

518
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,110
[sighs] Ten thousand
Kalashnikovs for a battalion.

519
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,840
Your stocks
are dangerously depleted, Dmitri.

520
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,679
You should order more from the factory.

521
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,552
Someone will work it out.

522
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,678
- What happens then?
- We'll cut them in.

523
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,394
The end of the Cold War

524
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,478
was the beginning
of the hottest time in arms dealing.

525
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,636
The arms bazaar was open.

526
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,400
Guided missiles, unguided missiles.

527
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,353
Mortars, mines,
armoured personnel carriers.

528
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,471
Whole tank divisions.

529
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,752
[Russian]

530
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,034
I even landed a squadron
of helicopter gunships.

531
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,634
The most sophisticated
fighting machines,

532
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,638
built for a war with America
that never happened.

533
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,115
[Russian]

534
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,159
Thanks to me, they'd finally
get to fire a shot in anger.

535
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,796
I have a feeling it wasn't exactly
what Comrade Lenin had in mind

536
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,117
when he advocated
the redistribution of wealth.

537
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,359
But I wasn't the only one
offering a crash course in capitalism.

538
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,515
I had rivals.

539
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,753
Inform your commanding officer
that Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

540
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,798
You don't know who I am, do you?

541
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,433
[Russian]

543
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,074
You're late.

544
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,559
So it appears.

545
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,718
[# Russian folk music]

546
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,668
You look a little lost, Simeon.
Is the world changing too fast?

547
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,872
- I'm here, aren't l?
- Not all of you, I think.

548
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,310
You've gotten so rich
selling for the ClA,

549
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,318
you can't get that ideology
out of your head.

550
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,478
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

551
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,478
Kept the tensions frozen.

552
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,831
Now it's harder to determine...
which side one's on.

553
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,235
Things have become
more...complicated.

554
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,998
No, it's gotten simpler.

555
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,237
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics any more.

556
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,670
I sell to leftists and rightists.

557
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,634
I'd sell to pacifists, but they're not
the most regular of customers.

558
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,512
You're not an internationalist

559
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,679
until you've supplied weapons
to kill your own countrymen.

560
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,429
This current state of chaos
won't last forever.

561
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,396
There'll have to be order.

562
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,719
Instead of cutting
each other's throats, it...

563
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,071
...may be beneficial if we work
together. What do you think?

564
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,399
What do I think?

565
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,914
I think you are the amateur now,

566
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,999
and I think you should go with your
instincts, with your first instinct.

567
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,670
I'm the same man who was
not good enough for you before, and...

568
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,633
...I'm just not good enough for you now.

569
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,673
The problem
with gunrunners going to war...

570
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,355
...is that there's no shortage
of ammunition.

571
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,550
This was the chaos
that the old guard had always feared.

572
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,196
As far as they were concerned,
I was giving arms dealers a bad name.

573
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,552
But then, they could hardly report me
to the Better Business Bureau.

574
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,479
And Ukraine wasn't the only former state

575
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,558
with an unpaid army
and stockpiles of guns.

576
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,151
There was Bulgaria,
Hungary, Poland, Belarus.

577
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,510
All there for the taking.

578
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,951
/# T chaikovsky: Swan Lake]

579
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,993
Of all the weapons
in the vast Soviet arsenal,

580
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,272
nothing was more profitable
than Avtomat Kalashnikova,

581
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,632
model of 1 947,
more commonly known as the AK-47,

582
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,239
or Kalashnikov.

583
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,079
It's the world's
most popular assault rifle,

584
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,998
a weapon all fighters love.

585
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,352
An elegantly simple 9-pound amalgamation
of forged steel and plywood.

586
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,949
It doesn't break, jam or overheat.

587
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,391
It will shoot whether it's covered
in mud or filled with sand.

588
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,717
It's so easy, even a child can use it,
and they do.

589
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,232
The Soviets put the gun on a coin.
Mozambique put it on their flag.

590
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,230
Since the end of the Cold War, it has
become the Russians' greatest export.

591
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,718
After that comes vodka,
caviar and suicidal novelists.

592
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,993
One thing's for sure:
no one was lining up to buy their cars.

How can l?
You keep selling my helicopters!

597
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,114
You are too greedy, Yuri.
I can't hold him forever!

598
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,959
- I've got paperwork.
- Not for the gunships.

599
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,628
You know the penalty
for sanction-busting?

600
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,718
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

601
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,876
Military helicopter.

602
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,518
It's not a military helicopter.
It's a rescue helicopter.

We've met before.
Off the coast of Colombia?

610
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,348
What was the name of that freighter?
Was it the Kono or the Kristol?

611
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,633
The crew called that vessel a lot
of names, none of them repeatable.

616
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,796
The end user certificate for this

Nice. Very nice.
Did you type this up yourself?

- Oh, absolutely.

- Not any more.

Listen to the nephew.

622
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,159
What can they do with military hardware
but convert it to civilian use?

And this stuff?
Is that going to Burkina Faso as well?

To a different client
at a different address.

626
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,109
It's just a coincidence? Do you
take me for a complete fucking fool?

627
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,676
Not complete, sir. And while
I hesitate to tell you your job,

628
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,269
I must point out
that when shipped separately,

629
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,473
the weapons and the aircraft both
comply with lnterpol trade standards.

630
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,558
We both know
that is an obscene bureaucratic loophole

631
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,910
that's gonna be closed
any goddamned day.

632
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,712
But it's not closed.

633
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,912
And while some might
interpret this cargo as suspicious,

634
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,669
we live in a world where suspicion alone
does not constitute a crime,

635
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,394

respect the rule of law.

I was as guilty as sin,
but Valentine couldn't prove it.

He was the rarest breed
of law-enforcement officer:

639
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,798
he knew I was breaking the law,

640
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,833
but wouldn't break it
himself to bust me.

641
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,038
He wasn't the only one
trying to put me out of business.

642
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,629
My uncle had turned down
rival arms dealers,

643
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,796
sometimes with better offers,

644
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,788

you couldn't put a price on loyalty.

00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,068
- What was he doing?
- Hoping to beat your offer.

647
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,875
I told him to go
have intercourse with himself.

648
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,548
- But Yuri...
- You need to make more pay-offs.

649
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,512
- Too many know.
- Don't worry.

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,110
There are more VCRs, cigarettes.
I left them in your new car.

Even your enemy
was admiring that car.

- You forgot what time it is?
- Sorry, l...

657
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,558
How was that... Your audition?

658
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,154
They're going in another direction.
The direction of someone who can act.

659
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,793
They don't deserve you.

660
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,513
Where are you?
Is everything OK?

661
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,871
- It was a rough day at the office.
- Come home.

00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:12,108
- Soon. How's Nicki?
- He misses you. We both do.

I'd better go. I just wanted to call
and hear your voice. Kiss Nicki for me.

671
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,309
32 billion dollars' worth of arms were
stolen and resold from Ukraine alone.

672
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,035
One of the greatest heists
of the 20th century.

673
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,431
[distant voice]

674
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,676
The primary market was Africa.

675
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,475
1 1 major conflicts involving
32 countries in less than a decade.

676
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,432
A gunrunner's wet dream.

677
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,790
At the time,
the West couldn't care less.

678
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,833
They had a white war
in what was left of Yugoslavia.

679
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,919
I did the bulk of my business
in Liberia, "Land of the Free".

680
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,271
Established as a homeland
for freed American slaves,

681
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,711
it's been enslaved by one dictator
or another ever since.

682
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,392
The latest was American-educated,
self-declared president Andre Baptiste.

683
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,353
[# rap music]

684
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,630
- [revving]
- Mr Yuri!

685
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,751
Andre Baptiste Jr.

686
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,352
- My father would like to meet you.
- What an honour.

687
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,549
[revving]

688
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,320
Thank him.
Unfortunately I have other business.

689
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,671
It's a shame.
It's...It's a very busy schedule.

690
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,031
[revving]

691
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,549
It is not,

692
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,478
as they say,

693
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,750
optional.

694
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,838
My father is easily offended.

695
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,796
My schedule just freed up.

696
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,794
President Baptiste was my best customer,
but I was in no hurry to meet him.

697
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,437
He's gotten a reputation for hacking off
the limbs of those who opposed him.

698
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,108
His seven-year civil war
has been described as

699
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,551
"a relentless campaign
of sadistic, wanton violence. "

700
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,354
That kind of sums up Andy for me.

701
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,676
The Glock is interesting.

702
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,558
It's made of a polymer composite.

703
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,912
Many feel they can get through airport
security without setting off bells.

704
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,838
I do not recommend that.

705
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,033
On the other hand, if you are looking
for a traditional wheel gun,

706
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,279
there's no substitute for the six inches
of muzzle energy of the.357 Magnum.

707
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,436
And, of course, it will never jam.

708
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,194
- Why'd you do that?
- What did you say?

709
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,639
Now you're gonna have to buy it.
It's a used gun.

710
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,560
How can I sell a used gun?
[snorts]

711
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,156
"A used gun."

712
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,873
"A used gun"?

713
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,477
That's a good one.

714
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,030
You know, there is no discipline
with the youth today.

715
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,074
I try to set an example,
but it is difficult, huh?

716
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,395
- Personally, I blame MTV.
- [distant gunfire]

717
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,756
"A used gun."

718
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,476
I think, you and l,

719
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,398
we can do business.

720
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,229
If I thought I was scared
of Andre Senior,

721
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,954
I knew I was scared
of Andre Junior.

722
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,832
Like father, like son.

723
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,112
The guava doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

724
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,639
He was also a cannibal.

725
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,957
They say he would eat
a victim's heart while it was beating,

726
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,310
to give him superhuman strength.

727
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,318
[gunfire]

728
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,271
Monrovia itself
was like being on another planet.

729
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,198
Planet Monrovia.

730
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,598
From the temperature, it was obviously
a planet close to the sun.

731
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,031
I rarely saw another white man,
and I never left town alone.

732
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,392
Outside town was the edge of hell.
I didn't wanna even gaze into it.

733
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,071
[Andre Jr] This is your hotel.
Two stars.

734
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,076
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

735
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,556
- Part one, two or three?
- I've only seen part one.

736
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,638
The M-60. Would you like
the armour-piercing bullets?

737
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,114
Please.

738
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,750
My father left a welcoming present
in your room.

739
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,598
Enjoy. [laughs]

740
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,436
[distant gunfire]

741
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,158
[French]

742
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,592
My God.
She nearly got her head cut off.
