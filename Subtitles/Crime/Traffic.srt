1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,930
(Video Game)

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,530
(Continues)

3
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,480
(Officer Laughs, Remarks In Spanish)
(Speaking Spanish)

4
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,660
(Spanish)

5
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,150
(Humming)

6
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,490
(Humming)

7
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,790
(Sighs)

8
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,600
[Man] This informant, paid by
police, using taxpayers dollars...

9
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,300
to continue his felony
drug habit, was the link...

10
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,280
that allowed the police
to raid a private farm,

11
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,540
a working farm where honest
Americans make their living.

12
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,420
The government, in its haste,
has hired an army of criminals...

13
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,780
- whose allegiance to the truth
is at best questionable.
- Mr. Rodman...

14
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,960
it's a shame that your client
didn't use as much sense...

15
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,290
in choosing what he planted...

16
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
as he did
in choosing his attorney,

17
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,960
but, lately,
the only variation...

18
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,230
I'm hearing in your argument
is the name of your client.

19
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,000
You can stand here all day and argue
the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates,

20
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,100
but you're not
going to convince me...

21
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,640
that our government has not sanctioned
the use of anonymous informants.

22
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,280
Furthermore, there is no sacred protection
of property rights in our country.

23
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,260
You grow marijuana on your farm,
be it an ounce or an acre,

24
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,690
that farm can be seized...

25
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,030
and that farm can be sold.

26
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,860
(Knocks)

27
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,940
What the hell is that?

28
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,200
You can tell a lot about somebody
from this stuff.

29
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,270
- It's from your friends at
Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
- A fishing rod.

30
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,180
- What do you think they want?
- Depends what state they're from.

31
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,180
Uh... Arizona.

32
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,010
Arizona.

33
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,250
Medicinal marijuana initiative.

34
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,290
Or am I being cynical?

35
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,850
Mark... I'm going to miss you.

36
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,190
Thank you for all your hard work.

37
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,300
(Coughs)

38
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,710
[Judge]
Hi. How are you today?

39
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,570
You've got a daughter.
Why is it important to get
a handle on this drug problem?

40
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,200
Because it's an issue
that affects all families.

41
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,340
- But I'm planning on being back
here as much as I can.
- How do you feel about...

42
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,570
[Man] Okay, Gordon, no telltales:
no scratching your nose,

43
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,740
no clearing your throat,
no crossing your legs.

44
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,750
- [Gordon] I got it.
- You got it, babe.

45
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,910
I'm cool, man.
You just don't tell any jokes.

46
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,080
- "Don't tell any jokes"?
- Don't tell jokes. It's a giveaway, Ray.

47
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,950
- It's not a giveaway.
- Every time you tell a joke,
it's a giveaway.

48
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,960
- Don't tell any jokes.
- You know what the problem is?
You are too uptight, man.

49
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,460
Why don't you loosen up,
take a deep breath? (Inhales)

50
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,630
Breathe in slowly.
A little stretching maybe.

51
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,640
- Come on, man. They're looking at us.
- Come on, man.

52
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,670
We're going to get these motherfuckers.
We know our shit.

53
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,470
Can I get it?
Can I get it?

54
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,240
- Oh, baby, can I say it?
- Say it. It's show time.

55
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,780
[Ray] We're looking for Mr. Eduardo
Ruiz. We have a 2:00 appointment.

56
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,450
[Woman] He's right down the
hallway in the back room.

57
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,490
Thank you.

58
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,900
[Ruiz]
Come in. Hey, fellas.

59
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,990
[D.E.A. Agent]
Come on, you guys. Get him talking.

60
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,300
- Get him outside.
- (Door Closes) How you doing?

61
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,240
- [Ruiz] I'm well. How are you?
- I'm good.

62
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,310
Look, what's up, Ed?
We going to move some white or what?

63
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,110
You guys ever bought
a quarter ton before?

64
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,350
- No?
- [Ray] I don't think so.

65
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,390
[Ruiz]
It's a big fucking deal, all right?

66
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,390
It's not like you can stick it
in a condom up some mule's asshole.

67
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,190
How many peasants is that going
to take? You'd have a line
from here to Mexico City.

68
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,890
You say show up at a time, we show up at
the time and we're fucking sitting here.

69
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,200
- Sure I can't offer you something to drink?
- I can offer you a joke.

70
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,670
You want to hear a joke? I got
a joke, I got a joke. Come on, bro.

71
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,010
It's just a joke. Let me tell one joke.
I'm going to tell you a joke.

72
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,340
All right, why are hurricane
named after women?

73
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,680
- I don't know.
- Because when they arrive,
they're wet and wild.

74
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,580
When they leave, they take
your house and your car.

75
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,190
(Ray Laughing)

76
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,920
- It's true.
- You didn't find that funny?

77
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,960
I chuckled. Damn.

78
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,000
- Fellas... that's us.
- Yo.

79
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:10,200
Okay, that's the van. Don't make
your move until they get Ruiz outside.

80
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,710
[Ruiz] I told you there
was nothing to worry about.

81
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,840
I got another joke.

82
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,390
- Come on. Please.
- Just one more. Relax.

83
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,920
A guy goes, gets a tattoo
put on his penis.

84
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,580
One side says yes,
the other side says no.

85
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,920
- On his penis?
- Yeah. The words "yes” and "no."

86
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:37,400
So, his wife says, "Hold it. You tell me
how to cook, how to clean the house..."

87
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,270
- Who the fuck is that?
- That's local.

88
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,170
What the fuck is going...

89
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,500
Shit! Agent down!

90
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,130
Get in there now! Go!

91
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,150
(Confused Shouting)

92
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,720
(Automatic Gunfire Continues)
D.E.A.!

93
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:09,560
(Shouting, Gunfire Continues)

94
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,530
The vest caught it.
Go ahead.

95
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,610
Go. Shit.

96
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,010
(Groans)

97
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,040
(Grunts)
Shit!

98
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,310
(Muttering)

99
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,090
(Door Opens)

100
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,800
- I think we lost him, Ray.
- Yeah, I think so too.

101
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,550
(Screaming)
Don't fucking move! Get your hands...
Move!

102
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,680
Get out, you son of a bitch!
Get out!

103
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,220
[Girl] Is this what
they wear to go to sleep...

104
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,260
or do they hang out like this
the whole time?

105
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,460
- [Boy] That would be sleep attire.
- It's like a smoking jacket.

106
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,970
He's going to be smoking
in a minute.

107
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay, who's the father of
Greek tragedy? Anyone? Anyone?

108
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,630
Okay, Aeschylus it is.
His trilogy? The Oresteia.

109
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,440
This is fucking beautiful. Can anyone...
Can anyone stop the Seth machine?

110
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,240
- No.
- That's correct. Score.

111
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,080
(Snorting)

112
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,750
And "tragedy" is closed out.

113
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,290
(Clears Throat, Sniffs)

114
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,790
(Boy Laughing)
[Girl] But wait.

115
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,890
- Is he her husband?
- Yes.

116
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,090
Oh, hey, so, uh...
you want to try something?

117
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,170
Yeah.

118
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,450
- What are you doing?
- Just watch.

119
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,830
What you're going to do is
inhale the smoke and hold it.

120
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,990
What is this, like freebase?

121
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,040
Not "like." It is.

122
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,970
Okay, go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

123
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,550
Hold it.
Hold it.

124
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,590
See?

125
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,490
Now you see.

126
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,060
[Woman]
Oh, how... Oh, they're doing great.

127
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,900
Look at how cute they are.

128
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,400
- [Woman #2] Helena, he's doing so good.
- Little Tiger.

129
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,480
[Helena]
Little Tiger, I hope.

130
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,170
We'll be very happy if he
becomes the next Tiger Woods.

131
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,180
So will his bank balance.

132
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,220
- [Woman] My God. Duck?
- Duck. Thank you very much.

133
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,550
- Helena, you never order duck.
- I know, I know.

134
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,350
It's not me who ordered it.
It's somebody else.

135
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,050
Well, he or she
has very good taste.

136
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,460
- I love duck, don't you?
- It's delicious. Do you want some, Nan?

137
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,620
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- It's such a fatty bird.

138
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,290
There's good cholesterol, and there's
bad cholesterol, which is confusing to me.

139
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,100
- Mmm, that's so good.
- You know what they say about red wine.

140
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,330
It's good for you.
There's cholesterol in my wine.

141
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,270
- You're allowed to have your red wine.
- The French do, don't they?

142
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,240
I'm European.
I say that to my doctor.

143
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,410
"I'm European.
I'm allowed to drink red wine."

144
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,750
Oh, my doctor said it was fine
when I was pregnant.

145
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,910
- A glass a week.
- After my amnio,

146
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,250
he said, " Okay, now you can go
and have a glass of red wine."

147
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,660
I had two. (Laughing)
(All Laughing)

148
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,960
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

149
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,970
- Thanks a lot.
- Can I bring the bag in the back with me?

150
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,830
- No, sweetheart.
- How about just my putter?

151
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,130
- Give me the putter.
- All right.

152
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,300
In you get. Come on.
We've got to go.

153
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,110
Put this down here, okay?

154
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,740
That's where Tiger Woods keeps it.
Thank you.

155
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,940
- [Valet] You're welcome.
- Okay.

156
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,620
David, you're going to have to promise me,
no swinging the club in the car.

157
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,320
[David]
Okay.

158
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,660
[Man] Until you officially take over the
Office of National Drug Control Policy,

159
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,700
under no circumstances will you speak
to the press unprotected...

160
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,740
without going through this office...

161
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,170
or having someone in the room.

162
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,500
There are a lot of interests
in this town.

163
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,510
Right now,
they're scared of you.

164
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,270
The reason they're scared of you:
Technically, you have veto
powers over their budgets.

165
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,820
You'll also be meeting
senators and congressmen,

166
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,150
each with a specially
prepared question.

167
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,810
They're questions designed for
one thing... to make them look smart.

168
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,220
If you lecture them,
they won't think you respect them.

169
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,790
If you treat them
with utter humility, they will.

170
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,330
This is about your respect for them
and the president's respect for them.

171
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,370
Speaking of which, when he
gets back from Russia and China,

172
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,870
we'll get you two together for
some face time, let you two catch up.

173
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,930
Also, one month from today, you will
give your first official press conference.

174
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,840
In it, you will outline the president's
strategy for winning the war on drugs.

175
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,880
[Man #2] Judge, I just want
to be clear about one thing:

176
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,180
I am not a partisan person,
I am an issue person.

177
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,850
Over the course of the next few weeks,
if you allow me,

178
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,510
I will bring you up to speed
on an incredible array of issues,

179
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,960
the most important of which,
in my opinion, Mexico.

180
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,220
I know everyone you're going to meet.
I know what they want and why.

181
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,560
It is important
that they like you.

182
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,900
It is not important
that they like me.

183
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,560
That is why
I can help protect you.

184
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,400
Like you protected Landry?

185
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,740
(Clears Throat)
I see where you're going with that.

186
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,870
If I could say one thing: Basically,
a guy like Landry is so autocratic,

187
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,510
he doesn't even know how
to let himself be helped.

188
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,050
There's a political component
to this job that the general
didn't have any patience for.

189
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,260
General, Bob Wakefield.

190
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,490
- Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.

191
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,930
Jeff, you want to excuse us?
(Stammers, Clears Throat)

192
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,500
Yes, sir.
I'll be right outside.

193
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,090
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

194
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,170
You've done a fine job, General.

195
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,760
The Office of National
Drug Control Policy...

196
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,370
is in better shape
than when you found it.

197
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,570
I'm not sure I made
the slightest difference.

198
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,080
I tried. I really did.

199
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,090
I think there are some positive signs.
The work's just started.

200
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,450
I plan on seeing it through.
You can count on that.

201
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,960
You're here for two years,
three maximum.

202
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,500
What'd they offer you,
a court appointment?

203
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,960
District? Appeals?
Not Supreme.

204
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,300
This is a tough enough job.
I plan on focusing on this.

205
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,310
(Chuckles)

206
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,000
You know, when Khrushchev
was forced out,

207
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,270
he sat down, he wrote two letters
and gave them to his successor.

208
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:50,120
He said, " When you get yourself
into a situation you can't get out of,

209
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,780
"open the first letter,
and you'll be saved.

210
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,950
"And when you get yourself into
another situation you can't get out of,

211
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,120
open the second letter."

212
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,490
Well, soon enough, this guy
found himself in a tight place,

213
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,130
so he opened the first letter,
which said, "Blame everything on me."

214
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,000
So, he blamed the old man.
It worked like a charm.

215
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,670
He got himself into a second situation
he couldn't get out of,

216
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,640
and he opened the second letter.

217
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,310
It said, " Sit down
and write two letters."

218
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,510
(Chuckles)

219
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,020
Yeah.

220
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,860
[Woman] Don't you want to
know what kind of car it is?

221
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,670
- It's a brown Ford Explorer.
- It was here. It's been stolen.
I want to file a report.

222
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,840
A report will not help you
find your car.

223
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,350
- The police won't find your car.
- You are the police.

224
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:58,080
- You call this man...
and he'll find your car.
- I don't get it.

225
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,050
How is this guy going to know
who has our car?

226
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,180
The police will tell him.

227
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,850
Why will they tell him,
and they won't tell us?

228
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,930
Because we pay him, stupid.

229
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,730
Right? And he pays the police,
and suddenly our car appears.

230
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,890
Es correct.
Es correct.

231
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,560
Just give him the money.
Give him the money.

232
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,400
- Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
- Here, take it.

233
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,940
- No. No, no.
- No, please, take it.

234
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,710
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
Let's go to the sidewalk.

235
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,840
Call the man.
Have a nice day.

236
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,210
(Spanish)
(Laughs)

237
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,260
(Spanish)

238
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,260
- Javier Rodriguez.
- Si.

239
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,610
(Spanish)

240
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,860
Bien.

241
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,160
I would say one thing
to you, Judge,

242
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,640
and that's you're never going to solve
this problem on the supply side.

243
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,270
As long as that demand
is out there in our cities,

244
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,850
Mexico bashing is not going to do
a damn thing for you.

245
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,280
We in the legal drug business...
Merck and Pfizer and the rest
of my very important clients...

246
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,150
realize that we're not fighting a war
here with a traditional winner and loser.

247
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,190
I don't know that
you can win this war.

248
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,190
Everybody says we want
to declare war on drugs,

249
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,660
but if 25% of high school seniors
are using drugs...

250
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,670
- If you reduce that to 10,
that's a great improvement.
- Right.

251
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,170
I'll congratulate you.
That would be a phenomenal achievement,

252
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,300
but you'd still have 10%
habitually using drugs.

253
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,570
Can I get a scotch and soda, please?

254
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,010
[Woman] The price of coke
and heroin has dropped,

255
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,770
but purity has increased.

256
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,340
All this law enforcement has
really achieved is that
kids get better stuff cheaper.

257
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,980
Education, rehabilitation,
prevention...

258
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,990
that's not significant
to these reporters.

259
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,020
- Mm-hmm.
- They want to see people in prison.

260
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,060
They want to see the gory aspect
of the drug problem.

261
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,090
Thank you so much for sharing
your point of view.

262
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,530
- I look forward to working
with you in the future.
- Well, call me.

263
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,030
I have a good bill on treatment
on demand. I could use your help.

264
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,600
- Wonderful. Look forward
to it. Thanks, Senator.
- Okay. Great.

265
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,570
If a judge or a politician is willing
to put a reefer in their mouth,

266
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,570
- I'll do a story on it.
- Right.

267
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,570
- Stand up and be independent.
- Right.

268
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,010
I don't care who's president. I don't
care who the members of congress are.

269
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,010
I don't care
who you have to deal with.

270
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,710
If you're independent and you
use that bully pulpit right,
that's where your power is.

271
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,720
It's the stick of law enforcement
that creates...

272
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,850
the carrot of huge profit
that is economic truth.

273
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,920
Addicts don't vote.

274
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,500
What the hell
are you doing here?

275
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,070
You like your view?

276
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,970
- TV screen big enough?
- How's the food?

277
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,370
Hope it's all good because this
is as good as it's going to get...

278
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,210
for a long time, Eduardo.

279
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,620
I'm a legitimate businessman.
I've got tuna boats. I'm a fisherman.

280
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,650
- Check it out!
- Shut the fuck up!

281
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,160
- Fucking can it, bitch!
- You can't come in here like that!

282
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,730
- I want to see my lawyer.
- Okay.

283
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,420
It's cool, man.

284
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,590
- Eddie... you're in a lot of trouble.
- It's cool.

285
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,460
(Door Closes)

286
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,260
You know what? The amount of coke
we found on this creep...

287
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,640
- that's capital punishment
in some states, right?
- Yeah, down in Texas.

288
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,610
- They'll fry him.
- Definitely.

289
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,610
We've got him making
the deal on tape.

290
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,580
We got him bragging
about the quality, about his business.

291
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,080
- We got this motherfucker.
- You're fucked.

292
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,180
No, no, he's fucked.

293
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,050
I only see one way
out of this predicament.

294
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,030
You make us believe
you got a boss, Eddie.

295
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,040
(Scoffs)

296
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,130
Look, no boss, it's all on you.

297
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,180
No.

298
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,110
No, that's a death sentence.
I'd never make it to the trial.

299
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,080
Look, we're going to protect you.
(Ruiz Chuckling)

300
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,020
- Who you working for?
- This is coercion.

301
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,020
(Scoffs)

302
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,120
That's a big word
for a fisherman.

303
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,190
Big-ass word.
Who you working for?

304
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,490
I know another big word.

305
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,590
Immunity.

306
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,570
Take it easy, will you?

307
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,570
What's going on in here?

308
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,640
- We have a warrant to
search your premises.
- What?

309
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,770
Carl!

310
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,970
My husband!

311
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,980
- Relax. Ma'am.
- Carl!

312
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,380
Ma'am, right here.
You can't go any further.

313
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,220
- David, come here!
- [Agent] Ma'am, I have a search warrant.

314
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,020
He'll be back.

315
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,530
[David]
Where are they taking Daddy?

316
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,560
He'll be all right.

317
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,530
He's all right. They're just going to
take him to the office and talk.

318
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,540
Just relax.
They're not going to hurt him.

319
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,870
- I don't understand what's going on.
- He'll be all right.

320
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,530
- [David] What are they doing to Daddy?
- Daddy's going to be okay.

321
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,340
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay, baby.

322
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,200
Ah.

323
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,700
Well... is this
a surprise or what?

324
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,860
An honor.
Thank you.

325
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,200
- Hi, sweetie. (Kisses)
- Good trip?

326
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,140
- How are you?
- Good trip. I'm good. I just
can't believe this.

327
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,840
- What's Washington like?
- It's like, uh...

328
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,010
It's like Calcutta;
surrounded by beggars.

329
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,050
Only these beggars
are wearing $1,500 suits...

330
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,150
and they don't say
"please" and "thank you."

331
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,060
[Mrs. Wakefield] So, we put
the case before the arbitration panel,

332
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,630
none of whom have
any expertise.

333
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,630
"Superfund" is just
one of those words.

334
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,640
People stop paying attention.

335
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,110
- It's frustrating.
- It's so frustrating.

336
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,110
Did you meet the president?

337
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,700
Honey, your father
knows the president.

338
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,710
It just so happens... that
the president of the United States,

339
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,720
my new boss,
the leader of the free world,

340
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,950
has penciled me in
for a little face time.

341
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,390
None of my friends can fucking believe
my dad's actually the drug czar.

342
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:00,390
- Caroline.
- I'm sorry, but, I mean, come on.

343
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,430
It's great.
It's great, Daddy.

344
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,090
It's just amazing, that's all.

345
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,770
Arnie, thank God.

346
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,210
Helena, I am so...

347
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,410
Please tell me
what's going on here.

348
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,420
What is going on? They came into
the house. They just took him away.

349
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,080
They searched my home.

350
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,660
Let me tell you what's happening.
All right?

351
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,460
First of all, Carl is not here.

352
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,960
The D.E.A. has got him.

353
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,120
They're going to hang onto him
until his arraignment,

354
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,630
which will probably be tomorrow.

355
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,640
So here you are wasting your time.
All right? Are you with me?

356
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,140
- Yeah.
- Okay. Now, do not discuss anything...

357
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,770
over the telephone.

358
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,110
Don't talk to your neighbors.
Stay out of your yard.

359
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,950
- What is he charged with, Arnie?
- I don't know,

360
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,850
but under no circumstances
am I going to talk about it here.

361
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,150
Now, you go home and be with your son.
All right?

362
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,590
[ Techno ] 

363
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,680
Miss?

364
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,840
Can I have a Budweiser?

365
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,420
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

366
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,590
Can you give me a cigarette?

367
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,870
(Laughing)

368
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,280
(Howls, Continues Laughing)

369
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,820
[Caroline] All I'm saying...
What I'm... What I'm saying is...

370
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:54,160
it never seems like anyone ever says
anything that matters to them.

371
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,670
We all look at each other
and nod with these...

372
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:04,640
these responses
that we've been trained to make.

373
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,830
Responses...
Not real responses.

374
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,970
Social conventions,
like phony, fake smiles;

375
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,140
surface bullshit.

376
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,310
Do I ever just say:

377
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,150
"Hey... I'm uncomfortable
in this crowd."

378
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,690
"I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing either."

379
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,020
"I know you're afraid,
and that's okay, you know, because..."

380
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,860
Hello? Fucking... exactly.

381
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,870
We act like we have all the answers
and we're totally invincible...

382
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,870
like our parents seem
and their parents before them.

383
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm sorry I have to be the one
to say this, but it's fucking bullshit.

384
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,040
- For instance?
- [Seth] I know you jack off to
Caroline every night,

385
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,170
instead of Vanessa,
who you're supposed to be in love with.

386
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,010
Don't even get me started
on that convention.

387
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,020
Because what is that convention?

388
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,380
We're this random collection of self
interests, and all of a sudden we decide...

389
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:56,050
that we're going to walk two-by-two
down the fucking aisle to Noah's Ark?

390
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,890
Actually, for your information,
when I jerk off,

391
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm not just thinking about Caroline,
I'm thinking about you with Caroline.

392
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,230
- So, how about that?
- (Vanessa Groans) Baby...

393
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,910
That is what
I'm talking about... sarcasm.

394
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,210
Always fucking sarcasm.

395
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,870
You're afraid, and you think
that if you admit that,

396
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,380
people will think
that you are weak...

397
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,540
or they won't like you...

398
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,220
or whatever it is
you think will happen, but...

399
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,590
[Seth] Can you shut up for one
second and listen to yourself?

400
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,600
Wh-What?

401
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,970
Because you are so fucking right.

402
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,270
- I'm so fucking high.
- (Laughs) Yeah?

403
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,640
- Yeah.
- Okay, wait.

404
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,770
Why don't we...

405
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,570
change this thing,
this social pattern?

406
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,270
[Seth]
Why don't we be different?

407
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,910
- Yeah.
- But then why are you
even talking about it?

408
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,250
But we're making it,
like, from now on.

409
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,950
You're like,
"Why don't we do something?"

410
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,530
- Why don't you do something?
- That's what I'm saying, Seth.

411
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,030
- You do it yourself...
- I'm saying if you knew it,
you wouldn't even say it.

412
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,030
[Vanessa's Boyfriend]
Vanessa, I'm serious, I feel fucked up.

413
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,330
[Vanessa]
It's a social pattern, you know?

414
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,110
Spence, baby, are you all right?

415
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,150
He's fucking blue.
He isn't breathing.

416
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,340
Oh, my God, Fucked-up Bowman's
fucked up. (Laughs)

417
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,750
- Wait...
- What the fuck do we do?

418
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,150
- Uh... Oh, God...
- Fuck!

419
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:39,190
- Somebody call a doctor!
- Wait, your dad's a doctor. Call him.

420
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,660
No, he's a research...
Call your dad. He's a doctor.

421
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,560
- What kind of research?
- Mapping the fucking pig genome.

422
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,860
Call your dad!
He's a neurosurgeon!

423
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,060
I can't call my dad!
It's 3:00 in the morning!

424
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,160
He's going to fucking die right here
on the floor if you don't do something!

425
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,270
No, he can't die on the floor!
His parents are in Barbados!

426
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,480
Move! Move!

427
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,370
(Siren Blares)

428
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,840
Okay, nobody has anything
on them, right?

429
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,850
Fuck!

430
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,210
(Gasping)

431
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,410
(Flores Screaming)

432
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,710
(Men Laughing, Chattering)

433
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,120
(Screaming Continues)

434
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,120
(Knocking)

435
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,830
I'm on the board
of my son's school.

436
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:37,670
I have fund-raisers
for adult literacy at my own home.

437
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,170
I think I have a right to know if
my husband is a legitimate businessman.

438
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,800
Of course he is.

439
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,080
I've known Carl for 20 years.
He doesn't even jaywalk.

440
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,830
Carl is a very important member of this
community, and when we get through...

441
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,360
suing the police and
the district attorney and the D.E.A.,

442
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,870
they're going to be renaming
the public parks after your husband.

443
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,340
(Turns On Stereo, Increases Volume)

444
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,170
Carl is very, very good
at his business.

445
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:23,010
(Whispers) Which is smuggling
illegal drugs into this country.

446
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,560
- They're whispering. They're whispering.
- I know.

447
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,230
- Can't hear it.
- I know. The fucking bug's too
far away from the room.

448
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,700
It's halfway to the kitchen.
We're not going to get shit.

449
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,710
They're saying something.

450
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,280
Sounds like they're conspiring
to conspire.

451
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,870
I can feel the lies vibrating
from their home.

452
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,210
(Laughing)

453
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,220
I don't think
she's in on it, man.

454
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,880
Come on, I dream about this.
I have actual dreams about this.

455
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,050
About busting the top people,
the rich people.

456
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,890
- White people. Hey.
- White people. I know, I know.

457
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,760
I don't think she's in on it, man.

458
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,770
She knows Arnie Metzger.

459
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,430
So does half of San Diego.

460
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,270
- You want to bet?
- Get in your pocket.

461
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,430
- I got...
- I love it. I love it when you do this.

462
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,410
- How much you want to bet? How much?
- I got... I got 12 bucks.

463
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,070
- Okay, give me ten. We'll make it even.
- Okay.

464
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,170
- Beautiful.
- Wait a minute. What?

465
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,490
- [Woman] How old are you?
- [Caroline] Sixteen.

466
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,260
Live with your parents?

467
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,730
Yes.

468
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,730
Parents still together?

469
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,730
Yes.

470
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:53,300
- Do you work?
- I volunteer.

471
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:57,470
I read to blind people,
one day a week for two hours.

472
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,780
In school?

473
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,610
Yes.

474
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,620
Private?

475
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,660
Yeah.

476
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,790
How are your grades?

477
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:16,630
- I'm third in my class.
- What does that mean?

478
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,670
- I get A's, all A's.
- You do?

479
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,170
What else do you do?

480
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,500
(Sighs)
I'm a National Merit Finalist.

481
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,600
I'm on the Hi-Q Team
and the Math Team.

482
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,310
I'm in the Spanish Club.
I'm a thespian.

483
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,470
I'm vice president of my class.

484
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,480
I'm on the volleyball team.

485
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,760
You want to tell me
what you're doing here, Caroline?

486
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,710
Carol.

487
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,840
Oh, sweetie.

488
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,690
You okay?

489
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,290
It's okay.

490
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,620
[Wakefield] Caroline, how well did
you know this boy that overdosed?

491
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,060
He didn't hang around us.

492
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,900
He was like one
of those hippie kids.

493
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,230
I'm not part of that group.

494
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:38,140
How well did you know this boy Seth,
the one that was driving?

495
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,880
He's a friend.

496
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,150
He's also the only one that was doing
anything about the situation.

497
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,660
He definitely had
a few beers, but...

498
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,920
it's not like
he wanted to drive.

499
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,550
We just didn't know
what else to do.

500
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,260
It wasn't my pot.

501
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,730
Okay, we understand, honey.
We've got to talk.

502
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,870
Alone.

503
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,750
- I think she's lying.
- Me too.

504
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,410
So let's ground her,
clip her wings:

505
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,790
school, scheduled activities.
That's it till further notice.

506
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:31,160
Robert, honey, Caroline
clearly used very bad judgment,

507
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:36,470
but don't you think spending a night
in jail is punishment enough?

508
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,800
I mean, we've all
had our moments.

509
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,970
- Lord knows, I tried
every drug there was...
- I don't want to hear about that.

510
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,950
You experimented
when you were in college.

511
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,950
Shall we take the quotes off
experiment and call it what it was?

512
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,950
- This is different.
- Why?

513
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:56,290
- She's 16 years old!
- I think she needs to find out
for herself, on her own.

514
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,950
- We have to allow her
room to figure out...
- You want to give her room?

515
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,220
So she can O.D.
like that other kid?

516
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,490
I am not sending out the message that
our family will accept this behavior...

517
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,500
because we do not.

518
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,900
- Correct?
- Of course, but we don't
want to push her away.

519
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:17,140
She has to know that we understand
what she's exposed to.

520
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,740
How long have you known
about this?

521
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,650
How long have you known?

522
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,560
Six months.

523
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,620
Your Honor, this is a man who heads
a large criminal organization...

524
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:23,140
with international contacts
we can only begin to understand.

525
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,800
Our case against him is very strong.

526
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:30,440
He is not a flight risk.
His flight is assured.

527
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,410
The people ask that Your Honor
deny bail. Thank you.

528
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,780
My client is no more
a flight risk...

529
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,010
than Your Honor
or the able prosecutor.

530
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,120
He's a pillar
of his community;

531
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,130
a family man with a wife and child
living in La Jolla,

532
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,700
the community where he has made
his home for the past 20 years.

533
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,730
As our defense
will quickly show,

534
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,730
my client is guilty
of nothing more...

535
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,740
than being the handy target
of an admitted criminal.

536
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,200
Therefore, we ask that you release
Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.

537
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,640
I'm going to deny bail.

538
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,010
[Wakefield] I appreciate you
coming in so early this morning.

539
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,340
[Man] Judge Wakefield,
it's an honor to handle it.

540
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,510
She's a minor. It probably would have
expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.

541
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:47,550
Nevertheless, this is a sensitive issue
for me. I'm sure you can understand.

542
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,180
Like I said, open container,
P.I., misdemeanor possession.

543
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,230
It's easy to make it go away.

544
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:58,560
One thing bothers me: T he kid they
dropped off had coke and heroin in him.

545
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:01,690
Serious amounts.
He's lucky he's alive.

546
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,400
So I've got to ask:
What's your daughter on?

547
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,770
I don't know what you mean.

548
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,110
I mean... have you asked her
what kind of drugs she's tried?

549
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:17,550
No.

550
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,590
I don't know.

551
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:24,590
- Is she in any kind of therapy,
professional help?
- No, no, no. No way.

552
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,660
My daughter is one of
the leading students in her school.

553
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,300
Well, I hope it stays that way.

554
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,780
(Wakefield's Voice)
Yeah, hi, it's Robert.

555
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,680
I want you to clean out my schedule
for the next three days.

556
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,880
Because I'm tired of talking to experts
who've never left the beltway.

557
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,720
It's time
to see the front lines.

558
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,780
(Gasps)

559
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,780
(Turns On Shower)

560
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,440
(Water Running)

561
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,790
[Ruiz] Carlos Ayala started out
in the family connection business...

562
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:39,830
real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats
out of Ensenada, hydroponic strawberries.

563
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:42,460
Then he met up with the Obregon brothers
of the Tijuana cartel.

564
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,970
Using regression analysis,
we made a study...

565
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:48,980
of the custom lines at the border
and calculated the odds of a search.

566
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,140
The odds are not high, and we found
variables to reduce those odds.

567
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,810
So, you pay off
customs officials?

568
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,480
Well, you know, in Mexico...

569
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,820
law enforcement is
an entrepreneurial activity.

570
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,550
Not so much in the States.
Anyway, we, uh...

571
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,820
We hire drivers with nothing to lose and
throw a lot of product at the problem.

572
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,690
Some get stopped. Enough get through.
It's not difficult.

573
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,860
Look, boys, this has worked for years.
It's going to continue to work for years.

574
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,430
NAFTA makes things even more difficult
for you because the border's disappearing.

575
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:23,000
Do you realize in the next year or two at
the outside Mexican trucking companies...

576
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:26,170
are going to be able to go from the States
to Mexico and back again...

577
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,180
with the same freedom
as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx?

578
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:35,380
- It's going to be a free-for-all. -
What, are we on Larry King or something?

579
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,860
(Gordon Laughs)
Shit.

580
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,390
Tell us something
we don't know, Eddie.

581
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,730
You guys remind me of those Japanese
soldiers left on deserted islands...

582
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:46,560
who think World War II
is still going on.

583
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:51,110
Let me be the first to tell you, your
government surrendered this
war a long time ago.

584
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,230
I don't think all this attitude
is going to help in front of a jury.

585
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,710
- It's really a bad attitude.
- Very bad. Very bad.

586
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,970
Look, Ed, there's only one problem
with all this math. You're in here.

587
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,250
Well, I got greedy, didn't I?

588
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,550
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

589
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,060
Decided to bring a little in on my own
and somebody tipped you off.

590
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,600
Carl never would have
been so stupid.

591
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,460
Well, Carl hired you.
That was a mistake.

592
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,340
Carl and I have been friends
since we were little kids.

593
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,740
He was loyal.

594
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,870
(Speaking Spanish)

595
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,890
[Man]
The port of San Ysidro, California:

596
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,920
45,000 vehicles on average,
25,000 pedestrians per day.

597
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:15,390
(Mechanical Whirring)

598
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,300
- In the last six months,
a threefold increase?
- Increase in narcotics seizures.

599
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,130
Would that mean, pro rata, three times
as much drugs is getting in?

600
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,400
That's a scary way to figure it,
but I believe that's true.

601
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:29,810
In my heart, I'd love to say
that we were getting 60 or 70%.

602
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:34,710
In the reality, we're more like 40 or
50% of the total that's approaching us.

603
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,050
And it's all big-dollar issues now.

604
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,050
That's the reason you're seeing
a lot of these murders taking place.

605
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,480
It's one organization
fighting another organization.

606
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,520
When things are good,
people don't kill each other.

607
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,650
When things are bad,
when they're losing dope,

608
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,690
when they're losing drivers
and guys are going to jail,

609
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,760
people start killing each other.

610
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,340
- How's David?
- "How's David?"

611
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,040
- Oh, he's terrific, Carl. Terrific.
- Oh, Helena...

612
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,450
He watched his father
being dragged away by federal agents.

613
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,540
- He's just doing fine.
- Okay.

614
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,280
I can't even begin
to tell him where you are...

615
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,950
and when you're coming home,
if you're ever coming home.

616
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:21,190
Helena... we're going to get through this.

617
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,200
I promise.

618
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,730
- I'll make it up to you.
- Do you have any idea
what's going on out here?

619
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,930
Huh? Our credit cards are maxed.

620
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,270
The people in the bank... you should see
the way they look at me when I walk in.

621
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,470
I have a letter
from the government telling me...

622
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,520
anything I sell from the house will be
taken against an income tax lien.

623
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,740
Our fucking friends...

624
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:49,350
Nobody will help us.
Nobody will take us in.

625
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:52,460
Nobody wants anything
to do with us, Carl.

626
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,820
So, you just tell me
how you're going to make it up to me.

627
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,760
Helena...

628
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,860
Just tell me what to do.

629
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:06,060
I'm not bringing a child into the life
that I was brought up into.

630
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,470
I won't do it, Carl.

631
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,570
I want our life back.

632
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,910

00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,250

643
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,370
Yeah, we're smarter.
We know the difference.

644
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,200
Hello. Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

645
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:15,040
- Hi, folks. - Hello.
- Hi. Room 310, please.

646
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:19,840
- Okay, I need to see some I.D's,
please, and $28.
- Okay.

647
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,740
Man, I love this place.

648
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:51,110
I wish we could
just stay here.

649
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:55,150
Just be here forever
and ever and...

650
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,880
make a little home here.

651
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,760
I want to, uh...

652
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:17,330
I want to have sex and then do a hit
right as we're both coming.

653
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,980
Okay.

654
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,880
[Gordon] The first time I got
laid was on a beach just like that.

655
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,720
- [Ray] You got a what on a beach?
- Got laid, man.

656
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,520
Lost my virginity,
was a sophomore in high school.

657
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,030
- That's cool.
- Yeah, it was sweet.

658
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,130
Did he treat you good?

659
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:35,080
- [Gordon] Who's this guy?
- [Ray] I don't know.

660
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:37,450
- I never seen him before.
- He's going right for the kid.

661
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,860
David!

662
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:48,330
David, come back here!

663
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,400
- Mom, Mom.
- Please, put down my son.

664
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,900
(Man Over Headphones) Shouldn't let
your kid wander off with strangers.

665
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,870
(Gordon Over Walkie-Talkie)
Karen, if he tries to move
with that kid, you break cover.

666
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:03,430
Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes a
lot of money. Snapping this
kid's neck wouldn't cover it.

667
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,450
You better come up with it in a hurry
or your kid is going to disappear,

668
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,180
and he won't turn up
until the evening news.

669
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,810
You get only one warning.
First payment is $3 million.

670
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,540
- Javier.
- Yes?

671
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:19,070
(Speaking Spanish)

672
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,550
(Spits)

673
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:54,440
- John, how are you?
Bob Wakefield, pleasure.
- Judge, welcome.

674
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,680
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Long time, no see.

675
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,450
[John]
EPIC is very unique.

676
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:03,420
It's a facility that has over 15
different agencies...state and local...

677
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,920
that participate
in gathering intelligence...

678
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:08,320
and making sure
that information gets out...

679
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:12,390
to people in the field that need it
to stop drug trafficking.

680
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:17,330
From here, we have the ability
to track vessels, airplanes, boats,

681
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,530
anything that carries drugs.

682
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,970
When the information comes in, we're
able to check with different databases...

683
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,980
to see if it's
in the system or not.

684
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,810
And would most of that energy
be focused on the two cartels?

685
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,320
The Juarez, the Obregon
brothers... Are those the
two that would be most important?

686
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:35,010
Those are the two
clearest threats right now.

687
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,750
They are the dominant force
in trafficking,

688
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:39,920
both on the Mexican side
and in the U.S.

689
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:43,150
How are the cartels achieving...

690
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:46,430
the level of intelligence and
sophistication that they're showing?

691
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:49,500
- [John] Craig, why don't you answer that?
- An unlimited budget.

692
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,200
So, you're saying, actually,
that even a country of our size...

693
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:56,000
and the budget that we throw
towards this issue,

694
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:59,270
- they can compete at the same level?
- No, they're way beyond us.

695
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,750
- "Way beyond"?
- Our budgetary process
makes us pale in comparison.

696
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:10,090
[John] That house you're looking at over
there used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.

697
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,590
His nickname was Scorpion.

698
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:14,720
I'll let you figure out
what that means.

699
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,330
Wasn't that the guy
who died during plastic surgery?

700
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,730
Best of our information, yes.

701
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:22,300
Who do you interact with
on that side?

702
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,700
Nobody.

703
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:27,400
Well, who has my job in Mexico?

704
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:30,640
Your position doesn't exist
over there yet.

705
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:41,150
(Wakefield's Voice) I want
everyone thinking out of the box...

706
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,220
for the next few minutes.

707
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,990
What are we doing about Mexico?

708
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:49,360
- Come on, guys, out of the box.
- [Man] Unlimited funds?

709
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:51,590
Unlimited.

710
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,530
From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need
a vetted task force and matching funds.

711
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,300
And cut the red tape on getting them
equipment and training.

712
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,310
Come on, guys,
I want to hear from everyone:

713
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,170
F.B.I., customs, treatment.

714
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,910
- Is there anybody from
treatment on this plane?
- No, Judge.

715
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,080
Then, I want to know why there isn't
anybody from treatment on this plane.

716
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:13,150
Yes, sir.

717
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:17,250
We need to take down one of
these cartels... Juarez or Tijuana...

718
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:19,420
not because they're a symbol, but...

719
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,460
Hell, they are a symbol.
But because we need to send a message.

720
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,300
When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler
as his legal defense,

721
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,460
I send Ben Williams
down to San Diego as a prosecutor.

722
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:34,440
Why? Because it's a symbol.

723
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:37,740
It's a symbol that
we are sending the best.

724
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:42,370
It's a message that we're
going after their top guys.

725
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,950
So...

726
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:47,110
right now...

727
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:50,780
on this flight only...

728
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,320
the dam is open...

729
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:56,660
for new ideas.

730
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:09,470
On a clear day,
you can see Mexico City.

731
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:13,140
I have this place swept twice a day,
so just feel free to talk.

732
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,150
I learned that back
in Miami in '85.

733
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,310
U.S. shut down
the entire Caribbean.

734
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,720
- It's a big game of whack-a-mole.
You knock it down in Miami...
- Arnie, I need money.

735
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:27,160
Somebody... I think it was the Obregons...
threatened David.

736
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,530
They want a first payment
of $3 million.

737
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,860
Oh, Helena.
(Sighs)

738
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:37,330
I'd give it to you myself, but I-I-I
just don't have that kind of money.

739
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,340
Please. Does anyone owe us money?

740
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,000
Yes, there are people that do owe
you money, but nobody's going to pay.

741
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:46,940
Carl's got too much heat on him.

742
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:51,180
What about our other businesses,
our legitimate businesses?

743
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:55,220
- Don't we own a construction...
- Laundromats wash the money.

744
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,520
Just tell me something
positive, Arnie.

745
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,350
Give me some good news,
for Christ's sake.

746
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,390
I'm sorry.

747
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:10,390
I just keep wondering what's
going to happen if he doesn't get out.

748
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,960
Just never been
on my own before.

749
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:17,700
Always had someone. Always.

750
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:30,210
I remember the first time
that I saw you...

751
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:35,260
little Helen Watts
from the wrong side of somewhere.

752
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:41,200
Somehow I knew even then that your
survival skills were pretty well honed.

753
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,900
Glad you think so, Arnie.

754
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:49,670
I just keep picturing a debt-ridden,
30-year-old mother of two...

755
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:53,910
whose ex-husband
is being compared to Pablo Escobar.

756
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:59,910
I don't know anyone who wants
to be with someone like that.

757
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,320
Do you?

758
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,770
[Wakefield] I think we
may have found our Mexican drug czar.

759
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,820
General Salazar.

760
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,480
Be nice to have somebody
to work with down there.

761
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,990
Does this mean you're
going to be gone more?

762
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:41,260
Possibly, yeah.

763
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:47,460
You might want to pencil in
a little face time with your daughter.

764
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:50,300
- Barbara...
- Because I'm at the edge
of my capabilities, Robert.

765
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:53,570
I think it's important
we maintain a unified front.

766
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,770
If you start in
on the war metaphors,

767
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:57,970
I'm going to drive this car
into a fucking telephone pole.

768
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:01,640
- I am as worried as you are.
- Oh, I don't think so.

769
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,680
"Leave me alone.
Give me some money."

770
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,150
That's what I get
from our daughter.

771
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,780
She has a way of shutting me out
that seems very familiar.

772
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:14,830
Well, she has a way of self-medicating
that I'm sure is very familiar to you.

773
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:17,090
(Scoffs)

774
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,170
I'm not the one who has
to have three scotches...

775
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,170
just to walk in the house
and say hello.

776
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:24,500
I have one drink before dinner
to take the edge off. It's different.

777
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:28,840
- Oh, is it?
- Otherwise, I would be dying of boredom.

778
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:49,360
Why don't you go in and tell
your daughter how bored you are?

779
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,250
(Caroline Flicking Lighter)

780
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:49,120
[Wakefield]
Caroline, open this door immediately.

781
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:52,390
Who is it?
I'm going to the bathroom.

782
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:54,830
- Open the goddamn door!
- [Caroline] One minute.

783
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:04,100
Excuse me.
I have to go to bed.

784
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,830
Oh, Jesus.

785
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,320
You are not going anywhere, young lady.

786
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:20,620
You stay right there.

787
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,300
Where are they?

788
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:31,470
Where the hell are the drugs?

789
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:33,630
Where are they?

790
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,670
Fuck you.

791
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:37,740
Fuck you.

792
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,970
I wasn't doing anything.
You're like the Gestapo.

793
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:46,510
Fuck me. Fuck me.
Well, fuck you!

794
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,260
- [Driver] Javier, good to see you.
- How you doing, partner?

795
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:41,530
Did you take the precautions
we discussed about being followed?

796
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,870
- Yes, of course.
- Will you move to the middle, please?

797
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,870
- You're not carrying a weapon?
- No.

798
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:48,370
- Of course not.
- Where are you taking me?

799
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:51,410
- Somewhere safe.
- Where?

800
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:54,210
A place we have that we know
is protected. He's good. Let's go.

801
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,510
- [Javier] No, no. No, no, no.
- Don't worry. It's really safe.

802
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:59,310
No, no, no, no, no.
This is safe. This is safe.

803
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:01,910
Come on, Javier, close the door.
Everything is cool, all right?

804
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:04,750
- This is safe.
- Come on.

805
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:07,230
All right.

806
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,850
Where would you like to go?

807
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,300
- Huh?
- Where do you want to go, Javier?

808
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:27,010
[Javier] I believe it's
important that we work together.

809
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,780
Mexico and the United States.
One hand washing the other.

810
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:33,750
We agree.

811
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:36,850
So, maybe you can tell me
about your informants in our operations.

812
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:43,090
We thought that maybe you'd have
that kind of information for us.

813
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:48,590
This is a very different
proposition, my friend.

814
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,760
We pay for that kind
of information.

815
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:55,400
[Driver] Is that what
you're talking about, Javier?

816
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,600
Getting paid?

817
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,020
You like baseball?

818
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:05,750
(Spanish)

819
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:11,320
We need lights for the parks
so kids can play at night.

820
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:14,960
So it's safe.

821
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,060
So they can play baseball.

822
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:21,140
So they no become...
(Spanish)

823
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,140
Everybody like baseball.

824
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,230
Everybody likes parks.

825
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:29,710
Listen.

826
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:33,780
I believe it's important that
the United State take an interest...

827
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,970
in Tijuana now.

828
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,560
That's what I'm talking about,
my friends.

829
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,180
[Helena]
Account number...

830
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:49,320
8201-4302-8091...

831
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:51,660
2431.

832
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,490
A cash advance.

833
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,040
How much can I get?

834
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,450
That's it?

835
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,550
You ever try the patch, man?

836
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,560
- The what?
- The patch.

837
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:20,390
- That shit doesn't work, bro.
- It worked for my cousin.

838
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,330
- No shit?
- Yeah.

839
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:26,030
He had to wear five or six
at a time, but it worked.

840
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:28,570
- So, how's he doing now?
- Oh, he's dead.

841
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:33,130
- He's dead?
- It wasn't from the patch, man.

842
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,870
- [Agent Over Headsets]
Okay, she's coming out.
- On it.

843
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:38,910
- What did he die from?
- His wife shot him.

844
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:42,640
[Agent]
She's leaving her property.

845
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:44,720
[Gordon]
Where the hell is she going?

846
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:46,750
Maybe her neighbors.

847
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,090
No, I don't think the neighbors are
fucking with her too much right about now.

848
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:52,750
What does she have
in her hand there?

849
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:58,720
[Agent]
She seems to be headed for the van.

850
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:06,070
Oh, shit.

851
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:10,200
- What... Wh-What do we do?
- I-I don't know. What do we do?

852
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:12,210
- What do you think she wants, man?
- She's your girlfriend.

853
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:14,250
You think she'll invite you
to her baby shower?

854
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,280
- Just say hello. Work it.
- All right, all right, all right.

855
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,610
[Agent]
She's waiting outside the van.

856
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,280
- Hello?
- [Helena] Would you like some lemonade?

857
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:25,450
- I was just making some.
- You want some lemonade?

858
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,430
Sure.

859
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:31,760
[Helena] I know this is a difficult
situation, and you're only doing your jobs.

860
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:35,270
I don't wish you guys
any ill will or anything like that.

861
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:37,500
But I have a favor to ask you.

862
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:39,770
You're asking us for a favor?

863
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,110
Some man threatened my child.

864
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,140
These charges have created
so much attention,

865
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:48,270
it seems to be bringing
all the nut jobs out of the nut jar.

866
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:51,350
Would you keep an eye out
for anything out of the ordinary?

867
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:54,820
- Sure.
- Yeah, of course we will.

868
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,480
- I'd really appreciate it.
- Sure.

869
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:00,150
- Thanks.
- Thank you for the lemonade.

870
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,630
You're welcome.

871
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:12,640
I'm going to get this analyzed
right away, bro.

872
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:18,500
(Man's Voice)
So, it was my birthday...

873
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:21,510
and my ex-wife
was getting remarried...

874
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:24,520
and I was in some church basement
telling a bunch of strangers...

875
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,590
it was a good day because...

876
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:29,020
I didn't have to eat
out of a Dumpster.

877
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:33,360
That was enough to send me
out on a pretty big one.

878
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,830
I've been thinking a lot
about the first step...

879
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:40,660
that I came to believe
I was powerless over alcohol...

880
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:42,830
and that my life
had become unmanageable.

881
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,340
My disease tells me
that I don't have a disease,

882
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,000
that it's my birthday
and I can have one little beer,

883
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:52,840
one little line,
a little Valium.

884
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:57,540
Six months later, I wake up
in a sober-living house in Philly.

885
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:00,210
I'm from Dallas, people.

886
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,880
It's a disease,
an allergy of the body,

887
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:06,390
an obsession of the mind.

888
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:08,690
So, my name is Marty,

889
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,860
and today I'm a grateful,
recovering alcoholic.

890
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:18,030
And it's a good day because I
didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.

891
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,040
Thanks.

892
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:24,710
Hi. (Clears Throat)

893
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:30,740
I'm Caroline.
I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic.

894
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:35,380
I mean...
I don't really like to drink.

895
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:42,220
For someone my age, it's a lot easier
to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.

896
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:50,240
I guess I'm angry.

897
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,240
I mean, I think I'm really angry
about a lot of stuff.

898
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:01,280
I'm just... not sure what.

899
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,800
Listen to me.
I built our house...

900
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,060
and I'm not going to lose it.

901
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:57,870
(Carl's Voice)
My business...

902
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:03,310
that would take a lot
of private study.

903
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:13,140
I suggest...
you look into the Coronel.

904
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:18,020
- The painting?
- Into selling it.

905
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:20,250
If you can stomach it,

906
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:24,030
you should look into it.

907
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:11,610
Oh, my God.

908
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,170
(Salazar's Voice)
Dear Judge,

909
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:15,230
I recruited the best men
in Mexico for my task force.

910
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:20,610
I make the selection, putting them
under a rigorous screening process.

911
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:25,280
And not only physically,
but also psychologically.

912
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:29,410
Judge, I'm sorry for boxes
and the paintings and things,

913
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,690
but I have been too busy
to completely settle in here.

914
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,460
I know you've made very good progress
with the Tijuana cartel.

915
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,790
- Congratulations, General.
- Muchas gracias.

916
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:43,060
I am confident
that before the end of the year,

917
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:46,440
Juan Obregon is going to
be taken into custody.

918
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:51,310
But you must understand that it's
going to be a very difficult task...

919
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:55,040
because of the corruption
in the police force.

920
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:58,520
Hopefully, the exchange
of training methods and information...

921
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,880
between our two countries will help.

922
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:03,180
I hope so.

923
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:07,130
On another note, General,
we were talking about supply.

924
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,990
- Mm-hmm.
- What about demand?

925
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,070
What are your policies
towards treatment of addiction?

926
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:16,300
"Treatment of addiction."

927
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,670
Addicts treat themselves.

928
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:22,870
They overdose, and then there's
one less to worry about.

929
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:33,310
(Counselor's Voice) What I want you to do
right now is write down five triggers...

930
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:35,550
that could lead
to your relapse,

931
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:38,060
that could jeopardize
your recovery.

932
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:43,030
Five triggers.
Your parents, something they could say.

933
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:46,000
Anything that's a trigger for you.
It varies from person to person.

934
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:50,500
Some of us
have already discussed...

935
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,700
Linda, we talked about it
the other day.

936
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,710
I know you have trouble
with your sister,

937
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:58,680
how she's always
kind of outshining you.

938
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:10,260
[Ray] Hey, sugar foot,
how do you like your new home?

939
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:13,190
(Chuckling)

940
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:17,230
You got to be kidding me. This is not
what my lawyers negotiated.
(Scoffs)

941
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:19,230
Please. Fuck your lawyers.

942
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:22,060
You're not getting
any goddamn cappuccino or...

943
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:25,070
- [Ray] Biscotti.
- Yeah, you aren't getting
none of that shit either.

944
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:27,230
- Pick a bed.
- Stay off the phone, Eddie.

945
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:29,310
No long-distance calls, all right?

946
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:32,470
Use 1-800-CRI MI NAL if you do.
(Laughing)

947
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:37,280
(Laughing Continues)

948
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,710
[Man] Mr. Ayala first came
to see me in January.

949
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:46,950
That would have been 1987.

950
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:50,360
He wanted to rent warehouse space
along the harbor.

951
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:54,600
I didn't ask too many questions.
I am a businessman also.

952
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:59,260
I was the company's secretary
from 1991 to 1994.

953
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:03,610
I supposedly worked for all
six companies, but they weren't...

954
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,980
I mean, it was just an empty office
with a desk and a telephone.

955
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,020
I never sold anything
the whole time I was there.

956
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:14,420
Sometimes people came in,
and they got paid.

957
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,320
I- I don't really know
what they did.

958
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:22,120
- [Prosecutor] Didn't Mr. Ayala say
where the money came from?
- No.

959
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:27,290
- Did you ask where the money came from?
- No.

960
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,460
Where do you think it came from?

961
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:31,940
- [Lawyer] Objection. Speculation.
- [Judge] Sustained.

962
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,470
[Prosecutor]
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

963
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:39,600
Did you feel like you were engaged
in a legitimate enterprise?

964
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:44,320
No, not really.

965
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:48,990
Thank you.

966
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,550
You were followed by the police,

967
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:23,450
but they won't be able
to hear us over the children.

968
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,460
(Camera Shutter Clicks)

969
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:29,020
I want to use a bomb.

970
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:34,360
Are you kidding?

971
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:37,200
Can't you just shoot him
or something?

972
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:41,040
I don't really like guns.

973
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,540
You shoot somebody in the head
two, three times...

974
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:48,340
and some pinche doctor
is trying to keep him alive.

975
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:53,410
When are you going to do it?

976
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,420
I don't know.

977
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:02,620
Eduardo Ruiz is the only
real witness against Carl.

978
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:04,660
Security will be very tight.

979
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:12,300
- I may not be able to get to him.
- You'll be able to get to him.

980
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:16,070
If they can get to the pope and the
president, you can certainly get to him.

981
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:18,110
(Chuckles)

982
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:22,740
Careful. You're starting to sound
like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.

983
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:47,270
(Sighs)
Nobody saw her leave?

984
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,780
Hmm.

985
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:52,310
No, I understand.

986
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:54,940
Okay.

987
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,920
(Hangs Up Receiver)

988
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,490
I got to go.

989
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:03,460
I've got to go home.

990
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:06,490
Did you want me to resch...
(Clears Throat)

991
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:08,490
Fine.

992
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,190
(Siren Blaring,
Horn Honking)

993
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:54,400
What you want? Pot? Rock?
Hey, what you want?

994
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:35,610
(Grunting)

995
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:42,940
(Grunting)

996
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:46,320
(Knocking)
Fuck!

997
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:49,150
(Muttering)

998
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:05,300
What the fuck do you want?

999
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:32,370
(Chuckles)

1000
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,000
Yeah.

1001
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:23,550
(Sighing, Moaning)

1002
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:25,810
(Chuckling)

1003
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,300
It has come to our attention that
Your Honor, while in private practice,

1004
01:39:54,410 --> 01:39:56,640
previously represented
the town of Seal Beach...

1005
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:59,680
in their stop-work suit against
the police department of Seal Beach.

1006
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:02,310
We believe this disqualifies you
from hearing this case,

1007
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:06,350
and we, therefore, move for a temporary
suspension until it's investigated.

1008
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:08,650
Mr. Adler, this is
a most unusual motion.

1009
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,660
Nonetheless, Your Honor,

1010
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:14,020
we feel our client deserves
every fairness afforded under the law.

1011
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:19,090
I hope this is not in any way designed
to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.

1012
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:26,430
We will recess until 9:00 a.m.
on Monday morning,

1013
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:30,640
and I will see counsel
in my chambers.

1014
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:49,660
(Flores)
They are coming this way.

1015
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,600
(Speaking English)
They are passing me now.

1016
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:07,450
Boy, there's a lot of them.

1017
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:12,380
Listen, would you mind if we
walked back to the hotel today?

1018
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:15,250
- Walk back?
- Yeah.

1019
01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:21,350
(Flores)
They're not getting into the car.

1020
01:41:22,830 --> 01:41:25,160
What are they doing?

1021
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:27,530
They're arguing or something.

1022
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,740
[Ruiz] It's two blocks.
I could use the fresh air.

1023
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,310
I've been stuck in that piece of shit
hotel room for two weeks.

1024
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:38,000
I don't give a fuck.
Let's just stop standing around.

1025
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:40,240
- I want to walk because I want to walk,
not because he wants to walk.
- Let's walk.

1026
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,320
I like that.
Okay, we'll walk.

1027
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:47,520
(Flores)
They're going past me.

1028
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:55,690
I-I-I do not know. I think
they're going back to the courthouse.

1029
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:00,790
This could be the last chance
to do this! Get out of the
car and shoot him in the head!

1030
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,990
[Ray]
You're a fucking big man?

1031
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:27,320
I'm a real fucking man. I don't fucking
deal drugs to little fucking kids, you...

1032
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:35,670
- [Ruiz] You think you're a badass?
- [Ray] I am a badass!

1033
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:41,200
(Agents Shouting)
Move, move! Get down!

1034
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:44,210
(Gunfire, Shouting)

1035
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:51,580
- [Agents] Go, go, go!
We need an ambulance.
- Go, go, go.

1036
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,250
Ray. Ray! Ray!
Wait a minute, Ray!

1037
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,940
(Siren Approaching)

1038
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,900
Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.

1039
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:03,840
(Gunshot)

1040
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:46,980
(Spanish)

1041
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,980
(Horn Honking)

1042
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:29,680
(Door Opens)

1043
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:50,010
Sorry about the other night.

1044
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:53,880
Me too.

1045
01:49:20,470 --> 01:49:23,070
(Crying)

1046
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:14,260
(Brakes Screeching)

1047
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:07,880
Thank you for coming down here, though I
suspect it has been a pointless journey.

1048
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:11,970
- Why would you say that?
- Bueno, pues, I hear these stories.

1049
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:15,420
Your husband in jail,
his business in chaos,

1050
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,650
various people fighting
over the scraps.

1051
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:22,490
My husband was a victim of an informer
in your organization, not in ours.

1052
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:25,220
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.

1053
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:28,130
Your route has been compromised.

1054
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:31,640
Perhaps it is time for me to deal
with other distributors in California.

1055
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:33,900
- I don't think you're going to do that.
- You don't?

1056
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:36,740
No.
(Laughs)

1057
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:41,610
My husband was working on something
he called the Project for the Children.

1058
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:47,590
- Are you aware of this?
- I don't know. Perhaps
I remember something.

1059
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:55,590
If you want to smuggle narcotics
in Senor Espastico Jacobo,

1060
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:57,930
that is nothing new, Senora.

1061
01:51:58,030 --> 01:52:01,760
No, not in.
The doll is cocaine.

1062
01:52:01,870 --> 01:52:05,770
High impact,
pressure-molded cocaine.

1063
01:52:07,710 --> 01:52:10,770
It's odorless,
undetectable by the dogs.

1064
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:13,810
(Sniffs)
Undetectable by anyone.

1065
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:16,180
I don't believe you, senora.

1066
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:40,200
(Spanish)

1067
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:43,040
I'm six months pregnant.

1068
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:45,110
I won't do it.

1069
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:48,510
- Then we don't have a deal.
- Yeah, right.

1070
01:52:48,620 --> 01:52:51,020
We don't have a deal.

1071
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:55,680
Sorry to waste your time,
Mr. Obregon.

1072
01:52:57,290 --> 01:52:59,190
Okay.

1073
01:52:59,290 --> 01:53:01,160
Okay, okay.

1074
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:05,830
(Snorting)

1075
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,800
- That's good coke.
- It should be. It's yours.

1076
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:17,580
I want our debt forgiven,

1077
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:22,170
I want to be the exclusive
distributor of Obregon brothers
cocaine in the United States,

1078
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:27,080
and I want the principal witness
against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

1079
01:53:33,990 --> 01:53:36,930
Have you told the complete truth
during this interview?

1080
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:41,900
Yes.

1081
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,700
- Alex?
- Solid.

1082
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:48,210
- That's good shit, Javier.
- You know, Javier,

1083
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:50,830
they dump those cell phones
every 24 hours.

1084
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:54,540
Yes, but I have
a contact at MexTel...

1085
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:58,880
who can get me
his new E.S.N. in 12 hours.

1086
01:53:58,990 --> 01:54:00,920
That's good to know.

1087
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:04,920
(Sighs)

1088
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:07,890
So, now that you have
what you want,

1089
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:11,230
let's talk about how
I get what I want.

1090
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:13,560
Oh, you don't have
to worry about that.

1091
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:16,400
You're not going to have
any problems there.

1092
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,870
Yeah, but first let's
talk about what precautions
you're taking to protect yourself.

1093
01:54:20,970 --> 01:54:24,930
You worry about getting me
what I want.

1094
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,440
I'll worry about myself.

1095
01:54:32,150 --> 01:54:36,610
Oye, Javier,
you should feel good about this.

1096
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:42,260
I feel like a traitor.

1097
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:12,710
Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum,
the Obregon brothers' place in Tijuana.

1098
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:14,880
- Yeah?
- She got stopped at the border.

1099
01:56:14,990 --> 01:56:19,390
She was clean,
and she's back in San Diego now.

1100
01:56:19,490 --> 01:56:21,360
Okay.

1101
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:31,540
(Phone Rings)

1102
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:35,370
- Hello?
- Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.

1103
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:37,710
- D-Did I wake you? I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1104
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,870
General Salazar has been arrested.

1105
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:42,410
It turns out he has been working
for Porfirio Madrigal...

1106
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,540
and the Juarez cartel
the entire time.

1107
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:47,920
That is why he was trying to push
the Obregons out of Tijuana...

1108
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:50,250
- so he and Madrigal could move in.
- What?

1109
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:53,350
I thought Madrigal was dead.
I thought that had been verified.

1110
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:56,720
[Sheridan]
Apparently not. It is a shitstorm here,

1111
01:56:56,830 --> 01:57:00,890
but the D.E.A. supplied the information
and was part of the sting.

1112
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,400
So, maybe we can spin this a little,
but I don't know what to tell people.

1113
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:07,740
- So, when are you coming back?
- I'll try to get there as soon as I can.

1114
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:10,070
- [Sheridan] Yeah, okay, but...
- Robert.

1115
01:57:10,210 --> 01:57:14,610
Robert? Robert?

1116
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:16,940
I got to call you back.

1117
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:18,950
[Sheridan] What...
(Disconnects Line)

1118
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:28,580
- [Barbara] My Leica's missing.
- She got the video camera too.

1119
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:31,760
At least we know she's still alive.
Where are you going?

1120
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:35,930
Pawn shops open in an hour. Ten minutes
after that, she'll be at her dealer.

1121
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:39,600
If I can find him,
I should be able to find her.

1122
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:45,980
(Door Opens, Closes)

1123
01:57:49,550 --> 01:57:53,450
[Teacher] Although
ser and estar both mean "to be,"

1124
01:57:53,590 --> 01:57:57,450
they have very specific uses.

1125
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:00,530
May I help you, sir?

1126
01:58:05,330 --> 01:58:07,130
[Teacher]
Excuse me!

1127
01:58:07,230 --> 01:58:10,630
Seth has to be excused.
He's going on a field trip.

1128
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:20,470
I can't believe you brought
my daughter to this place.

1129
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:27,020
Whoa, whoa. Why don't you just
back the fuck up, man?

1130
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:29,180
"To this place"?

1131
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:31,520
What is that shit?

1132
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:34,490
Okay, right now, all over
this great nation of ours,

1133
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:37,320
100,000 white people from the suburbs
are cruising around downtown...

1134
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:41,160
asking every black person, "You
got any drugs? You know where
I can score some drugs?"

1135
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:45,170
Think about the effect that has
on the psyche of a black person,
on their possibilities.

1136
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:49,300
I... God, I guarantee you, you
bring 100,000 black people
into your neighborhood,

1137
01:58:49,410 --> 01:58:53,680
and they're asking every white
person, " You got any drugs?
Know where I can score some?"

1138
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:58,050
Within a day, everyone would be
selling... your friends, their kids.

1139
01:58:58,150 --> 01:59:01,880
Here's why: It's an unbeatable market
force, man. It's a 300% markup value.

1140
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:04,820
You can go out on the street
and make $500 in two hours,

1141
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,890
come back and do whatever you want
with the rest of your day.

1142
01:59:06,990 --> 01:59:11,560
You're telling me that white people
would still be going to law school?

1143
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:32,580
(Knocks)

1144
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:39,550
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

1145
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:41,520
Caroline.

1146
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:44,060
She's been here.

1147
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:46,220
This is a business, man.
Why don't you get the fuck out of here?

1148
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:50,230
I need to find my daughter, all right?
I'll pay you.

1149
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:54,570
All right.
Okay. Hold on.

1150
01:59:57,710 --> 02:00:01,910
Who in the fuck do you think you are?
Where the fuck do you think you are?

1151
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:07,110
- Why the fuck shouldn't I just
put your ass in a Dumpster?
- I got money.

1152
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:09,780
- I got money!
- I got $1,000 in my wallet.

1153
02:00:09,890 --> 02:00:13,950
- It's for you.
- If I want your money, man,
I will take your money.

1154
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:16,090
(Panting)

1155
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,760
Just tell me
where my daughter is.

1156
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:21,330
Please? Please?

1157
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:29,100
Don't do that shit again.

1158
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:40,310
Look, Jesus, man, I'm telling you,
don't do this vigilante thing.

1159
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:43,480
Either the cops are going to find her,
or she's going to call you.

1160
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:45,490
Okay?

1161
02:00:45,590 --> 02:00:47,490
I promise.

1162
02:00:59,570 --> 02:01:01,470
(Beeps)

1163
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,820
Ana.

1164
02:03:11,370 --> 02:03:14,530
[Seth] I know she's in there.
Just let me talk to her.

1165
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:17,440
Look, I know she's in there, man!

1166
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:20,100
No, I fucking know she's in there!

1167
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:26,080
Jesus Christ!

1168
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:28,850
I- I haven't touched her.

1169
02:03:34,730 --> 02:03:37,960
You get the fuck
out of here right now.

1170
02:03:50,910 --> 02:03:52,840
Hi.

1171
02:03:59,450 --> 02:04:01,680
Hi, Daddy.

1172
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:07,020
Hi, sweetheart.

1173
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:09,920
(Crying)

1174
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:19,700
(Crying Continues)

1175
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:40,390
(Woman On TV Chattering,
Indistinct)

1176
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:43,690
[Agent]
Hey, good morning, Eddie.

1177
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,820
- Good morning.
- Big day.

1178
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:51,860
You're a star.
(Snickering)

1179
02:04:51,970 --> 02:04:54,370
Why don't you go take a shower, man?
You smell.

1180
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:56,370
(Knocking)

1181
02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:00,140
- Who is it?
- [Man] It's the Mafia.

1182
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:03,610
- I've got his breakfast.
- [Agent] Coming.

1183
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:09,290
- So who's this going to?
- [Ruiz] Over here.

1184
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,970
- Ooh.
- Fuck off.

1185
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:24,300
- Relax, Eddie. - Yeah, where
has the love gone? Good-bye.

1186
02:05:26,170 --> 02:05:28,230
You know, you're going to be testifying
for about ten days.

1187
02:05:28,340 --> 02:05:30,570
We could just decide
to stop feeding your ass.

1188
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:34,610
You expect me to be grateful
for spending the rest of my
life looking over my shoulder?

1189
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:38,450
Wow, that's...
that's heavy, Eddie.

1190
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:44,950
Can't you for one second imagine
that none of this had happened,
that my drugs had gone through?

1191
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:46,960
What would be the harm?

1192
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:49,250
Huh? What would be the harm?

1193
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:52,090
A few people get high
who are getting high anyway.

1194
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:55,260
Your partner's still alive.

1195
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:58,770
We don't have to have
breakfast together.

1196
02:05:58,870 --> 02:06:00,930
Don't you see this means nothing?

1197
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:03,270
Your whole life is pointless.

1198
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:07,010
You're really breaking my heart.

1199
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:14,480
- The worst part about you, Monty...
- "Monty"? (Laughing)

1200
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:16,490
The worst part about you, Monty,

1201
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:19,920
is you realize the futility of what
you're doing, and you do it anyway.

1202
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:22,790
Wish you could see
how transparent you are.

1203
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:25,020
This food tastes like shit.

1204
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:28,970
So, take your stank ass
and go get a shower already.

1205
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:32,800
Let me tell you something.

1206
02:06:32,910 --> 02:06:35,810
You only got to me because you
were tipped off by the Juarez cartel...

1207
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:37,810
who's trying to break into Tijuana.

1208
02:06:37,910 --> 02:06:41,350
- You are helping them. Uh-huh.
- Mmm.

1209
02:06:41,450 --> 02:06:44,470
So, remember, you work
for a drug dealer too, Monty.

1210
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:47,820
[Ruiz] Fuck me.
(Knocking)

1211
02:06:47,950 --> 02:06:50,890
- Who is it?
- [Man] Breakfast.

1212
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:55,320
Hurry up.
It's getting cold.

1213
02:07:00,070 --> 02:07:01,970
Okay. One second.

1214
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:05,800
- Get the fuck down!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1215
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:09,470
- Get down! Get the fuck down!
- Hey, hey, I'm on your side!

1216
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:12,740
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit. Call an ambulance.

1217
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,850
- Call an ambulance! Fuck!
- [Agent] Palms up. Spread
your damn hands out.

1218
02:07:15,980 --> 02:07:19,010
Shit! Eddie!
(Groaning)

1219
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:23,650
Hold on.

1220
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,950
Oh, shit!
Hurry up with that ambulance!

1221
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:29,690
Shit. Hold on. Hold on.

1222
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:36,200
Your Honor, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

1223
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:40,200
because of the sudden death
of Eduardo Ruiz,

1224
02:07:40,310 --> 02:07:44,610
the people have determined that we cannot
continue our case against Carl Ayala.

1225
02:07:47,310 --> 02:07:50,080
Oh! Oh!

1226
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:54,920
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

1227
02:09:40,290 --> 02:09:42,760
(Knocking)
Yeah?

1228
02:09:42,860 --> 02:09:44,830
Hi.

1229
02:09:45,930 --> 02:09:49,330
I got a copy of your speech.

1230
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:52,170
It's fantastic.

1231
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:54,830
So, Robert, my genuine thanks.

1232
02:09:54,940 --> 02:09:57,070
You're my choice.
You're going to be great.

1233
02:09:57,180 --> 02:10:00,010
The president's sorry he hasn't been
able to spend more time with you.

1234
02:10:00,150 --> 02:10:03,670
After the press conference,
he wants to really sit down.

1235
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:08,050
Oh, and I got to the Post too.

1236
02:10:08,150 --> 02:10:10,880
Don't worry about that thing
with your daughter. It's not news.

1237
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:15,190
They're willing to treat it
as a family matter, personal matter.

1238
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:19,200
Anyway, if it came out,
we could turn it into a qualification.

1239
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:21,360
"I've been in the trenches
of the drug war.

1240
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:24,370
I've seen the face of the enemy.
Et cetera, et cetera. "

[Woman] A sterling reputation
and close friend of the president,

1242
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:29,300
[Woman] A sterling reputation
and close friend of the president,

1243
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:33,040
recently confirmed into the Office
of National Drug Control Policy,

1244
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:37,910
our new drug czar,
Robert Hudson Wakefield.

1245
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:42,920
(Camera Shutters Clicking)

1246
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:51,890
The war on drugs is a war
that we have to win,

1247
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,020
and a war that we can win.

1248
02:10:55,130 --> 02:11:00,900
We have to win this war to save
our country's most precious resource...

1249
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:03,700
our children.

1250
02:11:03,810 --> 02:11:08,250
Sixty-eight million children
have been targeted...

1251
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:11,410
by those who perpetrate this war...

1252
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:17,850
and protecting these children
must be priority number one.

1253
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:27,090
There has been progress,
and there has been failure.

1254
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,530
But where we have fallen short,

1255
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:34,090
I see not a problem,

1256
02:11:34,210 --> 02:11:37,970
I see an opportunity.

1257
02:11:41,410 --> 02:11:44,440
An opportunity...

1258
02:11:44,580 --> 02:11:50,250
to correct the mistakes...
of the past...

1259
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:54,790
while laying a foundation
for the future.

1260
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,800
This takes...

1261
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:06,630
not only new ideas...

1262
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:09,640
but perseverance.

1263
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:15,580
This takes not only...
resources, but courage.

1264
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:17,650
This takes...

1265
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:21,010
not only... government,

1266
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:23,680
but families.

1267
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:27,650
I've laid out a...

1268
02:12:31,060 --> 02:12:35,000
I've laid out
a ten-point plan that...

1269
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:52,080
I can't do this.

1270
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:59,550
If there is a war on drugs,

1271
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:03,690
then many of our family members
are the enemy.

1272
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:12,370
And I don't know how you wage war
on your own family.

1273
02:13:19,850 --> 02:13:23,910
(Reporters Clamoring)

1274
02:13:55,550 --> 02:13:58,280
National Airport, please.

1275
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:47,590
Hey, Arnie, it's Saturday.
You're working too hard, my friend.

1276
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:50,930
Carl, I'm running late.
I'm coming right over.

1277
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:55,970
No, no, no, don't bother, Arnie.
Let me ask you something.

1278
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:58,980
When were you going to tell me
about the $3 million...

1279
02:14:59,110 --> 02:15:03,550
we got in from San Francisco
two days after I was arrested?

1280
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:07,620
Um... I was waiting
for the right time.

1281
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:11,020
Oh. You didn't think you could trust
my wife with that information?

1282
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:13,180
I didn't want to risk it.

1283
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:15,780
That could have been frozen
along with everything else.

1284
02:15:15,890 --> 02:15:18,160
You had it all figured out,
didn't you?

1285
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:20,160
You were going to move into my house,

1286
02:15:20,270 --> 02:15:23,830
raise my kids, sleep in my bed...

1287
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:26,170
with my wife.

1288
02:15:26,270 --> 02:15:28,540
Sounds like a nice plan.

1289
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:30,610
Oh, is it insane?

1290
02:15:30,710 --> 02:15:33,340
Just think about it, okay?
If I was going to rip you off,

1291
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:35,670
why wouldn't I just leave town
after Ruiz was killed?

1292
02:15:35,810 --> 02:15:38,980
Why would I sit next to you
in court and listen to a dismissal?

1293
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:43,380
Let me ask you something. You
think there's a difference
between a reason and an excuse?

1294
02:15:43,490 --> 02:15:46,050
Because I don't.

1295
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:49,420
- Good-bye, Arnie.
- Carl...

1296
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:51,520
Carl?

1297
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:01,530
Come on, sweetheart.

1298
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:04,700
Come outside.
Everyone's waiting for you.

1299
02:16:04,810 --> 02:16:07,240
- Who was that?
- Arnie. He's, uh...

1300
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:09,580
- He can't make it to the barbecue.
- Oh.

1301
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:12,210
- Come on.
- Hi, Helena.

1302
02:16:13,890 --> 02:16:15,820
- [Carl] Hello.
- It's a great party.

1303
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:18,250
- Who is he, a friend of yours?
- Oh, I'm a nobody.

1304
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:20,880
I'm the nobody who arrested you.

1305
02:16:20,990 --> 02:16:23,390
- You're...
- (Laughs) How you doing?

1306
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:25,900
- What are you doing in my house?
- Oh, just looking around.

1307
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,400
You got nice shit. Drug money
buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.

1308
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:31,830
Listen, you don't want to talk
that way in my house.

1309
02:16:31,940 --> 02:16:34,060
You're fucking a murderer, Carl.

1310
02:16:34,170 --> 02:16:36,570
- Fuck you and fuck your wife.
- Hey, you can't be in here.

1311
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:40,110
- [Helena] Get him out.
- You put me out, Carl.

1312
02:16:40,210 --> 02:16:42,180
- I'm a cop.
- I don't care.

1313
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:45,610
- [Helena] Get out.
- Hey! Hey, hey!

1314
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:56,230
- Is that what you wanted?
- A nice little bedtime story, Helena.

1315
02:16:56,330 --> 02:16:58,420
Tell him how you murdered
my partner!

1316
02:16:58,530 --> 02:17:01,090
- You got the wrong...
- His name was Ray Castro, Helena!

1317
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:04,400
Ray Castro!
You remember that!

1318
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:06,770
- What's his problem?
- The carpet, sweetheart.

1319
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:08,770
- No, no, no, I got it.
- I got it.

1320
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:13,940
- Where did he come from?
- Outside, honey.

1321
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:22,650
What do you want to do, man?

1322
02:17:39,910 --> 02:17:42,030
(Chuckles)

1323
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:56,190
(Caroline's Voice)
On the good days, I feel like I get it.

1324
02:17:56,290 --> 02:18:00,160
Like it all makes sense.

1325
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:02,590
I can stay in the moment.

1326
02:18:02,690 --> 02:18:07,500
I don't have to control
everything in the future...

1327
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:13,330
and I believe everything
is going to work out fine.

1328
02:18:16,610 --> 02:18:18,540
O-On the bad days,

1329
02:18:20,310 --> 02:18:24,540
I just want to grab the phone
and start dialing numbers.

1330
02:18:24,650 --> 02:18:28,350
I want to pull my hair...

1331
02:18:28,450 --> 02:18:32,720
and run through
the streets screaming.

1332
02:18:33,930 --> 02:18:37,020
(Sighs)

1333
02:18:37,130 --> 02:18:42,190
But thanks to the people
I've met in these rooms,

1334
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:46,530
like Margaret and Jim...

1335
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:49,540
and Sarah,

1336
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:52,200
um...

1337
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:54,740
I'm pretty sure
I'm going to make it...

1338
02:18:54,850 --> 02:18:56,870
through today.

1339
02:18:57,020 --> 02:19:00,040
(Applause)

1340
02:19:08,330 --> 02:19:10,890
Would you like to share?

1341
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:15,720
Uh... (Clears Throat)
my name is Robert.

1342
02:19:15,830 --> 02:19:18,740
My wife Barbara and I...

1343
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:22,710
are here to support
our daughter, Caroline,

1344
02:19:22,810 --> 02:19:25,780
and we're hear to listen.

1345
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:55,600
