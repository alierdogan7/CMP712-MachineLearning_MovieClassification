DAVEY: You make it sound like
he ain't cooking on the front burner.

695
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,812
If he's so dumb, how come
we haven't caught him yet?

696
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,280
Ladies and gentlemen.

697
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,117
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

698
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:09,412
I'd like to introduce to you
a very brave young lady.

699
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,664
Dr Kate McTiernan.

700
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:17,128
Dr McTiernan will make
a brief statement, and that's all.

701
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,672
No questions, please.

702
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,552
(CAMERAS CLICKING)

703
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,308
Hello, I'm Kate McTiernan.

704
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,689
First, I'd like to say something

705
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,651
to the families who have
a loved one missing.

706
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,487
Please, do not give up hope.

707
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,990
There are other women
where I was held.

708
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,327
And I believe in my heart
that they're still alive.

709
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:54,624
Second, to the boys who fished me
out of the river and saved my life,

710
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,377
and to the nurses and doctors here

711
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,879
who are taking
such excellent care of me,

712
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,508
and for the thousands
of letters and prayers

713
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:08,179
I've received from all across America,
thank you.

714
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,058
And last,

715
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:18,898
to the man who calls himself Casanova,

716
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:23,069
the man who took me
from my own home

717
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,238
and ultimately tried to kill me,

718
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,409
I broke your rules. Just me.

719
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,704
None of the other women helped.

720
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,333
So if you're looking
for someone to blame,

721
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:39,377
blame me.

722
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,758
That's all I have to say right now.

723
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:51,055
Thank you for taking my message
to the families of the missing.

724
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,184
And I hope it helps a little bit.
Thank you.

REPORTER 1: Dr McTiernan...
REPORTER 2: What's the boys' names?

726
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,443
- ALEX: What do you hear? Dogs?
- No.

727
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,447
- Any kind of animals? Is it a farm?
- I don't know.

728
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,783
- Do you hear the river?
- No.

729
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:17,707
I hear him

730
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,376
whispering.

731
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,295
What does he say?

732
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,966
I can feel his mouth on my ear.
His breath.

733
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,470
He tells me that he loves me.

734
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,097
ALEX: Tell me about his face.

735
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,601
Tell me about his eyes, his mouth.

736
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,647
He has no face.

(INHALES SHARPLY)

738
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,154
A mask. He always wears a mask.

739
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,156
- What kind of mask?
- I can't...

740
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,909
- What does it look like?
- It changes.

741
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,163
I can't show him that I hate him.

742
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,751
But you escaped.
What do you see when you escape?

743
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,127
I don't know.

744
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:08,508
I'm just running, and my legs
are heavy from the drugs.

745
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:13,513
And I'm lost. I'm running through
hallways and there are all these rooms.

746
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,431
I don't know where to turn.

(SCREAMS)

748
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,851
- He's behind me!
- ALEX: He's not behind you, Kate.

749
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,186
You get away.

750
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,648
How? How do you get out?

751
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,275
Light.

752
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,863
Light. In the light, in the sun.

753
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,282
- Do you see a barn?
- No.

754
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,951
- A house?
- No.

755
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,452
- Cabin?
- No!

756
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:39,831
There's nothing. Just the light.
It hurts my eyes.

757
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,793
And then the trees. The trees again.

758
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,379
And the rocks are digging into my feet,

759
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,632
and I hear him shouting behind me,

760
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,509
and I try to run faster.

761
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,845
That's all I'm thinking, "Just run faster!"

762
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:59,225
(SOBBING) And I left those girls behind.
I wasn't thinking.

763
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:04,647
- I just told myself to run, to run and run.
- ALEX: All right, all right, all right.

764
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,149
It's okay. It's all right.

765
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:10,319
- I left those girls...
- It's all right. It's all behind you.

with these woods?

SETH: Yeah, I come up here sometimes.

769
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,648
ALEX: What do you run into up here?

770
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,734
I mean, beside the obvious,
hikers, bikers, campers?

771
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,820
Locals, college kids. That's about it.

772
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,825
- What about this river?
- It's good for trout fishing.

773
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,996
It's been that way since
the early colonial period. It's over here.

774
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,414
What? What?

775
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,335
I still have to remember that my niece
wouldn't be fooling around

776
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,629
- with some knucklehead.
- Right.

777
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,593

778
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,012
You okay?

779
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,015
I'm fine.

780
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,852
Really, I am. I'm fine.

781
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,855
I'm just sorry I can't take you to her.

782
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:15,528
I made an interesting discovery
last night.

783
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,029
About what?

784
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:21,534
I ran a check on all the Sistol orders
over the last five years.

785
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,620
- Guess what?
- What?

786
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:28,874
A Beverly Hills plastic surgeon
came up on the list.

787
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:32,295
There's no protocol for Sistol
in plastic surgery.

788
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:34,213
Bingo.

789
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,301
Two years ago,
this guy ordered enough

790
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,053
to treat leukaemia
in a medium-sized country.

791
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,850
- What's his name?
- Rudolph. William Rudolph.

792
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,021
Grew up in Durham.
Did his premed work here.

793
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,235
Dr Cross, is it him? Is he bicoastal?

794
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,572
Bicoastal?

795
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,742
That's an interesting way of putting it.

796
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:07,163
There are about a dozen predators
operating in California now.

797
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:11,584
There's one, male Caucasian,
probably early 30s,

798
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:16,672
he's known as the "Gentleman Caller."
They've been on to him for over a year.

799
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:19,342
And what I realised last night
was that his abductions,

800
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,678
they followed the ones here
by about 10 days to two weeks.

801
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:26,599
Matter of fact, it was exactly 10 days
after Naomi disappeared

802
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,560
that a pretty, black coed
disappeared from UCLA.

803
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,939
- So he's doing it there, too.
- Compulsively.

804
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:37,943
And if he follows true to form,
he's due to hit California pretty quick.

805
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,695
Can the FBI pick him up?

806
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,865
If I get Rudolph to the FBI,
and they make one mistake,

807
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,117
what happens to all these girls?

808
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,704
I can't risk Naomi starving to death
in a cell somewhere.

809
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,376
- No FBI.
- You're going out there on your own.

810
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,588
- I've got people.
- Take me with you.

811
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,216
I think you're best served
by staying here right now.

812
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,634
And pretend like nothing's happened?

813
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,302
No, no, that's not what I was gonna say.

814
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,388
- I just think you should return...
- Dr Cross,

815
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:07,723
I'm the only person who's seen this guy.

816
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:10,309
I know his size, I know his voice,
I know the way he moves...

817
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:12,311
- Kate, I know how you feel. Honestly.
- Would you please

818
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,064
stop treating me like I'm a victim?

819
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:19,568
You think I'm some kind of tourist
in all this because I wasn't raped?

820
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:23,072
Every night, when I go to sleep,
I hear those women's voices.

821
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,325
You want to save your niece?
Well, guess what? So do I.

822
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,506
I don't see my cousin.

823
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,844
- JOHN: Alex!
- There he is.

824
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,972
- Hey.
- Kate McTiernan.

825
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:52,643
John Sampson, DCPD,
cousin, compadre extraordinaire.

826
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,271
- How do you do?
- Hello, Kate.

827
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,982
Meet Henry Castillo, LAPD.

828
01:02:58,692 --> 01:02:59,859
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

829
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:02,862
- Dr Cross, it is a pleasure.
- Mine, Henry.

830
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,823
Um, Alex, can we huddle?

831
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,701
- Excuse me, Kate.
- Yeah.

832
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,328
JOHN: Well, this is a surprise.

833
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:13,789
Time was surprises
made you giddy, John.

834
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:14,957
What's the matter?

835
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,042
Look, we're out on a limb here.

836
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:18,878
Now, I've pulled every string.

837
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:22,631
I've called in 10 years of favours
to get those cars and equipment.

838
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:26,635
This thing has got to go as smooth
as silk, or we are both fucked.

839
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:28,721
Understood.

840
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,161
I've got him, 10:48 a.m.,
crossing the north window.

841
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:57,500
Attention. Rudolph just
walked past the window.

842
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:04,048
Thank you for the update.

843
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,854
It's him. He's on the move.

844
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,439
(STARTS ENGINE)

845
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,882
This does not look like a 7-Eleven run.

846
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,885
Where does this road go?

847
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:51,637
Vancouver.

848
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,278
He sounded so sincere.

849
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:12,741
- How's that?
- When he told me that he loved me.

850
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,538
- I expect that's because he does.
- Please!

851
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:21,500
Multiply your anger
by about a hundred, Kate.

852
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,046
That's how much
he thinks he loves you.

853
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,906
Okay. Rudolph has landed.

854
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:56,368
There's a cabin about a half mile in.

855
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:01,373
So he hasn't travelled that far, after all.

856
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,460
He's back in the woods.

857
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,602
First time in California?

858
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,571
- It's a pretty state, ain't it?
- It's unforgettable.

859
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,785
RUDOLPH: What do you want, huh?

860
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:39,953
Go ahead. What?

861
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:43,207

01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:33,994
Months. Yes, months.

1361
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:36,579
I sacrificed for you.

1362
01:45:37,123 --> 01:45:40,041
But now I'm going to show you sacrifice.

1363
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:44,295
Oh, what are you going to do?
You gonna cut me?

1364
01:45:44,422 --> 01:45:45,588
- Do it!
- (BOTH GRUNT)

1365
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:50,260
Good girl.

1366
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:53,388
(GRUNTING)

1367
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:55,140
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

1368
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,246
(SCREAMS)

1369
01:46:35,264 --> 01:46:37,307
Now I'll show you.

1370
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:47,859
(GRUNTING)

1371
01:47:08,297 --> 01:47:09,464
(KATE GRUNTS)

1372
01:47:30,486 --> 01:47:31,945
(GRUNTING)

1373
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:44,499
(GROANING)

1374
01:48:07,273 --> 01:48:08,356
(COCKS GUN)

1375
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:11,609
Don't do it, Nick.

1376
01:48:13,445 --> 01:48:14,737
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1377
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:21,870
Let's talk about it, okay?

1378
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:25,748
You wanna put the lighter
down, Nick? Please?

1379
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:27,292
She has to know.

1380
01:48:30,379 --> 01:48:31,754
She knows, Nick.

1381
01:48:32,882 --> 01:48:35,300
Then why don't you shoot me?

1382
01:48:37,303 --> 01:48:40,513
I don't think so. Muzzle flare.

1383
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:43,266
Room full of gas, all that, you know?

1384
01:48:44,143 --> 01:48:48,938
Look, Nick.
I'm going to put the gun down.

1385
01:48:51,942 --> 01:48:53,443
Look. See?

1386
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:58,114
There, now. How's that?

1387
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:02,243
I want you to think about this, Nick.

1388
01:49:02,328 --> 01:49:04,871
If you do this,
no one will ever understand.

1389
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:08,374
- Oh, don't mindfuck me!
- No, no, I'm not, Nick. I'm not.

1390
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:09,584
(SHUDDERING)

1391
01:49:12,296 --> 01:49:13,796
NICK: You see, Kate?

1392
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:16,007
It's all about building rapport.

1393
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:20,845
You use the subject's first name.

1394
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:23,806
And your tone.
You've got to keep it soft

1395
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:26,184
and steady.

1396
01:49:27,269 --> 01:49:32,357
- Establish eye contact. Seek his level.
- You want to know the truth, Alex?

1397
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:36,653
- You're the one who really needs help.
- Well, enlighten me, Nick.

1398
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,405
Tell me what truth is.

1399
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:43,326
Truth is looking at a beautiful woman
like our Kate here,

1400
01:49:44,536 --> 01:49:48,039
and saying to yourself,
"I've got to have that.

1401
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:52,835
"I've got to break her down."

1402
01:49:54,463 --> 01:49:58,383
It's your basest animal self.

1403
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:02,887
Dig deep, Alex. You'll recognise him.

1404
01:50:04,723 --> 01:50:06,224
He's ugly.

1405
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:10,186
I've run into him now and then.

1406
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:12,605
Go ahead.

1407
01:50:13,357 --> 01:50:16,818
Reach for the Glock and take me down
before I tell you about the 10 days

1408
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:18,695
I spent with Naomi.

1409
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:23,032
Ten days, Doc.
Things she'd never tell you.

1410
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:26,869
My brown sugar. Face like an angel.

1411
01:50:27,705 --> 01:50:31,207
Perfect. Every inch of her.

1412
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:37,046
You never knew Naomi. Not like I did.

1413
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:41,884
Deep down, you envy me that.

1414
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:45,263
Say it.

1415
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:48,224
I don't work like you.

1416
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:52,061
I don't hate.

1417
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:56,316
You only wish you had the courage.

1418
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:03,323
Good night, sweet Kate.

1419
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,664
(KATE SCREAMING)

1420
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:32,935
Kate.

1421
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:35,605
It's all right, Kate.
