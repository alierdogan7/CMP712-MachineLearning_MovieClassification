00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,341
give me a call.

176
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,176
Sideways don't wanna meet me.

177
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,679
Find itself on the wrong end
of a short rope.

178
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:51,766
Oh, well, that would simplify things
for everyone but you.

179
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,145
Maybe,
if you can find the tree.

180
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,026
(CHUCKLES)
God, I love West Texas.

181
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,615
- Ranger.
- Hi there.

182
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,658
Wasn't much of a robbery.

183
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,744
Got off with just under $7,000.

184
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,789
Took the drawer money,
20s and under, only loose bills.

185
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,499
- No ink pack?
- Nope.

186
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,335
- Smart.
- That was smart.

187
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,420
Can we get a look
at the video?

188
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,590
Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.

189
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,136
This here is Ranger Hamilton.

190
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,596
- Ranger.
- Sir.

191
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,515
Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?

192
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,894
We got cameras, but they're switching us
over to a digital system

193
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,312
that feeds into the computer.

194
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,148
These new cameras
don't hook to our VCRs.

195
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,108
Call over
the Young County Sheriffs.

196
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,319
Ask them if they thought
to hook their cameras

197
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,613
to some sort of
recording device.

198
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,076
- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.

199
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,369
Oh.

200
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,829
Faces covered?

201
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,874
Ski masks, sweatshirts,
baggy pants...

202
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,584
- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.

203
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,169
Tweakers, maybe?

204
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,420
Maybe.

205
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,423
A little early in the morning
for tweakers.

206
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,551
Tweakers don't sleep.
They just tweak.

207
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,138
They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.

208
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,515
Can I take a look inside?

209
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:14,891
Yes, sir.

210
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,559
ALBERTO:
Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.

211
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,687
So they bopped you
in the snozzola, huh?

212
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,814
Yes, sir.

213
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,273
Not very nice.

214
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,196
I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?

215
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,448
Black, white?

216
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,243
Their skin or their souls?

217
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,496
Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.

218
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,289
White.

219
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,668
From around here somewhere
is my guess,

220
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,586
you know, from their voices.

221
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,004

same deal with the branch in Olney.</i>

223

Excuse me.

224
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,928
Do they have video?

225
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,513
Same deal all the way around.

Get your hands off that.

228
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:06,443
Well, these boys, they aren't done yet,
I'll tell you that.

229
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,361
- How come?
- Well, they're patient.

230
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,240
They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.

231
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,701
That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.

232
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,245
They're trying to raise
a certain amount.

233
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,455
That's my guess.

234
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,541

a few banks to get there.

239
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,943
Like I said,
they don't know anything.

240
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,324
When's the last time
you saw them?

241
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,581
When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.

242
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,961
- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.

243
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,713
You talk to them on the phone?

244
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,928
- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.

245
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,221
Go see them tomorrow.

246
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,977
You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?

247
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,864
You've got enough in your front pocket
to fix that problem right now.

248
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,901
We can't spare it,
you know that.

249
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,112
Maybe we should hit
another branch.

250
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,120
You know, you talk like
we ain't gonna get away with this.

251
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,083
I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever.

252
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,501
You?

253
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,382
Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?

254
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,510
Because you asked,

for me to finish this.

that money gambling, didn't you?

the reverse mortgage.

And those bastards paid
the property tax from 2012 to now.

698

That's another $11,000.

699
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,682
So, $43,000
and you are free and clear.

700
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:35,478
Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,

701
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:38,189
and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at Chevron.

702
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,358
- The fax number is on the card.
- Okay.

703
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,193
How much you making
on this deal?

704
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,738
Not near as much
as I'm risking.

You know, they loaned
the least they could.

707

Just enough to keep your mama poor
on a guaranteed return.

her land for $25,000.

01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:59,149
He didn't recognize
Tanner's photo either.

1212
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:02,277
Yeah, tried to get a court order
on his bank accounts and the ranch,

1213
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:03,487
DA wouldn't do it.

1214
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:06,156
Toby's got no record.
He's never been arrested.

1215
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:08,450
His only court appearance
was at his divorce.

1216
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,619
He don't fit the bill, Marcus.

1217
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:12,226
People don't start out
robbing banks.

1218
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:14,665
They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.

1219
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:16,291
Besides,
when we was out there,

1220
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,043
we saw two crews from Chevron

1221
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,462
capping wells
and putting in pumpjacks.

1222
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,309
Engineers out there
said they're gonna pull

1223
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,550
2,000 barrels a month
off that place.

1224
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,261
You just try convincing a judge
to issue warrants on somebody

1225
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:29,096
set to clear $50,000 a month

1226
01:28:29,263 --> 01:28:32,349
for robbing $40,000 from the bank
that manages the family trust.

1227
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,560
Midland manages the trust?

1228
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,065
You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.

1229
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,109
I don't think the bank cares
about anything

1230
01:28:42,276 --> 01:28:43,944
but keeping that trust
right where it is.

1231
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:47,447
Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.

1232
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:53,078
Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.

1233
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:55,289
Oh, I hear you.

1234
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:59,209
(SIGHS)

1235
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:00,752
You like my desk?

1236
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:03,213
I don't hate it.

1237
01:29:06,133 --> 01:29:07,426
Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.

1238
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:23,192
(TV PLAYING)

1239
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:45,732
Know who I am?

1240
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,364
I'm the man
who killed your brother.

1241
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:53,657
I know.

1242
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,786
I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.

1243
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,791
Well, you could shoot me now
and be within your rights.

1244
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,961
You toting a gun and all,
how convenient.

1245
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:08,714
I figure you got one, too.

1246
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:16,054
Mind if I sit?

1247
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:21,727
Go ahead.

1248
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:46,501
You want a beer?

1249
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:50,714
Sure.
I ain't on duty no more.

1250
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:02,351
Thanks.

1251
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:10,192
It's nice out here
in this breeze, huh,

1252
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:11,985
now that it's cooled down.

1253
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:23,830
How did you do it?

1254
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,417
Oh, never mind.

1255
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:29,503
I'll figure that out in time.

1256
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,755
Why?
Why did you do it?

1257
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:36,009
I know why your brother,
Tanner, did it.

1258
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:39,012
He robbed them banks
because he liked it.

1259
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:44,726
He shot my partner 300 yards away
'cause he liked it.

1260
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,061
It made him feel good.

1261
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,774
If I hadn't blown
his shit for brains out,

1262
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:54,402
there'd be a new truck out front
with jet skis

1263
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,446
or whatever else
he could think to buy.

1264
01:32:56,613 --> 01:33:00,826
He'd spend it all just to give
an excuse to steal some more.

1265
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,369
But not you.

1266
01:33:04,955 --> 01:33:06,957
There's nothing new
around here...

1267
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,086
except them pumpjacks.

1268
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:12,838
Each one of them
making you a month

1269
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:16,258
what you and your brother stole
from all four banks combined.

1270
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,302
Help me understand, then.

1271
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,349
Help me understand
why four people died...

1272
01:33:26,143 --> 01:33:29,938
so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,

1273
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:32,190
that it don't seem you need.

1274
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:33,441
You got a family?

1275
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,902
My partner had a family.
A big one.

1276
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,905
They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.

1277
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:41,408
- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.

1278
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:44,953
By setting this thing
in motion.

1279
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:49,332
You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?

1280
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:53,587
Oh, no.
This was smart.

1281
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:54,963
This was you.

1282
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:00,635
I've been poor my whole life.

1283
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:06,725
So were my parents,
their parents before them.

1284
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,604
It's like a disease...

1285
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:15,275
passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.

1286
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:16,526
That's what it is.

1287
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:20,030
Infects every person you know...

1288
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:22,699
but not my boys.

1289
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:25,702
Not anymore.

1290
01:34:29,456 --> 01:34:30,749
This is theirs now.

1291
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:37,088
Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,

1292
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:40,258
but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.

1293
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:45,096
See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.

- Howdy.
- What's going on?

1296
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:30,517
The hogs are back
in the garden.

1297
01:35:30,684 --> 01:35:33,144
Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.

Who's this?

1299
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:37,857
I'm an old friend
of your husband.

1300
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,110
Ex-husband.

1301
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,405
I'm just working on the house.

1302
01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:46,241
Oh, you don't live here?

1303
01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:49,202
No, it's not mine.
It's theirs.

1304
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:53,373
Oh.

1305
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,959
The things we do
for our kids, huh?

1306
01:35:58,545 --> 01:35:59,587
Well...

1307
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:02,799
I best be going.

1308

Me, too, Debbie.
I'm gonna wash up,

1310
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,847
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.

1311
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:10,134
Start painting the extension

1312
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:11,575
and then help Randy
with his homework

1313
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:14,477
when he gets back
from school, okay?

1314
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:15,687
Okay.

you're welcome anytime.

I'm ready to be done
with this.

It's gonna haunt me, too.

If you stop by,
maybe I'll give you peace.

1328

Maybe.
Maybe I'll give it to you.
