00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,697

00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,244
        GIVE HIM A 20.

152
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,845
          - OH, UH...

153
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,314
      - IT'S A RETAINER.

154
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,882
          LET ME KNOW
     IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING.

155
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,619
        - [whispering]

159
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,362
        PROVOLONE
     WAS JUST LAYIN' LOW.

160
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,030
- SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
         ABOUT SNAPS?

161
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,666
     - WE'RE GONNA OBSERVE
     THE 11TH COMMANDMENT.

162
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,769
        "DO UNTO OTHERS
BEFORE THEY DO UNTO YOU."

163
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,838
- I FINISHED YOUR NAILS.

164
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:10,175
    IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
        I CAN DO, HUH?

165
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,696
  - WE'D HAVE MORE EXCITEMENT
STAKIN' OUT GRANT'S TOMB.

166
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,732
    - THANK GOD THIS DETAIL
          ENDS TODAY.

167
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,301
 - OOH, TOOMEY'S SORE AS HELL.

168
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,803
    HE'S BEEN ACHIN' TO GET
 SOMETHING ON SNAPS FOR YEARS.

169
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,772
        - SO HE'S SORE.
    WHAT'S HE WANT FROM US?

170
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,741
I MEAN, THE GUY HASN'T SO MUCH

171
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,908
        IN THREE WEEKS.

172
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,777
      [telephone ringing]

173
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,313
         both: TOOMEY.

174
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,616
      I GOT IT LAST TIME.

175
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,122
        - HIYA, TOOMEY.

176
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,857
          - I SUPPOSE

00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,497
      - WELL, LOOK ALIVE

180
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,134
I HEAR HE MAY BE TYIN' UP WITH
THE O'BANION MOB FROM CHICAGO.

181
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,074
 - WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE UP
      THE GHOST, TOOMEY?

182
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,209
    I MEAN, MAYBE THE EGG'S
        GONE STRAIGHT.

183
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,578
- LOOK, I KNOW THIS GUY.

184
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,848
 AND I'M TELLIN' YA, A LEOPARD
DON'T CHANGE HIS STRIPES.

185
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:24,883

00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,885
        - I MEAN SNAPS!

187
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:30,088
NOW, AS SOON AS SOMETHIN'

00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,856
      I DON'T CARE WHAT--

00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,392
            GET IT?
        - GOT IT.

190
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,566

      [doorbell ringing]

192
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,106
- I'M COMIN', I'M COMIN'.

193
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,816
    WELL, WELL, WELL.
 IF IT ISN'T LITTLE ANTHONY...

194
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,285
    AND HIIMPERIAL.

195
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,053
    [vacuum humming]
- I'VE GOTTA SEE MR. PROVOLONE.

196
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,655
            - WHAT?
             HEY!

197
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,324
     SHUT THAT THING OFF!

198
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,697
     - I SAID I GOTTA SEE
MR. PROVOLONE RIGHT AWAY.

199
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:17,035
 - I DON'T REMEMBER SEEIN' YOU
IN MY APPOINTMENT BOOK, ANTHONY.

200
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,570
             NOPE.

201
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,039
NOW, I GOT THE FINUCCI BROTHERS
          AT 9:30...

202
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,274
      DR. POOLE AT 10:30,

203
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,343
FATHER CLEMENTE AT 11:00,
AND THE BANKERS AT NOON.

204
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,712
  BUT I DON'T SEE NO MEETIN'
     WITH HIS ACCOUNTANT!

205
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,881
         - LOOK, ALDO,
  DON'T SCREW AROUND WITH ME.

206
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,483
        THIS IS URGENT.

207
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,918
    - THE BOSS DON'T GET UP
    BEFORE 9:00 A.M.

208
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,887
EVEN THE FEDS KNOW THAT.
     - I'LL TAKE THE HEAT.

209
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,188
    - YOU'LL TAKE THE HEAT?

210
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,490
          I'M THE ONE
    THAT'S GOTTA WAKE HIM.

211
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,893
- TELL HIM IT'S A MATTER
      OF LIFE AND DEATH.

212
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,028
         - OKAY, OKAY.

213
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,264
 BUT HE AIN'T GONNA LIKE THIS.

214
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,002
WAIT IN THE LIVING ROOM.

215
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,873
        HOW DO YOU LIKE
    THE CRUST ON THAT MUG?

216
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,741
          THROWS OFF
      MY WHOLE ITINERARY.

217
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,919
         - [laughing]

218
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,654
      WHERE DO YOU THINK
         YOU'RE GOIN'?

219
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,022
      - I GOTTA WAKE HIM.

220
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,624
     - HE DOESN'T WANNA BE
          DISRUPTED.

221
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,626
HE NEEDS HIS BEAUTY SLEEP
      FOR THOSE BANKERS.

222
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,395
        - IT'S URGENT.
    KEEP ME COVERED.

223
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,310
    - THIS BETTER BE GOOD.
     - I WARNED HIM, BOSS.

224
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,512
- ANTHONY TOLD ME IT WAS
     LIFE AND DEATH, BOSS.

225
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,084
- YOU MUGS STOP CALLIN' ME BOSS.
     IT AIN'T RESCTABLE!

226
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,220
      both: SORRY, BOSS.

227
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,161
    - WELL, LITTLE ANTHONY,

228
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,729
PROBATION AND WALL STREET
    LAY ANOTHER EGG--WHAT?

229
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,433
  - CAN I TALK TO YOU ALONE,
        MR. PROVOLONE?

230
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,268
        - WE ARE ALONE.

231
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,570
    ALDO, BREAKFAST.
     - HALF A GRAPEFRUIT?

232
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,138
         - SECTIONED,
 NIX THE CHERRY IN THE MIDDLE.

233
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,372
        - FRENCH TOAST?
        - LIGHT BROWN.

234
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,640
        - BACON?
        - TRIM THE FAT.

235
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,808
        - COFFEE?
          - NO CREAM.

236
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,210
         - TWO LUMPS?
     - [snaps fingers] GO.

237
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,045
     - ON ITS WAY, SNAPS.
- UH, IT'S "MR. PROVOLONE" NOW.

238
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,713
    AND IF YOU CALL ME THAT
IN FRONT OF THE BANKERS,

239
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,748
YOU'RE GONNA GUM UP THE WORKS.
     - YES, MR. PROVOLONE.

240
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:14,018
 - AND I'LL EAT IN THE YARD--
        I MEAN ATRIUM.

241
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,821
     - YES, MR. PROVOLONE.
WHATEVER YOU SAY, MR. PROVOLONE.

242
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,191
        - YOU KNOW WHAT
"ATRIUM" MEANS, ANTHONY?

243
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,194
          - NO, SIR.

244
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,764
  - IT'S A COURTYARD OFTTIMES
    SURROUNDED BY COLUMNS.

245
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,634
    - THANK YOU, SIR.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, SIR.

246
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,905
      - PARK IT, ANTHONY.

247
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,240
            I LEARN
     A NEW WORD EVERY DAY.

248
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,942
    YOU SHOULD EXPAND
YOUR VOCABULARY, ANTHONY,

249
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,611
    AND YOU WOULDN'T
     JUST BE A BOOKKEEPER.

250
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,146
      - ACCOUNTANT, SIR.

251
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,383

00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,752

 "TO BE EFFICIENT AND SPEEDY."

254
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,190
      ALL RIGHT, ANTHONY,
     LET'S BE EXPEDITIOUS.

255
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,791
      WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
    YOU GOT ME UP AT 8:00?

256
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,662
    - WELL, MR. PROVOLONE,
     WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

257
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,099
     I'VE COME TO ASK YOU
         FOR A RAISE.

258
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,867
         - [chuckles]

259
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,836
    MAYBE MY HEARING
     AIN'T 20/20 NO MORE.

260
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,472
WHAT DID HE JUST ASK ME?
  - HE ASKED YOU FOR A RAISE.

261
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,773
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

262
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:09,807
        ARE YOU CRAZY?

263
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,476
     - WHEN YOU HEAR WHY--

264
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,977
         - YOU BELIEVE
    THIS GUY'S MOXIE?

265
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,412
  - HE'S GOT CHUTZPAH, BOSS.
     - DON'T CALL ME BOSS.

266
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,747
        - SORRY, BOSS.

267
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,248
     - I KNOW THIS WASN'T
      THE BEST DAY, SIR.

268
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,650
     - YOU'RE TELLING ME?

269
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,718
IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL TODAY--
    - KNOCK ON WOOD.

270
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,922
- I'LL BE A BOARD OF DIRECTOR.
        - I KNOW THAT.

271
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,556
      AND--AND I WOULDN'T
          BOTHER YOU,

272
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,459
     BUT LOVE MAKES US DO
        STRANGE THINGS.

273
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,863
    - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO
    WITH THE PRICE OF BEER?

274
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,165
- BREAKFAST IS "SOIVED."

275
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,135
- "SERVED," YOU PALOOKA.

276
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,104
I'M SIGNING YOU UP FOR ELOCUTION
    LESSONS WITH DR. POOLE.

277
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,507
    IF I GOTTA DO IT,

278
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,777
      - ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,949
         - YEAH, YEAH.

282
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,584
I WANNA SIT ON MY ATRIUM.

283
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,722
    NOT BAD FOR A KID
        FROM THE SLUMS.

284
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,892
  MY WIFE PICKS ALL THIS OUT.
    SHE'S GOT AN EYE.

285
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,360
        [snaps fingers]

286
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,263
      SO WHO IS THE DAME
THAT'S GOT ME UP AT 8:43?

287
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,699
    - EXCUSE ME, SIR?

288
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,269
 - YOU SAID YOU WERE IN LOVE.
     I ASSUME IT'S A DAME.

289
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,939
 - OH, SHE'S A WONDERFUL GIRL
 FROM A FINE, WEALTHY FAMILY.

290
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,607
 AND I'M GONNA PROPOSE TO HER
         THIS MORNING.

291
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,877
    - AH, AIN'T LOVE GRAND?

292
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,312
  WELL, YOU GOT MY BLESSING.

293
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,615
    CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU
      AND YOUR NEW BRIDE.

294
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,084
- BUT I CAN'T MARRY HER,

295
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,552
NOT UNLESS I CAN GIVE HER
    THE KIND OF LIFE

296
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,920
     THAT HER PARENTS DID.

297
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,823
    - WELL, DUMP HER.
SHE SOUNDS LIKE A GOLD DIGGER.

298
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,325
      - OH, NO, NO, SIR.
SHE'S JUST THE OPPOSITE--

299
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,828
     VERY KIND AND SWEET,
        DOWN-TO-EARTH.

300
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,130
    - WELL, I CAN SEE
      THIS DAME'S GOT YOU

301
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,066
        WRAPPED AROUND
    HER LITTLE FINGER, HUH?

302
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,102
  OKAY, HOW MUCH YOU MAKIN'?

303
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,004
        - 400 A MONTH.

304
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,271
     - HOW MUCH YOU WANNA
         TO BE MAKIN'?

305
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,874
    - 1,400 A MONTH.

306
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,747
  YOU CAN TAKE A FEW MINUTES
    TO THINK IT OVER.

307
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,249
- I HAVE THOUGHT IT OVER.

308
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,084
  GET THE HELL OFF MY ATRIUM!

309
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,153
        IF BIG ANTHONY
  WERE ALIVE TO HEAR THIS...

310
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,157
 - ON THE GRAVE OF MY FATHER,
 I NEVER WANTED TO UPSET YOU.

311
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,359
     BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA
        HOW TOUGH IT IS

312
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,728
     FOR TWO YOUNG PEOPLE
  STARTING OUT THESE DAYS...

313
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,731
  AS I WAS SAYING LAST NIGHT
    TO MR. LIPINSKY.

314
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,700
          - LIPINSKY?

315
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,635
            - YES.
      MR. MYRON LIPINSKY.

316
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,370
- LUCKY LIPINSKY THE GANGSTER?

317
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,639
     HOW CAN YOU ASSOCIATE
     WITH SUCH A LOWLIFE?

318
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,207
        - HE'S LOOKING
     FOR A NEW ACCOUNTANT.

319
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,509
    HIS LAST ONE DIED
         IN HIS SLEEP.

320
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,444
- OH, YOU DON'T THINK THAT BUM
        WOULD SHOOT HIM

321
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,112
  WHILE HE WAS AWAKE, DO YOU?
        THE CHEAP HOOD.

322
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,747
  - HE'S NOT THAT CHEAP, SIR.

323
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,484
    MR. LIPINSKY IS WILLING
 TO PAY ME THE 1,400 A MONTH.

324
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,820
  - OH, BACKSTABBING WEASEL.

325
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,524
HE'D LOVE TO GET HIS MEAT HOOKS
     INTO ONE OF MY BOYS.

326
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,827
    ALL RIGHT, I'LL PAY...

327
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,062
            1,200.

328
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,330
     - OH, MR. PROVOLONE,

329
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,299
         I AM TOUCHED
     BY YOUR FAITH IN ME.

330
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,134
 - I SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS MUG
        IN COLLECTIONS.

331
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,403
    HE'S NOT AN ACCOUNTANT.
HE'S A SHAKEDOWN ARTIST.

332
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,272
      - NOW, I CAN COUNT
    ON THIS 1,200 A MONTH?

333
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,307
      - YEAH, YOU GOT IT.
              GO.

334
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,976
          GO PROPOSE.

335
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,784
    - MR. PROVOLONE,
        IT IS MY HONOR

336
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,053
TO ASK FOR YOUR DAUGHTER'S HAND
         IN MATRIMONY.

337
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,588
        - [spits]

338
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,623
          PARDON ME?

339
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,991
            - YES.

340
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,728
         YOUR DAUGHTER
      IS THE ONE I LOVE.

341
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,198
        - MY DAUGHTER?

342
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,200
 HOW DO YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER?

343
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,935
          - [choking]
      WE MET AT CLUB 33.

344
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,203
    - IN A SPEAKEASY?

345
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,772
- IT'S A VERY RESPECTABLE
          SPEAKEASY.

346
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440
- COULDN'T EVEN PICK ONE
     THAT BOUGHT MY BEER!

347
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,242
         - BOSS, BOSS,
    GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF.

348
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,079
LET ME TAKE CARE OF HIM.

349
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,315
- ARE YOU STILL PACKIN'?

350
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,317
         FORK IT OVER.

351
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,120
             FORK!

352
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,455
        WE'RE NOT
IN THAT BUSINESS ANYMORE.

353
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,657
        AT NOON,
      WE BECOME BANKERS.

354
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,960
      - CAN I GET UP NOW,
        MR. PROVOLONE?

355
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,332
          [coughing]

356
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,373
- SORRY I LOST MY TEMPER.

357
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,041
    - [normal voice]
          NO PROBLEM.

358
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,079
             IT IS
  WITH THE GREATEST HUMILITY

359
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,847
      THAT I ASK TO MARRY
        YOUR DAUGHTER.

360
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,650
  - ON A LOUSY 1,200 A MONTH?
     SHE DESERVES BETTER!

361
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,620
 - YES, SHE DESERVES A HUSBAND
    WHO MAKES 1,400.

362
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,157
    - SHE'LL GET ONE,
     AND IT WON'T BE YOU.

363
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,161
        [belches]

364
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,463
            CONNIE,
     BRING ME A BRIOSCHI.

365
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,099
     - THAT'S ALDO'S JOB.
- WELL, THEN GET ALDO TO DO IT.

366
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,535
         - YES, BOSS.
     - DON'T CALL ME BOSS.

367
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,569
        - SORRY, BOSS.

368
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,671
    - AND AS FOR YOU,

369
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,374
  YOU THINK I'M GONNA LET YOU
MARRY MY DAUGHTER FOR HER MONEY?

370
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,278
    - OH, MR. PROVOLONE...

371
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,647
  I DON'T LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER
        FOR HER MONEY,

372
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,881
      AND I CAN PROVE IT.

373
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,283
            - YEAH?
             HOW?

374
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,617
      - WHEN I MARRY HER,

375
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,519
      I PLAN TO GIVE HER
      MY ENTIRE FORTUNE.

376
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,322
- HOW MUCH CAN A GOOMBAH
        LIKE YOU HAVE?

377
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,058
         - $48,642.30.

378
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,129
  - HOW DID YOU SAVE 50 GRAND
        ON 400 A MONTH?

379
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,198
    - I STOLE IT FROM YOU.

380
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,600
          - YOU WHAT?

381
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,901
    YOU WALK INTO MY HOUSE

382
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,304
          AND TELL ME
YOU STOLE 50 Gs FROM ME?

383
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,372
         - THIS GINK!

384
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,775
  YOU WANT I SHOULD BUMP HIM?

385
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,914
- GIVE ME THAT GAT, ALDO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I TOLD YOU.

386
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,284
     YOU'RE A BUTLER NOW.

387
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,652
        "BUTTLE"!

388
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,354
     - THAT PIECE HAS BEEN
IN THE FAMILY FOR YEARS!

389
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,890
    - QUIT SQUAWKIN'.

390
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,559
    NOW, I'M WAITIN'
      FOR AN EXPLANATION.

391
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,860
    - MAYBE I SHOULD START
      FROM THE BEGINNING.

392
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,796
         - JUST START
FROM WHERE YOU STOLE MY MONEY.

393
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,598
- WHEN I FIRST TOOK OVER
      AS YOUR ACCOUNTANT,

394
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,833
    YOUR BOOKS WERE A MESS.

395
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,868
    - THEY DON'T SOUND LIKE
THEY'RE IN NO GREAT SHAPE NOW.

396
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,337
        DAMN IT.
    DOUBLE NEGATIVE.

397
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,306
- YOUR OVERHEAD WAS HIGH,
AND YOUR NET PROFITS WERE LOW.

398
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,542
      I CHANGED ALL THAT.

399
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,411
- AND I SENT YOU A FRUIT BASKET
FOR CHRISTMAS, DIDN'T I?

400
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,981
- I TOOK ALL THE PROFITS
 FROM YOUR PROTECTION RACKETS

401
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:54,218
AND USED THEM TO UPGRADE
  YOUR BOOTLEGGING OPERATION.

402
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,620
     NOW, THAT ALLOWED ME
    TO CUT THE COSTS

403
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,188
         ON YOUR BEER
    A DIME A BOTTLE.

404
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,190
- SURE, YOU WERE FATTENING ME UP
         FOR THE KILL.

405
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,125
    - THEN A STRANGE THING
        HAPPENED.

406
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,727
            I MADE
A SLIGHT CLERICAL ERROR.

407
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,929
      - WAS THAT THE ONE
     THAT COST ME $50,000?

408
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,099
- DON'T GET AHEAD OF THE STORY.
      - WELL, EXCUSE ME!

409
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,568
- IT WAS A SIMPLE MISTAKE
         IN ADDITION.

410
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,304
 ON THE BOOKS, I ACCIDENTALLY
LOWERED YOUR COSTS BY A NICKEL

411
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,939
      INSTEAD OF A DIME.

412
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,807
     NOW, WHEN I REALIZED
          MY MISTAKE,

413
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,975
        I WENT TO SPEAK
    TO YOU ABOUT IT.

414
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,677
- I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

415
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,512
    - YOU WERE IN CHICAGO.

416
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,214
  IT WAS ST. VALENTINE'S DAY.

417
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,384
          - OH, YEAH.
          [laughing]

418
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,386
         - [laughing]

419
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,821
        - ZIP IT.

420
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,724
      - I REMEMBER IT WAS
      ST. VALENTINE'S DAY

421
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,893
    BECAUSE THAT'S THE DAY
     I MET YOUR DAUGHTER.

422
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,196
  - IN VENDETTI'S SPEAKEASY.
        I'LL KILL HER.

423
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,399
         - IT WAS LOVE
        AT FIRST SIGHT.

424
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,601
AND THAT'S WHEN I TURNED
    THAT 5-CENT ERROR

425
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,536
 INTO THE KEY TO MY HAPPINESS.

426
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,673
     I HID IT ON THE BOOKS
AND BEEFED UP PETTY CASH.

427
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,076
AND I KNEW THAT A BIG MAN
     LIKE ANGELO PROVOLONE

428
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,779
 WOULDN'T BEGRUDGE HIS FUTURE
     SON-IN-LAW A NICKEL,

429
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,181
     WHICH I PLAN TO GIVE
TO YOUR DAUGHTER ANYWAY.

430
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,483
 - OH, THIS GUY IS BEAUTIFUL.

431
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,385
 HE FLATTERS YOU TO YOUR FACE

432
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,888
    WHILE HE STICKS A KNIFE
         IN YOUR BACK.

433
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,457
    - I'M NOT PROUD OF WHAT
I'VE DONE, MR. PROVOLONE.

434
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,592
         BUT I'D DO IT
        ALL OVER AGAIN

435
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,163
          TO CAPTURE
    YOUR DAUGHTER'S HEART.

436
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,731
     - YOU REALLY LOVE HER
        THAT MUCH, HUH?

437

00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,822
        - DRASTIC TIMES
  CALL FOR DRASTIC MEASURES,

585
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,625
    WHICH BRINGS ME TO OUR
  PRESENT MEETING, GENTLEMEN.

586
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,761
        - PLEASE.
          MY STOMACH.

587
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,462
    - WHITNEY, I WISH YOU'D
 BE A LITTLE MORE RECEPTIVE--

588
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,998
 - ARE WE IN SUCH DIRE STRAITS

589
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:31,301
     THAT WE WANT THE NAME
ANGELO "SNAPS" PROVOLONE

590
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,569
      ON OUR LETTERHEAD?

591
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,072
      - HIS NAME WON'T BE
      ON OUR LETTERHEAD.

592
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,474
         BUT HIS MONEY
    WILL BE IN OUR VAULTS.

593
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,343
    - BUT, GENTLEMEN,

594
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,045
         BRINGING A...
    GANGSTER ON THE BOARD?

595
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,581
    - EX-GANGSTER...

596
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:49,319
OR AS I PREFER TO THINK OF HIM,
    A ROBBER BARON...

597
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,455
    LIKE J.P. MORGAN
    OR JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER.

598
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:56,360
  - AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T HAVE
A MIDDLE NAME IN QUOTES.

599
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,163
        - LET ME HANDLE
        MR. PROVOLONE.

600
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,532
  - WELL, I MAY HAVE TO TAKE
THIS GREASEBALL'S MONEY,

601
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,234
 BUT I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT.

602
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:09,640
    - [sniffling] OH, NORA,
    I HAVE SO MANY DREAMS.

603
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,242
  I WANNA RIDE ON A ZEPPELIN,

604
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,645
  ATTEND A RUDY VALLEE SHOW.

605
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:18,749
  I WANNA GO TO AN OPIUM TENT
         IN CHINATOWN.

606
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,185
    - YOU'LL BE DOIN'
    ALL THESE THINGS, LISA.

607
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,853
             - NO!
         - YOU'LL SEE.

608
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,155
      - MY LIFE IS OVER.
     MARRYING MY BOYFRIEND

609
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,691
      WAS MY LAST CHANCE
  TO GET OUT OF THIS PRISON.

610
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,427
    - WELL, AS PRISONS GO,

611
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,896
    IT'S NOT SO BAD.

612
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,432
          YOU KNOW...

613
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,168
I WENT TO THIS PLAY ONCE.

614
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,637
     - YOU WENT TO A PLAY?
      WHAT DID YOU WEAR?

615
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,772
         - NEVER MIND.

616
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,140
    THERE WAS A SCENE
         WHERE A GIRL

617
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,143
    MADE HER PARENTS THINK
    SHE WAS PREGNANT,

618
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:51,048
AND THEY WERE FORCED TO LET HER
     MARRY HER BOYFRIEND.

619
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,117
     - BUT IF I TOLD DADDY
        I WAS PREGNANT,

620
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,087
         HE'D KILL ME.

621
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:00,958
         - EITHER WAY,
 YOU'D GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

622
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:10,133
- I GIVE YOU A NICE BANKER TIE
  TO GO WITH THE BANKER SUIT.

623
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,035
        PICK ONE.

624
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,138
    - TOO LOUD, TOO QUIET,
TOO STRIPED, TOO PLAID...

625
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,141
        [snaps fingers]
            BINGO.

626
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,610
    - MR. PROVOLONE!

627
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,245
         - WHAT IS IT?

628
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,213
    I'M IN THE MIDDLE
      OF A FITTIN' HERE.

629
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,782
    - MR. PROVOLONE,
YOUR DAUGHTER WANTS TO SEE YA.

630
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,084
        - WHAT, AGAIN?

631
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,186
- SHE SAYS IT'S A MATTER
      OF LIFE AND DEATH.

632
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,091
    - NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT?

633
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,227
    - DADDY, DEAR...

634
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,829
    THERE'S SOMETHING
      I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU

635
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,833
     THAT'S GONNA GIVE YOU
        QUITE A SHOCK.

636
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,903
        DADDY...

637
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,939
    I'VE DECIDED TO GO AWAY
         TO A CONVENT.

638
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,774
- NOW YOU WANNA BE A NUN.

639
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,143
  WELL, YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE.

640
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,711
         - NO, DADDY.

641
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:59,182
 CONVENTS ARE ALSO WHERE UNWED
MOTHERS GO TO HAVE THEIR BABIES.

642
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,252
            - WHAT?

643
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,222
    - YOU ALL RIGHT, BOSS?

644
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,258
  - I THOUGHT I TOOK THIS ROD
        AWAY FROM YOU.

645
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,928
    - IT'S MY SPARE,
    FOR EMERGENCIES.

646
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,829
    - [snaps fingers]
        GIVE IT TO ME.

647
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,073
          EVERYTHING.

648
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,326
        [ticking]

649
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,632
          IS THAT IT?

650
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,638
 IT'S LIKE DISARMING GERMANY.

651
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,608
     NOW, GET OUTTA HERE!

652
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,348
  I SHOULD USE THIS ON MYSELF

653
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,984
 AFTER WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME
    AND YOUR MOTHER.

654
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,755
    THE SHAME OF IT!
      - I'M SORRY, DADDY.

655
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,491
      I'LL START PACKING
     TO GO TO THE CONVENT.

656
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,859
         - YOU'RE NOT
     GOING TO ANY CONVENT!

657
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,293
  YOU'RE GONNA MARRY THIS BUM

658
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,029
         JUST AS SOON
AS I GET MY HANDS ON HIM.

659
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:55,232
         - OH, DADDY,
    YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND!

660
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,535
- WHAT CHOICE HAVE I GOT,
          YOU TRAMP?

661
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,803
    AND AFTER THE WEDDING,

662
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:04,374
    YOU'LL MOVE INTO A NICE
    GROUND-FLOOR APARTMENT.

663
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,543
     - WHY A GROUND-FLOOR
          APARTMENT?

664
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,311
        - 'CAUSE AFTER
    I BREAK HIS LEGS,

665
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,214
    HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT
         UP ANY STEPS.

666
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,888
        - INTERESTING.

667
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,222
    - THERE'S A DAME
         AT THE DOOR.

668
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,258
- CAN'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY?
        BRUSH HER OFF.

669
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,726
          - I CAN'T.
          - WHY NOT?

670
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,761
- BECAUSE THE DAME SAYS--
        - I KNOW.

671
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,463
     IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE
          AND DEATH.

672
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,332
      [speaking Italian]

673
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,505
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, MISS...
          - THERESA.

674
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,374
          - THERESA.

675
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,042
- CAN WE SPEAK PRIVATELY?
         - YEAH, SURE.

676
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,711
     WHY DON'T YOU COME UP
         TO MY OFFICE?

677
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,051
  IF DEMPSEY GOT THE WORKOUT
         I'M GETTING,

678
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,920
     HE WOULDN'T HAVE LOST
        HIS LAST FIGHT.

679
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,389
    [Connie laughing]

680
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:06,503
    - MR. PROVOLONE,
I'VE DONE A STUPID THING.

681
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,737
        - WHAT'S THAT?

682
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,039
     - I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE
          WITH A MAN

683
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,174
    NAMED ANTHONY ROSSANO.

684
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,976
        - YOU'RE RIGHT,
    THAT'S A STUPID THING.

685
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,544
HE'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR.

686
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,413
        - BY WHO?

687
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,915
        - BY ME.
      - WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

688
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,219
     - ANTHONY JUST ASKED
     TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER.

689
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,421
    - HE WAS HERE ALREADY?
- YES. BUT YOU'RE YOUNG.

690
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,356
     DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
      YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE.

691
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,492
        THE BREAD LINES
ARE FULL OF ELIGIBLE YOUNG MEN.

692
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,926
  NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

693
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,862
  - NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
        MR. PROVOLONE.

694
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:35,665
      I LIED TO ANTHONY.

695
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,767
          I TOLD HIM
THAT I WAS YOUR DAUGHTER.

696
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,302
        - YOU DID WHAT?

697
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,771
          - HE THINKS
    YOU'RE MY FATHER.

698
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,673
  SO, YOU SEE, WHEN HE ASKED
FOR PERMISSION TO MARRY,

699
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,008
     IT WAS ME HE WANTED.

700
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,144
  - THAT MEANS HE NEVER EVEN
    MET MY DAUGHTER.

701
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,379
    THAT'S WONDERFUL!

702
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,747
        NO, WAIT.
    THAT'S TERRIBLE.

703
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,783
     IF HE NEVER MET HER,
    THEN WHO'S THE FATHER?

704
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,620
  LISTEN, OF ALL THE GUYS IN
THE WORLD, WHY DID YOU PICK ME?

705
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,288
      - BECAUSE I WANTED
    ANTHONY TO THINK

706
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,457
          THAT I CAME
    FROM A WEALTHY FAMILY.

707
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,792
          AFTER ALL,
    HE MAKES 1,400 A MONTH.

708
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,028
     - IT'S 1,200 A MONTH!

709
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,530
- WHEN HE ASKED MY NAME,

710
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,732
 I HAD JUST SEEN YOUR PICTURE
      IN THE <i>DAILY NEWS.</i>

711
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,934
         SO I TOLD HIM
I WAS THERESA PROVOLONE.

712
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,135
      - THAT MAKES SENSE.

713
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,304
      - I DIDN'T FIND OUT
          UNTIL LATER

714
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,640
THAT YOU WERE A GANGST--

715
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,042
            I MEAN,
  THAT YOU WERE WHO YOU WERE.

716
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,011
     - THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
      TELL HIM THE TRUTH?

717
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,480
  - BECAUSE HE LIKED THE IDEA
THAT I WAS YOUR DAUGHTER.

718
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,649
    I JUST FOUND OUT
    THAT HE WORKED FOR YOU.

719
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,717
- IT'S MORE LIKE HE WORKS
         FOR HIMSELF.

720
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,486
 - SO YOU SEE, MR. PROVOLONE,

721
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,689
I DON'T WANT ANTHONY TO FIND OUT
  THE TRUTH FROM ANYONE ELSE.

722
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,324
      - YEAH, IF HE DOES,
     I'M OUT 50,000 CLAMS.

723
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,292
     THINK, THINK, THINK.
      [snapping fingers]

724
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,660
     ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT!

725
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,229
     NOW, I WON'T TELL HIM
    YOU'RE NOT MY DAUGHTER,

726
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,764
    BUT YOU GOTTA DO
    SOMETHING FOR ME.

727
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,532
        - OH, ANYTHING,
        MR. PROVOLONE.

728
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,534
    - DON'T LEAVE THIS ROOM

729
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,537
 UNTIL I SETTLE A SMALL MATTER
    WITH MR. ROSSANO.

730
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,573
    - I'LL WAIT RIGHT HERE.
          I PROMISE.

731
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,911
    - CONNIE, KEEP YOUR EYE
         ON MY OFFICE

732
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,147
AND MAKE SURE MY DAUGHTER
    DON'T GO NOWHERE, HUH?

733
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,515
- HOW'D SHE GET IN THERE?

734
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,550
 I'VE BEEN WATCHIN' THIS DOOR
        THE WHOLE TIME.

735
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,553
          - NOT LISA.
        THERESA!

736
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,422
- YOU GOT TWO DAUGHTERS?

737
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,190
  - ALL RIGHT, IN THE THIRD,

738
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,593
  I WANT $40 ACROSS THE BOARD
         ON HIGH HAT.

739
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,795
         THAT'S RIGHT,
     $40 WORTH OF PARSLEY.

740
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,397
  WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE LOW
          ON GARNISH.

741
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,267
- ALDO, THAT KID ANTHONY?
          - HE LEFT.

742
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,902
    - I KNOW HE LEFT.
      GET HIM BACK HERE.

743
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,604
 HE SAID HE WAS TAKIN' A WALK
    AROUND THE BLOCK.

744
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,939
          - I CAN'T.
     I'M SMOKIN' A SALMON.

745
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:27,043
  - PUT IT OUT, GET ANTHONY,
  AND STASH HIM SOMEWHERE...

746
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,813
     BUT NOT IN MY OFFICE.

747
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,581
     - LOOK AT YOU, SNAPS.

748
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,950
ONE DAY OF BEIN' HONEST,
AND YOU'RE FALLIN' APART.

749
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,020
FORGET ABOUT THE PROMISE
    TO YOUR OLD MAN.

750
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,856
- A PROMISE IS A PROMISE.

751
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,766
    - MR. PROVOLONE!

752
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,469
    CAN I SPEAK TO YA NOW?

753
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,038
          - NOT NOW!

754
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,608
        FINUCCIS!

755
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,347
        - ANGELO!

756
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,416
        - AS YOU WERE.

757
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,457
        - ANGELO!

758
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,395
        - SOFIA, HONEY.

759
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,830
    YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
I'VE WANTED TO SEE TODAY.

760
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,632
             <i>BELLA.</i>

761
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,969
- THIS IS THE LAST TIME,
ABSOLUTELY THE LAST TIME

762
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,104
    I DRIVE WITH THAT
CRAZY CHAUFFEUR OF YOURS!

763
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,339
    - JOHNNY ELBOWS?

764
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,607
  - HE DROPPED ME OFF AT MASS

765
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,442
     AND STAYED OUT FRONT
    WITH THE MOTOR RUNNING!

766
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,177
 - AH, IT'S A FORCE OF HABIT.

767
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,213
- YOU HAD TO FIRE OSCAR!
HE WAS A REAL CHAUFFEUR!

768
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,615
     - FORGET ABOUT OSCAR.

769
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,250
 WE GOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
        TO TALK ABOUT.

770
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,584
     - WHAT'S THE MATTER?

771
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:46,022
JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH!

772
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,491
        MY BABY!

773
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,564
        MY LITTLE BABY.

774
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,232
        [Lisa sobbing]

775
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,535
  - YOUR FATHER JUST TOLD ME.

776
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:02,339
            - MAMA.
    I'M SORRY, MAMA.

777
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,241
  - OH, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

778
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,012
    - IT'S HIS FAULT!

779
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,747
          - MY FAULT?

780
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,650
            - YES!
      YOU SUFFOCATED HER!

781
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:17,287
- YOU KEPT ME PRISONER UP HERE
        LIKE RAPUNZEL!

782
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,222
     - WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
    AIN'T SNOW WHITE!

783
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,725
     - LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE
          YOU'VE SET.

784
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,361
 FILLING THE HOUSE WITH THUGS,
      GOONS, AND HIT MEN!

785
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,695
 - ALL RIGHT, WELL, SOMETIMES

786
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,465
        I HAD TO BRING
     MY WORK HOME WITH ME.

787
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,601
 - WHO DID THIS THING TO YOU?
          TELL MAMA.

788
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:35,171
        - DADDY KNOWS.
 HE MET WITH HIM THIS MORNING.

789
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,208
      - WELL, WHO IS IT?

790
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:43,113
     - BETTER YOU HEAR IT
FROM YOUR OWN DAUGHTER'S LIPS.

791
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,881
         - IT'S OSCAR.

792
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,082
             both:
        THE CHAUFFEUR!

793
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,350
    [car horn blows]

794
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,652
- WHY YOU ACTIN' SO SURPRISED?
        YOU KNEW.

795
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,321
      - OF COURSE I KNEW!

796
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,989
      I JUST HAD NO IDEA.
    [doorbell rings]

797
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,257
        BE RIGHT BACK.

798
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,529
    - THERE YOU ARE.

799
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,831
         I FOUND HIM.

800
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,033
    - [snaps fingers]
        WE GOTTA TALK.

801
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,741
  - ANGELO, WE'VE GOTTA TALK.

802
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,710
    OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
        YOU WERE BUSY.

803
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,712
 - YOU MUST BE MRS. PROVOLONE.
        WHAT AN HONOR.

804
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,381
- SOFIA, LITTLE ANTHONY,
        MY ACCOUNTANT.

805
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,783
- AND FUTURE SON-IN-LAW.

806
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,218
  I'VE JUST ASKED PERMISSION
    TO MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER.

807
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,521
             LISA?

808
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,256
     - NO, DEAR, NOT LISA,

809
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,324
        THE OTHER ONE.

810
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,793
    - WHAT OTHER ONE?

811
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,528
          - YOU KNOW,
        THE OTHER ONE.

812
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,264
THE OTHER ONE THAT'S NOT LISA.

813
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,600
    WHY DON'T YOU GO CHECK
      ON THE GIRLS, DEAR?

814
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,940
        - I DIDN'T KNOW
    YOU HAD TWO DAUGHTERS.

815
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,376
      - YEAH, THIS HOUSE
  IS FULL OF SURPRISES TODAY.

816
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,746
  LOOK, ANTHONY, I DON'T KNOW
        IF YOU NOTICED,

817
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,081
          BUT MY WIFE
WAS A LITTLE COOL TO YOU.

818
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,651
        - I DID NOTICE.
IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG?

819
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,486
      - YEAH, SHE THINKS
YOU'RE A FORTUNE HUNTER.

820
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:57,887
        - OH, NO!

821
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,990
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER
        FROM THE TRUTH!

822
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,326
 HOW CAN I CONVINCE YOUR WIFE
    OF MY GOOD INTENTIONS?

823
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,763
    - EASY. YOU KNOW
THAT 50 Gs YOU CHISELED FROM ME?

824
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,798
  - AND PLAN TO GIVE TO YOUR
 DAUGHTER AFTER WE'RE MARRIED.

825
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,434
    - WELL, GIVE IT TO HER
    BEFORE YOU'RE MARRIED.

826
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,436
        [snaps fingers]
      WRITE OUT A CHECK.

827
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:14,804
  THAT WAY, MY WIFE WILL KNOW

828
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,474
YOU'RE NOT MARRYING LISA
      JUST FOR HER MONEY.

829
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,775
          - THERESA.
         - YEAH, YEAH.

830
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,910
      I'M ALWAYS GETTIN'
THESE TWO KIDS MIXED UP.

831
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,080
        HERE, SIT DOWN.

832
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,548
  - THERE'S A LITTLE PROBLEM.

833
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,983
        - NO INK?

834
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,953
        - I DIDN'T WANT
  TO PUT THE MONEY IN A BANK.

835
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,789
  YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF SHAPE
    THEY'RE IN THESE DAYS.

836
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,824
        I CONVERTED IT
     TO PRECIOUS STONES--

837
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,459
      DIAMONDS, EMERALDS,
      THAT KIND OF THING.

838
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,894
     - THAT'S THE PERFECT
         WEDDING GIFT.

839
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,696
      YOU KNOW HOW WOMEN
         LOVE JEWELS.

840
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,865
  - I'LL GO GET IT RIGHT NOW.

841
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,566
    - ANTHONY, IF YOU WANT,

842
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,134
  I COULD HAVE ONE OF MY BOYS
          ESCORT YOU.

843
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,736
          AFTER ALL,
     THAT'S A LOT OF ICE.

844
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,405
  - OH, NO, NO, DON'T BOTHER.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, DAD.

845
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:53,309
    - I'LL BE WAITIN', SON.

846
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,945
  YOU MISERABLE LITTLE PUNK.

847
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,060
             ALDO,
    WHERE'S THAT CHAUFFEUR?

848
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,862
        - JOHNNY'S OUT
    WAXIN' THE CADDY.

849
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,430
        - NOT THAT LUG,
     THE OTHER ONE--OSCAR.

850
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,599
    - YOU FIRED HIM.

851
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,202
     - I KNOW I FIRED HIM.
      WHERE DOES HE LIVE?

852
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,037
      - HOW SHOULD I KNOW
      WHERE OSCAR LIVES?

853
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,906
- I KNOW WHERE HE LIVES.
        - YEAH? WHERE?

854
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,407
         - SOUTH SIDE.
         - ALL RIGHT.

855
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,743
YOU TAKE A RIDE OUT THERE
WITH JOHNNY ELBOWS AND GRAB HIM!

856
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,978
  - ONLY HE DON'T LIVE THERE
        NO MORE.

857
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,180
- WHERE DOES HE LIVE NOW?

858
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,782
     - HE JOINED THE ARMY
     FOR A SIX-YEAR HITCH,

859
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,350
 AND THEY SHIPPED HIM ABROAD.

860
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,019
- IT SEEMS HE WAS IN LOVE
    WITH SOME SKIRT,

861
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,587
      NEVER TOLD US WHO,

862
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,022
    BUT THEY BROKE UP
      BECAUSE HER FATHER

863
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:42,258
  WAS A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS.
    - OH, IS THAT SO?

864
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,360
          - OH, YEAH.
AS MUCH AS HE LOVED HER,

865
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,796
    HE COULDN'T BEAR HAVIN'
THIS CREEP AS A FATHER-IN-LAW.

866
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,499
- DON'T YOU EVER SHUT UP?

867
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,338
        - WHAT'D I SAY?

868
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,445
 - I HAVE GOT TO TALK TO YOU,
        MR. PROVOLONE.

869
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:03,713
        - LATER!

870
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,081
    - MR. PROVOLONE,

871
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,116
        I'M LEAVIN' YOU
TO GO TO THE UNDERWOODS.

872
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,551
         - UNDERWOODS!

873
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,588
     YOU'RE GOIN' TO WORK
          FOR BRUCE?

874
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,489
     - I'M MARRYIN' BRUCE.

875
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,625
- YOU'RE MARRYIN' BRUCE?
      I FOUND HIM FIRST!

876
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,560
    I MEAN FOR MY DAUGHTER.

877
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,930
    - WE MET THE DAY
      HE CALLED ON LISA.

878
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:24,033
             OH...
  IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

879
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,835
      - CONGRATULATIONS.

880
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,404

      FROM A WINDOW LEDGE
AT THE EDISON HOTEL AT THE TIME.

963
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,242
     - THE POINT IS, SON,
  THE LUG DIDN'T PLAN AHEAD,

964
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,144
      AND THE GOVERNMENT

          - POOR GUY.

972
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:45,728
- SON, WE'RE FAMILY NOW.

973
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,130
  WE DON'T NEED ANY LAWYERS.

980
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,985
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'LL GIVE
THESE JEWELS TO YOUR DAUGHTER?

00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,626
      ALL RIGHT, CONNIE,
NEVER MIND ABOUT HER NOW.

1016
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,842
        - YOU DO?
    - SIT DOWN, SWEETHEART.

1017
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:14,744
YOU SHOULDN'T BE STANDING
      IN YOUR CONDITION.

1018
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,412
 - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1019
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,081
    - YOU'RE HAVING A BABY.
     YOUR FATHER TOLD ME.

1020
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,783

1021
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,153
    AND HE'S NOT MY FATHER.

1022

      HE'S NOT MY FATHER.

1024
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,864

00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,433
     - OF COURSE HE KNOWS
      HE'S NOT MY FATHER.

        IS THAT?

1027
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,137
        - THEN HE KNOWS
YOU'RE NOT HIS DAUGHTER?

1028

            - YES.
    I LIED TO YOU, ANTHONY.

            - YES!
        GET USED TO IT!

1177
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,599
        - [gasps]
     I'M MARRYING A BRUTE.

1178
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,635
    I NEVER WANNA SEE
    YOUR FACE AGAIN--

1179
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,203
      UNTIL THE WEDDING!

1180
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,805
    - THAT'S FINE WITH ME!

1181
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:07,276
AND SEPARATE HONEYMOONS!

1182
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,310
            - FINE!

1183
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,413
     - SEE YOU IN CHURCH!

1184
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,181
            - HMPH!

1185
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,819
    [doorbell rings]

1186
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,821
 - IT'S PROBABLY JUDGE CRATER.

1187
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,391
      OH, HI, DR. POOLE.

1188
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,259
          COME ON IN.
 THE BOSS BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

1189
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,761
         - [chuckling]

1190
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,396
     ALDO, DO YOU REALIZE
      WHAT YOU JUST DID?

1191
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,797
            - WHAT?

1192
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:33,669
- YOU USED THE PAST PARTICIPLE
      WITHOUT A MODIFIER.

1193
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,939
        - I DID?
    WHAT'S THE RAP ON THAT?

1194
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:40,242
     COOL YOUR HEELS, DOC.
HE'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

1195
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,411
         - MARVELOUS.

1196
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,249
ALDO IS A TREASURE TROVE
OF LINGUISTIC ANOMALIES.

1197
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:50,485
    - I "HOID" THAT.

1198
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,924
         - MIDDLESEX.

1199
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,660
            - WHAT?

1200
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:01,496
- YOU'RE FROM MIDDLESEX COUNTY
        IN NEW JERSEY.

1201
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:02,864
          AM I RIGHT?

1202
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,700
            - YEAH.
        NEW BRUNSWICK.

1203
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,969
         - I KNEW IT.

1204
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,371
        YOU SEE,
     THE NEW JERSEY ACCENT

1205
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:12,908
  BECOMES INCREASINGLY NASAL
  THE FURTHER SOUTH ONE GOES.

1206
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:16,645
        - THAT'S
  AN AMAZING TALENT, DOCTOR.

1207
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:19,982
     HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
     OF WORKING CARNIVALS?

1208
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,884
         - YOUNG MAN,
I'VE MADE A SERIOUS STUDY

1209
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,620
OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

1210
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:28,957
 IN MY TRAVELS, I'VE UNCOVERED
    2,700 SUBDIALECTS

1211
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,426
  IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE.

1212
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:35,597
 NOW, YOU TAKE THE ATTENUATED
  VOWELS OF THE EAST TEXANS--

1213
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,667
  - ALL THAT TRAVEL MUST CUT
 INTO YOUR HOME LIFE, DOCTOR.

1214
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:41,603
     - WELL, I DON'T SPEND
AS MUCH TIME WITH MOTHER

1215
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,038
    AS I WLD LIKE.

1216
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:46,241
    BUT SHE'S GOT THE CATS.

1217
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,910
     - A BRILLIANT SCHOLAR
LIKE YOURSELF IS STILL SINGLE?

1218
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,912
          - OH, WORK
    HAS ALWAYS COME FIRST.

1219
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,749
         THIS WEEKEND
     I'M OFF TO APPALACHIA

1220
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,385
        TO STUDY
    REGIONAL COLLOQUIALISMS

1221
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:58,487
     AMONG THE COAL-MINING
          COMMUNITY.

1222
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:00,856
     - WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
    A MINUTE, DOCTOR?

1223
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,557
  YOU'LL BE HERE FOR A WHILE,
          WON'T YOU?

1224
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,026
          - OH, YES.

1225
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:07,562
 I'LL BE GIVING MR. PROVOLONE
     HIS ELOCUTION LESSON.

1226
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,505
  - GOOD NEWS--WE DON'T HAVE
     TO MARRY EACH OTHER.

1227
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,173
     I FOUND SOMEONE ELSE.

1228
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,142
            - WHO?

1229
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,544
- SOMEONE WHO'S HANDSOME
        AND INTELLIGENT

1230
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,814
    AND WORSHIPS THE GROUND
  YOU WALK UPON...DR. POOLE.

1231
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,182
         - [laughing]
          DR. POOLE.

1232
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,484
     SAY, WHAT'S THE GAG?

1233
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,420
        HE'S OLD ENOUGH
    TO BE MY FATHER.

1234
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:36,024
 - MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE'S OLD
ENOUGH TO BE YOUR BABY'S FATHER.

1235
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,193
    - WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
     HE WANTS TO MARRY ME?

1236
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,595
    - BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU
         PASSIONATELY.

1237
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,464
    HE JUST TOLD ME.

1238
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,966
     - BUT HE'S NEVER SAID
        ANYTHING.

1239
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,535
      - IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

1240
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:48,603
    A MAN WHOSE LIFE
     IS DEVOTED TO WORDS,

1241
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,840
AND HE CAN'T PUT TOGETHER
THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT ONES.

1242
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:54,276
     - THAT'S SO TOUCHING.
 - I KNEW YOU'D SEE IT MY WAY.

1243
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,511
    STAY RIGHT HERE.

1244
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,582
 - FINUCCIS IN, FINUCCIS OUT,
         FINUCCIS IN.

1245
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,551
    HE GIVE ME AGITA.

1246
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:08,490
        - LISA...
  ANTHONY'S TRYING TO TELL ME

1247
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,692
    THAT NOW YOU'RE IN LOVE
        WITH DR. POOLE.

1248
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,793
         - YES, I AM.

1249
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:13,562
          - YOU SEE?
             WHAT?

1250
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:14,930
    - OH, DADDY, YES.

1251
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,733
HE'S SO SWEET, SO INTELLIGENT,
        SO CULTURED...

1252
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,602
        NOT LIKE
SOME OTHER FELLAS I KNOW.

1253
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,370
    - WELL, PUT POOLE
    OUT OF YOUR MIND.

1254
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:23,939
YOU'RE MARRYING ANTHONY.

1255
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:25,640
    - BUT I LOVE THORNTON!

1256
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,476
  - OH, SO NOW IT'S THORNTON?

1257
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,378
          - [sobbing]

1258
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,382
- OH, STOP THAT BAWLIN',
        WILL YA?

1259
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,486
 - HE'S THE ONLY SENSITIVE MAN
        I'VE EVER MET.

1260
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,221
    - WHAT ARE YOU SAYIN'?
      I'M NOT SENSITIVE?

1261
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,190
    - [braying sobs]

1262
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,293
      - ALL RIGHT, LISA.
  LISA, STOP--WILL YOU STOP--

1263
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:49,865
        [snaps fingers]
- [squeaky inhale, stops crying]

1264
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,200
- IF IT'S POOLE YOU WANT,
    IT'S POOLE YOU'LL GET,

1265
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,203
  BUT, LISA, YOU GOT TO CROSS
 THE FINISH LINE ON THIS ONE.

1266
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:59,307
 HE'S YOUR THIRD FIANCE TODAY,
 AND IT'S NOT EVEN LUNCH YET!

1267
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,248
    - LOOK, MR. PROVOLONE,
  NOW THAT SHE HAS A HUSBAND,

1268
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,949
        CAN I HAVE BACK
    THE STATEMENT I SIGNED?

1269
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:10,118
      - FORGET ABOUT IT.
 I'M KEEPING YOU ON THE BENCH

1270
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,921
    IN CASE THIS GUY
     DOESN'T COME THROUGH.

1271
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,359
      GOOD MORNIN', DOC.

1272
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,762
  - NOW, NOW, MR. PROVOLONE.

1273
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,464
      WHERE ARE THOSE Gs?

1274
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:25,200
          - IN HERE.

1275
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,169
        - NO, NO.

1276
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,037
    YOU'RE NOT ENUNCIATING.

1277
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,940
  "GOOD MORNING, DR. POOLE."

1278
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:34,409
      - OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

1279
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,244
        DON'T YOU HAVE
    SOMETHIN' TO DO?

1280
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,280
         - YES, I DO,
     AS A MATTER OF FACT.

1281
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:41,483
GOOD-BYE, MR. PROVOLONE.
     GOOD-BYE, DR. POOLE.

1282
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,386
    - [snaps fingers]

1283
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:54,763
         - NOW, LOOK,
THAT GUY'S LEAVIN' AGAIN.

1284
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,531
  - AND HERE COMES A PRIEST.

1285
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,572
        - ENTER AT YOUR
    OWN RISK, FATHER.

1286
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,608
- ALDO, HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
        AT MASS LATELY.

1287
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,411
     - OH, REALLY, FATHER?
     I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

1288
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,516
    - NOW, REMEMBER,
        MR. PROVOLONE,

1289
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,985
        SPEECH IS MAN'S
      MOST IMPORTANT TOOL

1290
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,587
      FOR THE CONVEYANCE
          OF THOUGHT.

1291
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:20,856
     - YEAH, DOC, BUT WHEN
AM I GONNA START SOUNDIN'

1292
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,757
        LIKE A BANKER?

1293
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:28,263
         - AFTER ME...

1294
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:32,000
 [rolling Rs] ROUND THE ROUGH
    AND RUGGED ROCKS,

1295
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:35,971
 THE RAGGED RASCAL RUDELY RAN.

1296
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,975
    - ROUND THE ROUGH

    AND RUGGED ROCKS.

         <i>THE</i> RAGGED...

1300
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,118
            - ROUND

1301
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,820
         THE RAGGED--

1302
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,189
        AW, LOOK, DOC,
      I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

1303
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,758
    I'LL NEVER LEARN
        TO SPEAK GOOD.

1304
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,229
    - DO NOT DESPAIR,
        MR. PROVOLONE.

1305
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,866
     LET'S TRY A NEW LINE
     OF ATTACK, SHALL WE?

1306
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:11,339
          AFTER ME...

1307
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:15,877
ROCCO THE RUM RUNNER RUBBED OUT
 RICO THE RAT WITH HIS ROSCOE

1308
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:19,848
          FOR ROBBING
HIS RUM-RUNNING RECEIPTS.

1309
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,217
    CAN YOU SAY THAT?

1310
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,352
    - ROCCO THE RUM RUNNER

1311
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,488
    RUBBED OUT RICO THE RAT
        WITH HIS ROSCOE

1312
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,223
          FOR ROBBIN'
HIS RUM-RUNNIN' RECEIPTS!

1313
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,225
         - YOU DID IT!
            - SURE.

1314
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:33,128
      YOU FINALLY COME UP
WITH SOMETHIN' THAT MADE SENSE.

1315
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,998
  - EXCUSE ME, MR. PROVOLONE.

1316
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,768
      I'LL BE GOIN' NOW,
      IF YOU DON'T MIND.

1317
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:41,503
    - SO WHAT'S KEEPIN' YA?

1318
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,839
        - WELL...
THERE'S THE LITTLE MATTER

1319
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,841
        OF A WEEK'S PAY
      YOU'LL BE OWIN' ME.

1320
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,209
      - SHE SHOULD PAY ME

1321
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,812
      FOR INTRODUCING HER
      TO BRUCE UNDERWOOD.

1322
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:59,688
 - I'M GLAD I'LL NO LONGER BE
    WORKIN' IN THIS HOUSE.

1323
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:02,857
  FROM NOW ON, I'LL BE HAVIN'
      SERVANTS OF ME OWN.

1324
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,963
    - YOU'LL FIND OUT
    WHAT A PICNIC THAT IS!

1325
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,298
     - SHOCKING INSOLENCE.

1326
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:14,369
I WOULD'VE TERMINATED HER
         IMMEDIATELY.

1327
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,805
  - I CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

1328
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:20,175
      THE BEST I COULD DO
         IS FIRE HER.

1329
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:22,744
         LISTEN, DOC,
    I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU

1330
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,213
ABOUT A LITTLE DIFFICULTY
     MY DAUGHTER'S HAVIN'.

1331
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,581
        - REALLY?

1332
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,150
    SHE SEEMS TO HAVE
SUCH NICELY ROUNDED DIPHTHONGS.

1333
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:31,920
     - THAT'S WHAT GOT HER
        INTO THIS JAM.

1334
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,588
    YOU SEE, MY DAUGHTER'S
          TURNING 18,

1335
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,156
 AND SHE WANTS TO GET MARRIED.

1336
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:37,058
    - WELL, SHE'S CHARMING.

1337
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:38,393
     WHO'S THE LUCKY MAN?

1338
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:41,496
        - YOU ARE, DOC.
      - WELL, I'M FLAT--

1339
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:42,864
             WHAT?

1340
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,733
     - YOU'RE NOT MARRIED
     OR ANYTHING, ARE YOU?

1341
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,701
  - WELL, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

1342
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,336
     - AND HOW DO YOU FEEL
          ABOUT KIDS?

1343
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,039
          - CHILDREN?
        WELL, I LOVE--

1344
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,041
     - THEN IT'S SETTLED!

1345
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,410
          - SETTLED?
  BUT I HARDLY KNOW THE GIRL.

1346
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,283
- LET ME SWEETEN THE POT.

1347
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,487
 NOW, THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
    I CAN DO FOR YOU,

1348
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:07,188
            SOME...

1349
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,358
      DREAM THAT YOU GOT.

1350
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:14,362
            - WELL,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

1351
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:17,399
  I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO TAKE
    MOTHER TO BADEN-BADEN.

1352
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:19,034
    THERE'S A DOCTOR THERE

1353
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:22,037
 WHO'S DOING SIMPLY MIRACULOUS
THINGS WITH GALLBLADDERS.

1354
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:23,304
    - [snaps fingers]

1355
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,006
    HER GALLBLADDER'S
    ON THE NEXT BOAT.

1356
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,175
        ANYTHING ELSE?
         - UM, WELL...

1357
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:30,111
THEN THERE'S THE THORNTON POOLE
    SCHOOL OF LINGUISTICS.

1358
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,380
- I CAN SEE IT FROM HERE.

1359
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,149
          DEAL, DOC?

1360
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,217
     - UH, I-I DON'T KNOW.

1361
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,620
  EVENTS ARE MOVING SO FAST.

1362
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,423
            - HERE.
     THIS IS THE CLINCHER.

1363
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,225
            - GOD.
         WHAT'S THIS?

1364
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,728
 - YOUR MOTHER'S GALLBLADDER,

1365
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:50,532
    THE LINGUISTICS SCHOOL,
    ALL YOUR DREAMS.

1366
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,333
             LOOK!

1367
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,973
- I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

1368
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,878
     - I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1369
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,718
             NORA!

1370
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:16,124
    - WHERE TO, LADY?

1371
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:18,726
      - REGENCY GARDENS.

1372
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,430
            - NORA!
             NORA!

1373
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:23,865
            NOR...

1374
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,333
              RA!

1375
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:28,536
 - NOW PROVOLONE'S COMIN' OUT
    WITH A BLACK BAG.

1376
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,807
 - WHAT DO YOU THINK'S IN IT?

1377
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,009
         - BAG MONEY.
          WHAT ELSE?

1378
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:41,249
         THAT DOES IT.
 I'M CALLIN' FOR THE WARRANT.

1379
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,955
            - DAMN.
          SON OF A...

1380
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,290
      GUN, GOSH ALMIGHTY.

1381
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,993
     CHEESE AND CRACKERS!

1382
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:55,697
- SO SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING,
    FATHER CLEMENTE.

1383
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,166
     ANGELO, YOU REMEMBER
    FATHER CLEMENTE?

1384
01:08:58,234 --> 01:08:59,801
      - MORNIN', FATHER.

1385
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:02,704
AND THANKS AGAIN FOR THE SWELL
JOB YOU DID ON PAPA'S FUNERAL.

1386
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:04,806
- I KNOW HE'D BE PROUD THAT YOU
KEPT YOUR PROMISE TO HIM.

1387
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,742
- THE FATHER IS HERE TO COLLECT
    FOR THE BUILDING FUND.

1388
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,677
    - OH, BY THE WAY,
        CONGRATULATIONS

1389
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:12,113
ON YOUR DAUGHTER MARRYING
    BRUCE UNDERWOOD.

1390
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:15,150
 - UH, I'M AFRAID THERE'S BEEN
    A CHANGE, FATHER.

1391
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:18,686
SHE'S NOW MARRYING A NICE
 ITALIAN BOY, ANTHONY ROSSANO.

1392
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,488
 - THAT'S ALL FOR THE BETTER.

1393
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,690
         NOTHING LIKE
    A BIG ITALIAN WEDDING.

1394
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,492
    ANTHONY ROSSANO!

1395
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,362
    - WELL, FORGET ANTHONY.
SHE'S NOT MARRYING HIM ANYMORE.

1396
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:28,763
            - WHAT?

1397
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,232
- W-WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.
    BUT SHE'S YOUNG.

1398
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,034
      SOMEDAY SHE'LL FIND
        THE RIGHT ONE.

1399
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,837
 - SHE'S FOUND THE RIGHT ONE.
            - WHO?

1400
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:38,406
         - DR. POOLE!
         - DR. POOLE?

1401
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,642
        - HELLO!

1402
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:44,412
    - GET BACK IN THE ROOM!

1403
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,282
         - LOOKS LIKE
    A NICE YOUNG MAN.

1404
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:51,819
- WHY IS SHE MARRYING DR. POOLE?
     SHE BARELY KNOWS HIM.

1405
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:54,222
    - SHE BARELY KNEW
      THE CHAUFFEUR TOO.

1406
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:57,725
    - DON'T DRAG OUT OSCAR
    IN FRONT OF THE FATHER!

1407
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:59,494
        - WHO'S OSCAR?

1408
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:01,663
        - WHY ISN'T SHE
    MARRYING ANTHONY?

1409
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,831
      - BECAUSE ANTHONY'S
    MARRYING THERESA.

1410
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,600
    - WHO'S THERESA?
    - WHO'S THERESA?

1411
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,635
            - LOOK,
IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE,

1412
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,204
     BUT I AIN'T GOT TIME
        TO EXPLAIN IT.

1413
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:11,873
      I GOT TO CALL NORA.
         - WHO'S NORA?

1414
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,175
          - OUR MAID.
          - EX-MAID!

1415
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:15,777
- NOW YOU FIRED THE MAID?

1416
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:17,912
    - NO, SHE QUIT TO MARRY
    BRUCE UNDERWOOD!

1417
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,781
    - WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?
        - I DON'T KNOW!

1418
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,916
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MY VEST
         AND MY PANTS.

1419
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:25,053
            - WHAT?
 - THIS IS ALL VERY CONFUSING.

1420
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,888
        - WELL, FATHER,

1421
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:29,224
        IT'S ONE
OF THEM MYSTERIES IN LIFE

1422
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,560
     YOU JUST GOTTA ACCEPT
        ON FAITH.

1423
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,495
         I GOTTA RUN.

1424
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,300
    - FATHER, WHY DON'T YOU
      GO INTO THE KITCHEN

1425
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:43,037
     AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA
 WHILE I CLEAR THIS MATTER UP?

1426
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:47,141
 - SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, BRUCE.

1427
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:50,678
NORA TOOK THE WRONG BAG.
     CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

1428
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,914
      YES. WOULD YOU MIND
    SENDING YOUR MAN AROUND

1429
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,716
    AND BRING THE BAG BACK?

1430
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:58,219
  YEAH, IT'S SNAPS PROVOLONE.
 WHO THE HELL YOU THINK IT IS?

1431
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:21,209
     - WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1432
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,577
     YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT
        ON THE OUTSIDE?

1433
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:25,513
      - I CAME TO RETURN
         THIS SUITCASE

1434
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,349
      AND COLLECT ME OWN.

1435
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,896
         - IS THIS IT?
            - YES.

1436
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:45,633
I REALIZED THAT ONE WASN'T MINE
WHEN I TRIED TO OPEN IT.

1437
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,135
    - GO ON. BEAT IT.

1438
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:48,903
    WE GOT BANKERS COMIN',

1439
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,873
    AND WE DON'T NEED
NO RIFFRAFF AROUND HERE.

1440
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,571
        - SUGAR?
        - OH, NO.

1441
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,873
          THANK YOU.

1442
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:38,252
         WHO TOLD YOU
    I WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU?

1443
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,688
          - ANTHONY.

1444
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:44,225
        - BUT I THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH ME.

1445
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,227
     - WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

1446
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,428
        - YOUR FATHER.

1447
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:50,031
             - OH.

1448
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:51,666
      AND DID HE TELL YOU
        I WAS PREGNANT?

1449
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:54,135
        - NO, HE DIDN--
    YOU'RE PREGNANT?

1450
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:57,805
  - NO. I JUST TOLD HIM THAT
    SO I COULD MARRY OSCAR.

1451
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:00,742
        - WHO'S OSCAR?
      - OUR EX-CHAUFFEUR.

1452
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,811
YOU SEE, I'D DO ANYTHING
TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!

1453
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,847
        - OH, I DO KNOW
         HOW YOU FEEL.

1454
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,316
     - [laughs] OF COURSE.
     YOU'VE MET MY FATHER.

1455
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,419
        - OH, NO.
 I WAS THINKING OF MY MOTHER.

1456
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:13,588
    SHE CAN BE SO...

1457
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,356
          POSSESSIVE.

1458
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:18,126
     - THEN YOU KNOW WHAT
 I'M GOING THROUGH, DR. POOLE?

1459
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,661
          - THORNTON.

1460
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:24,065
         Y-YES, I DO.

1461
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:31,406
            LISA...

1462
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:34,642
          AT THE RISK
      OF BEING FORWARD...

1463
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:38,212
    - YES, THORNTON?

1464
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,681
        - YOUR DICTION
     IS SURPRISINGLY GOOD,

1465
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:45,119
  CONSIDERING YOUR GENEALOGY.

1466
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:49,524

01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,660
        THORNTON.

    [doorbell rings]

1470
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,535
 - THAT MUST BE THE CHAUFFEUR

1471
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,837
         THERE IT IS.

        [snaps fingers]
        I GOT IT.

1473
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,115

1479
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,029
        - THIS MORNING

      NOW I HAVE NOTHING.

1482
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,335
     - WELL, DON'T TAKE IT
        TOO HARD.

1483
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:35,970
- I CAN'T EVEN CALL HER,

1484
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:38,973
BECAUSE SHE NEVER TOLD ME
HER REAL NAME OR ADDRESS.

1485
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,708
  - CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY.

1486
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:44,145
        - I'LL MAKE YOU
        A DEAL, MR. P.

1487
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,347

    YOU TOOK MY GAT.

1496

1497
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,325

1498
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:34,262
     - REMEMBER THAT DUMMY

     TREASURER AS A BEARD?

1502
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:41,335
         - YOU DIDN'T.

1503
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:43,871
  - I JUST WROTE OUT A CHECK
          TO MYSELF.

1504
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:46,107
         AS TREASURER,
THE BANK ASKED ME NO QUESTIONS.

1505
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:49,710
- ONLY A RAT WOULD STEAL
ANOTHER GUY'S EXTORTION MONEY.

1506
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:51,279
      - HERE'S MY OFFER.

        BUT DID I
     OR DID I NOT TELL YOU

1614
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:32,006
        TO KEEP AN EYE
    ON THIS PARTICULAR BAG?

1615
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,374
        - I DID.

1616
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:36,577
I WATCHED THE BAG OF UNDERWEAR
        THE WHOLE TIME.

1617
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:38,078
     - IT WASN'T UNDERWEAR
         WHEN I LEFT!

1618
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:40,447
IT WAS 50 GRAND IN CASH!

1619
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:44,084
    POOLE WAS RIGHT.
  YOU ARE AN OX AND A MORON!

1620
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,621
      - HOW DID 50 GRAND
    CHANGE INTO UNDERWEAR?

1621
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:51,492
         - THAT'S WHAT
        I'M ASKIN' YOU!

1622
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:53,694
- MAYBE IT WAS A MIRACLE,
        YOU KNOW,

1623
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:57,431
        LIKE THE LOAVES
        AND THE FISHES?

1624
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:02,302
     - LISA, COME WITH ME.

1625
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,738
        LET'S GET
     OUT OF THIS MADHOUSE.

1626
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:07,307
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, BABY.

1627
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:10,110
        - "BABY"!

1628
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:19,186
     - SNAPS, ARE YOU SURE
  THERE WAS CASH IN THAT BAG?

1629
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:21,088
            - YEAH.
LITTLE ANTHONY STOLE IT.

1630
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:23,190
 - IF LITTLE ANTHONY STOLE IT,
    THEN HE'S GOT IT.

1631
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:24,491
     - NO, YOU BLOCKHEAD.

1632
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:25,993
         HE STOLE IT,
  THEN HE GAVE IT BACK TO ME.

1633
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,328
- WHY'D HE GIVE IT BACK TO YOU?
- TO BUY BACK THE JEWELS.

1634
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,230
        - WHAT JEWELS?
- THE JEWELS HE STOLE FROM ME.

1635
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:31,665
    - HE STOLE JEWELS
         FROM YOU TOO?

1636
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,100
      - YEAH, SO HE COULD
      MARRY MY DAUGHTER.

1637
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:34,802
            - LISA.
     - NOT LISA, THERESA.

1638
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:36,937
 - HOW COME NOBODY'S NEVER MET
    THIS DAUGHTER THERESA?

1639
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,672
      - BECAUSE SHE'S NOT
     MY DAUGHTER, <i>CAPISCE?</i>

1640
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,974
    - YEAH, YOUR DAUGHTER'S
      NOT YOUR DAUGHTER,

1641
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:44,278
 AND THE CASH THAT USED TO BE
 THE JEWELS IS NOW UNDERWEAR.

1642
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:46,380
    - NOW YOU GOT IT!
          - I GOT IT!

1643
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:49,349
    I DON'T EVEN KNOW
    WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!

1644
01:24:58,026 --> 01:24:59,326
          - I'M BACK.

1645
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:00,994
      - <i>QUELLE SURPRISE.</i>

1646
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:03,063
         TAKE A SEAT.
THE NURSE'LL CALL YOUR NUMBER.

1647
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,635
      THE SKIRT IS BACK.

1648
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:09,736
         - WHAT SKIRT?
             NORA?

1649
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:12,272
             - NO.
    THE OTHER ONE--THERESA.

1650
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:16,110
 - YOU REMEMBER, BOSS, THE ONE
THAT'S NOT YOUR DAUGHTER.

1651
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:18,078
      - KEEP HER ON ICE.
  I'M LOOKIN' FOR SOMETHIN'.

1652
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,480
            - WHAT?

1653
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:20,948
  - A BAG JUST LIKE THIS ONE.

1654
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,083
 - AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

1655
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:26,286
        I GAVE IT BACK
TO UNDERWOOD'S CHAUFFEUR.

1656
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:28,188
        - YOU DID WHAT?

1657
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:30,224
     - IT WAS SITTIN' HERE
    IN THE LIBRARY BEFORE,

1658
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:31,725
         SO I SWITCHED
    THE BAGS FOR YA.

1659
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,727
- AND WHERE WAS EINSTEIN?

1660
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:37,030
     - WAS CONNIE IN HERE?
CONNIE, WAS YOU IN HERE?

1661
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:39,566
    I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

1662
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:43,036
 - WHY DON'T YOU GO STAND OVER
THERE NEXT TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

1663
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,878
          AH...MUSH!

1664
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,582
          UNDERWEAR.
    UNDERWEAR? UND--

1665
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,050
          UNDERWOOD.
     UNDERWOOD. UNDERWOOD.

1666
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:06,527
        - MR. PROVOLONE
 WILL SEE YOU IN THE LIBRARY.

1667
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:08,695
            CONNIE?
          - COME ON.

1668
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:19,273
- AND NOW HE'S BACK AGAIN
    FOR ANOTHER DROP.

1669
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,443
 AND YOU KNUCKLEHEADS THOUGHT
THAT SNAPS WAS GOIN' STRAIGHT.

1670
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:30,184
    [doorbell rings]

1671
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:33,020
            [rings]

1672
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,289
      - OH, THAT'S OKAY.
         I'LL GET IT!

1673
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,593
            [rings]

1674
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:49,036
          WELL, WELL,
  THE MAN WHO STARTED IT ALL.

1675
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,504
      - LOOK, UNDERWOOD,
        YOUR CHAUFFEUR

1676
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:52,239
    SNATCHED THE WRONG BAG!

1677
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:54,841
 WELL, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,
          AND PRONTO!

1678
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:57,778
  NOW, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

1679
01:26:57,845 --> 01:26:59,513
- CAN WE TALK IN PRIVATE?

1680
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:02,249
      - CONNIE, AM-SCRAY.
 - CAN'T I STICK AROUND, BOSS?

1681
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:04,351
      EVERY TIME I LEAVE,
        I FALL BEHIND.

1682
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:07,621
         - ALL RIGHT,
      STAY, BUT SHUT UP.

1683
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:10,057
    - MR. PROVOLONE,
        I'M DESPERATE.

1684
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:11,625
I'VE DONE A STUPID THING.

1685
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:13,360
        - YEAH, I KNOW.
     YOU ALREADY TOLD ME.

1686
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:16,797
         - NO, I MEAN,
I WALKED OUT ON ANTHONY,

1687
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:19,199
 THE ONLY MAN I'VE EVER LOVED.

1688
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,500
          - HONEY...
        [snaps fingers]

1689
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,402
  THAT'S THE FIRST SMART MOVE
         YOU'VE MADE.

1690
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,641
- I LOOKED FOR HIM EVERYWHERE.

1691
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:29,810
    I TRIED HIS APARTMENT,
     AND HE WASN'T THERE.

1692
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:31,345
    DO YOU KNOW WHERE
        I CAN FIND HIM?

1693
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:33,280
             - NO.
      BUT WHEREVER HE IS,

1694
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:36,250
    HE'S PROBABLY STEALING
    ANOTHER 50 Gs FROM ME.

1695
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:39,553
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
  I HAVE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT.

1696
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:47,461
      I MAY HAVE AN IDEA
         WHERE HE IS.

1697
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:50,364
        - WHERE?
- CLOSER THAN I THOUGHT.

1698
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:53,700
NOW, I WANT YOU TO STAY IN HERE
      AND DON'T COME OUT.

1699
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:55,402
YOU OWE ME THIS, SISTER.

1700
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,070
          - I THOUGHT
    SHE WAS YOUR DAUGHTER.

1701
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:59,673
          - SHUT UP.

1702
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:13,654
     WELL, LITTLE ANTHONY,

1703
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:16,857
    THOUGHT YOU COULD PULL
    A FAST ONE ON ME, HUH?

1704
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:18,925
- YOU MUST'VE FORGOTTEN,
        MR. PROVOLONE.

1705
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:20,927
I GAVE YOU THE CASH IN EXCHANGE
    FOR THOSE JEWELS.

1706
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:23,130
     - YEAH? BUT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO GET THE UNDERWEAR.

1707
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:25,065
    - WHAT UNDERWEAR?

1708
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,768
        - I KNOW.
     THE MAID'S UNDERWEAR.

1709
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:30,971
    - CONNIE, PLEASE.

1710
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:32,673
            BINGO.

1711
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,574
    AND I'M NOT GIVIN' YOU
    ANOTHER BAG IN RETURN.

1712
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:35,942
     I'M ONTO THAT RACKET.

1713
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:37,811
        - I DON'T KNOW
  WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

1714
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:39,279
 BUT YOU CAN HAVE THE JEWELS.

1715
01:28:39,347 --> 01:28:41,915
 - DO YOU BELIEVE THE COJONES
         ON THIS GUY?

1716
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:45,218
HE'S JUST GIVING ME BACK
         MY OWN DOUGH.

1717
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:47,020
         HERE, CONNIE,
          WATCH THIS.

1718
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:49,222
LOOK WHO I'M TALKIN' TO.

1719
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:52,225
 SO YOU'RE JUST GIVIN' ME BACK
      MY OWN ROCKS, HUH?

1720
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:55,295
- YES. I'VE REALIZED THAT
  ALL THE JEWELS IN THE WORLD

1721
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:58,732
ARE WORTHLESS TO ME NOW--
  NOW THAT I'VE LOST THERESA.

1722
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,634
     - THIS GUY'S A POET.

1723
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:02,169
    - AND IF YOU EVER HEAR
        FROM HER AGAIN,

1724
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:04,137
        PLEASE TELL HER
     THAT I STILL LOVE HER

1725
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:06,940
AND THAT I'M SORRY I HURT HER.

1726
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,608
  - THERESA'S IN THE LIBRARY.

1727
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,610
         - SHE'S HERE?

1728
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:12,512
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
  AND SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

1729
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,751
- ANTHONY, I AM SO SORRY.

1730
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:21,488
         - NO, NO, NO.
THIS WHOLE THING WAS MY FAULT.

1731
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:27,694
        - [sighs]

1732
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:32,366
        - I'LL GET IT.

1733
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:35,769
  MAYBE THAT'S THE UNDERWOOD
CHAUFFEUR WITH MY DOUGH.

1734
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,441
        - HE'LL GET IT.

1735
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:45,078
        - HELLO.

1736
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:47,381
          I WAS SENT
BY THE EMPLOYMENT AGENCY.

1737
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,483
        - I DON'T MEAN
     TO SEEM DISCOURTEOUS,

1738
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,618
 BUT I GOT ANOTHER APPOINTMENT
          COMIN' UP.

1739
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:55,088
    SIT DOWN, HONEY.

1740
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:58,325
  - I'LL TRY NOT TO KEEP YOU,
        MR. PROVOLONE.

1741
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,494
     HERE'S MY REFERENCES.

1742
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:02,362
I DO LIGHT HOUSEKEEPING,
        SOME COOKING--

1743
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:05,232
  - YOU DON'T, BY ANY CHANCE,
  ANSWER FRONT DOORS, DO YA?

1744
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:06,700
    - [snaps fingers]

1745
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:13,640
     WELL, ALL THIS LOOKS
     PRETTY GOOD, ROXANNE.

1746
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,542
 SO HOW LONG YOU BEEN A MAID?

1747
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,445
 - MY FIRST JOB WAS FOR A MAN
      NAMED JAMES BONOMO.

1748
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:21,548
- "JUMPIN'" JIMMY BONOMO?

1749
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:23,950
     HEY, ALDO, SHE WORKED
      FOR JUMPIN' JIMMY.

1750
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,719
      YOU REMEMBER HIM--
      NERVOUS LITTLE GUY.

1751
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:27,954
         - SURE, SURE.
        I REMEMBER HIM.

1752
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:31,291
    BIGHEARTED, SWEET GUY.
GIVE YOU THE SHIRT OFF HIS BACK.

1753
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:32,926
    WHEN DID HE DIE?
      - LET'S SEE, UH...

1754
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:34,227
     GOT THE CHAIR IN '27.

1755
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:35,896
    - I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

1756
01:30:35,963 --> 01:30:37,531
        I WAS A DRIVER
      FOR JUMPIN' JIMMY.

1757
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:39,633
     THAT WAS MY FIRST JOB
    IN THE RACKETS--

1758
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,334
    I MEAN, INDUSTRY.

1759
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:44,671

01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:56,983
        - REMEMBER YOU?

1764
01:30:57,051 --> 01:30:58,718
      HOW COULD I FORGET?
      YOU WERE MY FIRST.

1765
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:00,620
    I MEAN, WE WERE--

1766
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:04,524
     HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
      WHAT A SMALL WORLD!

1767
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:07,828

        FOR HER.

1768
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:09,162
            BUT...

1769
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:12,098
  YOU JUST DISAPPEARED ON ME.
        HOW COME?

1770
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:14,034
- WELL, I-I DIDN'T THINK

    IN THE BEST ATMOSPHERE
    TO RAISE MY BABY.

1772
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:18,338
    - YOU HAD A BABY?

1773
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,106
    - SHE'S A BIG GIRL NOW.

1774

         IN FACT, UH,
SHE'LL BE GETTING MARRIED SOON.

1775
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,910
      - AH, I'M SO HAPPY
    FOR YOU, ROXANNE.

1776
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:25,579

         SAY, HIS NAME
     WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE

          - KNOW HIM?

1785
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:49,069
SOMETIMES I THINK I DON'T KNOW
     ANYBODY ELSE BUT HIM!

    WAIT. THEN YOU GOTTA BE

     SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER,

1801
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:28,241
      BUT I DIDN'T THINK
    I WAS HER FATHER.

1802
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:31,945
- I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU...

1803
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:35,048
    BUT I LOST TOUCH
WHEN I WAS SENT TO THE CONVENT.

      - THIS DAY HAS BEEN
 AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER.

    TO HAVE THERESA.

1809
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:48,595
    HE SAID I BROUGHT SHAME
        TO THE FAMILY.

    HE MUST'VE BEEN.

1811

        WITH O'BANION.

1907
01:37:13,227 --> 01:37:15,728
OKAY, WE'RE MOVIN' ON PROVOLONE.
    WE'RE MOVIN' NOW!

1908
01:37:15,796 --> 01:37:18,131
         - A "C" NOTE.

1909
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:22,135
    - ORDER OUT FOR PIZZA.
WE'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR.

1910
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:31,311
      - WAIT TILL YOU SEE
     YOUR OFFICE DOWNTOWN.

1911
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,346
            - MMM.
YOU'LL HAVE A SECRETARY,

         A TELEPHONE,
 BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF THE HARBOR.

1913
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:38,985
          - AND A KEY
TO THE EXECUTIVE LOUNGE.

1914
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:41,454
- BUT NOT A VOTE ON THE BOARD.

1915
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:44,090
            - WHAT?
    LET ME SEE THAT.

1916
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:45,825
        - WELL...

1917
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:49,662
  WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SERVE
IN MORE OF AN ADVISORY CAPACITY.

1918
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:52,165
    - JUST UNTIL YOU LEARN
      THE ROPES, THAT IS.

1919
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:55,568
- AS SORT OF A SILENT PARTNER.

1920
01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:57,503
  - CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,

1921
01:37:57,571 --> 01:37:59,539
BUT I THINK FOR THE DOUGH
     THAT I AM PUTTING IN,

1922
01:37:59,607 --> 01:38:01,708
    I DESERVE A VOTE.

1923
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:03,376
  - AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
          GENTLEMEN,

1924
01:38:03,444 --> 01:38:05,378
MAY I CALL YOUR ATTENTION
    TO ADDENDUM "B"?

1925
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:07,714
          - OH, THAT?

1926
01:38:07,781 --> 01:38:10,717
 THAT SIMPLY ABSOLVES THE BANK
    OF ANY LIABILITY.

1927
01:38:10,784 --> 01:38:13,152
            - YES.
    SHOULD MR. PROVOLONE...

1928
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,954
 - SHOULD MR. PROVOLONE WHAT?

1929
01:38:15,022 --> 01:38:18,224
        - INCUR ANY...
      LEGAL DIFFICULTIES.

1930
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,859
    - LET'S NOT BEAT
    AROUND THE BUSH.

1931
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:23,229
     WE ALL KNOW WHAT KIND
 OF BACKGROUND HE COMES FROM.

1932
01:38:23,297 --> 01:38:26,633
- ANTHONY, IT SOUNDS LIKE
     THEY DON'T TRUST ME.

1933
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:29,035
- NOT ACCORDING TO THIS.

1934
01:38:29,103 --> 01:38:32,972
    - NO, MR. PROVOLONE...

1935
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:37,277
THESE CLAUSES ARE AS MUCH
 FOR YOUR PROTECTION AS OURS.

1936
01:38:37,344 --> 01:38:39,879
 NOW, IF YOU JUST SIGN THIS...

1937
01:38:39,947 --> 01:38:40,914
            PLEASE?

1938
01:38:42,249 --> 01:38:44,317
         - ALL RIGHT!

1939
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:47,520
     GRAB SOME SKY, HOODS,
         AND HOLD IT!

1940
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:50,089
      DRILL THE FIRST RAT
      THAT MAKES A MOVE.

1941
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:53,026
         - LIEUTENANT,
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

1942
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:56,129
          - I'LL BET.

1943
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:58,264
 - I WAS JUST SAYIN' TO SOFIA
         THIS MORNING

1944
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:00,333
THAT WE GOTTA HAVE THE TOOMEYS
         OVER FOR TEA.

1945
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:02,001
          [chuckles]

1946
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:04,103
- YOU DON'T REALLY THINK WE'RE
IN BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE,

1947
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:05,471
    DO YOU, OFFICER?

1948
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:08,141
    - WE'RE ONLY HERE
BECAUSE HE THREATENED US.

1949
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:09,609
        - THAT'S RIGHT.

1950
01:39:09,677 --> 01:39:12,645
         HE THREATENED
     TO PUT THE ARM ON US.

1951
01:39:12,713 --> 01:39:14,547
 - SAVE YOUR BREATH, FINGERS.

1952
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:16,616
      FINGERS FRISCHETTI,
    O'BANION'S TRIGGERMAN.

1953
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:21,521
  - IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO WATCH
    YOUR MIND WORK, TOOMEY.

1954
01:39:21,588 --> 01:39:23,256
         - THANK YOU.

1955
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:31,564
     AND THIS, GENTLEMEN,

1956

1957
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:37,470
     - I BEG YOUR PARDON?

1958
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,105
  - HEY, SID, SAY, "CHEESE."

1959
01:39:42,576 --> 01:39:44,277

1963
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:51,150
        WAIT A MINUTE.

  EITHER YOU GUYS ARE LEGIT,

1971
01:40:07,401 --> 01:40:10,370
  OR THIS IS THE GREATEST JOB
    OF FORGERY I EVER SEEN.

1972
01:40:10,437 --> 01:40:12,638
        - I HOPE
  YOU'RE SATISFIED, OFFICER.

1973
01:40:12,706 --> 01:40:14,507

      HE HAD ME CONVINCED

1974
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:16,576
  HE WAS FINGERS FRISCHETTI.

1975
01:40:16,643 --> 01:40:18,478
      - IT DON'T ADD UP.

1976
01:40:18,545 --> 01:40:21,080
WHY WOULD SNAPS PROVOLONE
 BE MEETIN' WITH FOUR BANKERS?

1977
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:22,815
    - MAYBE I WAS SLUMMIN'.

1978
01:40:22,883 --> 01:40:25,985
    - CLAM IT, SNAPS.

1979

    - LIEUTENANT, FOUND IT.

1986
01:40:48,142 --> 01:40:50,610
    - JUST AS I FIGURED...

1987
01:40:50,677 --> 01:40:52,845
         IT SEEMS THAT
     OUR FRIEND SNAPS HERE

1988
01:40:52,913 --> 01:40:55,615

 MOB MONEY THROUGH THEIR BANK,

      GET OUT OF MY WAY!

1994
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:14,367

1996
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:21,140
        I HATE TO SAY,
    "I TOLD YOU SO,"

1997
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:22,542
    BUT THAT'S WHAT WE GET

1998
01:41:22,609 --> 01:41:24,110
    FOR GOING INTO BUSINESS
         WITH A CROOK!

1999
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:27,747
        - I'M A CROOK?

2000
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:29,782
    YOU COME INTO MY HOUSE

2001
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:31,851
     WITH YOUR FINE PRINT
         AND ADDENDUMS

2002
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:33,920
    AND TRY TO CON ME
    OUT OF MY DOUGH?

2003
01:41:33,987 --> 01:41:36,589
JEEZ, I'M USED TO DEALING

    AS A BANK GUARD.
