00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,291
- Sokhela .

00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,833

00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,624

00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:51,291
Come in.

5
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,624
What happened ?

6
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,499
You do too , Momma.

7
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:16,249
You know that there is still a kid
who disappeared there?

8
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:33,874
Thank you.

9
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,416
Stop.

10
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,666
Stop!

11
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:31,874
Stop that!

12
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:39,874
Let me go!

13
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,541
Stop them!

14
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:43,499
Stop.

15
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,416
- Get off me!
- What happened to you?

16
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,624
My daughter was raped and murdered

17
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:21,166
by one of these degenerates

18
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:23,999
that plague our country.

19
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,999
You will find nothing here.

20
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,916
Have a good day.

21
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,833
You were seen talking to her.

22
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:55,124
I'll wait outside.

23
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:21,874
And you?

24
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,208
Me?

25
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:48,708
Thank you.

26
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:23,833
Good night.

27
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:31,708
Open up!

28
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,333
We looking for a man named Stan.

29
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:54,624
Don't know him.

30
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:57,833
Stan, stan,

31
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,291

32
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,999
Don't known him.

00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,999
And her?

34
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,749
Doesn't ring a bell.

35
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:29,708
This Stan is a Tik dealer.

36
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,041
We just told you,
we don't fucking know him.

37
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,833
We need to talk to him.

38
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,208
Go!

39
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,708
Do not move, I tell you.

40
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:44,583
Drop it!

41
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:46,541
Drop the gun!

42
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:47,624
Lose it!

43
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,374
What do you want?

44
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,499
Do not move!

45
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,666
What you looking for?

46
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,791
On your knees !

47
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:02,499
Fuckin' nigga'!

48
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:03,916
You're freaking out, huh?

49
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,249
You shouldn't freak out.

50
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:07,874
Listen.

51
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:09,374
We're cops.

52
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,374
Raise you hands!

53
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,333
You know what we do to cops?

54
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:15,666
We told you to shut the fuck up!

55
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,374
Here,

56
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,624
A chicken for our picnic, you understand?

57
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:36,749
What do you want?
A wing?

58
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,708
Crazy ass dirty looking cop
get on the ground.

59
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:54,791
You don't understand yet?
Shut up!

60
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,708
Cut off his hand!

61
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:03,708


62
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:05,499


63
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,499
- It that good!
- You're bleeding.

64
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,708
We'll just fry the whole chicken.

65
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,249
No. No please don't!

66
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:15,208
Little sister? This is Stan.

67
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,374
Stan?

68
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,999
Excuse me Father, I'll be right in.

69
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,374
Stan? What did you?

70
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,541
If anyone asks,
you do not know where I am.

71
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,791
- But ...
- I need to disappear.

72
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,333
What should I do with the other?

73
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:32,624
For the moment,
don't worry about it .

74
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:35,374
Just the usual.
The pigs.

75
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,291
They will pay you. Don't worry.

76
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,541
Cat wants to see you.

77
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,124
Thank you.

78
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,541
It 's been a while, so they say.

79
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:50,666
And who's your good looking friend?

80
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,208
Don't lie to me.

81
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,833
Hold it...hold it.

82
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:18,749
Let him in.

83
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:34,166
I came to talk.

84
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:39,291
And it won't be a discussion.

85
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,541
You're here.

86
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,416
Speak.

87
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,374
I don't know a Stan.
We don't sell tik.

88
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,583
- One of my men was killed.
- I know nothing.

89
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,541
Never seen that ugly mug.

90
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:15,583
Nope.

91
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:19,208
Never seen him.

92
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:38,124
I hope you're telling me the truth.

93
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,583
You don't know how to control your men?
Lets chat.

94
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:30,624
This new Tik, "Cam", I said:
only the kids in the townships get it.

95
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,291
This son of a bitch Stan
thought he could overtake me.

96
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:39,249
Welcome to you.

97
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:40,458
Hi Rasta.

98
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:54,999
Stan , you can not
spend your life being afraid.

99
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:57,499
You see my friend here?
Repeat it all.

100
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,499
Everything you told me.
Everything!

101
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:04,833
The cops on the beach

102
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,583
what did they want?

103
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:10,374
What? I can't hear you.

104
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,833
They were looking for me.

105
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,458
Because of the Cam?

106
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,541
The girl.

107
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,166
What girl?

108
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,458
White girl. The daughter of the rugby coach.

109
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,833
The botanical gardens girl?
You knew her?

110
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:30,166
I had sold her Cam.
We slept together.

111
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:31,999
And you killed her, asshole?

112
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,499
- That night, she blew her lid.
- You'd taken Tik?

113
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:38,083
Both of us...

114
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,374
She had too much.

115
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:42,791
She wanted to get high.

116
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,916
And we started to kiss,

117
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:47,874
but then it started to kick in.

118
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:51,416
She scratched me.
And went real crazy!

119
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,249
She crushed my balls.

120
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,541
I freaked out.

121
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,999
Who was that?

122
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:10,708
The guy who pays you.

123
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:12,749
Don't worry about it.

124
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:14,666
We must clean the house from the beach.

125
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,624
And this son of a bitch now?

126
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,749
Keep it cool.
He can still serve us.

127
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,499
Stop it.

128
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,874
Stop it.

129
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:53,249
Shut up!

130
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,458
He got where it hurts!

131
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,416
You'll never be a man,

132
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:37,249
small Zulu!

133
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:38,583
Let's hear you!

134
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,541
There you are.

135
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,249
Yes, good job. Thank you very much.

136
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:05,083
Good morning.

137
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,083
The kid that went in there...

138
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,583
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

139
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:37,499
- Did you tell the police?
- What?

140
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,041
That the kids disappeared.

141
00:50:39,209 --> 00:50:40,499
We must tell them!

142
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:44,999
Excuse me, but the police couldn't
care less about those street kids.

143
00:51:42,459 --> 00:51:44,791
Oh, that's my son, that's my...

144
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:52,583
Not to search any township.

145
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:38,999
- Have a good trip?
- Miserable.

146
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:43,333
Five hours late. The airport
in Zurich was under the snow.

147
00:53:44,709 --> 00:53:47,791
But it was worth it.
They are very interested.

148
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,041
- How?
- 40.

149
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,541
To health.

150
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:57,041
Once the trunks
are in Zurich...

151
00:53:57,209 --> 00:54:00,874
We must act quickly.
One of the cops found the house.

152
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:02,624
You had everything cleaned?

153
00:54:02,792 --> 00:54:03,791
Ya.

154
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,666
In 2 or 3 days, everything will be finished.

155
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,624
In the meantime, we will throw the cops
a bone.

156
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:36,416
Don't leave it to chance.

157
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:02,208
You can not...

158
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,083
Shut up!

159
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:11,874
I read what Stan
did to your friend.

160
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:14,083
Don't tell me you know how to read.

161
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,666
I have daughters
who taught me.

162
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,249
We leave tonight.

163
01:10:10,209 --> 01:10:12,833
I need you clean everything.

164
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:17,749
And don't forget
about the pigs.

165
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,291
Do not worry,
I am a true Zulu.

166
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:41,541
I know.

167
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,249
Where?

168
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:06,874
Do not forget that I, too,
I am Zulu.

169
01:12:07,084 --> 01:12:08,708
As much as you !

170
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,124
I know.

171
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:11,416
I know.

172
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,708
Hello. What are you doing here,
old woman?

173
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:33,999
Have you seen?

174
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:41,999
And you?

175
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:56,458
You are not a nigga that will scare me.

176
01:32:52,834 --> 01:32:54,249
Coward.

177
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:55,874
Let go!

178
01:34:07,334 --> 01:34:10,249
Motherfucker, this isn't another white man.
This is the devil in person.

179
