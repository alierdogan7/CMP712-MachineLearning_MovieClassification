1
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,426
WOMAN: I've never seen
so much money spent

2
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:14,261
on so little actual fabric.

3
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:15,613
Well, you're
always saying

4
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:16,864
it's what's inside
that counts, right?

5
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:18,566
Yeah.

6
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:20,484
Look where that gets me.

7
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:22,219
Look, well, maybe you
should try wearing

8
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:24,154
something less "granny"
than the flannel PJ's.

9
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:25,756
Hey, they keep me warm!

10
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:26,863
You know what else
can keep you warm?

11
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:28,088
Yeah, coffee.

12
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:31,295
(laughs) There's a place on the
third floor. I'll pay.

13
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,913
Oh, man, I just
can't decide...

14
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:34,765
No, I mean, if you
just wait two weeks,

15
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,634
you can get it for,
like, half the price.

16
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:38,802
Yeah, but you're missing
the point-- I want it now.

17
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:40,771
Fine. So pay the money.

18
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,940
No. You're right.
I'll wait.

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,675
You're always right.

20
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,976
So we'll go
get coffee,

21
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,811
and then we'll go
back and get it.

22
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:06,864
(baby fussing)

23
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,485
Aw...

24
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:16,840
So cute.
(giggles)

25
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:17,975

(elevator bell dings)

28
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:48,288
We said we'd
be there at 4:00.

29
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:49,523
Do you think we'll make it?

30
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:51,659
Oh, we'll get there by 4:00.

31
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,378
Eva, your hair...

32
00:01:54,462 --> 00:01:56,347
What?
There's a huge piece

33
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:58,165
missing out of the
middle of your hair!

34
00:01:58,216 --> 00:01:59,866
What?! What?!
Somebody's cut it.

35
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,135
I have no idea.

36
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:02,503
Would you...?
Where? Where?

37
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:03,870
How much is it?

38
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:05,723
How much is it?
I don't know. I don't know.

39
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:06,857
How much is taken off?

40
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:08,709
I feel so violated.

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,860
(camera shutter clicks)

42
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:12,146
I would, too.

43
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:14,148
I mean, it's sick.

44
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:15,683
Isn't it?

45
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:16,848
Yeah.

46
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,600
BRASS: Four days ago,
a girl in a mall.

47
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,218
Now, this girl,
in a movie theater.

48
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:21,286
That makes 11.

49
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:22,971
At least that
have reported it.

50
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:24,222
I'm sure there's more.

51
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:27,859
The sheriff is pissed;
bad for the tourist trade.

52
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:29,110
It's the same story--

53
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:31,763
chunk of hair cut off
in a public place.

54
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,981
They never
even feel it.

55
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,482
Any of the women see anything?

56
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:35,683
So far, no.

57
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:36,985
Guy's a ghost.

58
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:39,871
Yeah. Well, at least <i>I</i>
have nothing to worry about.

59
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:41,840
(chuckles):
Yeah.

60
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:43,458
The whole thing
is creepy.

61
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,682
Ms. Bingham, this
is CSI Russell.

62
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:52,300
Thanks for coming in.

63
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:56,054
This shouldn't take
too much longer, right?

64
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:58,873
I'm just gonna run a comb
through a couple of times,

65
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,859
look for some
loose-cut hairs.

66
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:03,328
It could help us out a lot.
So...

67
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:05,546
you were sitting
in a movie theater.

68
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:06,564
That's right.

69
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:08,283
Wow. I haven't been
to the movies

70
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,601
for so long.

71
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:11,186
Which one was it?

72
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:12,237
Excuse me?

73
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:14,522
You a Matt Damon fan?
(laughs softly)

74
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:15,857
Uh...

75
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:18,042
I'm a...
Daniel Craig girl.

76
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,711
Me, too.

77

RUSSELL:
The, uh, tuxedo

78
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:22,280
and the gun, right?

79
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:23,414
Hard to beat.

80
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,884
So, Paula, you want
to tell me what happened?

81
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:29,570
I-I didn't... I didn't
realize it until I got home,

82
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:32,207
so he must have cut
it during the movie.

83
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:33,574
But I don't get it.
Why my hair?

84
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,894
Honestly, I have no idea.

85
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:36,945
You do have great hair.

86
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:38,329
(laughs)
RUSSELL: Well, there is that.

87
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:39,747
You didn't get
a look at the guy?

88
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:41,883
No. Just...

89
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:44,018
Daniel Craig.

90
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:44,752

91
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:45,770
I'm all done.

92
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:48,022
Yeah, I just have
one more question.

93
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,375
Anything else
strange happen lately?

94
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:51,693
You know, purse stolen?

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,695
Missing keys?
Tires slashed?

96
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:55,763
No.
Okay.

97
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:56,781
Good, good.

98
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:58,583
Well, I am glad to hear that.

99
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:00,952
Okay. Uh, bottom line,

100
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:02,737
some creep
took your hair--

101
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:06,407
don't let him mess
with your head.

102
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:08,793
Thanks.
I'll see you out.

103
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,412
Hold on a second.

104
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:14,048
Let me give you... let me
give you one of these.

105
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:15,083
Call me...

106
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,968

need anything.

107
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,353
Thanks.

108
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,620
Yeah.

109
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:23,758
Well...

110
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:25,143
looks like
she feels better.

111
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:27,178
And based on your performance
in there, so do I.

112

113
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:31,516

fetish doesn't turn into

something more.

00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,701
I got my guys doing welfare
checks on the other ten.

184
00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:30,086
But we need to assume that

185
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,670
there are more women out there
that didn't report it.

186
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:35,107
Well, let's hope they're
just shy, not dead, too.

187
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:37,910
Well, best way to know that
is to reach out to the press.

188
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:40,913
And create a panic?
In my city?

189
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:42,465
I got enough problems.

190
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,767
This one, you need to solve.

191
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:52,358
I think she was looking at you
when she said that.

192
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,443
(chuckling):
Yeah, right.

193
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:07,123
Chain is busted,
but the lock is intact.

194
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,792
She trusted him enough
to open the door to him.

195
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:22,972
Never had a chance
to realize her mistake.

196
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:26,075
(loud thud, cracking)

197
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:27,960
Looks like this is where he did

198
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:30,646
his extreme makeover,
psychopath edition.

199
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:34,066
(sighs)

200
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:36,902
Blow-dryer and curling iron
are still plugged in.

201
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,605
Traces of makeup and
hair dye in the sink.

202
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,607
So he snipped Eva's
hair at the mall.

203
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:44,243
Obviously, he was attracted
to it for some reason.

204
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,594
Certainly not the color.

205
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:47,329
He turned her
into a blonde.

206
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:48,697
You should watch yourself.

207
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:50,199
Well, he dyed her hair.

208
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:51,600
You should watch <i>yourself.</i>

209
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:53,252
True.

210
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:56,655
Where is the packaging?

211
00:09:56,706 --> 00:09:58,424
You know? The products?

212
00:09:58,491 --> 00:10:01,177
Guess he was smart enough
to take them with him.

213
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:03,379
Smart enough to wipe
down his prints, too.

214
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:04,830
Suggests planning.

215
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:07,800
Guy's not just sick,
he's dangerous.

216
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,770
WOMAN: <i>When we reported</i>
<i>what happened at the mall,</i>

217
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:14,173
the officer said
it was just some weirdo,

218
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:16,275
and now my sister...

219
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:19,411
I'm sorry for your loss.

220
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,865
It's the same guy,
isn't it?

221
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,152
You people should
have warned.

222
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:30,189
Listen, if I could bring
your sister back, I would.

223
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:33,375
But I need your help
right now, so we can

224
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,162
keep this from happening
to someone else, okay?

225
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:40,933
Now, after the
mall incident,

226
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:43,802
did your sister receive
any strange phone calls?

227
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,671
Did she think somebody
was following her?

228
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:47,857
Anything like that?
No.

229
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:51,310
Do you recognize
this dress?

230
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:54,280
Those sunglasses?

231
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:56,148
No. Why?

232
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:58,934
Your sister was wearing
them when we found her.

233
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,286
Those aren't hers.

234
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:01,670
You sure?
I know Eva's style.

235
00:11:01,738 --> 00:11:03,522
She hated retro.

236
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,325
Even as a kid, she refused
to wear hand-me-downs.

237
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:09,562
He dressed her up?!

238
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:12,665
What else did he do to her?

239
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:13,799
ROBBINS:
<i>I found no sign</i>

240
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,701
of sexual assault,
and besides

241
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:17,786
the facial lacerations
caused by the door,

242
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:21,624
there were no other
apparent injuries perimortem.

243
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:25,194
So the eyes were
gouged out postmortem?

244
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:28,297
Tissue is withdrawn,
nonresponsive.

245
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:29,381
Cause of death?

246
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:32,384
Well, it wasn't
the braid in her throat.

247
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:34,853
She died
of a morphine overdose.

248
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,306
The killer injected her
in the carotid artery.

249
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,709
Death was
relatively quick.

250
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:43,479
Boy, I didn't see
that one coming.

251
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:47,483
Okay, so our guy forces
his way in, kills her,

252
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,168
then he has his fun--

253
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:52,488
eyes, makeover, braid
down the throat.

254
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:55,658
And that wasn't the only
hair he left behind.

255
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:57,393
The killer used
hair extensions

256
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,329
to repair the area
he'd cut off in the elevator.

257
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:04,900
Not quite the same
shade as the dye job.

258
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:06,335
So what do you think
it all means?

259
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:09,805
He breaks her so
he can fix her?

260
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:40,919
♪

261
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:10,458
You ever see that
Japanese movie <i>The Ring</i>

262
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:12,009
about that creepy girl

263
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,184
who lives in a well
and vomits hair?

264
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,536
I thought the only
Japanese culture

265
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,287
that you knew about
was octopus porn.

266
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,473
You should be nicer to me.

267
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,591
Why?

268
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:20,842
I'll tell you.

269
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:24,796
The braid you fished
out of your victim

270
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,198
I sorted
and meticulously measured.

271
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:29,150
Henry ran mitochondrial DNA,

272
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:30,802
and it turns out
that the hairs

273
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:32,203
in the braid
are from

274
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:34,255
26 different women.

275
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,323
Twenty-six?

276
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:36,558
Including the 11 who reported

277
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:38,760
having their locks snipped
by our hair stalker.

278
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:41,596
I know what you're
thinking-- holy hairball.

279
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:43,097
That's not what I'm thinking.

280
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:45,884
What I'm thinking is, this braid
may be more than a calling card.

281
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,569
Like a list of
future victims?

282
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:48,903
If you're braided,
you're branded.

283
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:49,938
Mm.

284
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:51,072
Still doesn't
tell us who's next.

285
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:53,341
HODGES:
So what do we do?

286
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,410
Follow up with the list of names
we do know and see

287
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:57,812
if anyone's noticed someone
looking over their shoulder.

288
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,188
SHERIFF: Don't need to be
a profiler to see it.

289
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:11,292
RUSSELL:
Slender, 20s, long hair...

290
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:14,078
and these are just
the ones we know about.

291
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:21,135
How are we supposed
to protect these girls?

292
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,589
Well, we can't put a car 24-7
in front of every house.

293
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,307
You just need
to catch this guy.

294
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:29,611
Any no-shows among the women
who came forward?

295
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:31,312
Yeah, one:
Joyce Debernardi.

296
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:32,430
Henderson address.

297
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:35,433
I left a, a message
on her cell.

298
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:38,403
(ringtone playing)

299
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:39,320
Brass.

300
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:41,606
He was checking up on her.

301
00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:42,824
Hey, Jim.

302
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:44,909
(sighs)

303
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,947
Joyce Debernardi just showed up.

304
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,177
SIDLE:
Day shift got the call.

305
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:05,563
Similar crime
scene, same M.O.

306
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:07,582
RUSSELL: She was found
just like this?

307
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,002
Déjà vu all over again.

308
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:14,972
Not quite.

309
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:18,976
Eva's eyes
were gouged out.

310
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:20,411
This is different.

311
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:23,314
Proteins in the cornea
are coagulated.

312
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:25,950
Bastard used ammonia
to blind her.

313
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:33,841
(screams)

314
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:39,430
They, uh, found vomit in
close proximity to the body.

315
00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:40,598
Reaction to the chemical.

316
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,599
Unlike Eva,

317
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:42,884
she was alive when he did this.

318
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:44,102
Alive but helpless.

319
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:46,621
They also found partially
digested pills--

320
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,339
Succinylcholine
in vomitus.

321
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,458
That's a paralytic.

322
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:52,410
That's how he's getting
better at the makeup.

323
00:15:52,478 --> 00:15:54,495
(panting)

324
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,900
(gasping quietly)

325
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,452
He's taking his time,
he's savoring it.

326
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,304
He's getting more confident.

327
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:06,023
Which means he's getting
harder to catch.

328
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:17,550
(weak breathing)

329
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,990
(weakly):
Help...

330
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:50,916
Two women--

331
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:53,942
both have their hair cut by this
nut-job, now they're dead,

332
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:56,629
dressed up
like some '70s fantasy.

333
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:58,114
When did we get
the first report

334
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,315
of this guy cutting hair?

335
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:01,284
Three weeks ago,
Sheriff.

336
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:02,518
Three weeks?

337
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,853
Clearly he didn't just
step over the line.

338
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:06,139
This guy's escalating.
Fast.

339
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:07,273
What are you two doing about it?

340
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:08,324
Well, right now,
we're listening

341
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:10,276
'cause he's, he's talking to us.

342
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:12,078
He's sending letters now, what?

343
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:15,748
No, these... found
in the throats

344
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,916
of our two victims.

345
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:19,802
That braid has hair
from 26 different women,

346
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,488
including our two
murdered ones.

347
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:24,824
He's given us a list
of who he's going after.

348
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:26,476
11 of the names
we know,

349
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:29,212
15 we don't--
women whose hair has been cut

350
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:30,647
but they never came forward
to report it.

351
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:32,048
All of these women

352
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:34,684
are in danger
and they all deserve to know it.

353
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:38,655
I came here to be briefed,
not told what to do.

354
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:39,822
I understand,
but I think

355
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,391
we need to go to the press.

356
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,159
You know, any panic
this may cause--

357
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:46,312
it's worth it if we can save
just, just one life.

358
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:50,683
I'll talk to the mayor.

359
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:51,784
Thank you.

360
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:53,002
That's my job.

361
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,254
Do yours.

362
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:57,707
HODGES: <i>Dresses our victims</i>
<i>were found in</i>

363
00:17:57,758 --> 00:18:00,743
are both vintage,
no retro imitations,

364
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,179
the real deal,
circa 1978.

365
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:05,498
(snickers)
What?

366
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,583
I... I can't talk to you
behind that dress, man.

367
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:09,052
Looks like you're wearing
that thing.

368
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:10,236
Oh.
(chuckles)

369
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:13,022
So, '70s, huh,
you sure about that?

370
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,340
Yeah, I spoke
with an expert.

371
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:15,358
Oh, yeah, who's that?

372
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,193
My mother.
Mm.

373
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:18,728
She's a bit of
a clotheshorse.

374
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:20,530
Still has the figure
for it, though.

375
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:21,881
I'll take
your word for that.

376
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:25,368
Well, anyway, uh, hand-
stitching on the sleeve,

377
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,703
original label,
real silk,

378
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,607
all beautifully preserved,
thanks to dichlorobenzene.

379
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:31,607
You mean mothballs.

380
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:32,692
Exactly.

381
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,127
So I doubt that the
killer found these

382
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:35,278
on a rack in a
thrift store.

383
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:36,696
No, he probably
had 'em in storage,

384
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:38,398
then pulled 'em out
and put 'em

385
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,632
on our victims.

386
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:41,417
Perhaps these dresses belong
to somebody he knows.

387
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:44,453
Yeah, it's starting
to add up now.

388
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:45,722
Maybe it wasn't
somebody he knows

389
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,006
but someone
he was trying

390
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,175
to turn these women into.

391
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,010
The mayor and I wish
to assure the city

392
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:52,245
that we are doing all we can

393
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:54,397
to bring this perpetrator
to justice.

394
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:55,381
As a woman,

395
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,734
parent,

396
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,469
I understand your
fears, and I appeal

397
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:02,805
to anyone who may have been
a victim

398
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,558
of the Shear Stalker
or who may have any information

399
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:09,545
regarding his identity,
to please call 911.

400
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:12,699
Shear Stalker-- wow,
they already have a name.

401
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:14,284
You got the sheriff

402
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:15,618
to go public.

403
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:17,120
Very impressive.

404
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:19,789
I appealed to her sense
of civic duty.

405
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,007
And her fear of voters?

406
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,445
There's a lot
riding on this.

407
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,347
We'll catch him.

408
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:32,285
Hodges, um, told me
about the dresses.

409
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:34,354
I mean, we may not be getting
a picture of our killer,

410
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:37,173
but maybe we have
a picture of his obsession.

411
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:39,142
Blonde, size-six.

412
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:40,793
If she were in her
20s in the 1970s,

413
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:42,779
she'd be 60-something now.

414
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:45,481
What do you think
this guy's deal is--

415
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,616
fear of women,

416
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:49,685
something deeper, maybe
"Mommy never loved me"?

417
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:52,789
Personally, I always tend
to go to my <i>Psycho</i> place

418
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:54,523
when killers start
playing dress-up.

419
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:56,259
I always go to my
Ted Bundy place--

420
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,911
predator, narcissistic,

421
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:02,098
dissociative identity disorder,
woman hater.

422
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,082
I'm not so sure.

423
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,134
Tox came back
on our second victim--

424
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:06,252
same as the first.

425
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:07,303
C.O.D.--
morphine overdose.

426
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:09,589
I mean, tha-that's
oddly gentle.

427
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:11,591
He's putting them
to sleep, you know?

428
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:13,542
Plus, all the care
he's taking to,

429
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:15,711
to remake them,
to redress them.

430
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:17,780
Where are going with this?

431
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:20,233
You know, put it all together,
maybe it doesn't spell hate.

432
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:21,667
Maybe it spells love.

433
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:23,820
Love?! Really!

434
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:27,690
Well, he's still
gouging their eyes out.

435
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:32,078
That's true.

436
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,149
BRODY: These are the hair extensions
Doc Robbins found

437
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:37,166
on our victims.

438
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:38,501
The hair...

439
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:40,720
all came from one person.

440
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:42,872
I compared it to the 26 other
hairs we found in the braids.

441
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:43,856
Guess what?

442
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:44,891
No match on any of them.

443
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,844
So, if the braid
is a to-do list,

444
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:49,645
then this person
is not a target.

445
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:51,681
Henry run DNA?

446
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:53,582
Yep, hair and dress match.

447
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:55,017
Okay, killer
definitely had access

448
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:56,853
to clothes and hair
from the same person.

449
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,389
The person he's making
our victims into,

450
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,308
and I'm assuming that this
mystery woman is not in CODIS.

451
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:05,478
No, so I ran isotope ratios
on the hair.

452
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:07,830
I can't give you an exact
timeline, but it looks like

453
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:09,982
our mystery woman
has been doing some traveling--

454
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,434
Japan, Germany, Southern Nevada.

455
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:13,052
She gets around.

456
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,153
And not for pleasure.

457
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:15,555
I also ran tox.

458
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:16,873
Every time she traveled,

459
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,259
readings would spike in
alkylatic antineoplastic agents

460
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:21,377
and antimetabolites.

461
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:22,895
Cancer meds.
Turns out

462
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:25,381
Hamburg, Tokyo, and Las Vegas
all have hospitals

463
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:27,366
that specialize in rare cancers.

464
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:29,285
Which hospital in Vegas?

465
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,538
SIDLE:
<i>Dr. Bill Ryan?</i>

466
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:33,890
That's right.

467
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:35,091
Hi. Uh, CSI Sidle.

468
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:36,292
This is CSI Brody.

469
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:37,510
From the crime lab-- we called.

470
00:21:37,578 --> 00:21:39,312
How can I help you?

471
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:42,398
We are looking for a patient
who is-- <i>was</i> under your care.

472
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:45,468
SIDLE: We know that the, uh,
patient is female.

473
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,105
She was treated previously at
clinics in Tokyo and Hamburg.

474
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:54,143
You know
who we're talking about?

475
00:21:54,194 --> 00:21:56,645
I'm sorry, even if I did,
doctor-patient confidentiality

476
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:59,081
would preclude me
from confirming it.

477
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,216
SIDLE:
Of course.

478
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:03,035
Have you watched
TV lately?

479
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,104
The killer who is cutting
people's hair?

480
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:07,507
Does this patient
you're looking for

481
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:09,108
have something to do with that?

482
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:11,827
She may be our only way
to identify that killer.

483
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:14,180
SIDLE:
Yeah, doctor, um,

484
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:15,431
Do you have a wife?

485
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:16,832
Daughters, a sister?

486
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:20,453
Women all over this town are
absolutely terrified right now.

487
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:23,506
I carry a gun, and you
know the first thing I did

488
00:22:23,557 --> 00:22:25,057
when I stepped
off your elevator?

489
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:26,342
I checked my hair.

490
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:29,028
I looked behind me
to make sure nobody was there.

491
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:54,703
Look, I'm going to
go grab a coffee.

492
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:56,005
When I get back,

493
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:58,558
I hope that file
is still here.

494
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:02,478
Thank you, Doctor.

495
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:09,502
RUSSELL:
<i>Her name's Lucinda Kemp.</i>

496
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,888
Cancer patient,
Desert Palm Hospital.

497
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:13,722
She may be our killer's muse.

498
00:23:13,774 --> 00:23:15,724
Muse? Muse how?

499
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:17,827
Well, he's dressing the victims
up in her clothes.

500
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:19,779
He's making them up
to look like her.

501
00:23:19,863 --> 00:23:21,063
A younger version of her.

502
00:23:21,114 --> 00:23:22,164
Really?

503
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:23,633
A dying cancer patient?

504
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,370
That's some theory
you got going on there.

505
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:31,173
Well, I'm feeling a hell of a
lot better about it right now.

506
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:34,627
What do you think?

507
00:23:34,695 --> 00:23:37,713
Two dead young women.

508
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,085
And your muse is a dead ringer.

509
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,663
(thunder rumbling)

510
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,818
(doorbell buzzes)

511
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:16,986
(knocking on door)

512
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:21,056
(knocking)

513
00:24:22,242 --> 00:24:23,842
RUSSELL:
Paula?

514
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,995
Hey, uh, you said
I could call you anytime.

515
00:24:26,062 --> 00:24:27,112
Is something the matter?

516
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:28,998
I think somebody
was inside my house.

517
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:30,866
The sliding door
is open a little,

518
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,618
and there's someone
banging on my door.

519
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:33,836
(doorbell buzzes, knocking)

520
00:24:33,903 --> 00:24:35,921
Could you have left it open?

521
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:38,290
No... I don't... Maybe?

522
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,042
(knocking continues)

523
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,293
There's somebody
knocking at my door.

524
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:42,461
Paula, listen to me.

525
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:43,762
Can you see who it is?

526
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:44,897
Hold on.

527
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,854
It's a delivery guy.

528
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:53,255
I'm scared.

529
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:54,857
Do not open the door.

530
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:57,192
Tell him you'll pick up
the package later.

531
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,645
I'll send a car over
to check on you right now.

532
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:01,096
Okay.

533
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:03,032
Everything's gonna be okay.

534
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,883
I promise.

535
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:05,951
Thanks.

536
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:07,202
BRASS:
<i>I did a welfare check</i>

537
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,370
on Paula Bingham.

538
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:10,539
She's okay; really was
a delivery guy.

539
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:11,773
But I can't blame her, though.

540
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:12,875
Everyone's scared.

541
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:15,511
Sooner we catch this guy,
the better.

542
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:18,380
I'm just hoping
that Norma Desmond

543
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:19,965
can I.D. her secret admirer.

544
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,450
Talk to you later.

545
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:24,503
Mrs. Kemp, do you
recognize these women?

546
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:30,926
No, I don't think so.

547
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:31,960
Should I?

548
00:25:32,012 --> 00:25:33,228
They were murdered.

549
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:34,897
After that, the killer

550
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,299
gave them a makeover.

551
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,435
Dyed her hair blonde,
red lipstick,

552
00:25:39,486 --> 00:25:41,303
mascara.

553
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:44,306
That's... horrible.

554
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:46,425
Truly, but...

555
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:48,711
why are you showing them to me?

556
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:50,029
Those are your dresses, right?

557
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:52,164
Well, I mean, they certainly
look like my dresses.

558
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:53,482
They're my style.

559
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,317
My style never
goes out of style.

560
00:25:55,368 --> 00:25:56,535
I don't understand

561
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,703
why you're showing me these.

562
00:25:57,787 --> 00:25:59,154
I don't, either.

563
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:00,289
On the phone,
you said you

564
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,373
needed me to answer
some questions.

565
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,325
Now, I come down here,

566
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:05,961
and you're treating me
like a common criminal.

567
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:07,429
These two women are dead.

568
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:09,181
And the evidence suggests

569
00:26:09,182 --> 00:26:10,941
that you're our only
link to our killer.

570
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:12,450
Evidence?
What evidence?

571
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:13,786
Well, Adam,

572
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:16,071
the women were staged

573
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:18,390
in dresses that
had residual DNA.

574
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:20,893
That DNA matched
hair extensions

575
00:26:20,977 --> 00:26:23,495
that were attached
to the victim's heads.

576
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:26,248
Hair that came from your mother.

577
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:27,282
My hair?

578
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:30,119
No, that's impossible.

579
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:31,637
Well, ma'am, in
this day and age,

580
00:26:31,705 --> 00:26:33,622
everything's possible.
Really, Captain.

581
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,023
It's not.

582
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:40,028
No one has taken my hair.

583
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,316
Because the cancer
already took it.

584
00:26:44,384 --> 00:26:46,001
Three months ago,
my mother finished

585
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:47,586
her last stage of chemo.

586
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:50,422
You can see the results.

587
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:51,757
I'm... sorry.

588
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:53,258
I'm not.

589
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:55,377
I'm done being sorry.

590
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:58,380
Or... afraid.

591
00:26:58,431 --> 00:27:00,716
Or reflective.

592
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,651
I am in remission.

593
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,687
Thanks to Dr. Ryan.

594
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:07,656
And to Jeffrey's
positive attitude.

595
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:09,108
And who is Jeffrey?

596
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:10,676
Jeffrey Fitzgerald.

597
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:11,660
Beautiful man.

598
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:13,328
Inside and out.

599
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:16,782
Mrs. Kemp, is that wig

600
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,734
made from your real hair?

601
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:22,454
When I started to lose my hair,

602
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:25,290
someone recommended a wig maker.

603
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,177
I did my homework, and
I found the best: Jeffrey.

604
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:30,713
When your insides
are eroding,

605
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,700
your outside's
all you have left.

606
00:27:34,768 --> 00:27:37,469
Your, uh, wig maker, Jeffrey,

607
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:39,755
was he was the one who collected
your hair to make the wig?

608
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:42,024
No. I did.

609
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:43,225
I brought it to his studio.

610
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:44,193
It's out near Silverado Ranch.

611
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,344
Along with some
of my dresses.

612
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:47,229
As inspiration.

613
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,547
Inspiration?

614
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:50,232
Jeffrey is an artist.

615
00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:53,769
He asked me when I felt the
most beautiful, so that he could

616
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,987
repaint my life.

617
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:56,822
He knows hair

618
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:59,491
like Monet knows light.

619
00:27:59,576 --> 00:28:01,076
When was the last time
you saw Jeffrey?

620
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:03,212
Just a few days ago.

621
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,831
He still comes around
to give me a comb-out.

622
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:08,116
He sounds

623
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:10,969
very devoted to you.

624
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:15,257
(thunder rumbling)

625
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,043
(sirens wail in distance)

626
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:20,813
Mr. Fitzgerald!
LVPD!

627
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,157
Mr. Fitzgerald?

628
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:33,942
Police department!

629
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,167
(woman screaming)

630
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:45,938
(screaming continues)

631
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:52,160
Let me see your hands!

632
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:54,112
Let me go! Let me go!

633
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,131
What did you do to her?

634
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:03,272
Stop looking at my hair.

635
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:04,606
Sorry, I can't help myself.

636
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,108
STOKES:
Hey.

637
00:29:06,175 --> 00:29:07,609
You're just lucky your client's
not pressing charges.

638
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:08,677
Charges?

639
00:29:08,728 --> 00:29:11,113
I was performing a
service, which you

640
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,681
interrupted.
A service?

641
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:13,966
That's what you're calling it?

642
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:16,184
My client is...

643
00:29:16,236 --> 00:29:17,686
how shall we say...

644
00:29:17,737 --> 00:29:20,189
a professional woman

645
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,524
who lost a
valuable asset,

646
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:23,909
her hair,

647
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:26,261
but doesn't have the assets
to afford a proper transplant.

648
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:29,665
And so, I offered her
an affordable,

649
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:33,969
permanent solution:
stitching acrylic hair

650
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:35,254
directly into the scalp.
And do you

651
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,305
have a license to do that?

652
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:38,707
I'm certified in
body modification.

653
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:40,425
However, my main
trade is wig making,

654
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,711
for a clientele that
needs restorations,

655
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:47,382
not only of the hair,
but of their self-esteem.

656
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,433
Yeah, we've seen your work.

657
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:49,668
You're quite the artist.
Thank you.

658
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:52,271
I, uh, I like to think
that I give back

659
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:55,173
what God hath taken away.

660
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:57,626
Well, you hath a
very inflated idea

661
00:29:57,694 --> 00:30:00,061
of yourself, Mr. Fitzgerald.

662
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:03,999
Image is everything.

663
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:09,755
I knew this guy on days.

664
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,707
He had a hair phobia.

665
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:14,009
Any time there was a crime
scene involving hair,

666
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:15,911
he'd puke his guts out.

667
00:30:15,962 --> 00:30:17,863
He'd hate this.

668
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:19,080
I got one of those.

669
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:20,132
Really?

670
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,034
What's your kryptonite?

671
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:24,753
Braids.

672
00:30:24,804 --> 00:30:26,138
You got a hair thing, too?

673
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:27,689
No.

674
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:29,424
Braids.

675
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:33,011
Jeffery Fitzgerald
had a thing for braids.

676
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,984
And vintage clothing, too.

677
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:40,252
What?

678
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:43,755
That dress
look familiar?

679
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:46,425
I do smell mothballs.

680
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:48,927
(shutter clicks)

681
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,332
(thunder rumbles)

682
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:00,072
And I...

683
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:02,457
smell a serial killer.

684
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:12,184
(sirens wailing in distance)

685
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:15,103
I smell conviction.

686
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:16,221
FITZGERALD:
<i>So, um...</i>

687
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:17,739
when are you two crazy kids

688
00:31:17,807 --> 00:31:20,459
gonna let me know why I'm here?

689
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:23,445
Lucinda Kemp.

690
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:24,896
One of the lives
you "restored."

691
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:26,147
Yeah, yes,

692
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:28,200
I gave her back her hair,
restored her beauty.

693
00:31:28,284 --> 00:31:29,418
And you're still doing that.

694
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:31,370
You give her
a comb-out every week.

695
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:34,506
Is combing out
a crime now?

696
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:37,659
(clears throat)

697
00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:41,780
You know what I think
all this is for him?

698
00:31:41,848 --> 00:31:43,265
Foreplay.

699
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,499
Before you have

700
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,168
your real fun with
these girls, am I right?

701
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,805
Do you recognize
that morphine?

702
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:52,808
We found morphine
in two dead women.

703
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:55,727
I've never seen it before.

704
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:57,496
Our guys just discovered it
in your studio.

705
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,283
Just so I'm clear:

706
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,952
You found unmarked morphine,

707
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,253
in a place that I rent,

708
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:10,175
after you let yourself in
without an invitation.

709
00:32:11,744 --> 00:32:13,328
I'm sorry, I just don't see

710
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:16,581
how that problem
relates to me at all.

711
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:19,668
Legally speaking.

712
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,803
SIDLE:
<i>Fitzgerald can play cute</i>

713
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:22,838
all he likes.

714
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:24,222
We still hit the mother lode.

715
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,224
Lucinda's dress,
Lucinda's hair, the morphine.

716
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:27,426
We got him.

717
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,710
What about hair braids?

718
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:30,262
Greg's running them now,

00:42:11,621 --> 00:42:15,157
No, I know, I know,
I'm gonna go home in a minute.

901
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,942
I'm just not quite
ready yet, you know?

902
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,513
One of those days.

903
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,215
No, we're fine, we're fine.

904
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:26,835
Uh... my wife and I have
a little contract between us--

905
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,322
there are certain things
I don't bring home from work.

906
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,426
And, u..

907
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:36,628
well, today, um...

908
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:42,484
I lost one today, Catherine,

909
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:44,319
and, uh...

910
00:42:44,404 --> 00:42:46,655
you know, I can't
stop seeing her-her face,

911
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:49,307
and... can't stop
feeling like, you know,

912
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,994
there's something I should have
done, you know, something more.

913
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,780
No, I know, I know.

914
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:56,081
I-I will, I will.

915
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:58,483
It's, um...

916
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,002
I just wanted to talk to you.

917
00:43:01,087 --> 00:43:02,671
Knew you'd understand.

918
00:43:02,755 --> 00:43:06,755
