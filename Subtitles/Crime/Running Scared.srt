(Door buzzer)

71
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,158
Just wanna smell you. Just like that.

72
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:04,832
You didn't call, you son of a bitch.

73

Let me guess.
My pearls you've been promising?

74
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,636
lt's nothing, just a little recycling.

75
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,755
Joey, come on.

76
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,229
lf Tommy ever found out about that...

77
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:33,469
Ssh.

78
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:36,472
Just remember,
it's just our little insurance policy, all right?

79
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:40,633
Cos there's no way in hell i'm gonna be
thinking about getting some of this...

80
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:43,678
looking at you through some glass window.
There's no fuckin' way.

81
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,790
Now, Joey, come on. No, no, no, no

82
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,628
No. No!

83
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:19,472
Come on, baby. Baby, look at me.

84
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:20,959

- Nicky's around.

85
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,474
Nicky's busy.
l'll be quick and real quiet, come on.

86
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:25,994
Quiet? l don't think so. Quick, i can believe.

87
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,432
- You know something, Mrs G?
- What?

88
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,431
You're bad.

91

You got a cruisey rep?

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,560
l heard she likes to make it
on washing machines.

93
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,551
On select occasions. What else?

94
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,672
Oh, no, no, no. My sauce!

95
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:50,149

- Wait, that's how i like it!

96
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,593
Yeah.

97
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,237
<i>- Fuck! Come on !
- Hey!</i>

98
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,079
You use language like that,
you ain't getting no after-dinner dessert.

99
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,718
Go find Nicky.
l think he's up in the bedroom with Oleg.

100
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:06,554
Why's he always with that Russky kid?
Don't he have no other friends?

101
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:09,712
Joey, you know, they get along. it's fine.
What do you want?

102
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,553
l don't want him going over there no more.
That's what l want.

103
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,596
l know. He knows.

104
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,676
He knows.

105
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,436
l'll go get him.

106
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,716
Yo, Nick. Dinner.

107
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,636

- Oh, shit.

108
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,316

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,559
Can Oleg stay?

112
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,997
lt's already been three times this week.

113
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,116
l'm sure his mom would like to have him home.

114
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,589
lt's OK. l'm not even hungry.

115
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,156
l'll see you tomorrow. Go Razors.

116
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,190
You, go wash up. Those hands are scary.

117
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,717
Good night, Oleg.

118
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:05,199
Good night, Mrs Gazelle.

119
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,153
He's not even up there.

120
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,198
They turned the basement
into a sports complex again.

121
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:17,989
- How many times am l supposed to tell him?
- What do you want? They're just boys.

122
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,352
Dad, l won't do it again, l swear.

123
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:32,158
Don't you expect me to make book on that.

124
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,151
Now, go get your grandfather.

125
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,196

126
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,108
All right.

127
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,156
Hey, Nick.

128
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,477
Razors and Blues Friday night. 1 20 yellow, pal.

129
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,516
No way !

130
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,874
lt's gonna be a death match
between Chester and Erlich!

131
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:57,552
They're going home in body bags!

132
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:59,596
Red ice!

133
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:01,318
Hey, can Oleg come?

134
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,277
He's never been to one game, and he's...

135
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,828
Not this time.
Sal could only score me a pair of tickets.

136
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:07,512
Maybe next time, though.

137
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,876
Go get your grandfather.

138
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,156

l said, get up!

146
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:58,310
What is this?

147
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,311
Wolfgang Puck. It's your favourite.

148
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,356
lt's thick crust, you damn blyad.

149
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,110
l cut off crust for you . It will be better.

150
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,796
Bring me out a Moskova.

151
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,157
Hey. Hey.

152
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,278
Come here.

153
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,316
<i>Come here</i>

<i>Come</i>

155
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,356
Watch this.

156
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,836
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

157
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,593
l don't like cowboys.

158
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,636
Come on.

159
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,676
lt's the Duke.

160
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:50,512
Come, sit.

161
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,596
When l was growing up in Kishinev

162
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:06,672
we had no VHS, no DVD back then.

163
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,436
l remember...

164
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:12,717
l did a job for this friend of my father.

165
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,353
l pick-pocketed a key off this apparatchik.

166
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:22,879
The man gave me as a reward
this children's projector.

167
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,916
lt came with three films.

168
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,910
Speedy Gonzales, Tarzan Of The Apes,
John Wayne in The Cowboys.

169
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,312
l watched that thing a thousand times.

170
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,116
Anzor, it's getting cold.

171
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,316
l was nine years old.

172
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,553
l didn't know how long movies
were supposed to be.

173
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:56,349
My version of The Cowboys,
it was only 1 0 minutes long.

174
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:59,000
No John Wayne getting shot.

175
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,279
Because it was for kids, they left that part out.

176
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,477
l didn't know this...until l arrive in America

177
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,836
and see it on TV for the first time.

178
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,711
l hate it. l want my 8mm back.

179
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,314
Because on that one, the Duke lives.

180
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,910
Some things were better in the old place.

181
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,756
Not too many. Some things.

182
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,996
Let me show you from the beginning.

183
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,916
No, no, no. Not forward.

184
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,236
This part's better.

185
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,356
Without the Duke?

186
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,632
Where are you going?

187
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:04,676
You don't walk out on the Duke!

188
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,196
Govnyak!

189
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,872
She said he's always distracted
and he never finishes his work,

190
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:16,916
and she wants to get him tested.

191
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,434
She wants to get him tested? Tested for what?

192
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:23,751
l think maybe er...attention disorder
or something.

193
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,353
l'm not fucking ADD.

194
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:27,749
Hey! You don't use that word
in front of your mother.

195
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,673
- What's wrong with ADD?
- The other one, smartass.

196
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,199
He don't use that word, period.

197
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,033
l don't wanna be on medication.
You can't make me take it.

198
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:40,989
Don't even worry about it. There's no way in hell
anybody's gonna put you on meds, OK?

199
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:44,152
Tell that teacher to come to the rink
and watch him wax that puck.

200
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:47,789
- That's perfect concentration every time.
- That's different, Joe.

201
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:50,792
We're just trying to find out
what's going on with you .

202
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,552
She said some great things too.

203
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,791
She said that he's very bright,
that he's very creative.

204
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,236
You left that part out before. l like that part.

205
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:01,276
l got potential.

206
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,672
You taking a collection down there?

207
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,956
He must eat.

208
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,395
The little prick insults the Duke...

209
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,276
..he don't eat in this house.

210
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,589
You hear me, you little snot face?

211
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,318
Stay in your room!

212
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:03,356
Jerk off to your fucking Razors!

213
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,632
<i>Faggot!</i>

214
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,356
He's a growing boy.

215
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,036
What did l fucking say, sukka?

216
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,836
He has to eat, Anzor.

217
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,353
Please.

218
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:31,432
Who puts food on this fucking table?

219
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,916
Not you, blyad.

220
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,791
l'm the big man of this house.

221
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,792
When l say the little shit don't eat, he don't eat.

222
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,836
Anzor.

223
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,357
John Wayne was a faggot.

224
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,314
So Vicki Gilleto told me she saw you walking
hand in hand with Jeannie's daughter.

225
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,356
- The fat one?
(Gunshot)

226
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,116
Sounded like a gun.

227
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,076
Hey, Nick, throw me some bread.

228
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,476
Oh, shit, get down ! Get down !

229
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,872
Are you OK? You OK?

230
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,313
Jesus, Joe. What the hell?

231
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:12,118
Stay here. Motherfucker.

232
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:15,875

(Gunshot)

240
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,029
Don't you move.

241
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:36,189
You piece of shit.

242
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:38,840

-Nick, get inside.

243
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,956

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,436
Get back. You get back.

252
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,518
Where is he? ls he upstairs?

257
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,917

Who is it? ls he still in the house?

259
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,712
The little snotfuck ran out back.

260
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,911
Oleg?

261
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,434
Oleg? What are you trying to say?
Oleg shot you?

262
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,476
What are you?

263
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,516
A fucking idiot?

264
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,556
l didn't do this to myself.

265
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,230
The little prick would've done me too.

266
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,196
Look at him.

267
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,596
(Soundless)

268
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,559
(Gunshot)

269
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,558
(Shot)

270
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,116
Jesus, it's a fucking miracle.

271
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,670
Where'd he get the fucking piece?

272
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,830
- Fuck should l know?
- What, it wasn't yours?

273
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,876
No ! No way !

274
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,034
l got a .357 in the safe out back.

275
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,876
He had some fucking snub-nose thing.

276
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,035
Silver. Chrome.

277
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,350
Bullshit! Now you tell me.
l'm not playing around.

278
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,113
We saw where you put the gun
but he didn't take anything.

279
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:58,555
- Not with me.
- Well, he went back, Nicky.

280
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:00,995
l didn't know. l swear l didn't know.

281
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,470
Come here. Listen to me. Listen to me.

282
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,596
That piece? That's not just any hot piece.

283
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:09,592
- Tommy used it to burn a dirty cop.
- Oh, no. Joe...

284
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:12,513
Yeah. Listen.
On top of it, that kid's out there right now.

285
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:17,355
The cops are on their way. lf they find the gun,
or they find the kid and he talks, l'm dead.

286
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,356
- Fuck!
- Calm down. Calm down.

287
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,158
Calm down. We can get to him.

288
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:25,152
- You can get to the gun before the cops do.
- Oh, shit.

289
00:22:25,152 --> 00:22:27,196
(Sirens)

290
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,638
Hey.

291
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,475
- Where are you gonna take him?
- Memorial.

292
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,951
Hey, Mila, you should go with him.

Me and Nicky are gonna go find him, OK?

294

295
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,199
- You should go.
- Thanks, Joey.

296
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,918
- Yeah, no problem.
- l'm sorry.

297

298
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:57,476
(Police sirens)

299
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,109
Motherfuck.

300
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,591
(Car doors slam)

301
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:08,636
Come on.

302
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,036
(Door opens)

303
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:17,634
Police officers. Sir, do you live here?

304
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:19,676
No. No, actually l live next door.

305
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:22,274
l heard gunshots,
so l came to see what's going on.

306
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,032
- What did you see?
- Er...

307
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,436
l saw Anzor, my neighbour, in the kitchen.
He'd been shot.

308
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:32,273
- See who did it?
-No, he was screaming in Russian.

309
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:34,999
His wife asked me to stick around for the kid.

310
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,036
- You don't know who shot him?
-No.

311
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,716
l'm gonna need to take a statement outside.

312
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,836
l can't have you messing up the scene.

313
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:43,876
Hey, check it out.

314
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,553
l don't see nothing inside.
Maybe all the way back.

315
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,916
Forget it. Leave it for Forensics.

316
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,396
Sir, l need for you to wait outside.

317
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,316
All right. No problem.

318
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,116
l'm fucking having a heart attack.

319
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,349
- Breathe.
- l gotta find this kid. l gotta find this kid tonight.

320
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,638
Nick, l need to know places.

321
00:24:20,638 --> 00:24:23,393

322
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:25,516
- OK.

323
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:27,670
Joe, just take it easy.

324
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,034
There's no fucking time!

325
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,917
l want you to wait next door.

326
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:40,956
The second he shows up, call me.

327
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,279
l can't have to keep fucking talking to the cops.

328
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,920
You understand me?
The fucking gun is on the street.

329
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,355
This whole fucking thing's about to blow up.

330
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:57,910
<i>lf Tommy or any of those fucking guys

All right, Nick.
l want you to stay in the car, all right?

335
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,552
Don't get out for anything.

336
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:32,679
lf l'm not back in one hour, call your mother.
She'll come and get you, OK?

337
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,756
Excuse me.

338
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,636
Who's in the other room?
ls that Yugorsky, gunshot victim?

339
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:01,871
Teenager. DUl car wreck.

340
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,157
Lost?

341
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:06,117
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

342
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:08,236
No, wait, he took a bullet right here.

343
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:11,153
No, major trauma to chest.
He's been in surgery all day.

344
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,037
The guy was a cop.

345
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:16,556
Oh, wait. Yeah, they did bring someone in
about 40 minutes ago.

346
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,756
OR number 2. He's gone upstairs already.

347
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:19,909
That's this way?

348
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,476
Can l help you, Dr Donaldson ?

349
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:51,437
Yeah, the cops are waiting outside.

350
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:53,829
They need to run a match on this bullet asap.

351

My uncle.

00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:48,076
The Czar of Brighton Beach.

Nice joint.

372
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,516
He even sang a few songs.

373
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,718
He sings like a fucking toad.

374
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:57,429
Well, Sinatra he's not,
but he's a man with a serious reputation.

375
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,516
- He has a lot of enemies.
- Bullshit.

376
00:29:00,516 --> 00:29:04,036

377
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:06,714
Yeah. Well, l spoke to the officers on the scene.

378
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:08,711
There was no sign of forced entry.

379
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:11,360
But they did find some interesting shit out back.

380
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,591
Six cases of NyQuil,
and it ain't even cold season.

381
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:16,955

Hey, where's the stash?

396
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,116
Last stall, motherfucker.

397
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,796
Find the stash. Find it.

398

Go on. Find it.

00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,996
(Shouts) Find it!

400
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,558
We're gonna search this entire park.
He might still be around.

401
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,275
What the fuck do you think you're doin',
white boy?

402
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:24,716
All right, drop it, or l'll fucking waste the midget.
Come on !

403
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,395

All right, stay right by me.

408
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,112
Right here. Against the wall.

409
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:57,316
Don't you move. Stay right there.

410
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,193

Oleg.

414
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,113
l told you to stay outside.

415
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:18,795
- Did you find him?
- Get the fuck outside! Get out of here!

416
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:20,279

417
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,437
Find a gun ? You find a silver gun ?
Did you find a fucking silver gun ?

418
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:26,748

You wanna study for the GED? Here.

422

l've only been taking one class.
One class two hours a week.

425
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:04,756
l still got time to be pulling tricks.

426
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,875
Three Gs l fronted you
for these fucking airbags.

427
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,392
And what do l get in return ?

428
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:12,277
- Fucking night school?

429
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,749
l'm super proud of you
for showing some initiative.

430
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:18,070
Maybe l'll even come to your graduation.

431
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,311
But first you're gonna give me back
my fucking property.

432
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:23,038
(Gun cocks)

433
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,393
You learn how to use that
watching Sesame Street?

434
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,836
You ain't even holding it right.

435
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,395
What's the matter, kid? You got the shakes?

436
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,396
(Clicks)

437
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,989
Whoops.

438
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,315
Now l'm gonna put a smile on your face, boy.

439
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,678
Cheek to cheek.

440
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:55,149
You're gonna be the happiest little brat
in school.

441
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:56,719
Say cheese.

442
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,155
Who's laughing now, you fucking grey meat
limp-dick motherfucker?

443

(Gasps for breath)

449
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,356
Let me see your fingers, son.

452
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,515
Unless you have the number of his doctor
and l can get a prescription over the phone,

453
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,272
you'll have to take him to Emergency.

454

That spray shit is a controlled substance,

- Keep the change.
- l can't... This is stupid. l can't do this.

458
00:34:57,518 --> 00:35:00,672
Listen, why don't we go in the back

459
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,150
- Look, lady...

Nothing you can fucking do?

464
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:17,193
Get what he needs. Now.

- Yeah, l know.

466

No.

469

471
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:31,710
Tee.

472
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,356
Sal.

473
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:37,351
Yeah.

474
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,431
- Do girls really get naked in there?
- You'll find out when you're 21 .

475
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:47,909
l've seen Mom naked. It's no big deal.

476
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,711
Trust me on this one. It's always a big deal.

477

They make a good Mai Tai for a twat bar,
but seriously overpriced.

485

Jody! Come on, get the fuck out of here.

488

Two million dollars.

Suck a dick, you prick bastard.
You don't have shit on us.

490

What do you think of this?

491
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:05,555
Cops never found these at the scene.
Just two dead narcs and three dead Jamaicans.

492
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:08,438
Ballistics is gonna reveal the slugs
that killed my partners

493
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:10,431
didn't come from the Jamaicans.

494
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:12,511
So there were others involved.

495
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:15,433

What the fuck you talkin' about?

500
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:29,319
You blew my partner Stevie's balls off

501
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:31,311

Stainless. Polished up like a spic's hubcap.

This punk, Anzor Yugorsky?

514
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:06,188
He describes the gun to me in vivid detail.

515
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:10,034
Makes mention it's a snub nose
with a serious shine to it.

516
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,390
- The fuck is this guy talkin' about?
- He's talkin' about a fuckin' shiny gun.

517

Big deal. There's a thousand on the street.
lt ain't the piece.

She was concerned, in a neighbourly way.
She wanted me...

00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:54,030
Don't scare him. He don't know you're coming.

549
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,229
<i>So Joe</i>

550
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:02,153

about this thing with his nephew.

551
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:04,674
l told you, it's not the fuckin' piece.

552
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,190
Look, everybody knows the nephew
is a brain -fried reprobate.

553
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,157
Yeah, whatever. He's a tweaker piece of shit.

554
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:13,435
And he's cooking meth in his backyard.

555
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:16,353
lt's just a matter of time
before he blows up the neighbourhood.

556
00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:19,796
We know this.
But it's a sensitive issue with me, Joe.

557
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,559
l'm in bed with Yugorsky on this gasoline deal.

558
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:24,390
Hey.

559
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,629
lt's a good deal.

560
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:28,154
- l don't wanna rock the boat.
- Oh, fuck that.

561
00:40:28,154 --> 00:40:30,310
Fuck those Russian cunts. Huh?

562
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:34,598
Pop, it's the fuckin' narc

563
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,591
Hey.

<i>Calm down Tommy</i>

565
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,838
You see, Joe, the tweaker's got it in his head

566
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:45,912
that maybe you were looking to knock him
out of the cooking business

567
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:47,911
and helped the boy out.

568
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,479
Made a piece available to him.

569
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,519
l would never use a kid to do something like that.

570
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,315
Never.

571
00:40:55,315 --> 00:40:57,356
All right, all right, look.

572
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,194
I need a person to make assurance to the russky

573
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:04,397
that I'll have my entire crew in the street
out looking for that kid.

574
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:07,597
Now, in the interest of professional harmony...

575
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,035
..l think we all wanna get our story straight.

576
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,076
<i>You agree don't you Joe?</i>

577
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,719

Now l could get that prick out of your life.

Lock him up. l could do that, l'm a cop.

704
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,715
All you have to do
is tell me where you found the gun.

705
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:33,756
And where you stashed it.

706
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,479
That's it.

707

712

714
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,356

715
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:02,396
No, no, l don't understand.

716
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,796
l was prostitute in Moscow.

717
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,752
Yugorsky Escort Service offered to
bring girls over with promise of big bucks.

718
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,955
We would owe 50 thousand dollars.
You know, pay back through work.

719
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,717
l take offer.

720
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,756
Not tell them l'm pregnant.

721
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,236
When they find out...

722
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,076
..they insist l have an abortion.

723
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,076
l tell them no.

724
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,356
They send Anzor to kill me.

725
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,356
Anzor's not a killer.

726
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,031
He's not...a hard man like big Yugorsky.

727
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,076
(Sighs) He thinks...

728
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,516
..he thinks he's John Wayne.

729
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,796
Wants to do right thing.

730
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,869
He goes against his uncle, and tells
big man Yugorsky he will pay off my debt.

731
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,196
His uncle refuses...

732
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,036
..and tells him...

733
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,076
he will send others to kill me.

734
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,996
Set example.

735
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,756
So Anzor make me wife.

736
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,640
Big man Yugorsky can't kill his nephew's wife.

737
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,550
But he...tells Anzor to leave Little Odessa.

738
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,553
He's no longer working for Yugorsky family.

739
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,470
l'm gonna get you the name of a shelter.

740

- Erm....

755
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:07,758
l was supposed to head to the store
and pick up some milk and eggs.

756
00:54:07,758 --> 00:54:10,229
ln all the excitement l forgot to do it, so...

757

TOMM Y: Hm.

758
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,393
Yugorsky's gonna call us

He keeps giving me this bullshit story
about finding the gun

763

What do you want me to do?

765
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,079
The little fucker shot me.
He ain't gonna spill dick to me.

Oh, my gosh, yeah! You can see, right?

What about you, Oleg?
You wanna be in the film as well, don't you?

879
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:22,195
My stomach hurts. Can l go to the bathroom?

880
01:01:22,195 --> 01:01:24,236
Sure.

881
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,956

You take a right and then a left.

- Hurry up, though. You're missing out.
- Mm.

885

- Oh, good, dress up!

And the Volt.

888
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,911
There you are.
l thought you needed to go to the bathroom.

889
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,195
l couldn't find it.

890
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:01,838
Silly boy.

891
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:03,273
l told you to take a right.

892
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,390
Then a left.

They brought us here.
This room with all these toys.

01:04:13,238 --> 01:04:14,673
They're making a video.

913
01:04:14,673 --> 01:04:18,753
OK. OK, Oleg. l need you to look around
for an address for me, OK?

914
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,232
Um...is there any mail laying around?

She's gonna come back any minute.

01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,393
<i>Why?</i>

922
01:04:38,393 --> 01:04:41,119
They want me to say

923
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,156
(Knocking)

924
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,031

Do you see any...any bottles?

932
01:05:05,993 --> 01:05:09,436
Prescription bottles usually have the address
on the front label.

933
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,715
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

934
01:05:12,715 --> 01:05:14,631

942
01:05:39,149 --> 01:05:40,514

(Door bursts open)

952
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,996
Wake up. Wake up!

953
01:06:01,996 --> 01:06:05,231

01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,551
All of them, dumpsters.

959
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:26,392
(Both laugh)

960
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,956
l got you covered by tomorrow night.

961
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,835
Hey, check this out.

962
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,111

A royal flush put her in my pocket.

963
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:40,510
- Three hundred cold puts her in mine.
-No, man. She's a beauty.

964
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:42,556
Think l'm gonna hold on to her.

965
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,629
Five hundred.

966
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,879
Al won't miss them. Not until Cinco de Mayo.

967

Oh, Joe! Shit!

l'm under a lot of stress tonight,
so whatever l say don't count.

969

Do l still have to go to school tomorrow?

- Remember me?
- Who the fuck are you?

972

You got something that belongs to me.
Snub nose .38.

You scored it off of Manny in a card game.

Shit! What you waiting on for?

Where can l find him?
Where can l find him?

988
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:39,393
- l need to fucking know now!
- He booked a cab! Union Fleet. Ask them!

989
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,112
Stay here. Do not move.

990
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,116
OLEG: l'm not touching it.
Get away from me. Fuck you !

991
01:09:02,116 --> 01:09:04,395
DEZ: Ow, you little shit! Just bit me!

992
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,676
(Doorbell)

993
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,953
DEZ: Who the hell is that?
EDELE: l'll go see. Throw me my robe.

994
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:17,439
Take the kids into the bedroom.

995
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,836
- May l help you?
- l'm looking for Oleg.

996
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:43,071
- Oleg. You must have the wrong address.
-No. He's a ten -year-old boy.

997
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:45,310
He's pale. He never smiles.

998
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,312
He's my neighbour's kid.
He called me from this apartment.

999
01:09:48,312 --> 01:09:50,550
Owens Park Lane, apartment 303.

1000
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,835
Well, he must have given you
the wrong address.

1001
01:09:52,835 --> 01:09:55,036
Or maybe you heard wrong. There's no Oleg.

1002
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:57,429
He said that he was being held against his will.

1003
01:09:57,429 --> 01:10:01,229
That's ridiculous. There's only my husband
and my two children inside.

1004
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:03,709
- No-one else. And it's late.
- Well...

1005
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:06,394
l would like to take a look inside
to satisfy my curiosity.

1006
01:10:06,394 --> 01:10:08,835
This is absurd.
Are you suggesting l kidnapped Oleg?

1007
01:10:08,835 --> 01:10:13,357
You know what? l'm gonna call the police.
l'm gonna stand here waiting for them to arrive.

1008
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:15,590
When all's you gotta do is just let me in.

1009
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,079
lf you must.

1010
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,556
- Do you mind?
- Go right ahead.

1011
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,076
The children 's room is on the right.

1012
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:43,912
They are asleep.

1013
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:45,956
Please go right in.

1014
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,356
(Exhales heavily )

1015
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,109
- Hello.
- Don't ask, it's too ridiculous.

1016
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:01,156
Sorry, l'm really embarrassed.

1017
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,397
Excuse me,
but l seriously doubt he's hiding in there.

1018
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,636
(Dez mouths)

1019
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,596
- What's through here?
- Playroom.

1020
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,634
Whoa.

1021
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:27,756
Wow.

1022
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:29,956
You guys got your own little Disneyland in here.

1023
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:34,238
Well, it's all about the children.
And as you can see, there's no Oleg.

1024
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,951
l really hope that you find him.

1025
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:49,156
You hear too many stories these days.

1026
01:11:49,156 --> 01:11:53,631
- God only knows if it were our children.
- lf it were your children...photographs.

1027
01:11:53,631 --> 01:11:55,676
- Excuse me!
- Photographs.

1028
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,956
No photographs.

1029
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,469
lf they were your children, you would have...

1030
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:05,279
at least one photograph
somewhere in this apartment.

1031
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,796
This is ridiculous! We only moved
into this place. Everything's in storage.

1032
01:12:08,796 --> 01:12:12,236
Now l really must ask you to leave! l insist!

1033
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,356
Oleg?

1034
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,956

- You're making a mistake.

1038
01:12:37,714 --> 01:12:39,153
Tell her to leave, Dez.

1039
01:12:39,153 --> 01:12:42,232
Ma'am, if you don't leave right now,
l'm calling the police.

Why couldn't you have just taken the kid

Why couldn't you have taken the kid and left?

1101

l have never seen evil before tonight, Joe.

1102

l did not marry an evil man, OK?

1108
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:08,916
l did not marry an evil man.

1109
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,037
Shady, sleazy,
mixed up with the wrong kind of people.

1110
01:17:12,037 --> 01:17:14,076
But definitely not evil.

1111
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,997
l know what you're trying to say, Tee.

1112
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,989
Do you?

1113

Oleg, let's go take a ride.

You listen to that techno shit?

1121
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,073
You listen to rap music? You like rap music?

1122
01:18:03,073 --> 01:18:05,310
They don't have what l listen to on the radio.

Yeah, what's that?

1124
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,270

You're American, not Russian.
Why listen to that shit?

1128
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,032
My mother said l started in her belly in Russia,
so l'm Russian.

1129
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:26,715
You're not a Russian, you're an American,
cos you were born in the USA.

1130
01:18:26,715 --> 01:18:28,392
You're an American. An American.

1131
01:18:28,392 --> 01:18:30,072
Say, ''l'm an American.'' You say it.

1132
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:33,038
Say, ''l'm an American.''
Say, ''l'm an American.''

- l got the gun from Stevie Monroe's locker.

1146
01:19:05,353 --> 01:19:07,271
He doesn't go there no more.

1147
01:19:07,271 --> 01:19:08,918
Nicky told me to say that.

1148
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:10,672
Nicky told you to say that?

1149

Smart kid.

All right, thanks.

1156

Hold on. We're gonna go reclaim
some stolen property.

1157

1158
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,196
(Rap music in background)

1159
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,757
Don't worry about it.
We're just gonna sit tight for a while.

1160
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,028
You know...

1161
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,796
..l used to know this kid.

1162
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,308
His old man was a real fucking piece of shit.

1163
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,355
Always drunk.

1164
01:20:08,355 --> 01:20:11,352
Always smacking him and his mom around.

1165
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:19,230
This kid, he takes his licks...
and waits this old fucking prick out.

1166
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,833
On the morning of his 1 4th birthday,

1167
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,758
he walks into his old man 's room
with a baseball bat.

1168
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,958
Then he Mark McGwire's
the fucking living shit out of him.

1169
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,951
After that, the old man,
he can't even hold a spoon without shaking.

1170
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,230
He don't remember things too good either.

1171
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:49,276
He's neutralised.

1172
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,116
Which is a good thing.

1173
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,716
Four more years max.

1174
01:20:57,716 --> 01:21:01,156
Maybe three if you get some size early on.
You just gotta hang in there.

1175
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,997

He's a Christmas elf.

Joey's a funny fucking guy, huh?

1192
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,753
Let me take a guess, Joey.

1193
01:22:10,753 --> 01:22:12,910
You were just about to call us.

1194
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,195
That's pretty good. You must have telepathy.

1195

l must.

1196
01:22:17,838 --> 01:22:19,638
Give me your piece.

Cocked and ready to go.

1201
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,876
You're gonna follow us, Joey.
