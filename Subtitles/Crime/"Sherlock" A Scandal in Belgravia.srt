00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,440
- 'Who are you? 
- Jim Moriarty. 

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,520
'Bye! 

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,880
'Consulting criminal. 

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,200
'I have loved this, this little game of ours. 

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,960
- 'People have died. 
- That's what people DO!' 

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,400
' will stop you.' 

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,640
If you don't stop prying... 

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,560
..I'll burn you. 

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,960
I will burn the heart out of you. 

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,080
Catch you later. 

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,120
No, you won't! 

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,680
Sorry, boys! 

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm SO changeable! 

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,080
It is a weakness with me, 

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,440
but to be fair to myself, it is my only weakness. 

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,320
You can't be allowed to continue. 

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,760
You just can't. 

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,360
I would try to convince you, 

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,040
but everything I have to say has already crossed your mind. 

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
Probably my answer has crossed yours. 

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,320
MUSIC: "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees 

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,920
Do you mind if I get that? 

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,600
Oh, no, please. 

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,040
You've got the rest of your life. 

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,920
Hello? 

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,640
Yes, of course it is. What do you want? 

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,080
SAY THAT AGAIN! 

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,680
Say that again, and know that if you're lying to me, 

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,960
I will find you, and I will skin you. 

30
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,880
Wait. 

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,640
Sorry... 

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,800
Wrong day to die. 

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,720
'Oh. 

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,600
Did you get a better offer? 

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,600
You'll be hearing from me, Sherlock. 

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,000
So if you have what you say you have, I will make you rich. 

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
If you don't, 

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,760
I'll make you into shoes. 

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
HE CLICKS HIS FINGERS 

40
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,840
What happened there? 

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,560
Someone changed his mind. 

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,440
The question is... 

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
..who? 

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,160
- Well, now, have you been wicked, Your Highness? 
- WHIP CRACKS 

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:48,160
FEMALE VOICE: Yes, Miss Adler. 

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,920
POLICE CAR SIREN 

47
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,120
What are you typing? 

48
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,520
- Blog. 
- About? 
- Us. 

49
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,480
- You mean me. 
- Why? 

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,920
- HE COUGHS 
- Well, you're typing a lot. 

51
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,400
Right, then. 

52
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
So, what have we got? 

53
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,000
- My wife seems to be spending a very long time at the office. 
- Boring. 

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,280
- I think my husband might be having an affair. 
- Yes. 

55
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,400
She's not my real aunt, she's been replaced. 

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,440
I know she has. 

57
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,880
- I know human ash. 
- Leave. 

58
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,520
We are prepared to offer any sum of money you care to mention 

59
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,680
- for the recovery of these files. 
- Boring. 

60
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,120
We have this website, it explains the true meaning of comic books, 

61
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,160
cos people miss a lot of the themes. 

62
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,080
But then all the comic books started coming true. 

63
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,720
Oh...interesting. 

64
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Geek Interpreter, what's that? 

65
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,640
- That's the title. 
- What does it need a title for? 

66
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,840
Do people actually read your blog? 

67
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,720
- Where do you think our clients come from? 
- I have a website. 

68
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,320
In which you enumerate 240 different types of tobacco ash. Nobody's reading your website. 

69
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,760
Right then, dyed blonde hair, no obvious cause of death, 

70
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,680
except for these speckles, whatever they are. 

71
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,320
Oh, for God's sakes! 

72
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,600
- What? 
- The Speckled Blonde?! 

73
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,560
They wouldn't let us see Granddad when he was dead. 

74
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,520
Is that cos he'd gone to heaven? 

75
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,800
People don't really go to heaven when they die, 

76
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,920
they're taken to a special room and burned. 

77
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,720
Sherlock... 

78
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,400
There was a plane crash in Dusseldorf yesterday. 

79
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
- Everyone dead. 
- Suspected terrorist bomb. 

80
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,720
- We do watch the news. 
- You said "boring" and turned over. 

81
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,200
Well, according to the flight details, this man was checked in on board. 

82
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,320
Inside his coat he's got a stub from his boarding pass, napkins from the flight, 

83
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,080
even one of those special biscuits. 

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,480
Here's his passport, stamped at Berlin Airport. 

85
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,200
So this man should have died in a plane crash in Germany yesterday, 

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,360
but instead he's in a car boot in Southwark. 

87
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,120
Lucky escape. 

88
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,520
Any ideas? 

89
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,240
Eight so far. 

90
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
OK, four ideas. 

91
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,960
Maybe two ideas. 

92
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,760
No, no, no, don't mention the unsolved ones. 

93
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,360
- People want to know you're human. 
- Why? 

94
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,560
- Because they're interested. 
- No, they're not. Why are they? 
- Hmm, look at that. 

95
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,200
- 1,895. 
- Sorry, what? 

96
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,600
I reset that counter last night. This blog has had nearly 2,000 hits in the last eight hours. 

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,680
This is your living, Sherlock, not 240 different types of tobacco ash. 

98
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,400
243. 

99
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,760
So what's this one? 

100
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,360
Belly Button Murders? 

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,520
The Navel Treatment? 

102
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,680
Urgh! 

103
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
- There's a lot of press outside, guys. 
- Well, they won't be interested in us. 

104
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,320
Yeah, that was before you were an internet phenomenon. 

105
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,040
A couple of them specifically wanted photographs of you two. 

106
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,080
God's sake! 

107
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
- John. 
- Hmm? 

108
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
Cover your face and walk fast. 

109
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,880
Still, it's good for the public image, 

110
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,280
big case like this. 

111
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,280
I'm a private detective, the last thing I need is a public image. 

112
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,240
Hello. 

113
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,200
I think it's time, don't you? 

114
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,360
Oh! 

115
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,400
Ugh! 

116
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,480
SHE SIGHS 

117
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,720
Oh! 

118
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,040
Oh, dear! 

119
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,400
Thumbs!? 

120
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,200
The door was... 

121
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,920
The door was... 

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,160
Boys! You've got another one! 

123
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,480
Ooh! 

124
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,680
Tell us from the start, DON'T be boring. 

125
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,960
ENGINE SPLUTTERS AND DIES 

126
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
ENGINE BACKFIRES 

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
HE SIGHS 

128
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,000
Hey! 

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Are you OK? 

130
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,760
Excuse me! 

131
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,240
Are you all right? 

132
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,480
Sir, phone call for you. 

133
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,680
Carter. 

134
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,040
- 'Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?' 
- Who? 

135
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,800
Well, you're about to meet him now. This is your case, it's entirely up to you, this is just... 

136
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,360
'..friendly advice, but give Sherlock five minutes on your crime scene, 

137
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
'and listen to everything that he has to say. And as far as possible...' 

138
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,520
..try not to punch him. 

139
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,760
OK. 

140
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,320
- Sir, this gentleman says he needs to speak to you... 
- Yes, I know. 

141
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
Sherlock Holmes. 

142
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,360
John Watson. Are you set up for wi-fi? 

143
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,000
'You realise this is a tiny bit humiliating?' 

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,200
It's OK, I'm fine. 

145
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,680
Now... 

146
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,840
..show me to the stream. 

147
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,480
'I didn't really mean for you.' 

148
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,000
Look, this is a six. 

149
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,760
There's no point in my leaving the flat for anything less than a seven, we agreed. 

150
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,480
Now go back, 

151
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,520
show me the grass. 

152
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,720
When did we agree that? 

153
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,320
We agreed it yesterday. Stop! 

154
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,360
- 'Closer.' 
- I wasn't even at home yesterday. I was in Dublin. 

155
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,720
- It's hardly my fault you weren't listening. 
- DOORBELL RINGS 

156
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,000
- Shut up! 
- 'Do you just carry on talking when I'm away?' 
- I don't know, how often are you away? 

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,040
'Now... 

158
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,400
- '..show me the car that backfired. 
- WATSON SIGHS 

159
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,840
It's there. 

160
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,880
'that's the one that made the noise, yes?' 

161
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,080
Yeah. 

162
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,160
If you're thinking gunshot... '..there wasn't one. 

163
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,400
'He wasn't shot, 

164
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,840
'he was killed by a single blow to the back from a blunt instrument, 

165
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,440
'which then magically disappeared, along with the killer.' 

166
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,120
It's got to be an eight, at least. 

167
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,880
- You've got two more minutes, they want to know more about the driver. 
- Oh, forget him, he's an idiot. 

168
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,000
- Why else would he think himself a suspect? 
- I think he's a suspect. 

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,520
- 'Pass me over.' 
- All right, but there's a mute button, and I will use it. 

170
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,120
Up a bit! I'm not talking from down here! 

171
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,680
OK. Just take it, take it. 

172
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,480
'Having successfully committed a crime without a single witness...' 

173
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,200
..why would he call the police and consult a detective? 

174
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,800
- Fair play? 
- He's trying to be clever. It's overconfidence. 
- SHERLOCK SIGHS 

175
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,960
Did you see him? Morbidly obese, the undisguised halitosis of a single man living on his own. 

176
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,800
The right sleeve of an internet porn addict, the breathing pattern of an untreated heart condition. 

177
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,600
Low self-esteem, tiny IQ and a limited life expectancy, and you think he's a criminal mastermind?! 

178
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,720
- Don't worry, this is just stupid. 
- What did you say? Heart what? 

179
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,880
Go to the stream. 

180
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,680
What's in the stream? 

181
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,400
- Go and see. 
- MRS HUDSON: 
- Sherlock! You weren't answering your doorbell. 

182
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,840
- His room's through the back, get him some clothes. 
- Who the hell are you? 
- Sorry, Mr Holmes... 

183
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,080
- 'Sherlock, what's going on?' 
- You're coming with us. 
- 'What's happening?' I've lost him. I don't know what... 

184
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,280
- Dr Watson? 
- Yeah. 
- It's for you. 
- OK, thanks. 
- No, sir, the helicopter. 

185
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,080
Please, Mr Holmes, where you're going you'll want to be dressed. 

186
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,400
I know exactly where I'm going. 

187
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,600
- You wearing any pants? 
- No. 
- OK. 

188
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,400
THEY LAUGH 

189
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,280
At Buckingham Palace. Right. HE COUGHS 

190
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,680
- Ha, ha. 
- Aah, aah, I am seriously fighting an impulse to steal an ashtray. 

191
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,160
SHERLOCK SNIGGERS 

192
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT 

193
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,440
- What are we doing here, Sherlock, seriously, what? 
- I don't know. 

194
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,920
Here to see the Queen? 

195
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Oh, apparently, yes. 

196
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,840
THEY LAUGH 

197
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,480
Just once, can you two behave like grown-ups? 

198
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,880
We solve crimes, I blog about it, and he forgets his pants. I wouldn't hold out too much hope. 

199
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,760
- I was in the middle of a case, Mycroft. 
- What, the hiker and the backfire? 

200
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,040
- I glanced at the police report, a bit obvious, surely? 
- Transparent. 
- Time to move on then. 

201
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,000
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT 

202
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,160
HE SIGHS 

203
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,280
We are in Buckingham Palace, the very heart of the British nation. 

204
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,920
- Sherlock Holmes, put your trousers on! 
- What for? 

205
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,520
Your client. 

206
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,720
And my client is...? 

207
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,480
Illustrious, in the extreme. 

208
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,600
And remaining, I have to inform you, entirely anonymous. 

209
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,040
- Mycroft. 
- Harry. 

210
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,120
- May I just apologise for the state of my little brother. 
- A full-time occupation, I imagine. 

211
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,360
- And this must be Dr John Watson, formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers? 
- Hello, yes. 

212
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,200
- My employer is a tremendous fan of your blog. 
- Your employer? 

213
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,560
- Particularly enjoyed the one about the aluminium crutch. 
- Thank you. 
- Ahem... 

214
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,840
And Mr Holmes the Younger. 

215
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,400
- You look taller in your photographs. 
- I take the precaution of a good coat and a short friend. 

216
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,640
Mycroft, I don't do anonymous clients. 

217
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,360
I'm used to mystery at one end of my cases, both ends is too much work. Good morning. 

218
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,840
This is a matter of national importance. Grow up! 

219
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,600
- Get off my sheet! 
- Or what? 

220
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,200
Or I'll just walk away. 

221
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,920
- I'll let you. 
- Boys, please... Not here. 

222
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,200
Who is my client? 

223
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,880
Take a look at where you're standing, and make a deduction. 

224
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,400
You are to be engaged by the highest in the land, now, for God's sake! 

225
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,920
Put your clothes on! 

226
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,520
SHERLOCK SIGHS 

227
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,320
I'll be mother. 

228
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,120
And there is a whole childhood in a nutshell. 

229
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,920
My employer has a problem. 

230
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,880
A matter has come to light of an extremely delicate and potentially criminal nature, 

231
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,240
- and in this hour of need, dear brother, your name has arisen. 
- Why? 

232
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,440
We have a police force of sorts, even a marginally secret service. 

233
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,040
- Why come to me? 
- People come to you for help, don't they, Mr Holmes? 
- Not to date anyone with a navy. 

234
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,480
This is a matter of the highest security, and therefore of trust. 

235
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,480
- You don't trust your own secret service? 
- Naturally not. 

236
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
They all spy on people for money. 

237
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,560
I do think we have a timetable. 

238
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,200
Yes, of course. Erm... 

239
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,000
What do you know about this woman? 

240
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,880
Nothing whatsoever. 

241
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,800
Then you should be paying more attention. 

242
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,840
MESSAGE TONE 

243
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,880
She's been at the centre of two political scandals in the last year, 

244
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,520
and recently ended the marriage of a prominent novelist 

245
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,600
by having an affair with both participants separately. 

246
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,440
You know I don't concern myself with trivia. 

247
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,760
Who is she? 

248
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,920
Irene Adler. 

249
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,360
Professionally known as "The Woman". 

250
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,720
Professionally? 

251
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,240
There are many names for what she does. She prefers "dominatrix". 

252
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,960
- Dominatrix. 
- Don't be alarmed. 

253
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,440
It's to do with sex. 

254
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,840
Sex doesn't alarm me. 

255
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,520
How would you know? 

256
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
She provides, shall we say, recreational scolding 

257
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,120
for those who enjoy that sort of thing 

258
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
and are prepared to pay for it. 

259
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,880
These are all from her website. 

260
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,360
And I assume this Adler woman has some compromising photographs. 

261
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,840
You're very quick, Mr Holmes. 

262
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,680
Hardly a difficult deduction. Photographs of whom? 

263
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,000
A person of significance to my employer. 

264
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,160
- We'd prefer not to say any more at this time. 
- You can't tell us anything? 

265
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,640
I can tell you it's a young person. 

266
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,440
A young female person. 

267
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,440
How many photographs? 

268
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,360
A considerable number, apparently. 

269
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,720
- Do Miss Adler and this young female person appear in these photographs together? 
- Yes. 

270
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,040
- I assume in a number of compromising scenarios? 
- An imaginative range, we are assured. 

271
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,720
John, you might want to put that cup back in your saucer now. 

272
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,080
- Can you help us, Mr Holmes? 
- How? 
- Will you take the case? 

273
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,120
What case? 

274
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,920
Pay her, now and in full. 

275
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,240
As Miss Adler remarks in her masthead, know when you are beaten. 

276
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,160
She doesn't want anything. 

277
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,600
She got in touch. 

278
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,080
She informed us that the photographs existed. 

279
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,840
She indicated that she had no intention to use them 

280
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,760
to extort either money or favour. 

281
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,960
Oh, a power play. 

282
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,960
A power play with the most powerful family in Britain. 

283
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,520
Now that is a dominatrix. Ooh, this is getting rather fun, isn't it. 

284
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,560
- Sherlock... 
- Hmm. Where is she? 

285
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,240
- In London, currently. She's staying... 
- Text me the details, I'll be in touch by the end of the day. 

286
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,280
- Do you really think you'll have news by then? 
- No, I think I'll have the photographs. 

287
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,920
One can only hope you're as good as you seem to think. 

288
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,000
- I'll need some equipment, of course. 
- Anything you require, I'll have it sent... 

289
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,440
- Can I have a box of matches? 
- I'm sorry? 
- Or your cigarette lighter, either will do. 

290
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,240
- I don't smoke. 
- No, I know you don't, but your employer does. 

291
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,280
We have kept a lot of people successfully in the dark 

292
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,360
about this little fact, Mr Holmes. 

293
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,560
I'm not the Commonwealth. 

294
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,200
And that's as modest as he gets. 

295
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,360
Pleasure to meet you. 

296
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,640
Laters! 

297
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,600
OK, the smoking, how did you know? 

298
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,080
The evidence was right under your nose, John, 

299
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,800
as ever you see, but do not observe. 

300
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,960
- Observe what? 
- The ashtray. 

301
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,200
WATSON LAUGHS 

302
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,240
SHERLOCK CHUCKLES 

303
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,960
SOUND OF FLASHBULBS 

304
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Kate? 

305
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,000
We're going to have a visitor. 

306
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,480
I'll need a bit of time to get ready. 

307
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,160
A long time? 

308
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,240
Hmm...ages. 

309
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,600
What are you doing? 

310
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,920
I'm going to into battle, John. 

311
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,440
I need the right armour. 

312
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,720
No. 

313
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,880
Nah. 

314
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,320
Works for me. 

315
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Everything works on you. 

316
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,120
So, what's the plan? 

317
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
We know her address. 

318
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,560
- We just ring her doorbell? 
- Exactly. Just here, please. 
- You didn't even change your clothes. 

319
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,640
Then it's time to add a splash of colour. 

320
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,200
Are we here? 

321
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,440
Two streets away, but this will do. 

322
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,720
- For what? 
- Punch me in the face. 

323
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,200
Shade? 

324
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,160
Blood. 

325
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,600
- Punch you? 
- Yes, punch me, in the face. Didn't you hear me? 

326
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,960
I always hear "punch me" when you speak but it's usually sub-text. 

327
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,920
Oh, for God's sakes! 

328
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,360
Thank you, that was... 

329
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,440
OK, I think we're done now, John! 

330
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,320
You want to remember, Sherlock, I was a soldier. I killed people. 

331
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,600
- You were a doctor! 
- I had bad days! 

332
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,520
What are you going to wear? 

333
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,120
- My battle dress. 
- Oh, lucky boy. 

334
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,600
BUZZER 

335
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,400
BELL RINGS 

336
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
Hello? 

337
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Oh, very sorry to disturb you, um, I've just been attacked, um, 

338
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,960
um, and I think they, they took my wallet 

339
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,320
and, um, and my phone. 

340
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,400
Um, please could you help me? 

341
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
I can phone the police, if you want? 

342
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,600
Thank you. Could you, please? Would you mind if I just waited here, just until they come? 

343
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,440
Thank you, thank you so much. 

344
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
BUZZER 

345
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,120
Thank you. Oh. 

346
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,320
I saw it all happen. 

347
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,880
- It's OK, I'm a doctor. Have you got a first aid kit? 
- In the kitchen. Please. 

348
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,240
- Thank you. 
- Thank you. 

349
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
Hello, sorry to hear you've been hurt. 

350
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,080
- I don't think Kate caught your name? 
- I'm so sorry, I'm... 

351
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,600
It's always hard to remember an alias when you've had a fright. Isn't it? 

352
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,680
Well, there now. 

353
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,400
We're both defrocked... 

354
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,560
..Mr Sherlock Holmes. 

355
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,600
- Miss Adler, I presume. 
- Look at those cheekbones. 

356
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,160
I could cut myself slapping that face. 

357
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,040
Would you like me to try? 

358
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,840
Right, this should do it. 

359
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,600
I've missed something, haven't I? 

360
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,000
Please, sit down. Or if you'd like some tea, I can call the maid. 

361
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
- I had some at the Palace. 
- I know. 
- Clearly. 

362
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,200
I had a tea too, at the Palace. If anyone's interested. 

363
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,200
Do you know the big problem with a disguise, Mr Holmes? 

364
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,640
However hard you try, it's always a self-portrait. 

365
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,600
You think I'm a vicar with a bleeding face? 

366
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,720
No, I think you're damaged, delusional 

367
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,880
and believe in a higher power. In your case, it's yourself. 

368
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,280
Hmm, and somebody loves you. 

369
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,440
If I had to punch that face, I'd avoid your nose and teeth, too. 

370
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,880
Ha-ha! Could you put something on, please? 

371
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,120
- Er, anything at all. A napkin? 
- Why? Are you feeling exposed? 

372
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,680
I don't think John knows where to look. 

373
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,480
No, I think he knows exactly where. 

374
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,680
I'm not sure about you. 

375
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,600
If I was to look at naked women, I'd borrow John's laptop. 

376
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,800
- You do borrow my laptop. 
- I confiscate it. 

377
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,640
Never mind, we've got better things to talk about. Now, tell me, I need to know - 

378
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,320
how was it done? 

379
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,960
What? 

380
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,080
The hiker with the bashed-in head - how was he killed? 

381
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,040
That's not why I'm here. 

382
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,200
You're here for the photographs, 

383
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,480
but that's never going to happen and as we're chatting... 

384
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,760
That story's not out. How do you know about it? 

385
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,560
- I know one of the policemen. Well, I know what he likes. 
- Oh. 

386
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,040
And you...like policemen? 

387
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,920
I like detective stories. And detectives. 

388
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,080
Brainy is the new sexy. 

389
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,600
The position of the car relative to the hiker, 

390
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,160
that and the fact that the death blow was to the back of the head, that's all you need to know. 

391
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,280
- OK, tell me, how was he murdered? 
- He wasn't. 

392
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,960
- You don't think it was murder? 
- I know it wasn't. 
- How? 
- The same way 

393
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,560
I know the victim was a sportsman, recently returned from foreign travel 

394
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,480
- and that the photographs I'm looking for are in this room. 
- OK, but how? 

395
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,400
So they are in this room. Thank you. 

396
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,920
John, man the door, let no-one in. 

397
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,840
Two men alone in the countryside, several yards apart and one car. 

398
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,480
- Oh, I,... I thought you were looking for the photos now. 
- No, no. 

399
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,120
Looking takes ages, I'm just going to find them, 

400
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,760
but you're clever and we've got a moment, so let's pass the time. Two men, a car, nobody else. 

401
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,240
Driver's trying to fix his engine. 

402
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,400
Getting nowhere. 

403
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,560
And the hiker is taking a moment, looking at the sky. 

404
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,360
Watching the birds? Any moment now, something is going to happen. What? 

405
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,160
- The hiker is going to die. 
- No, that's the result. What's going to happen? 

406
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,840
- I don't understand. 
- Oh, well try to. 

407
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,560
- Why? 
- Because you cater to the whims of the pathetic 

408
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,480
and take your clothes off to make an impression. Stop boring me and think. It's the new sexy. 

409
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,200
- The car's going to backfire. There's 
- going to be a loud noise. 
- So what? 

410
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,640
Noises are important. They can tell you everything. For instance... 

411
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,720
BEEPING 

412
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,600
Thank you. 

413
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,040
On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother would look towards her child. 

414
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,840
Amazing how fire exposes our priorities. 

415
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,360
I really hope you don't have a baby in here. 

416
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,680
All right, John, you can turn it off now. 

417
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,640
I said you can turn it off now! 

418
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,720
Give me a minute! 

419
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,040
Thank you. 

420
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,920
Hmm. 

421
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,000
You should always use gloves with these things, you know. 

422
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,600
Heaviest oil deposit is always on the first key used, 

423
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:10,120
that's a 3, but after that, the sequence is impossible to read. I see it's a six digit code. 

424
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,760
It can't be your birthday, no disrespect, but you were born in the '80s and 8's barely used, so... 

425
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,680
I'd tell you the code right now, but you know what? I already have. 

426
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,440
Think. 

427
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,120
Hands behind your head, on the floor, keep it still! 

428
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,040
- Sorry, Sherlock. 
- Miss Adler, on the floor! 

429
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,520
- Don't you want me on the floor, too? 
- No, sir, I want you to open the safe. 

430
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,480
American. Interesting. Why would you care? 

431
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,840
- Sir, the safe, now, please. 
- I don't know the code. 
- We've been listening, she said she told you. 

432
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,880
- If you've been listening, you'll know she didn't. 
- I assume I missed something. From your reputation, 

433
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,440
I assume you didn't, Mr Holmes. 

434
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,640
She's the one who knows the code, ask her! 

435
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,680
Yes, sir, she also knows the code that calls the police and sets off the burglar alarm. 

436
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,880
- I've learned not to trust her. 
- Mr Holmes doesn't... 
- Shut up! 

437
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,520
One more word out of you, 

438
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,640
just one and I will decorate that wall with the insides of your head. 

439
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,280
That, for me, will not be a hardship. 

440
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,480
- Mr Archer, at the count of three, shoot Dr Watson. 
- What? 

441
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,680
- I don't know the code. 
- One. 

442
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,000
- I don't know the code. 
- Two. 
- She didn't tell me, I don't know it! 

443
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,320
I'm prepared to believe you, any second now. 

444
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,560
- Three! 
- No, stop! 

445
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,120
BEEPING 

446
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,960
BEEPING 

447
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,200
SAFE UNLOCKS 

448
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,440
Thank you, Mr Holmes. Open it, please. 

449
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,760
Vatican cameos! 

450
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,680
- Do you mind? 
- Not at all. 

451
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,920
- He's dead. 
- Thank you. You were very observant. 
- Observant? 

452
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,000
- I'm flattered. 
- Don't be. 
- Flattered? 

453
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,680
There'll be more of them, they'll be keeping an eye on the building. 

454
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,800
- We should call the police. 
- Yes. 

455
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,360
- On their way. 
- For God's sake! 

456
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,560
Oh, shut up, it's quick. 

457
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,360
Check the rest of the house, see how they got in. 

458
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,480
- Well, that's the knighthood in the bag. 
- Oh, and that's mine. 

459
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,760
- All the photographs are on here, I presume? 
- I have copies, of course. 
- No, you don't. 

460
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,240
You'll have permanently disabled any kind of uplink or connection. 

461
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,640
Unless the contents of this phone are unique, you couldn't sell them. 

462
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,320
- Who said I'm selling? 
- Well, why would they be interested? 

463
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:21,120
- Whatever's on the phone, it's clearly not just photographs. 
- That camera-phone is my life, Mr Holmes. 

464
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,360
I'd die before I let you take it. It's my protection. 

465
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,560
- Sherlock! 
- It was. 

466
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,840
- Must have come in this way. 
- Clearly. 

467
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,280
It's all right, she's just out cold. 

468
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Oh, God knows she's used to that. There's a back door. Better check it, Dr Watson. 

469
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,240
Sure. 

470
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,240
You're very calm. 

471
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,080
- Well, your booby trap did just kill a man. 
- He would have killed me. 

472
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,800
It was self defence in advance. 

473
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,400
What is that?! What? 

474
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,440
Give it to me. 

475
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,560
Now. Give it to me. 

476
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,760
No. 

477
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,120
- Give it to me. 
- Argh! No. 

478
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
Oh, for goodness sake! 

479
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,800
Drop it. 

480
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,400
I...said...drop it! 

481
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,360
Ah, thank you, dear. 

482
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,280
Now, tell that sweet little posh thing the pictures are safe with me. 

483
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,240
They're not for blackmail, just for insurance. 

484
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,320
Besides, I might want to see her again. 

485
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,160
Oh, no no no no no. 

486
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,960
It's been a pleasure. 

487
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,920
Don't spoil it. 

488
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,600
This is how I want you to remember me, 

489
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,080
the woman who beat you. 

490
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,720
Goodnight, Mr Sherlock Holmes. 

491
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,480
- Jesus! What are you doing? 
- He'll sleep for a few hours. 

492
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,200
- Make sure he doesn't choke on his own vomit, it makes for a very unattractive corpse. 
- What's this? 

493
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,840
- What have you given him? Sherlock? 
- He'll be fine. 

494
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,080
- I've used it on loads of my friends. 
- Sherlock, can you hear me? 

495
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,880
- You know, I was wrong about him. He did know where to look. 
- For what? What are you talking about? 

496
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,520
- The key-code to my safe. 
- What was it? 

497
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,320
Shall I tell him? 

498
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
My measurements. 

499
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,120
SIREN WAILS 

500
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,640
SIRENS WAIL 

501
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,200
Got it! 

502
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,880
Oh, ssh ssh no, don't get up, I'll do the talking. 

503
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:02,080
So, the car's about to backfire and the hiker, he's staring at the sky. 

504
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,360
You said he could be watching birds, but he wasn't, was he? 

505
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,080
He was watching another kind of flying thing. 

506
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,400
The car backfires and the hiker turns to look... 

507
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,480
..which was his big mistake. 

508
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,960
By the time the driver looks up, the hiker is already dead. He doesn't see what killed him 

509
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,560
because it's already being washed downstream. 

510
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,000
An accomplished sportsman recently returned from foreign travel with... 

511
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,800
a boomerang. 

512
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,000
You got that from one look? 

513
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,320
Definitely the new sexy. 

514
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
I... 

515
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,760
I... 

516
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,880
Hush, now. 

517
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,600
It's OK. 

518
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,400
I'm only returning your coat. 

519
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,440
John? 

520
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,080
John! 

521
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,200
- You OK? 
- How did I get here? 

522
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,560
I don't suppose you remember much, you weren't making a lot of sense. 

523
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,960
Oh, I should warn you, I think Lestrade filmed you on his phone. 

524
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,120
- Where is she? 
- Where's who? 
- The woman, that woman. 
- What woman? 

525
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,280
- The Woman! The Woman, woman! 
- Oh, Irene Adler? 

526
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,480
She got away, no-one saw her. She wasn't here, Sherlock. 

527
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,480
What are you? What? No, no, no. No. Back to bed. 

528
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,040
You'll be fine in the morning. Just sleep. 

529
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,280
Of course I'll be fine, I am fine. I'm absolutely fine. 

530
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,440
Yes, you're great. Now, I'll be next door if you need me. 

531
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,280
- Why would I need you? 
- No reason at all.

00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,760
- The photographs are perfectly safe. 
- In the hands of a fugitive sex worker? 

534
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,800
She's not interested in blackmail. 

535
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,880
She wants...protection, for some reason. 

536
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,320
I take it you've stood down the police investigation into the shooting at her house? 

537
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,560
How can we do anything while she has the photographs? Our hands are tied. 

538
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,920
She'd applaud your choice of words. 

539
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,440
You see how this works? The camera-phone is her get out of jail free card. 

540
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,440
You have to leave her alone. Treat her like royalty, Mycroft. 

541
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,840
Though not the way she treats royalty.

What was that? 

544
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,840
- Text. 
- But what was that noise? 

545
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,320
Did you know there were other people after her too 

546
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
before you sent John and I in there? 

547
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,000
- CIA trained killers, I think. 
- Thanks for that. 

548
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,680
It's a disgrace, sending your little brother into danger like that. 

549
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,320
Family is all we have in the end, Mycroft Holmes! 

550
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,560
- Oh, shut up, Mrs Hudson! 
- Mycroft!! 

551
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,440
- Apologies. 
- Thank you. 
- Though do in fact shut up.

Oh, it's a bit rude, that noise, isn't it? 

554
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,280
There's nothing you can do and nothing she will do, as far as I can see. 

555
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,600
I can put maximum surveillance on her. 

556
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Why bother? You can follow her on Twitter. 

557
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,560
I believe her user name is The Whip Hand. 

558
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,000
Most amusing. Excuse me. Hello? 

559
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,440
Why does your phone make that noise? 

560
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,120
- What noise? 
- That noise, the one it just made. 

561
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
It's a text alert, means I've got a text. 

562
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,480
Hmm. Your texts don't usually make that noise. 

563
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,920
Well, somebody got hold of the phone and apparently as a joke, 

564
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,240
personalised their text alert noise. 

565
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,960
Hmm, so every time they text you... 

566
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,160
- EROTIC MOAN TEXT ALERT 
- It would seem so. 

567
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,320
Could you turn that phone down a bit? At my time of life it's... 

568
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,920
Ahem. 

569
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,680
See I'm wondering who could have got hold of your phone. 

570
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,080
- It would've been in your coat. 
- I'll leave you to your deductions. 

571
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,080
I'm not stupid, you know. 

572
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,000
Where do you get that idea? 

573
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,040
Bond Air is go, that's decided. Check with the Coventry lot. 

574
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,280
Talk later. 

575
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,160
What else does she have? 

576
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,640
Irene Adler. The Americans wouldn't be interested in her 

577
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,320
for a couple of compromising photographs. 

578
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,000
There's more. Much more. 

579
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Something big's coming, isn't it? 

580
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,720
Irene Adler is no longer any concern of yours. 

581
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,560
From now on, you will stay out of this. 

582
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,880
- Oh, will I? 
- Yes, Sherlock. 

583
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,400
You will. 

584
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,240
Now if you'll excuse me, 

585
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,960
I have a long and arduous apology to make to a very old friend. 

586
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,520
Do give her my love. 

587
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,200
HE PLAYS 'GOD SAVE THE QUEEN' 

588
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,480
Lovely, Sherlock. That was lovely. 

589
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,800
- Hmm, marvellous. 
- Yes, very good. 

590
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,760
I wish you could have worn the antlers. 

591
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,240
- Some things are best left to the imagination, Mrs Hudson. 
- Mrs H? 

592
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,440
- No thank you, Sarah. 
- Er, no, no, he's not good with names. 

593
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,640
No, I can get this. 

594
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,560
Sarah was the doctor, then there was the one with the spots, 

595
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,000
then the one with the nose and then, who was after the boring teacher? 

596
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,200
- Nobody. 
- Jeanette! Ah, process of elimination. Oh, dear Lord. 

597
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Hello, everyone. It said on the door to come up. 

598
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,240
- Hello, Molly. 
- Hello, Molly! 

599
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,840
Everybody saying hello to each other, how wonderful! 

600
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,280
- Let me, er... Holy Mary! 
- Wow! 

601
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,880
- So we're having Christmas drinkies? 
- No stopping them, apparently. 

602
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,800
It's the one day of the year where the boys have to be nice to me, 

603
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,920
so it's almost worth it. 

604
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,000
- John? 
- Hmm? 
- The counter on your blog still says 1895. 
- Oh, no, Christmas is cancelled(!) 

605
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,320
- And you've got a photograph of me wearing that hat! 
- People like it. 

606
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,800
- No, they don't. What people? 
- How's the hip? 

607
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,080
Oh, it's atrocious, but thanks for asking. 

608
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,920
I've seen much worse, but then I do post-mortems. 

609
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,200
- Oh, God, sorry. 
- Don't make jokes, Molly. 

610
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,440
- No, sorry. 
- Here you are. 
- Thank you. I wasn't expecting to see you. 

611
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,320
I thought you were in Dorset for Christmas? 

612
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,720
First thing in the morning, me and the wife, back together, sorted. 

613
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,640
No, she's sleeping with a PE teacher. 

614
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,040
- And John, I hear you're off to your sister's? 
- Yeah. 

615
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,280
Sherlock was complaining. Saying. 

616
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,160
First time ever, she's cleaned up her act, off the booze. 

617
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,600
- Nope. 
- Shut up, Sherlock! 

618
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,720
- I see you've got a new boyfriend, Molly. You're serious about him. 
- Sorry, what? 

619
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,680
- You're seeing him tonight, giving him a gift. 
- Take a day off. 

620
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,560
- Shut up. Have a drink. 
- Surely you see the perfectly wrapped present in the bag. 

621
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,280
The others are slapdash. It's for someone special. 

622
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,440
The shade of red echoes her lipstick - an unconscious association, 

623
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,040
or one she's deliberately trying to encourage. Either way, Miss Hooper has love on her mind. 

624
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,840
That she's serious about him is clear from the fact she's giving him a gift. 

625
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,120
It suggests long-term hopes. 

626
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,520
That she's seeing him tonight is evident from her make-up and clothes. 

627
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,680
Obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts. 

628
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,640
You always say such horrible things. 

629
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,560
Every time. Always. 

630
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,080
Always. 

631
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,360
I am sorry. Forgive me. 

632
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,520
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.

Fifty seven of those texts, the ones I've heard.

Thrilling that you've been counting. 

640

Excuse me. 

641
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,000
What's up, Sherlock? 

642
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
- I said excuse me. 
- Do you ever reply?

Have they passed a new law?

I think you're going to find Irene Adler tonight.

00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,520
We already know where she is. 

648
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,240
As you were kind enough to point out, it hardly matters. 

649
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,480
No, I mean you're going to find her dead. 

650
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,840
- You OK? 
- Yes. 

651
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,400
The only one who fitted the description. 

652
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,520
Had her brought here, your home from home. 

653
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,440
You didn't need to come in, Molly. 

654

It's OK, everyone else is busy with... Christmas.

The face is a bit sort of bashed-up, so it might be a bit difficult. 

656
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,960
- That's her, isn't it? 
- Show me the rest of her. 

657
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,320
That's her. 

658
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,360
Thank you, Miss Hooper. 

659
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,200
Who is she? How did Sherlock recognise her from... not her face? 

660
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,800
- Just the one. 
- Why? 
- Merry Christmas. 

661
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,600
Smoking indoors, isn't there one of those... one of those law things? 

662
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,400
We're in a morgue. 

663
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,480
There's only so much damage you can do. 

664
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,680
How did you know she was dead? 

665
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,320
She had an item in her possession, one she said her life depended on. 

666
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,120
- She chose to give it up. 
- Where is this item now? 

667
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,800
Look at them. 

668
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,320
They all care so much. 

669
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,760
Do you ever wonder if there's something wrong with us? 

670
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,640
All lives end, all hearts are broken. 

671
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,200
Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock. 

672
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,880
This is low tar. 

673
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,200
Well, you barely knew her. 

674
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,760
Huh. 

675
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,560
Merry Christmas, Mycroft. 

676
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,680
And a happy new year. 

677
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,280
He's on his way. Have you found anything? 

678
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,800
- No. Did he take the cigarette? 
- Yes. 
- Shit! 

679
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,040
- He's coming, ten minutes. 
- There's nothing in the bedroom. 

680
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,680
It looks like he's clean, we've tried all the usual places. 

681
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,000
Are you sure tonight's a danger night? 

682
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,640
No, but then I never am. You have to stay with him, John. 

683
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,320
I've got plans. 

684
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,640
No. 

685
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,040
Mycroft? 

686
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,080
I am really sorry. 

687
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,520
- You know my friends are so wrong about you. 
- Hmm? 

688
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,640
- You're a great boyfriend. 
- OK, that's good. 

689
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,840
- I always thought I was great. 
- Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man. 

690
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,480
Oh, Jeanette, please. 

691
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,000
No, I mean it. It's heart-warming. You'll do anything for him. 

692
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,680
And he can't even tell your girlfriends apart! 

693
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,760
I'll do anything for you, just tell me what it is I'm not doing. 

694
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,400
Don't make me compete with Sherlock Holmes! 

695
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,760
I'll walk your dog. There, I've said it, I'll even walk your dog. 

696
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,960
- I don't have a dog! 
- No, because that was the last one. 

697
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,880
- OK. 
- Jesus! 
- I'll call you. 
- No! 
- OK. 

698
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,400
That really wasn't very good, was it? 

699
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,720
Oh, hi. 

700
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,560
You OK? 

701
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,760
I hope you didn't mess up my sock index this time! 

702
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,160
VIOLIN PLAYS 

703
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,960
Lovely tune, Sherlock, haven't heard that one before. 

704
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,520
Ahem. Composing? 

705
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,760
Helps me to think. 

706
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,520
What are you thinking about? 

707
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,560
The count on your blog is still stuck at 1895. 

708
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,800
Yes. Faulty, can't seem to fix it. 

709
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,560
Faulty, or you've been hacked and it's a message. 

710
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,480
Hmm? 

711
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,240
Just faulty. 

712
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,000
Right. 

713
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,320
Right. 

714
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,560
Well, I'm going out for a bit. 

715
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,360
Listen, has he ever had any kind of girlfriend, 

716
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,480
boyfriend, a relationship, ever? 

717
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,120
I don't know. 

718
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,480
How can we not know? 

719
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,800
He's Sherlock. 

720
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,360
How will we ever know what goes on in that funny old head? 

721
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,200
Right. See you. 

722
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,240
- John? 
- Yeah? Hello? 

723
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,440
- Hello. 
- So, any plans for new year tonight? 

724
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,840
Um, er... nothing fixed. 

725
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,440
Nothing I couldn't heartlessly abandon. 

726
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,720
- You have any ideas? 
- One. 

727
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,200
You know, Mycroft could just phone me, 

728
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,680
if he didn't have this bloody stupid power complex. 

729
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,720
Couldn't we just go to a cafe? 

730
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,840
Sherlock doesn't follow me everywhere. 

731
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,480
Through there. 

732
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,920
He's on his way. 

733
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,800
You were right, he thinks it's Mycroft. 

734
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,240
He's writing sad music. 

735
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,440
Doesn't eat, barely talks, 

736
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,640
only to correct the television. 

737
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,640
I'd say he was heart-broken, but, er, well he's Sherlock. 

738
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,880
He does all that anyway. 

739
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,360
Hello, Dr Watson. 

740
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,480
Tell him you're alive. 

741
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,280
He'd come after me. 

742
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,080
I'll come after you if you don't. 

743
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,920
Hmm, I believe you. 

744
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,160
You were dead on a slab. 

745
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,960
It was definitely you. 

746
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,960
DNA tests are only as good as the records you keep. 

747
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,800
- And I bet you know the record keeper. 
- I know what he likes. 

748
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,720
And I needed to disappear. 

749
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,640
Then how come I can see you and I don't even want to? 

750
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,080
Look, I made a mistake, 

751
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,520
I sent something to Sherlock for safekeeping, now I need it back. 

752
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,040
- I need your help. 
- No. 
- It's for his own safety. 

753
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,400
So is this. Tell him you're alive. 

754
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,560
- I can't. 
- Fine, I'll tell him 

755
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,440
- and I still won't help you. 
- What do I say? 

756
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,360
What do you normally say?! You've texted him a lot! 

757
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,640
- Just the usual stuff. 
- There is no usual in this case. 

758
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,680
"Good morning. I like your funny hat. 

759
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,600
"I'm sad tonight, let's have dinner. 

760
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,440
"Hmm, you look sexy on Crimewatch, let's have dinner. 

761
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,600
"I'm not hungry. 

762
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,480
"Let's have dinner". 

763
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,320
- You flirted with Sherlock Holmes? 
- At him. He never replies. 

764
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,680
No, Sherlock always replies to everything. 

765
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,800
He's Mr Punchline. 

766
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,520
He will outlive God trying to have the last word. 

767
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,640
Does that make me special? 

768
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,600
- I don't know, maybe. 
- Are you jealous? 

769
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,320
- We're not a couple. 
- Yes, you are. 

770
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,880
There, "I'm not dead. 

771
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,120
"Let's have dinner". 

772
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,280
Who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes? But for the record, 

773
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,040
if anyone out there still cares, I'm not actually gay. 

774
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,840
Well, I am. Look at us both. 

775
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,240
EROTIC MOAN TEXT ALERT 

776
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,120
I don't think so, do you? 

777
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,560
- Stop it! 
- Stop it! 

778
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,800
Sherlock! 

779
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,800
- Oh, Sherlock, Sherlock... 
- Don't snivel, Mrs Hudson, 

780
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,960
it'll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet. 

781
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,480
What a tender world that would be. 

782
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,040
Oh, please, Sherlock... 

783
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,400
I believe that you have something that we want, Mr Holmes. 

784
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,480
Then why don't you ask for it? 

785
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,760
Oh, I've been asking this one, she doesn't seem to know anything. 

786
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,640
But you know what I'm asking for, don't you, Mr Holmes? 

787
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,000
I believe I do. 

788
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,960
Please, help. 

789
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,600
First get rid of your boys. 

790
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,520
- Why? 
- I dislike being outnumbered, 

791
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,840
it makes for too much stupid in the room. 

792
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,480
- You two, go to the car. 
- Then get into the car and drive away. 

793
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,880
Don't try to trick me, you know who I am, it doesn't work. 

794
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,960
Next, you can stop pointing that gun at me. 

795
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,800
So you can point a gun at me? 

796
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,920
I'm unarmed. 

797
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,280
- Mind if I check? 
- Oh, I insist. 

798
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,560
Argh! 

799
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,200
Moron. 

800
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,000
- Oh, thank you. 
- You're all right now, you're all right. 

801
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,680
- Jeez, what the hell is happening? 
- Mrs Hudson has been attacked by an American, 

802
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,840
I'm restoring balance to the universe. 

803
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,400
Mrs Hudson, my God, are you all right? 

804
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,480
Jesus, what have they done to you? 

805
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,240
Oh, I'm just being so silly. 

806
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,880
Take her downstairs and look after her. 

807
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,240
It's all right, I'll have a look at that. 

808
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,560
I'm fine, I'm fine. 

809
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,800
- Are you going to tell me what's going on? 
- I expect so, now go. 

810
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,600
Lestrade? 

811
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,440
We've had a break-in at Baker Street. 

812
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,880
Send your least irritating officers and an ambulance. 

813
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,000
Oh, no, no, no, we're fine. 

814
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,320
No, it's the burglar, he's got himself rather badly injured. 

815
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,000
Oh, a few broken ribs, fractured skull, suspected punctured lung... 

816
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,520
He fell out of a window. 

817
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,760
Oh, it stings. 

818
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,360
Oh, that was right on my bins. 

819
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,160
GROANING OUTSIDE 

820
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,080
And exactly how many times did he fall out the window? 

821
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,480
It's all a bit of a blur, Detective Inspector. 

822
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,200
I lost count. 

823
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,680
She'll have to sleep upstairs in our flat tonight, 

824
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,080
we need to look after her. 

825
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,680
- No... 
- She's fine. 
- No, she's not, look at her. 

826
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,320
She's got to take some time away from Baker Street. 

827
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,040
She can stay with her sister, doctor's orders. 

828
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,480
- Don't be absurd. 
- She's in shock, for God's sake, 

829
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,600
and all over some stupid camera-phone - where is it anyway? 

830
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,920
Safest place I know. 

831
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,040
You left it in the pocket of your second best dressing gown, you clot! 

832
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,920
I managed to sneak it out when they thought I was having a cry. 

833
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,640
Thank you. 

834
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,440
Shame on you, John Watson. 

835
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,600
- Shame on me? 
- Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street? 

836
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,440
England would fall. 

837
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,120
Where is it now? 

838
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,480
Where no-one will look. 

839
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,560
Whatever's on that phone is more than just pictures. 

840
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,200
Yes, it is. 

841
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,840
So, she's alive then. 

842
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,520
How are we feeling about that? 

843
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,600
BIG BEN CHIMES 

844
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,000
Happy New Year, John. 

845
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,960
Do you think you'll be seeing her again? 

846
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,640
HE PLAYS 'AULD LANG SYNE' 

847
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,720
TEXT ALERT 

848
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,000
- Is that a phone? 
- It's a camera-phone. 

849
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,840
- And you're x-raying it? 
- Yes, I am. 

850
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,600
- Whose phone is it? 
- A woman's. 

851
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,040
Your girlfriend? 

852
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,480
She's my girlfriend because I'm x-raying her possessions? 

853
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,600
- Well, we all do silly things! 
- Yes... 

854
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,200
..they do, don't they? 

855
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,320
Very silly. 

856
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,520
She sent this to my address. 

857
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,920
- She loves to play games. 
- She does? 

858
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,840
Hey, Sherlock... 

859
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,520
We have a client. 

860
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,360
What, in your bedroom? 

861
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,240
Oh. 

862
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,920
So, who's after you? 

863
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,000
- People who want to kill me. 
- Who's that? 

864
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,920
Killers. 

865
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,320
It would help if you were a tiny bit more specific. 

866
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,880
- So you faked your own death to get ahead of them? 
- It worked for a while. 

867
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,120
- Except you let John know you're alive, therefore me. 
- I knew you'd keep my secret. 

868
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,520
You couldn't. 

869
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,160
But you did, didn't you? 

870
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,120
Where's my camera-phone? 

871
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,520
It's not here. 

872
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,960
We're not stupid. 

873
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,680
What have you done with it? If they've guessed, they'll be watching you. 

874
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,000
Then they'll know I took a safety deposit box 

875
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,080
at a bank on the Strand a few months ago. 

876
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,160
I need it. 

877
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,520
Well, we can't just go and get it, can we? 

878
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,920
Molly Hooper, she could collect it, take it to Barts. 

879
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,120
Then one of your homeless network could bring it here, leave it in the cafe, 

880
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,680
one of the boys downstairs could bring it up the back. 

881
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,240
Very good, John, excellent plan, full of intelligent precautions. 

882
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,120
Thank you. So, why don't I phone... 

883
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,760
So, what do you keep on here? 

884
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,560
In general, I mean? 

885
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,680
Pictures, information, anything I might find useful. 

886
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,960
- For blackmail? 
- For protection. 

887
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,040
I make my way in the world, I misbehave. 

888
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,440
I like to know people will be on my side exactly when I need them to be. 

889
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,400
- So how do you acquire this information? 
- I told you - I misbehave. 

890
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,280
- But you've acquired something more danger than protection. Do you know what it is? 
- Yes... 

891
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,920
..but I don't understand it. 

892
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,640
I assumed. Show me. 

893
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,160
The passcode. 

894
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,760
It's not working. 

895
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,200
No, because it's a duplicate I had made 

896
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,640
into which you just entered the numbers 1058. 

897
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:52,800
I assumed you'd choose something more specific than that, but thanks, anyway. 

898
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,200
I told you that camera-phone was my life. 

899
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,880
I know when it's in my hand. 

900
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,240
Oh, you're rather good. 

901
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,240
You're not so bad. 

902
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,480
Hamish. 

903
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:22,760
John Hamish Watson, just if you were looking for baby names. 

904
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,640
There was a man, an MOD official and I knew what he liked. 

905
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,400
One of the things he liked was showing off. 

906
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,920
He told me this email was going to save the world. 

907
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,800
He didn't know but I photographed it - he was a bit tied up at the time. 

908
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,920
It's a bit small on that screen, can you read it? 

909
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,200
- Yes. 
- Code, obviously. 

910
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,360
I had one of the country's best cryptographers take a look, 

911
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,160
though he was mostly upside down, as I recall. 

912
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,320
Couldn't figure it out. 

913
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,720
What can you do, Mr Holmes? 

914
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,920
Go on, impress a girl. 

915
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,640
There's a margin for error, 

916
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:20,760
but I'm pretty sure there's a 747 leaving Heathrow tomorrow at 6.30 for Baltimore. 

917
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,560
Apparently it's going to save the world, I'm not sure how, 

918
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,960
but give me a moment, I've only been on the case eight seconds. 

919
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,440
Oh, come on, it's not code, these are seats on a jet. 

920
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,760
Look, no 'I' because it can be mistaken for one. 

921
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,520
No letters past 'K' - the width of the plane is the limit. 

922
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,800
The numbers always appear not in sequence, 

923
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:43,000
but the letters have little runs of sequence families and couples sitting together. 

924
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,360
Only a Jumbo's wide enough for a letter 'K' or rows past 55, so there's always an upstairs. 

925
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,640
A row 13 eliminates superstitious airlines. 

926
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,880
The style of the flight number, '007', eliminates a few more. 

927
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,720
Assuming a British point of origin because of the original source, 

928
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,960
and assuming the crisis is imminent, the only flight that matches 

929
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:05,040
all the criteria and departs within the week is the 6.30 to Baltimore tomorrow from Heathrow. 

930
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,120
Please don't feel obliged to tell me that was amazing, 

931
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,720
John's expressed that in every possible variant available in English. 

932
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,200
I would have you right here, on this desk, 

933
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,400
until you begged for mercy twice. 

934
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,160
John, can you check those flight schedules, see if I'm right? 

935
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,080
I'm on it, yeah. 

936
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,280
I've never begged for mercy in my life. 

937
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,920
Twice. 

938
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,120
Yeah, you're right, flight double 'o' seven. 

939
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,520
- What did you say? 
- You're right. 

940
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,560
No, what did you say after that? 

941
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,280
Double 'o' seven, flight double 'o' seven. 

942
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,240
Double 'o' seven, double 'o' seven... 

943
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,080
Something, double 'o' seven... 

944
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,640
What? 

945
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,040
Double 'o' seven, double 'o' seven, what? 

946
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,680
What, something, what?! 

947
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,520
Bond Air is go. 

948
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,920
Bond Air is go. 

949
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,800
Bond Air is go. 

950
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,440
BLOWS RASPBERRY 

951
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,200
'Bond Air is go, that's decided. 

952
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,320
'Check with the Coventry lot.' 

953
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,160
- Coventry. 
- I've never been. 

954
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,720
Is it nice? 

955
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,480
Where's John? 

956
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,800
He went out, a couple of hours ago. 

957
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,840
I was just talking to him. 

958
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,520
He said you do that. 

959
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,240
What's Coventry got to do with anything? 

960
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,880
It's a story, probably not true - 

961
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,560
in the Second World War, the Allies knew Coventry was going to get bombed, because 

962
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,160
they'd broken the German code, but didn't want the Germans to know that, 

963
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,800
- so they let it happen anyway. 
- Have you ever had anyone? 

964
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,200
I'm sorry? 

965
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,040
And when I say had, I'm being indelicate. 

966
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,520
- I don't understand. 
- I'll be delicate then. 

967
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,840
- Let's have dinner. 
- Why? 

968
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,360
- You might be hungry. 
- I'm not. 
- Good. 

969
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:29,200
Why would I...want to have dinner... 

970
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,200
..if I wasn't hungry? 

971
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,240
Mr Holmes, if it was the end of the world, 

972
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,560
if this was the very last night... 

973
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,440
..would you have dinner with me? 

974
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,800
Sherlock? 

975
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,880
Too late. 

976
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,480
That's not the end of the world, that's Mrs Hudson. 

977
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,400
Sherlock, this man was at the door, is the bell still not working? 

978
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,760
He shot it. 

979
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,920
Have you come to take me away again? 

980
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,760
- Yes, Mr Holmes. 
- Well, I decline. 

981
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,160
I don't think you do. 

982
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,880
There's going to be a bomb on a passenger jet. 

983
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,320
The British and Americans know about it, 

984
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:40,760
but rather than expose their source they're going to let it happen - the plane will blow up. 

985
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,360
Coventry all over again. 

986
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,440
The wheel turns, nothing is ever new. 

987
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,440
Well, you're looking all better. 

988
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,280
How you feeling? 

989
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,680
Like putting a bullet in your brain, sir. 

990
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,120
Hmm. 

991
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,720
They'd pin a medal on me if I did... 

992
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,080
..sir. 

993
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,280
The Coventry conundrum. 

994
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,560
What do you think of my solution? 

995
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,800
The flight of the dead. 

996
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,280
Plane blows up midair, mission accomplished for the terrorists, 

997
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,880
hundreds of casualties, but nobody dies. 

998
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,080
Neat, don't you think? 

999
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,880
You've been stumbling around the fringes of this one for ages. 

1000
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,640
Or were you too bored to notice the pattern? 

1001
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,440
They wouldn't let us see Granddad when he was dead. 

1002
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,360
She's not my real aunt - I know human ash. 

1003
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,920
We ran a similar project with the Germans a while back, 

1004
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:56,560
though I believe one of our passengers didn't make the flight. 

1005
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,080
But that's the deceased for you... 

1006
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,440
..late, in every sense of the word. 

1007
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,080
How is the plane going to fly? 

1008
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,120
Oh, of course, unmanned aircraft, hardly new. 

1009
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,840
It doesn't fly. 

1010
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,440
It will never fly. 

1011
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,600
This entire project is cancelled. 

1012
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,800
The terrorist cells have been informed we know about the bomb. 

1013
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,520
We can't fool them now. 

1014
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,040
We've lost everything. 

1015
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,760
One fragment of one email, 

1016
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:31,160
and months and years of planning - finished. 

1017
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,640
- Your MOD man. 
- That's all it takes. 

1018
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,880
One lonely, naive man, desperate to show off, 

1019
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,560
and a woman clever enough to make him feel special. 

1020
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,920
You should screen your defence people more carefully. 

1021
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,080
I'm not talking about the MOD man, Sherlock, I'm talking about you! 

1022
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,480
The damsel in distress. 

1023
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,080
In the end, are you really so obvious? 

1024
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,960
Because this was textbook. 

1025
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,760
The promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption. 

1026
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,680
Then give him a puzzle and watch him dance. 

1027
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,560
Don't be absurd! 

1028
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,000
Absurd? 

1029
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,680
How quickly did you decipher that email for her? 

1030
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,400
Was it the full minute? 

1031
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,200
Or were you really eager to impress? 

1032
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,720
I think it was less than five seconds. 

1033
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,640
I drove you into her path. 

1034
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,200
I'm sorry, I didn't know. 

1035
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,480
Mr Holmes, I think we need to talk. 

1036
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:43,640
So do I, there are a number of aspects I'm still not clear on. 

1037
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,400
Not you, Junior, you're done now. 

1038
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,880
There's more, loads more. 

1039
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,520
On this phone I've got secrets, pictures 

1040
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,400
and scandals that could topple your whole world. 

1041
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,880
You have no idea how much havoc I can cause and exactly one way to stop me. 

1042
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,960
Unless you want to tell your masters 

1043
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,240
that your biggest security leak is your own little brother. 

1044
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,880
We have people who can get into this. 

1045
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,720
I tested that theory for you. 

1046
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,480
I let Sherlock Holmes try it for six months. 

1047
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,040
Sherlock, dear, tell him what you found when you x-rayed my phone. 

1048
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,880
Four additional units wired inside the casing, 

1049
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,800
I suspect containing acid or a small explosive. 

1050
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,400
Any attempt to open it will burn the hard drive. 

1051
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,520
Explosive. 

1052
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,520
It's more me. 

1053
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,080
Some data is always recoverable. 

1054
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,360
Take that risk. 

1055
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,320
You have a passcode to open this. 

1056
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:45,160
I deeply regret to say, we have people who can extract it from you. 

1057
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,280
- Sherlock? 
- There will be two passcodes - 

1058
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,480
one to open the phone, one to burn the drive. 

1059
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,360
Even under duress, you can't know which one she's given 

1060
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,520
- and there would be no second attempt. 
- He's good, isn't he? 

1061
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,200
I should have him on a leash. 

1062
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,400
In fact, I might. 

1063
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,040
We destroy this, then. No-one has the information. 

1064
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,560
Fine, good idea. 

1065
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,320
Unless there are lives of British citizens 

1066
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,520
depending on the information you burn. 

1067
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,440
- Are there? 
- Telling you would be playing fair. 

1068
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,640
I'm not playing any more. 

1069
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,680
A list of my requests, 

1070
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,560
and some ideas about my protection once they're granted. 

1071
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,080
I'd say it wouldn't blow much of a hole in the wealth of a nation, but then I'd be lying. 

1072
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,080
- I imagine you'd like to sleep on it. 
- Thank you, yes. 

1073
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,480
Too bad. 

1074
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,880
Off you pop and talk to people. 

1075
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,320
You've been very...thorough. 

1076
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,280
I wish our lot were half as good as you. 

1077
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,160
I can't take all the credit, I had a bit of help. 

1078
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,800
Jim Moriarty sends his love. 

1079
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,560
Yes, he's been in touch. 

1080
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,200
Seems desperate for my attention, 

1081
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,480
which I'm sure can be arranged. 

1082
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,840
I had all this stuff and never knew what to do with it. 

1083
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,960
Thank God for the consultant criminal. 

1084
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,840
Gave me a lot of advice about how to play the Holmes boys. 

1085
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,840
Do you know what he calls you? 

1086
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,080
The Ice Man... 

1087
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,520
..and the Virgin. 

1088
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:30,120
Didn't even ask for anything, he just likes to cause trouble - 

1089
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,520
that's my kind of man. 

1090
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,360
And here you are, 

1091
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:38,560
the dominatrix who brought a nation to its knees. 

1092
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,680
Nicely played. 

1093
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,240
No. 

1094
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,720
Sorry? 

1095
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,520
I said no. 

1096
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,040
Very, very close, but no. 

1097
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,880
You got carried away. 

1098
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,560
The game was too elaborate, you were enjoying yourself too much. 

1099
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,400
There's no such thing as too much. 

1100
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,800
Oh, enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine. 

1101
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,080
Craving the distraction of the game, I sympathise, but sentiment? 

1102
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,800
Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side. 

1103
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,560
Sentiment? What are you talking about? 

1104
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,040
You. 

1105
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,800
Oh, dear God. 

1106
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,200
Look at the poor man. 

1107
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,280
You don't actually think I was interested in you? 

1108
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,000
Why? 

1109
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,360
Because you're the great Sherlock Holmes, 

1110
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,560
the clever detective in the funny hat? 

1111
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,000
No. 

1112
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,680
Because I took your pulse. 

1113
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,240
Elevated. 

1114
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,160
Your pupils dilated. 

1115
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,040
I imagine John Watson thinks love's a mystery to me, 

1116
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:02,920
but the chemistry is incredibly simple and very destructive. 

1117
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:07,560
When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait - how true of you. 

1118
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,000
the combination to your safe, your measurements - 

1119
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,960
but this, this is far more intimate, 

1120
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:15,880
this is your heart and you should never let it rule your head. 

1121
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:19,320
You could have chosen any number and walked out with everything. 

1122
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,080
But you just couldn't resist it, could you? 

1123
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:27,040
I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage. 

1124
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,000
Thank you for the final proof. 

1125
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,840
Everything I said, it's not real. 

1126
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,480
I was just playing the game. 

1127
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,080
I know. 

1128
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,040
And this is just losing. 

1129
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,040
There you are, Brother, 

1130
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,400
hope the contents make up for any inconvenience caused tonight. 

1131
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,520
- I'm certain they will. 
- If you're feeling kind, lock her up, 

1132
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,840
let her go and I doubt she'll survive long. 

1133
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,600
- Are you expecting me to beg? 
- Yes. 

1134
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,640
Please. 

1135
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,520
You're right. 

1136
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,760
I won't even last six months. 

1137
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,240
Sorry about dinner. 

1138
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,640
You don't smoke. 

1139
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,360
I also don't frequent cafes. 

1140
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,720
This the file on Irene Adler? 

1141
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,640
Closed forever. 

1142
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,240
I am about to go and inform my brother - 

1143
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,160
or, if you prefer, you are - 

1144
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:13,400
that she somehow got herself into a witness protection scheme in America. 

1145
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,240
New name, new identity. 

1146
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:20,120
She will survive and thrive... 

1147
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,040
..but he will never see her again. 

1148
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,400
Why would he care? 

1149
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,800
He despised her at the end. 

1150
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,840
Won't even mention her by name, just 'The Woman'. 

1151
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,400
Is that loathing or a salute? 

1152
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,040
One of a kind, the one woman who matters. 

1153
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,400
He's not like that. 

1154
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,160
He doesn't feel things that way, I don't think. 

1155
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,800
My brother has the brain of a scientist or a philosopher, 

1156
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,840
yet he elects to be a detective. 

1157
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,280
What might we deduce about his heart? 

1158
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,640
I don't know. 

1159
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,880
Neither do I. 

1160
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,920
But, initially, he wanted to be a pirate. 

1161
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,520
He'll be OK with this - 

1162
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,800
witness protection, never seeing her again - he'll be fine. 

1163
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,080
I agree. 

1164
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,440
That's why I decided to tell him that. 

1165
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,320
Instead of what? 

1166
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,960
She's dead. 

1167
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,560
She was captured by a terrorist cell in Karachi two months ago 

1168
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,040
and beheaded. 

1169
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,040
It was definitely her? 

1170
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,600
She's done this before. 

1171
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,680
I was thorough this time. 

1172
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,880
It would take Sherlock Holmes to fool me, 

1173
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,120
and I don't think he was on hand, do you? 

1174
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,000
So... 

1175
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,120
What shall we tell Sherlock? 

1176
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,040
Clearly you've got news. 

1177
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,520
If it's about the Leeds triple murder, it was the gardener. 

1178
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,040
- Did nobody notice the earring? 
- Hi. 

1179
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:11,960
Er no, it's, um...it's about Irene Adler. 

1180
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,480
Well? 

1181
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,800
Something happened? Has she come back? 

1182
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,320
No, she's...I bumped into Mycroft downstairs, he had to take a call. 

1183
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,080
Is she back in London? 

1184
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,320
No... 

1185
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,840
She's, er... 

1186
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,400
- She's in America. 
- America? 

1187
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,800
Got herself on a witness protection scheme, apparently. 

1188
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,680
Don't know how she swung it, but...well, you know. 

1189
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,040
- I know what? 
- You won't be able to see her again. 

1190
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,840
- Why would I want to see her again? 
- Didn't say you did. 

1191
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,000
- Is that her file? 
- Yes, I was going to take it back to Mycroft. 

1192
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,560
- Do you want to... 
- No. 

1193
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,920
Listen, actually... 

1194
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,080
But I will have the camera-phone though. 

1195
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,920
- There's nothing on it, it's been stripped... 
- I know, but I... 

1196
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,440
..I'll still have it. 

1197
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,600
I've got to give this back to Mycroft, you can't keep it. 

1198
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:20,080
Sherlock, I have to give this to Mycroft, it's the government's now... 

1199
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,000
Please. 

1200
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:36,400
Thank you. 

1201
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,560
- Well, I'd better take this back. 
- Yes. 

1202
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:53,640
Did she ever text you again, after all that? 

1203
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,160
Once, a few months ago. 

1204
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,440
What did she say? 

1205
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,200
"Goodbye, Mr Holmes." 

1206
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,240
EROTIC MOAN TEXT ALERT 

1207
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,160
When I say run... 

1208
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,680
..run! 

1209
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:33,040
HE LAUGHS 

1210
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,040
The Woman. 

1211
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,880
- THE 
- Woman.
