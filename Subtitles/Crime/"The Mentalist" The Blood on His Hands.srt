1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,297
(Indistinct conversations)

2
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:12,952
(Siren wails)

3
00:00:12,953 --> 00:00:15,888
(Train whistle blows)

4
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:19,759
(Woman speaking indistinctly
over radio)

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,863
4972 West 21st Street...
(Speaks indistinctly)

6
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:26,438
(Lisbon) Ah.

7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:27,773
(Groans)

8
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:30,242
Nice of you to show up,
Pokey.

9
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,611
Yeah, sorry I'm late.
Had traffic on the 50.

10
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:33,913
Looks like the coroner's
finishing up.

11
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:37,173
- Talk to him, see what he's got.
- The traffic got lipstick on you.

12
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:38,841
What? Where?

13
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:41,211
Hope she gave you breakfast.
Forensics ate all the bagels.

14
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,309
Late and later.
What's your excuse?

15
00:00:44,374 --> 00:00:46,376
It's all a journey, Lisbon.

16
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,395
She washed up here
sometime last night.

17
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:50,871
A jogger found her this morning,
called it in.

18
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:53,161
The only identifiable mark
is that tattoo.

19
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,435
Coroner says she was strangled
before she hit the water.

20
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:58,437
Some tissue
under her fingernails.

21
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,793
Might've scratched the killer.
No sign of sexual assault.

22
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:04,951
Lisbon.
Yeah?

23
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:07,487
Check between her toes.
Why?

24
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:11,024
Because
I don't really want to.

25
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:12,292
Needle marks.

26
00:01:12,293 --> 00:01:13,527
(Rigsby) She was an addict?

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,478
Manicure but no pedicure.

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,147
Didn't want people
to see her feet.

29
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:20,483
The track marks don't
seem fresh. Maybe she got clean.

30
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:23,342
As soon as the M.E.
identifies her,

31
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:25,530
I want you to go and see
if she has any drug arrests

32
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:27,598
and check out
the local rehab centers.

33
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,300
(Rigsby) Yeah, you got it.

34
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:31,369
(Cell phone rings)

35
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,870
(Ring)

36
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:34,139
Yeah?
(Man) Mr. Jane,

37
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:36,241
this is Agent Vint Molinari,
missing persons.

38
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:37,976
I'm on the Kristina Frye case.

39
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,191
An old client of Frye's
was listening to

40
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:44,260
some psychic call-in show
on the radio the other day,

41
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:47,197
heard somebody she swears
was Kristina.

42
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:49,666
We've got a recording
of the show.

43
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,068
Can you tell me (Click)
if this is her voice?

44
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:55,372
(Kristina) I spoke to the last
<i>caller's late mother Susan.</i>

45
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:57,540
<i>She told me she's happy</i>

46
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:01,044
and wants her daughter to know
<i>how proud of her she is.</i>

47
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:03,279
It's her.
Did you trace the call?

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,748
Comes from a landline,

49
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,284
house on Dellmore Road,
North of Femont Landing.

50
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:10,787
I'll let you know
if we find anything there.

51
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,326
(Woman) 4972 West 21st Street,
number 3.

52
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,963
(Woman) I need an escort
for 148 North St. Andrews.

53
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:21,664
(Speaks indistinctly)

54
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:29,239
(Woman) Unit 14, clear.

55
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:33,610
(Knocks on door)

56
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,944
Jane.

57
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:36,646
How you doing?

58
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:27,641

60
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:38,882
Blood on the wall--

61
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:41,685
D.N.A. analysis says
it's Frye's.

62
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:44,175
And the house was clean.

63
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:47,013
No prints or trace evidence
of any kind.

64
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:49,249
No sign of a body
or a grave.

65
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,150
She's alive.

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,662
If he killed her, he would've
left her body out on display.

67
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:54,764
Vint, it looks like this is

68
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,500
more than just
a missing persons case to me.

69
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,047
I'm gonna talk to
the head of the division

70
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:59,614
and ask him to
hand the case over to us.

71
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,425
Why? Because it's Red John,
you're the Red John guys?

72
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,445
I've read his file, too.

73
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,214
Frye's been missing
for four months.

74
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,549
Red John never kept a victim
alive for more than a few days.

75
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,219
He never left
a-a clue on the scene

76
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,221
except
for the--the painted face.

77
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,090
And that call Frye made--
that's hardly a cry for help.

78
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,881
What's your point?

79
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,884
Well, who knows if Red John
had anything to do with this?

80
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,029
As far as I know,
Frye painted the face herself.

81
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,433
Why would she do that?

82
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,602
(Scoffs) Well, the woman thinks
she talks to the dead.

83
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,004
She's half a nutcase
walking out the door.

84
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,240
Lisbon, I-I agree
with Agent Molinari.

85
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,642
Kristina's case should remain
in his capable hands.

86
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,345
Let's, uh, not get in the way.

87
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,082
(Sets down mug)

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,048
I don't understand.

89
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,247
You don't want the case?

90
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:51,283
So what are you doing?
(Elevator Bell dings, doors slide open)

91
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:52,369
Nothing.

92
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:54,794
Why don't we just skip the part
where you lie to me

93
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:56,822
and get right to the part

94
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:58,791
where you tell me
what you're gonna do?

95
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,343
Red John let Kristina make
a call that could be traced.

96
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:03,594
He's playing a game.
With who?

97
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:08,975
See you later.

98
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,381
Yeah, that sounds great.
I can make it there by 7:00.

99
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,617
Listen, I have to go. I'll speak
to you later, okay? Bye.

100
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,234
If you're seeing traffic
on the 50 tonight,

101
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,896
you think she could set
her alarm a little earlier?

102
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:23,638
(Sighs) Okay, look, I get it.
This is, uh,

103
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,374
it's the last time you have
to hear about my love life.

104
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,202
I don't care
about your love life.

105
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,405
Just don't let it
affect the job.

106
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,652
My love life is not gonna affect--
(Lisbon) Hey.

107
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:34,107
Hey, boss.
Anything on the girl in the River?

108
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,675
Name's Celia Jovanovich.

109
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:37,939
Some convictions for
narcotics possession. No family.

110
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,402
What about the rehab angle?

111
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:41,452
No mention of a program
in her record.

112
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:42,654
(Computer alert chimes)
Well, she must've cleaned up somehow.

113
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:45,363
No arrests in almost two years.
Hey, that tattoo on our vic?

114
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,332
It's worn by members
of Visualize.

115
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,096
Visualize? The cult?
They do work with addicts.

116
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:51,183
She could've cleaned up there.

117
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,253
See? The wings form a "v" for "Visualize."
Yeah.

118
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,522
What was the name
of the guy who runs it?

119
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,191
Stiles. Bret Stiles.

120
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,529
Agent Lisbon,

121
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,431
I'm brother Steven Wench.

122
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,899
Mr. Jane...
Mm?

123
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,869
This is Warner Vander Hoek,
our Chief of Security.

124
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,371
Julius Coles, our attorney.
How do you do, Agent?

125
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,940
Quite an impressive file
at CBI, Lisbon.

126
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,344
I know if anyone can find
Celia's killer, you can.

127
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,547
I appreciate your confidence,
Mr. Vander Hoek.

128
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,049
How did you read my file?

129
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,925
I spent 11 years
working Seattle Homicide,

130
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,294
seven years
in the Intelligence Division.

131
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:30,330
Ooh. That's a whole lot of cop
for a self-help group.

132
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:33,484
We have enemies.

133
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:36,053
As Mr. Stiles says,

134
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:39,123
the truth always does.

135
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:41,292
Where is, uh, Bret?

136
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:43,194
I'm afraid brother Stiles

137
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,196
is busy with church business
at the moment.

138
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:48,299
And why are you so afraid?
It's a figure of speech?

139
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,203
Yes, it is. Shall we?
Yes, we should.

140
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,305
(Patrick) Lead the way.

141
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,272
<i>My name is Celia Jovanovich.</i>

142
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:58,598
<i>This picture was taken when</i>
<i>I had been a heroin addict</i>

143
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,066
<i>for nine years.</i>

144
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,468
<i>I had no job or home,</i>

145
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,305
<i>no future, no hope.</i>

146
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:09,675
<i>But I beat addiction</i>
<i>and changed my life</i>

147
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,879
<i>when I began to Visualize.</i>
(Click)

148
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,814
Our addiction counselors

149
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,949
found her literally
living in the streets.

150
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,985
She attempted suicide
three times.

151
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:22,588
They...
They brought her here, and...

152
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,601
This is what she became.

153
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,892
Well, she certainly became
better at doing her makeup.

154
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:29,553
Your low personal opinion
of Visualize

155
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:31,089
is duly noted...
But irrelevant.

156
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,905
Let's try and confine
our discussion to the facts.

157
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:36,839
Of course. Uh, Mr. Coles, you're
not a member here, are you?

158
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:37,998
I am not.

159
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:40,389
Mm. That's interesting
that Mr. Stiles would hire

160
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,824
a lawyer outside
of the sacred fold. Hmm?

161
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,860
Oh,
what did Celia do here?

162
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:46,662
She worked
in our security section.

163
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,133
It's called vigilance.

164
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,669
We provide personal security
for the church's senior leaders.

165
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,672
I was her, uh, supervisor.
What's her home address?

166
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:57,508
She lived here. We provide homes
for members who want them.

167
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,559
Celia had had it tough.
The--the church was her haven.

168
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,829
And we're gonna need to speak
to all of her friends,

169
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:06,776
acquaintances, coworkers.
That'll be fine, with the proviso

170
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,069
that I or one of my associates
be present at all times.

171
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,238
Was there anybody in particular
that she was close to?

172
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,792
There was a fiancé,
David Herren.

173
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,261
He's a member of the church,

174
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:17,574
but I don't know
where he is right now.

175
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,704
Huh.

176
00:08:20,984 --> 00:08:24,154
I'm sure you'll be able
to locate him for us.

177
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,701
Agent, I assume you will be looking
at suspects <i>outside</i> the church.

178
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:29,504
I'd hate to think that this was
some sort of witch hunt.

179
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:31,687
Oh, we'll go wherever
the investigation leads us.

180
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:36,567
(Man) So, um, thank you very much.
Okay.

181
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:37,968
Uh, excuse me.

182
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,314
Hmm?
Uh, Tec-- interesting name.

183
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:43,053
Yeah. Yeah. (Chuckles)
You look like an honest young man.

184
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:44,977
Do you know where brother Stiles
is right now?

185
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:46,575
No, sir, I don't.

186
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:48,161
Very honest. Terrible liar.

187
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,671
Is--is he this way?
Oh. Uh...

188
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,205
Or is he this way? Okay.

189
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:54,307
Sir, I-I don't think that--
uh, sir?

190
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:57,710
Yeah, spit it out.
I-I don't understand what you're doing.

191
00:08:57,758 --> 00:08:59,159
You don't want to tell me
where Stiles is,

192
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:01,369
so when I move you in his
location, you react negatively.

193
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:02,772
I'm just reading
your negative reaction.

194
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,686
Well, please stop.
You're gonna get me in trouble.

195
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,382
This way?

196
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,758
Please don't go in there,
sir.

197
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,645
Thank you.

198
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:16,828
(Door beeps and closes)

199
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,284
Oh.

200
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:20,120
(Man) You see,

201
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,217
if the mind is free,

202
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:25,287
there's nothing
that you can't achieve.

203
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:29,784
Because then the mind
has no limits.

204
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:33,522
I-it's a spaceship
with the power to travel across

205
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,072
all six dimensions,

206
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:37,736
journeying off to--

207
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,462
excuse me, uh, Bret?
I have a question.

208
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,627
What?

209
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:44,428
Sorry. Did somebody speak?

210
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:46,731
Uh, it--it was me.

211
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,466
Oh. (Chuckles)

212
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,167
Patrick?
Yeah.

213
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:52,236
How nice to see you.

214
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:54,372
Why offer
only six dimensions?

215
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:58,476
Is--is it to hold off a couple
of dimensions to sell later?

216
00:09:58,477 --> 00:09:59,877
(Laughs)

217
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:02,280
I think six is quite enough.

218
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:05,783
When did you last see
Celia Jovanovich?

219
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,018
Oh, uh, Celia.

220
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,354
Yes, um, let me think. Um...

221
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:13,124
I believe she worked
a security detail for me

222
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,660
earlier in the week--

223
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:18,829
a seminar for premembers
at the Hyatt.

224
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,031
Premembers?

225
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:23,596
Those that have not yet seen
the truth.

226
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:26,333
You would be a premember.

227
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,901
Poor Celia.

228
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:29,235
It's tragic.

229
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:32,038
Uh, she fought so hard
for her sobriety.

230
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,641
When did you learn
of her death?

231
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:36,076
Well, I don't know.

232
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:38,111
I suppose
when they identified the body.

233
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:40,914
You know, many policemen
are Visualize members.

234
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:44,160
What do you think
happened to her?

235
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,462
No idea.
You have a theory?

236
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:48,464
Oh, no.

237
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,533
I never theorize.

238
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:54,904
We gurus must <i>always</i>
speak the truth

239
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,307
or... nothing.

240
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,809
You were surprised
I was here about Celia.

241
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:01,197
Why did you think
I was here?

242
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:02,987
Kristina Frye, of course.

243
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:12,616
Kristina Frye?

244
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:16,626
Red John has her, right?

245
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,179
It's a terrible thing.

246
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:23,611
First your wife and child,

247
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,874
now miss Frye.

248
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,395
Sounds like he's jealous,
Patrick.

249
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,963
It sounds like

250
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:33,099
he wants to take away
everything

251
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,068
and everyone
that you care about.

252
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,305
It's a form of love,
you know.

253
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:47,274
What do you know about
Kristina Frye and Red John?

254
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,675
Patrick, I like you.

255
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:54,111
I like your vim.

256
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:55,879
And Red John--

257
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,984
he seems to be a perfectly
unpleasant sort of fellow.

258
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:06,631
If I knew how to get you even
<i>half</i> a step closer to him,

259
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:10,369
I would cross desert wastes
to tell you.

260
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,038
But I don't know.

261
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,707
(Knock on door)
<i>Avanti.</i>

262
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,676
Ah,Starsky and Hutch.

263
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,368
Thank goodness.

264
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:23,438
Mr. Jane might have cut me
into small cubes by now.

265
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:31,747
God is in your mind,
right here.

266
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:35,350
All you have to do to see him
is clear out the bad energy.

267
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:36,819
I'll repeat the question.

268
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,888
Have you seen Celia Jovanovich
in the past 48 hours?

269
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:42,191
I've been visiting my mother
in Chino.

270
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:44,126
I got back this morning.

271
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:46,495
That's all I need. Thanks.
Aren't you interested

272
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:48,279
in the path to spiritual clarity
and personal freedom?

273
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:49,594
No.

274
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:53,969
How's it goin'?

275
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,939
(Sighs) Well, Celia was nice,
and a good team member,

276
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,821
and joining Visualize is a good
idea. That's it, pretty much.

277
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,008
Keep trying. You seen Jane?

278
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:01,978
Yeah, he's upstairs.

279
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,031
Vander Hoek took him upstairs
to see Celia's room.

280
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:06,967
Is he okay?
I guess. Why?

281
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:09,076
Nothing. Stiles just seems
to get to him a little bit.

282
00:13:09,086 --> 00:13:10,016
That's a neat trick.

283
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:12,940
Yeah, I wish he'd teach it to me.
I got the fiancé's details.

284
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:15,142
David Herren works
at a restaurant downtown.

285
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:17,244
Go talk to him.
Okay.

286
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:19,313
You--come on. Let's talk.

287
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:21,882
Before we do,
can I just ask,

288
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:23,717
are you happy in your lives?

289
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:29,056
Sit down.

290
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:33,827
This was Celia's room.

291
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,097
Thank you.

292
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,866
David Herren?

293
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:14,901
Yeah.
Wayne Rigsby, CBI.

294
00:14:14,902 --> 00:14:16,680
I need to, uh, talk to you
about Celia Jovanovich.

295
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,890
Yeah, yeah.
Listen, the thing is I--

296
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,085
one moment, David.

297
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:22,222
Hi. I'm Julius Coles,
David's attorney.

298
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:26,107
Wow. You guys are organized.
"Us guys"? Feels prejudicial.

299
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,730
You have a problem with
constitutional rights?

300
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,703
No, sir.

301
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:31,397
I was a mess
when I heard the news.

302
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:33,400
But I remember
what Mr. Stiles says--

303
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,933
clarify the mind with
discipline, order, work.

304
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:36,910
Are you the Head Chef?

305
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:40,228
Prep chef now.
Maybe more than that someday.

306
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:42,797
How long had you been
engaged to Celia?

307
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,967
A couple of weeks.
And how long had you known her before?

308
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,036
I didn't... know her.

309
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:50,171
I mean--
I don't understand.

310
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:52,740
I had
never seen her before.

311
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:54,142
High level Visualize members

312
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,811
often opt for what are called
designed marriages.

313
00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:58,937
The partners are matched for, uh...
Energy consilience.

314
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:00,486
So it was an arranged marriage?

315
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:01,701
A rational marriage.

316
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:04,910
I knew the minute I saw Celia
we belonged together.

317
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:08,013
Was there someone else? Someone
angry about being replaced?

318
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:10,816
An ex-boyfriend perhaps?
Absolutely not.

319
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:13,385
How can you be so certain?
You only just met her.

320
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:16,908
Knowledge comes to those
who are open to it, Agent.

321
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:19,577
I knew Celia.
There was no one else.

322
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:22,313
Are you sure?
Because Celia was strangled.

323
00:15:22,314 --> 00:15:26,697
That's a killer who's upset,
really wants to hurt the victim.

324
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:29,591
There wasn't anybody who might
have been mad at you and Celia,

325
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:30,717
might have made <i>you</i> mad?

326
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:32,013
There's no need to answer that.

327
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:33,438
I'm just trying to get
the picture here.

328
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:35,229
No, you're poking at him
with wild conjecture

329
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:37,112
to see how he reacts,
and I won't have it.

330
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,546
This is over.

331
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:44,318
(Exhales deeply)

332
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:55,295
(Closes book)

333
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:07,074
(Rips plastic)

334
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,633
So I checked into Herren.
Cooking's just a hobby.

335
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:31,202
His family's loaded--
old lumber money.

336
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:34,038
When he turns 27,
he inherits $10 million.

337
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,174
That's probably why
Stiles arranged the marriage.

338
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,110
With Celia married to Herren, the church
is more likely to tap into the money.

339
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,818
Yeah, but it's not motive
for Herren to kill Celia.

340
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:44,118
Oh, was there anything else from
the interviews at Visualize?

341
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,886
Nothing useful.

342
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,329
They all seem so happy.
I mean, truly happy.

343
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,364
Yeah. It's creepy.

344
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:54,468
Jane. Kinda lost track of you
at Visualize.

345
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:57,137
Took a nap.

346
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,342
Is something on your mind?

347
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:04,044
No, no.
Um, I'm gonna be upstairs.

348
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:06,714
Uh...

349
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:09,216
Celia had some problems
with Visualize philosophy--

350
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:11,719
questions,
issues with the dogma.

351
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,855
She, uh, might have wanted
to talk to someone about it.

352
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:18,025
Someone outside of the church.

353
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:24,264
Someone mentioned a friend of
hers who was a member but left.

354
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:27,434
Um... Lucy Joel.

355
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:33,970
Are you <i>sure</i> nobody was
following you, saw you come in?

356
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,405
Lucy, nobody followed us.

357
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:38,075
(Lucy sighs)
I'm not crazy, okay?

358
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:40,777
I have been followed
and threatened.

359
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:43,980
Visualize doesn't like
when people leave the hive.

360
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:47,451
When you're a member,
every week you sit down

361
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:51,888
in front of a camera and lay out
every bad thing you've done.

362
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:54,424
I mean, <i>everything.</i>

363
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,892
It's called ventilation.

364
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:59,329
Your vent vids.
It's supposed to air you out.

365
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,499
It makes you feel great,
clean.

366
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,468
(Scoffs)
Then when you're leaving,

367
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:07,938
they say, "whoa. We know
all this nasty stuff.

368
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:10,171
You're not gonna say anything
bad about Visualize, are you""

369
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,354
We're not here to get dirt
on Visualize.

370
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:14,590
We wanna talk about Celia.

371
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:16,325
Yeah.

372
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,760
She was sweet,

373
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:20,162
almost too nice, you know?

374
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:22,965
She needed people
a little too much.

375
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,402
She knew Visualize was crazy,

376
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:29,605
but they'd gotten her clean.

377
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:33,108
Ugh. And she was scared
to leave, you know?

378
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:35,811
Thought she'd start using
again.

379
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,847
Was she in touch with you?

380
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:40,616
She'd call, just to talk,

381
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:43,752
bitch about the church,
you know, stuff.

382
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:45,988
Was there anything specific
on her mind?

383
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:49,173
I-I can't. I'm sorry.
I don't want any trouble.

384
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:49,583
Lucy, listen.
We can offer you--

385
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:52,261
no. L--it was really hard
to leave that place.

386
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:56,365
Now I'm good with the church,
and the church is good with me.

387
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:58,801
Everything's good.

388
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:00,836
Listen,
I know you're scared,

389
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:03,706
but right now
you're Celia's guardian,

390
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:06,342
the only one
that can help her.

391
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:08,511
It's up to you.

392
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:10,613
(Sighs)

393
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:15,384
She was having an affair with
somebody very big in the church.

394
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:17,486
She wouldn't tell me his name.

395
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:20,155
Then she was
supposed to marry Herren.

396
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:22,224
And he was sweet,

397
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:24,627
kept saying he loved her.

398
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:28,097
She felt bad lying to him.

399
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,099
Last time I talked to her,

400
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,134
she said
she had to do something,

401
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,303
but she didn't say what.

402
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:39,241
And if anybody finds out
I told you that,

403
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,710
I am <i>so</i> dead.

404
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:48,777
You were great in there.

405
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,480
"You're Celia's guardian."

406
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,483
It was nice.

407
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,520
I lied this morning.

408
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:59,623
I do care that
you're seeing someone else.

409
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:01,958
It hurts a little.

410
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,995
I mean, it's no biggie.
I'll get over it.

411
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:08,031
I want us to be friends.

412
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,399
(Sighs)

413
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,469
We can get to that point,
right?

414
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,338
Can we be just friends?

415
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,440
Yeah. Sure, we can.

416
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:19,843
Good. I'd like that.

417
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,348
Behind us.

418
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,549
Huh?

419
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,084
Someone's tailing us.

420
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:30,654
Visualize?

421
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:34,357
Oh, yeah.
I guess Lucy isn't crazy.

422
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,192
Getting the plates.

423
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,295
Should I pull 'em over?

424
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:39,731
Can you get behind 'em?

425
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:42,684
Throw a loop? Easy. Watch.

426
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:46,187
(Engine revs)
Grace!

427
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:49,023
(Tires screech)

428
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:56,385
Grace!
(Tires screech)

429
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:58,187
Ohh.Hh.

430
00:20:58,188 --> 00:21:00,890
You okay? You okay?
Yeah, yeah. You?

431
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:03,392
Yeah.
I just-- I just need a minute.

432
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:06,195
Can you go check on the other guys?
Mm.

433
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:11,100
(Groaning and panting)

434
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:14,970
Hey. CBI. You wanna tell me
what the hell you're doing?

435
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:17,922
FBI. I could ask you
the same thing.

436
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:24,346
Agent O'laughlin, is it?

437
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:26,982
Craig O'laughlin.
That's right, ma'am.

438
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:30,752
You wanna tell me why the FBI
was tailing two of my agents?

439
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:33,755
Sure. We've been looking
at Bret Stiles and Visualize

440
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:36,091
for a couple years now.
And we've had allegations

441
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:38,594
of tax fraud, racketeering,
and a lot worse,

442
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:40,396
but we haven't gotten our hands
on anybody that could tell us

443
00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:42,716
about the organization.
Tight as a drum.

444
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:43,921
Yeah, but why follow us?

445
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,469
My boss thinks Stiles may have
people inside law enforcement,

446
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,212
which would explain why we're not
getting anywhere with the investigation.

447
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,336
Y-you think that we're working
with Visualize?

448
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:55,658
She wanted us to look into
the possibility. That's all.

449
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:57,904
And I've seen
no evidence of it.

450
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:01,916
What you did was reckless.

451
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,252
I should bring you up
for departmental discipline.

452
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,909
But <i>he</i> shouldn't have been
following you,

453
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,427
so I'm gonna let it pass.

454
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:12,761
And you tell your boss
if she wants to catch bad guys,

455
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:15,063
she should follow bad guys.

456
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:19,267
It was a pleasure
working with the FBI.

457
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:21,036
(Scoffs)

458
00:22:21,037 --> 00:22:24,706
Hey, listen. I'm sorry
about that. Does it hurt?

459
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:27,275
No. No, it's not that bad.

460
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:29,344
Thanks.

461
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:31,379
You know,

462
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,114
Van Pelt...
Mm-hmm.

463
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:36,023
You--you related
to Amos Van Pelt, by any chance,

464
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:37,713
the foot-football coach
at Burton?

465
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:40,378
He's my father.

466
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:42,847
Whoa. Uh, he was
one hell of a coach.

467
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:44,849
I was a wide receiver
at U. of M.

468
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,286
Your, uh, your dad gave us
one tough game.

469
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:49,821
O'laughlin...

470
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:52,590
Didn't you go NFL? Tennessee.

471
00:22:52,591 --> 00:22:54,959
I did, yeah.
Yeah, just a couple of years.

472
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,394
Thanks for remembering.

473
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:59,597
Anyway, I should get back
to the office,

474
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:02,366
get beat up by my own boss.

475
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:05,036
You see your dad,
tell him he's remembered.

476
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:07,405
I will. Thanks.

477
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:09,006
Yeah.

478
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,193
Hey. Excuse me.

479
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:18,908
You're the FBI guy, right?

480
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,587
I'm a special Agent in charge,
if that's what you mean.

481
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:21,834
Now, that's exactly
what I mean.

482
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,711
So you guys are
investigating Visualize

483
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,382
and this character
Bret Stiles, right?

484
00:23:26,392 --> 00:23:28,176
I guess that's
common knowledge by now.

485
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,307
Yeah.

486
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:33,256
Do you have a guy deep inside
the church, you know, un-undercover Agent?

487
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:36,031
You can't seriously
be asking me that.

488
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:38,548
So that's a "yes."
Any chance of a name?

489
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,025
No. No chance.

490
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:44,894
We have to get back
to Visualize.

491
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:46,329
Why is that?

492
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,099
Celia Jovanovich was almost
certainly killed by her lover,

493
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,534
so she almost certainly
mentioned his name

494
00:23:51,535 --> 00:23:52,969
in her vent video.

495
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,205
Ergo, we need
to see her videos.

496
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:57,607
I'll get my coat.

497
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:02,746
What do you have in there?

498
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:05,348
Oh, look at that.
Thank you.

499
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:09,853
"To make ourselves
fully conscious,

500
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:13,556
"the challenge is
to expand the power of mind

501
00:24:13,557 --> 00:24:16,493
"by dispelling doubt and guilt

502
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:19,929
so that we may find in our--"
(Loud pop)

503
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,766
Sorry. Didn't mean
to startle anyone.

504
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:26,670
Well, actually, I did.
You got a minute?

505
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:29,039
What is it, Mr. Jane?

506
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:34,077
(Lowered voice) You're the FBI's
undercover Agent, right?

507
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:35,512
What?

508
00:24:35,513 --> 00:24:37,881
I need a favor.
Just a small one.

509
00:24:37,882 --> 00:24:39,849
Get rid of 'em.

510
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,054
Guys, take a break.

511
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:52,028
(Lowered voice) I have no idea
what you're talking about.

512
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:54,464
Well, when I just
popped the bag right now,

513
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:56,399
your hand went for your hip.

514
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,401
You were reaching
for your gun.

515
00:24:58,402 --> 00:25:01,538
It's a cop instinct.
Never goes away.

516
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:04,240
(Indistinct conversations)

517
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,643
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

518
00:25:06,644 --> 00:25:08,611
This is
an ongoing investigation,

519
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:11,581
and I spent three years working
my way into this organization.

520
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:14,384
Hey, don't freak out, Serpico.
I need one little thing.

521
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:16,186
Forget it.

522
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:18,288
Your investigation is dead.

523
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,291
If I picked you out, then Stiles
has definitely picked you out.

524
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:24,294
The only reason he hasn't
gotten rid of you is because

525
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:26,830
he's using you. He's feeding you
false information.

526
00:25:26,831 --> 00:25:29,165
Do you have
any usable evidence?

527
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,601
No. Didn't think so.

528
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:35,137
And you never will.
You can help me, though.

529
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:38,007
Together, we can catch
Celia Jovanovich's killer.

530
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,293
What's this about?

531
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,843
I need to see
one of her vent videos,

532
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:45,234
and I need you to take me
to where they're kept.

533
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,644
Get a warrant.

534
00:25:46,757 --> 00:25:48,158
Warrants take time.
And meanwhile,

535
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:51,011
back at the ranch,
they're wiping the tapes.

536
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:56,683
The room
where they're stored

537
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:59,419
is full
of security cameras.

538
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,688
They'll be on to you
in minutes.

539
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:03,657
Yes, they will.

540
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:07,995
That's what
I'm talking about. Let's go.

541
00:26:09,998 --> 00:26:11,732
(Door closes)

542
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:16,970
Ah, Agent Lisbon.

543
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:19,473
What's all this about
you wanting Celia's vent videos?

544
00:26:19,474 --> 00:26:22,009
We believe Celia Jovanovich
may have identified her killer

545
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,910
in one of the videos.

546
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:24,804
We'd like to take a look
at 'em.

547
00:26:24,814 --> 00:26:28,188
No, no, no. That's impossible.
The ventilations show

548
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:30,457
our members
at their most vulnerable.

549
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,525
Only senior members
of the church

550
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:33,161
are allowed to see them.

551
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,534
I mean,
I could no more show you them

552
00:26:35,535 --> 00:26:37,936
than a priest could discuss
a confession. Hmm?

553
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,212
Now if you'll please
excuse me...

554
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:43,914
Sir?
Yeah.

555
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:46,249
Security feed
of Patrick Jane.

556
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,684
What?

557
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:53,924
Agent, this is
a security camera feed

558
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,626
from our video room.

559
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:57,728
What's going on?

560
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,066
It's been about half an hour.

561
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:13,605
This is outrageous.

562
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:15,441
I'm getting bored.

563
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:19,144
Mr. Stiles is calling in
every important person he knows

564
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:21,213
to try and get us fired.

565
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:22,715
It takes time.

566
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:24,416
(Door opens)

567
00:27:26,252 --> 00:27:28,120
Ah.

568
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:30,038
You're done.
You are done.

569
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,048
We've spoken
to your superiors,

570
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:32,978
explained to them that
we view Mr. Jane's actions

571
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,653
as a grievous breach
of civil liberties.

572
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:36,719
We'll be pursuing civil
and criminal remedies.

573
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,122
Meh.

574
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,786
I'm curious.

575
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:43,790
You couldn't hope to watch these
videos for any length of time.

576
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:47,127
What did you think
you'd accomplish by coming here?

577
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:49,496
Oh, we'll see the videos.

578
00:27:49,497 --> 00:27:51,805
Oh, you <i>will</i> see them, will you?
And--and how is that? (Chuckles)

579
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:53,097
You'll give them to us.

580
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:55,963
Oh, really? And why? Why?

581
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:05,940
(Lowered voice) Celia Jovanovich
was killed by her lover--

582
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:09,009
someone very high up
in your church,

583
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:11,808
someone that is very probably
in this room right now.

584
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:15,014
(Lowered voice) Well, that's very interesting,
if it were true.

585
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:18,850
And I daresay, is mentioned
in her videos.

586
00:28:19,103 --> 00:28:22,339
So if you say
you'll give us the videos,

587
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,132
the killer
will identify himself.

588
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:26,701
He will be the man
that insists most forcefully

589
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:29,304
that you shouldn't give 'em
to us.

590
00:28:30,215 --> 00:28:32,082
What if I killed her?

591
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,385
You?

592
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:36,387
You wouldn't hurt a fly.

593
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:39,557
(Chuckles)

594
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:41,525
(Clears throat)

595
00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:43,527
(Normal voice)
Patrick has offered

596
00:28:43,528 --> 00:28:46,163
a very, um,
persuasive argument.

597
00:28:46,164 --> 00:28:48,597
I'm going to be handing over
the videos to him.

598
00:28:48,598 --> 00:28:50,198
No.

599
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:53,592
No. Absolutely n--
I-I can't allow that.

600
00:28:53,594 --> 00:28:54,619
Why not?

601
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:56,788
The precedent
would be unacceptable.

602
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:58,732
It would--
it would open up all manner

603
00:28:58,733 --> 00:28:59,846
of intrusive police action.

604
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:01,441
(Lowered voice)
That sounds like lawyer speak

605
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:03,533
for "I did it. I did it.
I'm guilty."

606
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:08,210
Mr. Coles,in a week or so, forensics
is gonna have processed

607
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:10,613
the D.N.A. that was under
the victim's fingernails.

608
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:12,295
We're gonna need a sample
from you.

609
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:15,181
That's ridiculous. That--
that is completely unnecessary.

610
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:17,135
(Normal voice) No, it's just
a pinprick. Doesn't hurt a bit.

611
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,821
Julius, please.

612
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:20,923
Tell me...

613
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:23,159
You did not kill...

614
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,095
That young woman.

615
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:29,365
No, I didn't.

616
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:35,137
That one--that--that
looked like it did hurt. Huh?

617
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:39,275
She was a sweet girl.

618
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:41,477
I'd see her
when I came to meet Bret.

619
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:44,680
She liked to talk about
the book she was reading.

620
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:46,782
Things just went from there.

621
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:49,118
I-I was...

622
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,887
I was very fond of her.

623
00:29:51,888 --> 00:29:54,624
And then Herren came
into the picture.

624
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,159
Celia said she had
to tell Herren the truth...

625
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,462
About us.

626
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:02,431
I told her, Visualize was
my only client.

627
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:03,866
Bret would banish me

628
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:07,370
if he knew I-I was involved
with a member.

629
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:11,674
She just kept saying
she couldn't lie.

630
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:14,710
She couldn't lie
to save my career.

631
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,579
(Sighs)

632
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,814
I got angry.

633
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:20,683
And we fought.

634
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,854
It happened.

635
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:28,891
(Gulps)

636
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:33,663
So we have a deal?
D.A. agreed--

637
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:37,299
involuntary manslaughter.
Three years with time served.

638
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,335
In exchange
for your cooperation

639
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:43,372
with the FBI's investigation
into Visualize and Bret Stiles.

640
00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:46,976
Okay, you got it.

641
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:50,079
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Coles.

642
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,614
Mm.

643
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:54,817
(Police radio chatter)

644
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:02,291
Ah.
Three years is nothing.

645
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:04,093
It's the way of the world.

646
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:06,729
He's selling Stiles. He's a big
fish. The FBI has to pay.

647
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,532
If you think about
this stuff too much,

648
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:10,933
you'll drive yourself crazy.

649
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:14,203
Hey, that's the boyfriend--
David Herren.
Oh!

650
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:16,539
Gun!
(Engine revs)

651
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:23,212
(O'laughlin) Drop your gun!
Drop it!

652
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,347
Drop it now!
Get your hands above your head!

653
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:27,950
Don't move!

654
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:32,154
Get your head down!

655
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:34,515
Head down!

656
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:43,319
I had to do something.
He killed my soul mate.

657
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,722
Inactivity is the sign
of the clouded mind.

658
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:49,392
Discipline, order, work.
Where'd you get the gun?

659
00:31:49,393 --> 00:31:51,928
I stole it from the desk
of the manager.

660
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:54,497
He keeps it
for making night deposits.

661
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:57,500
Did anyone else know
what you were gonna do?

662
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:59,902
Put me in prison.
I don't care.

663
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:01,738
My heart is free.

664
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:05,808
The minute I saw him, I knew.
I did the right thing.

665
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:08,811
Did anyone else know?

666
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:10,046
No.

667
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:12,515
It was my idea.

668
00:32:32,236 --> 00:32:34,504
(Cell phone alert chimes)

669
00:32:46,784 --> 00:32:49,686
(Horn honks)

670
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:03,633
Thanks for your time.

671
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:06,569
I understand
Herren confessed.

672
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:10,773
He didn't mention your name.

673
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:13,576
The poor soul.

674
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:17,847
But...
Why would he mention me?

675
00:33:17,848 --> 00:33:21,084
Well... you didn't go
and tell him to kill the man,

676
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:23,052
but you clarified his options,

677
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:27,557
which is as good as killing him,
as far as I'm concerned.

678
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:29,759
Is that the official view?

679
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,728
Is this why
you wanted to see me?

680
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:33,996
'Cause a phone call
would have been fine.

681
00:33:33,997 --> 00:33:35,465
The FBI's given up.

682
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,400
Oh, that's a shame.

683
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:40,670
I rather enjoyed Brother Wench
and his clumsy machinations.

684
00:33:40,671 --> 00:33:42,939
Oh, well, there it is.

685
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,274
You're safe.

686
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,809
Bravo.

687
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,047
Well, always nice to know,
but that's not why I'm here.

688
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:53,516
It seems
that your friend John

689
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:57,120
is planning
a surprise party for you.

690
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:01,612
How do you know
what Red John is planning?

691
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,542
It doesn't matter.

692
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,763
It certainly matters to me.

693
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,796
How do you know
what Red John is planning?

694
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:09,832
My dear chap,
I know so much more

695
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:13,369
than you or Red John
could ever imagine.

696
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,906
Accept this
as a gift from a friend.

697
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:18,841
Or not.

698
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:47,069
(Police radio chatter)

699
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:00,149
(Door creaks)

700
00:35:04,555 --> 00:35:07,123
(Rigsby) Clear!

701
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:08,825
All clear.

702
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:10,393
(Cho) Clear.

703
00:35:10,394 --> 00:35:12,528
Boss.

704
00:35:33,116 --> 00:35:36,285
(Whispers) Boss.

705
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:49,098
Kristina?

706
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:57,773
Kristina.

707
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:08,784
E.M.T. Said

708
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:11,487
she had a puncture wound
in one arm, like from an I.V.

709
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:13,345
Must be how Red John
got the blood out of her.

710
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:15,642
He also said there was
no other sign of assault--

711
00:36:15,893 --> 00:36:18,060
physical, sexual, anything.

712
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:22,198
Why won't she speak?
What did he do to her?

713
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,909
Still nothing.
Not a sound.

714
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,379
Okay. (Clears throat)

715
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:42,852
(Bag rustles)

716
00:36:44,514 --> 00:36:46,015
Remember this?

717
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,823
(Bag thuds)

718
00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:56,127
Come on, Kristina.
Listen, it's Jane.

719
00:36:56,293 --> 00:36:59,329
You remember me.

720
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,365
I know you do.

721
00:37:02,366 --> 00:37:04,367
Hmm?

722
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:08,638
What's the worst date
you ever had?

723
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,907
Huh?

724
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:13,042
(Chuckles)

725
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:22,519
Kristina, please.

726
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,189
Please stop this.
Just speak to me.

727
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,231
(Sighs)

728
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,109
(Telephone rings)

729
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,512
Psych personnel are
on their way.

730
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:52,415
Could be worse, you know.

731
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:54,450
She could be dead.

732
00:37:57,188 --> 00:38:01,925
I guess tea is
always worth a try.

733
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:03,459
(Snaps fingers)

734
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,068
(Plastic rustles)

735
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:30,853
(Sighs)

736
00:38:30,854 --> 00:38:33,890
(Blinds rattle)

737
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:35,558
What is he doing?

738
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,193
I have no idea.

739
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:40,830
(Clears throat)

740
00:38:50,272 --> 00:38:53,342
I call on the spirits.

741
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:56,679
(Clicks tongue)

742
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,648
I ask for the presence

743
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:01,217
of the departed soul
of Kristina Frye.

744
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:06,889
Reveal yourself,
Kristina Frye.

745
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:11,928
Can you hear me, Kristina?

746
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:18,635
I can hear you, Patrick.

747
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,071
Well, thank you.

748
00:39:22,072 --> 00:39:24,507
Thank you
for speaking with me.

749
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:27,543
I'm so glad you called on me.

750
00:39:27,544 --> 00:39:30,380
I knew in the end,
you'd become a believer.

751
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:31,634
I am not a believer.

752
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:33,682
I hear sadness in your voice.
Don't be sad, Patrick.

753
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:37,920
Death is not the end.

754
00:39:37,921 --> 00:39:40,757
The afterlife's
a beautiful place.

755
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,826
It's peaceful here.

756
00:39:43,827 --> 00:39:47,430
Happy.

757
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:49,232
You're not dead.

758
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:54,070
You're talking to a ghost
and still you're a skeptic.

759
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:55,805
You are impossible.

760
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:58,641
You're not dead, Kristina.

761
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:00,310
You're alive.

762
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:03,313
You're in denial.

763
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:06,182
Eventually,
you'll accept the truth.

764
00:40:06,183 --> 00:40:08,184
I know it's hard.

765
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:12,622
God knows I struggled
against it myself.

766
00:40:15,926 --> 00:40:20,063
But you can't... fight...
Death.

767
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:23,633
How did you die?

768
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:26,402
I don't remember.

769
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:29,672
It's funny how things
become unimportant.

770
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:34,243
It's as if my life was
a dream.

771
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:36,245
I woke up.

772
00:40:36,246 --> 00:40:40,116
I can't recall what happened.

773
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:45,121
Did you see Red John?

774
00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:47,857
Who?

775
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:50,093
Red John.

776
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:54,197
Red John--
the man that abducted you.

777
00:40:57,368 --> 00:41:00,436
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

778
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:17,687
(Typing on keyboard)

779
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:26,562
(Telephone ringing in distance)

780
00:41:26,563 --> 00:41:29,365
Oh. Sure.

781
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,240
Apparently, Bret Stiles
is out of the country.

782
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:40,109
He's opening a center
in Jakarta.

783
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,779
Visualize people say they don't
know when he'll be back.

784
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,281
Hmm. Figures.
Hmm.

785
00:41:46,682 --> 00:41:48,384
Boss. We caught one.

786
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:51,053
Downtown.

787
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:55,992
Are you okay?

788
00:41:58,629 --> 00:42:01,264
We're up. Let's go.

789
