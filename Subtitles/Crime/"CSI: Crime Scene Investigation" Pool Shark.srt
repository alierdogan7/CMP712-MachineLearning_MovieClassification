00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,040
Hey, Catherine, hello.

177
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,769
Hey, yeah...

178
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,980
I thought I heard you coming.

179
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,112
Back on the rails.

180
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,247
Steady, thanks to you.

181
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,054
Permission to come aboard.

182
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,526
Permission granted, Captain.

183
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,653
This our girl?

184
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,232
Desiree McQuire, 28.

185
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,698
Arm's missing.

186
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,598
Got a hunch where it went,

187
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,104
but that is the aquatic vet's
purview, not mine.

188
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,072
C.O.D. exsanguination?

189
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,676
Seems obvious.

190
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,746
Well, a shark tooth.

191
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,974
Not a drop of blood on it.

192
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,012
Clean as a whistle.

193
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,714
No blood on the puncture.

194
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,016
Tells me the tissue

195
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,183
lacks vital response,
which means

196
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,454
there was no blood flowing
through the tissue

197
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,585
when she was bitten.

198
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,755
According to David's report,
she bled out in the pool.

199
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,493
Well, then,
blood had to be flowing.

200
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,967
How can both things be true?

201
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,935
Been a while, Drops.

202
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,009
That's your ganja, man.
And that's enough

203
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,168
to put you right back
in a ten-by-eight cell.

204
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,745
Let me guess.

205
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,348
One of your fancy
machines fingered me?

206
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,451
Yeah, so, uh, what now?

207
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,644
You guys going to
charge me with smoking?

208
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,722
- I like murder better.
- Murder?

209
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,347
Nick, help me out here.

210
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,084
Hey, don't look at me, man.

211
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,457
I'm not the one
that got you in this mess.

212
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,223
That blunt puts you
in the one blind spot

213
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,525
where a shark
could have been put

214
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,260
into the water, and according
to Human Resources,

215
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,994
you had access
to the service area, which is

216
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,536
right next to the pool.

217
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,367
A young woman was killed.

218
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,236
That makes you
a co-conspirator.

219
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,775
To a shark?

220
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,434
Yeah.

221
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,843
Man, you Columbos got this all wrong.

222
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,472
I promote Boozell's day clubs.

223
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,312
That's why I have all access,

224
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,852
and the area behind the pool
is where we bring in

225
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,546
the DJ equipment.

226
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,716
Do you guys have any idea

227
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,420
how hard it is to get a job
when you get out the pen?

228
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,655
Boozell took a chance on me

229
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,096
after I was laid off
from my first gig.

230
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,292
Why would I blow that?

231
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,902
The job or the blunt?

232
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,200
Come on, now, got a wife
and kid to support.

233
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,137
And it's not like Macklin's
going to take me back.

234
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,835
You used to work across
the street at Macklin's?

235
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,411
I used to promote his day clubs.

236
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,481
I mean, until I got fired for nothing.

237
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,483
Okay, Macklin's got
an aquarium, sharks,

238
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,177
and a day club
that would benefit

239
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,117
- from Boozell's bad luck.
- Wait a minute.

240
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:34,454
So you think that I put
that shark in that pool

241
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,823
for a guy who fired me?

242
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,190
No, but you and I

243
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,026
both know that if the price is
right, you'd look the other way.

244
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,658
I mean, you do have a wife
and a kid to support. You said it.

245
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:48,797
And if there's one guy who just
can't stay out of jail...

246
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,806
it's you.

247
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,211
Why would this Drops kid

248
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,608
bite the hand that feeds him?

249
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,773
I gave him a job right after
Macklin threw him out.

250
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,181
And my day club
went through the roof.

251
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,449
I'm not one for puns,
but it sounds like you're fishing.

252
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,353
Maybe I am testing
the waters a bit,

253
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,223
trying to get
a little background.

254
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,262
Let's be cards up on this.

255
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,797
Your daddy used to say that.

256
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,424
The rivalry between
you and Macklin,

257
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,470
to insiders like me,
is a bedtime story.

258
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:22,335
I know all about Macklin's
signature property,

259
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,601
the Big Dragon going off,

260
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,574
rattling the windows
of your casino,

261
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,201
and you barging into his office,

262
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,608
demanding that he turn it down.

263
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,716
And what did he do?
He made it even louder.

264
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,718
So, when Macklin built
his topless Euro pool,

265
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,255
you put up a tower that blocked
all of his customers' sun.

266
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,982
What's the problem?

267
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,650
You both have day clubs,

268
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,854
pools, sharks,
and a rivalry that goes back

269
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,965
to when Bugsy set foot
in the desert.

270
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,567
You don't think I put
the shark in my own pool?

271
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,192
That doesn't make sense.

272
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,565
You know the financials.

273
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,674
They just w-walk
across the street.

274
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,540
Macklin.

275
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,975
I'm gonna kill him.

276
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,604
Bit of free advice.

277
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,341
Never say that
in front of a cop.

278
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,779
Shark bites a woman's arm off,
severs the brachial artery.

279
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:10,980
What happens?

280
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,284
She's going to bleed out
into the pool, period.

281
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,915
Which leads us
back to the tooth,

282
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,223
which shows no evidence of
inflammation or any hemorrhaging

283
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,264
in the surrounding soft tissue
where you found it.

284
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,526
Which could only mean she was dead

285
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,101
before the shark ever took a bite.

286
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,999
All right, so if she was dead
before she was bitten,

287
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,197
a shark bites
a dead woman's arm off,

288
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,602
severs an artery.
What happens?

289
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,437
She's going to bleed out
into the pool.

290
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,874
Why? Because the artery's
like a pipe.

291
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,536
The blood's got to go somewhere.

292
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,740
Okay, okay, both things are true.

293
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:41,046
Our victim did not die
of a shark attack.

294
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,849
We are still looking for C.O.D.

295
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,124
Any other signs of trauma
on the body?

296
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,420
Not on the front.

297
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,257
I guess we're gonna
have to flip her.

298
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,290
All righty.

299
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,602
[grunts]

300
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,273
All right.

301
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,852
Oh, injection mark.

302
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,012
Looks like a large-gauge needle.

303
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,124
It would be impossible
to inject yourself

304
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,589
in the middle of
your back like this.

305
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,022
What color was the raft?

306
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,224
Catherine said coral.

307
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,925
Coral it is.

308
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,938
According to <i>Shark Week</i>,
it only takes

309
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,511
a drop of blood to attract a shark
from a hundred miles away.

310
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,806
Which would explain

311
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:45,383
why Desiree was singled out
by the shark.

312
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,451
[woman screams]

313
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,419
That means the shark is only
guilty of biting a dead woman.

314
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,080
Our killer's still out there.

315
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,762
Dr. Ray, it's good
to have you back.

316
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,162
Good to be back, Henry.

317
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,201
Got C.O.D. on
your shark victim.

318
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,360
You were right.

319
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,903
Acute opiate toxicity.

320
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,233
It was a heroin overdose.

321
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,808
Based on metabolites,
she was a first-time user.

322
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,605
- So her first dose was also her last.
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,609
Well, there's obviously
a ton of people in the pool,

324
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,149
and all the angles are terrible.

325
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,616
I do have some shots of Desiree,

326
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,586
but from the time she got on
the raft until she was attacked,

327
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,350
there's no clear shots
of Desiree or her killer.

328
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,720
She's wearing
an awful lot of bling

329
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,884
to be hanging by the pool.

330
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,586
Yeah, right?

331
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,059
Yeah, hang on a second.

332
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,341
She rolls into the pool
looking like Paris Hilton,

333
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,841
but when she comes out,
she's lost her life

334
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,036
and all her jewelry.

335
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,204
Her arm was
devoured by a shark,

336
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,509
which means she was
thrashed about a bit.

337
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,643
So maybe the rest of her jewelry
is at the bottom of the pool.

338
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,420
You and Wendy talk?

339
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,493
Yeah, we talk all the time.

340
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,595
Why?

341
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,163
You talk to Wendy?

342
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,756
It's more like she talks to me.

343
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:10,994
It's not that serious.

344
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,229
She comes to me, we talk.

345
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,634
You know, friends.

346
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:15,967
W-Wait.

347
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,167
W-What kind of friends?

348
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,244
Friend friends
or friends with benefits?

349
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,813
Well, define "benefits."

350
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,845
Um...

351
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,454
I'll load up
and meet you out front.

352
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,529
Is this the "talk later" part?

353
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,826
- Yeah.
- Is it about Henry?

354
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,697
No.

355
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,569
Is it about me?

356
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,806
It's about you and me.

357
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,656
I got a new job.

358
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,752
That's great.

359
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,796
What, they gonna send you
out in the field, or...

360
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,525
It's in Portland with my sister.

361
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,966
Not in Spokane with my niece.

362
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,095
And I get to be a field mouse.

363
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,001
Not a lab rat.

364
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,605
Wow.

365
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,941
Congratulations.

366
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,572
Thank you.

367
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,516
Does anybody
else know about this?

368
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,646
Um, yeah.

369
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,816
Yeah, Catherine was nice enough

370
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,426
to make a couple phone calls for me.

371
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,859
And, um, Henry...

372
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,931
he gave me some advice.

373
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,529
I'm leaving, Hodges.

374
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,699
Yeah.

375
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,774
And I'm the last to know.

376
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,433
Yeah, you're the last to know

377
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,102
because I wanted it that way,

378
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,941
because I knew that
if I told you sooner,

379
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,073
you would get really upset,
and then you'd blame Henry,

380
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:09,711
and you'd try to get me to stay.

381
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,345
And I can't.

382
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,053
Wendy...

383
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,905
Good-bye.

384
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,169
D-Don't.

385
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,350
<i>[Woman on P.A.]</i>
<i>Mr. Macklin, Mr. Danny Macklin,</i>

386
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,392
<i>please pick up</i>
<i>the nearest white courtesy phone.</i>

387
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,052
This is Macklin.

388
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,460
I see.

389
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,159
Strawberry blond, all business.

390
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,201
I think I found her.

391
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,595
Still paging?

392
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,263
Now, that's old school.

393
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,274
I consider myself new school,
but paging is vintage Vegas.

394
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,672
Danny Macklin.

395
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,303
Catherine Willows, CSI.

396
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,313
Please.

397
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,010
CSI, huh?

398
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,950
Let me guess.

399
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,715
The Booze couldn't keep
the sharks in his tank,

400
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,221
and now he's blaming me.

401
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,020
Well, as you know, Mr. Macklin,
day clubs are the hottest ticket in town,

402
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,187
unless of course,
you have a shark-infested pool.

403
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,958
And I know that you have
a stable of sharks.

404
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,694
Would you like to
count my sharks?

405
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,963
Because I can tell you that
if there's a shark missing,

406
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,231
I'd be the first to know.

407
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,738
Yes, but would you tell me?

408
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,741
You know, I wouldn't
put it past the Booze

409
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,471
to drop a shark in his own pool
and try to finger me for it.

410
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,843
Not exactly the smartest ace
in the deck.

411
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,041
More of a joker, actually.

412
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,209
Well, joke's on him,

413
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,617
because his dollars are walking
right through my front door.

414
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,089
Which makes you the prime suspect.

415
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,523
That's enough business.

416
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,822
Why don't, um--
Why don't we get some lunch, huh?

417
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,396
We got a great shark fin soup here.

418
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,055
Can I order you some?

419
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,360
That's one of the biggest reasons

420
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,629
sharks are becoming extinct.

421
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,329
I'll pass.

422
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,833
Thanks for your time, Mr. Macklin.

423
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,640
How long did you know?

424
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,077
Know what?

425
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,013
Wendy was leaving.

426
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,176
She asked my opinion
a couple months ago.

427
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,720
I told her it was a
great opportunity.

428
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,686
So, basically,
you pushed her out the door.

429
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:29,225
You going to Portland, too,
Mr. Friends With Benefits?

430
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,692
Look, Hodges, as
much as you think

431
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,989
it's a one-way street,
it wasn't, all right?

432
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,097
I can't help that
she comes to me

433
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,859
'cause she can't talk to you.

434
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,161
Henry, you might
want to shut up now.

435
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,564
Seriously, you're gonna blame me?

436
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,898
Dude, you're the one
that couldn't close.

437
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,131
- Henry.
- No, you took her out for coffee, right?

438
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,936
And then you can't take her home,
'cause you live at home.

439
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,339
What are you going
to tell your mom,

440
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,740
"Take a ride around the block"?

441
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,674
That's it!

442
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,374
- This is all your fault!
- What are you doing?

443
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,421
Henry?

444
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,121
Henry?

445
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,988
- Henry!
- [gasping]

446
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:10,693
I found the murder weapon.

447
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,763
Good eyes.

448
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,656
Run this through tox.

449
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,986
I want to make sure
it's the same needle

450
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,650
that injected heroin
into our victim.

451
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,355
Okay. As long as you keep
Hodges away from me.

452
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,761
I think I got swimmer's ear.

453
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,924
Hmm?

454
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,229
From-- Forget it.

455
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,807
Hey, Jim, it's Nick.

456
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:35,113
We need to pick up a woman--
Anya Sanchez, FHA,

457
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,745
last known address-- 27321 Barlow.

458
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,085
She's got quite a rap sheet.

459
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,693
I think this may be our girl.

460
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,130
Come on. That's Cartier.

461
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,390
No, no, no, no.

462
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,521
That's robbery.

463
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,693
And this is
your second strike, right?

464
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,236
I mean, that's--
that's quite a pile.

465
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,272
Looks like there's
a few strikes in there.

466
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,874
Then again, all we need
is three, right?

467
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,498
Come on, you guys.

468
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,304
Come on.

469
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,675
I know this game, all right?

470
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,111
You bring me in here.

471
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,580
You lean on me.

472
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,116
You try to get me to plea.

473
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,277
You like that?

474
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,083
You got a Patek Philippe?
I don't know. I'll Check.

475
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,692
- You want to keep that?
- Sure.

476
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,989
How about you take a bracelet
for your little girlfriend?

477
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,689
I got a girlfriend, too.

478
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,424
Be my guest.

479
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,728
Okay.

480
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,167
It's not that easy.

481
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,999
It could be, really.

482
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,198
I don't think you realize

483
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,740
how much trouble you're in.

484
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,674
Do you recognize this girl?

485
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,645
Her name's Desiree McQuire.

486
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,806
I mean, you should.

487
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,814
You're in possession
of her necklace, her rings...

488
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,885
and I think these
are her bracelets.

489
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,181
And I'm going to go out
on a limb here and...

490
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,983
those gold hoop earrings--

491
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,591
those are hers, too.

492
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,651
Okay.

493
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,990
Okay.

494
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,499
Yeah, yeah,
I've been a bad girl.

495
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,594
I admit I got sticky fingers

496
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,866
sometimes, so...

497
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,704
print me, book me, whatever it is.

498
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,436
I'm just going to post bail

499
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,978
and take a few days
off work, so...

500
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,672
You'll need more
than a couple days.

501
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:14,775
I know how you robbed her.

502
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,286
You injected her with heroin.

503
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,481
When she was knocked out,
you picked her clean.

504
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,648
The tough spot is,

505
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,589
your fingerprint
was on the syringe.

506
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,751
And let me guess.

507
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,386
That was a new batch
of heroin, right?

508
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,795
Well, you know...

509
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,459
the weekend cleaned me out,
so I had to improvise.

510
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,338
So I got it from a new seller,
but I didn't sell it,

511
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,534
so... it's just robbery.

512
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,606
Right?

513
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,446
No. No, unfortunately,
Miss McQuire died...

514
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,953
of a heroin overdose.

515
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,716
It's felony murder.

516
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:56,453
You gave her a hot shot, hotshot.

517
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,893
You're right.

518
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,055
You've been a bad girl.

519
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,204
Brass ran Anya Sanchez's
for credit cards.

520
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,705
She's been renting out cabanas

521
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,830
at every pool party in town.

522
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,773
She had quite an attitude
till she realized

523
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,037
she'd gone from thief to murderer,

524
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,339
but I don't think she had anything

525
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,708
to do with our shark attack.

526
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,837
Two separate events.

527
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,382
Yeah, sounds like it.

528
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,076
So we're still chasing the idiot

529
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,447
who put the shark in the water.

530
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,647
Which is attempted murder
on everyone in Boozell's pool.

531
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,088
All right,
based on her condition,

532
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,659
I'd say she's a young one.

533
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:30,920
No more than five or six.

534
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,189
Under normal circumstances,

535
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,958
not exposed to the pool's
filtration system,

536
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,000
she could have lived
another 30 years.

537
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,432
Doctor, care to do the honors?

538
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,435
Why not?

539
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,967
[grunts]

540
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,808
[coughs]

541
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,109
Dr. Langston.

542
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,377
Thank you.

543
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,025
That's-- That's better.

544
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,152
See if you can get
those spreaders in there.

545
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,197
Okay.

546
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,271
That is one huge gut.

547
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,397
She is an eating machine.

548
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,752
- All right. You mind if I take a look?
- Be my guest.

549
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,514
All right, let's see what we got.

550
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:34,182
Now, this shark
is definitely from the wild.

551
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,351
You can tell by the
species she was eating.

552
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,758
You got mackerel...

553
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,024
Here we go. Excuse me.

554
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,259
And some eel.

555
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,268
A little squid.

556
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,532
Ah. Got, uh,
even some baby shark.

557
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,643
Zebra, blacktip.

558
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,404
Found off the Florida Keys.

559
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,413
What I cannot tell you
is how she got here.

560
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,538
There are collectors

561
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,548
who capture sharks
out of the ocean.

562
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,915
They're legit if they have permits.

563
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,852
But the sharks
are almost impossible to track.

564
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,152
Well, thank you, Dr. Holloway.

565
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,419
You've been very helpful.

566
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,495
Gentlemen.

567
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,224
Helpful?

568
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,767
He's not a <i>Shark Week</i> watcher.

569
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,802
Most aquariums get their sharks

570
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,769
from captive breeding programs.

571
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,032
Right.

572
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,236
Hmm.

573
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,507
Where does a wild shark
get freshly-cut pieces of fish?

574
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,550
The doctor's a liar.

575
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:37,451
You know, I've taken the
tour at Mandalay Bay.

576
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,955
You know, the one with
the audio guide to your ear.

577
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,319
- I hate those things.
- I love them.

578
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,756
You learn stuff.

579
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,759
Sharks in captivity have to be tagged.

580
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:49,196
It's like bringing a D.B.
into autopsy without a toe tag.

581
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,065
I am telling you, this shark was
shark-napped out of some casino.

582
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,069
I believe you, Doc.

583
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,815
You ever known shark
skin to be smooth?

584
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,883
Feel that... right there.

585
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,146
Hmm. It's almost as if it was sanded down.

586
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,449
Well, if you can do it
with the VIN number of a car,

587
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,921
why not a shark?

588
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:44,283
Genus-- <i>Galeocerdo.</i>
Species-- <i>cuvier.</i>

589
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,617
<i>Galeocerdo Cuvier...</i> G.C.

590
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,555
So the first two letters of the I.D.

591
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,058
are genus and species.

592
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,390
Right.
The next two numbers denote

593
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,623
the year that the shark
was purchased.

594
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,563
1-0 means 2010.

595
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,795
And 0-3 means it
was the third tiger shark

596
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,236
purchased for that
particular aquarium.

597
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,567
And there are only a handful

598
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:07,667
of aquariums in Vegas
that have sharks.

599
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,781
I've got the list right here.

600
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,282
And I think I know
who I'm going to talk to first.

601
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,785
[Langston]
Well, Mr. Macklin,

602
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,482
that is your shark.

603
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,992
At least, it was your shark
until it took a dip

604
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,324
in Mr. Boozell's pool.

605
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,364
And, Mr. Macklin,

606
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,900
let me remind you
of your own words.

607
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,560
"If there's a shark
missing from my property,

608
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,138
I'd be the first to know."

609
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,272
Here's the thing.

610
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:43,073
As of, uh, yesterday,
I'm not missing a shark.

611
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:46,411
But, last week,
I had a shark with a tapeworm.

612
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:47,575
Excuse me?

613
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,085
Yeah, I got a $50,000 shark
that's eating me out of house and home,

614
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,519
eating all my baby sharks.

615
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,783
Do you know how much it costs

616
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,688
to ship a zebra
or blacktip to Vegas?

617
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:59,490
- How much?
- 15 grand a fish. Yeah.

618
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,532
And this tiger shark is eating
them up like potato chips.

619
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,999
See, my goal on my property

620
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,535
is to provide a tranquil aquarium

621
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,036
for my guests as they check in.

622
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,870
And instead, I've got
a 200-pound eating machine

623
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,204
that's tearing up my tank

624
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,539
before my guests can even get
their freaking key cards.

625
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,138
So I, uh, checked the shark out early.
I got rid of it.

626
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,808
- How did you get rid of it?
- I called my guy,

627
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,442
the guy who takes care of my fish.

628
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,885
- Um... Aquavet.
- Dr. Holloway.

629
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,320
He handles all the properties.

630
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,856
He came by, picked it up.

631
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,482
Oh, and, uh,
speaking of my words,

632
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:33,119
it went a little something like this...

633
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,028
"You get that disposal
with a fin off my property,

634
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,862
before I turn it
into a buffet special."

635
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,630
- I got something to say!
- You gotta be kidding me!

636
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,796
You think I don't know cops with cell phones?

637
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,908
Who do you think dimed you out
to let me know you're here?

638
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,168
I'm on to you, Macklin.
I want a piece of you.

639
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,470
You feelin' tough?
You want a piece of me? Okay...

640
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,306
- You want too far this time with that shark.
- You just keep talking.

641
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,914
- You crossed the line.
- It's all going on record. You keep talking.

642
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,880
Gentlemen!

643
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,314
This interview's over.

644
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,544
Escort them out of here.

645
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,178
Come on, let's go.

646
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,798
Talk about shark-infested waters.

647
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,346
Bring it back when you
take the boot off.

648
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,722
Send a stretch.

649
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,889
Yeah, Catherine, we got a bead
on Dr. Holloway.

650
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,998
His office said he's working
at Macklin's property,

651
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,724
but we can't seem
to get him on the phone,

652
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,459
so he must be in the water.

653
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,127
We'll call you as soon as we
find out something else.

654
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,364
There you are.

655
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,030
Mom, Mom, I got it.

656
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,368
It's so cool.

657
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,272
I got a great picture!
Come on!

658
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,777
Awfully fired up about taking
a picture of a fish.

659
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,779
Well, you know,
fish are beautiful.

660
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,183
- Not when you're sleeping with them.
- It's Dr. Holloway.

661
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,346
Well, that explains
why his cell phone

662
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,821
went straight to voice mail.

663
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,502
First blush?

664
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,901
Pink.

665
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,941
What caused it?

666
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,340
Could be carbon dioxide,

667
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,675
carbon monoxide, cyanide.

668
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,510
Dealer's choice, pal.

669
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,198
Hey. Where do you want this?

670
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,324
Why don't you
put it in my mouth

671
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,198
and shoot it
with a high-powered rifle?

672
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,362
No way, man.

673
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,803
Last thing I need's
another explosion.

674
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,135
I'm just starting
to get my hearing back.

675
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,508
I got to buck up.
I got to get my shark face on.

676
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,705
Get tough.

677
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,975
Good. You know, I have
a tough job for a tough guy.

678
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,345
Excellent.

679
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,180
I need to keep my mind off Wendy.

680
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,878
Okay, test the contents

681
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,546
of the tank with quants, please.

682
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,851
Want to give me a heads up,
let me know what I'm looking for?

683
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,120
Whatever turned our suspect
into the Pink Panther.

684
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,728
Mmm.

685
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,263

It's CO poisoning--
carbon monoxide.

701
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,107
Someone tampered
with Holloway's scuba tank.

702
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,736
I can tell you how.

703
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,940
Also found hydrocarbons
and nitrous oxides.

704
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,018
Both are by-products
of an internal combustion engine.

705
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,553
You're saying somebody filled
his scuba tank

706
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,178
with car exhaust?

707
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,620
Well, it's not that hard really.

708
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,020
You just take
the compressor intake,

709
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,526
put it next to the exhaust,
and you're in business.

710
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,222
Even one percent of carbon
monoxide can kill you.

711
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,993
It binds 200 times tighter
to hemoglobin than oxygen,

712
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,125
preventing the O2
from being distributed

713
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,760
and absorbed by the body.

714
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,372
And you suffocate.

715
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:36,564
Yeah, and you turn pink.

716
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,073
We know that
it was Macklin's shark

717
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,235
that ended up in Boozell's pool.

718
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,869
Probably put there by Dr. Holloway,

719
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,107
who worked
for both Macklin and Boozell.

720
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:49,185
So, who stood to gain more
by the doctor's untimely death,

721
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,912
the Booze or the Mack?

722
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,149
Let's run both scenarios.
I'm the Mack.

723
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,589
I call up the aqua vet and I say,

724
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,159
"Hey, man, you wanna make
a little extra cash?

725
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,287
"Sand the number
off the reject shark from my tank,

726
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,625
"throw it in Boozell's pool

727
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,233
"so I that I can steal
all his customers.

728
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,427
Only don't tell the cops."
Oops.

729
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,198
Or I'm the Booze,

730
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,897
and I call the aqua vet and I say,

731
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,770
"Hey, I know Macklin paid you

732
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,036
"to put that shark
into my pool to ruin me.

733
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,770
You're a dead man."

734
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:16,971
Who's got better motive?

735
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,810
We let the evidence decide.

736
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,646
Ask the gentlemen
to start their engines.

737
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,845
I think I can narrow
that down a bit.

738
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,988
Based on the ratio
of contaminants

739
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,992
found in the exhaust,
we're looking for an older car.

740
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,995
Pre-'70s... vintage.

741
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,192
Okay, Joe.

742
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,563
[Willows]
Everyone in Vegas knows

743
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,637
that you have a collection
of classic cars.

744
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,739
You parade them up and down
the Strip every year.

745
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,274
Your '64 Aston Martin

746
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,639
is pre-catalytic converter.

747
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,008
Puts out plenty of carbon monoxide.

748
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,740
The ratios of hydrocarbons

749
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,875
and nitrous oxides matches
the ratios that we found

750
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,680
in Dr. Holloway's scuba tank.

751
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,551
Willows, I flunked science.

752
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,558
Are you trying to say
that my car killed Holloway?

753
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,719
Why would it do that?

754
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,626
Because you knew
that Macklin gave back a shark,

755
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,233
and you knew who he gave it to--
the aqua vet.

756
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,995
And you figured
that Macklin and the aqua vet

757
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,036
were in cahoots,
so you had him whacked.

758
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,936
You want to talk old school,
that's dinosaur times.

759
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,474
I'd rather not state the obvious,

760
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,204
but my hotel is hot,

761
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,938
crawling with cops.

762
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,571
I can't walk through my casino

763
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,707
without bumping
into you and that other one.

764
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,978
You got the wrong guy.

765
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,747
Well, then how did the exhaust
from your vehicle end up

766
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,321
in Dr. Holloway's tank?

767
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:36,415
What am I, one of those
<i>MythBusters</i> guys?

768
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,461
I don't know.

769
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:43,499
Look, when I was younger,
the tit for tat was better than sex.

770
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,727
But these days
it just gives me indigestion.

771
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,273
So when Macklin invited me to
dinner last night, I accepted.

772
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,434
And when he said, "Let's
bury the hatchet," I said,

773
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,773
"Consider it squashed."

774
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,039
We broke bread.

775
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,445
His joint-- Carne's.

776
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,881
That used to mean something.

777
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,542
Well, it doesn't mean
that you're off the hook.

778
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,350
Willows, I'm telling you, cards up,

779
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,617
all I can give you is my word.

780
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,727
That used
to mean something, too.

781
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,918
Sorry to hear about your friend.

782
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,488
Good news is she came to you,

783
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,591
and now it's squashed.

784
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,751
But remember one thing, Mugs...

785
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,124
just because you say
it's squashed,

786
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,731
doesn't mean it's squashed.

787
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,835
Remember that, Catherine.

788
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,526
Evening, ladies.

789
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,993
Oh, this is my spot.

790
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,688
But don't go anywhere.
I'll need you.

791
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,696
Hey, maybe I should call Mr. Macklin.

792
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,358
Uh, on second thought, follow me.

793
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,027
Any surveillance on property?

794
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,433
Only inside.

795
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,938
And every car you valet
ends up where?

796
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,702
In the lot.

797
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,208
And what about the boss's cars,

798
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,778
or the boss's friends' cars?

799
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,676
We keep 'em right here.
Easy access. No waiting.

800
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,975
Can I go now, ladies?

801
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,674
No.

802
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,015
You were right, Catherine.
I think I got something here.

803
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,161
Hmm.

804
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,661
Uh, what is this?

805
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,789
I don't know.
I just park cars.

806
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,094
Smells like exhaust.

807
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,930
Are you sure that
you didn't see somebody

808
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,265
using this last night?

809
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,262
No.

810
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,476
Oh, Sara, I think we've got
ourselves an eyewitness.

811
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,875
Yeah.

812
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,008
[Willows]
You know the thing about ATM machines?

813
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,553
They take pictures every 15 seconds.

814
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,988
And you know what they say
about tiger sharks?

815
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,822
They can't close their mouths.

816
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:25,986
Really?

817
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,961
Neither can valet parkers.

818
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,000
And this one gave you up faster
than a natural Blackjack.

819
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,330
[whispers]
No comment.

820
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,770
- No comment.
- That's beautiful.

821
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,308
Beautiful.
Let me tell you a story.

822
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,309
How about you spare me
and not tell me a story?

823
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,414
Once upon a time,
there was this two-bit mogul

824
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,517
who made a cheap play for a shark.

825
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,278
He had buyer's remorse,

826
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,115
so he thought he'd pawn it
off on his veterinarian.

827
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,779
But then he had a better idea.

828
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,788
He thought,
"Maybe I'll make some money."

829
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,256
After all, it is Vegas.

830
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,692
"Maybe I'll make the money back
that I spent on the shark

831
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,662
and stick it to my enemy
at the same time."

832
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,027
Earnest Boozell.

833
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,759
So in order to make
this scam work,

834
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,164
he needs the help
of the veterinarian.

835
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,897
The veterinarian
has the key to Boozell's property

836
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,597
and a means to dump it.

837
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,504
How am I doing so far, Catherine?

838
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,803
Give him a couple more bites.

839
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,970
The aqua vet, he's the victim.

840
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,445
He's not very bright.

841
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,040
He was trying to remove
the VIN number from the fin...

842
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,949
the "fin" number...

843
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,682
because he thought that way,
we couldn't trace the shark back to you.

844
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,190
Because if there was
a missing shark on your property,

845
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,953
you'd be the first to know, right?

846
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,029
I don't know what kind
of financial arrangement

847
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,563
you had with the veterinarian,

848
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,290
but something happened,

849
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,799
and he had to go.

850
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,095
But you thought
you'd cover your tracks,

851
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,362
so you tampered
with his scuba gear.

852
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,667
And you thought you'd lay
that off on Boozell, as well.

853
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,834
Why'd you do that?
I thought it was "squashed"?

854
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,844
So now our story comes to an end.

855
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,279
You're going down for murder...

856
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,749
hook, line, and sinker.

857
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,264
[Boozell]
Now you know the little secret.

858
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,267
Everyone thinks
that this is for the guests,

859
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,837
but it's really for me.

860
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,066
[Willows]
Spoken like a free man.

861
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,370
I was wrong about you.

862
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,877
I thought you were
just like your old man.

863
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,640
How's that?

864
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:25,976
Passionate, hardworking,

865
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,048
driven by money?

866
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,879
Two out of the three.

867
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,577
Which two?

868
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,417
Passionate, hardworking.

869
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,889
The truth is,
I'm driven by the money, too,

870
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,357
just like your father.

871
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,122
But you're not.

872
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,992
You're different than us.

873
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:45,192
Now I can see where
the greatness comes from.

874
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,032
Thank you... for the compliment.

875
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,369
Squashed?

876
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,573
I don't swim with sharks.
