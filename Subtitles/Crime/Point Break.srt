How?

779
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:14,828
He positioned his small

780
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:17,036
between a Norwegian whaling ship

781
00:58:17,038 --> 00:58:19,327

That's when I lost
control of the motorcycle

902

and crashed into the river.

903
01:09:37,164 --> 01:09:39,581
By the time I got back to
the surface and the riverbank,

904
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:43,934
he was gone.

905
01:09:50,124 --> 01:09:53,834
Your orders were to investigate and report.

906
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:56,029
So now I got another situation.

907
01:09:57,068 --> 01:10:00,523
$100 million in gold ore
lost from Grauman Minerals,

908
01:10:00,525 --> 01:10:02,763
which as you know, is
another multi-national

910
01:10:04,973 --> 01:10:06,442
And I got the Director on my ass

911
01:10:06,444 --> 01:10:09,195
sending me here from D.C. to end this.

912
01:10:09,197 --> 01:10:10,461
So my question...

913
01:10:11,949 --> 01:10:15,210
Why did you not follow
your instructions, son?

914
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:16,875
I'd earned their trust,
sir, and I wanted to be sure

915
01:10:16,877 --> 01:10:18,794
they were the suspects.

916
01:10:18,796 --> 01:10:22,283
So your m.o. is to help
them commit another crime?

917
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:24,554
No! Not at all. I wanted to stop them.

918
01:10:24,556 --> 01:10:26,046
- Yeah...
- I tried to stop them.

919
01:10:27,341 --> 01:10:30,315
Bodhi doesn't see these as crimes.

920
01:10:30,317 --> 01:10:32,522
He thinks of them as offerings.

921
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:34,155
Offerings? What the hell does that mean?

922
01:10:34,157 --> 01:10:37,034
What the hell does that even mean?

923
01:10:37,036 --> 01:10:39,658
These guys are trying to
complete the Ozaki Eight.

924
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,539
They see that as a gift
given to them from the Earth.

925
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:44,042
To balance out that gift,
they want to give back

926
01:10:44,044 --> 01:10:45,387
something taken from the Earth.

927
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:46,635
This case, it was gold ore

928
01:10:46,637 --> 01:10:48,029
that was ripped out of the ground.

929
01:10:50,573 --> 01:10:53,098

<i>They've taken Ozaki's

938

They think they're crusaders
with a worthy cause.

939
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:16,971
They're more than willing to die for it.

940

941
