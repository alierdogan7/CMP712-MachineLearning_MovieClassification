- Well, Chief, I...

184

My son just walked in,

- A phone,
- Why is it attached to my ear?

198
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:02,785
- 'Cause you're talking on it?
- Which means you are...

199
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:05,949
- Interrupting your conversation?
- That's my genius,

200
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:09,222
OK, Mr, Genius, What I'd like is all your homework done, on my desk,

Men, Not the boys I go to school with,

00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:36,643
Right, Men, OK?

220
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:42,585
Men see this sort of outfit as a sexual invitation, That's all I'm saying,

- Empty,

If I change what I'm wearing,

224
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:12,884
- will you give me $40 for tonight?
- If that doesn't remind me of your mother,

225
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,284
How about you change what you're wearing,

226

464
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:14,040
I turned it over to County, so I'm not there anymore,

465
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:18,077
Look, I know you're busy, but can you stop by for a little bit?

466
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:20,614
I think I can, yeah,

467
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:24,591
I have to go by Carol's,

468
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:26,823
She had a kid,

469

<i>It's not your fault she's dead, Jeff.</i>

470

Yeah,

<i>- So, what was the argument about?
- Oh, you know. What it's always about.</i>

474
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:48,978
She's afraid we're gonna get divorced,

475
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:51,044
<i>What do you think, Jane?</i>

476
00:40:52,223 --> 00:40:54,521
<i>You think we're gonna get divorced?</i>

477
00:40:55,026 --> 00:40:57,221
<i>- No.

480
00:41:04,802 --> 00:41:06,793

484
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:16,458
we're not gonna hurt you, Do you understand?

485
00:43:17,768 --> 00:43:20,032
What do you want?

486
00:43:20,104 --> 00:43:25,201
I want you to put your hands on the roof of the car,

487
00:43:38,222 --> 00:43:40,588
Pardon me,

488
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:49,699
Now, would you mind putting your left hand through the steering wheel, please?

489
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,164
Now bring me the right,

490
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:59,232
Good,

491
00:44:01,846 --> 00:44:04,314
Good,

492
00:44:04,382 --> 00:44:07,476
Now the guy behind you is gonna take hold of you,

493
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,113
Don't struggle, It's for your own good, Please,

But at least they're still alive,

499
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,791
From this point on, you control what happens to them,

500
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:57,257
Can we let you go?

501
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:00,530
Can you be calm?

502
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,201
Good, Good,

503
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:18,549
Now, listen to me, I want you to go back to Walter Smith's house,

504
00:45:18,622 --> 00:45:24,117
There's a DVD inside Walter Smith's house that belongs to me,

505
00:45:24,195 --> 00:45:25,822
I'm no longer in command,

506
00:45:25,896 --> 00:45:31,129
You are going to reassume command until my people arrive to finish the job,

507
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:34,968
You're not gonna let anyone go into the house or anything come out,

508
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,564
Are you with me so far?

509
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:39,632
How am I gonna do that?

510
00:45:40,745 --> 00:45:45,614
You... are the famous Jeff Talley,

511
00:45:46,484 --> 00:45:50,887
Ten years SWAT, seven years prime hostage negotiator,

512
00:45:50,955 --> 00:45:52,946
You'll figure it out,

513
00:45:56,327 --> 00:46:01,959
When this white phone rings, it'll be me with further instructions,

514
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:06,163
If you deviate from the plan one little bit,

515
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:08,364
I will kill your wife,

516
00:46:09,373 --> 00:46:11,773
And then I will kill your child,

517
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:17,574
But when I have what I want, you get your family back,

518
00:46:21,385 --> 00:46:23,717
Here,

519
00:46:23,788 --> 00:46:28,054
Now, you wait until our van is gone before you uncuff yourself,

520
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:30,616

524
00:47:36,694 --> 00:47:38,525
I was gonna turn him over to the Sheriff's,

525
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:42,259
but he says he saw you on TV and he wants to speak with you,

526

Slow down, slow down, slow down,
Slow down, Tommy, Slow down,

<i>I'm really, really scared, and you gotta help us.</i>

531

Slow down and take it easy,

532
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:00,212
Was your dad shot?

533
00:48:00,284 --> 00:48:03,014
<i>Dennis hit him a bunch of times with his gun.</i>

534
00:48:03,087 --> 00:48:04,952
<i>- He hit my dad.
- Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!</i>

535
00:48:05,022 --> 00:48:07,923
<i>- He needs a doctor.
- Try and talk quietly, OK?</i>

536
00:48:07,992 --> 00:48:09,619
<i>- Just take it easy,
- OK.</i>

537
00:48:09,693 --> 00:48:12,253
All right, Are you in a safe place?

538

They think I'm tied up, but I got free.</i>

Wait, Tommy,
How do you know they can't hear you?

540
00:48:19,937 --> 00:48:23,395
<i>'Cause I can see them on the security channel.</i>

541
00:48:23,474 --> 00:48:25,499
Tell me everything you can see on the TV,

00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,235
I see Dennis,

543
00:48:28,312 --> 00:48:30,576
I see Kevin,

Smith's not talking,

Is Smith not talking because you won't let him?

626

- It's not my fault.</i>

- Chief Talley?
- Yeah, I'm still here, Tommy,

801
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:35,234
Dennis... he found my daddy's Benjamins,

802
01:07:36,236 --> 01:07:38,534
What's a Benjamin?

803
01:07:38,605 --> 01:07:41,938
A Benjamin is a hundred-dollar bill, Tommy,

804
01:07:42,009 --> 01:07:44,273
How many Benjamins does your daddy have?

805

Yeah, son, A good friend of mine is watching over him,

Mr, Smith, my name is Jeff Talley,

I'm the chief of police here in Bristo Camino,

823
01:08:45,772 --> 01:08:49,105
I've been talking to your son, Tommy,

824
01:08:49,176 --> 01:08:53,374
He's still inside the house, along with his sister Jennifer,

825
01:08:54,014 --> 01:08:57,916
I know you know the kind of young men they're dealing with,

826
01:09:01,855 --> 01:09:04,323
I need that DVD, Mr, Smith,

827
01:09:05,325 --> 01:09:07,919
You know what I'm talking about,

828
01:09:10,497 --> 01:09:12,522
You save my children,

829
01:09:12,599 --> 01:09:15,500
Of course I want to save your family,

830
01:09:19,272 --> 01:09:23,732
But the only way I can do it is if I get that DVD,

<i>Tommy, I have to ask you a grown-up question now, OK?</i>

840
01:10:12,559 --> 01:10:14,151
OK,

841
01:10:14,227 --> 01:10:16,661
If you could do it safely,

842
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:20,962
and only if you could do it safely,

843
01:10:22,836 --> 01:10:25,805
could you get into your daddy's office without anyone seeing you?

844
01:10:25,872 --> 01:10:28,864
I guess so, But my daddy says I'm never ever supposed to go in there,

845
01:10:28,942 --> 01:10:30,967
Shh, Keep your voice down, buddy,

846

Keep your voice down, Remember?

847
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,371
<i>OK. OK.</i>

848
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:43,313
- Tommy, do you like to play video games?
- Yeah,

849
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:44,880
<i>Do you?</i>

850
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,949
What kind of games do you play?

851
01:10:47,027 --> 01:10:53,227
I like Monster Jam, I play Bounty Hunter, I play Wubba Zorg...

852
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,598
Wubba Zorg, I know Wubba Zorg,

853
01:10:56,603 --> 01:10:59,094
I know that game,

854
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,572
That means you know who Agent Zero is, right?

855
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:04,508
<i>Yeah.</i>

856
01:11:04,578 --> 01:11:07,604
What do you think Agent Zero would do right now?

857
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:10,013
Do you think he would say "never ever," Tommy?

858
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:11,573
No, he wouldn't say "never,"

859
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:16,088
Agent Zero would help Captain Wubba save Planet Xenon,

860
01:11:16,156 --> 01:11:18,954
Are you like Captain...
Are you like Captain Wubba?

861
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,126
<i>And my house is Planet Xenon.</i>

862

<i>Right?</i>

864
01:11:37,944 --> 01:11:39,935
Yeah, Tommy,

865
01:11:41,514 --> 01:11:44,881
Captain Wubba's gonna save Planet Xenon,

866
01:11:45,518 --> 01:11:47,315
<i>But I need your help.</i>

867
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:50,319
Well, the most efficient entry point is here, The pool area,

868
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,292
Four-man team ropes in, Silent entry through one of the skylights here,

869
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:55,851
All right,

870
01:11:55,929 --> 01:11:59,865
I put the doer and the two boys here in the courtyard, I keep the two kids in the house,

871
01:11:59,933 --> 01:12:03,892
- How much time you need for the play?
- Two minutes,

872
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:06,165
Say you can get the hostages to the pool area,

873
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,606
How are you gonna get all three suspects to this side of the house?

874
01:12:09,676 --> 01:12:13,544
Well, we're about to jump off that bridge,
aren't we?

Dennis?

880
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,118
Dennis?

881
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,398
What do you want?

882
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:09,992
You by yourself?

883
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:14,463
Yeah,

884
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:16,771
We got a problem, Dennis,

885
01:13:16,843 --> 01:13:18,743
Oh, yeah?

886
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:20,803
Yeah,

887
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:24,173
Walter Smith just died,

888
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:31,719
Hear what I said?

889
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:34,021
Yeah,

890
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:40,266
I know Mars killed my cop, but Smith's death is on you, man,

891
01:13:42,068 --> 01:13:46,198
Things just got a lot more complicated, didn't they, Dennis?

892
01:13:46,272 --> 01:13:50,231
Not to mention the fact that helicopters are very expensive,

893
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:53,746
Gotta pay for the fuel, the pilot...

894
01:13:54,748 --> 01:13:57,342
chief of police,

895
01:13:57,417 --> 01:14:00,750
You know what cops do when they retire, Dennis?

896
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,084
They play golf,

897
01:14:03,156 --> 01:14:06,990
I don't want to play golf, I hate fucking golf,

898
01:14:08,561 --> 01:14:10,756
I want a house on the golf course,

899
01:14:11,765 --> 01:14:13,596
I want that,

900
01:14:15,402 --> 01:14:18,769
Walter Smith talked to me before he died,

901
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,105
I know about the money,

902
01:14:22,175 --> 01:14:25,975
I don't know shit about money, man, I don't know shit about what you're talking about,

903
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,036
I'm talking about a transaction,

904
01:14:28,114 --> 01:14:32,551
You want a helicopter, I want a house on the golf course,

905
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:39,418
Fifty thousand,

906
01:14:39,492 --> 01:14:41,619
Maybe you can negotiate with the sheriffs for that,

907
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:43,628
No, No!

908
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:45,687
No,

909
01:14:46,966 --> 01:14:48,957
Shit,

910
01:14:50,637 --> 01:14:53,162
Half,

911
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,230
I'll give you half, OK?

912
01:14:57,544 --> 01:15:01,810
That's, like... two million, OK?
Half is good,

913
01:15:01,881 --> 01:15:05,840
All right, Sell it to your crew,

914
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,353
Jennifer and Tommy stay in the house,

915
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,481
The three of you down here in the courtyard,

916
01:15:11,558 --> 01:15:14,083
I'll trade the helicopter for the cash,

917
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,754
How do I know the pilot's not gonna shoot me?

918
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,492
Let me worry about the pilot,

919
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:23,698
You just make sure he gets that bag, understand?

920
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:26,364
Yeah,

921
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,430

What... What if they just want to get us outside just to shoot us?

932
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,547
They could have killed us, like, a million times, Kev,

933
01:16:45,618 --> 01:16:47,643
But they didn't, because Talley wants to get paid,

What's this? This wasn't what we discussed,

This wasn't what we talked about,

950
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:23,913
Three people in the chopper,
That's all it can carry, Dennis,

951
01:18:23,983 --> 01:18:27,942
I thought you were the man in charge,
Isn't that what you told me?

952
01:18:28,021 --> 01:18:31,184
- You said, "I'm the man,"
- I am the man! I am in charge!

Jenny and I aren't going nowhere,

Dennis, The man that owns this house is a criminal,

956
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:42,934
So are his friends,
This money belongs to them,

957
01:18:43,002 --> 01:18:45,630
- You want more money?
- They'll come after you and fuckin' kill you,

958

You want more fucking money?

959
01:18:46,906 --> 01:18:48,931
You just chose the wrong house on the wrong day,

960
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:50,339
- I'm not lying,
- Bullshit,

961
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:54,210
The only thing I lied to you about was Smith,

962
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,771
He's not dead, You didn't kill anybody,

963
01:18:56,849 --> 01:18:59,215
That means that you and your brother can still beat the hard shit,

964

Put those guns down and walk out now,

The situation has clearly gotten away from you,

1001

Your flagrant disregard for protocol

1002
01:21:50,289 --> 01:21:54,316
has unnecessarily placed yourself and my officers in the line of fire,

1003
01:21:54,393 --> 01:21:59,763
My opinion? You remain in command, there's a probability of a negative outcome,

Walter, you're looking fairly banged-up as well,
