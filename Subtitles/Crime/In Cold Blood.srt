1
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,282
Excuse me.

2
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,688
Pa?

3
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,241
You all right, Pa?

4
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,442
-You're up early.
-I got a big day ahead.

5
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:15,360
I wish you didn't have to go.

6
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:17,963
I promised to help this friend.

7
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,887
Goddamn outhouse.

8
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:24,362
One of these days soon,
l'm changing all that.

9
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:26,083
Damn soon.

10
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,481
You drive careful now.

11
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,763
Young man? Young man.
I'm terribly sorry.

12
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,920
Ma'am, can l have a root beer?

13
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,160
-Anything else to go with that?
-Some aspirins, please.

14
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,442
"Friend P. ca.me out in August...

15
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,483
"...a.nd a.fter you left, l met someone.

16
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:22,040
"He put me onto something
we could bring off bea.utiful.

17
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,718
"A cinch, the perfect score.

18
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:29,600
"lt's a. sure thing. Am depending on you.

19
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,444
"Love, Dick.

20
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:34,646
"P.S. Will meet your bus, November 14.

21
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:38,321
"M-da.y. 'M' for money, honey. "

22
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:45,247
Fill her up, buddy.

23
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:47,926
You sure got a perfect day for it.

24
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,563
-What's that?
-Hunting pheasants.

25
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:53,408
Yes, indeedy.

26
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:55,360
Deadeye Dick Hickock?

27
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:59,164
Them birds don't know it,
but this is their last day on Earth.

28
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:15,602
Good morning, Daddy.

29
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:19,279
-Well, you're up early.
-I've got a furious day ahead.

30
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,644
'Morning, Dad.

31
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,282
-Thought maybe l smelled smoke.
-Yeah.

32
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,168
Me, too. Could be a leaky valve.

33
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,197
Could be.

34
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:53,767
Peppermints before breakfast
might stunt your growth.

35
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,727
Daddy, phone.

36
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,486
It's the insurance man.

37
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:01,678
This afternoon, anytime before dark.

38
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:07,644
Hello?

39
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:10,727
I want to call
the Kansas State Penitentiary.

40
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:16,599
Person-to-person. Rev. James Post.

41
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:20,597
Rev. James Post.

42
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:23,922
My name is....

43
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,486
Perry Smith.
He'll be checking in sometime tomorrow.

44
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,084
-Can l see the room, please?
-Ain't you working today?

45
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,365
Now, ain't you?

46
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:39,877
Hello.

47
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,882
Perry.

48
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,720
Of course, l remember you.

49
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,117
Kansas City?

50
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:51,683
Missouri.

51
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,966
I'm at the bus terminal.

52
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,405
I'm waiting for Willie Jay.

53
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,124
Did something hold up his parole?

54
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:08,964
-I was supposed to meet him right here.
-Perry, think.

55
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:11,798
You've already broken parole
by quitting your job.

56
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:14,364
You'll break it again
if you step into Kansas.

57
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:17,521
Whatever you do,
don't cross that river into Kansas.

58
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,879
Can you tell me where he went?

59
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,002
Please, Jim.

60
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,761
It's very important.

61
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:35,723
Maybe the most important thing in my life.

62
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:39,287
Go back. Why not see your father?

63
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,926
'Morning, Ma.

64
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:57,757
Daddy, you know Jolene?

65
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:00,488
I promised to teach her
how to bake a cherry pie.

66
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:03,208
-Sounds serious.
-She insists on today.

67
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,849
That makes it practically a catastrophe.

68
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:09,799
Because l also promised
to help Roxy with her trumpet solo.

69
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,438
And errands for Mother in Garden City,
lunch with Susan--

70
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:16,566
Suppose l take care
of your mother's errands?

71
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:18,637
Thank you, Daddy.

72
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:38,439
Also provided for your convenience,
a.t the ba.gga.ge counter...

73
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,724
...a.re identifica.tion ta.gs.

74
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,040
This is your la.st ca.Il...

75
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:48,162
...for Buckner, Bluffington, Lexington,
Wa.verly, Ma.rsha.Il...

76
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:51,480
...a.nd intermedia.te flights.

77
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:54,482
Now boa.rding a.t door number six.

78
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,527
Stick 'em up!

79
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,237
-Hey, buddy.
-How long have you been standing there?

80
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:02,445
Long enough to catch your late late show.

81
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,362
-Just between you and l.
-You and me.

82
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:08,839
How come you always go into a trance
every time you look in the mirror?

83
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:12,160
Just like you was looking
at some gorgeous piece of butt.

84
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:16,525
What in the hell is in here?

85
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,163
Concrete?

86
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:22,162
That's all my stuff. Books, letters, songs.

87
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,561
Souvenirs from Korea.

88
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,444
And our ticket to fame and fortune.

89
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,724
I got a secret map that's going to lead us...

90
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,642
...straight to the sunken treasure
of Captain Cortés.

91
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:36,438
$60 million in Spanish gold,
off the coast of Mexico.

92
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:38,844
So, that's why that map's
so frigging heavy.

93
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,405
Welcome back to Kansas, buddy.
The heart of America.

94
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:47,128
The land of wheat, corn, bibles, and...

95
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,167
...natural gas.

96
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:55,319
That map's not as heavy as yours,
but it's the real thing.

97
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:58,959
And it's gonna get us $10,000 by tonight.

98
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:03,283
Four hundred miles west of here,
Big Daddy Clutter's place.

99
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:07,279
That's the layout. The works.

100
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:10,403
Somewhere in that office,
in one little old safe.

101
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:13,720
And inside that safe, $10,000, maybe more.

102
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:15,922
You've seen it?

103
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,117
The safe!

104
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:22,241
Right after you left the zoo,
a new guy moved into the cell.

105
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,923
Floyd Wells,
serving three to five for robbery.

106
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:28,437
He once worked for Clutter. He saw it.

107
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,119
And that's your perfect score?

108
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:33,047
Baby, it's a cinch.

109
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:38,287
I promise you, honey,
we'll blast hair all over them walls.

110
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,240
-Hello, Roxy.
-'Morning, Mr. Clutter.

111
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:56,445
I think Nancy's expecting you.

112
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:38,958
You want to watch it, boy.
You'll end up an aspirin junkie.

113
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:42,485
Been one for seven years.
Got the habit in the hospital.

114
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:44,598
Doctors.

115
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,765
They made a dwarf out of me.

116
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:51,125
Doctors and lawyers. What do they care?

117
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:55,446
Ever see a millionaire
fry in the electric chair?

118
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:56,763
Hell, no.

119
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,606
There's two kinds of laws, honey:

120
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:02,888
One for the rich and one for the poor.

121
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:06,488
Look at me.

122
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:08,918
I crack up my car,
wake up in a charity ward...

123
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,806
...and don't even recognize myself.

124
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,240
I hate to count how much classy pussy
that's cost me.

125
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,887
They left you a wonderful smile, though.

126
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,485
Yeah, the all-American boy.

127
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:13,722
That was stupid.

128
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:17,127
Stealing a lousy pack of razor blades,
to prove what?

129
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,598
Everybody steals something sometime.

130
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:23,444
It's the national pastime, baby.
Stealing and cheating.

131
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,209
If they caught every cheating wife
and tax chiseler...

132
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,678
...the whole country
would be behind prison walls.

133
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:31,442
-Where are the black stockings?
-They didn't have black.

134
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,963
-Stop someplace else.
-Where?

135
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,684
-A Catholic hospital.
-Sure.

136
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,647
We'll just barge in like it was
a goddamn five-and-dime.

137
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:44,125
Sister, sweetie, we gotta have
some black stockings to hide our face.

138
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,642
Okay, forget it.

139
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,809
Anyway, nuns are bad luck.

140
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:51,761
Kind of sexy, though.

141
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:55,046
You wouldn't think so if you'd lived
in one of those orphan homes...

142
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:57,643
...with those black widows always at you.

143
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:01,039
Always sneaking up in the dark,
spying while you sleep.

144
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,481
Hitting you with a flashlight
for wetting the bed.

145
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,320
That's the first time
l was saved by the yellow bird.

146
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,003
The what?

147
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:11,968
Sort of a parrot.

148
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:14,287
Taller than Jesus.

149
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:17,324
Brilliant yellow, like a sunflower.

150
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:21,447
It attacked those nuns
like an avenging angel.

151
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,725
The nuns begged for mercy.

152
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,247
But the yellow bird
slaughtered them anyway.

153
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,723
Then the bird folded me in its wings...

154
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,599
...and lifted me up to paradise.

155
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,767
That's one hell of a bird
to have on your side.

156
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,601
Anyway, that's why l have
an aversion to nuns...

157
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:46,566
...and God and religion.

158
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:50,525
Forget it.
Black stockings are a waste of time.

159
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:54,644
No one's gonna remember us
because we're leaving no witnesses.

160
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,124
How about staying at our place tonight?

161
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:33,638
Frozen stiff TV dinners on trays...

162
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,199
...spaghetti, macaroni or pizza.

163
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:39,037
-Sounds irresistible.
-I'll tell Mom.

164
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:42,724
-Golly, Sue. C'est impossible.
-Pourquoi, chérie?

165
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:46,085
-Bobby's coming over.
-I'll pick you up for church tomorrow.

166
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:47,443
9:00 sharp.

167
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,248
A full day's work
deserves a full-course dinner.

168
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:06,479
The condemned ate a hearty meal.

169
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:10,039
I don't know what they ate,
but tonight, cheeseburgers.

170
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:11,608
Tomorrow?

171
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:13,197
Mexico.

172
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:16,881
-Fabulous Mexico.
-Land of the hot ta.ma.Ies.

173
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:19,921
Gold country.

174
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:25,037
Remember Bogart
in Trea.sure of the Sierra. Ma.dre?

175
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,438
We could get us a couple of burros.

176
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:30,878
Some tools.

177
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:33,608
Slow down, honey.
I don't know gold dust from diarrhoea.

178
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:34,963
Well, l do.

179
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,521
My old man prospected for gold in Alaska.

180
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:43,278
He taught me all the ins and outs.

181
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:46,209
Yeah. And we end up nuts.

182
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:50,079
No gold, nothing. Just like in the movie.

183
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,240
You never meant it...

184
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:02,724
...about going to Mexico, did you?
Did you?

185
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:08,448
Sure, baby.

186
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:10,968
Sure we're going.

187
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:15,480
But first we gotta dig up some capital.
Like tonight.

188
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,604
$5,000 a piece, for one hour's work.

189
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:25,199
-May l take your orders?
-Two cheeseburgers, please.

190
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,320
Getting insured is like...

191
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:41,486
...well, when you wash your car,
it always rains.

192
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,409
Know what we call this
in the insurance game?

193
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:45,843
The solemn moment.

194
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:50,399
I guess when a man makes out a policy
or takes out his last will...

195
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,367
...it's only natural to think about mortality.

196
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:58,160
Herb, as of this minute,
your life is worth $40,000.

197
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:01,727
In case of accidental death,
double indemnity.

198
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,958
New York Life wishes you
a very long and very healthy life.

199
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,086
-And so do l.
-And so do l.

200
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:21,363
That waitress.
Nice piece of blonde chicken.

201
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:23,884
Why'd you pick me for this job?

202
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,849
A perfect score needs perfect partners.

203
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:30,045
Together we're a perfect fit.

204
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:33,358
It's your score. Where do l fit in?

205
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:37,599
I got you figured for a natural-born killer.

206
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:41,602
Or did you lie about that punk in Vegas?

207
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:44,563
No.

208
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:46,687
Why did you kill him?

209
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:50,489
No special reason. Just for the hell of it.

210
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:53,085
That's the best reason of all.

211
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:57,682
Back there, you wanted to kill me.

212
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:59,840
Just for a second, right?

213
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:02,763
It passed.

214
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,041
Hair-trigger temper.

215
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,440
Somebody crosses you, voom!

216
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:11,119
Yes, sir. You've got the gift, boy.

217
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,448
Remember the chaplain's clerk, Willie Jay?

218
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:19,441
-The guy you painted to look like Jesus?
-He said the same thing:

219
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:21,925
"Unstable, explosive."

220
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,480
He is a flaming faggot.

221
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:26,686
He has a brilliant mind.

222
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:29,727
Then how come
he got caught stealing five times?

223
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:34,562
-He was the best friend l ever had.
-I'm the only friend you got now.

224
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:38,845
Friend to the end, for better or worse.

225
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,525
Till death do us part?

226
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:45,325
All we need is a ring, sugar.

227
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:08,088
Is that Bobby?

228
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:18,285
Look at that land, will you?

229
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:21,044
Oil money, gas money, wheat money.

230
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:24,080
Share the wealth, baby.

231
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,758
-How does it feel?
-What?

232
00:23:36,689 --> 00:23:38,281
Being a father.

233
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:40,964
Great.

234
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:44,805
-Your kids, you love them?
-I'm their father, ain't l?

235
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:48,006
I didn't ask if you were their father.
I asked if you love them.

236
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:50,247
I'm crazy about 'em.

237
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,889
-But you left them.
-Left their mother.

238
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:57,044
Okay. She left me.

239
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:59,964
There was this piece of tail,
nothing serious.

240
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:02,244
Just a quickie in the back seat.

241
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:05,761
She blew the whistle on me.
Said l knocked her up.

242
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:10,043
That's how l got to be a two-time loser.

243
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,359
You ditched the kids for her.

244
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:16,045
Jesus, baby.
I had to do the right thing by her, didn't l?

245
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:20,360
Well? Didn't l?

246
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:22,642
Yeah.

247
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:36,047
-'Night!
-See you tomorrow, Bobby.

248
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:57,121
-How much longer?
-Seven miles.

249
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:16,446
Fill her up with regular.

250
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:56,882
Want some candy?

251
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,002
No.

252
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,608
You okay?

253
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:05,442
I'm fine.

254
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,718
Coming?

255
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:18,282
Let's go.

256
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:23,637
News from the Associa.ted Press,
NBC, a.nd the Garden City Telegram.

257
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:27,083
-Goodnight, Dad.
-Goodnight, Son.

258
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:30,407
Winds from the south
a.t a.bout 15 miles per hour.

259
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:35,889
The Ga.rden City Sa.Ie Compa.ny reported
3,273 ca.ttle a.t the a.uction yesterda.y.

260
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:37,448
'Night.

261
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:42,205
...ca.Ives went from $26.50 to $30.
However, very few rea.ched the $30 ma.rk.

262
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:45,883
The medium a.nd good kinds
sold a.s high a.s $26.50....

263
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:57,479
Look at that spread.

264
00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:00,243
Don't tell me this guy ain't loaded.

265
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,561
Let's pull out of here.

266
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:19,238
Now, before it's too late.

267
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:18,881
-Pa?
-Maybe they're still asleep.

268
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:24,478
Nancy?

269
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:11,368
Don't touch it.

270
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:14,727
Don't touch anything.

271
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,961
Been up there?

272
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:35,682
My God.

273
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:54,325
There's two more in the basement.

274
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:11,198
I just saw two ambulances
going up to Clutter's.

275
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,280
I was just wondering what's happening.

276
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:36,923
The Sheriffpla.ced a.n urgent ca.Il
to the Ka.nsa.s Burea.u of lnvestiga.tion.

277
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:41,878
In Topeka., Loga.n Sa.nford, KBI chief,
a.ssigned four men to the Clutter ca.se.

278
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:46,438
They a.re a.gents Dewey, Nye,
Duntz, a.nd Church.

279
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:51,605
-What happened to the basketball game?
-It got interrupted. Terrible thing, that.

280
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:55,808
I've never been so hungry in my whole life.

281
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:59,321
Agent Alvin Dewey a.rrived
a.t the Clutter house...

282
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:01,764
...in a.dva.nce of the other KBI men.

283
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,998
Mr. Dewey, resident of Ga.rden City,
wa.s pla.ced in cha.rge of the ca.se.

284
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:12,764
Were all four tied with the same cord?

285
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:15,319
All tied with the same square knot.

286
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:18,122
Used by anybody
who works with livestock.

287
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,882
-Find any shell casings?
-Nope.

288
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:24,161
Which means that...

289
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,128
...you can bet
they didn't leave any fingerprints either.

290
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:32,437
Al.

291
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,958
-This is the housekeeper.
-Thank you for coming.

292
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:37,801
-Are they still--
-No, no, ma'am.

293
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,244
They've been taken to the funeral home.

294
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:43,723
Now, if you'll just look around
with Mr. Church here...

295
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:45,640
...to see if anything is missing....

296
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:48,687
They never hurt anybody. Why them?

297
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:02,607
Al, you knew Clutter.

298
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,761
Did he have a safe?

299
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:09,440
Keep a lot of cash on hand?

300
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:11,521
The old Kansas myth.

301
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:14,489
Every farmer with a good spread
is supposed to have...

302
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:17,322
...a hidden black box somewhere
filled with money.

303
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:21,038
No. Herb paid everything by check.
Even a $2 haircut.

304
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:24,287
Well, then why...

305
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,883
...if they're going
to shoot them all anyway, why...

306
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:30,957
...did they first cut Clutter's throat?

307
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:36,162
Why did they first put him
on a soft mattress box?

308
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:37,841
To make him comfy?

309
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,243
And why the pillow under the boy's head?

310
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:46,006
We keep saying "they."
lt could have been one man.

311
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:50,003
A madman.

312
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:57,243
This picture was taken
with a time exposure.

313
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,804
It shows only what the eye saw.

314
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:03,357
This picture was taken with a flashbulb.

315
00:34:03,449 --> 00:34:05,758
That's a different pair of shoes.

316
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:08,318
Yeah.

317
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,969
We know there were at least two of them.

318
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:16,566
You won't see it there.
The flash made them stand out in the dust.

319
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:19,243
-You develop those pictures yourself?
-Yes.

320
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:21,837
-Newspaper boy's seen this?
-Not yet.

321
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,721
Keep it that way.

322
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,198
Al, when can we see the Clutter home?

323
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:33,280
Why were the men killed in the basement?

324
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,519
I'll talk facts, not theories.

325
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:39,763
It happened around 2:00 a.m.

326
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:44,087
All four were apparently killed
by the same weapon.

327
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:47,639
Shotgun, 1 2-gauge.
Mr. Clutter's throat was cut.

328
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:49,801
Before he was shot?

329
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,362
Probably.

330
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:56,321
All four were tied
with the same nylon sash-cord...

331
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,798
...sold in most hardware stores.

332
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:00,881
And their mouths were taped.

333
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:03,437
How were they tied? What kind of knots?

334
00:35:04,049 --> 00:35:06,005
Can we see police pictures?

335
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:07,886
-Find the murder weapon?
-Not yet.

336
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:11,359
-Any clues or fingerprints?
-Lots. All belong to the family.

337
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:14,646
They say that Nancy's boyfriend
is a prime suspect.

338
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:17,766
-Is that what they say?
-He was the last one to see them alive.

339
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:20,921
-Except the killers.
-Then there were more than one?

340
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:23,842
-Were the women sexually molested?
-The coroner says not.

341
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:25,965
-Why didn't the dog bark?
-He didn't bark?

342
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:29,598
-Nobody heard him.
-Nobody heard the gunshots either.

343
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:33,439
Mr. Dewey, in your opinion...

344
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:36,168
...do you think it could have been
an inside job, sir?

345
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:39,764
-Why didn't Mr. Clutter resist?
-Mr. Dewey, just a moment, Mr. Dewey.

346
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:42,087
What about the hired man?

347
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:45,525
His check was made out for $1,707.

348
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:48,487
Mr. Clutter's first premium
on a straight life policy...

349
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:50,560
...worth $40,000.

350
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:53,802
Double indemnity makes it $80,000.

351
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:57,003
And that makes it a strange coincidence.

352
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:01,719
And that's all it is, a coincidence.

353
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:05,645
I didn't catch your name.

354
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:07,925
Bill Jensen, Weekly magazine.

355
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:11,805
If you're not here to write news,
what is your interest?

356
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:14,728
Fairly basic.

357
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:18,963
What's basic about a stupid...

358
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:21,242
...senseless crime?

359
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:26,447
A violent, unknown force
destroys a decent, ordinary family.

360
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:29,679
No clues. No logic.

361
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:34,121
Makes us all feel frightened. Vulnerable.

362
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:38,406
Murder's no mystery. Only the motive.

363
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,203
Got one?

364
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:44,721
I smoke too much.

365
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,406
How'd they enter the house?
A key? Force a window?

366
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,120
Probably just walked in.

367
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:55,928
-Don't people around here lock doors?
-They will tonight.

368
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:00,639
I know something's wrong here.

369
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:02,797
I feel it.

370
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:05,839
I don't know what it is, but....

371
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:08,523
Mr. Clutter never allowed smoking
in the house.

372
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:10,123
Sorry.

373
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:11,882
Something.

374
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:16,485
But of course.

375
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,121
The radio!

376
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:22,004
Kenyon always listened
to the news and weather...

377
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:23,807
...before he went to bed.

378
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,888
But where's his radio?

379
00:37:26,569 --> 00:37:28,719
Since the night of horror, two da.ys a.go...

380
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:32,837
...few people a.re seen on the streets
of Ga.rden City a.fter da.rk.

381
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,683
To da.te, no clues ha.ve been uncovered.

382
00:37:36,529 --> 00:37:38,326
No clues wha.tever.

383
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:43,927
It wa.s genera.Ily known tha.t Clutter
never ha.d la.rge sums of ca.sh on ha.nd.

384
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,127
No expensivejewels.

385
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:48,883
Nor even a. steel sa.fe in which to--

386
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,923
Perry, baby,
if you don't want that burger....

387
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:59,801
You and your hotshot
prison buddy Floyd Wells.

388
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,880
Big, fat safe in the wall.

389
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:07,166
$10,000. "A cinch."

390
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:11,485
Okay, Floyd's a jerk.
But we scored, didn't we?

391
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:12,963
Perfecto.

392
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:16,479
You call an 800-mile drive...

393
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:19,357
...and the rest of it, for 43...

394
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:21,804
...lousy dollars, you call that perfect?

395
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,358
And that!

396
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,682
You don't believe that con
about no clues do you?

397
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:29,488
You worry too much.

398
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:32,647
How are them cowboys
gonna connect us? Remember?

399
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:34,408
No witnesses.

400
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:37,443
I know one.

401
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,719
You. You're a witness.

402
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:52,725
Jesus, kid. For a minute,
l thought you blew your cork.

403
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:56,803
You're so right.

404
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:00,325
We're the only ones who saw it...

405
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:02,839
...and that, honey, is our big ace.

406
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:07,439
Because if they can't split us apart,
they can't get a confession.

407
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:10,362
And if they can't get a confession,
they got nothing.

408
00:39:11,689 --> 00:39:12,804
Next move...

409
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:16,324
...Mexico.

410
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:19,278
-Once we beat it out of the country.
-On what?

411
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:22,483
$43 and a smile and bullshit?

412
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:27,522
You guessed it, Chief.
It's the smile that does it.

413
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:30,561
Like it says in the commercials:

414
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:33,607
"The family that sticks together
lives forever."

415
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:47,166
Officers investiga.ting the sla.ying
ha.ve a.ppea.Ied to the public...

416
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:49,160
...for help in solving the crime.

417
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:52,958
A Ka.nsa.s pa.per, The Hutchison News,
ha.s offered a. rewa.rd for a.ny informa.tion...

418
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:55,722
...lea.ding to the ca.pture
a.nd conviction of the person...

419
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:58,448
...or persons, guilty of the Clutter murders.

420
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:01,117
A rewa.rd of $1,000.

421
00:40:03,729 --> 00:40:07,517
What about the reward?
That's right, $1,000.

422
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:12,480
Yes, sir. Where are you calling from?

423
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:15,606
Yeah. Go ahead.

424
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,164
Who?

425
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:24,639
How do you know he was a foreigner?

426
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:30,358
-I see. Thank you very much, sir.
-Another tip?

427
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:34,206
He says he saw a foreigner running.

428
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:37,046
How does a foreigner run, anyway?

429
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:39,723
Just how many people
have tried to claim this reward?

430
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:41,527
Just about everybody.

431
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:44,760
A mysterious stranger did it.

432
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,485
Hired killers did it.
A jealous neighbour did it.

433
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:52,406
Seems like the only one
who didn't do it is the butler.

434
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:54,725
Any luck?

435
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:58,482
None of the Clutters had shoes
with a cat's paw.

436
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:02,688
No diamond pattern, either.
Insurance money goes to the family.

437
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:06,249
And this, Nancy Clutter's.

438
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:10,398
Found it hidden in the toe of her slipper.

439
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:12,760
Something must've scared her.

440
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:16,041
All of which brings us back
to the motive of robbery.

441
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:20,839
I can believe one man might work up
enough rage to do it.

442
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:22,119
But two?

443
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:26,881
Who would kill four people in cold blood
for a radio...

444
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:31,158
...a pair of binoculars and $40 in cash?

445
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:35,884
These days? Take your pick
on any crowded street.

446
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:39,762
You ever hang any paper?

447
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:42,602
I couldn't cash a check even if it was good.

448
00:41:57,929 --> 00:42:00,443
Easy, baby. Casual.

449
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:10,247
Excuse me. My name's Hickock.
Richie. And you're?

450
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:11,882
Sharp. Luke Sharp.

451
00:42:12,169 --> 00:42:14,683
I'll bet in school
they called you Look Sharp.

452
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:16,687
See that gentleman over there?

453
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:19,363
Would you believe a runt like that
is getting married?

454
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:24,807
Well, maybe he ain't any Fred Astaire
but he's my best friend...

455
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,201
...and l'm his best man.

456
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:31,245
My wedding present to him
is going to be what you might call...

457
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:32,682
...his trousseau.

458
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:45,048
Ideal shade for an informal ceremony,
don't you think?

459
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,164
Perfectly ideal.

460
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:48,888
Of course,
we are a tiny bit oddly proportioned.

461
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:52,439
I mean, the upper torso is so large
compared to the legs.

462
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:56,327
I'm terribly sorry.

463
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:58,920
He's not ashamed of them scars.

464
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:01,604
They gave him the Bronze Star in Korea.

465
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:06,961
Luke, have you ever been to Eden Roc?
ln Miami Beach.

466
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:10,086
That's where the happy couple
is shacking up for their honeymoon.

467
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:12,888
Two weeks all paid up.
Surprise gift from the folks.

468
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:14,317
He's a very lucky man.

469
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:15,683
He deserves it.

470
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:21,284
And with these, $192.70.

471
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:24,083
Would you like them wrapped
and taken to your car?

472
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:26,558
No hurry.
Deliver them when the suit is ready.

473
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:27,884
Oh, no!

474
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:31,648
Four silly dollars.

475
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:34,408
We're awfully sorry.

476
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:36,798
We'll have to come back some other time.

477
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:40,240
I'd gladly give you a check.

478
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:42,808
But then you hardly know me.

479
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:45,039
We're really grateful for your courtesy.

480
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:47,882
-If it's a personal check, perhaps.
-You're sure?

481
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:50,847
-I wouldn't want to inconvenience you.
-Perfectly all right.

482
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:52,408
Which bank would you like?

483
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:54,400
It's immaterial, l'm sure.

484
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:59,523
My driver's license, identity card,
insurance card, country club....

485
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:02,047
She's a private number.

486
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:05,128
-Was that $192?
-And $0.70.

487
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:07,920
Would you care if l....

488
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:09,840
-Never mind.
-No, please.

489
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:12,520
Well, l could use a little loose change.

490
00:44:12,689 --> 00:44:13,485
I see.

491
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,845
Suppose l just make this out for $280...

492
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:19,001
...and $0.70, of course.

493
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:21,282
Well, l suppose.

494
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:25,403
Mr. Sharp, you're a brick.

495
00:44:30,249 --> 00:44:32,444
You're good. You're really good.

496
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:36,401
Smooth. No sweat. No strain.

497
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,646
-You're an artist, boy.
-Right.

498
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:41,688
If you're getting married,
you need a wedding ring.

499
00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:43,521
-Why not two of them?
-Why not?

500
00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:47,284
Cameras, diamond rings, TV sets
are the easiest things to hock or sell.

501
00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:40,769
You know, there's got to be
something wrong with us...

502
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:42,328
...to do what we did.

503
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:46,199
Nobody, but nobody,
ever gets away with a thing like that.

504
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:47,927
Will you shut up about it?

505
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:52,399
I can't shake this feeling
that we forgot something that night.

506
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:56,680
I don't know what,
something that belongs to us.

507
00:45:57,249 --> 00:46:00,719
You want to go back to that house
and look for whatever the hell it is?

508
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:04,768
Because that would make us
not only crazy, but insane.

509
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:29,725
Any luck?

510
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:32,562
If they didn't leave any fingerprints,
you can be sure...

511
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:34,640
...they didn't leave any murder weapons.

512
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:04,168
People who used to work for Clutter,
going back 15 years.

513
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:06,968
Hired men,
people he used to do business with....

514
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:11,766
-Just keep talking.
-Upstairs?

515
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:14,477
Don't look up.

516
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:17,528
-See something?
-I'm not sure.

517
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:22,643
Now you take the office side
and l'll go around the kitchen side.

518
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,080
It's true, really true.

519
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,882
We're on our way
and never coming back, never.

520
00:48:01,569 --> 00:48:02,888
And no regrets.

521
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:05,199
For you. You are leaving nothing.

522
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:08,962
What about my old man? And my mother.

523
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:12,328
They'll still be there
when my checks start bouncing.

524
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:14,798
It's nice the way
you think about your folks.

525
00:48:15,889 --> 00:48:17,845
I'm a real thoughtful bastard.

526
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:34,078
'Morning, Bess. Coffee?

527
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:37,403
Hey, Alvin,
that prowler at the Clutter house...

528
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:39,525
-...get a confession out of him yet?
-Yep.

529
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:42,681
His confession proved he didn't do it:
Escaped mental patient.

530
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:46,239
If he's the wrong one,
why in hell don't you find the right one?

531
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:50,163
I've got a house full of women
who are afraid to go to the toilet alone.

532
00:48:51,689 --> 00:48:55,477
Bunch of gabby old women gassing away,
scaring each other.

533
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:59,887
Somebody with a grudge done it.
Somebody who hated the Clutters.

534
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:03,041
Nobody asked you.
Nobody hated the Clutters.

535
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:05,605
Leastways, nobody that knew them.

536
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:06,758
Phone.

537
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:13,404
If this can happen to a decent,
God-fearing family...

538
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:14,888
...who's safe anymore?

539
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,638
Hello?

540
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:21,203
-From here?
-No, from Topeka. It's urgent!

541
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:26,768
Okay, Mr. Sandrew.

542
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:29,838
Tell Alvin it's a prisoner. In Lancing.

543
00:49:30,689 --> 00:49:34,967
Get me a rap sheet on this man, please.
He mentioned the Clutter case.

544
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:39,325
He wouldn't say any more
unless he was called out of the cellblock.

545
00:49:39,729 --> 00:49:43,199
I have the warden on the other phone now.
Might be a break.

546
00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:46,920
If it is, l'll be out to Garden City tonight
with the tape.

547
00:49:47,129 --> 00:49:48,687
No, phone's too risky.

548
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:52,563
Hello? Yes.

549
00:49:54,169 --> 00:49:58,606
"KSP 1-4-3-2-3. Floyd Wells."

550
00:50:04,049 --> 00:50:06,517
-I first met him in the penitentia.ry.
-Hickock?

551
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:09,119
Yes, sir. We sha.red the sa.me cell.

552
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:10,803
Go a.hea.d, Floyd.

553
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:15,037
We swa.pped life stories a.nd l told him...

554
00:50:15,129 --> 00:50:17,518
...how l once worked
for a. fa.rmer na.med Clutter.

555
00:50:17,929 --> 00:50:19,408
Did you work for him?

556
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:21,725
Yes, sir. Ten, eleven yea.rs a.go.

557
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:25,479
Dick wa.nted to know if Mr. Clutter
wa.s rich a.nd l sa.id, "Well...

558
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:29,801
"...sometimes it cost him $10,000
a. week to run his opera.tion. "

559
00:50:30,169 --> 00:50:33,445
After tha.t, Dick never let up.
Just kept a.sking questions.

560
00:50:34,169 --> 00:50:36,967
How ma.ny wa.s in the fa.mily?
Did Clutter keep a. sa.fe?

561
00:50:37,049 --> 00:50:39,847
Dick sa.id how he wa.s going
to rob the Clutter pla.ce...

562
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:41,203
...him a.nd his buddy.

563
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,678
And how he wa.s gonna. kill
a.Il the witnesses.

564
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:46,483
Ijust never believed him.
I thought it wa.sjust--

565
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:48,885
What took him so long to speak up?

566
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:52,519
Afraid of other prisoners.
Issue a pickup warrant.

567
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:54,607
All points bulletin.

568
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:57,840
We better make it for parole violation,
passing bad checks.

569
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:00,119
If they know they're wanted for murder....

570
00:51:00,209 --> 00:51:03,201
-Yeah.
-The question is why they did it.

571
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:07,083
Why did Cain kill Abel? And who cares?

572
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:10,199
They did it, and they'll swing for it.

573
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:15,601
If they did it and if we can prove it.

574
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:20,758
When we cross this bridge,
we're in Mexico.

575
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:22,567
Free, clear and safe.

576
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,678
Fabulous Mexico.

577
00:51:45,729 --> 00:51:46,798
Mr. Smith?

578
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:50,002
Mr. Tex Smith?

579
00:51:50,169 --> 00:51:52,842
-Cops?
-Kansas Bureau of lnvestigation.

580
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:00,329
Is this your son, Perry?

581
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:10,247
Yep, that's him all right.

582
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:13,480
Gets his looks from his mother.

583
00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:15,642
Part Cherokee.

584
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:19,081
-Will you have some coffee?
-When did you see him last?

585
00:52:19,609 --> 00:52:22,123
-Couple of years ago.
-In prison?

586
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:26,326
I was just fixing to make some grub.
You want some eats?

587
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:30,483
He was in for three and a half years.
He's been out on parole for six months.

588
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:33,601
Well, then l guess l haven't seen him
for five or six years.

589
00:52:33,689 --> 00:52:36,487
That's not surprising though.
He's a lone wolf just like me.

590
00:52:36,569 --> 00:52:38,400
You can rest easy on one thing sure...

591
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,798
...you won't be having
any more trouble with Perry.

592
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:42,641
He's learned his lesson for sure.

593
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:45,289
When he wrote me from prison,
l wrote him back pronto.

594
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:47,325
"Boy, you take your punishment
with a smile.

595
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:50,082
"l didn't raise you to steal,
so don't expect me to cry...

596
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:52,364
"...because you got it tough
behind the bars."

597
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:54,883
Perry's no fool. He knows when he's beat.

598
00:52:55,489 --> 00:52:58,561
You fellows have got him whipped forever.
The law's the boss.

599
00:52:58,649 --> 00:53:01,004
He knows the difference
between right and wrong.

600
00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:03,762
I taught my kids a golden rule:
Always tell the truth...

601
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,317
...wash in the morning,
be sober and independent.

602
00:53:06,409 --> 00:53:07,728
I showed him how.

603
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:11,205
How to prospect, how to trap fur,
how to carpenter, how to bake bread...

604
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:12,881
...how to be his own boss.

605
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:16,808
Yes, he's a chip off the old block, all right.

606
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:21,680
I never had no trouble with my kids,
not as long as Flo and me was together.

607
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:24,726
But she wanted the wild life.

608
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:28,446
So she took the kids and ran off.
Turned them against me.

609
00:53:28,529 --> 00:53:29,723
All but Perry.

610
00:53:30,769 --> 00:53:32,407
I don't know what got into her.

611
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:35,083
She started drinking.
Turned into a hopeless drunk.

612
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:38,559
Started stepping out with young men.
I caught her once and l....

613
00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:43,601
Anyway, she died drunk.

614
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:46,400
Choked to death on her own vomit.

615
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:50,564
So l took Perry and we started roaming
to forget it all.

616
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:56,280
I took him with me everywhere.

617
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:04,406
How that boy loved me.

618
00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:11,085
At night, when it was cold...

619
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:15,561
...we'd sleep cuddled up.

620
00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:22,441
He'd hang onto me with his little arms,
so tight.

621
00:54:27,249 --> 00:54:31,128
I'd tell him stories about
the great adventures we was gonna have.

622
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:38,367
How we was gonna strike it rich.

623
00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:43,327
Buried treasures.

624
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:47,844
Gold.

625
00:54:50,169 --> 00:54:51,443
In Alaska.

626
00:54:57,849 --> 00:55:01,285
That's where this picture was took.
Him and me in Alaska.

627
00:55:05,689 --> 00:55:08,522
You just ask Perry if l wasn't
a good father to him.

628
00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:12,000
I always shared, always.
When l eat, he eats.

629
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:17,044
You just tell Perry,
when l die all my insurance goes to him.

630
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:23,963
Yes, sir.

631
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:27,481
His life is all set.

632
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:32,848
Great news!

633
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:36,123
I met this kid. He's a shoeshine boy.

634
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:41,202
He's got a cousin in Yucatan, a fisherman.

635
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:44,129
-And he's got a powerboat.
-So?

636
00:55:44,929 --> 00:55:48,922
So, we drive to Yucatan, we sell the car...

637
00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:51,849
...buy us a load of deep-sea diving gear...

638
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:55,683
...and "pow," we hit the Cortés jackpot.

639
00:55:56,689 --> 00:56:00,045
$60 million in Spanish gold.

640
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:05,922
Of course, we'll have to cut the kid in,
and his cousin, too.

641
00:56:08,209 --> 00:56:12,407
But even so, Yucatan!

642
00:56:13,449 --> 00:56:16,282
Hot, dry, clean...

643
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:19,637
...no crowd, no noise.

644
00:56:21,049 --> 00:56:22,960
Doing what we came to do.

645
00:56:23,609 --> 00:56:26,726
-How much can we get for the car?
-$1 20.

646
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:27,924
Is that all?

647
00:56:28,729 --> 00:56:32,244
Enough to pay the bills.
Hotel, bar, groceries.

648
00:56:32,529 --> 00:56:36,158
And with what's left over,
l bought us two bus tickets...

649
00:56:36,249 --> 00:56:40,401
...as far as Barstow, California.
After that, we walk.

650
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:43,682
So get rid of that ton and a half of garbage.

651
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:46,966
Ship it! Dump it! Burn it! l don't care.

652
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:50,765
Only get rid of it, by tonight.
'Cause come tomorrow, we're gone.

653
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:54,122
-Back to the States.
-Now listen.

654
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,848
You listen! l've had it!

655
00:56:55,929 --> 00:56:58,807
You, your maps, fishing boats,
buried treasure, all of it!

656
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:00,880
Everything! Stop jacking off.

657
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:03,767
There isn't any caskets of gold.
No buried treasure.

658
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:08,282
And even if there was, hell, boy,
you can't even swim.

659
00:57:10,529 --> 00:57:13,043
You want to stick with me, okay.

660
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:16,882
You wanna split, that's okay, too.

661
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:20,000
Only make up your mind.

662
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:26,042
-I'll ship our stuff back to Vegas.
-Good.

663
00:57:27,769 --> 00:57:30,283
I got a little senorita. coming over tonight.

664
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:34,087
I'll try to be finished packing
before you get back.

665
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,877
What for? Hell, l'm not bashful, baby.

666
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:40,289
And that, if we find the motive,
we find the killer.

667
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:44,441
And that, if we find the motive,
we find the killer.

668
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:46,038
If.

669
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:51,088
This report was written six months...

670
00:57:51,169 --> 00:57:53,729
...before the Clutters were killed.

671
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:57,600
It's called,
Murder Without Appa.rent Motive.

672
00:57:58,489 --> 00:58:00,878
At the Menninger Clinic,
right here in Kansas...

673
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:03,403
...a study was made of four killers.

674
00:58:04,249 --> 00:58:06,444
They all had certain things in common.

675
00:58:06,689 --> 00:58:09,203
They all committed senseless murders.

676
00:58:09,729 --> 00:58:13,961
They all felt physically inferior
and sexually inadequate.

677
00:58:15,129 --> 00:58:18,883
Their childhood was violent,
or one parent was missing.

678
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:21,719
Or someone else had raised them.

679
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:26,803
They couldn't distinguish
between fantasy and reality.

680
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:31,127
They didn't hate their victims,
they didn't even know them.

681
00:58:31,209 --> 00:58:34,997
They felt no guilt about their crime,
and got nothing out of it.

682
00:58:35,769 --> 00:58:40,001
And most important,
they told the police or a psychiatrist...

683
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:45,799
...that they felt the urge to kill,
before they committed murder.

684
00:58:46,729 --> 00:58:48,959
Their warnings were disregarded.

685
00:58:55,169 --> 00:58:58,127
So, who killed the Clutters?

686
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:06,885
Someday, somebody will explain
to me the motive of a newspaper.

687
00:59:07,689 --> 00:59:10,203
First you scream, "Find the bastards."

688
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:13,083
Till we find them you want to get us fired.

689
00:59:13,169 --> 00:59:15,922
When we find them,
you accuse us of brutality.

690
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:20,719
Before we can go into court,
you give them a trial by newspaper.

691
00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:24,521
When we finally get a conviction
you want to save them...

692
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:27,282
...by proving they were crazy
in the first place.

693
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:31,403
All of which adds up to one thing:
You've got the killers.

694
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:35,404
Off the record, have you got them?

695
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:38,563
Suspects.

696
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:41,119
Even if we catch them, that's all we've got.

697
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:47,279
Because without a confession, the evidence
we got so far, we couldn't go to trial.

698
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:51,766
Unless we can place the suspects
in this spot...

699
00:59:52,609 --> 00:59:56,045
...unless we can tie the killers
to that piece of rope...

700
00:59:56,449 --> 00:59:57,848
...they'll never hang.

701
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:25,640
Perry!

702
01:03:52,729 --> 01:03:54,287
Was it good, baby?

703
01:03:55,609 --> 01:03:56,564
Was it good?

704
01:03:58,169 --> 01:04:00,080
Baby, was it really good?

705
01:04:32,649 --> 01:04:35,004
All a truck gets us, is from here to there.

706
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:37,207
We want a score.

707
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:41,561
One guy with a fat wallet,
in a fast car, with a back seat.

708
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:43,687
I sit beside him.

709
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:46,364
You get in the back, l feed him a few jokes.

710
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:50,008
I say, "Hey, Perry, pass me a match."

711
01:04:50,649 --> 01:04:51,764
That's your signal.

712
01:04:51,849 --> 01:04:54,283
Fast. Hard. Snap. I grab the wheel.

713
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:57,881
You're so good at it,
you sit in the back seat.

714
01:04:58,169 --> 01:04:59,443
You do it.

715
01:05:03,489 --> 01:05:05,161
Look friendly, now.

716
01:05:20,689 --> 01:05:22,486
You're a lucky bastard.

717
01:05:32,769 --> 01:05:35,488
Don't forget,
when l say, "Pass me a match."

718
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:38,367
-Hop in boys. Where are you going?
-Come on. Get in.

719
01:05:39,129 --> 01:05:40,528
Not with you.

720
01:05:43,209 --> 01:05:44,881
Thanks just the same.

721
01:05:45,249 --> 01:05:46,682
Did you see them guys?

722
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:48,999
Jesus! They could've robbed us.

723
01:05:49,689 --> 01:05:50,838
What of?

724
01:06:01,889 --> 01:06:05,120
I'm really not supposed to pick up anybody
in the company car, but--

725
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:08,679
-What the hell, you only live once.
-That's what they say.

726
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:11,082
Comfortable back there?

727
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:13,645
I can take you as far as lowa.

728
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:16,962
Where have you boys been?

729
01:06:17,049 --> 01:06:19,244
Mexico. No future there.

730
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:21,561
That depends, my boy.

731
01:06:22,129 --> 01:06:24,006
I honeymooned in Mexico.

732
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:28,608
You might say that's where l planted
the seed of our first child.

733
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:32,799
I ploughed and planted
a few senorita.s there myself.

734
01:06:37,169 --> 01:06:40,400
You know what they call a prostitute
who went to college?

735
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:41,484
What?

736
01:06:42,569 --> 01:06:44,400
A whore-to-culture.

737
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:48,846
I got a riddle for you.

738
01:06:48,929 --> 01:06:50,203
-Ready?
-Shoot.

739
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:55,599
Why is a trip to the bathroom
exactly like a trip to the cemetery?

740
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:59,805
Let me see. A trip to the bathroom...

741
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:03,162
...like a trip to the cemetery....

742
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:06,083
Give up?

743
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,567
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

744
01:07:10,089 --> 01:07:12,125
Perry, pass me a match.

745
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:24,198
Sorry, l never turn down a soldier.

746
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:26,405
This might get the boy home
for Christmas.

747
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:27,638
Lucky break.

748
01:07:28,089 --> 01:07:30,159
Practically a goddamn miracle.

749
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:36,317
You didn't happen to see a portable radio,
Mr. Hickock, about so big?

750
01:07:37,209 --> 01:07:38,403
A Zenith?

751
01:07:39,649 --> 01:07:41,560
Now what makes him do it?

752
01:07:42,489 --> 01:07:44,286
Hit out against people?

753
01:07:45,049 --> 01:07:50,487
Outstanding athlete in basketball, baseball,
football, always made the first team.

754
01:07:50,809 --> 01:07:55,280
He always played to win,
played hard, but clean.

755
01:07:58,649 --> 01:08:02,164
When he left without a word
l knew he was in trouble again.

756
01:08:02,529 --> 01:08:06,568
Now, Mr. Nye, l thought if l....
About breaking parole.

757
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:08,765
Will he have to go back to prison?

758
01:08:14,169 --> 01:08:16,478
You do much hunting, Mr. Hickock?

759
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:19,607
That's his gun. Dick's.

760
01:08:24,249 --> 01:08:26,763
When he come outta prison...

761
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:30,485
...you know, folks was saying
how he'd turned mean.

762
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:34,964
Now how'd they know?
How'd anybody know...

763
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:37,844
...what's inside another person?

764
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:44,524
I haven't got long to go, Mr. Nye.
I'm with cancer.

765
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:47,526
Dick knowed that.

766
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:52,042
Well, before he left, he said to me:

767
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:57,006
"Pa, l'm not ever gonna do anything
to hurt you."

768
01:08:57,449 --> 01:08:59,167
And he meant it, too.

769
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:03,603
If you'd seen him,
you know, playing with his children.

770
01:09:05,089 --> 01:09:09,287
Any boy that loves and respects his folks,
well, you know...

771
01:09:10,009 --> 01:09:12,239
...there's good inside that boy.

772
01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:17,398
I hope you find him, Mr. Nye,
for his own sake. Before it's too late.

773
01:09:50,249 --> 01:09:51,967
You know what we are?

774
01:09:53,249 --> 01:09:56,605
We're the living proof that crime pays.

775
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:06,161
Gifts in a manger.

776
01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:10,486
No more money troubles.

777
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:12,482
Merry Christmas.

778
01:10:13,369 --> 01:10:15,599
Kansas City, here we come.

779
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:17,968
You're crazy.

780
01:10:19,289 --> 01:10:20,688
I gotta get us some money.

781
01:10:20,769 --> 01:10:23,806
How far do you think we could get
in a hot car? With hot checks?

782
01:10:24,209 --> 01:10:26,439
That's right. I'll go by myself.

783
01:10:27,449 --> 01:10:30,088
-Like hell you will.
-I'll meet you later.

784
01:10:31,489 --> 01:10:33,047
We stick together.

785
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:35,518
First we go to Vegas.
We pick up our clothes.

786
01:10:35,609 --> 01:10:37,964
All the stuff l shipped from Mexico.
And then...

787
01:10:38,049 --> 01:10:42,088
...we drive to the nearest port and ship out
on the first tanker leaving this country.

788
01:10:42,169 --> 01:10:44,319
And this time we stay out.

789
01:10:44,409 --> 01:10:45,524
I won't go.

790
01:10:45,929 --> 01:10:47,203
You'll go.

791
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:49,007
What if l don't?

792
01:10:51,049 --> 01:10:53,847
Well, then, "honey, baby"...

793
01:10:55,609 --> 01:10:58,169
...l guess l'll just have to kill you.

794
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:01,761
Yeah. But right now...

795
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:05,277
...we pass a lot of fast, hot checks.

796
01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:22,845
One more check.
We can be in and out of here in an hour.

797
01:11:23,569 --> 01:11:24,718
A cinch.

798
01:11:25,689 --> 01:11:27,441
Stop worrying, will you?

799
01:11:28,809 --> 01:11:30,720
Al, our friends are here.

800
01:11:31,769 --> 01:11:32,804
How do you know?

801
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:36,006
They stole a. ca.r in lowa. a.nd bought
two tires with a. ba.d check.

802
01:11:36,089 --> 01:11:36,760
Where?

803
01:11:36,849 --> 01:11:40,478
Right here. The salesman got worried
and wrote down the license.

804
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,481
The Hickock farm, is it covered?

805
01:11:43,129 --> 01:11:45,359
If they go there, we're covered.

806
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:27,485
I'll be at the Hickock farm.

807
01:12:43,889 --> 01:12:44,878
Yes?

808
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:45,958
Yes.

809
01:12:51,649 --> 01:12:53,446
Did they slip through?

810
01:12:56,809 --> 01:13:00,199
If it wasn't to see his folks,
why would they come back to Kansas?

811
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:04,479
Maybe they're trying to be caught.

812
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:08,163
I guess they'll just have to try harder.

813
01:13:29,769 --> 01:13:31,839
You're not stopping for them?

814
01:13:35,849 --> 01:13:38,317
Look at that old man, he looks awful.

815
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:41,766
Suppose he dies on us?
That means cops, questions.

816
01:13:41,849 --> 01:13:43,202
Think, will you?

817
01:13:43,369 --> 01:13:45,803
I think you're a bastard.

818
01:13:51,209 --> 01:13:52,847
We sure appreciate this, mister.

819
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,078
Get in.

820
01:13:54,689 --> 01:13:55,724
Where you headed?

821
01:13:55,929 --> 01:13:59,842
California. Gramps has got a sister
in Needles. He's going to stay with her.

822
01:14:00,249 --> 01:14:01,648
Did you hear that, Johnny?

823
01:14:02,369 --> 01:14:03,927
Hear me, Johnny?

824
01:14:04,009 --> 01:14:05,601
You got any money?

825
01:14:06,249 --> 01:14:08,046
-Hey, kid.
-No, sir.

826
01:14:09,169 --> 01:14:11,125
Not even $1 for gas?

827
01:14:13,489 --> 01:14:14,808
Only these.

828
01:14:23,569 --> 01:14:26,083
-They're worth $0.03 a bottle.
-So?

829
01:14:27,369 --> 01:14:32,159
If you was to drive real slow,
we could pick us up some real change.

830
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:36,006
That's what Johnny and me
have been eating off of. Refund money.

831
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:39,758
Get in.

832
01:14:43,209 --> 01:14:44,881
We finally found it.

833
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:48,805
The sunken treasure of Captain Cortés.

834
01:14:52,289 --> 01:14:54,007
$0.03 a bottle.

835
01:15:52,809 --> 01:15:54,003
Pay dirt!

836
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:59,158
The Trea.sure of the Sierra. Ma.dre.

837
01:16:16,609 --> 01:16:21,205
Mister, $1 2.60. Fifty-fifty okay?

838
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:23,280
Kid, you're a positive genius.

839
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:24,802
-Happy New Year!
-Likewise.

840
01:16:24,889 --> 01:16:26,766
Keep digging, old-timer.

841
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:48,764
Never seen so much blonde chicken.

842
01:16:49,369 --> 01:16:51,599
And all that sweet divorce money.

843
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:04,208
Hey, Chief...

844
01:17:04,289 --> 01:17:06,200
...you a lucky crap shooter?

845
01:17:06,929 --> 01:17:08,840
Deuces, treys, and twelves.

846
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:10,885
Mr. Snake Eyes himself.

847
01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:13,725
If we put this fiver on the line...

848
01:17:13,809 --> 01:17:15,606
...and if we let it ride.

849
01:17:15,929 --> 01:17:17,920
If we make only 10 passes...

850
01:17:18,889 --> 01:17:21,198
...we'd have over $5,000.

851
01:17:21,889 --> 01:17:24,801
How about it, honey?
l feel real lucky tonight.

852
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,687
You've got visitors.

853
01:18:09,369 --> 01:18:10,324
Hello.

854
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:14,482
Hey, buddy.
Put in a call for that big old yellow bird.

855
01:18:39,009 --> 01:18:40,920
Good afternoon.

856
01:18:41,289 --> 01:18:43,041
-Smith.
-Hickock.

857
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:05,717
Comedian.

858
01:19:17,409 --> 01:19:19,206
Are they still virgins?

859
01:19:19,849 --> 01:19:22,966
-What'd you charge them with?
-Driving a hot car.

860
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:29,884
Officer.

861
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:40,521
-You know why we're here, Mr. Hickock?
-Sir...

862
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:42,242
...you can call me Dick.

863
01:19:43,009 --> 01:19:44,522
All right, Dick.

864
01:19:44,809 --> 01:19:47,277
We understand you've signed
the extradition papers.

865
01:19:47,369 --> 01:19:49,041
Well, what the hell.

866
01:19:49,369 --> 01:19:52,645
There's no denying we broke parole
and hung a mile and half of paper.

867
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,405
Oh, yeah, the car...

868
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:57,602
...it's stolen.

869
01:19:58,049 --> 01:19:59,767
That's it. All of it.

870
01:20:00,169 --> 01:20:01,682
-Okay if l smoke?
-Sure.

871
01:20:04,089 --> 01:20:05,841
In a way, l'm glad it's over.

872
01:20:05,929 --> 01:20:09,239
I'll take what l've got coming.
Serve my time and never...

873
01:20:09,809 --> 01:20:11,447
...but never again.

874
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:22,204
Your parole has a special provision
never to return to Kansas.

875
01:20:22,289 --> 01:20:23,802
I cried my eyes out.

876
01:20:24,169 --> 01:20:27,286
Must've been something important
to bring you back.

877
01:20:29,569 --> 01:20:32,003
I had to see my sister in Fort Scott.

878
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:36,045
-To get money she was holding for me.
-Did you get it?

879
01:20:38,729 --> 01:20:41,118
-She moved away.
-Where?

880
01:20:42,449 --> 01:20:43,768
I don't know.

881
01:20:43,889 --> 01:20:46,722
How far is it
from Kansas City to Fort Scott?

882
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:50,839
I don't know.

883
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:54,001
How long did it take you to drive there,
one hour? Two?

884
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:56,081
Three? Four?

885
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:57,558
I can't remember.

886
01:20:58,649 --> 01:21:00,321
Do you remember what day it was?

887
01:21:00,529 --> 01:21:01,484
Saturday.

888
01:21:01,569 --> 01:21:03,639
Yeah, l remember now.

889
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:06,004
We got to Fort Scott about 4:00 p.m.

890
01:21:06,249 --> 01:21:08,763
-We went right to the post office.
-Why?

891
01:21:08,929 --> 01:21:09,884
Why?

892
01:21:10,209 --> 01:21:12,677
To find out where Perry's sister lived.

893
01:21:12,769 --> 01:21:14,839
The guy at the post office said she moved.

894
01:21:14,929 --> 01:21:17,045
Left no address and left no money, either.

895
01:21:17,129 --> 01:21:19,563
-Must've been quite a blow.
-It was a haymaker.

896
01:21:21,049 --> 01:21:22,767
What did you do then?

897
01:21:23,209 --> 01:21:25,962
Drove back to K.C., went prowling.

898
01:21:26,409 --> 01:21:27,637
Any luck?

899
01:21:28,449 --> 01:21:30,917
Not much.
We ended up with a couple of hustlers.

900
01:21:31,009 --> 01:21:31,839
Named?

901
01:21:32,329 --> 01:21:33,603
I never asked.

902
01:21:37,729 --> 01:21:41,404
You spent the night with these women
and you didn't ask their names?

903
01:21:41,849 --> 01:21:43,407
They were just prostitutes.

904
01:21:43,489 --> 01:21:45,286
Where'd you take them?

905
01:21:47,049 --> 01:21:50,325
I don't remember junk like that.
You'll have to ask Dick.

906
01:21:52,049 --> 01:21:54,165
What did these girls look like?

907
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,042
Describe them.

908
01:21:56,569 --> 01:21:58,525
Blonde? Dark? Big? Little?

909
01:21:58,729 --> 01:22:00,003
Any scars?

910
01:22:00,809 --> 01:22:03,004
Moles? Marks?

911
01:22:05,329 --> 01:22:07,285
Would you like the sordid details?

912
01:22:07,409 --> 01:22:08,637
Anything.

913
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:13,404
Is that how you get your kicks?

914
01:22:14,089 --> 01:22:16,364
She had to be a contortionist.

915
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:19,843
I guess you know why we're really here?

916
01:22:20,489 --> 01:22:24,402
You know we wouldn't have come this far
just to arrest two-bit check chiselers.

917
01:22:24,489 --> 01:22:25,922
Would we, Dick?

918
01:22:26,089 --> 01:22:28,649
-I wasn't listening.
-Are you listening now?

919
01:22:28,809 --> 01:22:31,369
Did you ever hear
of the Clutter murder case?

920
01:22:32,249 --> 01:22:34,479
Can't nobody pin any murder on me.
No, sir.

921
01:22:34,569 --> 01:22:38,847
-The question was: Did you hear about it?
-Read something about it, maybe.

922
01:22:39,049 --> 01:22:40,607
You made three mistakes.

923
01:22:40,729 --> 01:22:42,924
Number one: You left a witness.

924
01:22:43,289 --> 01:22:46,008
A living witness, who'll testify in court.

925
01:22:46,089 --> 01:22:48,239
There ain't any living witness. Can't be.

926
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:50,240
Nobody can pin any murder on me.

927
01:22:50,449 --> 01:22:52,758
Saturday, November 14,
you drove to Fort Scott.

928
01:22:52,849 --> 01:22:55,921
You went to the post office
to get the address of Perry's sister.

929
01:22:56,009 --> 01:22:56,919
That's right.

930
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:07,039
Perry Smith has no sister in Fort Scott.
Never has had.

931
01:23:07,889 --> 01:23:12,519
On Saturday afternoon the post office
in Fort Scott is always closed.

932
01:23:12,969 --> 01:23:16,041
That is your second mistake.

933
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:20,485
Perry seems confused about that night.

934
01:23:20,569 --> 01:23:22,878
I think it's about time
we straightened him out.

935
01:23:23,049 --> 01:23:25,244
Yes, sir. About time.

936
01:23:25,729 --> 01:23:27,242
Look at me, boy.

937
01:23:30,889 --> 01:23:35,041
On Saturday night, November 14,
you were in Holcomb, Kansas.

938
01:23:36,609 --> 01:23:39,043
You were killing the Clutter family.

939
01:23:40,489 --> 01:23:41,558
Never.

940
01:23:42,529 --> 01:23:44,281
-I never--
-Never what?

941
01:23:45,489 --> 01:23:48,162
I never knew anybody by that name...

942
01:23:48,929 --> 01:23:51,727
-...Clutter.
-We've got a living witness.

943
01:24:03,089 --> 01:24:04,647
Well, Perry?

944
01:24:06,929 --> 01:24:08,806
Do you have any aspirin?

945
01:24:09,449 --> 01:24:10,928
They took my aspirin away.

946
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:12,402
Feeling bad?

947
01:24:14,289 --> 01:24:15,608
My legs do.

948
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:23,557
By the way, you know what tomorrow is?

949
01:24:24,689 --> 01:24:26,600
Nancy Clutter's birthday.

950
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:28,482
She would have been 17.

951
01:24:32,969 --> 01:24:34,960
You guys have gotta be stalling.

952
01:24:35,369 --> 01:24:38,725
If you had any real proof....
Real proof, as in eyewitness.

953
01:24:39,369 --> 01:24:40,802
Fingerprints.

954
01:24:45,089 --> 01:24:48,001
As God is my witness,
may l burn in hell forever...

955
01:24:48,089 --> 01:24:49,568
...if l ever killed anybody.

956
01:24:49,649 --> 01:24:51,048
Careful, boy.

957
01:24:55,889 --> 01:24:57,368
Got an aspirin?

958
01:25:01,409 --> 01:25:02,888
How's it going?

959
01:25:03,209 --> 01:25:05,200
Three hours and all we've got so far is:

960
01:25:05,289 --> 01:25:07,723
"No. I don't remember. Ask Dick."

961
01:25:08,489 --> 01:25:12,528
We've caught that hard-nosed little punk
in 50 lies and he still admits nothing.

962
01:25:20,529 --> 01:25:23,168
I think our boy's about primed and ready.

963
01:25:24,009 --> 01:25:25,681
I hope you're right.

964
01:25:33,089 --> 01:25:35,398
Why do all you people get tattooed?

965
01:25:37,849 --> 01:25:39,077
"All you people"?

966
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:43,800
-What people?
-Convicts. You're all tattooed.

967
01:25:44,329 --> 01:25:48,004
That tiger head. What does it do?
Make you feel tough?

968
01:25:52,489 --> 01:25:56,801
That cop's badge, what does it do?
Make you feel honest?

969
01:25:57,769 --> 01:25:59,487
Everybody's got a tattoo.

970
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:01,605
Only you people call them clubs.

971
01:26:01,849 --> 01:26:06,479
Elks, Masons, Boy Scouts. Salute.
High sign. Low sign.

972
01:26:06,689 --> 01:26:10,204
Secret this and secret that.
"No trespassing. Keep off the grass."

973
01:26:10,489 --> 01:26:12,798
Nice, respectable, tattoo clubs.

974
01:26:13,289 --> 01:26:16,964
Poker clubs, golf clubs, tennis clubs.

975
01:26:17,049 --> 01:26:19,722
Clubs for gambling and clubs for drinking.

976
01:26:20,249 --> 01:26:23,207
Even a real club like Daddy-O's got
in that little brown bag.

977
01:26:23,289 --> 01:26:26,247
What you gonna do, pappy?
Club it out of me?

978
01:26:27,369 --> 01:26:28,882
Something like that.

979
01:26:28,969 --> 01:26:31,199
I said you made three mistakes.

980
01:26:31,649 --> 01:26:33,879
First, you left a living witness.

981
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:36,564
Second, your alibi won't hold water.

982
01:26:36,649 --> 01:26:37,923
And third?

983
01:26:38,769 --> 01:26:40,043
Coming up.

984
01:26:42,329 --> 01:26:43,648
Footprints.

985
01:26:45,489 --> 01:26:48,481
Made in the spot
where Mr. Clutter was murdered.

986
01:26:50,569 --> 01:26:52,958
These are the shoes that made them.

987
01:26:55,409 --> 01:26:56,524
Yours.

988
01:26:59,569 --> 01:27:00,797
This footprint...

989
01:27:02,409 --> 01:27:04,559
...was made in Mr. Clutter's blood.

990
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:07,208
Perry's shoe.

991
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:11,205
Same cat's paw. Same size. Same blood.

992
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:21,598
All right, Dick. This time the truth.

993
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:29,328
I don't want to be charged
with murder one...

994
01:27:30,249 --> 01:27:32,285
...because l never pulled the trigger.

995
01:27:32,889 --> 01:27:35,881
I don't even know
what the goddamn hell was happening.

996
01:27:37,129 --> 01:27:39,597
It was Perry. He did it.

997
01:27:42,089 --> 01:27:43,761
I couldn't stop him.

998
01:27:45,929 --> 01:27:47,601
He killed them all.

999
01:28:09,129 --> 01:28:11,165
Are you the officer that made the arrest?

1000
01:28:11,249 --> 01:28:13,399
If you'd grabbed them
five minutes earlier...

1001
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:15,878
...before they'd picked up that box....

1002
01:28:16,089 --> 01:28:17,807
Just luck, l guess.

1003
01:28:18,049 --> 01:28:19,004
Or something.

1004
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:35,884
Hickock swears that he tried to stop you.

1005
01:28:35,969 --> 01:28:40,326
-He was scared that you'd shoot him, too.
-He said you did it. All of it.

1006
01:28:41,609 --> 01:28:44,646
Sure. Now you'd like me to say he did it.

1007
01:28:45,649 --> 01:28:47,879
He's no killer, and he knows it.

1008
01:28:48,449 --> 01:28:51,327
That's why he picked you.
He needed a trigger.

1009
01:28:51,489 --> 01:28:55,198
You had nothing to lose.
You'd already killed a man, in Vegas.

1010
01:28:56,369 --> 01:28:58,963
Beat him to death with a bicycle chain.

1011
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:11,325
Tough boy. Real brass boy.

1012
01:29:13,609 --> 01:29:15,520
I knew if we got caught...

1013
01:29:16,129 --> 01:29:19,804
...if he dropped his guts,
he'd tell about that guy in Vegas.

1014
01:29:21,769 --> 01:29:23,600
I never killed anybody.

1015
01:29:25,729 --> 01:29:27,526
Not before that night.

1016
01:29:30,009 --> 01:29:31,681
'Cause that night...

1017
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:41,482
...l think....

1018
01:29:45,169 --> 01:29:47,842
No, l wa.nt to remember it the wa.y it wa.s.

1019
01:29:51,409 --> 01:29:54,560
We got there a.round midnight.

1020
01:29:56,689 --> 01:29:58,008
This is it.

1021
01:30:02,289 --> 01:30:04,166
Let's pull outta here.

1022
01:30:04,249 --> 01:30:07,047
Now, before it's too late.

1023
01:30:14,649 --> 01:30:18,039
If you're gonna do it,
you'll have to do it alone.

1024
01:30:20,449 --> 01:30:22,758
You don't think l got the guts
to do it alone.

1025
01:30:23,489 --> 01:30:26,686
Okay. I'll show you
who's wearing the pants.

1026
01:30:28,889 --> 01:30:32,484
How'd you kill that guy in Vegas, anyhow?
Love him to death?

1027
01:30:34,329 --> 01:30:36,320
Korean War hero.

1028
01:30:36,809 --> 01:30:38,527
Christ!

1029
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:52,440
Why'd l go a.Iong with it?

1030
01:30:53,289 --> 01:30:55,086
When it first bega.n....

1031
01:30:57,289 --> 01:30:59,803
Who knows when a.nything rea.Ily begins?

1032
01:31:00,969 --> 01:31:04,439
When Dick first told me the pla.n
it didn't even seem rea.I.

1033
01:31:05,569 --> 01:31:08,925
Then, the closer we got,
the more rea.I it beca.me.

1034
01:31:10,249 --> 01:31:14,959
Like the cra.zy stunt ha.d a. Iife of its own
a.nd nothing could stop it.

1035
01:31:16,489 --> 01:31:18,480
Like l wa.s rea.ding a. story...

1036
01:31:18,569 --> 01:31:20,958
...a.nd l ha.d to know
wha.t wa.s gonna. ha.ppen.

1037
01:31:21,449 --> 01:31:22,882
How it would end.

1038
01:32:01,169 --> 01:32:02,238
Wait.

1039
01:32:10,569 --> 01:32:13,163
If we find the safe,
do you know how to open it?

1040
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:16,445
I know somebody that knows.

1041
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:43,325
Honey? ls that you, honey?

1042
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:45,123
Who is it?

1043
01:32:45,649 --> 01:32:47,480
-Come with us. Now!
-What?

1044
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:48,479
Come with us.

1045
01:32:58,289 --> 01:32:59,722
In the office.

1046
01:33:10,409 --> 01:33:11,364
Now, sir.

1047
01:33:12,209 --> 01:33:13,927
Where do you keep that safe?

1048
01:33:14,409 --> 01:33:17,446
What safe? l don't have any safe.

1049
01:33:18,249 --> 01:33:20,638
Don't lie to me, you son of a bitch.

1050
01:33:21,089 --> 01:33:25,128
I know you got a safe.
Right here. In this office.

1051
01:33:25,929 --> 01:33:28,318
I'm sorry, but there isn't any safe.

1052
01:33:28,489 --> 01:33:30,320
There never was a safe.

1053
01:33:32,729 --> 01:33:34,287
Any other phones?

1054
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:37,167
One. In the kitchen.

1055
01:33:42,689 --> 01:33:44,361
Unlock this cabinet.

1056
01:33:44,489 --> 01:33:46,047
It's not locked.

1057
01:33:55,769 --> 01:33:57,122
Where is it?

1058
01:34:13,449 --> 01:34:15,007
Come on, move it.

1059
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:21,883
All right, now. The money, dig it up.

1060
01:34:30,969 --> 01:34:33,642
Thirty-one lousy dollars.

1061
01:34:35,529 --> 01:34:37,201
A rich man like you.

1062
01:34:38,489 --> 01:34:40,480
You gotta have more money than this.

1063
01:34:40,609 --> 01:34:43,123
Not in cash. I can write you a check.

1064
01:34:45,249 --> 01:34:46,204
A check?

1065
01:34:46,409 --> 01:34:48,969
-What kind of--
-Don't do that!

1066
01:34:49,049 --> 01:34:51,199
-There's somebody awake upstairs.
-My family.

1067
01:34:51,289 --> 01:34:53,166
The only people upstairs...

1068
01:34:53,449 --> 01:34:56,441
...are my wife, my son and daughter.

1069
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:59,163
Your wife, she got any money?

1070
01:34:59,329 --> 01:35:04,084
-Please, she's not well.
-Sure. Sure, pops.

1071
01:35:04,369 --> 01:35:08,567
-Upstairs.
-My glasses. I can't see without them.

1072
01:35:15,369 --> 01:35:16,802
Upstairs, upstairs.

1073
01:35:24,489 --> 01:35:26,878
Why do you boys want to do this?

1074
01:35:26,969 --> 01:35:28,368
I never harmed you.

1075
01:35:29,369 --> 01:35:33,487
-I never saw you before.
-Shut up. We'll tell you when to talk.

1076
01:35:40,329 --> 01:35:42,968
It's all right, sweetheart, don't be afraid.

1077
01:35:43,049 --> 01:35:45,563
These men, they just want some money.

1078
01:35:46,689 --> 01:35:48,805
They believe we have money
hidden in a safe.

1079
01:35:48,889 --> 01:35:52,245
-I told them we didn't, but they don't--
-Didn't l tell you to shut up?

1080
01:35:52,329 --> 01:35:55,127
He's telling you God's truth.
There isn't any safe.

1081
01:35:55,209 --> 01:35:59,487
I know goddamn well you got a safe.
And you better tell him to find it fast!

1082
01:36:05,649 --> 01:36:09,198
Floyd Wells lied to you.
There isn't any safe.

1083
01:36:12,329 --> 01:36:13,603
Tie them up.

1084
01:36:15,329 --> 01:36:17,843
Okay, lady. In the bathroom.

1085
01:36:26,529 --> 01:36:28,520
Please, don't hurt anybody.

1086
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:32,246
They don't mean to hurt anyone.
Isn't that right?

1087
01:36:37,809 --> 01:36:41,119
All they want is some money.
And then they'll go away.

1088
01:36:44,289 --> 01:36:47,042
Please, don't hurt the children.

1089
01:36:50,329 --> 01:36:53,127
Good grief! What is this?
Some kind of joke?

1090
01:36:57,289 --> 01:37:00,201
Make one move, holler once...

1091
01:37:00,689 --> 01:37:02,884
...and we'll cut their throats.

1092
01:37:03,849 --> 01:37:06,522
All right. You two, downstairs.

1093
01:37:31,849 --> 01:37:33,328
Dick! ln here.

1094
01:37:40,569 --> 01:37:42,127
You. Over there.

1095
01:38:10,889 --> 01:38:13,198
What's this? A casket?

1096
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:15,208
Hope chest.

1097
01:38:15,569 --> 01:38:17,605
It's a wedding present for my sister.

1098
01:38:19,609 --> 01:38:21,565
Not her. She's too young.

1099
01:38:22,609 --> 01:38:24,725
They're never too young, kid.

1100
01:38:30,729 --> 01:38:31,923
Pops!

1101
01:38:34,729 --> 01:38:37,448
You better pray l find that safe.

1102
01:38:48,729 --> 01:38:49,878
Kenyon?

1103
01:38:52,409 --> 01:38:53,444
Dad?

1104
01:39:13,769 --> 01:39:15,043
You're cold?

1105
01:39:15,369 --> 01:39:16,358
Yes.

1106
01:39:45,649 --> 01:39:48,083
If all you want is money, then why?

1107
01:39:50,569 --> 01:39:53,686
If you do that to my wife she'll panic.

1108
01:40:29,729 --> 01:40:33,881
My mother, please be careful. Please.

1109
01:40:58,489 --> 01:41:01,447
That other man,
l'm afraid he'll hurt someone.

1110
01:41:02,249 --> 01:41:04,809
Please, he can have money, anything...

1111
01:41:05,409 --> 01:41:09,004
...but, please,
don't let him hurt my little girl.

1112
01:41:12,009 --> 01:41:13,203
Don't....

1113
01:41:16,689 --> 01:41:18,361
You ever had a man?

1114
01:41:18,689 --> 01:41:20,281
Please, don't.

1115
01:41:27,209 --> 01:41:28,961
What's eating at you?

1116
01:41:29,409 --> 01:41:31,047
You find the safe?

1117
01:41:31,969 --> 01:41:33,482
Later.

1118
01:41:33,929 --> 01:41:36,523
-First l'm gonna bust that little girl.
-No.

1119
01:41:37,209 --> 01:41:40,121
What do you care? You can bust her, too.

1120
01:41:41,049 --> 01:41:42,004
No.

1121
01:41:44,009 --> 01:41:45,124
Okay, honey.

1122
01:41:49,249 --> 01:41:50,921
Get the kid's radio.

1123
01:41:52,449 --> 01:41:54,246
And then go downstairs.

1124
01:42:07,129 --> 01:42:10,724
I despise people
who can't control themselves.

1125
01:42:21,409 --> 01:42:22,967
You go to school?

1126
01:42:24,049 --> 01:42:25,198
The university...

1127
01:42:25,289 --> 01:42:28,167
...next year. To study music and art.

1128
01:42:30,569 --> 01:42:32,161
I play the guitar.

1129
01:42:33,129 --> 01:42:34,562
Draw some, too.

1130
01:42:37,089 --> 01:42:39,045
Only got as far as the third grade.

1131
01:42:42,889 --> 01:42:44,447
You like horses?

1132
01:42:46,169 --> 01:42:47,124
Yes.

1133
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:50,722
My mother...

1134
01:42:52,329 --> 01:42:56,038
...was a champion rider. In the rodeo.

1135
01:42:58,689 --> 01:43:00,247
And my father....

1136
01:43:07,209 --> 01:43:08,642
My father....

1137
01:43:38,889 --> 01:43:40,208
What's the matter?

1138
01:43:40,489 --> 01:43:44,482
Us. We're the matter. We're ridiculous.

1139
01:43:46,049 --> 01:43:48,438
You tapping the walls
for a safe that isn't there.

1140
01:43:48,529 --> 01:43:51,362
Tapping like some nutty woodpecker.

1141
01:43:53,129 --> 01:43:54,244
And me.

1142
01:43:55,369 --> 01:43:57,041
Crawling around the floor...

1143
01:43:57,249 --> 01:43:59,126
...with my legs on fire.

1144
01:44:02,409 --> 01:44:06,527
And all to steal a kid's silver dollar.

1145
01:44:10,809 --> 01:44:12,128
Ridiculous!

1146
01:44:13,449 --> 01:44:14,564
This is stupid!

1147
01:44:22,769 --> 01:44:25,602
What are you sore about? We got no beef.

1148
01:44:25,689 --> 01:44:27,407
It's us against them.

1149
01:44:28,849 --> 01:44:30,521
This is between us.

1150
01:44:31,489 --> 01:44:33,207
It's got nothing to do with them.

1151
01:44:37,369 --> 01:44:39,678
Look at me, boy! Take a good look!

1152
01:44:40,289 --> 01:44:43,247
I'm the last living thing
you're ever gonna see.

1153
01:46:04,849 --> 01:46:07,204
Don't. Please, don't.

1154
01:46:30,209 --> 01:46:31,688
It doesn't make sense.

1155
01:46:33,289 --> 01:46:34,642
I mean what happened.

1156
01:46:35,529 --> 01:46:36,484
Or why.

1157
01:46:38,569 --> 01:46:40,799
It had nothing to do with the Clutters.

1158
01:46:41,489 --> 01:46:44,640
They never hurt me,
they just happened to be there.

1159
01:46:46,769 --> 01:46:49,329
I thought Mr. Clutter
was a very nice gentleman.

1160
01:46:52,729 --> 01:46:55,527
I thought so right up until the time
l cut his throat.

1161
01:48:01,929 --> 01:48:04,159
Mercy for them.

1162
01:48:05,489 --> 01:48:06,444
The killers.

1163
01:48:08,129 --> 01:48:11,201
How fortunate
that their admirable attorneys...

1164
01:48:12,249 --> 01:48:15,924
...were not present at the Clutter home
that fateful evening.

1165
01:48:16,129 --> 01:48:18,768
How fortunate for them
that they were not there...

1166
01:48:18,849 --> 01:48:22,285
...to plead mercy for the doomed family...

1167
01:48:23,049 --> 01:48:25,005
...because otherwise...

1168
01:48:25,289 --> 01:48:27,484
...we would have found their corpses, too.

1169
01:48:29,209 --> 01:48:31,643
If you allow them life imprisonment...

1170
01:48:32,969 --> 01:48:36,120
...they will be eligible for parole
in seven years.

1171
01:48:36,849 --> 01:48:39,443
That is the law.

1172
01:48:41,809 --> 01:48:43,162
Gentlemen...

1173
01:48:43,729 --> 01:48:45,606
...four of your neighbours...

1174
01:48:46,009 --> 01:48:49,285
...were slaughtered like hogs in a pen...

1175
01:48:49,849 --> 01:48:51,168
...by them.

1176
01:48:53,609 --> 01:48:56,567
They did not strike in the heat of passion...

1177
01:48:57,129 --> 01:48:58,528
...but for money.

1178
01:48:59,489 --> 01:49:01,605
They did not kill in vengeance.

1179
01:49:02,089 --> 01:49:04,239
They planned it for money.

1180
01:49:05,289 --> 01:49:06,722
And how cheaply...

1181
01:49:07,169 --> 01:49:09,125
...those lives were bought.

1182
01:49:11,129 --> 01:49:12,244
$40.

1183
01:49:13,689 --> 01:49:15,520
$10 a life.

1184
01:49:17,049 --> 01:49:19,517
They drove 400 miles to come here...

1185
01:49:20,649 --> 01:49:23,004
...they brought their weapons with them.

1186
01:49:23,089 --> 01:49:26,718
This shotgun, this dagger.

1187
01:49:26,889 --> 01:49:30,199
This is the rope
that they hogtied their victims with.

1188
01:49:35,209 --> 01:49:37,439
This is the blood they spilled.

1189
01:49:41,929 --> 01:49:43,408
Herb Clutter's.

1190
01:49:45,569 --> 01:49:48,606
They who had no pity, now ask for yours.

1191
01:49:49,489 --> 01:49:52,799
They who had no mercy,
now ask for yours.

1192
01:49:53,609 --> 01:49:56,840
They who had no tears, now ask for yours.

1193
01:49:57,489 --> 01:50:01,038
If you have tears to shed,
weep not for them...

1194
01:50:02,249 --> 01:50:04,205
...weep for their victims.

1195
01:50:04,969 --> 01:50:09,679
From the way the Holy Bible
was quoted here today...

1196
01:50:10,089 --> 01:50:14,480
...you might think the word of God
was written only to protect the killers.

1197
01:50:14,889 --> 01:50:17,323
But they didn't read you this:

1198
01:50:18,409 --> 01:50:20,286
Exodus 20...

1199
01:50:20,889 --> 01:50:23,119
...verse 13:

1200
01:50:23,689 --> 01:50:26,157
"Thou shalt not kill."

1201
01:50:27,609 --> 01:50:28,564
Or this...

1202
01:50:29,169 --> 01:50:32,400
...Genesis 9, verse 1 2:

1203
01:50:33,369 --> 01:50:36,247
"Who so shedeth man's blood...

1204
01:50:36,849 --> 01:50:40,888
"...by man shall his blood be shed."

1205
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:53,442
It took four hours to pick thejury.

1206
01:50:54,729 --> 01:50:57,527
It took the sta.te three da.ys
to present its ca.se.

1207
01:50:59,889 --> 01:51:02,403
It took the defence one hour a.nd a. ha.If.

1208
01:51:04,809 --> 01:51:06,561
It took thejury...

1209
01:51:06,649 --> 01:51:09,004
...40 minutes to bring in the verdict.

1210
01:51:15,049 --> 01:51:16,801
They ha.d to be cra.zy.

1211
01:51:17,769 --> 01:51:21,284
No. Ma.ybe stupid, but perfectly sa.ne.

1212
01:51:22,929 --> 01:51:24,840
How ca.n a. perfectly sa.ne ma.n...

1213
01:51:26,209 --> 01:51:28,325
...commit a.n a.bsolutely cra.zy a.ct?

1214
01:51:53,889 --> 01:51:56,403
Ca.Iling a.Il sta.tions, Officer Linha.rd...

1215
01:51:56,649 --> 01:51:58,162
...Officer Bra.ckin.

1216
01:51:58,409 --> 01:52:00,479
Plea.se come to the desk sergea.nt's office.

1217
01:52:00,969 --> 01:52:03,164
Ca.Iling a.Il sta.tions, Officer C. Wright.

1218
01:52:04,889 --> 01:52:06,607
Plea.se ca.Il the desk sergea.nt.

1219
01:52:10,569 --> 01:52:13,447
-What happens now?
-They wait to die.

1220
01:52:15,409 --> 01:52:18,446
I wonder how many others
are waiting in other prisons?

1221
01:52:18,649 --> 01:52:19,923
About 200.

1222
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:31,560
Perry a.nd Dick bega.n their wa.iting
in the "S a.nd l" building...

1223
01:52:32,089 --> 01:52:34,398
...Security a.nd lsola.tion.

1224
01:52:37,009 --> 01:52:39,682
The second floor is dea.th row.

1225
01:52:49,049 --> 01:52:52,166
Through the window
they ca.n see the ba.seba.Il field.

1226
01:52:54,769 --> 01:52:57,283
Beyond the outfield, over the wa.Il...

1227
01:52:57,689 --> 01:53:00,681
...is a.n old wa.rehouse with a. tin roof.

1228
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:06,161
This warehouse got a name?

1229
01:53:07,609 --> 01:53:10,282
In this prison, it's called "The Corner."

1230
01:53:10,569 --> 01:53:14,357
On hanging day, the men say,
"He's gone to 'The Corner'."

1231
01:53:15,729 --> 01:53:18,289
Perry and Dick have a date at "The Corner."

1232
01:53:18,449 --> 01:53:23,125
One minute after midnight.
May, Friday 13.

1233
01:53:29,769 --> 01:53:32,647
According to a.n expert
in forensic medicine...

1234
01:53:33,129 --> 01:53:35,563
...neither one of them
would ha.ve done it a.Ione.

1235
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:38,562
But together,
they ma.de a. third persona.Iity.

1236
01:53:39,369 --> 01:53:40,961
Tha.t's the one tha.t did it.

1237
01:53:46,129 --> 01:53:47,403
Hey, Andy!

1238
01:53:48,689 --> 01:53:52,079
Does it tell anywhere in them books
what happens when you make the drop?

1239
01:53:53,569 --> 01:53:55,241
Well, your neck breaks...

1240
01:53:57,089 --> 01:53:59,080
...and you crap your pants.

1241
01:54:00,769 --> 01:54:04,239
The trouble with you, Andy,
you got no respect for human life...

1242
01:54:04,329 --> 01:54:06,047
...not even your own.

1243
01:54:26,089 --> 01:54:30,207
Doomsda.y, Frida.y 13, ca.me a.nd went...

1244
01:54:31,289 --> 01:54:33,166
...but no one went to "The Corner. "

1245
01:54:35,009 --> 01:54:37,523
Perry a.nd Dick a.ppea.Ied. Routine.

1246
01:54:39,289 --> 01:54:42,565
They were gra.nted a. sta.y of execution.
Routine.

1247
01:54:43,729 --> 01:54:48,723
The lega.I ma.chinery in ca.pita.I ca.ses
usua.Ily runs a. yea.r or more. Routine.

1248
01:54:49,769 --> 01:54:52,283
Dea.th row ha.s its own routine.

1249
01:54:54,329 --> 01:54:57,241
Shower. One ma.n a.t a. time, once a. week.

1250
01:54:58,249 --> 01:54:59,921
Sha.ve, twice a. week.

1251
01:55:00,489 --> 01:55:02,923
The gua.rd locks the sa.fety ra.zor.

1252
01:55:03,729 --> 01:55:05,128
Sa.fety first.

1253
01:55:06,209 --> 01:55:09,918
No ra.dios, no movies, no TV.

1254
01:55:11,209 --> 01:55:13,882
No ca.rds, no ga.mes, no exercise.

1255
01:55:15,049 --> 01:55:17,927
No mirrors, no bottles, no gla.sses.

1256
01:55:18,849 --> 01:55:20,521
No knives, no forks.

1257
01:55:21,449 --> 01:55:23,121
No suicide a.Ilowed.

1258
01:55:23,569 --> 01:55:25,446
They could ea.t, sleep...

1259
01:55:26,049 --> 01:55:28,961
...write, rea.d, think, drea.m.

1260
01:55:29,489 --> 01:55:31,719
They could pra.y, ifso inclined.

1261
01:55:31,929 --> 01:55:34,568
But mostly, theyjust wa.ited.

1262
01:55:36,689 --> 01:55:40,443
The guy in the next cell, Andy.
He's been waiting two years.

1263
01:55:41,049 --> 01:55:44,439
Newspapers call him
"The nicest boy in Kansas."

1264
01:55:45,329 --> 01:55:47,684
One night he killed his sister.

1265
01:55:48,649 --> 01:55:53,165
Then he shot his mother six times
and his father seventeen times.

1266
01:55:54,649 --> 01:55:56,287
Andy's a nut, but l like him.

1267
01:55:56,969 --> 01:55:59,688
Hey, Andy. Say hello to Mr. Jensen.

1268
01:56:00,249 --> 01:56:02,205
He's writing the story of my life.

1269
01:56:03,329 --> 01:56:04,318
Why?

1270
01:56:06,489 --> 01:56:08,286
I told you he was a nut.

1271
01:56:08,369 --> 01:56:11,361
Ronnie, Jim, meet Mr. Jensen.

1272
01:56:13,129 --> 01:56:16,121
They knocked off seven. Strangers.

1273
01:56:17,009 --> 01:56:19,523
Ronnie said they was better off dead.

1274
01:56:22,449 --> 01:56:25,043
What about Perry? Don't you get along?

1275
01:56:27,009 --> 01:56:29,603
Nobody can get along with him.

1276
01:56:30,489 --> 01:56:33,128
There's five guys waiting here
for the big swing.

1277
01:56:33,769 --> 01:56:37,523
Little Perry's the only one yapping
against capital punishment.

1278
01:56:38,369 --> 01:56:40,405
Don't tell me you're for it?

1279
01:56:41,209 --> 01:56:44,281
Hell, hanging's only getting revenge.

1280
01:56:45,369 --> 01:56:47,325
What's wrong with revenge?

1281
01:56:48,289 --> 01:56:50,723
I've been revenging myself all my life.

1282
01:56:52,369 --> 01:56:55,281
Sure. I'm for hanging.

1283
01:56:56,969 --> 01:56:59,767
Just so long as l'm not the one
being hanged.

1284
01:57:02,209 --> 01:57:03,164
See you.

1285
01:57:03,649 --> 01:57:05,560
Thanks for the magazines.

1286
01:57:07,049 --> 01:57:09,768
Jim, you think that looks like Willie Jay?

1287
01:57:10,329 --> 01:57:12,240
The way you see him, yes.

1288
01:57:14,609 --> 01:57:18,204
That day at the bus station,
when l phoned you.

1289
01:57:19,529 --> 01:57:23,238
If Willie Jay and l had connected,
none of this would of happened.

1290
01:57:23,329 --> 01:57:27,527
-Maybe, if you hadn't come back to Kansas.
-Maybe!

1291
01:57:27,929 --> 01:57:30,762
If they'd had a head-doctor here
during my first stretch...

1292
01:57:30,849 --> 01:57:33,443
...he would've known
l had a bomb ticking inside of me.

1293
01:57:33,529 --> 01:57:35,645
He would've known
l wasn't ready for parole.

1294
01:57:35,729 --> 01:57:37,128
-You knew.
-Yeah.

1295
01:57:37,609 --> 01:57:39,042
Why didn't you tell me?

1296
01:57:40,969 --> 01:57:44,245
Then l wouldn't have gotten my parole,
would l, Reverend?

1297
01:57:48,809 --> 01:57:51,926
A few minutes a.fter midnight,
in November...

1298
01:57:53,409 --> 01:57:55,604
...one of them went to "The Corner. "

1299
01:57:56,729 --> 01:58:01,280
The others wa.tched him cross the ba.Il field
on his wa.y to the ga.Ilows.

1300
01:58:02,529 --> 01:58:03,848
It wa.s Andy.

1301
01:58:04,569 --> 01:58:06,560
"The nicest boy in Ka.nsa.s. "

1302
01:58:13,769 --> 01:58:15,805
They hea.rd the tra.pdoor go.

1303
01:58:16,969 --> 01:58:20,962
They kept wa.tching a.nd wa.iting
for 19 minutes...

1304
01:58:21,409 --> 01:58:23,525
...till Andy's hea.rt stopped bea.ting.

1305
01:58:24,569 --> 01:58:27,242
For Andy, the wa.iting wa.s over.

1306
01:58:29,609 --> 01:58:31,884
Perry a.nd Dick wa.ited five yea.rs.

1307
01:58:32,609 --> 01:58:36,318
Three times their ca.se went
to the United Sta.tes Supreme Court.

1308
01:59:04,929 --> 01:59:07,682
My God! That harness!

1309
01:59:08,929 --> 01:59:13,161
Richard, this is a warrant from
the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas.

1310
01:59:13,729 --> 01:59:15,765
"Whereas, it was by this court ordered...

1311
01:59:15,849 --> 01:59:19,842
"...that execution of the sentence of death
by hanging of Richard Eugene Hickock...

1312
01:59:20,089 --> 01:59:23,047
"...imposed by the District Court
of Finney County, Kansas...

1313
01:59:23,129 --> 01:59:26,405
"...be carried out on Wednesday,
April 14, 1965.

1314
01:59:26,489 --> 01:59:29,242
"Commanding the warden
of the Kansas State Penitentiary...

1315
01:59:29,329 --> 01:59:31,399
"...to carry the sentence into execution."

1316
01:59:31,489 --> 01:59:32,808
Where's Smith?

1317
01:59:34,769 --> 01:59:37,124
"Yea, let none that wait for thee
be ashamed.

1318
01:59:37,209 --> 01:59:40,281
"Let them be ashamed
which transgress without cause.

1319
01:59:40,529 --> 01:59:43,407
"Show me thy ways, O Lord,
teach me thy paths.

1320
01:59:43,689 --> 01:59:46,647
"Lead me in thy truth, and teach me,
for thou art the God...."

1321
01:59:51,969 --> 01:59:53,687
I gotta go to the toilet.

1322
01:59:53,769 --> 01:59:57,000
We can't remove the harness.
There might not be time.

1323
01:59:58,489 --> 01:59:59,638
Please.

1324
01:59:59,769 --> 02:00:01,646
Try to control yourself.

1325
02:00:02,729 --> 02:00:04,162
But that's it.

1326
02:00:05,129 --> 02:00:08,804
When you hit the end of the rope
your muscles lose control.

1327
02:00:14,569 --> 02:00:16,446
I'm afraid l'll mess myself.

1328
02:00:16,529 --> 02:00:19,521
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
They all do it.

1329
02:00:20,209 --> 02:00:22,165
For God's sake, man!

1330
02:00:29,489 --> 02:00:33,448
"This is to command you, the warden
of the Kansas State Penitentiary...

1331
02:00:33,609 --> 02:00:36,919
"...that on Wednesday, April 14, 1965...

1332
02:00:37,329 --> 02:00:41,845
"...between the hours of 1 2:01 a.m.
and 2:00 a.m...."

1333
02:00:42,849 --> 02:00:44,407
Is he the....

1334
02:00:46,089 --> 02:00:48,398
How much does he get paid to hang them?

1335
02:00:48,489 --> 02:00:50,525
$300 a man.

1336
02:00:52,169 --> 02:00:53,761
Has he got a name?

1337
02:00:54,609 --> 02:00:56,088
"We, the people."

1338
02:00:57,609 --> 02:00:59,679
"...for the State of Kansas."

1339
02:00:59,769 --> 02:01:01,680
Anything you want to say?

1340
02:01:03,529 --> 02:01:07,522
Just that l hold no hard feelings.

1341
02:01:09,369 --> 02:01:13,282
You're sending me to a better world
than this ever was.

1342
02:01:18,249 --> 02:01:19,682
Nice to see you.

1343
02:01:37,569 --> 02:01:40,003
Jim, Thoreau...

1344
02:01:41,129 --> 02:01:42,926
...on man and nature.

1345
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:45,848
It's yours if you want it.

1346
02:01:48,369 --> 02:01:49,643
Dick gone?

1347
02:01:50,969 --> 02:01:52,960
Is his heart still beating?

1348
02:01:57,329 --> 02:01:59,763
-What time is it?
-Take it easy, kid.

1349
02:02:03,809 --> 02:02:06,403
Would you like me to write your father?

1350
02:02:08,849 --> 02:02:11,409
I could send him one of your paintings.

1351
02:02:11,489 --> 02:02:13,480
Or maybe your Bronze Star.

1352
02:02:18,089 --> 02:02:20,045
Send him my treasure maps.

1353
02:02:21,409 --> 02:02:23,365
Maybe now he'll get lucky.

1354
02:02:25,769 --> 02:02:27,441
The Lone Wolf.

1355
02:02:30,249 --> 02:02:34,925
You know, there was a time once
when we almost had it made.

1356
02:02:36,169 --> 02:02:37,807
Just the two of us.

1357
02:02:39,329 --> 02:02:43,845
He was in a fever about some new project
up in Alaska.

1358
02:02:44,649 --> 02:02:46,685
A hunting lodge for tourists.

1359
02:02:46,769 --> 02:02:50,921
It was gonna make us a fortune
better than a gold mine.

1360
02:02:52,529 --> 02:02:56,363
But most of all, it was gonna be something
we never had before:

1361
02:02:57,769 --> 02:02:59,248
A real home.

1362
02:03:00,529 --> 02:03:02,042
We got it built, too.

1363
02:03:02,249 --> 02:03:04,763
Just him and me, side by side.

1364
02:03:05,289 --> 02:03:09,441
The day the roof was finished,
he danced all over it.

1365
02:03:10,929 --> 02:03:13,363
I never was so happy in all my life.

1366
02:03:14,689 --> 02:03:17,123
It was a beautiful home.

1367
02:03:22,609 --> 02:03:24,884
But no tourists ever came.

1368
02:03:25,929 --> 02:03:27,726
Nobody.

1369
02:03:29,609 --> 02:03:31,201
We just lived there...

1370
02:03:31,449 --> 02:03:35,681
...all alone in that big, empty failure...

1371
02:03:39,729 --> 02:03:42,323
...till he couldn't stand the sight of me.

1372
02:03:45,769 --> 02:03:47,521
I think it happened....

1373
02:03:49,729 --> 02:03:51,685
I was eating a biscuit.

1374
02:03:52,969 --> 02:03:56,325
He started yelling what a greedy,
selfish bastard l was.

1375
02:03:57,369 --> 02:03:59,599
Yelling and yelling till l grabbed his throat.

1376
02:03:59,689 --> 02:04:01,486
I couldn't stop myself.

1377
02:04:01,969 --> 02:04:04,005
He tore loose and got a gun.

1378
02:04:05,649 --> 02:04:08,004
He said, "Look at me, boy!

1379
02:04:09,729 --> 02:04:14,041
"Take a good look 'cause
l'm the last living thing you're gonna see."

1380
02:04:17,769 --> 02:04:19,725
And he pulled the trigger.

1381
02:04:22,529 --> 02:04:24,485
But the gun wasn't loaded.

1382
02:04:26,489 --> 02:04:28,002
He began to cry.

1383
02:04:30,769 --> 02:04:32,361
Bawled like a kid.

1384
02:04:34,569 --> 02:04:36,161
I went for a long walk.

1385
02:04:37,969 --> 02:04:40,085
When l got back, the place was dark.

1386
02:04:41,129 --> 02:04:42,847
The door was locked.

1387
02:04:44,209 --> 02:04:47,360
All my stuff was piled outside
in the snow...

1388
02:04:47,849 --> 02:04:49,487
...where he threw it.

1389
02:04:49,929 --> 02:04:52,807
I walked away and never looked back.

1390
02:04:55,769 --> 02:04:59,045
I guess the only thing l'm gonna miss
in this world...

1391
02:05:00,449 --> 02:05:02,246
...is that poor old man...

1392
02:05:03,969 --> 02:05:06,722
...and his hopeless dreams.

1393
02:05:10,769 --> 02:05:13,602
I'm glad you don't hate
your father anymore.

1394
02:05:15,089 --> 02:05:16,317
But l do.

1395
02:05:18,969 --> 02:05:20,288
I hate him.

1396
02:05:22,889 --> 02:05:24,322
And l love him.

1397
02:05:50,369 --> 02:05:52,360
-Coming?
-What for?

1398
02:05:52,609 --> 02:05:54,565
What does it add up to, anyway?

1399
02:05:55,049 --> 02:05:58,166
Well, four innocent
and two guilty people murdered.

1400
02:05:58,249 --> 02:06:00,046
Three families broken.

1401
02:06:00,529 --> 02:06:02,406
Newspapers have sold more papers.

1402
02:06:02,489 --> 02:06:04,719
Politicians will make more speeches.

1403
02:06:05,089 --> 02:06:07,887
Police and parole boards
will get more blame.

1404
02:06:08,969 --> 02:06:10,607
More laws will be passed.

1405
02:06:10,809 --> 02:06:13,084
Everybody will pass the buck.

1406
02:06:13,449 --> 02:06:17,044
And then, next month, next year...

1407
02:06:18,089 --> 02:06:20,000
...the same thing will happen again.

1408
02:06:20,569 --> 02:06:23,083
Well, maybe this will help to stop it.

1409
02:06:23,729 --> 02:06:25,003
Never has.

1410
02:06:40,329 --> 02:06:44,959
This is a warrant from the Supreme Court
of the State of Kansas.

1411
02:06:46,649 --> 02:06:50,562
"lt was by the court ordered that execution
of the sentence of death by hanging...

1412
02:06:50,649 --> 02:06:52,128
"...of Perry Edward Smith...

1413
02:06:52,209 --> 02:06:55,121
"...imposed by the District Court
of Finney County, Kansas...

1414
02:06:55,209 --> 02:06:58,565
"...be carried out on Wednesday,
April 14, 1965."

1415
02:07:01,889 --> 02:07:03,800
Anything you want to say?

1416
02:07:11,089 --> 02:07:12,681
I think maybe...

1417
02:07:15,529 --> 02:07:17,918
...l'd like to apologize.

1418
02:07:19,969 --> 02:07:21,288
But who to?

1419
02:07:43,009 --> 02:07:45,921
"The Lord is my shepherd,
l shall not want...

1420
02:07:46,089 --> 02:07:48,808
"...he maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1421
02:07:48,969 --> 02:07:51,483
"He leadeth me beside the still waters...

1422
02:07:51,569 --> 02:07:53,287
"...he restoreth my soul.

1423
02:07:53,849 --> 02:07:57,444
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1424
02:07:57,969 --> 02:08:01,723
"Yea, though l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

1425
02:08:01,929 --> 02:08:03,840
"...l will fear no evil...

1426
02:08:04,049 --> 02:08:05,687
"...for thou art with me...

1427
02:08:05,769 --> 02:08:08,408
"...thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1428
02:08:09,129 --> 02:08:12,644
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies...

1429
02:08:12,809 --> 02:08:15,039
"...thou anointest my head with oil..."

1430
02:08:15,769 --> 02:08:17,725
Is God in this place, too?

1431
02:08:20,769 --> 02:08:22,441
"...my cup runneth over.

1432
02:08:23,689 --> 02:08:27,682
"Surely goodness and mercy
will follow me all the days of my life...

1433
02:08:28,529 --> 02:08:31,680
"...and l will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."
