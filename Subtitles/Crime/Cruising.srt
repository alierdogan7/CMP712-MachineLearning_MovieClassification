1
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,023
Captain.

2
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,220
Something off the port bow.

3
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,347
See if you can match it to that torso
that came in last month.

4
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,611
Otherwise, you know, doc,
"circumstances undetermined...

5
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:46,187
-...pending a police investigation."
-Wait a minute.

6
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,345
We got a hand here.

7
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,618
If we can get a fingerprint,
we can make this a homicide.

8
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:53,024
All right, you give me a cause of death.

9
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,925
I can't give you
a cause from this.

10
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,658
It's obvious it's not a suicide,
and it's not a natural.

11
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:01,167
Doc, you know I can't prosecute a homicide
without a cause of death.

12
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:04,135
That means I'd have to go out
and find the rest of the body.

13
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:07,105
No good, doc.
I got too much on my plate now.

14
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:10,542
Just a numbers game, huh?
Body count? That's all it is to you guys.

15
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,681
The only way you'll prosecute a murder...

16
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,182
...is if you've got a guy downtown
signing a confession.

17
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:28,493
She ain't gonna make
a fool out of me.

18
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,726
Takes the kids and goes to Florida
to see her sister, leaves me a note.

19
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,460
Ten years.

20
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:37,197
-They're all scumbags.
-What?

21
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:39,102
They're all scumbags.

22
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,539
-Who?
-All of them.

23
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:43,178
You're better off.

24
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:44,438
Just drive the car, huh?

25
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,277
You'll be driving this car the rest
of your life. You don't know nothing.

26
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:53,181
I'll get that bitch.

27
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:55,824
She ain't gonna jerk me around.

28
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:57,425
I'll get her.

29
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,256
-You'll get her.
-Damn straight I will.

30
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,628
One day this whole city
is gonna explode.

31
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:10,200
Used to be able to play stickball
on these streets.

32
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:13,434
Now look at these guys.

33
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,170
Christ, what's happening?

34
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,114
Hey, girls, you working?

35
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:28,421
-You buying?
-No, honey, I ain't buying.

36
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:29,615
Hey, what is that?

37
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,654
You'll break your ass you fall down
in those high heels.

38
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,730
-Yeah, so will your sister.
-My what?

39
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:37,594
Come here, I'll break your face.

40
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,257
Come here.

41
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,369
Hey, man, give us a break, okay?

42
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:43,061
I said, come here.

43
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,867
Come on, you already hauled
my ass in last week, hard-on.

44
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:47,441
A lot of good it did me.

45
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,068
Come on, baby, I cannot handle
another bust this month.

46
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:54,978
Hey, look, you're on my corner again,
shithead. You know what that means?

47
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:59,047
Get in the car.

48
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,684
In the car.

49
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:08,355
Pussy.

50
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:16,664
You remind me of a fella
I used to know.

51
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,371
He used to be a coke sucker.

52
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:24,876
Before that he was a cork soaker.

53
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,575
-You guys are hilarious.
-Yeah?

54
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,486
Come up here.
I wanna show you my nightstick.

55
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:37,924
Move your ass.

56
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:40,793
Get up here.

57
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,201
Do I qualify?

58
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,838
-I hate cigarettes.
-Oh, really?

59
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,474
-I think they're disgusting.
-Well, I enjoy them.

60
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,166
All it is is anal regression.

61
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,575
If you wanna quit, I suggest you try
another form of childhood stroke.

62
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:12,736
I don't wanna quit.

63
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:14,712
I suggest you try
an ostrich feather...

64
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:18,217
...along the small of your back,
up your spine to the nape of your neck.

65
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,684
Sounds addictive.

66
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,017
-Why do you come here?
-Why do you?

67
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,127
Because I'm having ego problems,
I need to be worshiped and adored.

68
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,160
-Where you from?
-Mars.

69
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:31,425
Terrific. I never made it
with a Martian before.

70
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:11,690
What are you doing?

71
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:21,193
Just looking for a pack of cigarettes.

72
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:24,232
Why, are you afraid?

73
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:28,869
Should I be?

74
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,112
Have you ever been ripped off?

75
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,782
I don't have anything to take.

76
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:46,261
I can't believe you're not afraid.

77
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,006
Who's here?

78
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:04,874
I'm here

79
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,572
You're here

80
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,912
Now I'm afraid.

81
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,647
Yeah.

82
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:16,124
Lie down.

83
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,422
Go on.

84
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,921
Lie down.

85
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:29,532
Yeah.

86
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,934
Turn over.

87
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:38,103
-What?
-I said, turn over.

88
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:46,252
-What are you gonna do?
-I know what I have to do.

89
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:14,876
Please.

90
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,287
I don't wanna make this
too tight for you.

91
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,285
Please. Please.

92
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,484
Please. Please. Plea--

93
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,823
You made me do that.

94
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,008
Anus was dilated
at the time of death...

95
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,013
...slight rupture above the anus
indicating intercourse.

96
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,514
We found semen...

97
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,879
...but I can't identify it.

98
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,588
-What do you mean?
-Aspermia.

99
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:55,451
In English.

100
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:58,115
No sperm. Your killer's shooting blanks.

101
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:02,253
His semen tested positively,
but it doesn't have any sperm in it.

102
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,898
Why not?

103
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:07,934
Well, maybe he has some
physical aberration or a malfunction.

104
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:12,506
Could be his testes are infected,
maybe he had a vasectomy.

105
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,472
What else?

106
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,804
Well, this first wound here,
that's clean...

107
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:19,209
...which means
he never knew it was coming.

108
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:23,909
But this one and these, they're defensive,
which means he tried to resist.

109
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:26,281
So we have a top-to-bottom grouping...

110
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:30,391
...and from the angle of entry,
I'd say your killer was right-handed.

111
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:33,724
-This knife is leaving its own fingerprints.
-That's right.

112
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,729
And from the serrations,
the width of the cut, the depth...

113
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,890
...approximately 3 inches
into the flesh...

114
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,595
...I'd say it matches the other killing
pretty close. Close enough.

115
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,806
I know him. Yeah, I know this guy.

116
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,538
He don't come around no more.

117
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:55,149
He beat some guys
out of some bread.

118
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:01,047
I know this dude too.
I seen him on the deuce.

119
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:03,885
He gives the best beatings
like six ways from Sunday.

120
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,550
Didn't you work uptown with him?

121
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:08,993
Work uptown with him, man? No.

122
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:11,064
I don't work with nobody.

123
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,225
A john just comes to me
and tells me what he wants.

124
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:16,166
Have fantasy will travel.

125
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,732
Well, that fellow was seen with
the Columbia professor who got whacked.

126
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,105
And he says that you introduced him.

127
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,406
That's possible. See?

128
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:27,310
But this guy ain't no killer.

129
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:30,008
I mean he's a pull-together hustler.

130
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:32,016
All right.

131
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,120
I gotta talk to you, alone.

132
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,125
Okay.

133
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,729
I need a favor, man.

134
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:49,029
These two cops
working out of 6th Precinct...

135
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:50,569
...they been leaning on me.

136
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:52,138
Who are they?

137
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,072
I think one guy's name is Simone
or something like that.

138
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:57,303
The other guy is Jerry something
or whatever.

139
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,107
They're partners.
A couple of real fucking hard-ons.

140
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:02,113
And dig, they run me
the other night...

141
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:05,685
...and this guy Simone, he made me
give him head right in his radio car.

142
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:08,186
Take your foot off the table.

143
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,447
You're full of shit.

144
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:13,720
-I swear to Christ.
-How do you know they're cops?

145
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:17,221
Because they're wearing shields
and riding around in a radio car.

146
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,459
-What are their shield numbers?
-They work out of the 6th Precinct.

147
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:23,537
Do you know how many guys
are arrested for impersonating a cop?

148
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:27,335
There's more guys out there impersonating
cops than there are actual cops.

149
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,171
-I need this favor, man.
-Do you wanna put on a wire?

150
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,440
I'll take you down to lnternal Affairs,
we'll draw up a complaint.

151
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,914
Listen to what I'm saying.
These guys are bad dudes.

152
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:40,317
You get me names or numbers,
otherwise don't come around with stories.

153
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:43,117
Listen, man, you need me
just as much as I need you.

154
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:45,317
Take a hike.

155
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,392
Son of a bitch.

156
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,907
-Captain Edelstein?
-It's Edelson.

157
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,341
I'm sorry. I'm Steve Burns.

158
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,038
Close the door. Sit down.

159
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,518
Burns.

160
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:20,321
Why do you think
you were called down here?

161
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,256
I don't know.
They told me that there was some...

162
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,798
...special assignment...

163
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,993
...and that I was right for it.

164
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,331
Let me ask you something.

165
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:33,199
Have you ever had
your cock sucked by a man?

166
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,438
A man? No.

167
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,409
-Well, I--
-Ever been porked?

168
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,913
Or had a man smoke your pole?

169
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,551
You gotta be kidding.

170
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,745
Yeah, you're kidding, I knew it.

171
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,116
No.

172
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,418
No? Well, they got the wrong guy,
I guess, that's all.

173
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,255
Take a look at the board over there.

174
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:59,760
Paul Vincent was a professor
at Columbia University.

175
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,460
Loren Lukas was an actor.

176
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:05,903
Oh, the St. James Hotel stabbing.
I read about that.

177
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,307
How'd you like to disappear?

178
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:12,606
-Disappear?
-Go undercover.

179
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,814
These killings have a similar m.o...

180
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:22,418
...but we've also been finding parts
of bodies floating in the river.

181
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,022
We don't know a thing
about these torso victims.

182
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:27,253
We don't even know
who the hell they are yet.

183
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:32,128
It's my hunch that they were done by the
same guy who did these killings up here.

184
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,626
So why me?

185
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,102
Well, frankly, all of the victims
appear to be the same physical type.

186
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:40,537
Which is to say,
they all look like you.

187
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:44,145
Late 20s, 140, 150 pounds.

188
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,838
Dark hair, dark eyes.

189
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,107
I see.

190
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:52,151
I wanna send you out there
to see if you can attract this guy.

191
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:54,345
Out where?

192
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:58,858
Lukas and Vincent were not
in the mainstream of gay life.

193
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:02,258
They were into heavy leather. S & M.

194
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,228
It's a world unto itself.

195
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,368
I don't know how much you know
about that sort of thing.

196
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,737
If you take this assignment...

197
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:13,068
...you'll come out with more experience
than any of my detectives.

198
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,240
Do I carry a gun?

199
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:22,679
No gun, no shield.
You get paid once a month.

200
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,480
You get a call telling you where to pick up
the money. You report only to me.

201
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:30,091
And nobody can know anything
about what you're doing.

202
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,727
Up the creek without a paddle, huh?

203
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,920
What do you say?

204
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,667
Yeah, I love it.

205
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:53,277
What's this new thing you're doing?

206
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,277
I can't talk about it, Nance, I told you.

207
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:01,549
Why not?

208
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,658
Because I just can't...

209
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:07,125
...so please don't ask me, okay?

210
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:09,389
Don't ask me.

211
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,594
How long are you gonna be gone?

212
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,097
Oh, I don't know.

213
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,109
Is it dangerous?

214
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,337
I don't know.

215
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:27,982
I think it is, yeah.

216
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,250
Why do it, then?

217
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:38,088
Skip patrol, gold shield right away.

218
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,954
Can we talk about something else, yeah?

219
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,767
Your father called today.

220
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,800
Yeah?

221
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,045
Gold shield?

222
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,447
I didn't realize you were so ambitious.

223
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:10,055
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

224
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,555
Such as?

225
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:04,635
Hi.

226
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:07,240
-Hi.
-When'd you move in?

227
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,809
Yesterday. Yesterday afternoon.

228
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:12,946
I must have been asleep
with the air conditioner on.

229
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:15,208
I've been sleeping days
and working nights.

230
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,784
Like Fidel Castro,
only he's running a whole country.

231
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,215
Right.

232
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,650
I'm Ted Bailey.

233
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,583
I'm John Forbes.

234
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,521
-Hi.
-Hi.

235
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,058
Doing a little house cleaning?

236
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:28,492
Oh, these, yeah.
Somebody left them in my closet.

237
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:31,962
Yeah, that was Bobby.
He had exotic tastes.

238
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,068
Don't put them in the trash bin.

239
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:37,228
Mrs. McGuire likes it
if we stack our magazines.

240
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:38,464
She sells them.

241
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,166
-You're putting me on.
-No.

242
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:46,007
She hasn't figured out how to sell ordinary
garbage, so that she lets us throw out.

243
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,739
And don't hang any pictures.

244
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,406
I know, she told me.

245
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:54,347
Hey, you got time for a cup of coffee?
Really primo, right down the street.

246
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:55,922
Dinnertime I only eat seafood.

247
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:58,753
I gotta watch myself
or I balloon up like Shelley Winters.

248
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,792
It's worse when I'm working
on something.

249
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,896
I hope my typing didn't bother you.

250
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,225
What are you working on?

251
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:06,128
I'm trying to finish a play.

252
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,235
Oh, yeah? What kind of play?

253
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:12,339
Boy meets boy, boy loses boy,
boy ends up with analyst.

254
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:13,974
It's a light romantic comedy.

255
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,873
It's old-fashioned and sophisticated.
The kind nobody's interested in anymore.

256
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:20,674
-Hey, come here.
-Well, I hope that doesn't bother you.

257
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:24,250
Hell, no. Listen, it'd be hard to be
ignored if I was Paddy Chayefsky...

258
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,047
...but I'm just trying to make a buck. Hey.

259
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:32,388
Things are tough right now,
but I feel it's my destiny to be recognized.

260
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:35,226
My roommate works steadily,
so we get by.

261
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,523
What's your roommate do?

262
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:39,223
He's a dancer. Gregory Milanese.

263
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,596
He's out of town right now
working on a musical.

264
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,433
He's trying out in Westport or someplace.
So I'm at loose ends, so to speak.

265
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:46,665
How about yourself?

266
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:51,973
Oh, I just quit school. Art school.
Looking for a job, commercial artist.

267
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:54,741
-Good luck.
-Yeah.

268
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,747
So where you been living?

269
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:59,978
Well, I was living
in the Bronx with my folks.

270
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:03,255
The first Braille waitress.

271
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,522
Hey, did you read about the killings?

272
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,391
-Homo killer on the prowl?
-Yeah, I was reading about that.

273
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:11,555
Talk of every gay bar in town.

274
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,725
-Scared to death of cruising myself.
-They're gonna get that guy.

275
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:16,700
-The cops are gonna get him.
-The cops?

276
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,831
Listen, if they get their hands on him, they'll
make him a member of the Vice Squad.

277
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:25,343
Let me tell you. We had another killing
like this one about five or six months ago.

278
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:28,881
I don't even think it made the papers.
But we heard about it around here.

279
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,950
The victim was a teacher at Columbia.

280
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,078
They found him in his apartment
in about 1 0 pieces.

281
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:43,457
Detectives came around asking questions
for a couple of days, nothing came of it.

282
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:45,395
I guess you can't be too careful, huh?

283
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:11,677
Excuse me.

284
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:13,844
Could I ask you about these?

285
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:15,614
What about them?

286
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,054
What are they for?

287
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:21,662
A light-blue hanky in your left back pocket
means you want a blow job...

288
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,060
...right pocket means you give one.

289
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:28,328
The green one, left side says
you're a hustler, right side you're a buyer.

290
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,199
The yellow one, left side means
you give golden shower...

291
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:35,002
-...right side you receive. The red one is--
-Right, thank you.

292
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,337
See anything you want?

293
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,042
I'm gonna go home
and think about it.

294
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:43,878
I'm sure you'll make the right choice.

295
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:53,949
You into water sports?

296
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,084
No, I just-- I like to watch.

297
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:02,960
-Later.
-Yeah.

298
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:07,261
If you like to watch, take that hanky
out of your pocket, asshole.

299
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:24,810
Yes.

300
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:27,383
Yes.

301
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,280
Yes.

302
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:33,456
Yes.

303
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:37,255
Yes.

304
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:12,993
-How you doing?
-Good.

305
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:15,561
Bartenders are starting
to give me some information.

306
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,425
You know, like who the regulars are.

307
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,625
Who's been there before,
who ain't, that stuff.

308
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:23,362
Good. What else?

309
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:26,473
Oh, yeah, there's this name
keeps popping up all the time.

310
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:28,632
Tommy Mancusi.

311
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,040
He owns the Cock Pit,
four, five other places.

312
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:33,806
Tommy the Joker they call him.

313
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:36,849
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

314
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,854
Are you trying to tell me you don't know
who Tommy the Joker is?

315
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:43,714
I don't know who he is.

316
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:46,460
Well, I do. I can't move on him.

317
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:48,459
Why not?

318
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,129
I ask the questions.

319
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:57,199
You dropped your chalk.

320
00:30:57,805 --> 00:30:59,864
-See you later.
-Watch yourself.

321
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,508
You bet.

322
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:07,444
I think he's cruising.

323
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,603
-Great night.
-Yeah, it is.

324
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:38,610
-Wanna get a beer?
-Oh, I don't know. It's kind of late.

325
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:42,814
I'd invite you up to my apartment,
but I don't have air conditioning yet.

326
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,077
Oh, that's too bad.

327
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,778
-How about the park?
-Fine.

328
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:52,816
Who 's here?

329
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:55,182
I'm here

330
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:58,120
You're here

331
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,013
Where are you, man?

332
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:29,323
Come on.

333
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:31,818
Where are you?

334
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:44,528
Don't play games with me, man.

335
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,540
Where are you?

336
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:54,011
I'm waiting for you

337
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,938
-Everything's ready.
-Good.

338
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,541
Nance....

339
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,711
Why don't you lie down
for a little while?

340
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,551
Don't let me lose you.

341
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:13,159
Okay?

342
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:18,655
-Don't let me lose you.
-I love you.

343
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:21,298
You're not gonna lose me.

344
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:24,835
I love you so much.

345
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:27,973
Gregory called me last night.

346
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:29,905
Remember roommate Gregory?

347
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:33,945
Seems the star of the show has hepatitis
and the tour is canceled till he recovers.

348
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,879
Show closes in Bucks County tonight,
he'll be home tomorrow.

349
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,281
-That should make you happy.
-Overjoyed.

350
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:42,115
Listen, I never told you
about Gregory and me.

351
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,258
You know what he said
when he called me up?

352
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:48,862
He said I should forget about my writing
and find a job until his show reopens.

353
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,328
He says it's my turn to work now.

354
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:54,195
He intends to flop on the beach
and turn nut brown.

355
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:57,064
His very words. Damn.

356
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,399
I was counting on having
the rest of the summer.

357
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,201
I could've finished by Labor Day.

358
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,673
-So tell him.
-I did.

359
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:06,109
At which point, dear Gregory said...

360
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,078
...that the world could wait
for any play I might turn out...

361
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,741
...but the summer sun
waits for no man.

362
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:16,583
Who knows?

363
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,191
He might be right about this play.

364
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:23,330
He was right, God knows,
about the others I've written.

365
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,859
Nobody else cared much
about them either.

366
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:31,935
So I guess I'll work my bricks off.

367
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:33,840
We need the money.

368
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:36,476
Gregory's tired.

369
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:39,335
It's fair enough, I suppose.

370
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:44,109
You really feel like that?

371
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,150
No.

372
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:49,983
I'm seething.

373
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:54,555
I'm not exactly mad enough to kill,
but I am mad enough for something.

374
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:58,222
Bobby, the guy that
used to have your room...

375
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,993
...he used to get this way, only worse.

376
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,829
He'd slam out the door,
go stomping off down the stairs.

377
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,403
I never knew what set him off,
but later he'd tell me where he went.

378
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:11,408
Usually the baths.

379
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,810
He'd check in,
blow a dozen guys in an hour.

380
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,041
You ready for that?

381
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:19,612
No.

382
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:22,119
I'm not ready for that.

383
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,087
But I understand...

384
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:27,727
...what made him feel that way.

385
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:34,100
I hate Mondays.

386
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,234
Oh, Ted, I wish I could help you.

387
00:37:39,774 --> 00:37:42,038
Do something for you.

388
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:45,845
You do?

389
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:49,315
You do.

390
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:17,227
Where you going, friend?

391
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:22,041
-What do you mean?
-Got a knife, gun, anything at all?

392
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:25,244
-Why? What's wrong?
-You a police officer?

393
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:28,246
-What?
-This is Precinct Night.

394
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:33,115
You got the wrong attitude. I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

395
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,320
Right.

396
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,397
You looking for something?

397
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:26,133
That bulge in your pants ain't a knife.

398
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:28,502
Why don't we take a walk?

399
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:34,372
Yeah.

400
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,444
Not tonight.

401
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:59,592
Joey, you'll come before 7
on Sunday night, won't you?

402
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,759
Cross my heart. I'll be on the island
if you need to reach me.

403
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,131
I don't have that number.

404
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:06,899
It's on the wall in your kitchen
under "reminders."

405
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:09,133
All right. You know
how paranoid Bess gets...

406
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,211
...if dinner starts after 8
the night before she's shooting.

407
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:13,471
Not to worry.

408
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:17,242
Not to worry? I have Margo's dress to finish.
She opens in Vegas in two weeks.

409
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:20,478
-Have fun.
-I'll try.

410
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:05,741
You made me do that.

411
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,188
As if it's your place.

412
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,699
-It's mine as much as yours.
-As if it-- The hell it is.

413
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,100
-When did you pay rent?
-I paid rent...

414
00:45:25,272 --> 00:45:29,504
-...which I know you get out your candy ass.
-Mary, you just listen to me.

415
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,200
-In Westport, is it?
-Yeah.

416
00:45:31,378 --> 00:45:34,506
-When you gonna work on Broadway?
-When am I gonna work on Broadway?

417
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,673
As soon as you get a play
that gets on Broadway.

418
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:40,979
-How did he get hepatitis?
-That's none of your goddamn business.

419
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,349
-None of my business?
-No.

420
00:45:42,523 --> 00:45:46,015
-You're asking me about my life.
-I'm not asking you about your life.

421
00:45:46,193 --> 00:45:48,354
I see what it is.
I don't have to ask a thing.

422
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:50,394
-What is it?
-What is it? I told you.

423
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:53,260
-It's a ridiculous, idiotic--
-You can see what I wanna do.

424
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:55,664
-That's what it is, a flop play.
-You can see it.

425
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,827
-Your life is a flop play.
-Let's see yours.

426
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,667
-Your life is just beating my ass, man.
-That's life.

427
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,969
Get someone else. I don't think
you'll find anything as big as this.

428
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:07,170
Bullshit, man. I can find anybody I want.

429
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,145
-Oh, you're so good-looking and so fine.
-Yeah. Yeah.

430
00:46:10,317 --> 00:46:12,080
-Answer just one question.
-Yeah.

431
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:13,378
One simple question.

432
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:16,045
When you gonna get
into that stupid head of yours...?

433
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:21,992
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

434
00:46:22,162 --> 00:46:27,099
I'm making $650 a week dancing
my ass off, while you're just playing....

435
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:30,430
You're making nothing. Right now,
what do you make? I gotta pay the rent.

436
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:39,274
P.C.'s on the phone,
the mayor's on the phone.

437
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:44,383
Every gay group in the city.
They're stomping around my office all day.

438
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:46,911
Now, what in Christ more
do you need, Dave?

439
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:49,851
I just have to do more
with the information I already have.

440
00:46:50,424 --> 00:46:53,484
Dave, you got 23 years on the job.

441
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:57,187
I'd like to see you go out
on a high note...

442
00:46:57,364 --> 00:47:00,356
...but both our reputations
are at stake on this one.

443
00:47:00,534 --> 00:47:03,059
I went to the P.C.,
I recommended you for the squad...

444
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,604
...and I am not going to have this thing
explode on me.

445
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:08,138
I understand that.

446
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:09,673
So wrap it up.

447
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:11,276
I don't care how you do it.

448
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:14,903
You clean this thing up before
the Democratic convention comes in...

449
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:19,985
...or I will put somebody
in your office who can.

450
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,762
Skipper, we found this quarter
in the coin box at the peep show.

451
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:36,392
The blood matches the victim's,
but not this print we lifted from it.

452
00:48:42,135 --> 00:48:43,762
-Hey, asshole.
-Come on.

453
00:48:43,937 --> 00:48:45,165
-Take a walk.
-Take it easy.

454
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,570
Take a walk?
I'll tear your goddamn head off.

455
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,779
The guy by the pinball machine.

456
00:48:53,947 --> 00:48:55,141
The guy with the....

457
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:56,873
The eagle on his jacket.

458
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,177
Oh, yeah, his name's Skip Lee.

459
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,479
He's a bad dude.

460
00:49:00,654 --> 00:49:04,112
The other night he got stoned out.
Came on to a guy at the Eagle's Nest.

461
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,919
The guy gave him the swerve.
Skip went for his throat.

462
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:09,961
Leave him alone. He's a scumbag.

463
00:49:16,336 --> 00:49:18,236
Hey, baby, what's happening?

464
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:20,270
I'm with someone.

465
00:49:21,074 --> 00:49:24,510
Aren't we all? Wanna dance?

466
00:51:07,447 --> 00:51:08,471
There he is.

467
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,173
-The one with the red scarf?
-No, the one with the hat.

468
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:12,716
-The one on the outside.
-Yeah.

469
00:51:12,886 --> 00:51:15,150
He calls himself Skip.
I don't know his last name.

470
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,914
He's been in a lot of hassles here.

471
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,251
-Is that the one that followed you?
-Yeah.

472
00:51:19,426 --> 00:51:21,155
Why didn't you go with him?

473
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,522
I don't know.

474
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:25,126
I kind of choked...

475
00:51:25,298 --> 00:51:27,391
...but I think you should check him.

476
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,658
The red card you win,
the black card you lose.

477
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:33,294
I said watch my red card not my black.
That's a black and that's a black.

478
00:51:33,473 --> 00:51:35,600
-I won't say that. Anybody else?
-Can I bid 10?

479
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:37,676
Put it up.
Ten to hold. Ten dollar to win.

480
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,904
I got a winner, I gotta pay.
I don't get mad when I lose.

481
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,845
Now watch my red number
and my black number.

482
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:48,610
-Anybody else? Anybody else? Put it here.
-Yeah, right here.

483
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:51,583
I need some information
on a guy called Skip.

484
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:54,318
Twenty-six, maybe 27 years old.

485
00:51:54,494 --> 00:51:56,655
He's a regular at the Cock Pit
and the Anvil.

486
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:57,819
Yeah, Skip Lee?

487
00:51:57,998 --> 00:52:00,592
He works at a steak house
in Penn Station.

488
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:02,462
The Iron Horse.

489
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:04,934
-Got it.
-Hey.

490
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:07,865
Edelson take care
of those two cops for me?

491
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,508
He's working on it.

492
00:52:09,676 --> 00:52:11,405
-Well, I got something else.
-What?

493
00:52:11,578 --> 00:52:14,376
You know that guy
that was killed up at the Ramble?

494
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:18,245
Couple of my friends were up there
that night and they said they heard singing.

495
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:20,750
-Singing?
-Yeah, nursery rhyme, like:

496
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:23,082
Who 's here?
We're here

497
00:52:23,256 --> 00:52:25,417
Something like that.

498
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,703
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

499
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:42,501
-Table for two?
-Yeah.

500
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:44,769
This way, please.

501
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:52,307
There you go.

502
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:54,419
-Okay.
-Thank you.

503
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,817
Enjoy your dinner.

504
00:53:01,828 --> 00:53:03,887
There's our boy.

505
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:07,158
Yes, would you like a drink
before dinner?

506
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:11,132
-Yeah, Heineken.
-Okay.

507
00:53:12,472 --> 00:53:14,303
And what about you, sir?

508
00:53:14,474 --> 00:53:16,374
Something to drink?

509
00:53:17,043 --> 00:53:19,705
-I'll have.... I'll have a steak.
-Okay.

510
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,347
-Make it two.
-Right.

511
00:53:21,514 --> 00:53:23,573
-How would you like those cooked?
-Rare.

512
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,479
Medium.

513
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:32,294
The pattern of lacerations
match the serrations.

514
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:35,625
The depth and the width
of the stab wounds...

515
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:38,393
...could all have been made
with this type blade.

516
00:53:38,568 --> 00:53:41,469
Could you take off an arm
or a leg with that thing?

517
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:44,072
You'd have to be very strong.

518
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:47,836
But yes, it could get the job done.

519
00:53:57,687 --> 00:53:59,587
This is what you're looking for.

520
00:53:59,756 --> 00:54:02,190
Your man's carrying this.

521
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:37,654
Come on, guys, let's get it going.

522
00:54:37,827 --> 00:54:40,455
Another half hour, I'm on overtime.

523
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:43,230
Yeah.

524
00:54:52,275 --> 00:54:54,266
Let's go to work.

525
00:55:09,859 --> 00:55:11,326
Here we go.

526
00:55:15,999 --> 00:55:19,457
-What's that?
-Well, there's two of us here, man.

527
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,538
Are you kidding?

528
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:25,196
That's not my scene.

529
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:28,671
Okay then, then you tie me up.

530
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:32,407
That's too weird, man.

531
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,479
Are you saying you won't do it?

532
00:55:35,652 --> 00:55:39,645
-Well, I just don't get into that.
- Yeah, but I do.

533
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:42,383
What do you want?
You want me to tie you up...

534
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,323
-...and then what do you want me to do?
-Whatever you want.

535
00:55:55,104 --> 00:55:56,093
Let's get out of here.

536
00:56:14,858 --> 00:56:15,847
Who's here?

537
00:56:43,152 --> 00:56:44,983
-Okay.
-And do what?

538
00:56:56,366 --> 00:56:58,231
-What the hell is this?
-Get your ass in.

539
00:56:58,401 --> 00:57:00,062
-Against the wall.
-What' s going on?

540
00:57:00,236 --> 00:57:01,567
-Your hand.
-What's your name?

541
00:57:01,738 --> 00:57:04,366
-I said give me your hand.
-What are you doing here?

542
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,099
-Did he try anything?
-No.

543
00:57:06,276 --> 00:57:07,868
-Did he show you his knife?
-No.

544
00:57:08,177 --> 00:57:10,270
Now, what were you faggots
doing up there?

545
00:57:10,446 --> 00:57:12,004
What is this shit, huh?

546
00:57:12,181 --> 00:57:14,012
You were gonna stick him, weren't you?

547
00:57:14,183 --> 00:57:15,445
What are you talking about?

548
00:57:15,618 --> 00:57:18,553
-Whose room was it?
-His.

549
00:57:20,723 --> 00:57:22,691
Is that right?

550
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,385
I told you, what we were doing
is none of your business.

551
00:57:26,563 --> 00:57:29,930
-So you had no right to come in there.
-I wanna know what you were doing.

552
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:31,396
Nothing.

553
00:57:31,568 --> 00:57:33,365
Nothing?

554
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:36,403
He's tied up lying face down.

555
00:57:36,573 --> 00:57:38,234
Nothing?

556
00:57:38,408 --> 00:57:41,002
Is this what you had in mind for him?

557
00:57:41,911 --> 00:57:44,937
Listen, we got enough to stick you away
for three years right now.

558
00:57:45,114 --> 00:57:49,278
-It's as tight as a chicken's ass.
-Now, you wanna do yourself a favor?

559
00:57:49,452 --> 00:57:50,919
Hey, listen.

560
00:57:51,087 --> 00:57:52,315
This guy cruised me.

561
00:57:52,488 --> 00:57:55,048
I didn't even know him.
I didn't even know his name.

562
00:57:55,224 --> 00:57:56,714
He got me to go up to his room.

563
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:58,952
-That's bullshit.
-Is that right?

564
00:57:59,128 --> 00:58:00,959
I told you it was my room.

565
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,930
That's all I'm gonna tell you.
I wanna see a lawyer.

566
00:58:15,144 --> 00:58:18,875
-What the hell was that?
-Did he show you his knife?

567
00:58:19,048 --> 00:58:21,141
-What'd he hit me for?
-Who paid for the room?

568
00:58:21,985 --> 00:58:24,078
-What was that?
-Who paid for the room?

569
00:58:24,253 --> 00:58:26,346
-What'd he hit me for?
-Who paid for the room?

570
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:29,082
-I told you I did!
-He did, man.

571
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:30,884
Fuck.

572
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,496
All right, let's separate these two girls.

573
00:58:34,897 --> 00:58:36,194
-Come on, get up.
-Let's go.

574
00:58:36,366 --> 00:58:38,197
Come on, get up.

575
00:58:39,836 --> 00:58:42,134
Come on, get in there.

576
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:48,641
You came in too soon, Sonny.

577
00:58:48,811 --> 00:58:50,938
You were too soon.

578
00:58:55,451 --> 00:58:58,887
Hey, you really hit me, man.

579
00:59:01,691 --> 00:59:03,716
You know this man?

580
00:59:05,094 --> 00:59:06,584
No.

581
00:59:06,763 --> 00:59:10,460
What about him, Skip? Recognize him?

582
00:59:11,434 --> 00:59:14,062
Have you ever seen him before?

583
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:20,769
-Him?
-What do you want from me, huh?

584
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:25,169
I never killed nobody.
You better let me see a lawyer, man.

585
00:59:28,184 --> 00:59:29,481
Tremendous.

586
00:59:29,652 --> 00:59:30,778
Oh, Nolan Ryan.

587
00:59:30,953 --> 00:59:33,353
You know he did that
off the two-hitter too?

588
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:38,453
Oh, come on!

589
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:46,067
-Who is that guy?
-Ever see a knife like this, Skip?

590
00:59:46,235 --> 00:59:48,726
I see them every day.
They give them out where I work.

591
00:59:48,905 --> 00:59:50,236
Do you have one like it?

592
00:59:50,406 --> 00:59:52,033
What do you want from me, huh?

593
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:55,006
You're a lying son of a bitch.

594
00:59:58,948 --> 01:00:00,040
Skip...

595
01:00:00,216 --> 01:00:02,844
...the day Martino Perry was killed...

596
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:05,180
...you were seen coming out of his store.

597
01:00:05,354 --> 01:00:08,118
I bought him an ounce of grass.

598
01:00:09,392 --> 01:00:10,654
Get up.

599
01:00:10,827 --> 01:00:13,295
Get on your feet.

600
01:00:16,165 --> 01:00:18,463
Get your pants down.

601
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:20,362
-What?
-Watch my lips.

602
01:00:20,536 --> 01:00:23,403
-Get your pants down.
-Get them off!

603
01:00:24,073 --> 01:00:26,337
You're gonna jerk off, mister.

604
01:00:26,509 --> 01:00:28,568
We're gonna get a sample of your sperm.

605
01:00:28,745 --> 01:00:31,873
Then you're gonna take
the floating-ball test.

606
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:34,140
What's that?

607
01:00:35,218 --> 01:00:37,686
We're gonna fill that sink with water...

608
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:41,517
...then we're gonna dip your balls in it,
and if they don't float...

609
01:00:41,824 --> 01:00:44,190
...you're our main man.

610
01:00:46,129 --> 01:00:48,290
Do you understand that?

611
01:01:02,545 --> 01:01:04,740
The prints don't match.

612
01:01:05,348 --> 01:01:08,511
The print on the quarter's
different than the kid's print.

613
01:01:13,222 --> 01:01:16,157
Listen, boss, let me have this guy.

614
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:18,293
I'm telling you,
I can make him give it up.

615
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:21,862
He's only been working in that steak joint
a little over two months.

616
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:25,595
You got nothing.

617
01:01:25,768 --> 01:01:27,963
He's the wrong guy.

618
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:58,490
-Hi.
-Hello.

619
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:04,201
Why didn't you use your key?

620
01:02:10,046 --> 01:02:11,877
Can I come in?

621
01:02:13,516 --> 01:02:15,677
I'm on my way out.

622
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:18,250
Okay.

623
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:33,927
What's going on?

624
01:02:34,103 --> 01:02:35,968
Nothing.

625
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:38,940
Why can't you trust me?

626
01:02:39,108 --> 01:02:41,838
I don't wanna talk about it, Nance.

627
01:02:42,645 --> 01:02:43,976
Is it me?

628
01:02:44,146 --> 01:02:46,842
-Are you turned off to me?
-No.

629
01:02:49,085 --> 01:02:51,349
Why don't you want me anymore?

630
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:56,918
I'm tired, that's all.

631
01:03:01,264 --> 01:03:02,595
I'm not an idiot.

632
01:03:02,865 --> 01:03:05,993
Nance, what I'm doing is affecting me.

633
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:12,935
I'm on your side, you know?

634
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,905
I don't know, I--

635
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:19,411
I don't understand
what's happening to you.

636
01:03:19,582 --> 01:03:21,607
Neither do I.

637
01:03:25,254 --> 01:03:27,950
Maybe we should cut loose for a while.

638
01:03:30,426 --> 01:03:32,257
Yeah.

639
01:03:39,302 --> 01:03:41,395
Yeah. Okay.

640
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:55,713
Steve.

641
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:02,580
Forget it.

642
01:04:26,415 --> 01:04:29,907
I don't understand how you let
those guys work me over like that.

643
01:04:30,086 --> 01:04:32,850
Welcome to the Detective Division.

644
01:04:33,622 --> 01:04:35,385
We're gonna have to find another way.

645
01:04:35,558 --> 01:04:37,685
I'm not getting paid enough
to go through this.

646
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:41,728
You think I enjoy it? We're looking
for a killer. We gotta make it convincing.

647
01:04:41,897 --> 01:04:43,194
Look, the guy was innocent.

648
01:04:43,366 --> 01:04:46,164
You worked him over
like he shot the president or something.

649
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:49,429
You destroyed that kid.
You didn't even have a case against him.

650
01:04:49,605 --> 01:04:50,594
You fingered him.

651
01:04:50,773 --> 01:04:53,264
I didn't think anybody
was gonna go that far with him.

652
01:04:53,442 --> 01:04:56,070
Sometimes you only get that one chance.

653
01:04:56,245 --> 01:04:57,303
He didn't have a knife.

654
01:04:59,081 --> 01:05:03,950
I didn't come on this job to shitcan
some guy just because he's gay, captain.

655
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,817
You're gonna come into days where
you have to collar a dozen guys like that.

656
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:11,721
Scared, weird little guys who don't know
why they have to do what they do.

657
01:05:11,894 --> 01:05:15,557
It isn't their fault,
it isn't your fault, it's the job.

658
01:05:15,731 --> 01:05:17,858
I can't do the job.

659
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,336
I don't think I can do the job, captain.

660
01:05:28,177 --> 01:05:31,305
I don't think I can handle it, that's all.

661
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,641
I don't know.

662
01:05:33,816 --> 01:05:36,649
It's just.... It's ju--

663
01:05:37,586 --> 01:05:40,077
Things happening to me, you know.

664
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:42,747
I don't know that I can handle it.

665
01:05:42,925 --> 01:05:47,555
I want you to know that it's not
because I'm afraid or anything.

666
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:52,232
It's just stuff going down,
I don't think I can....

667
01:05:52,401 --> 01:05:54,665
I can deal with that.

668
01:05:56,472 --> 01:05:58,497
I need you.

669
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:01,908
You're my partner
and you can't let me down.

670
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:04,670
We're up to our ass in this...

671
01:06:04,847 --> 01:06:07,475
...and I'm counting on you.

672
01:06:19,628 --> 01:06:21,528
Steve.

673
01:06:29,205 --> 01:06:32,072
This is from
the Columbia University yearbook.

674
01:06:32,241 --> 01:06:34,607
These pictures go back two years.

675
01:06:34,777 --> 01:06:36,836
There's a check mark
next to every student...

676
01:06:37,012 --> 01:06:40,812
...who ever took a class from that
Columbia professor who got killed.

677
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:46,244
I'd like you to take this
and see if you can recognize anybody.

678
01:07:52,721 --> 01:07:54,621
Registrar's office. Good morning.

679
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:57,759
Yes, I'm trying to locate a student,
Stuart Richards.

680
01:07:57,927 --> 01:08:00,896
He was-- He' s in the department
of Music and Speech.

681
01:08:01,063 --> 01:08:03,998
Is he enrolled in the summer session?

682
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:06,898
Yes, I believe he is.

683
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:10,402
-Would you wait just a moment, please?
-Yes.

684
01:08:16,712 --> 01:08:17,701
-Hold on.
-Yes.

685
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,144
Well, the last address
I have on Stuart Richards--

686
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:22,477
Hold on just a second, please. Yes?

687
01:08:22,651 --> 01:08:24,278
-It's 140...
-One-forty.

688
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:28,412
-... Claremont Avenue, Morningside Heights.
-Thank you.

689
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:39,257
-I got it.
-There you go.

690
01:09:04,827 --> 01:09:07,022
God, what is this? Sheep shit?

691
01:09:07,196 --> 01:09:09,187
What do you expect
for 50 cents a pack?

692
01:09:09,365 --> 01:09:11,765
I didn't realize things
were getting that rough.

693
01:09:11,934 --> 01:09:15,927
I think my old man's about to draw the line
again. He turned me down on the car.

694
01:09:16,105 --> 01:09:17,094
Oh, yeah?

695
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:20,731
He doesn't understand why I would
want a car to do research in a library...

696
01:09:20,909 --> 01:09:23,673
...that's right across the street
from where I live.

697
01:09:23,846 --> 01:09:26,076
So, what are you gonna do?

698
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:29,515
Live within my meager means...

699
01:09:29,685 --> 01:09:34,645
...and continue my thesis on the roots
of the American musical theater.

700
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:38,886
All in the way of buying two more years
before I have to go out in the world.

701
01:09:39,061 --> 01:09:42,053
I didn't mean your plans for life, Stuie.
What about tonight?

702
01:09:42,231 --> 01:09:44,131
Don't call me Stuie, okay?

703
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,029
Sorry.

704
01:09:46,201 --> 01:09:48,101
I got a lot of stuff
to do tonight, Paul.

705
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:50,170
I have to go out.
I should do more work.

706
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:52,671
Well, if you get tired of studying...

707
01:09:52,841 --> 01:09:55,105
...figure I can get my old man
to adopt you.

708
01:09:55,277 --> 01:09:57,268
You're too kind.

709
01:09:57,446 --> 01:09:59,641
You noticed.

710
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:24,844
Father, I need to talk to you.

711
01:18:29,424 --> 01:18:32,188
I wish just once you'd say
something positive to me.

712
01:18:34,062 --> 01:18:36,963
I tried to do everything you wanted
but it's never good enough.

713
01:18:37,132 --> 01:18:40,898
I've taken it for granted
that you understood, Stuie.

714
01:18:44,573 --> 01:18:46,973
You know what you have to do.

715
01:18:49,811 --> 01:18:53,008
You know what you have to do.

716
01:20:08,089 --> 01:20:10,557
-Yes?
-I'm looking for Ted.

717
01:20:10,725 --> 01:20:14,684
-I live-- I got the room next door.
-You must be the famous John Forbes.

718
01:20:14,863 --> 01:20:18,492
-You must be Greg.
-Yeah, it looks as if I got back just in time.

719
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:19,656
What do you mean?

720
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:22,928
Do you usually come barging in
on Ted at dinnertime?

721
01:20:23,104 --> 01:20:25,368
I don't know whether
that's any of your business.

722
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:28,703
Wrong. It's exactly my business.

723
01:20:28,977 --> 01:20:31,309
Anyway, you struck out tonight.
Ted isn't here.

724
01:20:32,013 --> 01:20:33,844
Where is he?

725
01:20:34,749 --> 01:20:39,709
If you must know, he's out working
an IBM machine in a primo brokerage house.

726
01:20:39,888 --> 01:20:42,789
Pays well because normal folk
don't like working at night.

727
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:43,947
It's good for him.

728
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:47,822
When he's out working he's not out
getting involved, if you know what I mean.

729
01:20:48,496 --> 01:20:50,930
No, I don't know what you mean.

730
01:20:51,933 --> 01:20:53,230
-No?
-No.

731
01:20:53,401 --> 01:20:55,631
Ted is too sensitive
to have many involvements.

732
01:20:55,804 --> 01:20:58,671
We found that out with the last
piece of trash that moved in.

733
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:03,675
It must be something about that room,
the people it attracts, do you suppose?

734
01:21:05,947 --> 01:21:07,938
You bastard.

735
01:21:08,116 --> 01:21:09,845
Pussy.

736
01:21:11,219 --> 01:21:12,948
Come on, you cocksucker!

737
01:21:13,121 --> 01:21:16,420
Just do it again
and I'll call the police, asshole.

738
01:21:23,999 --> 01:21:25,591
Fuck.

739
01:21:27,902 --> 01:21:29,836
Oh, shit.

740
01:21:53,728 --> 01:21:54,717
Motherfucker.

741
01:21:54,896 --> 01:21:58,696
You ain't normal.
You are shit. Dog shit.

742
01:22:05,874 --> 01:22:09,071
You're crazy, mister.
You ought to be committed.

743
01:22:09,244 --> 01:22:11,906
You wanna play, I'll play with you.

744
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:26,789
Get out.

745
01:26:17,158 --> 01:26:19,058
Got a light?

746
01:26:36,277 --> 01:26:38,108
Thanks.

747
01:27:26,928 --> 01:27:28,987
Who 's here?
I'm here

748
01:27:29,163 --> 01:27:30,687
You're here

749
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:40,874
You're very funny.

750
01:27:42,977 --> 01:27:44,706
You got a place?

751
01:27:45,646 --> 01:27:48,240
Yeah, I have a place.

752
01:27:51,319 --> 01:27:54,015
But it's not available right now.

753
01:27:54,956 --> 01:27:57,322
-We could go to my place.
-Yeah, where is that?

754
01:27:57,492 --> 01:28:00,256
-West Village.
-Too far. How about...

755
01:28:00,428 --> 01:28:02,623
...right down there in the tunnel?

756
01:28:06,401 --> 01:28:09,461
I'm not too crazy about public places.

757
01:28:09,837 --> 01:28:12,965
Don't worry, Dorothy,
there's nobody around.

758
01:28:48,009 --> 01:28:50,375
-How big are you?
-Party size.

759
01:28:50,545 --> 01:28:51,910
What are you into?

760
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:54,206
I go anywhere.

761
01:28:54,682 --> 01:28:56,240
I don't do anything.

762
01:28:56,417 --> 01:28:57,509
That's cool.

763
01:28:57,685 --> 01:28:59,778
Hips or lips?

764
01:29:19,507 --> 01:29:21,441
Bashful?

765
01:29:22,777 --> 01:29:23,971
No.

766
01:29:24,779 --> 01:29:26,679
Then get them down.

767
01:29:26,848 --> 01:29:28,839
I wanna see the world.

768
01:29:31,452 --> 01:29:33,443
Go for it.

769
01:30:19,867 --> 01:30:23,496
Stuart, the man you attacked
the other night was a police officer.

770
01:30:26,507 --> 01:30:28,372
He attacked me.

771
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:31,173
We know you killed Martino Perry.

772
01:30:31,345 --> 01:30:35,304
Your fingerprint was on the quarter.
We're going to indict on that.

773
01:30:35,483 --> 01:30:38,509
The upside for you is 20 to life.

774
01:30:40,354 --> 01:30:43,619
That's all you're gonna get
is an indictment.

775
01:30:51,265 --> 01:30:54,257
If you confess to the murder
of Martino Perry...

776
01:30:54,435 --> 01:30:57,268
...and Loren Lukas and Eric Rossman...

777
01:30:57,438 --> 01:31:00,430
...and four or five others
we think you're involved in...

778
01:31:00,608 --> 01:31:02,940
...we'll reduce your sentence.

779
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,374
You'll do eight years, no more.

780
01:31:07,048 --> 01:31:11,041
I've talked to the DA,
and he's willing to go along.

781
01:31:14,155 --> 01:31:17,056
I never killed anyone.

782
01:31:23,764 --> 01:31:25,994
You'll have to run it down
for the grand jury.

783
01:31:26,167 --> 01:31:28,863
-Grand jury?
-Just a formality.

784
01:31:29,036 --> 01:31:32,767
Once you've been cleared,
you can never be sued or face any charges.

785
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:35,909
We'll present the evidence,
tell them what your assignment was...

786
01:31:36,077 --> 01:31:38,739
...they'll go for necessary force,
and you'll walk away.

787
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:44,875
You know, captain...

788
01:31:45,286 --> 01:31:48,084
...I appreciate the chance you gave me.

789
01:31:48,255 --> 01:31:51,452
You were there for me. I-- I--

790
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:53,650
I appreciate it.

791
01:31:53,828 --> 01:31:56,160
Your orders should come down
after the grand jury.

792
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:58,992
Meanwhile, take the rest
of the week off.

793
01:32:04,505 --> 01:32:06,439
Burns...

794
01:32:07,274 --> 01:32:10,038
...welcome to the Detective Division.

795
01:32:10,211 --> 01:32:12,111
Thanks...

796
01:32:14,148 --> 01:32:17,413
-...Captain Edelman.
-Edelstein.

797
01:32:21,856 --> 01:32:22,845
Hey, down here.

798
01:32:25,292 --> 01:32:28,022
Do you know
any of these people, Mr. Gaines?

799
01:32:29,497 --> 01:32:32,864
They look like pictures of Stuart
when he was a kid.

800
01:32:33,034 --> 01:32:35,525
I got a box of old letters here.

801
01:32:35,703 --> 01:32:38,103
All addressed to...

802
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,739
...the same guy.

803
01:32:39,907 --> 01:32:42,432
John L. Richards, St. Louis.

804
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:45,670
-That was his father.
-I wonder why he never sent these.

805
01:32:45,846 --> 01:32:47,837
He's been dead for 10 years.

806
01:32:48,015 --> 01:32:49,915
Oh, yeah?

807
01:32:50,084 --> 01:32:54,214
I guess he never got over it.
He used to talk about him like he was alive.

808
01:33:16,343 --> 01:33:19,312
Are you Miss Ella?
Right in there, captain.

809
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,439
-What time did you hear voices?
-About 2:15, 2:30.

810
01:33:23,617 --> 01:33:25,812
Did you hear anything they were saying?

811
01:33:27,254 --> 01:33:28,915
Captain.

812
01:33:30,091 --> 01:33:33,060
The landlady discovered the body
about 2:30 a.m.

813
01:33:33,227 --> 01:33:35,058
The guy downstairs
heard some screaming.

814
01:33:35,229 --> 01:33:38,164
He's giving the details
to Patrolman Desher outside.

815
01:33:38,799 --> 01:33:40,096
Who is he?

816
01:33:40,267 --> 01:33:44,431
Name is Ted Bailey. Works in a brokerage
house downtown part-time, nights.

817
01:33:44,605 --> 01:33:46,664
Went to the beach today
with three friends.

818
01:33:47,575 --> 01:33:50,703
Got back about 6, went to work.

819
01:33:50,911 --> 01:33:52,970
He must have got hit
just after he came home.

820
01:33:53,147 --> 01:33:55,809
There's no sign of a struggle,
nothing seems to be stolen.

821
01:33:55,983 --> 01:33:57,541
Must have been someone he knew.

822
01:33:57,718 --> 01:34:00,653
I think we got the murder weapon in there.
It's a kitchen knife.

823
01:34:00,821 --> 01:34:04,257
He had a roommate by the name
of Gregory Milanese.

824
01:34:04,425 --> 01:34:06,791
He's a dancer.
We got an alarm out for him.

825
01:34:06,961 --> 01:34:09,395
Looks like a lover's quarrel to me.

826
01:34:10,331 --> 01:34:13,164
-DiSimone.
-Sir?

827
01:34:13,334 --> 01:34:14,733
Sixth Precinct.

828
01:34:14,902 --> 01:34:16,767
Yes, sir.

829
01:34:20,941 --> 01:34:22,875
Who lives in that apartment
down the hall?

830
01:34:23,043 --> 01:34:26,069
A guy called Casey,
but he's away for the summer.

831
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,244
The one next door is registered
in the name of John Forbes.

832
01:34:29,416 --> 01:34:32,544
The landlady thinks it's phony.
She ain't seen him in a couple days.

833
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,948
What's that name?

834
01:34:34,121 --> 01:34:36,316
John Forbes.

835
01:34:55,609 --> 01:34:57,406
Jesus Christ.

836
01:34:57,912 --> 01:34:59,675
Sir?

837
01:35:43,324 --> 01:35:44,791
When'd you get in?

838
01:35:44,959 --> 01:35:46,324
A little while ago.

839
01:35:46,493 --> 01:35:48,427
I'm back.

840
01:35:48,696 --> 01:35:50,630
Can I stay?

841
01:35:50,998 --> 01:35:52,966
Sure.

842
01:35:53,634 --> 01:35:55,397
I'm glad.

843
01:35:55,569 --> 01:35:57,434
I need to talk to you.

844
01:35:57,605 --> 01:35:59,004
I wanna tell you everything.

845
01:35:59,173 --> 01:36:01,300
Okay? Let me just get this off.

846
01:36:01,475 --> 01:36:03,272
Okay.

847
01:41:52,192 --> 01:41:54,183
