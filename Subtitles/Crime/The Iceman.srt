You two?

347
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,406
Oh, we met on a boat.
Really?

348
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,642
Yeah. Like, big yacht, one
of those big fancy boats?

349
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,961
<i>The one you can ea! and
drink anything you want on?</i>

350
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,929
<i>So I'm in the bath
and I hear this voice</i>

351
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,048
from this other
stall, right?

352
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,089
A little mousy voice.
Oh.

353
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,322
And it goes, "Excuse me?"

354
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,650
"Excuse me? ls there somebody in
the other stall?" I was locked in.

355
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,200
Yeah, right. If you ask me, she
followed somebody in there.

356
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,442
There was a huge line
for the girls room.

357
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,284
How'd you meet Ritchie?

358
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,250
Uh, it, it doesn't compare
to the bathroom story.

359
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,926
I think it's pretty good.
Yeah?

360
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,729
<i>(Dino) Yeah, tell us. Come on.</i>

361
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,249
All right. Uh, I was
working across the street

362
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,291
and, uh, Ritchie would come
over every break he had

363
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,482
and he would bring me
flowers and candy.

364
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,164
And then it got
really awkward,

365
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,363
because I didn't
know who he was.

366
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,843
<i>And I started just making any
excuse I could to say no</i>

367
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,686
and then one day, out
of the blue he walks in

368
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,331
and he tells me
I'm making a big mistake.

369
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,408
And I didn't know
what to say,

370
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,405
because he seemed
so convinced.

371
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,484
So I went
out with him.

372
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,847
All because he wouldn't
leave you alone?

373
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,684
No.

374
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,367
Because, he knew what
I needed more than I did.

375
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,649
And now look at him.

376
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,883
He goes from dubbing cartoons
to international banking.

377
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,325
<i>[Dino laughs]</i>

378
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,243

379

Cartoons? Is that what you
call porn these days? Porn?

380

<i>(Dino) You're going to have
to excuse Terry as an idiot.</i>

381
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,083
When me and Ritchie
weren't looking

382
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,925
he was using the equipment
to make porn for Adele here.

383
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,048
I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

384

<i>I mean, a lift/e porn is
healthy now and then.</i>

386
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,649
Hey, look at these.
These are our girls.

387
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,489
<i>(Dino) Ah, look how
much they've grown.</i>

388
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,530
That's, um, Anabel,
and that's Betsy.

389
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880

Now, Ritchie...

390

Oh, they're gorgeous.
Yeah.

391
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,682
What's currency exchange?

392
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,243
That's when he watches the
market, like everybody else,

393
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,727
<i>and he looks for trends.
(Dino) Okay.</i>

394
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,565
Like, um, natural
disaster or typhus,

395
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,166
then he takes
advantage of inflation.

396
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,686
And waits.
Is that right?

397
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,762
That's pretty good.
Pretty good.

No. Vendor makes

Absolutely not.

Forgot already?

You couldn't even talk to a girl
unless I made the first move.

That's true. So I just think
about you all the time.

I'm all right.

866
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,447
That's it?

867
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,366
The condo prices
in AC skyrocketed.

868
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,205
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

869
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,204
I just lost my temper.
So, what?

870
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,207
Yeah. Yeah. That's been
happening a lot lately.

871
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,169
The guy told you
to go fuck yourself.

872
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,605
You think I'm going
to take that?

873
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,682
So you put
everyone at risk?

874
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,843
That's--

875
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,161
that's not what
I meant to do.

876
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,567
I said, "I'm sorry."

877
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,404
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

878
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,691
Ritchie, you-you-you got
to just talk to me.

879
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,364
Got to tell me.

880
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,048
You and me, we've
been through enough.

881
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,202
We got too much
good here

882
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,851
for you to be acting
this way.

883
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,611
What way? Like you
don't care anymore.

884
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,408
So that's what you think?
I don't care anymore?

885
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,529
<i>I see. I don't get
the benefit of the doubt?</i>

886
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,489
Really?
Of course, you do.

887
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,801
I buy you all this shit,
I buy you this fucking house?

888
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,450
I buy you
your fucking jewelry.

889

to private school!

890

Do not raise your voice
to me, Richard.

891
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,643
"Richard?" What happened to
"Ritchie?" I don't know.

892
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,688
Yeah? Well, fuck you!

893

Yeah.

Well, here's
my situation.

I'm currently unemployable.

954
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,404
Except maybe by the
rat who turned me in.

955
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,725
Look, Polack,
I'm good at my job.

956
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,131
Just because
you fucked up

957
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,531
doesn't mean
I owe you shit.

958
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,329
I'll make it
worth your while.

959
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,165
You take care of the
details, I do the hit.

960
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,564
No risk.
We split it 50-50.

961
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,529
You trying to be
my partner?

962
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,924
No. This is short term.

00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,766
Roy's got to think
I'm retired.

964

You're Polish,
I'm Dutch Irish.

We're not exactly

We might as well look out

Indeed. Your table.

985
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,971
and there was a lot of
money in that pocket.

986

I sold high
on 300,000 francs.

Yeah, I guess.

to come after my family.

Nah.

something with some guy.

Next thing you know,
he's fucking dead.

I'm curious, you know,
how's this thing work?

You put the stuff in a mist.

You spray it in someone's
face, they fall asleep.

take some time to get that shit.

are we talking?

I've been supplying him with
coke for about couple years now.

1455
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,762
He wants me to get him two Ks.

1456
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,890
All this cyanide talk and
everything, it's got me thinking.

1457

Thinking what?

1458
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,362
We could kill two birds
here with one stone.

a good idea.

could take care of the cyanide

1462

He's got markers all over the
fucking place, you know?

1466
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:12,647
Besides, he holds a grudge. He's liable
to blackmail me and bail him out.

You do me this favor
