and we'll talk to them,

and you don't wanna do it after that,
I won't argue with you.

This is Patrick Kenzie,

- Hi.
- I remember you from high school.

179
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,388
I see you're still a little conceited, huh?

LIONEL: Would you excuse us, Dottie?

181
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:32,023
Dottie's my best friend, Lionel.
She could be in my house if she wants.

Helene, we don't wanna
get in your hair.

We're just gonna ask you
a couple questions

184
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,397
about your daughter,
then we'll be out of here.

185

- Everyone wants their part now.
- I know.

- Listen, we're not the cops.

189

and see if we could help out
finding your daughter.

It's my kid.

the goddamn courtesy

- and respect they deserve!
- She's in grieving, prick.

in the hallway, please?

Excuse us, Helene.

- She's a cunt!

She got a lot of people
come by the house?

I don't know.
She's at the Fillmore all the time.

222

She's at the Fillmore Lounge?

Yeah, she drinks every day.

I think she does a little coke.

I mean, how much is a lot?

00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,798
Few times a week's a lot.

230

It was not.

it would help find her niece.

we could help

- He just looks young.

for where she might be

00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,048

you understand?

Half of all the children in these cases
are killed, flat out.

This is day three.

259
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,065
He may look young,

260
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,228
but if he wants to work this case,
he'd better not act it.

261
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,967
Well, he's been hired by a woman
who's the victim of a crime,

262
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,339
and by law he's entitled
as her representative

263
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,402
to be cooperated with
by the Boston Police Department.

264
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,037
So he expects to be.

265
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,242
And he will be.

266
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,822
He and his better half will be contacted
by two of my senior men,

267
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:03,658
at their convenience,
and be permitted to observe.

neighbor's house for a half hour."

- 8:00.

- Are you sure it was the same night?
- Fucking positive,

'cause she was in the shitter,
fucking banging down rails with Ray,

314

and I was banging on the fucking door.

- Who, Ray? Skinny Ray?
- Yeah. Ray Likanski.

He's in there ducking me
like a fucking faggot.

317

I was banging on the door.

318
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,804
He thought I didn't know
he was in there,

319
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,473
but I know he's fucking in there.

320

- Hey, Stevie.

- Nothing. What's up, Lenny?

- What's the problem, guy?

You said you weren't a cop.
Right, "guy"?

- Yeah, I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, then why don't you fuck off?

and be a smartass?

about people's asses there, Dave.

00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,615
I'm not the fucking one.

336
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,589
- All right, just cool it.
- LENNY: Cool it.

337
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,525
- Listen to this douchebag.
- Bet she fucks this asshole in half.

is the matter with you guys?

339
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,128
You, you punk fucking jackass.

340
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,169
We're leaving, all right?

341
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,316
You know, Dave,
I think it's your good looks...

342
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,649
'Cause there is some fine pussy
in here tonight.

343
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,563
Open that door, rummy.

344
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,565
- Open the door, Mike.
- Now.

345
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,941
You ever wanna get fucked,
let me know.

346
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,385
How's that, motherfucker?
Now you know.

347
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,427
Keep your fucking mouths closed.

What, you wanna
say some shit, Fat Dave?

349
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,454
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

350
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,795
Make me a martini,
you fucking fat bastard!

351
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:35,890
- Make it!
- Get the fuck out.

352
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,233
Make me a fucking martini,
you fat fucking retard!

353
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,497
Fucking unbelievable.

00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,755
- Should we... Sit down?
- Something wrong?

00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,447
No! I just...

362
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,460
I think Nick was expecting
an older couple, maybe.

00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,028

Serial molester, recently work-released.

365
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,265
Went AWOL around the time
Amanda disappeared.

366
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,702
Known associates, Leon Trett

367
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,974
and his handsome wife, Roberta.

(PATRICK EXCLAIMS)

369
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,645
The Tretts were released six
and eight months ago, respectively.

370
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,875
They have drug habits.

371
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,713
We don't know where they are,
but we think Corwin's with them.

372
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:04,381
Jailhouse snitch claims
that Corwin confided in him

373
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,119
and told him when he got out,
he was gonna move in with his family.

374
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,887
Apparently the three of them

375
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,930
have some kind of
Addams Family deal going on.

376
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,365
Corwin's plan is to keep a kid
in the house to have sex with.

377
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,871
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Not for Amanda, it doesn't.

378
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,235
ANGIE: Do you think
this is who has Amanda?

379
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,739
Well, there's a lot
of holes in our theory.

380
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,003
I mean, Corwin likes
little boys, you know?

381
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,944
He likes them seven or eight or nine.

382
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,282
So that's it, that's all we got,
there's no other leads, three days in?

383
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,410
No, we got more.

384
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,046
We got six psychics telling us to look
in six different states,

385
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,817
we got Lionel and Bea
with airtight alibis,

386
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,551
we've interviewed every neighbor
in a mile radius

387
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,354
and we got a convicted finger-blaster

388
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,122
who just happened
to cut off his ankle bracelet.

389
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,254
- Take it easy...
- No, no, no, no, no!

390
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,321
Who the fuck is this guy?

391
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,965
You're here because Jack Doyle
had us extend you a courtesy.

392
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,765
You got something to contribute,
you know, be my guest.

393
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,237
Otherwise, hey, you...

394
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,639
You know, you can go back
to your Harry Potter book.

395
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,603
Isn't it usually somebody
who knows the victim?

396
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,978
I think there's plenty of people
in Helene McCready's life

397
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,348
that are capable of doing this.

398
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,021
So then you probably
talked to Ray Likanski.

399
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,284
- Who?
- Ray Likanski.

400
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,852
"Skinny Ray," they call him, 6'2",
about 160 pounds.

401
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,365
Does blow. Helene's boyfriend. No?

402
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,601
- Never heard of him.
- Well, with all due respect,

403
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,830
I think we might be able
to contribute on that point.

404
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,499
- Really? How's that?
- The night Amanda went missing,

405
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,098
Skinny Ray was down
at the Fillmore Lounge

406
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,440
doing coke for two hours,
between 8:00 and 10:00.

407
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,877
Fascinating.

408
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,116
- With Helene McCready.
- You're shitting me.

409
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,150
She did bullshit us.

410
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,485
I'm gonna have to tear her
a new asshole.

411
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,115
Meet you down there.

412
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,388
So what kinda name is Bressant?

413
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,626
It's the kind they give you in Louisiana.

414
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,292
Oh, yeah?
Thought you were from here.

415
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,202
Well, it all depends
on how you look at it.

416
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,607
I mean, you might think that you're
more from here than me, for example.

417
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,807
But I been living here
longer than you been alive.

- Bubba.

422
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,417
- Good to see you, brother.
- Good to see you.

423
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,978
- How you been? You been good?
- Yeah.

424
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,422
Yeah? What's up, Angie?
How you doing, baby?

425
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,321
You seen those people?

426
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:28,155

Pedophile.

427
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,259
What the fuck makes you think
I know people like this?

00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,134
Bub, I know you don't pay your rent
doing people's taxes.

429
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,071
Yeah, I don't pay my rent
selling penny rocks

00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,733
to walleyed child molesters, neither.

431
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,800
They're not all three child molesters.

432
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,239
Just... Just this one, Corwin Earle.

433
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,648
The other two are just baseheads
he hangs out with.

434
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,376
What are the two of yas,
crime dogs, now?

435
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,047
We got hired to find that little girl.

436
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,987
Turns out the mother was down
at the Fillmore all night

437
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,047
while the kid was taken.

438
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,889
- With Skinny Ray.
- Skinny Ray is a fucking bitch.

439
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,658
- I thought Ray was your boy.
- Work for me?

440
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,732
Skinny Ray, he's a fucking cokehead.
He works for the Haitian.

441
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,063
Ray works for Cheese?

Yeah, Cheese, Ray, Chris Mullen,
whole trash-picker crew.

00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,477
There's reasons why
there ain't three inches of Plexiglas

445
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,273
between us right now.

446
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,541
That's 'cause I don't fuck
with skeezers like Helene.

447
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,139
Or coconuts like Cheese.

448
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,240
You should know better by now.

00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,717
I'm the king of this
motherfucking jungle.

450
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,380
I'll let you know
if I hear anything, though.

451
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,650
- Thanks, bro.
- Peace.

- Come on, sweetheart.

455
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,265
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

456
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,129
Oh, sounds familiar.

457
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:46,871
No. No.
It don't "sound familiar," Helene.

458
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:53,316
He's a violent, sociopathic
Haitian criminal named "Cheese."

459
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,153
Either you know him or you don't.

460

Helene, who is he?

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,495
- He's just a guy, Lionel.
- REMY: Thank you.

Mrs. McCready, a drug dealer, yes.

- What other things?
- I don't know.

466

your brother's questions, Helene?

467
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,665
Why don't you go
suck a nigger's dick, Bea?

468
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,040
You listen to me!
You don't disrespect my wife,

469
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,874
and you don't make racial remarks
in my kitchen.

470
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,312
- Who is this man?
- It's my kitchen, Lionel.

471
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,439
You know what I mean!

472
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,245
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

473
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,219
He's a drug dealer, a pimp,
a pornographer. All right?

474
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,777
LIONEL: Perfect.
You associate with a pimp.

475
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,618

Pokey Jackson in a carpet

477
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,654
and shot him in the head
on Castlegate, so there's that, too.

478
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,629
REMY: What do you do for him?

479
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,765
I just mule.

480

Occasionally, not making
a habit out of it.

481
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,399
BEA: Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Lionel, what does that mean?

482
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:50,464
It means she's a drug runner, Bea.
It means she carries drugs.

483
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,976
- Isn't that right, Helene?
- Oh, my God, a few times.

484
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,104
- Where?
- Providence...

485
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,876
Does it fucking matter?

486
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,143
You think I'm fucking around, here?

487
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,653
You think I'm playing games, here?
'Course it matters.

488
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,593
LIONEL: Better answer
his question, Helene.

489
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,151
- For what?
- Fuck's sake, Lionel.

490
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,858
- What do you think? Money, taste.
- Of what, drugs?

491
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,867
No, little puffy heart stickers
for my locker.

492
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,869
BEA: What kind of drugs?
NICK: Cocaine and heroin.

493
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:23,738
- No, I would've seen the track marks.
- Not if you snort it. Right, sugar?

494
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,208
Yeah, less addictive that way.

495
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,308
Piece of work.

496
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,746
What the fuck is that?
Where are you going?

497
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,989
Oh, yeah.
I keep thinking about this thing I heard.

498
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,897
- You know where I'm going with this?
- No.

499

00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,145
Get back in the car.

665
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,988
Guys, you two go in there
and negotiate a ransom for a little girl,

666
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,461
then it is the FBI.
'Cause it's kidnapping.

667
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,690
ANGIE: All you're gonna do
is scare him.

668
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,495
The more you scare him,
the worse it is for her.

669
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,130
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

670
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,002
All right. Go ahead.

671
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:01,775
Just fucking relax, sit tight. I know him.
I'm gonna take care of it.

672
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,313
Good luck.

673
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,449
It's been a long time.

674
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,720
No. I quit.

675
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,201
I'm gonna talk some private shit.

676
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:32,334
- Don't wait, but don't get too far.
- You know I'll be right here.

677
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,778
Bitches love the cheddar.

678
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,781
- How you been, Chris?
- Better than you.

679
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,284
Yeah. Good to hear it.

680
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,455
- Fuck you.
- Man, be cool.

681
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,433
It's been too long not to see a fool.

682
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,492
I grant you audience.

683
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,627
Go.

684
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,268
We found what you
were looking for in Chelsea.

685
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,445
What I care about Chelsea?

686
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,710
'Cause one of the idiots
that robbed you lived there.

687
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,717
What idiot?

688
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,846
The one that you and Chris
beat with a pipe and shot in the chest.

689
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:24,022
I don't know about nobody getting kill.

690
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,759
But if somebody rob me
and end up dead...

691
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,960
Well, you know, life is a motherfucker.

692
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:39,671
Cheese, we got your money.
It was buried in Ray's backyard.

693
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:44,604
We wanna give it back to you
in exchange for Amanda McCready.

694
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:48,047
The two police outside
are the only other people who know.

695
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,553
No one gives a fuck
about what you did.

696
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,782
I mean, I didn't even
like Ray that much.

697
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,621
You're gonna get your money,
the mother gets her daughter back,

698
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,661
and we'll say we found the kid
in the bushes, or whatever.

699
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,786
(SCOFFS)

700
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,831
It's either this, real quiet,

701
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,128
or it's a thousand fucking cops
kicking your door in,

702
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,691
putting their fat knees in your neck.

703
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,435
Hold up.

704
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,836
Whoa. Whoa.

705
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,740
What the fuck is this?

706
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,641
Lift up your shirt.

707
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,550
- Come on, man.
- Motherfucker, you heard me.

708
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,018
Lift up your shirt.

709
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:31,619
- It ain't like that, Cheese.
- My CC, I ain't down with you.

710
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,692
Lift up your shirt.

711
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,623
(SIGHING)

712
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,528
You, too, baby.
Ain't no gender immunity.

713
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,095
Let me see some tit.

714
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,041
Don't ever come in my spot like that.

715
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,639
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

716
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,979
You got my money,

717
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:00,854
you leave that shit in the mailbox
on your ass way out, you feel me?

718
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,858
Some other motherfuckers
let fool rob on them.

719
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,157
I don't play scrimmage.

720
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,459
But I don't fuck with no kids.

721
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:16,206
And if that girl only hope is you,
well, I pray for her,

722
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,138
'cause she's gone, baby.

723
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,436
Gone.

724
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,914
Cheese, if you ever
disrespect her again like that,

725
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,584
I'm gonna pull your fucking card.

726
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,785
Okay?

727
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,294
So you're saying you didn't do it, fine.

728
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,429
We'll take your money,
and we'll be on our way.

729
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,398
But if it turns out you're lying,

730
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,137
I'm going to spend every nickel
of that money to fuck you up.

731
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,906
I'm gonna bribe cops to go after you,

732
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,448
I'm gonna pay guys
to go after your weak fucking crew,

733
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,610
and I'm gonna tell everyone I know
that you're a CI and a rat.

734
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,778
And I know a lot of people.

735
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:06,548
And after that, you're gonna wish
you had listened to me,

736
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,388
'cause your shitty, pool-hall,
crime-syndicate headquarters

737
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,825
is gonna get raided.

738
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,420
And your doped-up bitches
are gonna get sent back to Laos,

739
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,931
and this fucking retard right here
is gonna be testifying against you

740
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,400
for a reduced sentence while you're
getting cornholed in your cell

741

by a gang of crackers.

742
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,273
'Cause from what I heard,

you guys that get sent up Concord
for killing kids,

I'm gonna get discourteous on you.

746

And get that sausage off my lawn.

747
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,473
- NICK: Well, what happened?
- He said he didn't know anything,

748
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,310
but if you had his money,
you could put it in his mailbox.

749
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,283
- That's what he told you?
- That's it.

750
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,343
Nothing else?

751
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,788
Yeah. He said that he wanted
you two off his lawn.

753
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,092
I thought you said
you knew this fucking guy.

Half the guys he knows
are degenerates.

755

Yeah, you know
what the other half are?

756
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:24,191
- What?
- Cops. Don't hold it against me.

757
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:29,171
No, no. I won't hold it against you.

758
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,042
You know what I'll hold against you?

759
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,604
We had one chance to make this deal.
You said you knew him.

760
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,673
You said you could do it
and you fucked it up.

761
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,718
Now I gotta get a warrant for a tap,
start surveillance,

dies because of this,

765
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,758
I won't have to hold it against you.

766
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,499
You'll hold it against yourself
for a long, long time.

768
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,257

770
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,969
- Yeah.
- Cheese called in.

771
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,874
Says he'll take the deal with Amanda,
but he wants to go tonight.

772
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,571
- Great.
- Well, it is and it isn't.

773
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,342
They record calls at the station now.

774
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,976
- Jack got a hold of the transcript.
- What does that mean?

775
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:51,112
It means our badges are
basically fucking forfeit at this point.

776
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,053
He wants you both down here, now.

777
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,250
Oh, and, hey, Cheese said
he left something in a mailbox

778
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,691
to prove that he's got Amanda.

779
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:23,210
This is a transcript of a recorded call
that came in this morning.

780
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,584
Care to read the highlighted portion?

781
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,059

782
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,495
Uh.

you better have my money.

"Fuck around for a minute
and I'll throw that girl in the lake."

789

The lake he refers to is the water
in the abandoned quarry.

an unauthorized ransom arrangement

to exchange Amanda McCready
for $ 130,000 tonight

in just that location.

793

After some discussion,
Detective Bressant was kind enough

794
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,135
to produce this.

795
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,369
Recognize it?

796
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,538
The four of you have involved me
in an illegal activity

797
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,106
without my knowledge or consent,
and I don't fucking appreciate it.

798
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,676
- You don't have to be a part of it, sir.
- The hell I don't.

799
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,483
If I delay this now, after this agreement,

800
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,252
I just further endanger
the life of that child.

801
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:38,192
Does that sound like something
you expect me to do?

802
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,593
No, sir.

803
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,091
I went in there. I'll accept responsibility.

804
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,031
You'll accept nothing!

805
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,826
Don't come in here
trying to get noble, boy.

806
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,803
Let me see that note.

807
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,175
My God.

REMY: He wants to separate us.

809
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,184
The note instructs you guys to be
on the east side and wait for Amanda,

810
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,590
me and Nick to be at the clearing
by the edge with the money.

811
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,459
Once Amanda's turned over to you,
you give us a call on the radio,

812
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,327
we turn over the cash.

813
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,565
- Who's he likely to bring with him?
- Chris Mullen.

814
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,763
He was at the club
when we made the offer.

815
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,466
What do you know about him?

816
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,475
It was probably him
who killed Ray for Cheese.

817
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:27,737
If I had to guess.

818
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,575
All right.
Nobody else knows about this, right?

819
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,081
- I don't know.
- Yes?

820
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,246
I'm asking if keeping it quiet is better
for Amanda or is it better for us?

821
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,615
Do you have any children,
Miss Gennaro?

822
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,250
No, sir.

823
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:49,255
My only child was murdered.
She was 12. Did you hear about it?

824
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,296
What you probably didn't hear,

825
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,597
and what I hope
you never have to deal with,

826
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,106
Miss Gennaro, is what that feels like.
What I have to deal with.

827
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:01,706
Knowing that my little girl likely died

828
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,406
crying out for me
to come and save her.

829
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,976
And I never did.

830
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:13,987
My little girl died afraid and alone
in a shallow ditch bank

831
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,618
by the side of the road

01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,706

1009

Just give us the fucking wizza!

1010

No, it's not a party.

1015
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,471
How much money's there, Patrick?

1016
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,066
Enough.

1017
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:58,903

1018
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:11,454

1019

- Well, they're definitely high.

We were paying $ 100
an eight-ball to snitches.

1080
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,740
We got a call
from our pal, Ray Likanski.

1081
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:20,077
He couldn't find enough guys to rat out.

1082
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:22,242
Anyway, he tells us there's a guy
pumping up in an apartment

1083
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,445
up in Columbia Point.

1084
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,346
We go in, me and Nicky.

1085
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:31,723
Fifteen years ago, when Nicky went in,
it was no joke.

1086
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:33,857
So, it's a... It's a stash house, right?

1087
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:37,831
The old lady's beat to shit,
the husband's mean, cracked out,

1088
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,597
tries to give us trouble,
Nicky lays him down.

1089
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,661
We're doing an inventory,
but it looks like we messed up

1090
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:47,072
because there's no dope in the house,
and I go in the back room...

1091
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:50,669
Now, this place
was a shithole, mind you.

1092
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,375
Rats, roaches all over the place.

1093
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,613
But the kid's room, in the back,

1094
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,582
was spotless.

1095
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:05,617
No, I mean, he swept it, mopped it,
it was immaculate.

1096
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:08,558
The little boy's sitting on the bed

1097
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,089
holding onto his PlayStation
for dear life.

1098
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,692
There's no expression on his face,

1099
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,468

1100
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:23,677
He wants to tell me he just learned
his multiplication tables.

Christ.

1102
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,574
I mean, the father's got him
in this crack den,

1103
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,346
subsisting on Twinkies
and ass-whippings,

1104
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:36,051
and this little boy just wants someone
to tell him that he's doing a good job.

1105
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,527
You're worried what's Catholic?

1106
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,723
I mean, kids forgive.

1107
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,965
Kids don't judge.

What do they get for it?

1110
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,606
So I went back out there,

1111
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,770
I put an ounce of heroin
on the living room floor,

1112
01:11:56,845 --> 01:12:00,212
and I sent the father on a ride,
seven to nine.

1113
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:06,421
- That was the right thing?
- Fucking A!

1114
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,884
You gotta take a side.

1115
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:16,889
You molest a child, you beat a child,

1116
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:19,657
you're not on my side.

1117
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,202
If you see me coming, you better run,

1118
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,171
because I am gonna
lay you the fuck down!

1119
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,267

1120
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:36,748

1121
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,687
Is the kid better off without his father?

1122
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,648
Yeah.

1123
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:45,586
But okay, I mean,
could be out there right now,

1124
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,186

What did Remy say about Ray
back in Roxbury?

1139
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,159
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of him.

1140
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:58,290
Now he says Ray's been snitching
for him for 15 years.

1141
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,558
He called him his "old pal."

01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:58,044
(SCOFFS) If it's like that, then
you're gonna have to buy me lunch.

1180
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,810
- How's the Chart House, half hour?
- Sounds about right.

1181
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,652
Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics
with you, right?

1182
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,416
DCU, yeah. What's up?

1183
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:09,013
Why'd he leave?

1184
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:12,652
Had a habit of just
rubbing people the wrong way.

1185
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,787
Like what? What'd he do?

1186
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:17,331
Like marry a prostitute, for one.

1187
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,491
Come on.

1188
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,262
Might not wanna do that
if you're a cop, right?

1189
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:21,927
Might not wanna do that
if you're a plumber.

1190
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:23,437
(LAUGHING)

1191
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:25,801
So, what happened?

1192
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,570
He says he loves her,
tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,

1193
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,736
and puts in for a transfer.

1194
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:30,835
What, to Doyle?

1195
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:34,609
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana, back in '72.

1196
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:38,119
You don't think that Remy's
dirty, though, do you?

1197
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:40,051
What's "dirty"?

1198
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,922
- I know he planted evidence once.
- Oh, you do?

1199
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:48,462
Yeah. Why?

1200
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:51,090
Look, man. CSI is killing us out here.

1201
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,693
Every other juror, all they wanna know
is where the microfibers are.

1202
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,567
Certain people are workers.

1203
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,265
Don't wanna plant it,
but you know how it is.

1204
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,501
So they don't mind it.

1205
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:06,140
So tell me something,
what you fucking with him for?

1206
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,083
He lied to me.

1207
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,416
I can't think of one reason
big enough for him to lie

1208
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:15,115
that's small enough not to matter.

1209
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,756
All right, look.

1210
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:26,290
I know one thing, but it's third party,
so you gotta play it like that.

1211
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,394
Helene and Ray took Cheese's money
back in June, right?

1212
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,495
Yeah.

1213
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:33,541
One week later,
Remy goes to a cop in DCU

1214
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:36,076
asking if anybody knew
who robbed Cheese.

1215
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:37,338
So what?

1216
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,175
So my informant tells me,

1217
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:42,774
Cheese didn't even know
he got robbed until two weeks later.

1218
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:45,918
So Remy knew Cheese got robbed
before Cheese did?

1219
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:47,887
How'd he know that?

1220
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,854
Let me tell you something.

1221
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:51,984
You better think long and hard

1222
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,052
before you start running around here
investigating the police.

1223
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:59,965
You try and take food out their mouths,
and they will fuck you up.

1224
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,471
Thanks for the steak.

1225
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,869
All right.

1226
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,687
Hey.

1227
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:25,215
I got it.

1228
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:27,795
PATRICK ON PHONE:
We need to talk to you, Lionel.

1229
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:29,296
LIONEL ON PHONE:
About what?

1230
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:32,094
About the acoustics in your apartment.

1231
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,725
What?

1232
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,702
Oh, we live
in a three-decker, too, Lionel.

1233
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,636
I got nothing to talk about.

1234
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:40,800
Well, that's fine.
We can talk to the state police.

1235
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,071
Meet me at Murphy's Law.

1236
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,021
LIONEL ON PHONE: I don't meet him
down Murphy's,

1237
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,396
he's gonna call the staties.

1238
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,833
REMY ON PHONE: He's putting a
move on you. Don't go down there.

1239
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:09,994
I can handle Patrick Kenzie.

1240
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:11,766
- This is an oath we took.
- I started this.

1241
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,808
- This has to be protected.
- I got things to protect, too.

1242
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:14,967
- Listen to me!
- All right, Remy.

1243
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:17,409
You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me.

1244
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,811
- Just trust me, all right?
- No! Trust me!

1245
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:24,545
Where I come from,
you die with your secrets!

1246
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:53,213
How long have you known Remy?

1247
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:56,409
Detective Bressant? Just in...

1248
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:59,749
Met him through
the investigation of Amanda.

1249
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,789
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1250
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,354
How long you known Remy?

1251
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,590
What is this?

1252
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:12,633
They got the Internet, now, Lionel.

1253
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,067
You know how it is in town.
Everybody knows everybody.

1254
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,604
No. Everybody don't know everybody.

1255
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,299
- What're you talking about?
- Why you lying?

1256
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:20,363
I'm not.

1257
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:23,206
You bragged about taking a hard bust
on the first day we met you.

1258
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,836
- No, I didn't.
- Bullshit.

1259
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:27,404
You're hiding something, Lionel,
and you better fucking tell it,

1260
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:30,417
'cause you came to our house
and you asked us for help.

1261
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,715
And we killed ourselves
trying to save Amanda.

1262
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:34,618
And I know you ain't being 100%
with me right now,

1263
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:36,623
and it's really fucking pissing me off
that you're lying,

1264
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:39,159
so you better interrupt me at any time,
'cause I'm about to lose...

1265
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:42,128
Okay. Fine, fine. All right?
Don't have a heart attack.

1266
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,425
I haven't been honest with you.

1267
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,469
It's just not something I'm proud of.
You know?

1268
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,403
I got in a bar fight back in the day.

1269
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:52,701
The other guy cracked his skull.

1270
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:55,265
At some point,
I must've said, "I'll kill you."

1271
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:59,712
So they had me up for attempted.
It's my word against this other guy's.

1272
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:02,545
Witness testified to my version
and the jury believed him.

1273
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:05,518
- 'Cause he was a cop.
- Yeah, he testified for me.

1274
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,248
So you knew Detective Bressant.

1275
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,620
- It's not like we were best friends.
- But you lied.

1276
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:12,922
- Why did you call Remy?
- He's a cop.

1277
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,859
- That's not why you called him, Lionel.
- Come on.

1278
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,795
It's a small place.
You heard them arguing.

1279
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:18,457
- They were being loud.
- Who? Who... Who...

1280
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:22,936
So you called Remy, and you and him
took Amanda to blackmail your sister.

1281
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:24,369
(SCOFFS)

1282
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,736
Why would I do that?

1283
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:30,835
I don't know, Lionel. I really don't know.

1284
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:33,904
Maybe because after all the
"I put the fucking plug in the jug,"

1285
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,973
and the "count your blessings"
and the "watch your language,"

1286
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:38,212
you're just like everybody else.

1287
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,186
You saw a bag of money
and you wanted it.

1288
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:41,847
And you thought
you could get away with it.

1289
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,050
But Bea called the media
and made a big thing of it.

1290
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,491
And then she called us,
and then you were fucked.

1291
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,688
The case is closed, Patrick.
The case is closed.

1292
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:51,061
Coke-dealing Haitian's
a pretty easy target for a frame.

1293
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,429
- Lionel?
- Excuse me.

1294
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,558
- Look at me.
- Okay. Excuse me.

1295
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,262
You took your niece,
and you laid it off on a black guy.

1296
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:56,565
- Pardon me.
- Lionel, tell me what happened.

1297
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,765
Can I get some service?

1298
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,205
Yeah.

1299
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:05,411
(EXHALES)

1300
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,381
What?

1301
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:13,113
- Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.
- Yeah.

1302
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:14,678
Thank you.

1303
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:18,016
Just give me a second.

1304
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:52,225
Twenty-three years
is something, right?

1305
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:06,238
Go.

1306
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:13,542
I come up to check on Amanda.
She was alone as usual.

1307
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:18,342
I was reading her a story
when Helene and Ray come home.

1308
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,512
They didn't know I was there.

1309
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:23,114
Stop fucking yelling,
my daughter's sleeping in there.

1310
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:24,749
(ARGUING)

1311
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,888
They started talking about how
they'd robbed this drug dealer.

1312
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:30,055
You know what he's fucking gonna do
if he finds out?

1313
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:31,894
What's the monkey gonna do?

1314
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:33,297
- Oh, you know...
- I'm not...

1315
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:36,531
And they were talking
about leaving the state.

1316
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:38,071
So I called Remy and told him.

1317
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:40,801
There's another drug run
up to Nashua. Taking cocaine...

1318
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:42,536
And then what?

1319
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:47,440
We took her.

1320
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:53,015
Remy laid out this plan.
It seemed easy.

1321
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,955
We take her, force Helene and Ray
to cough up the cash,

1322
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:58,049
then we put her back. You know?

1323
01:24:58,126 --> 01:25:00,185
Amanda gets to spend
a weekend in the country.

1324
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,785
My sister learns a lesson.

1325
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,894
And fuck it, everybody gets paid
on top of it.

1326
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:07,935
I got no problem taking money
from a guy like Cheese.

1327
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:09,560
They were gonna handle the cops.

1328
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,867
But Bea, she went nuts.

1329
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,500
Started calling the papers. Hired you.

1330
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:16,908
Lionel don't want me coming here,
now you don't want the job?

1331
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:20,971
But once you found the money,
they had Amanda and the money.

1332
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:25,179
So they decided to set up
a fake exchange for you to witness.

1333
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,915
They got Chris Mullen
to set up Cheese at the quarry.

1334
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:31,584
15K and a chance to be the boss.

1335
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:36,693
Cheese figured out
what was happening.

1336
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:40,222
Even though it was too late,
he started shooting.

1337
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:42,235
Panicking.

1338
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,205
And she just fell. I mean, she just...

1339
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:48,936
She fell in.

1340
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:52,038
She's gone.

1341
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:54,308
It was an accident.
It was just an accident.

1342
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:56,577
She was your sister's kid, Lionel.

1343
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:02,149
- Your sister's child.
- You think I don't miss her?

1344
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,783
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1345
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:09,990
Last summer, Helene and Dottie
took Amanda to the beach.

1346
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:14,295
It was a real hot day.
Amanda fell asleep.

1347
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:17,261
They left her in the car
while they go off into the dunes,

1348
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,101
smoke a doobie with some guys.

1349
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,903
Two hours.

1350
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:25,340
Amanda literally roasted.

1351
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:28,104
She was three.

1352
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:35,151
Later on, I was holding her,
trying to help her get to sleep.

1353
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:40,855
My little Amanda, she was so hot.

1354
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:46,066
She felt like something
just come out of the oven.

1355
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,700
Like a fucking pot roast.

1356
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:54,171
So don't feel too sorry for my sister.

1357
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:58,008

about anyone but herself.

Or you can get wise, it's up to you.

- I didn't say nothing.

- Jesus. I told him.

I told him we took her for ransom.
I told him. I told him, Remy.

Did any of the witnesses at the bar
contradict anything I've said?

A police officer was killed today.
That's not looked on lightly.

Is corruption looked on lightly?

as a detective.

Now, you're at the quarry
the other night, right?

that this is a setup?

you should've gone to Social Services.
