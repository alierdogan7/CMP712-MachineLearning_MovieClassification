to hear a lie or two about them.

- Is that tea for two?
- (Reggie) All right, Albie?

16
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,374
Hello, boys.

17
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:05,290
How you doing? You all right?
Got you a cup of tea here. You fancy it?

18
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,249
Yeah? No?

19
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,207
What's this?
The old Dagenham Anglia?

20
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,374
Naught to 60 in, what, 40 minutes,
something like that?

21
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:19,415
Phwoar! It's a bit of you, that, innit,
all black and cramped and very sharp.

22
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,040
This one's really milky, for you.

23
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,749
Why don't you fuck off, Kray?

24
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,457
All right, I will. You know,
I wouldn't want to keep you,

25
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:30,665
what with all them rapists and murderers
you gotta lock away, eh, Nipper?

26
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,499
Where do you take a turd in there?

27
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,957
I suppose you just hold it in,
don't you?

28
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,415
All right, then, have a lovely day.
Cheer up. It's nearly Christmas.

29
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,999
Sorry about that.

30
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,707
Where's me driver?
Where's Frank?

31
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,540
- Can't get out of bed in the morning, Reg.
- You what?

32
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,415
He ain't here. He ain't showed up.
His heart ain't in it.

33
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,915
All right, OK.
Well, let's go get him, then, shall we?

34
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,081
- Where is he? On Ormsby Street, yeah?
- Yeah. Jump in, I'll give you a lift.

35
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,874
Nah, you're all right. I'm gonna walk.
It's a lovely day for it.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,290
Don't forget this lot.
They're very important.

37
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,957
- (Donoghue) I won't.
- (Engine starts)

38
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,957
(Whistles) Come on.

39
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,582
(Reggie) I shall walk incredibly slowly.

40
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,624
- All right, Vera?
- All right, Reg?

41
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,207
- How you doing? You good?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,665
Lovely.

43

(Reggie) Rita.

44
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,457
I was going to knock on your door.
Me mum said you left that in the kitchen.

45
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,832
- Oh, I did.
- That yours?

46
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,332
- It is. Oh, thanks ever so much.
- Not a problem. You're welcome.

47
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,790
Isn't he sweet?

48
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,915
East Enders.

49
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:40,249
They won't talk to a policeman,
but they'll kiss a gangster. Eh?

50
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,207
The filthy cockney bastards.

51
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,915
How about we clean your car for you?

52
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,374
You get the bumper
and I'll get the lights.

53
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,207
Frank about?

54
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,999
Frank!

55
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:14,999
Who are you?

56
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,165
Frances. Frank's sister.

57
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,874
Hang about, I recognise you.
See, I recognise you.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,749
You was a little bit younger then.
You got all grown up, didn't you?

59
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,124
It happens.

60
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,457
What have you got there?

61
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,915
A sweet.

62
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,457
That's not any sweet, is it?
That's a lemon sherbet, that is.

63
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,665
Mind if I have a crack?

64
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,124
(Chuckling) All right.

65
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,207
Thank you.

66
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,457
Oh, that's nice, innit?

67
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,415
(Crunching)

68
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,499
- You're not supposed to chew it.
- No?

69
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,583
How else am I supposed to get
to the sherbetty bit?

70
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,749
- By being patient.
- Nah!

71
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,624
Being patient doesn't get you
what you want, does it?

72
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,999
(Window opens)

73
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,624
Half a minute, Reg. Right down.

74
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,582
- Is he in trouble?
- Yeah, he is.

75
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:13,499
Will you go out with me?
I'll go easy on him if you do.

76
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,999
All right.

77
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,999
But not for that reason.

78
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,457
Saturday night.

79
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,165
(Mrs Shea) Who are you talking to?
You're half-dressed,

80
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,499
talking to a man in the door.
What's wrong with you, Frances?

81
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,499
Get back in the kitchen,
finish them dishes.

82
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,332
Hey, this is yours.

83
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,207
Thank you.

84
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,957
Oversleep again, Frank, all right,

85
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,874
and it's back to the cheese shop
or the fish shop

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,957
or whatever shop it was
you come from.

87
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,499
(Frank) Print.

88
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,874
Print shop.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,624
Oh, yeah?

90
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,415
You'll be back to the fucking shit shop,
you understand?

91
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,415
- Yeah.
- What does your sister do?

92
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,249
She goes to one of those, uh,
Pitman Colleges.

93
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,249
You know, typing, shorthand.

94
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,415
- Yeah?
- Yep.

95
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,332
She's got a bit of class, mate.
She's very elegant.

96
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,749
Where you been hiding her?

97
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,582
She been away.

98
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,540
She's a bit, uh, fragile, Reg.

99
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,207
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

100
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,332
- All right.
- (Donoghue) Stop here, Frank.

101
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,624
Five minutes. Won't be long.

102
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,749
How long you reckon it'll take
for him to twig, Albie?

103
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,165
Little bit of cat and mouse.

104
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,415
(Frances) 'Nipper Read was the copper
on the Krays' case.

105
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,832
'And he made his presence known.

106
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,874
'He was heavy-footed, as they say.'

(Dogs barking)

108
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,415
(Ron) And I'm staring
at the back of this geezer's head.

109
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:20,249
The whole time I'm thinking, you know,

110
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:25,124
"Give Ron Kray your sausage.

111
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,499
"Give Ron

112
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,749
"your fucking sausage."

113
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,957
You know?

114
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,540
I was drilling my eyes
into the back of his head.

115
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:50,790
Till I'm not even thinking it anymore.
I'm not... I'm not even thinking.

116
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,624
I'm broadcasting it.

117
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,082
Until he turns around
and you know what he says? He says...

118
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,457
"Hey, Ron, do you fancy my sausage?
I've got... I've got no appetite for it."

119
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,415
Interesting.

120
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,915
(Frances) 'When my future brother-in-law
said "interesting"...'

121
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,082
Ain't it?

122
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:15,707
'...it meant he had no fucking idea what he
or you or anyone else was talking about.'

123
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,582
Fascinating, Ron.

124
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,790
Fascinating.

125
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,374
(Frances) 'Ron had been sentenced
to three years in prison

was a friendly psychiatrist.'

What's that?

131
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:39,499
When you say
you want to "raspberry" this man,

132
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,665
I'm not sure of your vernacular.
What do you mean?

133
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,332
(Big Pat) Raspberry ripple, cripple.

134
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,249
You want to cripple someone?

135
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,207
- Yep, that's right.
- And why is that?

136
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:55,499
Because, Doctor,
I'm afraid he may not be inclined

137
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,999
to provide a favourable evaluation
of my employer.

138
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,499
And who's your employer?

139
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,874
Ronnie Kray.

140
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,249
Is there hope, Doctor?

141
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,707
Excuse me a moment.

142
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,957
(Clears throat)

143
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,332
Take your time.

144
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,707
Ronald Kray possesses
possibly the soundest mind I've seen

145
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,207
in 26 years of psychiatric practice.

146
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,832
In my view, to keep him here
would be a waste of public resources.

147
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,749
A lifetime's integrity down the toilet.

148
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,957
(Frances) 'The Queen would survive,
but God save the rest of us.'

149
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,582
(Gate buzzing)

150
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,957
(Doctor) Mr Kray.

151
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,026
I hope you know what you're doing.

152
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,249
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
I'm going back to London, gonna take the...

153
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,332
Your brother has no real idea
who or what he is.

154
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,957
Nor does he trust his own senses.

155
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,457
I've never seen a man
so desperately in need of reassurance.

156
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,124
We all like a nice little compliment
now and again, don't we?

157
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,457
Your brother is arbitrary,
violent and psychopathic,

158
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,790
probably paranoid schizophrenic.

159
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,624
What I'm trying to tell you
is that he's off his fucking rocker.

160
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,249
It's called Stemetil.

161
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,374
You need to give it to your brother
twice a day

162
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,832
or there's going to be serious trouble.

163
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,915
(Frank) Oi, Frances, the car's outside.

164
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,665
(Sighs)

165
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,040
(Frank) Oh! (Chuckles)

166
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,790
You've got glamour, Frances.
You're like an East End starlet.

167
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,499
East End harlot's more like it.

168
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,332
(Frank) They're trousers, Mum.
She doesn't look like a harlot.

169
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,249
(Mrs Shea) What she's wearing
doesn't matter.

170
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,499
When people see her with Reggie Kray,
they'll think she's a tart.

171
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,082
Why would you say that?

172
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,624
He's a gangster, Frances.
The Krays are gangsters.

173
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,499
- Well, I think he's sweet.
- Oh, God!

174
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,749
And I'm going to kiss him.
Do you hear me?

175
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

176
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,790
You look lovely.

177
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,290
So do you.

178
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,665
Hello. This is Big Pat.

179
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,374
- Hello, Big Pat.
- Reggie.

180
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,832
- How you doing? You all right, mate?
- Miss. Nice to see you.

181
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,957
Big Pat's here to keep riff-raff out.

182
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,790
Always. (Chuckles)

183
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,540
So how come you're
letting us in, then, mate?

184
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,499
- (Laughing)
- Have a good night.

185
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,249
- Thank you.
- Thanks, mate. Cheers.

186
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,499
Oh, hello, here's trouble.
Hold the phone.

187
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,040
- Oi, you. How you doing, big man?
- You all right, boss?

188
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,624
- Are you well?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

189
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,999
- You behaving yourself?
- Always. I'm a teddy bear, me.

190
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,165
Go easy. If he gives you any trouble,
come and speak to me. Come on.

191
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,082
- You all right, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm good. She's good.

192
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,457
- (Man 1) Hello, Reg.
- Hello.

193
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,832
(Man 2) Reg, you all right?
(Man 3) Mr Kray.

194
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,999
- Everyone here knows you.
- Yeah, well, I own it, it's my club.

195
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,790
- You mean it's your local?
- No, I own the place. It's mine.

196
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,040
I've been by here 10 times,
I never knew it was yours.

197
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,749
Well, you can get away with a lot in life
if you keep your mouth shut.

198
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,749
Ooh, that's Teddy.
Hang on a second.

199
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,082
How you doing? You all right?
Good to see you. You good?

200
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,749
How's the family? Excellent.

201
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,624
- What?
- Those men look frightening.

202
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,165
No, no, they're just East End boxers.
They're lovely.

203
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,540
I let 'em drink in here for free,
you know.

204
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,665
Reggie, that's Joan Collins.

205
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,040
Yeah, might be, yeah.

206
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,624
We had that Barbara Windsor in here
the other night.

207
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,590
- Really?
- She comes in quite a bit, actually.

208
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,040
She loves it.
And, uh, that's my formula.

209
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:56,249
What I like to do is I like to mix celebrities
with a few, just a few, East End villains.

210
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,749
The punters, they love it.
It's really good for business.

211
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,999
Would you like a seat?

212
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,290
Excuse me, Reg.
Have you, uh, got a moment?

213
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,332
No, I don't, actually.
I'm busy. All right?

214
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,665
- Nah, it's important, Reg.
- This is important as well, so...

215
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,124
- Reg.
- All right.

216
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,249
Frances, would you mind if I, um...

217
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,335
if I take care of some business
just for a moment?

218
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,999
- No, of course not.
- Excuse me. Be back in a minute.

219
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,874
You sit with her. What is it?

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,457
- It's back here.
- What?

221
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,499
- Hello, Reg.
- All right, mate?

222
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,582
(Man) In fact, if you don't know,
you don't fucking know.

223
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,290
- You know what I mean?
- (Donoghue) Reggie.

224
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,082
How are you, Reg?

225
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,624
I'm all right. I can't complain.
Who'd fucking listen?

226
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,624
- What's the palaver? Go on.
- Sit down, Reg. Sit down, please.

227
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,790
All right.

228
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,915
You had a question about our take
in the purple heart business. Pill game.

229
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,374
- Go on.
- Jack here would like to explain himself.

230
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,540
Go on.

231
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,582
Go on, Jack.
Tell Reggie what you told me.

232
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,665
Well, Reg...

233
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,499
- Yeah?
- I, uh...

234
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,832
The thing is, under normal
circumstances, my accounts...

235
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,790
Are you going to take all fucking night,
mate? 'Cause I've got things to do.

236
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,707
Tell him, Jack. Go on, spit it out.

237
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,707
- I borrowed a few quid off the top.
- Right. All right.

238
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,233
- I sold a few pills on the side.
- Yeah, there's a surprise.

239
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,165
Things have been a bit tight at home

240
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,082
and I was just trying
to keep the wife happy.

241
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,408
Trying to keep the wife happy.

242
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,624
Is this why you brought me in here,
for this? This nonsense?

243
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,290
- It's important business, Reg.
- It's important, is it? Yeah?

244
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,082
- You should know about this.
- All right, let's deal with this business.

245
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:32,165
Tomorrow, you come back to work,
and you pay back every fucking penny.

246
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,415
- I was going to suggest that.
- Good. Right. Are we done?

247
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,499
Everybody happy?

248
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,832
All right, then, can I get back
to my fucking evening?

249
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,832
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Albie. Cheers.

250
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,624
- Sorry for wasting your time, Jack.
- Thanks.

251
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,874
Thanks for coming in.

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,832
- Here you go, mate.
- (Lighter clicks)

253
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,624
Good?

254
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,624
You fucking little thieving cunt.
You understand?

255
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,915
I heard me. Yeah?

256
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,040
Next time I'll finish you off,
you little slag.

257
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,249
- Get him out of here. Fuck him off.
- (Jack) Fuck!

258
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,374
You fucking what?
What did you say?

259
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,165
Don't you swear in my club.
Get him out of here right now.

260
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,790
Don't swear in my club. Wanker.

261
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,582
- Listen, there's something else.
- No, there isn't something else,

262
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,040
'cause I've got a young lady in here
and I'm entertaining.

263
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,249
- Have a look at that. See that there?
- I see it.

264
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,915
I'm entertaining, all right?
So I'm gonna have an evening to myself.

265
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,624
- This is important business.
- Can't be. My business, innit?

266
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,999
It's my business. I would know.

267
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,832
Night, Albie.

268
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,582
Hello.
Did I miss anything important?

269
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,165
- No, just me.
- Now, that is important.

270
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,415
- Is it?
- Very important.

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,499
Thank you.

272
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,749
Thank you.

273
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,540
(Mouthing)

274
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:53,249
So, um... your brother, he was telling me
that you, uh... you're going to college

275
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:57,082
to... to study to be a secretary.
Is that right?

276
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,457
Yeah, anything
to get out of the East End.

277
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,082
What's so bad about the East End?

278
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,290
I've just got bigger dreams than pushing
a pram or haggling with the butcher.

279
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,707
Hmm.

280
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,499
I just don't quite know
what they are yet.

281
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,415
Well, the East End's not that bad.

282
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,332
The centre of the earth
can be anywhere you like.

283
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,124
- Even here?
- Yeah, even here.

284
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,540
- In Bethnal Green?
- Yeah, Bethnal Green.

285
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,874
(Inhales deeply)

286
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,207
Do you like being a gangster?

287
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,582
I'm not a gangster.

288
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,165
I'm a club owner.

289
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,999
(Chuckles)

290
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,332
I like the money and I like the respect
of being a club owner.

291
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,999
But I'm not a gangster.

292
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,249
I could have been a boxer,

293
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,749
but then, you know... hello, mate...

294
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,749
I'd end up looking like
some sort of potato.

295
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,957
And I wouldn't even know
what day of the week it was.

296
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,665
This way, at least I know
who I am, you know?

297
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,832
More so, I like the fact that
I've made a little something of myself.

298
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,082
I don't owe the world anything.

299
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,790
So long as the world agrees with you.

300
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,499
I think the world will be all right.

301
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,249
(Winston Churchill on speakers)
'We shall fight on the beaches.

302
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,874
'We shall fight on the landing grounds.

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
- 'We shall fight in the fields...'
- (Approaching footsteps)

304
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,915
'...and in the streets.

305
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,332
'We shall fight in the hills.

306
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,582
'We shall never surrender, and if...'

307
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,624
- Hey, Ronnie!
- (Recording stops)

308
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,749
Ronnie, come on out.
You've got visitors, mate.

309
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,999
Watch your step. It's a bit wet.

310
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,207
- You all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

311
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,582
- You must be Frances.
- Hello.

312
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,874
Huh?

313
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,874
Hello, Frances. Hello.
Welcome to the family.

314
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,665
Well, it's a bit premature,
that, is it?

315
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,124
(Chuckles)

316
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,665
- You don't have a beer that I could have?
- Yeah, of course I do. Help yourself.

317
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,624
Don't mind if I have a beer, do you?

318
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,874
I'll let you get to know each other.

319
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,332
Want a cup of tea?
I just put the kettle on.

320
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,624
Take a seat. Go on.

321
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,874
Sit down anywhere you like.

322
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,999
Needs a bit of warming up. So...

323
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,040
What do you think?

324
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,624
Do you think that we look alike,
me and Reggie?

325
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,082
Oh, yes, certainly.

326
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,540
No, you don't.
You think that he's beautiful

327
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,499
and I've got a face
like a gorilla's arse.

328
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,374
- (Laughs)
- It's all right, don't worry about it.

329
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,332
- No. I wouldn't say that.
- I'm used to it.

330
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,058
(Reggie) Stop doing your hair, right?
Get me stuff out of the car.

331
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,540
Do something fucking useful.

332
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,499
Yeah, go on, then.

333
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,540
I'm homosexual, Frances.

334
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,332
Well, I am a, uh... I'm a giver, right?
I'm not a receiver.

335
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,082
There is a difference. I'm not a faggot.

336
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,290
But I do believe that, you know,
you should not hide what you are.

337
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:19,582
You shouldn't hide what you are
'cause it'll make you very sad, you know?

338
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,457
It'll make you very sad.
It'll make you very unwell.

339
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,499
- I agree completely.
- Mmm.

340
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,624
You know, me and my brother,
we're going to rule London.

341
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,915
(Frances) 'The Krays' main rivals
were the Richardsons of South London.

342
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,790
'They were called the Torture Gang.'

343
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,165
For the benefit of the jury,

344
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:46,374
on whose behalf were you operating
on this side of the river?

345
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,249
Come on, Charlie, please.
I'm begging you.

346
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,332
No, no, no. You do business
with the court as an entity,

347
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,790
- therefore, address the court.
- What?

348
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,207
- What? "Your Honour"!
- (Grunts) Fuck!

349
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,582
You say "Your Honour".

350
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,332
By saying "Your Honour",
you gain the court's attention

351
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,540
and open up a channel
of communication, a conduit.

352
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,582
So, we'll try again.

353
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,999
For the benefit of the jury,

354
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,082
on whose behalf were you working
on this side of the river?

355
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,915
- Please, Charlie! I fucking beg of you!
- Order!

356
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,124
Order in this, my court!

357
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,249
(Grunting) Fuck!

358
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,874
You're in Indian country, old son.

359
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,124
That's what them cockneys
call south of the river, innit?

360
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,040
Indian country.

361
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,999
Well, what are you doing
on my reservation without my say-so,

362
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,290
filling up your canteen
from my fucking watering hole?

363
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,624
You ain't got the bottle to do that
on your own, son. Who do you work for?

364
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,790
I don't know what you're on about, Charlie.
I don't know what you're on about.

365
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,207
- Say their names. Say it!
- Fuck.

366
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,665
- Buzz him.
- Uh, objection, Your Honour.

367
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,665
My client is an upstanding citizen.

368
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,040
Objection overruled
on the grounds it's boring.

369
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,249
Oh, well, fuck him.

370
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,290
- (Crackling)
- (Screaming)

371
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:02,249
- Say it. Say "the Krays", you daft cunt.
- Fuck it!

372
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,790
No, no.
No leading the witness, Eddie.

373
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,332
- (Engine revving)
- (Tyres squealing)

374
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,790
Fuck off!

375
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,790
Alexander might have been great,
but he wasn't a Greek.

376
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,790
- No?
- No. He was a Macedonian.

377
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,874
But he loved them, though,
Aristotle and that lot.

378
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,582
He was deeply impressed
by them flash Hellenistic cunts.

379
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,207
Christos, get us some more
of that awful retsina.

380
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,582
(Woman screams)

381
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,624
Charlie, we've got to fucking sort this.

382
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,582
You're absolutely right.
Christos, where's my retsina?

383
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,415
(Frances) 'The Richardsons
sent George Cornell to call for a truce.

384
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,707
'All they were saying
was give peace a chance.'

385
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,915
- Fucking Frank'll win.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck!

386
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,874
- Are you wearing your bravery jacket?
- We're here to parley.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,332
I will fucking map you up, Southie.

388
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,915
No, no, no. Go on, let him in.
He's only little.

389
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,790
Things have got out of hand.
Charlie wants to meet.

390
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,790
Pig and Whistle. Neutral ground.

391
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,374
Just him, you two and Eddie.

392
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,290
Yep. And how do we know
that we're going to be safe?

393
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:43,999
Well, that's a little thing
called trust, ain't it?

394
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:48,665
Trust, eh? You always got one bloke
harping on about trust, don't you?

395
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,582
But then you look
over your shoulder, right,

396
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,040
and you see there's another bloke there,
right, with his Hampton in his hand

397
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,749
and he's preparing to shove his cock
right up your arse.

398
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,457
Well, you wouldn't mind that.

399
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,957
You fat poof.

400
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,374
(Cocks gun)

401
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,374
Whoa, no. No, no, no...

402
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,582
Right, you, get him out of here.
Go on, fuck off.

403
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,749
- One hour. We'll be with you.
- That's it, bye-bye.

404
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,457
Fuck off, George.

405
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,415
There's the door, go on.

406
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,540
- Bye-bye.
- Take that dead fox with you. Go on.

407
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,624
Get out, you prick.

408
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,332
What a fucking liberty.

409
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,540
Big Charlie, please could I have
another egg?

410
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,915
I've eaten this one.

411
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,915
I don't like it, Reggie.

412
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,999
Nah, it's all right.

413
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,540
I know them. I know the pub.

414
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,165
We'll be all right.

415
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,665
You got to clean that fucking toilet, mate.
It stinks.

416
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,499
Mate, I paid a girl to do it.
It's not my fault if she don't.

417
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,145
- What are you having to drink?
- Um...

418
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,249
Forget it. They just walked in.

419
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,441
- Mate, can I get two Guinnesses, please?
- Hang on a second.

420
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,415
I just gotta go down
to change the barrel.

421
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,082
Reg. Ron.

422
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,207
The Richardsons were
unexpectedly engaged,

423
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,915
so we're going to look after you.

424
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,790
Oh, it's all right. The landlord's gone
to change the barrel for me. Thanks.

425
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,999
You don't mind
if I pull myself a pint, do you?

426
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,457
- What is that?
- What do you think, poof?

427
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,790
It's a fucking tool.

428
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:20,540
No, it's not. It's a fucking rolling pin.
Who are you, Fanny Cradock?

429
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,947
What are you gonna do with that?
You gonna bake me a cake?

430
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,540
You gonna sing me a song,
watch me blow out me fucking candles?

431
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,832
I come here
for a fucking shootout, right?

432
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:33,540
A proper shootout
with some proper men,

433
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:37,124
like Colonel Custer and Geronimo.
Have you ever heard of 'em? No.

434
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,832
'Cause you were too busy in your pinny
baking fucking fairy cakes, weren't you?

435
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,749
Reg, this lot are fucking nonces, to a man.
They're fucking nonces.

436
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,457
Get out of me fucking way.
Go on, get out. Go on, fuck off.

437
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,082
Call yourself a fucking gangster?

438
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,249
A shootout, right,
is a fucking shootout!

439
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,790
Like a Western.

440
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,457
Wankers! Fucking embarrassing.

441
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,874
Waste of my time.
Fucking waste of my time.

442
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,749
Well, your brother's done a runner.

443
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:17,207
Ah, he's just genuinely disappointed
with you. That's all.

444
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:21,040
Look at that. Full of iron, that is.

445
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:24,790
See, it takes a while, that does,
you know, to settle.

446
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:27,957
Charlie Richardson said we're to knock
the granny out of you, Reg.

447
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:32,290
Oh, yeah? He did, did he?
That's good of him. All right, listen.

448
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,915
When you see him next,
you tell him from me, yeah,

449
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:38,624
that I say... fuck Charlie, right?

450
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,582
And fuck his brother, yeah?

451
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,249
And fuck that fat Georgie Cornell
that hangs out with him.

452
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,665
Fuck your face. Yeah, yeah?

453
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:50,332
And fuck the fucking lot of you as well.
What do you think of that? Eh?

454
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,874
- You like that?
- Mmm.

455
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,957
- You won't mind if I fight back, will you?
- You think you can manage it?

456
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,207
Ah, it's more for me pride, really,
to be honest.

457
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,124
I warn you,
I'm not gonna fight fair, though.

458
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,790
So I brought these.

459
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,374
All right?

460
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,874
Now, before we start,
I got a little joke for you.

461
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,749
You'll love this one.

462
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,165

00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,207
What's this about, Mr Payne?

499
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:36,124
This is about a gambling casino in
Knightsbridge called Esmeralda's Barn.

500
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,832
- I'm not familiar with it.
- Really?

501
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:39,624
Well, you'll be shocked to learn

502
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,207
that you earned £24,000 from it
in the last three months.

503
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:47,082
My friends and I would like
to purchase it from you.

504
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:49,499
We have the contracts ready
for your signature.

505
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,040
(Frances) 'Ruling London involved
intelligence and intimidation.'

506
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,624
It's not for sale.

507
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,207
(Chuckling)

508
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:03,540
You might find that in the future,
there is a less polite approach.

509
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:06,915
(Frances) 'The trick was to cultivate
a quiet certainty

510
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,165
'that should it be needed,
violence was on offer...'

511
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,332
Yeah.

512
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,138
(Frances)
'...and would be happily applied.

513
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,457

'Reggie found Payne useful,
but Ron was suspicious of him,

'afraid his scams were the opposite
of what a gangster should be.'

516
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:26,832
- Consider Las Vegas.
- All right.

517
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,540
It's all legal, all run by the Mafia.

518
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:31,540
Soon, London will be the same.

519
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,582
What with Havana gone,
the Mafia is moving in.

520
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:36,290
Meyer Lansky
has already made inquiries.

521
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,790
- Meyer Lansky?
- Yeah.

522
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,749
What, as in the Meyer Lansky?

523
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,374
Meyer Lansky.

524
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,540
Are the Americans gonna try
and muscle in on us?

525
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,874
No. They don't work that way.
They don't want a war, Ron.

526
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,957
- They're businessmen.
- Well, maybe I want a war with them.

527
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,207
(Leslie) Now, look.

528
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,332
What they do want is to know
who is the up-and-coming local firm,

529
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,332
because they will colonise London
by financing that firm,

530
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,957
then franchising the city.

531
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,499
So you have to prove to the Americans
that the Krays are the only game in town.

532
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:08,499
Yeah, very fucking interesting.

533
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,999
The world could be our oyster.

534
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,374
- (Ron) Payne.
- What?

535
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,832
You say "our" a lot, right?

536
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:21,832
You say "our"
and you also say "we" a lot.

537
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,624
Do I?

538
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,540
My question is,
is your last name Kray?

539
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,207
(Chuckles)

540
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:34,374
Listen, Ron, you keep the pearls.
I'm perfectly happy with the soft bits.

541
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,290
Yeah, I bet you are.

542
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,915
I bet you are.

543
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:44,082
Reggie, I say it's a very bad idea.
It's just a bad idea.

544
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:48,082
I say, right, that we meet these
Mafioso scum at London Airport, right?

545
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,082
We pick them up, we chop them up,

546
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:54,082
put them in their fucking luggage
and send them straight home, mate.

547
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,082
That's the plan.

548
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:08,374
Well, I'm glad
we could have this meeting.

549
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,790
Mr Lansky has taken an interest
in the Colony Sporting Club.

550
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:13,915
He has his casino people there
right now.

551
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:17,624
Well, Mr Lansky might want to know

552
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,832
that we happen to have
a casino of our own.

553
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:24,290
Really? Your own casino?

554
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,832
Well, you see, we own Las Vegas.

555
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,874
(Smirks)

556
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:31,332
But here,
the Atlantic Ocean is in our way.

557
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,415
So Mr Lansky lacks the ability

558
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:36,790
to, uh... ensure the physical security
of his property,

559
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:40,582
from both outside muscle and the cops.

560
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,290
He thinks the Kray family could help.

561
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,749
London is going to be
the Las Vegas of Europe.

562
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:49,624
We need someone to front
and someone to muscle for us.

563
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,749
Uh... I mean, look,
we can do your security, right,

564
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,540
that's not a problem, you know,
but we don't want to work for you.

565
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,540
I mean, we'd much rather
that we work with you.

566
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,040
What Reggie is trying to say...

567
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:05,582
I think he knows what he's trying to say.
He just said it.

568
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,707
- We're in your backyard.
- Yeah.

569
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,374
And Mr Lansky is open
to discussions of this nature.

570
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,499
He sends this as a goodwill gesture.

571
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:16,290
Just a taste. For expenses.
Open it, please.

572
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:26,874
Now, the second briefcase contains
business of my own I need to take care of.

573
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,540
Please.

574
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,457
Bearer bonds. Free money.

575
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,874
A hundred grand
in negotiable bearer bonds.

576
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,665
Jacked from a bank in Montreal.

577
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,540
Too hot to move in North America.

578
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,290
That's a hundred grand.

579
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,915
Could you guys handle that?

580
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,790
Yeah, we can handle it.

581
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,915
Really? Good.

582
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,124
Boys who jacked it get 20%.

583
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,207
We split the rest 60-40.

584
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,874
If this works out, Reggie,

585
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,624
I got a $2 million backlog
of those scharoles.

586
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,040
Does that sound
like you're staying out of our way?

587
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,832
50-50, mate.

588
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,124
I like you, Reggie.

589
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,082
50-50 it is. Done.

590
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,499
I'm glad we could make a deal.

591
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,790
- Yeah.
- Now, this feels right.

592
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:30,790
Listen, you come to Philadelphia
any time,

593
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:34,332
you see what you want, any size,
any shape, right? We'll get it for you.

594
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:37,249
A nice Italian girl.
Little spaghetti and meatballs.

595
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,499
I prefer boys.

596
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,040
Excuse me? I didn't catch that.

597
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,165
I said I prefer boys.

598
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,540
Italians, actually.

599
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,624
Sometimes Greek,
but I am not prejudiced.

600
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,874
No. Because I happen
to have had a Negro once

601
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,499
and a Tahitian,
who I bent up like a pretzel.

602
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,082
I really fucking hurt him.

603

to admit that, kid.

(Frances) You don't understand!
He's not what you think he is! All right?

613
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:39,582
He's really sweet.
And it's exciting being with him!

614
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,749
Just because you have a boring life
doesn't mean I have to as well!

615
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:46,499
(Shea) The reason I have a boring life
is because I gave up my life for you!

00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,249
(Door closes)

668
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,207
You're nothing in here.
Nothing!

669
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:00,082
- Fuck him up.
- (Grunting)

670
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:01,832
Fuck him up!

671
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:05,999
(Inmate 1) Leave him alone!

672
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,915
(Inmate 2) Bury 'em, Reggie!

673
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,499
(Guard) Shut up, all of you!

674
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,165
(Inmate 3) Fucking let 'em have it!
(Inmate 4) Go on, Reg!

675
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:14,707
(Inmates shouting indistinctly)

676
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:17,415
(Guard) Ain't so tough now,
are you, hey?

677
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:20,624
Easy.

678
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:24,290
Get him in. (Grunting)

679
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,790
You're nothing in here.

680
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,707
- Nothing.
- Please, no more, guvnor! Please.

681
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:32,082
"Please, please, please."
That's more like it, Reggie.

682
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,249
- "Please." Eh?
- Please!

683
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:38,082
Eh? A bit of respect.
Doesn't hurt, does it?

684
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,457
(Reggie) No more.

685
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,790
(Guard) I have shit bigger turds.

686
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,374
Please, water.

687
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,832
(Guard) Oh, you want some water?

688
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:50,499
Look at that, gents.
He's only begging for water.

689
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,582
What do you make of it now, eh,
your famous Reggie fucking Kray?

690
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:57,332
- (Inmate) Fuck you!
- Begging for fucking water.

691
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,207
What has he come to?

692
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,832
Here you are, Reg.

693
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,874
Now, don't spill it.

694
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,499
'Cause you've had a little tumble,
haven't you? Eh?

695
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,457
Here it is.

696
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,957
- (Groaning)
- Good boy.

697
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:12,290
- Can I have water?
- Here he is, look.

698
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:15,290
Look at this. Reggie Kray.

699
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:17,082
Begging fucking water...

700
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:25,124
(Inmates shouting indistinctly)

701
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:29,915
(Inmates chanting)
Reggie! Reggie! Reggie...

702
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,999
Hello, Frances.

703
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,749
- Hello, Ron.
- (Ron) I saw Reg today.

704
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:53,832
He sends his best. He says it's probably
best that you don't go and visit him yet.

705
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,749
Did he say why?

706
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:57,207
Nah, didn't mention it.

707
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,165
Do you know it is possible, right,

708
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,832
for a person to become a ghost
while they're still alive.

709
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:08,290
You think so?

710
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,915
Well, it's happened to you, ain't it?

711
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,499
(Payne) No, no, no. No, look.

712
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,832
- Listen.
- "No" what?

713
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,415
No, no, no. Please, please.
Just for a moment, just listen.

714
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:27,624
Gambling clubs are legally obliged
to pay winnings on the spot.

715
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,624
And that is why we insist our gamblers
pay their debts on the spot as well.

716
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,499
Yes, I know. I've heard you.
But that's your problem. Right?

717
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,124
That's your problem, not mine.

718
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,040
Mine is that I want £50,000.

719
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,499
Here you go again
with your £50,000 to go to Nigeria.

720
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,624
No, it's not just
to go to Nigeria, is it?

721
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,915
I want to set up a company.
All right?

722
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:54,374
I want to build a city in Nigeria,
for the children.

723
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,499
- Near Enugu.
- Enugu.

724
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,999
- Yes, Enugu.
- (Ron) Yes, Enugu.

725
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,874
I told you, Enugu! Right?

726
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,790
You don't know everything,
do you, Payne?

727
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:06,124
Did you know that "Enugu"
is the African word for "utopia"?

728
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,707
- No.
- No, you did not.

729
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:10,999
Did you know that "utopia"
is the Greek word for "nowhere"?

730
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,207
For £50,000,
I can make that somewhere.

731
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,249
I can turn it into a place
where people will smile at me

732
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,832
- and children will dance...
- I will smile for you, Ron.

733
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:25,665
I will smile for you if you tell me
where I can get £50,000.

734
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,671
I'm telling you. I'm fucking telling you.
Just pull it out of the casino.

735
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:32,415
- I cannot pull it out of the casino...
- Just pull it out of the casino, you cunt.

736
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:35,249
Do not meddle with a foolproof way
of making the money!

737
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,999
I'm not a fucking banker!

738
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,582
I am not a fucking banker!

739
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:42,499
- Right? Am I?
- Genius! Look at that.

740
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,290
That has made it
all the more manageable.

741
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:47,177
- This man who wants to build a city!
- Don't you fucking threaten me!

742
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:50,207
Don't you fucking dare
talk to me like that, you cunt!

743
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:55,374
Reggie is not here now, all right?
He's fucking gone, ain't he?

744
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,457
So you work for me, Ron Kray!

745
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:01,582
So you will trot along down
to the fucking bank,

746
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,665
and you will fetch me my £50,000.

747
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,457
Yeah, I'll go down to the bank
and see what I can do.

748
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,707
And I'll tell you what,
I may work for you, Ron,

749
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:13,915
but I'm certainly not afraid of you,
all right?

750
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:17,540
Well, that is fucking stupid as well,
because you fucking should be.

751
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:21,624
Because if my brother hadn't have
vouched for you, you'd be fucking dead.

752
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:28,124
(Bell ringing)

753
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,832
(Baby crying)

754
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,124
What happened?

755
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:55,957
What are you doing here?
Didn't Ronnie tell you not to come?

756
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:01,082
- I missed you.
- Look.

757
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,082
Frankie, I don't want you to come here
and see me like this, understand?

758
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,832
- Who did it?
- What?

759
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,749
Your face.
Was it one of the other prisoners?

760
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:13,540
No, no.
It was one of the guards, all right?

761
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:15,790
- Well, have you reported them?
- No.

762
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,624
But you know what?
When I get out, I'm thinking

763
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,750
I might go to the Houses of Parliament,
have a word with the Prime Minister,

764
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,374
'cause he will listen, he will.

765
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,624
Frankie, this is prison, OK?

766
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,207
That's what this is.
It's the law of the jungle in here.

767
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,213
But don't worry about it,
because I'm a big boy,

768
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,707
I can look after meself
and I'll be out very soon. All right?

769
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:36,290
Go on, have a look at that lump
over there, you see him?

770
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,582
With the big hat.

771
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:41,207
There's a very good reason
why we all call him Handbag.

772
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,999
All right?

773
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,915
I don't want a life like this.

774
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:54,624
- Just waiting, while you're in prison.
- I know. I know.

775
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,582
(Exhales deeply)

776
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,624
- Frankie, it won't happen again.
- How can you be sure?

777
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,915
Because I know. Because I promise you
it won't happen again.

778
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,832
All right?

779
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,624
I know how you can be sure.

780
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,499
- Go on.
- You could go straight.

781
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:18,374
Be a casino owner, a club owner.
You enjoy it.

782
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,165
Just forget everything else.

783
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:25,082
It really is that simple for you, innit?
Yeah, just go straight.

784
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:31,290
Babe, life isn't always the way
we want it to be, you know.

785
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:33,249
Life has other plans. It...

786
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,999
- It's the way it is. It's life.
- I love you.

787
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,832
I love you.

788
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:47,290
I never loved anybody before,
but I love you, Reggie.

789
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,915
And I love you, too.

790
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,207
(Sighs)

791
00:45:58,041 --> 00:45:59,582
You think it can protect people?

792
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,999
What?

793
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,082
Love.

794
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:10,165
(Ron) I like him. Yeah, he got
something about him, ain't he?

795
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:13,540
(Mad Teddy) Do you know
what I reckon it is? I think it's his hips.

796
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,832
I want to blow the soul
out of that horn.

797
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,290
You feeling a bit horny, are you, Ron?

798
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:24,374
- I am. I am.
- (Chuckling)

799
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,207
- Go on. Do it.
- I will. Yeah.

800
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,582
I want to blow the soul
out of that horn.

801
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:32,124
That's what I'm gonna do.
OK? OK?

802
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,124
Tiger!

803
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,915
(Blows horn off-key)

804
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:46,707
That's it, Ron, give it a fucking blow.

805
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,415
(Giggling)

806
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,124
(Ron) Kill it.

807
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,249
- (♪ Music stops)
- (Indistinct murmuring)

808
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,624
Oh, fucking hell.

809
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,290
Right.

810
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,749
Hello. Hello?

811
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,124
Yes, Ron. Hello.

812
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,415
Do you know when I plan to die?

813
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,957
- When, Ron?
- At the very last minute.

814
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,749
(Laughing)

815
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:26,082
Don't fucking encourage him,
for fuck's sake.

816
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:31,082
Look at you, you flash fuckers. Eh?

817
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:36,290
Now, I may not be very good, granted.

818
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,374
But good gangster?

819
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:42,374
Oh, yeah.
I'll fucking claim that title.

820
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,332
And how many titles
could you claim? Eh?

821
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,582
Superficialite. Hmm?

822
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:54,040
Oh, yeah.
Dripping in your synthetic opulence.

823
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:55,790
Ha!

824
00:47:56,666 --> 00:48:00,540
It's disgusting. Really is.
Yeah.

825
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,915
Right, a bit of magic.
You love magic, don't you?

826
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:04,749
All kids love magic.

827
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:09,957
You might all be aware
that there are three magic Cs, right,

828
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,957
in the word "carpaccio". Yeah?

829
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:15,332
But how many Cs...

830
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,707
...are in the word "cunt"?

831
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,749
Just you.

832
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,999
(Laughing)

833
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,832
(Microphone clatters)

834
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,582
(Clinking on window)

835
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:50,874
You're free.

836
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:54,165
What are you doing
throwing stones at the window?

837
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,790
They're not, they're not stones.

838
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:58,207
These are... these are lemon sherbets.
Here you go.

839
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:02,124
Oh, well played.

840
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,665
Why don't you ring the bell?

841
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,124
Well, your mum.

842
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,082
I mean, I'm not being funny,

843
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:11,082
but the thought of your mum answering
that door is a bit shocking, so...

844
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:13,082
I thought she'd give me grief
on account of where I've been.

845
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:17,249
- You mean prison?
- Yeah, prison. You look beautiful.

846
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,499
You look beautiful, too.

847
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,124
I know it's a bit late, right, but...

848
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,749
I've got your Christmas present here.

849
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,665
- Do you want me to throw it up?
- No.

850
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:30,749
What? You want me to deliver it?
I ain't going through that door.

851
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:31,999
All right.

852
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,374
You cheeky bugger.

853
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:42,207
Be careful.

854
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,499
(Grunts) A bit late now, innit?

855
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,332
Right!

856
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:51,249
- Your flowers.
- Thank you.

857
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,707
And...

858
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,624
...your Christmas present.

859
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,499
Sorry it's late.

860
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,874
Go on, open it.

861
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,624
Frances Shea, will you marry me?

862
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,874
We'll live free and above-board?

863
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:19,290
On my honour.

864
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:25,290
Yes, Reggie Kray, I will marry you.

865
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:32,665
- (Reggie) Mmm.
- (Crunching)

866
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:34,040
That one of mine?

867
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:36,832
Cheeky.

868
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,374
(♪ Striptease music playing)

869
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,124
That's it.

870
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,499
Come on,
show us your fucking hoochie.

871
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,624
- Give us a fucking look.
- You're not listening. You're not listening.

872
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,957
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is
crime is still a business.

873
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:58,374
You need a public relations department,
and we've got Joseph Goebbels.

874
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,082
- (Chuckling)
- Is he the fat one?

875
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:03,749
You read lips. What's he saying?
What's he saying, Les?

876
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:08,957
I'm struggling, but I think he's saying
something about gobbles or no balls?

877
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,665
That's very strange.

878
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,165
He ain't happy. You'll see.

879
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,499
Nice, innit?

880
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:26,874
Oh, he looks lovely, Ron.

881
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,082
He's put on
a little bit of timber, ain't he?

882
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:32,249
He's going to be very, very upset.

883
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:35,040
Did I miss something?

884
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,707
Is this not...
This is Friday night, right?

885
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,165
Well, I tried to tell you.

886
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:41,790
Yeah, but it's Friday night, right?

887
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,836
You didn't tell me
that it was this bad, did you?

888
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:46,874
It's Ron, innit?
He's run the place into the ground.

889
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,790
He's turned a straight money earner
into a financial wreck.

890
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:53,790
And another thing: This place will crash
when we get our tax bill next week.

891
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:56,457
What's he saying? What's he saying?

892
00:51:56,583 --> 00:52:00,582
He's just told him that you're missing
tax payments. Silly cunt!

893
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,415
Let's go.

894
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,415
This is tomorrow's business.
Do you understand?

895
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,749
That's very rude.

896
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:17,207
- Oi, where are you going?
- It's fucking criminal, mate!

897
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,790
Criminal!

898
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,707
Hey, where are you going?

899
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:29,832
Oh, there he is,
my beautiful brother, Reggie.

900
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,374
A toast to my beautiful brother.

901
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,749
Home at last,
like Agamemnon returned to Ithaca.

902
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,832
And beautiful Frances.

903
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,290
Where have you been?

904
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,082
It's as if you've returned
from the dead.

905
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:46,540
What are you doing, mate?
What are you fucking playing at? Eh?

906
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,249
I'm not playing at anything.
It's you.

907
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,499
You come in here.
You don't even say, "Hello, Ron."

908
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,165
You don't even have a drink.
You just bugger off.

909
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:56,915
- Hello, Ron. Cheers, mate. Fuck you!
- What are you shouting at me for?

910
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,915
Because you had the world
on a string, yeah?

911
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,165
But you couldn't hold it together
so you fucked it up.

912
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:04,040
- Don't... Listen, you was away.
- I was in prison.

913
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:05,957
I had to make do with what I had.

914
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,082
You going Ron or Reg?

915
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,957
- Score?
- Mmm-hmm.

916
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:14,957
Reginald. He'll never go down
in front of the missus.

917
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:18,624
- You had everything, mate. You had it all.
- I didn't have you, did I?

918
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,957
- Reggie, please.
- It's all right, honestly. I got this. It's fine.

919
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:23,915
Yeah, actually, he's got this.
Thank you very much. He's a big boy.

920
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,624
We're talking about earning a living.

921
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,374
We're talking about being gangsters,
right, which is what we are.

922
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,874
- So you can just fuck off. Go on.
- Don't.

923
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,415
You know, one of these days, Ron Kray,
your miserable life will swallow you whole.

924
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,915
You should know all about that, because
I've heard all the stories. They're not good.

925
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:42,665
Your mum did palm us off
with the damaged goods, didn't she?

926
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:44,499
You're very, very damaged, aren't you?

927
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:45,915
All right, just get in the car.

928
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,707
- Don't ever speak to her like that again.
- Yeah, that's right, Frances.

929
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:52,165
Blood is thicker than water,
and I've been with Reggie since the womb.

930
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:55,374
Ron, shut up. I want you to apologise
to Frances right now.

931
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,165
- Right.
- All right.

932
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:00,374
Right, right. Frances.

933
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,374
I'm sorry, all right? Yes.

934
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,624
I'm truly very sorry
the club's very, very empty.

935
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:11,374
A bit like you, really. There's fuck-all in it,
apart from my brother's cock.

936
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,499
(Woman exclaims)

937
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,499
(Ron groaning)

938
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,874
You, all right,
are a fucking disgrace, mate.

939
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,499
You hit me.

940
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,499
Yeah.

941
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:44,582
(Groans)

942
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:47,582
- No! No!
- No, Ron.

943
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:48,915
No! No!

944
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:55,249
I fucking did, you fucking cunt!

945
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,457
(Glasses clinking)

946
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:00,582
(Ron) Fucking cunt!

947
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,124
(Woman screams)

948
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,707
- Fuck's sake!
- Not the bottle. Not the...

949
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:12,249
No! Not the balls!

950
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,374
(Reggie screams)

951
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,207
My fucking nuts! Wanker!

952
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:20,332
(Screaming)

953
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,374
Sweetheart, please leave.

954
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,249
Biting! Biting cunt!

955
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,582
- (Bones crunching)
- (Ron screams)

956
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:31,207
(Screams)

957
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,040
Ah!

958
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,374
Give me that.

959
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,332
(Panting)

960
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:44,415
Never mess with a man's jewels, mate.
What the fuck...

961
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:52,165
Now what are you doing?
No, Ron. No. No, no. That's a bottle, Ron.

962
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:55,624
- That's a bottle!
- I'll serve you up, you fucking cunt!

963
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,582
It's a bottle, Ron!

964
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,165
(Big Pat) That's enough.

965
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:02,249
- Pack it in. That's enough!
- (Ron screaming)

966
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,207
- I'm going to split them up.
- Shut up, mate.

967
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:05,773
Get back and sit down in your chair.

968
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,999
No. They're family.

969
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,874
Stay back.
Get out of the fucking way.

970
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,957
(Ron screaming)

971
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:13,582
(Big Pat) Put it down!

972
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,124
(Big Pat) OK, now, I told you!

973
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,749
- Come on, that's enough.
- (Panting)

974
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,915
(Groaning)

975
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:26,457
(Ron) No.

976
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,290
No.

977
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,874
- Enough, Reg, mate.
- (Ron groans)

978
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,374
(Ron) You just don't understand,
you don't...

979
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,082
Fuck.

980
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:39,582
You don't understand me.

981
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:43,082
That's probably 'cause I don't want to
fucking understand you right now, Ron.

982
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:44,582
I wanted to just, you know...

983
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:49,207
There's no point in
fucking explaining it to you, either.

984
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:53,290
It's fucking hopeless.
Come on, help me up.

985
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:55,332
Just help me out here, will you?

986
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,040
- That fucking hurt.
- All right, mate. What are you doing?

987
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,540
For fuck's sake, Ron.

988
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:04,249
Reggie, what I'm trying to tell you
is very simple, all right?

989
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,790
Listen.

990
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:12,124
I am very, very, very fragile,
myself.

991
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,374
All right?

992
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,374
Yeah, fragile, I've got it.

993
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,082
- Very fragile.
- I've got it.

994
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:19,499
(Sniffling)

995
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,582
All right, come on, now.
For fuck's sake.

996
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:31,332
I'm not myself, am I?

997
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,665
I mean, this isn't me. Is it?

998
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:36,582
This isn't us.
None of this is us, is it?

999
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,207
- I'm very sorry.
- It's OK.

1000
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,999
Are you done?

1001
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,499
Has she gone?

1002
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:48,582
- Yes, she's gone, mate.
- She's a keeper.

1003
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,790
She is. Thank you, Ron.
Thanks.

1004
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,665
(Honking)

1005
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:05,415
- There she is.
- Yeah, I got her.

1006
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:07,415
(Reggie) All right, stop here.

1007
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,582
That girl's gonna be the death of me.

1008
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:12,040
Mind how you go.

1009
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,332
(Reggie) Frankie. Frank.
Excuse me. Sorry.

1010
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,957
I need to have a word with you
about something.

1011
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,540
I don't care if you forget me.

1012
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,415
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

1013
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,582
You don't mean it.

1014
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,508
Don't tell me what I mean.
I know what I mean.

1015
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,832
Come on, Frances, please.
Can't we just start again?

1016
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,415
From the beginning, you know.

1017
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:32,165
We can get rid of everything that's bad,
and we'll just keep everything that's good.

1018
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:36,040
- What about Ron?
- What about Ron?

1019
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:38,082
He's not exactly a good bit, is he?

1020
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:41,124
Well... I mean,
he's not exactly a bad bit, either.

1021
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,790
- He was awful to me.
- Yeah, he was. But, you know, that...

1022
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:49,207
That's Ron. If he don't take his tablets,
he's like that. He's a nightmare.

1023
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,707
He's not always like that, you know.
He's got a heart of gold.

1024
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,540
He loves you to bits.
He thinks the world of you.

1025
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:56,306
Honestly, when you left,
he was in pieces.

1026
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,790
He was like, "Where's she gone?"
I said, "She's left."

1027
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:01,165
"Well, you better get after her
'cause she's a keeper."

1028
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,290
- (Chuckles)
- You are a keeper. So he's right.

1029
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,207
He said, "Tell her I'm very sorry."

1030
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:09,165
He is sorry and I'm sorry.
We're all sorry. But you know, that...

1031
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,874
That's what happens sometimes.
Families are stupid, aren't they?

1032
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,290
You know, they fight,
you know, they make up.

1033
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:17,957
And ultimately, you know, they stick
together 'cause they love each other.

1034
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,790
It's what they do.

1035
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:24,582
Don't tell me about forgetting you,
'cause that ain't happening, either.

1036
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,874
I spent the last six months
thinking about nothing but you.

1037
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,999
- So I get out and the club's gone up...
- All right. All right.

1038
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:33,040
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1039

(Frances) 'It was time for the Krays
to enter the secret history of the 1960s.

- Ronnie.
- Yes.

I regret that my answer is no.

1049
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,957
Nigeria is simply too far away

1050
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:15,249

in a thing I can't control personally.

1051

You are very well-informed, Teddy.

1061
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,624
Very well-informed.

1072
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:22,499

Good Lord,
that's Bob Boothby.

Yes, Prime Minister, sir.

At an orgy. (Chuckles)

1080
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:46,874
The Tories are going to have trouble
explaining this.

1081

Is that Tom Driberg?

1083
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,915
In fact, yes, sir.

There's no moral advantage to my party
if my party are also involved.

1085

- Cazenove Road, Hackney.

1087

What in God's boots
were they doing in Hackney?

1088
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:09,661
That's where it gets sticky.

1089
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:12,249
I thought the orgy was the sticky bit.
It gets stickier still?

1090
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:16,207
We've had two brothers, gangsters,
under surveillance. The Krays.

1091

The photographs
were taken in Ronald Kray's flat.

Orgies aside, we're tracking fraud,
protection rackets

- Eh?

1106

- You don't have to get me a present.
- Ah, that's ridiculous.

All right, well, just surprise me, then.
Surprise me.

I'll get you a sock full of coal,
you lucky thing.

What about that?

1111
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:11,749
What about it?

- Yeah.

'And what I shared with Ron was
needing pills to get through the day.

1335
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,999
'Sleeping pills helped sometimes,

1336
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:27,415
'other pills helped other times.

1337
01:17:27,541 --> 01:17:29,624
'They were like a friend
who held no judgement

1338
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:32,582
'and only wanted to be loved in return.

1339
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,415
'Mother's little helpers.

1340
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:36,457
'They were very well-named.'

1341
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,582
Don't go too fast.

1342
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:48,124
We're not going anywhere like too fast.
We're on the grass.

1343
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,665
- All right. Almost there.
- All right.

1344
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,415
- Bit more.
- OK.

1345
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:53,832
OK.

1346
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,249
- You ready?
- Yes.

1347
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:56,790
- Ready ready?
- Yes.

1348
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:01,124
Oh, my God!

1349
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,999
- Do you like it?
- Yes, what kind is it? What's it called?

1350
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:07,957
- It's a Triumph, a Triumph Spitfire.
- Can I get in?

1351
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:11,540
Yeah, of course you can, it's yours.
Happy birthday. There you are.

1352
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:15,582
- Happy birthday, Frances.
- Thank you.

1353
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:17,790
Will you teach me how to drive?

1354
01:18:17,916 --> 01:18:20,582
Uh... I can.

1355
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:24,040
- Now?
- Oh, not today.

1356
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:29,290
- Why not?
- Uh, I just... I can't. Not today.

1357
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:32,457
But I can tomorrow.

1358
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:36,415
- All right.
- Sorry.

1359
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:39,040
(Men singing)
♪ Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner

1360
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:43,124
♪ That I love London town... ♪

1361
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:47,165
(Leslie) Kray.

1362
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:49,207
- Kray.
- Kray.

1363
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:54,040
There's an inherent threat
in that one commanding syllable.

1364
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,707
It's the only word some need to hear.

1365
01:18:57,541 --> 01:18:59,540
What does that mean, "the only word"?

1366
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:02,165
Well, you're like Ford.

1367
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:05,957
Or Shell.
Or Woolworth's.

1368
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:07,499
Woolworth's.

1369
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:10,415
Yeah, that's very interesting.

1370
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:14,040
All I'm saying is Kray is a brand

1371
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:18,915
and an established reputation needs less
maintenance, less violence, you know?

1372
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:20,749
People fall naturally into line.

1373
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:23,332
Clubs are asking for our protection
before we even offer it.

1374
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:26,415
Yeah. That's true, actually,
they are. Yes.

1375
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:29,582
I suppose that would leave us
with less straightening out to do.

1376
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:31,749
- Exactly. That's right.
- Yeah.

1377
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,332
Makes sense.

1378
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:36,665
But I happen to like...

1379
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:39,207
I like straightening out,
you know, once in a while.

1380
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:41,499
Obliging someone in the old cobbles.

1381
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:42,874
What's wrong with that?

1382
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,499
I just think you could do better, Ron.
You know.

1383
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:49,540
It'll keep you out of prison, I mean,
none of us are getting any younger.

1384
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:52,040
You know, you need to leave
all this behind, I mean...

1385
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:55,082
You got to look to the future,
you and that lovely young wife of yours.

1386
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:57,040
(Ron) No! Fairy tales!

1387
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:58,749
That's fucking warning!

1388
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:02,499
This is a firm, right?
I'm a fucking face.

1389
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:05,374
I'll fucking serve you up,
you fucking cunt!

1390
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,207
- (Glass shatters)
- You're fucking bang out of order!

1391
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:11,415
I don't fucking like him, I don't trust him.
He asks too many questions.

1392
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:14,582
- I want him fucking dead!
- Leslie Payne, right, is our business,

1393
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:16,082
and you want him dead.

1394
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:19,290
- Have you been taking your tablets?
- Fuck tablets, right? Bugger tablets!

1395
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:22,082
Bugger Payne,
the fucking pain in the arse!

1396
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:23,415
And fuck his briefcase!

1397
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:27,082
I don't give a fuck what's in there,
I want to know what's going on up there.

1398
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:35,374
He knows too much about things.
Things about us.

1399
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,624
Reggie, he knows
too many things about us.

1400
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,707
He knows too many things about us?
Right.

1401
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:42,082
Albie,
do you know things about us, mate?

1402
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,790
Do you know things? Eh?

1403
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:46,415
About Ron, about me,
about the firm, right?

1404
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,415
You know about payments, right?

1405
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:50,124
You know we cash bearer bonds, yeah?

1406
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:53,665
D'you know we pay off juries to make 'em
look fucking favourably upon us, do you?

1407
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:54,999
Yes.

1408
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,874
You do. There's a fucking surprise.
Jack!

1409
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,707
Mate, do you know anything
about fraud?

1410
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,374
Anything at all? Take a punt.

1411
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,582
Do you know anything about
how we pay off policemen

1412
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:05,332
every fucking
final Thursday of the month?

1413
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:07,499
- Do you know that?
- Of course I do.

1414
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:10,207
(Reggie) Fucking surprise, that.
So why don't we kill Jack now?

1415
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,540
Or we do Albie as well?
We do the fucking lot.

1416
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,207
Or you can do me and I'll do you
and we're both fucking dead!

1417
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,707
That's a genius idea!

1418
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:20,665
Listen to yourself, Ron!
You're fucking nuts!

1419
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:22,915
Mmm.

1420
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:30,290
People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

1421
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:35,582
You know
I never drank gin till I came here?

1422
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:38,249
Oh, well, next you'll be singing
God Save the Queen, won't you?

1423
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:40,374
(Chuckles)

1424
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,999
What did you want to have
a word with me about, Mr Bruno?

1425
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:45,957
Things are going well,
we're very happy on my side of the pond.

1426
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:48,790
Well, that's good.
You know, we're very happy also.

1427
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:51,249
- OK.
- (Glasses clink)

1428
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,832
Cheers.

1429
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,749
Cheers.

1430
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:58,457
You realise I asked
to speak to you alone. Um...

1431
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:03,040
You see, in our line of work,

1432
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,915
it's not good to be famous.

1433
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:08,332
Anonymous is the goal.

1434
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:11,832
This Mr Lansky, Reg,

1435
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:14,290
he sees a lot of potential in you.

1436
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,290
But he sees limitations
in your brother Ron.

1437
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:18,957
Well, you know, maybe...

1438
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:21,999
Maybe they could just sit down
and meet each other, couldn't they?

1439
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:23,832
I mean,
he could come across for a chat.

1440
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,707
A chat? (Chuckles)

1441
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,499
You guys crack me up, really.

1442
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:31,415
You ever hear of the Gallo brothers?

1443
01:22:31,541 --> 01:22:32,999
- From Brooklyn?
- No.

1444
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,707
Similar loose cannon situation.

1445
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,874
You see, Ron is your Joey.

1446
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,999
And it's not gonna end well
in either case.

1447
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,124
(Sighs)

1448
01:22:45,708 --> 01:22:48,415
What exactly are you
asking me to do, Mr Bruno?

1449
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:51,832
I'm asking you
to do something about Ron.

1450
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,624
I can't do that.

1451
01:22:58,041 --> 01:22:59,915
He's my brother.

1452
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:03,290
OK.

1453
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:23,915
(Door opens)

1454
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:28,999
(Keys jangling)

1455
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:50,207
- There's nothing I can do.
- I ain't finished with you yet.

1456
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:54,374
- Mr Kray takes care of this warehouse.
- Now, you say Kray one more time...

1457
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:57,915
...and I'm gonna hit you, you understand?

1458
01:23:58,041 --> 01:23:59,441
I have an arrangement with Mr Kray.

1459
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:01,582
I didn't ask whether we had
an arrangement.

1460
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:04,582
I asked if you understood me.

1461
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:06,707
(Frances)
'The Richardson gang were away.

1462
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:11,790
'But George Cornell had crossed the river
to work a protection racket on their behalf.'

1463
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:14,415
I fucking warned you!

1464
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:17,999
(Frances) 'Ron's response would secure
his place in gangster legend.'

1465
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:19,915
What is that,
is that English breakfast tea?

1466
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:22,082
I can tell by your face, Ted,
what you think of it.

1467
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:25,957
- Lovely box, isn't it? It's beautiful.
- It's not English breakfast. That's not, no.

1468
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:28,790
That's got pheromones in it, that's got.

1469
01:24:29,791 --> 01:24:31,374
It's musky.

1470
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,957
That's a bit of magic, that is.

1471
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:36,665
That's very beautiful, innit?

1472
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:39,707
- I'm glad you like it.
- I do, that's proper.

1473
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:42,540
Me mum will be very,
very pleased with that.

1474
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:44,832
Did you have that away
from the old warehouse, did you?

1475
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:47,332
- Yeah.
- Don't say anything. It's all right.

1476
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:49,790
- Regards to Mrs Kray.
- Thank you.

1477
01:24:49,916 --> 01:24:53,165
- For the other matter.
- Yeah. What matter?

1478
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:03,832
That?

1479
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:05,999
- Yeah.
- All right.

1480
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:10,374
I mean, I'm not in the mind
to hand out refunds, am I?

1481
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,624
(All chuckling)

1482
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:15,999
Can't you handle it yourself?

1483
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:19,374
I pay you for protection, Ron.

1484
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:25,832
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing...

1485
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:28,582
No, you just said it.
You just fucking said it.

1486
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:31,540
You come in here
with your fucking nose, right,

1487
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:33,874
and your tea.

1488
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,957
Your fucking exotic tea.

1489
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:37,165
Right?

1490
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:39,165
And you say that.

1491
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:41,540
I'm not very good at my job.

1492
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:44,207
- I didn't mean it like that.
- You fucking did!

1493
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:47,082
- No, I... (Stutters)
- Ah!

1494
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,540
I'll tell you what.

1495
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:51,665
This matter of yours...

1496
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:55,249
- I'll deal with it for you. All right?
- All right.

1497
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,332
You go with Teddy, right,

1498
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,790
and you bring me £2,000, OK?

1499
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:06,624
And in return, I promise
that I will have George Cornell killed.

1500
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:09,249
All right?

1501
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:11,249
- I didn't say...
- All right?

1502
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,749
I didn't say
anything about killing, Ron.

1503
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,165
You fucking did.

1504
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:18,915
You fucking meant it.
Look at you, you meant it with your eyes.

1505
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:22,582
Look at your eyes. Eh?
It's in your fucking eyes!

1506
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:24,665
- Or are you threatening me?
- No.

1507
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,332
'Cause there's death in your eyes
and you're fucking threatening me!

1508
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:29,207
- Is he threatening me?
- It's hard to tell, Ron.

1509
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:30,415
- I'll pay.
- You'll what?

1510
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:31,624
- I'll pay.
- You will?

1511
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:34,374
- Yeah.
- There it is. And a deal is a deal.

1512
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,790
- It's done.
- Yeah.

1513
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:38,540
It's done. It's over.
Teddy, take him.

1514
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:41,040
Thank you.

1515
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:43,540
- That's very kind of you.
- Thank you.

1516
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,415
For the tea.

1517
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:49,957
That's a good deal.

1518
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:12,582
How do I look?

1519
01:27:13,291 --> 01:27:14,957
Fucking deadly.

1520
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,249
- Do you want me to come in with you?
- Hmm?

1521
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:20,540
In there?

1522
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:24,499
Come on.

1523
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:27,040
You all stay in the car.

1524
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:31,249
- (Door closes)
- Anything you need to tell me?

1525
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:40,499
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

1526
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:43,374
- (Woman screams)
- Jesus!

1527
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:48,915
Yeah, you're not laughing now, are you?

1528
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:51,999
(Ian) For fuck's sake.

1529
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:55,040
Boss, the fuck...

1530
01:27:57,208 --> 01:27:58,457
(Barmaid screaming)

1531
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:00,415
Get the fuck down!

1532
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,290
Don't say a fucking word!

1533
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:04,249
What are you fucking looking at?

1534
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:05,790
You didn't see nothing!

1535
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:10,207
(Breathing heavily) Fuck.

1536
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,707
That's Ronnie Kray, that, isn't it?

1537
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:15,207
Fucking hell.

1538
01:28:29,458 --> 01:28:30,499
Reggie.

1539
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:32,957
Are you mad?

1540
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:38,332
The Blind Beggar? Yeah, Cornell?

1541
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:39,707
It's on the fucking radio.

1542
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:41,665
Reggie.

1543
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:43,665
Hi, Mum.

1544
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:47,665
Oh. Thank you.

1545
01:28:47,791 --> 01:28:50,707
Oh! Look at you.

1546
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,374
Look how handsome you are!

1547
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,915
- I'll get you a cup of tea.
- Thanks, Mum.

1548
01:28:59,041 --> 01:29:01,415
- Albie?
- I'm all right, Violet, thank you.

1549
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:09,665
You do look lovely, Reggie.

1550
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:12,707
How many witnesses?

1551
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:15,040
It was a quiet night.

1552
01:29:15,166 --> 01:29:17,082
- Seven?
- Seven?

1553
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:21,082
Albert Woods was with Cornell.
Plus five regulars, don't know them.

1554
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:24,457
And the barmaid, the blonde, the one
with the big fucking pair of eyes.

1555
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:25,957
For fuck's sake.

1556
01:29:26,083 --> 01:29:28,457
And you bring this here?
You bring it straight to Mum's?

1557
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:31,082
Don't moan about it, all right?
It's done, innit?

1558
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:33,624
What are we gonna do, hmm?

1559
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,707
- (Reggie) "We"?
- Yeah.

1560
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,415
Where's the weapon?

1561
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:45,415
It's here, Reg.

1562
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:50,332
There you go. Now...

1563
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:52,790
- Here, let me have it.
- (Mother) Would you like a piece of cake?

1564
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:55,540
Do you know what? That would be lovely.
Yeah. Thank you, Mum.

1565
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:58,874
- It is, it's lovely.
- (Mother chuckles) Thanks.

1566
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:03,165
I assume you were
in those clothes, right?

1567
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:05,624
Yeah, yeah.

1568
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,415
So where's his jacket?

1569
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:08,749
Right, you need to burn that.

1570
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:11,395
And that gun, we need to toss it
in the river right fucking now.

1571
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,082
Go on, fuck off.

1572
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:20,790
You are...
You're unbelievable.

1573
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:23,457
Albie?

1574
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:26,165
Whoever was in that pub,
we need to find out who they are,

1575
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:29,415
get hold of them and just unravel
whatever they've said to the police.

1576
01:30:29,541 --> 01:30:32,207
We need to undo, so get Big Pat,
Bender, send them down there now.

1577
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:33,874
- The barmaid I know, right?
- You know her.

1578
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,374
Well, bring her to me,
I'll deal with her myself, all right?

1579
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,540
Go on. Fuck off.

1580
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:39,832
Oh.

1581
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:41,790
Where's everybody gone?

1582
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:45,173
Oh, Mum, it's late, it's late.
I wanted them out of your hair, you know.

1583
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:47,415
You should get some bed time.

1584
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,290
Why don't I give you a lift home?
Come on.

1585
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:52,707
- Oh, it's all right, I am home.
- (Chuckles)

1586
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:56,207
I've made a bed up for him.
He's not well.

1587
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:58,124
He's...

1588
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,874
He's got a fever.

1589
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:03,082
- (Sniffs)
- He's going to stay here the night.

1590
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,249
Teddy, would you like to stay with him?

1591
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:12,790
Thank you, that'd be very nice.
Thank you, Violet.

1592
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:21,290
Whatever he's done,

1593
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:24,082
he's your brother.

1594
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:28,582
Yeah.

1595
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:35,374
Yeah.

1596
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:37,915
Well, um...

1597
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,290
Here's your Stemetil, mate.

1598
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:44,999
You should take that.

1599
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:50,082
Do you know what?
I'm going to have to go, actually.

1600
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:54,415
'Cause, um, I left the lads at work
and I have to clean up.

1601
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:57,665
So, I'm going to say goodnight.

1602
01:31:57,791 --> 01:31:58,832
Goodnight.

1603
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,790
Teddy, now, you couldn't do us a favour,
could you? Be useful.

1604
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:09,874
And when you take his trousers off tonight
and his shirt, can you burn them?

1605
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,707
Yeah? And check in with me.

1606
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:13,665
- Yeah.
- Good lad.

1607
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:16,457
(Reggie) Night-night.
(Mother) Goodnight.

1608
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:17,707
Goodnight, Reggie.

1609
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:25,540
- He's lovely, isn't he?
- (Mother chuckles)

1610
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:34,707
(Frances) 'Not even Scotland Yard
could ignore murder on the streets.

1611
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:36,915
'Nipper was back on the case.'

1612
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:39,165
Gentlemen, your attention, please.

1613
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:44,332
Now, you've been told that we're
conducting a high-level investigation

1614
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,790
into a major corruption allegation.

1615
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:53,165
In fact, we're going down into the sewer
after the Krays.

1616
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,457
Any man with any objection,
come and see me.

1617
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,374
See that lamppost up there, right?

1618
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,332
That was known as a safety point
during the war, right?

1619
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,040
So, if you could run to that lamppost,

1620
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:12,415
you knew that you could make it
to the air raid shelter

1621
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:14,457
before the bombs started dropping.

1622
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,082
One night, right, me and Ron,
we just stood there and we watched.

1623
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,124
We saw the old Stanton house
get blown to bits, they were still in it.

1624
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,124
It's a wonder you lived through it.

1625
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:29,915
Yeah, yeah,
especially with Ron, you know.

1626
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:33,665
Every time trouble came on top, he was
always dragging behind, wasn't he?

1627
01:33:33,791 --> 01:33:36,665
He's got plenty of trouble now,
if the stories are true.

1628
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,457
I heard it on the street, Reggie.

1629
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:43,082
My own family and you didn't tell me.

1630
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:45,915
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want you to worry, did I?

1631
01:33:46,041 --> 01:33:47,624
I don't worry about Ron.

1632
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:50,207
- What do you plan to do about it?
- I'm not gonna let him go to prison.

1633
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,999
- Why not?
- Why not?

1634
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:55,415
Why not? Because he's my brother,
that's why not.

1635
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:57,124
He'll still be your brother in prison.

1636
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,874
No.

1637
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,790
No, Frances, look, he belongs here, right?
He belongs with us.

1638
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:04,957
He belongs with you, me and his family,
this is his home, all right?

1639
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:08,457
I've been looking after Ron since we were
little boys, it's just the way it is.

1640
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:10,999
You can still look after him in prison.

1641
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,582
And he doesn't belong here
and you know it.

1642
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:16,249
Right.

1643
01:34:17,541 --> 01:34:19,790
Right, well, you just don't understand.

1644
01:34:19,916 --> 01:34:21,249
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

1645
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:24,249
Yes, I do. You once told me
you don't owe the world a thing.

1646
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,582
Well, you don't owe Ron a thing, either.

1647
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:30,832
My loyalty for my brother is how
I measure myself, do you understand?

1648
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:33,332
What about your loyalty to me,
is that not a measure?

1649
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:37,915
So... what is going on
with your eyes right now?

1650
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:41,249
Are you on something?
Are you taking something, Frances?

1651
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,790
Are you taking pills again?
Let's have a look.

1652
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:45,374
- Oh, hello. Look at that.
- Stop it.

1653
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,832
Jesus Christ, how many
of these things are you on?

1654
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,249
No wonder you're not making any sense.
You're a pill popper.

1655
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:53,290
- And who made me that?
- What? A pill popper?

1656
01:34:55,666 --> 01:34:57,749
So, let me get this straight.
What you're saying is that

1657
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,832
in order for us all to be free, yeah,

1658
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:02,165
that we all have to be on our own?

1659
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:06,415
That's great, Frances.
Let's just... I'll go with that.

1660
01:35:06,541 --> 01:35:09,582
- Listen, talk to that barmaid.
- Yeah?

1661
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:11,874
Tell her when they line the suspects up
across from her

1662
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,249
to point her finger at Ron
and say, "That's him.

1663
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,249
"That's the mad hatter what done it."

1664
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:17,957
All right?

1665
01:35:19,041 --> 01:35:21,415
- Where are you going?
- Home.

1666
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,582
- What about me mum?
- Fuck your mum!

1667
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:52,707
- (Nipper) Take your time.
- No.

1668
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:55,540
The man who shot Cornell,
he's not here.

1669
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:57,874
Are you sure?

1670
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,249
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure.

1671
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:03,540
Please, could someone
just take me home?

1672
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,290
Miss.

1673
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:21,999
- (Donoghue) I swear to God.
- (All laughing)

1674
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:24,749
I smelt something,
I don't know what I smelt.

1675
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:27,415
There were some good funny looks
in the room towards the judge.

1676
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:31,207
A bit stinky, he was.

1677
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:33,749
Right?
Am I right or am I wrong?

1678
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,665
- No. No.
- Shh.

1679
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:37,957
Just goes to show,
you can give a dog a bad name,

1680
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:40,457
but when that dog's name is Kray,
it might bite you back. Well done.

1681
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:42,374
Well done, Ronnie.
Justice is served.

1682
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,165
- Mea culpa. Mea culpa. Eh?
- Drink to my little bunny.

1683
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:46,624
Welcome home.

1684
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:48,249
(Ron) Maxima.

1685
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:49,832
It's discipline.

1686
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:52,415
(Charles) Come and sit down, Vi.
(Mother) No.

1687
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:55,457
- (Leslie) Give her a pink wafer.
- (All laughing)

1688
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:04,415

1689
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:09,582
(Gasps)

1690
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,290
What did you tell her?

1691
01:37:20,166 --> 01:37:23,915
I just said, "You might want to think
about your children." You know?

1692
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:29,165
I wish I could make you go away.

1693
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,999
Well, good luck with that, Frances.

1694
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:34,207
Yeah. Good fucking luck with that.

Still survive these days.

1711
01:38:34,833 --> 01:38:36,582
See you later, Albie.

1712
01:38:39,166 --> 01:38:41,415

- Yeah, go on.

You all right?
Look like you're struggling there.

1714

Help me.

1715
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:51,082
Help you?
What are you doing?

1716
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:53,040
Help me put the top on.

1717
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:56,082
- Oh, I'm not sure I can help you.
- Reggie, please, it's going to get ruined.

1718
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:59,165
I can't, can I? I'm a club owner.
You know what I mean?

1719
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:02,749
I can pick a nice model, all right,
in a nice colour,

1720
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:05,582
but I'm not very good at anything else.
I'm not a mechanic, am I?

1721
01:39:05,708 --> 01:39:09,249
I'm more of a... a gangster,
isn't that right? Yeah?

1722
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:10,415
Please help me.

1723
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:12,832
Please help you?

01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:16,374
"Please, Reggie."

1726
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:20,249
All right, let's help you, then.
Go on, then.

1727
01:39:20,375 --> 01:39:21,582
How's that?

1728
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:24,374
It looks a bit
fucking fucked to me, mate.

1729
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:26,915
Speaking of...

1730
01:39:28,083 --> 01:39:30,290
You look like shit and all.

1731
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:42,832
Yeah.

1732
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:09,749
(Door closes)

1733
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:17,707
What are you doing?
Reggie, stop it!

1734
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:19,374
Stop it!

1735
01:40:20,416 --> 01:40:22,040
(Panting)

1736
01:40:24,708 --> 01:40:25,790
Reggie!

1737
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:31,165
- Eh? Stop what?
- Please stop. Please stop.

1738
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,999
- Reggie, please stop. Please stop.
- Stop what?

1739
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:35,540
Please, no!

1740
01:40:35,666 --> 01:40:37,832
(Screaming) Please! No!

1741
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:39,582
Stop it!

(Ron) ♪ Life goes on without me

1743
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:56,457
Where are you going?

1744
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,832
I'm leaving Reggie.

1745
01:40:59,958 --> 01:41:03,082
Oh, that is a shame,
he will take that very hard.

1746
01:41:03,208 --> 01:41:05,415
Please get out of my way, Ron.

1747
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:07,707
Unless you prefer me to stay.

1748
01:41:09,875 --> 01:41:12,165
All right, boys, go upstairs. Go on.

1749
01:41:16,083 --> 01:41:17,957
Would you like me
to help you with your bags?

1750
01:41:18,083 --> 01:41:20,374
- No, thank you.
- Oh, come on. Don't be daft.

1751
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:23,040
Look at the size of you,
look at the size of me, come on.

1752

Come on.

1753
01:41:24,833 --> 01:41:28,165
You know, Frances,
sometimes to achieve greatness,

1754
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:30,749
you do, you have to cut off
a little piece of yourself

1755
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:33,582
no matter how much it hurts,
in order to grow, in order to move on.

1756
01:41:33,708 --> 01:41:36,582
It takes courage
and I admire that, you know?

1757
01:41:36,708 --> 01:41:39,749
To be honest,
I think you're getting out just in time.

1758
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:42,415
- You think so?
- Absolutely, yeah.

1759
01:41:42,541 --> 01:41:44,749
There's so many people
who know so much about us.

1760
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:47,665
Not you, of course. You know.

1761
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:50,332
Most people hate us.

1762
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:55,457
Sooner or later, someone's going to talk
and that'll be it, it'll be over.

1763
01:41:55,583 --> 01:41:57,415
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

1764
01:41:57,541 --> 01:41:59,290
Mmm.

1765
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:03,582
I think God ought to cut us
some slack, though, don't you think?

1766
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,540
Yeah, I'm sure God will.

1767
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,249
That is, uh...

1768
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:13,540
That is bang out of order.

1769
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:16,457
That's not how we were brought up,
not at all.

1770
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:18,415
Ron, I've got to go.

1771
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:21,999
Yeah, course you do.
Listen here, Frances, right?

1772
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:25,624
We both love him, all right?

1773
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:28,124
We both made the effort.

1774
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:31,499
So we shall just have to see
what happens when we get there.

1775
01:42:33,916 --> 01:42:35,499
Where?

1776
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:38,582
Heaven.

1777
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,249

1779
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,332
Goodbye, Ron.

1780
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:49,832
Bye, Frances.

1781
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:52,749
Listen here,

1782
01:42:53,958 --> 01:42:57,290
I always liked you, Frances,
I always did.

1783
01:42:58,333 --> 01:43:02,249
'Cause you have the ability
to see into the future.

1784
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:03,999
You do.

1785
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:06,999
And that's the same as me.

1786
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,832
Bye, now.

1787
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:56,082
All right, Reggie?

1788
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:57,999
How are you?

1789
01:43:58,125 --> 01:44:00,582
Yeah. You all right, Frank?
Long time no see, eh?

1790
01:44:00,708 --> 01:44:02,790
- I've been walking straight, you know.
- Oh, yeah?

1791
01:44:02,916 --> 01:44:05,374
- Yeah.
- That's nice, innit?

1792
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,957
That's nice.

1793
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:09,749
What can I do for you?

1794
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,374
Frances here?

1795
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:17,540
It's just that I've been outside your
parents' house the last couple of weeks.

1796
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:21,124
And they hadn't told me
that she left, so, you know,

1797
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:24,332
I've been standing underneath
her window like a fool.

1798
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:28,999
- Yeah, she's here.
- Yeah, I know.

1799
01:44:30,791 --> 01:44:33,040
- Reggie...
- What?

1800
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:38,749
I haven't seen her like this
in a long time.

1801
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,249
She's delicate.

1802
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:42,999
Right. All right.

1803
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,415
You tell Frances to come out here
'cause I had to come out here.

1804
01:44:45,541 --> 01:44:48,082
- Why don't you just go and get Frances?
- I'm not letting you see her.

1805
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:50,582
- Don't fuck about!
- Frank?

1806
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:52,582
Frances, get back inside.
What are you doing?

1807
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:53,915
It's OK.

1808
01:44:54,041 --> 01:44:55,665
Hi, Reggie.

1809
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:57,915
Hello, Frances.

1810
01:44:59,833 --> 01:45:01,082
Have you got a moment?

1811
01:45:02,458 --> 01:45:03,707
Let's have a little chat.

1812
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:06,082
- It's all right.
- Are you sure about this?

1813
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:09,582
Go inside and put the kettle on.

1814
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:14,832
Frankie, come home.

1815
01:45:15,708 --> 01:45:17,290
I am home.

1816
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:20,582
At least until I find somewhere else.

1817
01:45:20,708 --> 01:45:22,707
I can't go and live with my mum.

1818
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:26,457
What can I do to change your mind?

1819
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:29,165
You can't.

1820
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:32,957
I've changed my mind
about one thing, though.

1821
01:45:33,083 --> 01:45:34,415
What's that?

1822
01:45:35,291 --> 01:45:37,540
I do want you to remember me.

1823
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,332
Always.

1824
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:43,749
That I existed,
that I once walked beside you.

1825
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:45,082
What are you on about?

1826
01:45:46,083 --> 01:45:47,707
Frankie, come on.

1827
01:45:48,541 --> 01:45:49,874
I always imagined, you know,

1828
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,207
I thought that we might have
a child or two, you know.

1829
01:45:53,416 --> 01:45:56,290
Why? So you could use them
to threaten me?

1830
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:57,957
No.

1831
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:00,374
No, because I still love you.

1832
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:02,874
No.

1833
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,374
