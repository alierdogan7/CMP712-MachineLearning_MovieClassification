1
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,153
Eternal and Almighty God

2
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,240
You make the deaf hear.

3
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,151
You make the mute speak.

4
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,240
You send your son to us

5
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,153
to help us fight against Satan

6
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Enabling mankind

7
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,240
To part from darkness, and enter the light.

8
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,153
Bless this child.

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Deliver him from sins 

10
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,240
and shine because of you.

11
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,153
May the Holy Spirit be with him

12
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,151
Yann

13
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,153
In the name of Father, Son...

14
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,151
and the Holy Spirit

15
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,151
I baptize you.

16
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Do you see?

17
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,240
His eyes are like your dog's.

18
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,153
Father's water...it's too cold.

19
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Don't disturb him.

20
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Wait.

21
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Wait.

22
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,153
I have something for him.

23
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Nice, huh?

24
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
.357 Magnum.

25
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I bought it from an arms dealer.

26
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Aim for the stomach, then the head.

27
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,151
You won't miss.

28
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,240
I want to carve a skull on the butt.

29
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
What do you think?

30
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Put it away, this is the wrong place.

31
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Isn't this a little soon?

32
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Why? How can man not have a gun?

33
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,240
First religious rite, then rite of passage.

34
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
The baptism of gun fire.

35
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,153
Jerry, don't!

36
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,153
Shit, do you see that?

37
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,240
- You like her?
- No.

38
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Do you or don't you?

39
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,153
Y-y-yes I like...

40
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,151
Isn't she pretty?

41
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Want to get on the truck with her?

42
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
For five minutes.

43
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,153
Just the two of you.
Yes or no?

44
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240
She gets excited when she sees a uniform.

45
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
She's completely deaf.

46
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,153
Whatever you say doesn't matter.

47
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
That's disgusting!

48
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,153
You wet your pants! 
Shit.

49
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,916
Man, change your clothes.

50
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,958
It doesn't pay to wear a uniform.

51
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Out!

52
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,151
Not out.

53
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
- It's out!
- Out?

54
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,240
How could you tell, it's a meter away?

55
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Pitbull scores, now serves.

56
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,240
That crow is so noisy

57
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,240
what does he know about being a referee?

58
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Forget it, it's a foul.

59
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,151
I don't care.

60
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,151
15 - 0

61
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Give him a lesson.

62
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,153
Somebody pretends to be an expert again, 
I'll show him.

63
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
I can't take these Nazis.

64
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Then go buy some balls.

65
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,240
These guys are taking a holiday.

66
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,240
You think this is cool?

67
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,152
Did you not see them play tennis?
You still think that they're cool?

68
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
They are nuts.

69
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
That little lice-headed idiot

70
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
He took out his gun

71
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,240
and blew the tennis ball away!

72
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
They're being watched.

73
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
He will meet up with them.

74
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I've said it a hundred times,

75
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
this feels like a dream.

76
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
But it wasn't a dream.

77
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,152
I've seen it.

78
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Who's the one holding the dog?

79
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Don't know, got here last night.

80
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
What kind of dog is that?

81
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Pitbull.

82
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
No, this isn't a Pitbull.

83
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I am Jacky, also known as Pitbull.

84
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,240
An expert in combat and robbery.

85
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,151
With an axe.

86
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
With an axe?

87
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
They seem to be all there.

88
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Seems like it.

89
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
He's Mosquito?

90
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
No, he's Pitbull.

91
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
That's Mosquito, he's very tense.

92
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
He's a priest?

93
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
I'll tell you one thing

94
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
watch out for Mosquito, he's trigger happy.

95
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Do you ladies give handjobs?

96
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,153
Not everyone gets to torture these
fifteen-year-old addicts.

97
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,153
Strange, my hands smell like meat.

98
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
This is the famous Dobermann?

99
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,153
He is the famous Dobermann.

100
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,240
They seem like serious drug addicts.

101
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
They're all alike.

102
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Drugs will hook you; break you.

103
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
It's the trend.

104
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Once I start, these clowns are dead meat.

105
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Of course.

106
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,240
But you won't start.

107
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Cristini, you're out.

108
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
There are so many complaints about you.
It's like a mountain.

109
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,153
Go home, let us do our job.

110
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,151
Yes, sir.

111
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Shouldn't he call?

112
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
That's not his style.

113
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Do we have an answering machine?

114
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
In case he calls while we're playing.

115
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
That makes sense.

116
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,153
If he doesn't call, we don't have to wait.

117
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Why are you painting?
We leave in 3 days!

118
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,240
What happened to this house?

119
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,151
You want to know?

120
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,240
A decent young man

121
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,151
Broke

122
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,153
So he uses a shotgun to end his problems.

123
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,151
His wife,

124
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,151
3 children

125
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,151
and himself.

126
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,151
Goddamn it!

127
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,240
The blood is making me sick.

128
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
It's all over my ceiling.

129
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,240
I can't sleep at night,
because children are crying.

130
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Why doesn't he go for the right people?

131
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Without faith, man goes mad.

132
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Without faith?

133
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,834
Without money.

134
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,153
You're dead.

135
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,151
I know.

136
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
My sister...

137
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,153
Let go, it's my sister!

138
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Are we moving again?

139
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,151
I guess so.

140
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
How about some coffee to wake up?

141
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,240
I don't drink coffee.

142
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
There should be beer in the refrigerator.

143
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
They are so beautiful

144
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,153
They're identical twins.

145
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Great, just like that

146
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
I'll help you put the knife back

147
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,240
My lovely younger sister.

148
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,151
Pony, stop messing around.
You want to be castrated?

149
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,151
She is my sister!
My sister!

150
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Shut up.

151
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,151
Help me to press the car.

152
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,153
Shit, why don't you get
a garbage man.

153
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Probably because of the legend.

154
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,153
I don't care about no legend.

155
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
- Pony.
- What?

156
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Don't sell it.

157
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,151
Come here.

158
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
You miss me?

159
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
I miss you all the time.

160
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
You want your car pressed?

161
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Are you asking me?

162
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:60,240
Do you have any weapons?

163
00:15:60,480 --> 00:16:03,153
No, there's no time.

164
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,240
He's sick.
That will leave marks.

165
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Do you want to commit robbery?

166
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,153
This is a big deal

167
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
I need thirty men

168
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Get Big Nose, Torpedo
and the Matthew Brothers

169
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
- All of them?
- Right.

170
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
- There's a lot of them.
- Right.

171
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
When?

172
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,153
Tomorrow, go now.

173
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
- Hello?
- <Asshole, jerk!>

174
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
- Oh, it's you.
- <Are you coming?>

175
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
- Not this weekend.
- <Why?>

176
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Why? I just can't.

177
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
<You think I'm a fool?>

178
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,240
I didn't say that I 
think you're a fool.

179
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
- I just have things to do.
- <Excuses.>

180
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Do you understand?

181
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
<This is your kid>

182
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
I know

183
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
I get him the next two weekends

184
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,240
- <Next week and the one after.>
- Really?

185
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
It's a deal.

186
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,240
- Bye.
- <Call me tomorrow.>

187
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,151
That woman's a drag.

188
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,153
That idiot came to
the wrong place!

189
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,151
Calm down.

190
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Stop taking drugs

191
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
It makes you tense.

192
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,151
Let me.

193
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Do I look suspicious?

194
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Tense?

195
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
I'm not tense, are you tense?

196
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,151
No.

197
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,353
Priest, you came out without backup?

198
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,519
What's that?
A halo?

199
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,631
Nat the Gipsy.

200
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,917
Hello princess.

201
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,119
We were expecting you.

202
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Thank you for all these gifts.

203
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,151
Right, thanks.

204
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,240
What did you rob?

205
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,240
I didn't rob, I made
an investment.

206
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
It is so convenient to
cheat with sign language.

207
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Would you teach me?

208
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
You rob and let us wait.

209
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,153
Thank you for the invitation.

210
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,151
What?

211
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
How long has he been like this?

212
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
He's been bored for weeks.

213
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,153
He dreams of robbing banks.
The pillage...

214
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,240
He thinks that policemen
have become an illusion.

215
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,240
I am thinking with a new perspective, 
about subtle differences.

216
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
He forgets what age he's in.

217
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
He isn't cautious of technology.

218
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,240
He sees a security camera,
he yawns.

219
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
How about Cordell?

220
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
What about electronic cashiers?

221
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240
How will you rob these?

222
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,151
Fax machine?

223
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Yann, tell him to face reality.

224
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,240
We can't deal with him.

225
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,153
Not only are banks modernized

226
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,153
Sunny gave me a laser-guided
machine gun.

227
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,240
This is a small missile.

228
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,153
No door can stop this.

229
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
After breaking into the bank,

230
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,153
the shock wave will pin
everyone to the wall.

231
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,153
The shock wave of the rocket

232
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,151
Beautiful.

233
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,151
It's Christmas.

234
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,153
There is the scent of Christmas trees.

235
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
It's Cordell.

236
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Sir, there's news from the villa.

237
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
A man and a woman showed up

238
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
They all left together

239
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,152
I'll fill you in later.

240
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
My God...

241
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
They're moving.

242
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,240
They all left the villa.

243
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Him...he must be Dobermann!

244
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Who's checking out who?

245
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Casey, Dushey, Noby

246
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,240
They are tracking the car.

247
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Lucky, let's keep it that way.

248
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Tell the mobile team to stand by.

249
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,240
Wait, aren't you rushing it a bit?

250
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
They might be going bowling.

251
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
Don't rush it.

252
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Taking three cars to
the bowling alley?

253
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,240
They must be robbing a bank.

254
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,153
We should move out.

255
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,240
You got your license
in kindergarten.

256
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
What?

257
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,151
Come here.

258
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
If I go down, take care of Nata.

259
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,240
She wouldn't pay attention to me.

260
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Don't let her be foolish.

261
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,151
What?

262
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,151
Ooh, a blonde...

263
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
What?

264
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
I mean you look good in a wig.

265
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
If you laugh, I'll kill you.

266
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
I'm putting it away and changing

267
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Going home to my parents this afternoon

268
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,240
It's only a birthday, don't worry.

269
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
I'm not worried.

270
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,153
Call me, I'll come meet you.

271
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
What do your parents think you do?

272
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,153
Studying law.
You should see me in my black gown.

273
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,151
Goddamn faggot.

274
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
I want to go with you.

275
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
We're robbing a bank

276
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Goddamn duty officer

277
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Why do you put on this
kind of make-up?

278
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Those girls who get arrested

279
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
always look sloppy in the papers.

280
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
So what?

281
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
She does it on purpose

282
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
to set an example.

283
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
For example, they may say that you're gay.

284
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Be careful!

285
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Are you nuts? Shit!

286
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Are you coming, baby?

287
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
This is such a mess!

288
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
Let's go.

289
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Your woman is really deaf?

290
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Mosquito, aren't you 
wearing a mask?

291
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,153
I like to see my face
in the newspaper.

292
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Who else is on this one?

293
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Leo, Pony, Big Nose, Torpedo
and the Matthew Brothers

294
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,240
They're all here?

295
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,240
You got a bunch of clowns.

296
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Nobody's laughing.

297
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
See you tonight!

298
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,153
Don't forget,
today is my birthday!

299
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,151
East station.

300
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,153
I don't know what it is.

301
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
What is this shit?

302
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Fox 3 calling Z1, over.

303
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
This is Z1, come in Fox 3.

304
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,240
A Mercedes with 5 passengers

305
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
leaving exit No. 3

306
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,153
heading toward the Louvre.

307
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Fox 4 calling Z1, over.

308
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Fox 4, come in.

309
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,240
Funny, the traced car
just came out.

310
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Driver is female.

311
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Keep tracing!

312
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Sebastian Street, armed robbery

313
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Republic Plaza, armed robbery

314
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,240
National Square subway entrance

315
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,153
Montpanas,
Beret Street Business Center

316
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Your plan worked.

317
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,240
There are never enough cops
to go around.

318
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,153
What next?

319
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Claude, this is a trap.

320
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Mind your own business.

321
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,240
They went straight to Defont Street.

322
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
We have to go now.

323
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Don't think that Cristini is right?

324
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
All the police are dealing with
robberies. They are phantoms.

325
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
There are no cops left to deploy.

326
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Not one!

327
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
There's bound to be one real
phantom

328
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
I do not want to miss,
understand?

329
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Are you coming?

330
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,153
I set the time and place
for this kind of massacre.

331
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Let's go.

332
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
It's a beautiful little prank.

333
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,153
They must be dreaming if they
think that they can catch them all.

334
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Fox 4, calling Z1

335
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Fox 4 calling Z1

336
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,153
Fox 4 calling Z1

337
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Fox 4, come in.

338
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
The woman in the Lamborghini

339
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
has just stopped the vehicle
at the Olympic Hotel

340
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Awaiting instruction.

341
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Fox 4, awaiting instruction.

342
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,153
Isn't this a good opportunity
to show off?

343
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
You deal with the driver of the Lamborghini.

344
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
I'll tell the commissioner the good news.

345
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
The end of Dobermann.

346
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Fox 4 can move out...

347
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Claude's men are useless.

348
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,719
We are back at war.

349
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,076
Unless they can kill Dobermann.

350
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,155
What kind of chance do they have?

351
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Must you drive so fast?

352
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,153
You don't know
where you're going!

353
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,153
Fuck! She loves explosions!

354
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
This is Fox 1.

355
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Come in, over.

356
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Sebastian Street bank
has been robbed.

357
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Fox 1, get ready.

358
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
Hurry!

359
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,153
My eardrum is about to break.

360
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Miss...

361
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Marx, did you see that?

362
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Bank, bang!

363
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,240
You call him Marx?

364
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
I loved his movies
when I was a kid.

365
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Bought all the tapes.

366
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,153
They're hard to find nowadays.

367
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Z1, report your current position.

368
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Don't stop, keep moving!

369
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,153
Don't be rash,
there are too many men.

370
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
We've sealed off all escape routes.

371
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
They can't get away.

372
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,153
Can't get away?
This is full of holes, a trap.

373
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,240
They're leaving.

374
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
David, keep up!

375
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
What are you doing? Faster!

376
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,240
Wait! They're slowing down.

377
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,153
They aren't robbing another bank?

378
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,153
They're stopping at...the front
of the Union Bank

379
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,434
Don't move!

380
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
What are they doing?

381
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,151
Sir...

382
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,153
Sir...I'm too old.
I can't get down.

383
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
It's alright, you can stand up.

384
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,240
- What?
- You can stand!

385
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,153
What, I'm busy!

386
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
I'm busy!

387
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
<Why don't you pay the rent?>

388
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,240
I just came to get 500 francs.

389
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
<You forget the rent!
You forget your child!>

390
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
No I did not.

391
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
<I have a bounced check!>

392
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,240
<I don't want to bounce checks!
You owe me 30,000 Francs!>

393
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
-Huh?
- <Thirty thousand, are you deaf?>

394
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Who do you think you are?

395
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
The queen of France?

396
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,153
Take it, we aren't theives!

397
00:31:60,080 --> 00:32:01,117
Go to hell!

398
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,151
At last.

399
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,151
Good, let's go.

400
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,153
Calm down, calm down.
Just wait.

401
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,151
This is a trick.

402
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Trick? What trick?

403
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Two people are staying inside the bank.

404
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,153
They'll come out to drive a different vehicle.

405
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
No, they won't come out.

406
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Damn it!

407
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
They tricked us!

408
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Z1 calling all Foxes.

409
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Clear all the exits.

410
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Don't act without my command.

411
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Repeat: follow my orders.

412
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,240
I don't need a hostage situation.

413
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
If the people in the car signal,

414
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
the robbers inside will come out.

415
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,153
Then we move in, got it?

416
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
It's going to get fucked up.

417
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
No, there are only two of them.

418
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
There are six of us,
and we're in the dark.

419
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,151
Let's go.

420
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Shit!

421
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,151
It's me.

422
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,153
This is your first time.
Do not take the gate.

423
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,151
Asshole!

424
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,151
Don't move!

425
00:34:60,240 --> 00:35:02,153
Don't worry, it's no problem.

426
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,153
Take that, cop.

427
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,151
Don't...

428
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Well?

429
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,356
His head ruined my gun!

430
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,153
I don't like masks.

431
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
- Hello.
- <Yann, cops.>

432
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
We're still inside bank.

433
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
We'll be right there.

434
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,153
We have to go back. Cops.

435
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Leo, the one on the motorcycle.

436
00:35:60,240 --> 00:36:01,151
The one on the motorcycle!

437
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,151
Shit!

438
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
Shoot, quickly!

439
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,151
Shoot!

440
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Where is he?

441
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
The invisible rider

442
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,153
The messenger from hell

443
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,151
Shoot him!
Hurry!

444
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Goddamn cops!

445
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Helmet!

446
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Faster, priest.
Grenade.

447
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,151
No!

448
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,240
His light will shine on you

449
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
He's holding on!

450
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,153
He will make you stronger

451
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,240
You call out to God, 
he shall accept you.

452
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
You shout.

453
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,153
He'll say...

454
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,151
I'm coming.

455
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,240
What is this? Blood?

456
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
It's the rider's. It's stuck.

457
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,240
Doesn't matter.

458
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,240
It's not the rider's,
there's hair.

459
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,240
It's Marx's.

460
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
What are you doing?

461
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Give me his gun, I want
this to look like suicide.

462
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
Good idea.

463
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
What does this bitch want now?

464
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
- Hello?
- <It's Yann.>

465
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Sorry, I thought it was
my wife again.

466
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
<There are cops everywhere.>

467
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
<Hold on, we'll be right there.>

468
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
It's Yann. He's coming back for us.

469
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Great, there's still a ton
of cops out there.

470
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
- I'll take care of them.
- Wait!

471
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,240
Use that guy as a shield.

472
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
<Move it, we're here.>

473
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,153
Come on, let's go.

474
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Hey! You idiots.

475
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
Put down your weapons.

476
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,151
Very good...

477
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,151
Slowly

478
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Great

479
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,151
Come on, cops...

480
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Give me the gun!

481
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,151
Thank you, sir.

482
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
I am collecting guns.

483
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Taxi's here!

484
00:38:60,240 --> 00:39:01,151
Let's go.

485
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,151
Roy

486
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,750
I said this wouldn't work.

487
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,240
We have won.

488
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
They have lost.

489
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Not bad.

490
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,151
Marx?

491
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
Where's Marx?

492
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Sorry.

493
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,240
I opened the door, he ran out.

494
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,240
What? Then let's look for him.

495
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
Cops will be here any minute.

496
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,240
I don't care, I want my dog!

497
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Wait! Pitbull!

498
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Let me go, or I'll kill you!

499
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,153
Here is Marx.

500
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,240
A cop on a motorcycle was shooting at us.

501
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,240
God has punished him

502
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,240
He is beheaded and gone to heaven.

503
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
What?

504
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,153
He means we blew his head off.

505
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,240
I'll give him the best grave

506
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,153
The best grave for any dog.

507
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
Then I will skin these cops alive!

508
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,151
Sure.

509
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
Of course.

510
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,151
Fuck!

511
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,240
There's twice the bread

512
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,240
and cheap drinks

513
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Want hot sauce?

514
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,240
No hot sauce, mustard.

515
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,240
The woman left the hotel.
She's dressed like a man.

516
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
A lesbian in men's clothes?

517
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,151
Yes, sir.

518
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
It's someone we know.

519
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
You remember Olivier?

520
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
The prostitute named Sunny?

521
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
That's him.

522
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,240
Look what I've found in the car.

523
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,240
That bitch and Dobermann are together.

524
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,240
Fine, where is she now?

525
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
Her parents' house,
around the corner.

526
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,153
Good, let's go find her.

527
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,151
Aren't you eating?

528
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Act casual. 
They're Fox 4.

529
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,240
Tell them to get lost.

530
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,153
Go, let's go.

531
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Has the commissioner assigned you?
Really?

532
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Son of a bitch!

533
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
Go away!

534
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,151
Leave me alone!

535
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,151
Goddamn it.

536
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,151
Shut up! Get lost!

537
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,957
Do you understand?

538
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
She's bleeding

539
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:60,240
Police!

540
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,151
Call the police!

541
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
This is exciting!

542
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,151
I love it.

543
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,153
It's delicious, Mom.
But too much.

544
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,240
You're too thin,
eat a little more.

545
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
You didn't mention anything
about school.

546
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,240
There is nothing to say.

547
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,240
When can you start working?

548
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,240
It's not easy being a lawyer.

549
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,440
You have a wife and family

550
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
We can't always take care of you.

551
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,240
Now, we can.

552
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,240
Leave him alone.
Let him study.

553
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,240
You eat, I'll get the door.

554
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Are you expecting anyone?

555
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,240
Who are you?

556
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,151
Police.

557
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,151
The Police.

558
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,151
Sit.

559
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,151
Hello, Sunny.

560
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Can I call you Sunny

561
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
In front of your family?

562
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,240
I'll call you Olivier.

563
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
Do you know them?

564
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,540
You want to talk, we can
go somewhere else.

565
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,240
Why?

566
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,240
Isn't it better in front of
the family?

567
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,240
Why does he call you Sunny?

568
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,240
Why don't you speak?

569
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,153
What are you doing with Dobermann?

570
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,153
Robbing banks for fun?

571
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,240
We cannot so despise money.

572
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
We must respect money...

573
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,240
But Dobermann

574
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,240
Dobermann deserves to die,
and be buried six feet under.

575
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,153
I don't know what
you're talking about.

576
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,240
I am talking about Dobermann!

577
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,151
Calm down.

578
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,153
This is a waste of time, right?

579
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,240
You're doing all right, Sunny

580
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,240
Must be, driving a fast car.

581
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
Is that car yours?

582
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
You must give thousands
of blowjobs,

583
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,240
To be able to buy this car.

584
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,240
Something normal people
are incapable of.

585
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,153
We found this in the car.

586
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,240
This is what we are
more familiar with.

587
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,153
You don't mind your son getting
his prick removed?

588
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,153
Your son giving blowjobs all day.
Don't you mind?

589
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,153
What? Asshole!

590
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,240
Your mother is not polite.

591
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,240
Tell them they are wrong.

592
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,240
Tell them!

593
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Right.

594
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,240
Say we have the wrong place.

595
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,240
Say it, say it!

596
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,240
They're here for me.

597
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,240
I'm not a law student,
I'm a prostitute.

598
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,240
Shut up!

599
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,240
I won't.

600
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
You want me to become a lawyer,

601
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,240
I've made it halfway.

602
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,240
Mother, you don't have to
feed me medicine anymore.

603
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,153
I'm always farting because
of anal sex.

604
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,240
Good job, Sunny.

605
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,153
You would rather ruin your family...

606
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:60,153
The show must go on.

607
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,240
You even have a child.

608
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,240
You have both sexes.

609
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,240
To fuck and be fucked.

610
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,240
Where's Dobermann?

611
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,153
This child will say
that papa is a faggot.

612
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,240
I love kids

613
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,151
I mean it

614
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
I want to have my own

615
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,240
We'll get along fine

616
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,240
We can play for hours.

617
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,153
But there is no time now.

618
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,151
Julie!

619
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,151
Don't move!

620
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
Put the child back.

621
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,240
See what you are forcing me to do?

622
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,240
Just to protect one asshole.

623
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Where is he?

624
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
I'll kill the child
if you don't tell me!

625
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
I'll beat your wife!

626
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,153
What were you thinking?

627
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,153
Are you still dreaming?

628
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,153
Such a pity,
especially on his birthday.

629
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,240
Really?

630
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,153
Today is his birthday?

631
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,151
That makes a difference

632
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,240
I hate to ruin birthdays.

633
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,153
Even if the birthday boy
is a queer.

634
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:13,153
Everybody should get a present.

635
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,240
Here you go, baby.

636
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,151
Don't.

637
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,151
Don't!

638
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,151
Don't...

639
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
You should have seen how
I blew his head off!

640
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,240
That cop is gone.

641
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,240
From the telescope

642
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,240
It looks like a movie.

643
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,153
Pity, no slow motion replay.

644
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,240
But cops all have hard heads.

645
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,153
We tried to kill him, but failed.

646
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,240
Can you pray for my dog?

647
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,151
Kill him!

648
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,240
All the teeth?

649
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,151
O.K.

650
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,240
I'm leaving.

651
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,151
So soon?

652
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,151
Goodbye, everyone.

653
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
Mosquito.

654
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,240
Mosquito!

655
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,240
- You want me to stay here with you?
- No.

656
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,240
You have a date with Sunny?

657
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,240
I want to get my money first.

658
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Call Sunny before you go.

659
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,151
Why?

660
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
Don't you think that
the cops are moving fast?

661
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
There are cops everywhere.
Isn't that part of your plan?

662
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,240
Are you happy about
killing two cops?

663
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,153
I can't just sit there,
waiting to die.

664
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,153
I'll call him.

665
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,151


666
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,151
God,

667
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,153
Ride father's horse.

668
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,240
- Hello?
- <Hey, it's Mosquito!>

669
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,240
It's you.

670
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,240
<No, it's the Pope.
How is my car?>

671
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,240
Just fine.

672
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,240
<You sound strange.>

673
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,153
The elevator's broken.
I'm out of breath.

674
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,240
<Any problems?>

675
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,240
No, no problem.

676
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,240
<Your parents still there?>

677
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,240
They're washing dishes.

678
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,240
<Such a warm family.>

679
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,240
Why do you say that?

680
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,240
<Nothing, it's a family thing.>

681
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,153
- <'Bye>
- See you tonight.

682
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,240
So?

683
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,240
They're going to Joey's tonight.

684
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:03,153
Beside the canal.
The club with a skull.

685
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,151
You're going too

686
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,240
Looking lovely, wearing a smile.

687
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,240
I can't...

688
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,151
Yes, you can.

689
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,240
My man is a good cop.

690
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,240
But he has no patience with children.

691
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,240
Don't worry,
it'll be great tonight.

692
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,240
You'll be breathtaking.

693
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,151
The queen of the club.

694
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,151
Champagne!

695
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,240
The delivery man
will be here after noon.

696
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,240
- What? 
- The delivery man will be here after noon!

697
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,240
What?

698
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,240
Just one problem.

699
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,240
Speak!

700
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,240
We have to kill the duty officer.

701
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,240
Is that a problem?
You think this is a problem?

702
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,240
No, I can help you kill
the duty officer.

703
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,240
There are two of them.

704
00:55:60,240 --> 00:56:03,153
Then I will kill two people.

705
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,240
I love this, Victoria!

706
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,240
Robbing banks is great

707
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,240
Killing cops is great

708
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,153
- Blow me!
- No problem.

709
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
Nature is so corrupt.

710
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,240
What did he say?
What did you say?

711
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,240
Nature is so corrupt
and loves no one.

712
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,240
- What is corrupt?
- Nature.

713
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,240
It's only lions eating zebras.

714
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Zebra? 
You don't know what a zebra is.

715
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,240
I know it when I see it

716
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,240
Here, there is a big zebra.

717
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,240
The biggest in the world,
still eaten.

718
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,240
What is this shit?

719
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,240
Why don't you get a real woman?

720
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,240
What's the difference?

721
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,240
Sunny said she fucked all of you.

722
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,240
What is he saying?
I'll hit him in his stupid mouth!

723
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,240
Calm down.

724
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,240
You've got a woman,
stop complaining.

725
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,240
I've never fucked a man.

726
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,153
Hey, a mouth is a mouth!

727
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,240
Fuck! How much longer do we 
have to wait?

728
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,151
He's not coming.

729
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,151
He'll come.

730
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,152
I don't believe it, he's nuts.

731
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,151
He's not crazy.

732
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,153
Before I reached the age of one

733
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,240
He gave me my first gun.

734
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,240
So what?

735
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,240
That's Uncle Joey.

736
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,151
Let's go.

737
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,153
- What?
- There are cops everywhere.

738
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,240
Stop being paranoid.

739
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:34,153
You always think there are cops
everywhere.

740
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,240
Not tonight.
I feel something horrible.

741
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,151
Let's get out of here.

742
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,553
What are you waiting for?

743
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,240
Don't touch me like this.

744
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,240
You're blind.
I'm not blind, I'm only deaf.

745
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,151
I know...

746
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,240
Shoot the girl first.

747
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,240
What?

748
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,153
Headquarters calling Luna 1.

749
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,240
This is Luna 1, over.

750
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,153
Commissioner says it's urgent
that he speaks with you.

751
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,240
You cut the radio?

752
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,240
After I get rid of Dobermann,
the Commissioner will thank me

753
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,151
Asshole.

754
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,151
Kiss my ass.

755
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,240
What is this?

756
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,240
If there are cops,
the alarm will show.

757
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,240
Put that gun away.

758
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,240
Why hide the gun if it's a cop?

759
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,151
Come on...

760
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,240
How are you, Mosquito?

761
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,240
Next week, my darlings, 
I'll be going to...

762
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,151
New York

763
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
When you see me again

764
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:43,153
I'll have a little pussy

765
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,153
and a huge clitoris!

766
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,240
He's here!

767
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,240
I can't believe we've found him.

768
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,240
Don't shout, it will make the child tense.

769
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,240
Tell the Commissioner to
send all units.

770
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,240
Why not ask for the air force?

771
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,240
I don't know
what you're thinking

772
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,240
But I know what 
these devils are plotting.

773
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:21,240
I am still going to
call the Commissioner.

774
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,153
Shut up!
You pest.

775
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,240
You could have captured Dobermann.

776
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,240
Two men are dead
because you're afraid.

777
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:37,552
Shut up or go back, O.K.?

778
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,429
They are like fine game

779
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,030
Tastes better when it's a little rotten.

780
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,911
One more

781
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,240
and another.

782
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,240
Smoke some pot.

783
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,151
Shoot up.

784
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,153
Let them play

785
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,153
Let them get stoned.

786
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,240
We'll wait by the door

787
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,240
and catch them one by one.

788
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,153
Like ripe fruit falling from the trees.

789
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,240
You hid your drugs in your bullets?

790
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,153
Cops would never look in there.

791
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,240
Good idea.

792
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,151
Take that.

793
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:23,240
This may kill you.

794
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,240
You didn't remove the detonator!

795
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,240
Why remove it?

796
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:31,153
Yeah, why remove it?

797
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,240
What do you think about me?

798
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,240
With you, I feel like a woman.

799
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,240
You're handsome.

800
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,153
Don't look at me like that.

801
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,240
What? What's the matter with you?

802
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,151
Don't you feel well?

803
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,151
Come...

804
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,151
It stinks.

805
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,240
Who farted in here?

806
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,240
The kid just took a dump.

807
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,240
Go change him, it stinks!

808
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,240
What?

809
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,240
Someone was showing a gun
in front of me

810
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,240
I came to dance, not to see guns.

811
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,240
- It's Pony.
- That's right.

812
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,240
Others would complain too

813
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,240
Get back on stage, I'll handle it.

814
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,240
I'll be right back.

815
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,151
Right?

816
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,153
Happy Birthday, Sunny.

817
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,151
This is fun.

818
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,151
Yann!

819
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,151
Thanks.

820
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,240
What's wrong with you?

821
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,240
I have to take a shit.

822
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,240
Someone's in the toilet.

823
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,240
I can't wait!

824
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,240
When I can't hold it, I have to go!

825
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,240
Then go outside and take a shit.

826
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:52,240
- Outside? Fuck you and outside!
- Yeah, now's the time.

827
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,240
I'll show you my shit.

828
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,240
A group of lunatics.

829
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,240
What can you do with
these morons?

830
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,153
They are the best.

831
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,153
What are you doing?

832
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,240
I'm gonna shit in the canal.

833
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,240
He's not going to piss over us.

834
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,240
Who is he?

835
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:27,240
Don't know.
He's desperate.

836
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,151
He's not pissing.

837
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:34,153
What is he doing?

838
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,151
All right...

839
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,240
Shit, the kid!

840
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,151
Stop! Police!

841
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,151
Damn...

842
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,153
I thought you tied her up!

843
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,151
Damn!

844
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,153
Baby, it's alright.

845
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,151
Degenerate!

846
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,151
Shit!

847
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,151
No.

848
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,151
You go down. You, go up.

849
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,153
Take him back to the car.

850
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,151
Yann, hurry!

851
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,153
They shot my dick!

852
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,153
Police! Get down!

853
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,153
I can't see!

854
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,151
Shit, the drugs!

855
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,791
Damn it!

856
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,156
Go ahead! We'll show them!

857
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,272
I'll call the Commissioner.

858
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:47,153
Welcome to reality, baby.

859
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,240
That way. Careful!

860
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,151
Almost there.

861
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,153
- Where's Dobermann?
- Didn't find him.

862
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,153
Why did the music stop?

863
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,240
Why did the music stop?

864
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,153
Get up, moron!

865
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,240
This way, we'll be safe.

866
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,240
That's the old escape route.
It leads to the parking lot.

867
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:35,240
When it's quiet, we can leave.

868
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,240
There's enough beer to
last two weeks.

869
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:40,340
I have to go look for my bird.

870
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,240
What is that? 
A security device?

871
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,240
No...

872
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,240
If it's a video camera,
they'll be right on our tails.

873
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,240
Invisible, the wall is full
of security devices.

874
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,153
Completely soundproof, very private.

875
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,153
You know any good place?

876
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,240
Piece of shit!

877
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:21,240
Don't break it, I don't have any more.

878
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:23,240
- Can you pray?
- I don't know.

879
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,740
- Pray.
- Shit, what are you doing?

880
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,240
Don't shoot, I have hostage!

881
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,240
Please don't shoot!

882
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,240
- We're coming out!
- He's crazy!

883
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,240
Put down your weapon, or he dies!

884
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,153
They're together!

885
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:51,153
May the Lord be with us.
Almighty Lord...

886
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,151
Stop praying. Get in the car.

887
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,151
Get in, hurry!

888
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,240
Sir, Officer Bowman.

889
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,240
What about Bowman?

890
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,240
His head has been blown off!

891
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,151
Good!

892
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:32,153
Sunny, you're beautiful.

893
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,151
Kiss me.

894
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:54,153
Can I retreive the transmitter now?

895
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,153
Get this snitch out of here.

896
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:07,153
No, it's not like that...

897
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,240
I will put a swastika
on your grave.

898
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,240
We'll discuss decoration later.

899
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,240
Take them up first

900
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:22,153
Make them talk.

901
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:40,153
Strange, everyone got busted.
How did you get away?

902
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,153
You know the rules.

903
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,153
Tell Yann, it was for the baby.

904
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,240
Let's go.

905
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,240
No...

906
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,151
Wait, wait!

907
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,240
You have to.

908
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,240
No, I can't die.

909
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,240
Forget about my little brother.

910
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,240
Pay no attention to what I'm saying.

911
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:45,240
Can't get arrested for a poke.

912
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,240
You're pissing blood.

913
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,240
Stop talking about piss.

914
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:54,240
Don't make me scold you, it hurts.

915
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,151
It's O.K.

916
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:02,240
Remember our first robbery?

917
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:07,240
The post office on Duke Street?
We ran out, and then...

918
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,240
A police car came,
I was going to surrender.

919
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,153
You'd already drawn your gun.

920
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,240
What did I do?

921
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,240
You shot those bastards.

922
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,240
That's right.

923
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,151
Those sons of bitches.

924
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,240
You told me...

925
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:33,153
What did I tell you?

926
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,151
What did I say?

927
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,240
You said: "Don't let the bastards get you."

928
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:44,240
You're better,
and you have better weapons.

929
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:48,153
You're not going to hand me over?

930
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,151
Pony...

931
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,240
He's not going to make it.

932
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:04,153
Look, it's Nata and Pitbull.

933
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,240
Jacky Sueur
a.k.a.
Pitbull

934
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:17,240
Yann Le Pentrec
a.k.a.
Dobermann

935
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:21,240
They are all villains.

936
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,240
Jean-Claude Ayache, Mosquito!

937
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,240
Elie Frossard, the Priest!

938
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,240
Have you heard of them?

939
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:33,240
Tell me which team

940
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,240
I may remember.

941
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,240
What kind of sport do they play?

942
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,153
Here's a picture
of you and Dobermann.

943
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,240
You want my autograph?

944
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:48,240
Isn't this your mark?

945
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,240
You all have it.

946
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,151
I like dogs.

947
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,240
The drug charge alone
will get you 15 years.

948
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,240
More than that.

949
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,240
Much more.

950
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,240
The dead officer, head of family.

951
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,240
I came for a friend's
birthday party!

952
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,240
Her name is Sunny, ask her.

953
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,240
Her? Do you also not know her?

954
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,240
On her shoulder, she's got
the same tattoo as you.

955
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,240
You don't know her?

956
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,240
You must know Dobermann.

957
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,240
He is your boyfriend.

958
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,240
Poor fool

959
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,240
He got away,
you got prison for life.

960
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,240
You're still young.
It's a long road.

961
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:33,240
A very long life ahead of you.

962
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:37,153
With no one to depend on,
you think he'll wait 20 years?

963
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,240
What's that mean?

964
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,240
I get it.

965
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,240
You get what?

966
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,151
Go to hell!

967
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,240
Bitch!

968
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:50,240
You have nobody to lean on.

969
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,240
Your Nazi brothers all ran away.

970
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:56,153
Only the two of you left.

971
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,871
Bastard!

972
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,240
Sorry, David.

973
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,240
Include the cleaning bill
on your expenses.

974
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,153
This man is sick,
he should be put away.

975
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,151
There.

976
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,390
Shit, Pony...

977
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,036
No.

978
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,111
Wait. Wait!

979
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,240
Young, there are cops outside.

980
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
You take care of Pony,
at least until tomorrow.

981
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,117
Don't let them get him.

982
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:29,153
- I told you to stop!
- Get lost.

983
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,240
Stop it, you're insane!

984
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,151
Get lost!

985
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,240
Go!

986
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,151
Shit!

987
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,240
Cristini.

988
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,240
Cristini!

989
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:57,240
What kind of joke are you playing?

990
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:01,153
Shit! Watch out.

991
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,151
Cristini!

992
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:16,153
I'm going to fuck his woman

993
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,151
Watch.

994
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:23,153
You lose!

995
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,151
You lose, do you hear me?

996
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,153
You want to mess with me?

997
01:28:37,237 --> 01:28:38,151
Fuck you!

998
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,151
Let's see

999
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,153
Who's the boss.

1000
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:04,153
I'll fucking kill you!

1001
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:12,153
Son of a bitch, I got you now.

1002
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,151
Come on!

1003
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,151
Fuck you!

1004
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:44,153
Fuck you, you hear?

1005
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:49,240
Tonight we chop off cops'
heads for free!

1006
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,151
For Leo!

1007
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,151
For Bulldog!

1008
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,151
For Pony.

1009
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,151
Alive.

1010
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,151
I'm alive.

1011
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,117
God...

1012
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,117
Our lives are short and fragile.

1013
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,240
Death reminds us of this.

1014
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,240
But you are everlasting.

1015
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:48,240
Your love is greater than Death.

1016
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,240
We hand our brothers...

1017
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,840
and our sisters to You.

1018
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,592
Forgive her sins

1019
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,111
So that You may protect her

1020
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,989
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

1021
1:31:60,240 --> 01:32:01,240
Amen.

1022
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:42,153
This kind of burial is suspicious.

1023
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:47,153
You want the real thing?
