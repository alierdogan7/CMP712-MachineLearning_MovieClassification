00:22:47,666 --> 00:24:11,474
Alain.

183
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,261
[Russo] Our friend's name is Boca,

184
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,934
Salvatore Boca. B-O-C-A.

185
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,466
They call him Sal. He's a sweetheart.

186
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:31,175
He was picked up on suspicion of armed robbery.

187
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,173
Now, get this. Three years ago,

188
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,973
he tries to hold up Tiffany's in broad daylight.

189
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,980
Could have got 21/2 to 5, but Tiffany's wouldn't
prosecute.

190
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,017
Downtown they're pretty sure he pulled off a
contract

191
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,688
on a guy named DeMarco.

192
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,686
[Doyle] What about his old lady?

193
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,689
Her name's Angie. She's a fast filly.

194
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,726
She drew a suspended for shoplifting a year ago.

195
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,058
She's only 19 according to the marriage license.

196
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,063
19 going on 50.

197
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:58,597
What else?

198
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,338
He's had the store a year and a half.

199
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,131
Takes in a fast 7 grand a year.

200
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,139
What's he doing with two cars and $100 tabs?

201
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,709
The LTD's in his wife's name.

202
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,515
The Comet belongs to his brother-- Lou.

203
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,413
The Comet belongs to his brother-- Lou.

204
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,078
He's a trainee at the garbage man school on
Ward's Island.

205
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,721
He did time a couple of years ago.

206
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,616
Assault and robbery.

207
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,190
The black Cadillac.

208
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,430
Uh, New Jersey plates.

209
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:29,133
RWN 264. I know that one cat.

210
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,459
We saw him outside the Pike Slip Inn.

211
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,465
l want to get a blouse like that for my
girlfriend,

212
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,467
but I want you to model it.

213
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,503
Better not let my husband hear that.

214
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:42,179
I don't care if he hears it. Will you do it?

215
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,505
Okay. How much you going to pay?

216
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,546
- $50 an hour.
- 50 an hour?

217
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,549
- I’ll do it-- 200.
- Nah. Can't afford it.

218
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,984
I’ll call you later. Bye-bye.
It's 1:30. I didn't expect you till 2:00.

219
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,228
- You work around here?
- Yeah. Across the street.

220
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,967
- That's the third time he come here this week.
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,671
You got anything on this building?

222
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,200
The building's clean. l checked the tenant list.

223
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,910
Remember Don Ameche, the actor? He lives here.

224
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,236
Oh, yeah. And somebody else.

225
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,277
Does the name Joel Weinstock ring a bell?

226
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,282
- Oh, you're kidding.
- No, sir. He lives right here.

227
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:25,489
He was the bank on a shipment out of Mexico
three years ago.

228
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,757
Yeah, so I hear.

229
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,267
He's going to Ward's Island. We'll be spotted
there.

230
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,604
Maybe he's going to see his brother.

231
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,939
- Shit.
- Maybe it's another drop.

232
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,083
He gets a free ride.

233
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:15,303
Put your hands on your heads. Turn around.

234
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,335
All right, Popeye's here!

235
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,132
Get your hands on your heads,

236
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,811
get off the bar and on the wall.

237
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,569
Move! Come on, sweetheart, move.

238
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,905
Come on, move it!

239
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,376
Face the window!

240
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,585
- Move!
- Turn around!

241
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,048
Hands out of your pockets.

242
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,086
- Come on.
- Turn around. Get on the wall.

243
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,987
Turn around. Hey, you drop that? Pick it up.

244
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,322
- Get those hands up!
- Pick it up!

245
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,692
- Come on, move!
- What are you looking at?

246
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,698
Bring it here. Get your hands out of your
pockets.

247
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,372
- What's my name?
- Doyle.

248
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,370
- What?
- Mr. Doyle.

249
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,735
Come here. You pick your feet?

250
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,606
Get over there. Hands on your head.

251
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,745
We told you people we were coming back.

252
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,476
We'll keep coming back until you clean this
bar up.

253
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,020
lf your neighbor drops something of yours--

254
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:11,159
What is this, a fucking hospital here?

255
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:11,690
Turn around there, fella.

256
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,625
What's this? This belong to you?

257
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,299
Huh?
Stand up there, Noddy.

258
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,102
Get your hands on your fucking head.

259
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,105
You want to take a ride, fat man?

260
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,038
Oh, bullshit.

261
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,576
Huh?

262
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,282
Pay attention.

263
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,280
We're going to ask questions later.

264
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,485
Turn around.

265
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,227
All right, shut up there.

266
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,127
Shut up!

267
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,893
Anybody want a milk shake?

268
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:01,435
All right, come over here.

269
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,874
You. And you.

270
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:07,880
Hey, whiskers! Come over.

271
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,916
Move ass when l call you!

272
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,287
Come on, you, baldy. Come on, move.

273
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,689
Put it on the bar. Get it on the bar!

274
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,395
Get the hell in there. Hands on your head.

275
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:23,623
All of it.

276
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,665
Smart-ass, you dropped something. Pick it up.

277
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:33,771
You want that hand broken? Get it up there.

278
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,910
What else you got in here, huh?

279
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,713
Turn around.

280
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,713
You're under arrest. You too.

281
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,749
Get in that phone booth.

282
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,182
Move. Move!

283
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,857
Get in there.

284
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:52,426
Put your hands against the wall and lock
yourself in.

285
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,799
Hey, you! Haircut!

286
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,797
Where are you going?

287
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,062
You talking to me, baby?

288
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,204
Yeah, I’m talking to you. Come here!

289
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,636
- What's happening, baby?
- Where you been, huh?

290
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,311
- I've been in there.
- You stand a toss?
- I’m clean.
- You use shit?

291
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,250
No, man. Who are you, Dick Tracy? l said l was
clean.

292
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,884
- Will l get stuck?
- No, I’m clean.

293
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,020
lf l do, you know what happens.

294
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,918
I’ll kick your motherfucking ass.

295
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:27,187
Hey, I’m clean. In where?

296
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,955
Gimme a nickel, man. Come on. Gimme a nickel.
Come on!

297
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:33,193
I’m clean. Why the fuck you want to come
down on me?

298
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,768
Oh, come on.

299
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,098
Goddamn cops aingt worth goddamn shit.

300
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,572
Everything's everything, baby.

301
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:44,712
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff's
all milk.

302
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,713
There aingt nothing around. Nobody's holding.

303
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,046
Got a name for you. Sal Boca. Brooklyn.

304
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:52,289
B-O-C-A.

305
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,991
Never heard of him.

306
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,193
What about his wife Angie?

307
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,898
Doesn't register. There's been some talk.

308
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,430
- About what?
- A shipment.

309
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,896
Coming in this week or the week after.

310
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,934
Everybody's going to get well.

311
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,040
- Who's bringing it?
- Who knows?

312
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,708
Oh, shit.

313
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,546
- Where do you want it?
- Huh?

314
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:51,839
Whew.

315
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,548
Where do you want it?

316
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:27,121
Oh, shit. This side.

317
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,998
Son of a bitch! Damn!

318
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,165
I’m going to check on this address in the Bronx.

319
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,494
lf they don't know you, it's your ass.

320
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,604
Get your hair done before Saturday.

321
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:46,070
We're going now. Good-bye.
Move ass.

322
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,545
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.

323
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,118
not out there in Ridgewood.

324
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,479
Detach us then, give us a shot.

325
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,418
At least till we learn if there's anything here.

326
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,856
This might be the lead we need to get Weinstock.

327
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:09,899
You couldn't burn a three-time loser with this
garbage.

328
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,901
The first thing you know,

329
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,263
you'll get an entrapment rap, both of you.

330
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,939
Brooklyn is loaded with guys

331
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,937
that own candy stores, two cars,

332
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,273
Put this candy store hustler together with
Weinstock,

333
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,982
maybe we got a big score.

334
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,980
Big score! At best he's selling nickel and dime
bags.

335
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,311
l wouldn't be infringing on your coffee-break

336
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,748
if I thought he was a nickel-and-dimer.

337
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:37,016
Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle. Or
have you forgotten?

338
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,126
Jesus Christ, Jimmy,

339
00:31:39,397 --> 00:34:42,169
what's happened to you guys lately?

340
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,395
Every year you lead the narcotic bureau in
arrests.

341
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,070
Was it over a hundred again last year?

342
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,401
A high school kid in shorts with a twitch?

343
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,074
You grab a bellhop

344
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,403
because he's got three joints in his sock.

345
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:03,181
We got the information there's no shit on the
street, right?

346
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,945
It’s like a desert full of junkies out there,

347
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,185
This could be it! This candy store guy

348
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,896
puts on a big show in a fancy nightclub

349
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,222
with known narcotics connections. They were all
over him.

350
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:17,229
Then on our own, we tail him to Brooklyn

351
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,938
and sat on him practically a week.

352
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,264
Who do we come up with? Joel Weinstock.

353
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,270
Now, you got to let us have it.

Uh, yes.

00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:16,859
Why did you choose to come by ship?

367
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:21,565
The next several weeks will be very difficult
for me,

368
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,892
and the middle of the ocean is the only place

369

where the telephone isn't ringing all the time.

370
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,897
Do you agree with a recent survey finding

371
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,939

01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:08,001
Nothing but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves.

699
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:15,042
Nothing in there except a New York City map.

700
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,039
Are you bullshitting me?

701
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:19,041
That car's dirty.

702
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:22,078
Take it in and tear it apart.

703
01:25:56,317 --> 01:26:01,345
Tear it right out. Tear it out!

704
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:05,454
Nothing here, Jimmy.

705
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:13,791
Look in here.

706
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:26,972
[Coughs]

707
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:36,153
This is all solid.

708
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:13,451
There's nobody been under that car
since it came from the factory.

709
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:17,460
That thing is clean.
I don't buy that, IRC.

710
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,158
The stuff is in that car.

711
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:24,929
Well, you find it. l can't.

712
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:37,549
[Mumbling]

713
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,383
[Speaking French]

714
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:45,387
Look, the car was lost some time last night.

715
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:49,061
First, they send us to Pier One,

716
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:52,428
l don't understand why you parked down by the
waterfront.

717
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,429
You're staying in Midtown Manhattan,

718
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:57,432
and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?

719
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:00,401
Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a
French film.

720
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:03,406
He probably left the car to look at something.

721
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:07,842
The police commissioner said the car was brought
to this garage.

722
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:12,749
You'll have to be patient. We get 400, 500 cars
here a day.

723
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:15,784
Monsieur Devereaux is a very important guest of
this country.

724
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:19,458
He's working with the absolute cooperation and
participation of your government.

725
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:22,491
Here are his credentials from the French
consulate.

726
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:27,167
Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in
his film,

727
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:29,164
I suggest you locate the car immediately.

728
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:30,165
You're in a no-smoking area, sir.

729
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:32,599
Will you please extinguish your cigarettes?

730
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:51,390
What was the weight of the car

731
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,388
when you got it, Irv?

732
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,932
4,795 pounds.

733
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:10,403
You sure?
That's what it was-- 4,795 pounds

734
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:14,743
when it came into the shop.

735
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:18,281
The owner's manual says 4,675.

736
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:21,987
It’s 120 pounds overweight.

737
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,152
And when it was booked into Marseille,

738
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:29,829
it was 4-7-9-5.

739
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:33,590
That's still 120 pounds overweight. Jimmy's
gotta be right.

740
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:39,163
Listen, l ripped everything out of there, except
the rocker panels.

741
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:41,601
Come on, Irv, what the hell's that?

742
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:05,293
Shit!

743
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:09,297
Son of a bitch.

744
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,868
All right.

745
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:23,278
Got it for you, Randy.

746
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:26,281
It just came in from downtown. Who's Devereaux?

747
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:31,423
- l am. Why?
- I’m sorry, Mr. Devereaux.
But we get lots of cars here at night.

748
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,319
You mean the car is here now?

749
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:36,085
Yeah, it's right outside.

750
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:39,128
They stole it right off the street, huh?

751
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,230
Goddamn!

752
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:43,902
You're going to have to pay the towing charge.

753
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:47,699
l was told these things happen in New York, but
one never expects it.

754
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:51,467
Well, that's New York. Is this your first trip
here?

755
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:52,268
Yeah. Where's my car, please?

756
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:54,310
It’s right over here.

757
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:56,312
But you're lucky this time.

758
01:30:56,584 --> 01:31:01,351
It’s in perfect shape, not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.

759
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:23,966
Henri.

760
01:31:29,217 --> 01:31:30,707
[Speaking French]

761
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:03,347
- Let's go!
- Bon voyage.
Merci.

762
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:05,652
l would give you a ride, but--

763
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:24,311
Yay!

764
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:30,881
- Listen, I’ll see you at Pop's tonight, huh?
- Okay, babe, take care, huh?

765
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:32,774
They got the bridge blocked off!

766
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:34,776
Let's get out of here!

767
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:37,882
Go! Go! Go!

768
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:45,358
Open this fucking door!

769
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:02,604
This is the police! You're surrounded!

770
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:06,278
Come out with your hands up!
This is the police! You're surrounded!

771
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:08,473
Bring up the gas!

772
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:22,311
Hold your fire!

773
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:26,650
Stop!

774
01:39:27,294 --> 01:39:30,786
Stop!
All right, we're coming out! Hold your fire!

775
01:39:34,868 --> 01:39:37,302
Drop the guns!

776
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:38,163
Over here! Let's go!

777
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:59,153
Popeye?

778
01:39:59,426 --> 01:40:00,358
It’s me! It’s me!

779
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:11,871
Frog one is in that room.

780
01:40:58,118 --> 01:40:59,642
Drop it!

781
01:41:17,938 --> 01:41:19,337
Mulderig.

782
01:41:20,274 --> 01:41:22,299
You shot Mulderig.

783
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:28,340
The son of a bitch is here. I saw him.
I’m going to get him.
