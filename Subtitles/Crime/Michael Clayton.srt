But is it challenging? Yes.

365
04:55:26,058 --> 04:55:31,724

first few months were a little shaky.

It was wrong. It was lame.

- We had an agreement, Arthur.
- One night.

on U/North and he wants to celebrate.

what is that? That's 24 times 30.

- Arthur.
- No, wait, wait, wait!

04:58:17,296 --> 04:58:20,129
And the numbers are making me dizzy
and, you know...

415
04:58:20,299 --> 04:58:24,497
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

05:01:55,981 --> 05:01:57,414
Michael Raymond Clayton.

483
05:01:57,583 --> 05:02:02,486
<i>Born September 9, 1959,</i>
<i>St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.</i>

484
05:02:02,654 --> 05:02:06,351
<i>Father is NYPD patrolman</i>
<i>Raymond Xavier Clayton.</i>

485
05:02:06,525 --> 05:02:09,187
<i>Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.</i>

486
05:02:09,361 --> 05:02:12,524
<i>Graduates Washingtonville Central</i>
<i>High School, Orange County, New York...</i>

488
05:02:14,500 --> 05:02:18,869
<i>Graduates St. John's University, 1980.</i>
<i>Fordham Law, '82.</i>

489
05:02:19,538 --> 05:02:24,032
<i>'82 through '86, he's ADA with</i>
<i>the Queens district attorney's office.</i>

490
05:02:24,209 --> 05:02:27,144
<i>1986, he's with</i>
<i>the Joint Manhattan-Queens...</i>

491
05:02:27,312 --> 05:02:29,246
<i>... Organized Crime Task Force.</i>

492
05:02:29,414 --> 05:02:32,815
And then in 1990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

493
05:02:32,985 --> 05:02:34,418
So he's a partner?

494
05:02:35,320 --> 05:02:37,811
No. He's listed as special counsel.

495
05:02:37,990 --> 05:02:40,015
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.

496
05:02:40,926 --> 05:02:43,554
KAREN: <i>He goes from criminal prosecution</i>
<i>to wills and trusts?</i>

497
05:02:43,729 --> 05:02:46,095
<i>He's been there 17 years,</i>
<i>he's not a partner?</i>

05:03:04,182 --> 05:03:06,446
- Hi.
- Close the door.

501
05:03:06,919 --> 05:03:10,912
All right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

502
05:03:11,490 --> 05:03:13,355
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

503
05:03:13,525 --> 05:03:17,086
We thought there was a settlement
in the works. There's been some rumors.

504
05:03:17,262 --> 05:03:21,858
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

505
05:03:22,034 --> 05:03:25,902
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.

506
05:03:26,071 --> 05:03:28,562
He's back on the mend.
He'll be fine in three or four days.

507
05:03:28,740 --> 05:03:32,904
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.

508
05:03:33,078 --> 05:03:36,047
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

509
05:03:36,214 --> 05:03:39,513
Anybody has a problem with that,
I need to know right now.

510
05:03:40,652 --> 05:03:42,017
All right.

511
05:03:42,888 --> 05:03:44,719
We're stuck here overnight.

512
05:03:44,890 --> 05:03:47,188
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

513
05:03:47,359 --> 05:03:49,259
Who's in charge of
the deposition schedule?

514
05:03:49,428 --> 05:03:51,157
- I am.
MICHAEL: Where do we stand with that?

515
05:03:51,330 --> 05:03:53,525
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.

516
05:03:53,699 --> 05:03:55,758
Nothing is on hold.
Keep doing what you were.

517
05:03:55,934 --> 05:03:58,198
Other side wants to talk about it,
they can call New York.

518
05:03:58,370 --> 05:04:01,430
- I need his briefcase.
- Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.

519
05:04:01,607 --> 05:04:04,701
- He said it was in the room.
- It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

520
05:04:05,077 --> 05:04:06,669
Find it.

521
05:04:12,651 --> 05:04:16,951
HENRY: So all these people,
they all start having these dreams, okay?

522
05:04:17,122 --> 05:04:21,525
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

523
05:04:21,693 --> 05:04:24,958
ARTHUR [OVER PHONE]:
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a...</i>

524
05:04:25,330 --> 05:04:27,195
<i>Like a special dream.</i>

525
05:04:27,366 --> 05:04:31,928
HENRY: Except this is like a whole bunch
of people having the same dream.

526
05:04:32,104 --> 05:04:35,505
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.

527
05:04:35,674 --> 05:04:37,699
They don't know why or anything.

528
05:04:37,876 --> 05:04:41,004
They just have this feeling
that they have to go there.

529
05:04:41,179 --> 05:04:43,044
ARTHUR:
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

530
05:04:43,215 --> 05:04:44,443
That's the chapter.

531
05:04:44,616 --> 05:04:47,585
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest."

532
05:04:47,753 --> 05:04:49,050
<i>That's the title.</i>

533
05:04:49,221 --> 05:04:54,887
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?

534
05:04:55,060 --> 05:04:57,028
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

535
05:04:57,562 --> 05:04:59,496
They all think it's just them.

536
05:04:59,665 --> 05:05:03,726
That maybe they're, like, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

537
05:05:03,902 --> 05:05:06,029
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

538
05:05:06,204 --> 05:05:09,696
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

539
05:05:09,875 --> 05:05:13,504
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

540
05:05:14,713 --> 05:05:19,377
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...

541
05:05:19,551 --> 05:05:21,348
...to hear it?

542
05:05:21,520 --> 05:05:23,420
Yeah. But later they will.

543
05:05:23,588 --> 05:05:26,421
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoil it.

No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.

05:05:45,010 --> 05:05:47,240
The book is <i>Realm and Conquest.</i>

ARTHUR:
Realm and Conquest.

552
05:05:49,347 --> 05:05:52,407
- It's Book One, with the red cover.
- Henry, give me the phone.

553
05:05:52,584 --> 05:05:55,144
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

- You're late.
- I know.

05:06:35,127 --> 05:06:37,652
I'm sorry, it was more complicated
than we thought.

559
05:06:37,829 --> 05:06:39,524
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

560
05:06:39,698 --> 05:06:41,859
- He's asleep.
- Well, wake him up.

561
05:06:42,033 --> 05:06:44,297
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

562
05:06:44,803 --> 05:06:47,829
Once he gets back
on his regular medication...

563
05:06:48,006 --> 05:06:49,940
...then it's just a matter of time.

564
05:06:50,108 --> 05:06:52,872
- Have you seen the video? The tape?
- I heard about it.

565
05:06:53,145 --> 05:06:55,613
What happened after is worse.

566
05:06:55,781 --> 05:06:59,683
This is in the parking lot, okay?
People running for their cars.

567
05:06:59,851 --> 05:07:01,978
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

568
05:07:02,154 --> 05:07:05,817
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

569
05:07:05,991 --> 05:07:08,789
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

570
05:07:08,960 --> 05:07:10,552
What does this mean?

571
05:07:10,962 --> 05:07:12,520
I'm not sure.

572
05:07:12,697 --> 05:07:15,325
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?

573
05:07:15,500 --> 05:07:17,297
He wasn't really making much sense.

574
05:07:17,469 --> 05:07:19,027
This is totally unacceptable.

575
05:07:19,204 --> 05:07:22,139
This is a 3-billion-dollar
class-action lawsuit.

576
05:07:22,307 --> 05:07:24,241
In the morning, I have to call my board.

577
05:07:24,409 --> 05:07:28,971
I have to tell them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

578
05:07:29,147 --> 05:07:33,311
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

579
05:07:33,485 --> 05:07:35,282
I understand.

580
05:07:36,354 --> 05:07:38,379
What sickness is he talking about?

581
05:07:38,557 --> 05:07:41,185
- I don't know. It could be anything.
- Well, give me one.

582
05:07:41,359 --> 05:07:42,656
Frostbite.

583
05:07:43,161 --> 05:07:44,788
You think this is funny?

584
05:07:44,963 --> 05:07:47,227
Look, his wife was sick
and she died last year.

585
05:07:47,399 --> 05:07:51,859
His daughter doesn't talk to him.
He's all alone. All he does is your case.

586
05:07:52,037 --> 05:07:54,733
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.

587
05:07:54,906 --> 05:07:57,602
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

588
05:07:58,310 --> 05:08:00,835
His last episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

589
05:08:01,012 --> 05:08:03,845
I helped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

590
05:08:04,015 --> 05:08:07,781
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...

591
05:08:07,953 --> 05:08:10,945
...you hired him because he's a killer,
because he's brilliant...

592
05:08:11,122 --> 05:08:13,784
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

593
05:08:13,959 --> 05:08:16,723
...for six years without a break.
- We pay for his time.

594
05:08:16,895 --> 05:08:18,920
I thought you wanted an explanation.

595
05:08:19,097 --> 05:08:21,827
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.

596
05:08:22,000 --> 05:08:25,026
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, Michael.

597
05:08:30,909 --> 05:08:33,002
He was mostly just quiet.

598
05:08:33,178 --> 05:08:36,045
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.

599
05:08:36,214 --> 05:08:38,705
MICHAEL: He took it?
- A deal's a deal, right?

She probably went back to the farm.

Well, we need her.

608
05:09:21,626 --> 05:09:26,427

they won't understand.

05:09:27,499 --> 05:09:31,026
Well, if anybody can explain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.

- Let it go, man.

It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

619
05:09:58,430 --> 05:10:00,557
That's... That's how it feels.

What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

809
05:22:46,263 --> 05:22:51,030
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

810
05:23:05,549 --> 05:23:07,039
MICHAEL:
Marty?

811
05:23:09,286 --> 05:23:12,153
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

812
05:23:12,823 --> 05:23:15,690
I'm going through his files here,
I'm reading this...

813
05:23:15,860 --> 05:23:17,725
...he's building a case against U/North.

814
05:23:17,895 --> 05:23:19,886
- Nobody's gonna let him do that.
- Let him?

815
05:23:20,064 --> 05:23:21,463
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

816
05:23:21,999 --> 05:23:24,661
You know what I just heard?
He's calling these plaintiffs.

817
05:23:24,835 --> 05:23:29,033
This woman from the deposition,
he's calling these people now.

818
05:23:29,206 --> 05:23:32,141
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

819
05:23:32,309 --> 05:23:35,870
I tried him. Can't even leave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

820
05:23:36,046 --> 05:23:38,571
- Is that his briefcase?
- Yeah.

821
05:23:39,150 --> 05:23:40,947
- Why?
- We've been looking for it.

822
05:23:41,118 --> 05:23:44,645
I don't know. It came up here
with all the other stuff from his office.

823
05:23:44,822 --> 05:23:48,553
You can't believe
the crap he's got in here.

824
05:23:49,593 --> 05:23:50,617
Listen, Marty...

825
05:23:52,596 --> 05:23:54,928
...I'm in a bind here.

826
05:23:56,100 --> 05:23:58,830
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.

827
05:24:00,004 --> 05:24:02,336
- I thought you were done with that.
- It's not that.

828
05:24:02,506 --> 05:24:05,339
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.

829
05:24:05,509 --> 05:24:07,101
Eighty thousand.

830
05:24:07,278 --> 05:24:08,745
I'm sorry to jump you like this.

831
05:24:08,913 --> 05:24:11,677
I've been trying to get a meeting
with you for two weeks.

832
05:24:12,449 --> 05:24:15,748
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

833
05:24:16,153 --> 05:24:17,848
There's nothing final on the merger.

834
05:24:18,022 --> 05:24:20,957
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meal ticket.

835
05:24:21,125 --> 05:24:23,787
Once you're out,
it's me and Barry with strangers...

836
05:24:23,961 --> 05:24:25,861
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.

837
05:24:26,030 --> 05:24:29,090
Everybody knows how valuable you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

838
05:24:29,266 --> 05:24:30,927
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.

839
05:24:31,101 --> 05:24:33,797
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years
and I got no equity.

840
05:24:33,971 --> 05:24:35,563
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.

841
05:24:35,739 --> 05:24:37,764
Nobody told you to
go into the bar business.

842
05:24:37,942 --> 05:24:40,502
I only opened it so I'd have
something else, a way out.

843
05:24:40,678 --> 05:24:42,339
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

844
05:24:42,513 --> 05:24:45,539
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a litigation team?

845
05:24:45,716 --> 05:24:47,377
- How many?
- Anybody can go to court.

846
05:24:47,551 --> 05:24:48,779
You think that's special?

847
05:24:48,953 --> 05:24:51,615
- I was good at it.
- Wonderful. So are a lot of people.

848
05:24:52,089 --> 05:24:55,456
At this, what you do, you're great.

849
05:24:55,626 --> 05:24:59,892
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

850
05:25:00,064 --> 05:25:03,056
You made a place.
You made a niche for yourself.

851
05:25:03,234 --> 05:25:07,295
And if it's nostalgia..."You should've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens."

852
05:25:07,471 --> 05:25:10,872
- Let me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

853
05:25:11,041 --> 05:25:15,034
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

854
05:25:15,913 --> 05:25:18,438
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

855
05:25:19,016 --> 05:25:22,315
So this is what? I give you the loan
or you don't help out with Arthur?

856
05:25:22,486 --> 05:25:24,078
- I never said that.
- No?

857
05:25:24,255 --> 05:25:25,586
Maybe you should have.

858
05:25:25,756 --> 05:25:30,420
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

859
05:25:30,594 --> 05:25:33,757
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cleaned up soon...

860
05:25:33,931 --> 05:25:36,058
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.

861
05:25:36,867 --> 05:25:40,200
- What are you telling me?
- That I'm counting on you.

862
05:25:40,571 --> 05:25:44,530
I'm telling you that by this time next week,
Arthur will be under control...

863
05:25:44,708 --> 05:25:48,269
...and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.

864
05:25:48,445 --> 05:25:49,742
Jesus, Marty.

865
05:25:50,014 --> 05:25:51,413
Hey.

866
05:25:51,582 --> 05:25:53,607
When did you get so fucking delicate?

867
05:25:54,718 --> 05:25:56,276
I'm late.

868
05:26:06,797 --> 05:26:09,994
[BUZZER SOUNDING]

869
05:26:35,926 --> 05:26:38,986
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene
and get the cops to help you?

870
05:26:39,163 --> 05:26:41,188
It's not that kind of a problem.

871
05:26:42,833 --> 05:26:45,233
HENRY: How much longer are we doing this?
- I don't know.

872
05:26:57,247 --> 05:27:01,047
If he comes back to get his car,
you call that number and let me know.

873
05:27:01,218 --> 05:27:04,346
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
- Okay. You're welcome.

874
05:27:11,729 --> 05:27:14,721
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

875
05:27:14,898 --> 05:27:17,662
- What?
- I wanna go home.

876
05:27:17,835 --> 05:27:19,632
Come on, Henry.

877
05:27:23,040 --> 05:27:24,029
Hold up!

878
05:27:27,077 --> 05:27:28,942
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

879
05:27:30,581 --> 05:27:33,550
- Arthur! Arthur!
ARTHUR: Oh!

880
05:27:33,717 --> 05:27:35,048
Wait up.

881
05:27:35,886 --> 05:27:39,287
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.

882
05:27:40,691 --> 05:27:43,421
- Making a delivery?
- No, no, no.

883
05:27:44,261 --> 05:27:46,889
Very funny. No, nothing like that.

884
05:27:47,064 --> 05:27:50,659
Here, take one, please. Really.
It's... It's still warm.

885
05:27:50,834 --> 05:27:52,461
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

886
05:27:56,507 --> 05:27:58,236
So welcome home.

887
05:27:58,742 --> 05:28:02,337
Oh. I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

888
05:28:02,513 --> 05:28:04,879
I was beginning to feel
a little overwhelmed.

889
05:28:05,049 --> 05:28:06,880
- But you're feeling better now?
- Yeah.

890
05:28:07,051 --> 05:28:09,542
- Much better, definitely.
- Not enough to call me back.

891
05:28:09,720 --> 05:28:12,951
Well, I was trying to,
um, gather my thoughts...

892
05:28:13,123 --> 05:28:16,718
...before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.

893
05:28:17,361 --> 05:28:18,760
And how's that going?

894
05:28:18,929 --> 05:28:21,397
Yes, it's good, very good. I just...

895
05:28:21,698 --> 05:28:27,102
Well, I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise. That's...

896
05:28:27,271 --> 05:28:28,568
That's my goal.

897
05:28:28,739 --> 05:28:32,106
As good as this feels,
you know where it goes.

898
05:28:32,276 --> 05:28:33,675
No. No. You're wrong.

899
05:28:33,844 --> 05:28:36,938
What makes this feel good
is that I don't know where it goes.

900
05:28:38,115 --> 05:28:41,278
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

901
05:28:41,452 --> 05:28:45,980
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

902
05:28:46,156 --> 05:28:49,922
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

903
05:28:50,094 --> 05:28:52,858
- Well, I hear everything.
- Then hear this.

904
05:28:53,297 --> 05:28:57,256
You need help.
Before this goes too far, you need help.

905
05:28:57,434 --> 05:28:58,662
You got great cards here.

906
05:28:58,836 --> 05:29:02,169
If you keep your clothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

907
05:29:02,339 --> 05:29:05,570
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

908
05:29:05,742 --> 05:29:08,438
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...

909
05:29:08,612 --> 05:29:10,375
...and you've got
your arms around it.

910
05:29:10,547 --> 05:29:13,846
- Well, I said I was sorry.
- You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

911
05:29:14,017 --> 05:29:16,577
You piss on this case,
they'll cut you off at the knees.

912
05:29:16,753 --> 05:29:20,018
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm covering for you.

913
05:29:20,190 --> 05:29:23,682
I'm telling them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cool.

914
05:29:23,861 --> 05:29:27,092
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.

915
05:29:27,264 --> 05:29:31,496
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

916
05:29:31,668 --> 05:29:33,533
...messing with documents
and whatever else.

917
05:29:33,704 --> 05:29:36,229
- How can you know that?
- They're gonna take everything.

918
05:29:36,406 --> 05:29:39,898
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna pull your license.

919
05:29:40,077 --> 05:29:42,238
- How do you know I called Anna?
- Marty told me.

920
05:29:42,412 --> 05:29:46,178
- Well, how does he know?
- I don't know. I don't give a shit!

921
05:29:49,887 --> 05:29:51,821
- You're tapping my phone.
- Jesus, Arthur.

922
05:29:51,989 --> 05:29:53,854
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!

923
05:29:54,024 --> 05:29:58,893
Because you're chasing a girl through
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

924
05:29:59,062 --> 05:30:01,895
You think she didn't get off the phone
and dial her attorney?

925
05:30:02,065 --> 05:30:03,930
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

926
05:30:04,101 --> 05:30:07,093
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

927
05:30:08,572 --> 05:30:12,872
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

928
05:30:13,043 --> 05:30:14,567
I'll help you think this through.

929
05:30:14,745 --> 05:30:16,975
I'll find somebody to help you
think it through.

930
05:30:17,648 --> 05:30:21,311
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

931
05:30:22,986 --> 05:30:26,149
Michael, I have great affection for you.

932
05:30:26,323 --> 05:30:30,623
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

933
05:30:31,228 --> 05:30:33,059
If you wanted to have me committed...

934
05:30:33,230 --> 05:30:37,098
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

935
05:30:37,267 --> 05:30:39,929
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

936
05:30:40,103 --> 05:30:42,071
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

937
05:30:42,239 --> 05:30:44,639
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.

938
05:30:45,075 --> 05:30:50,342
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

939
05:30:50,514 --> 05:30:53,881
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others?

940
05:30:54,051 --> 05:30:56,747
You think you got the horses for that?

941
05:30:56,920 --> 05:30:59,650
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

942
05:31:00,924 --> 05:31:05,054
The last place you want to see me
is in court.

943
05:31:05,896 --> 05:31:07,727
I'm not the enemy.

944
05:31:08,232 --> 05:31:10,257
Then who are you?

945
05:31:22,913 --> 05:31:24,813
NARRATOR:
<i>We find the seed.</i>

946
05:31:28,819 --> 05:31:30,912
<i>We shape the soil.</i>

<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

948
05:31:38,128 --> 05:31:40,062
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

949
05:31:51,808 --> 05:31:53,537
<i>We find the seed.</i>

<i>We shape the soil.</i>

05:32:02,786 --> 05:32:04,754
<i>We speed the harvest.</i>

952
05:32:06,957 --> 05:32:08,185
<i>We feed the planet.</i>

953
05:32:26,476 --> 05:32:28,273
What the hell is he doing?

954
05:32:45,829 --> 05:32:47,558
<i>We find the seed.</i>

955
05:32:49,633 --> 05:32:52,864
WOMAN: <i>You've reached the voicemail of</i>
<i>Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.</i>

956
05:32:53,036 --> 05:32:54,901
<i>Please leave your message</i>
<i>after the tone.</i>

957
05:32:55,706 --> 05:32:56,866
Yes!

958
05:32:57,207 --> 05:33:01,075
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

959
05:33:01,244 --> 05:33:04,680
<i>This is the moment you've been waiting for.</i>
<i>A very special piece of paper.</i>

960
05:33:04,848 --> 05:33:08,375

<i>malignant round of applause...</i>

<i>Would you guys like</i>
<i>a little bit of legal advice?</i>

967
05:33:31,408 --> 05:33:34,275
Never let a scientist

968
05:33:34,444 --> 05:33:37,538
...and "immediate"

He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.

06:01:48,207 --> 06:01:49,834
We never got to finish last night.

1297
06:01:50,008 --> 06:01:52,135
Did you close the place?
You look like hell.

1298
06:01:52,311 --> 06:01:55,371
- No, I left right after you left.
- Lf you say so.

1299
06:01:55,547 --> 06:01:58,243
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.

1300
06:01:58,417 --> 06:02:01,682
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

1301
06:02:01,854 --> 06:02:05,051
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.

1302
06:02:05,224 --> 06:02:08,159
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probably a mistake.

1303
06:02:08,327 --> 06:02:11,660
They're gonna pull together a memorial
service by the end of the week.

1304
06:02:11,830 --> 06:02:14,094
I told them to call you
if they need any help.

No, no, no.

1306
06:02:17,936 --> 06:02:20,234
So we cut you a check this morning.

1307
06:02:20,405 --> 06:02:23,704
There's some strings attached.
And Barry...

1308
06:02:23,876 --> 06:02:28,006
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.

1309
06:02:31,783 --> 06:02:34,217
What if Arthur was on to something?

1310
06:02:34,386 --> 06:02:36,047
What do you mean? On to what?

1311
06:02:36,221 --> 06:02:39,088
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1312
06:02:39,258 --> 06:02:41,419
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1313
06:02:41,593 --> 06:02:44,027
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.

1314
06:02:44,196 --> 06:02:47,131
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1315
06:02:47,299 --> 06:02:49,290
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

1316
06:02:49,468 --> 06:02:52,198
What would they do?
What would they do if he went public?

1317
06:02:52,371 --> 06:02:55,772
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1318
06:02:55,941 --> 06:02:58,375
We don't straighten the settlement out
in 24 hours...

1319
06:02:58,544 --> 06:03:00,603
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

1320
06:03:00,779 --> 06:03:03,748
Then they'll pull out the video of Arthur
doing his flashdance.

1321
06:03:03,916 --> 06:03:05,645
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1322
06:03:05,817 --> 06:03:09,480
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

1323
06:03:09,655 --> 06:03:12,317
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.

1324
06:03:12,791 --> 06:03:14,486
That's 80.

1325

You're doing this now?

1329
06:03:24,469 --> 06:03:27,802
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

1330
06:03:27,973 --> 06:03:30,840
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1331
06:03:31,009 --> 06:03:33,102
It's gonna be bulletproof
and retroactive.

1332
06:03:33,278 --> 06:03:35,007
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1333
06:03:35,180 --> 06:03:38,980
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

1334
06:03:39,151 --> 06:03:41,711
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1335
06:03:42,387 --> 06:03:45,083
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1336
06:03:45,257 --> 06:03:47,919
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1337
06:03:48,093 --> 06:03:50,687
- Lf I'm wrong, I apologize.
- You're way the fuck wrong.

1338
06:03:50,862 --> 06:03:52,090

Holy shit.

1422
06:15:25,690 --> 06:15:30,627
KAREN: <i>It has been and it remains</i>
<i>the U/North position...</i>

1423
06:15:30,795 --> 06:15:34,891
<i>... that this lawsuit is baseless</i>
<i>and without merit.</i>

1424
06:15:35,066 --> 06:15:39,127
Our reluctance to negotiate
was anchored by this belief...

1425
06:15:39,304 --> 06:15:44,469
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

1426
06:15:44,642 --> 06:15:47,202
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1427
06:15:47,378 --> 06:15:50,836
The reason that we are
all here today is...

1428
06:15:51,015 --> 06:15:54,883
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

1429
06:15:55,887 --> 06:16:00,324
<i>You all have</i>
<i>a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1430
06:16:00,925 --> 06:16:04,884
<i>... which outlines the details,</i>
<i>but the bottom line is this:</i>

1431
06:16:05,063 --> 06:16:07,827
<i>Over the past several months</i>
<i>we had gotten word...</i>

1432
06:16:07,999 --> 06:16:11,332
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1433
06:16:11,502 --> 06:16:15,336
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

1434
06:16:15,840 --> 06:16:17,307
<i>We also learned...</i>

1435
06:16:17,475 --> 06:16:21,411
<i>... that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees</i>
<i>were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1436
06:16:21,579 --> 06:16:23,672
<i>... up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1437
06:16:24,115 --> 06:16:28,347
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1438
06:16:28,519 --> 06:16:33,081
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

1439
06:16:33,257 --> 06:16:34,588
...in the middle there.

1440
06:16:35,360 --> 06:16:37,055
<i>Finally...</i>

1441
06:16:37,228 --> 06:16:41,562
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1442
06:16:41,733 --> 06:16:43,564
...and that the tax benefit...

1443
06:16:43,735 --> 06:16:46,966
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

1444
06:16:47,138 --> 06:16:49,572
...and within this fiscal year...

1445
06:16:49,741 --> 06:16:55,611
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

1446
06:16:56,114 --> 06:17:00,312
<i>The package that you have before you</i>
<i>represents, in my judgment...</i>

1447
06:17:00,752 --> 06:17:05,553
<i>... the strongest possible position for</i>
<i>our company under the circumstances.</i>

1448
06:17:05,723 --> 06:17:07,418
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1449
06:17:07,592 --> 06:17:10,857

that this proposal be confirmed.

1458
06:18:08,886 --> 06:18:10,353
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1459
06:18:10,521 --> 06:18:12,648
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.

1460
06:18:12,824 --> 06:18:14,189
What do you think I'm doing?

1461
06:18:14,358 --> 06:18:16,155
The suit's over. We have a deal.

1462
06:18:16,327 --> 06:18:19,023
Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.

1463
06:18:19,197 --> 06:18:22,860
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.

1464
06:18:23,034 --> 06:18:25,229
I didn't realize you'd signed
all those checks.

1465
06:18:25,403 --> 06:18:28,702
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

1466
06:18:28,873 --> 06:18:30,204
I'm calling Marty.

1467
06:18:30,374 --> 06:18:32,740
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great place to start.

1468
06:18:32,910 --> 06:18:35,708
Let's find out who told him
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

1469
06:18:35,880 --> 06:18:37,711
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1470
06:18:37,882 --> 06:18:41,682
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt...

1471
06:18:41,853 --> 06:18:45,289
- I know what you did to Arthur.
- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1472
06:18:45,456 --> 06:18:48,220
- I know you killed him.
- It's attorney-client privilege.

1473
06:18:48,392 --> 06:18:52,055
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

1474
06:18:52,230 --> 06:18:54,926
For such a smart person,
you really are lost, aren't you?

1475
06:18:55,099 --> 06:18:56,430
This conversation is over.

1476
06:18:56,601 --> 06:19:00,037
I'm not the guy that you kill.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1477
06:19:00,204 --> 06:19:02,729
Are you so fucking blind
you don't even see what I am?

1478
06:19:02,907 --> 06:19:06,399
I'm the easiest part of your whole
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1479
06:19:06,711 --> 06:19:09,839
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1480
06:19:10,014 --> 06:19:13,415
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1481
06:19:13,584 --> 06:19:15,484
...and you're gonna kill me?

1482
06:19:16,420 --> 06:19:19,253
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1483
06:19:19,423 --> 06:19:23,120
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1484
06:19:23,294 --> 06:19:27,128
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

1485
06:19:28,633 --> 06:19:30,066
What do you want?

1486
06:19:30,234 --> 06:19:31,758
What do I want?

1487
06:19:31,936 --> 06:19:33,528
I want more.

1488
06:19:34,038 --> 06:19:35,801
I want out.

1489
06:19:35,973 --> 06:19:38,601
And with this, I want everything.

1490
06:19:40,378 --> 06:19:41,606
Is there a number?

1491
06:19:41,779 --> 06:19:43,371
Ten is a number.

1492
06:19:43,548 --> 06:19:45,573
Ten? Ten what?

1493
06:19:47,618 --> 06:19:49,108
Ten million?

1494
06:19:49,287 --> 06:19:52,723
Where do you think I'm gonna get
10 million dollars?

1495
06:19:53,291 --> 06:19:55,191
You know what's great about this?

1496
06:19:55,359 --> 06:19:57,657
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1497
06:19:58,229 --> 06:20:00,129
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1498
06:20:00,298 --> 06:20:03,290
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

1499
06:20:05,136 --> 06:20:07,536
This would have to be
a longer conversation...

1500
06:20:07,705 --> 06:20:09,832
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.

1501
06:20:10,007 --> 06:20:11,497
Where? My car?

1502
06:20:13,077 --> 06:20:14,101
All right.

1503
06:20:15,279 --> 06:20:18,305
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.

1504
06:20:18,482 --> 06:20:20,279
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1505
06:20:22,653 --> 06:20:27,420
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

1506
06:20:27,592 --> 06:20:31,323
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

1507
06:20:31,495 --> 06:20:33,588
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

1508
06:20:33,764 --> 06:20:36,130
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don...

1509
06:20:36,300 --> 06:20:38,894
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

1510
06:20:39,070 --> 06:20:40,401
DON:
Karen?

1511
06:20:41,105 --> 06:20:42,970
KAREN: One second.
- Everything okay?

1512
06:20:44,342 --> 06:20:45,331
Yes.

1513
06:20:46,344 --> 06:20:50,144
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. Immediately.

1514
06:20:50,314 --> 06:20:51,440
- Yes.
- Say it!

1515
06:20:51,616 --> 06:20:55,484
Ten million dollars, your account,
the moment this meeting is through.

1516
06:20:55,653 --> 06:20:57,951
DON: Karen! Everyone's waiting.
KAREN: I'm coming, Don.

1517
06:20:58,990 --> 06:21:00,355
You have a deal.

1518
06:21:00,925 --> 06:21:02,187
You're so fucked.

1519
06:21:02,526 --> 06:21:03,857
What?

1520
06:21:04,362 --> 06:21:06,227
- You're fucked.
- What do you mean?

1521
06:21:06,397 --> 06:21:08,627
- Take a wild guess.
DON: Is there a problem?

1522
06:21:08,799 --> 06:21:11,495
- I don't understand.
- Let me get a picture while I'm at it.

1523
06:21:11,669 --> 06:21:14,467
- You don't want the money?
- Keep the money. You'll need it.

1524
06:21:14,639 --> 06:21:16,231
Is this fellow bothering you?

1525
06:21:16,407 --> 06:21:17,635
Am I bothering you?

1526
06:21:17,808 --> 06:21:21,835
DON: Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.
What the hell's going on? Who are you?

1527
06:21:22,013 --> 06:21:23,708
I'm Shiva, the god of death.

1528
06:21:23,881 --> 06:21:27,510
DON: Ron! Ronny, I need security
out here immediately.

1529
06:21:28,419 --> 06:21:29,681
All right. Here we go.

1530
06:21:29,854 --> 06:21:33,051
That guy right there, stop him.
Grab that guy.

1531
06:21:34,659 --> 06:21:35,853
What are you doing?

1532
06:21:36,027 --> 06:21:37,756
DALBERTO:
We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.

1533
06:21:37,928 --> 06:21:39,896
Come back with us
and we'll explain everything.

1534
06:21:40,064 --> 06:21:43,329
Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need
any medical attention.

1535
06:21:43,501 --> 06:21:45,662
You guys go into the ballroom.
Nobody leaves.

1536
06:21:45,836 --> 06:21:47,599
Have your guys cover every exit.

1537
06:21:47,772 --> 06:21:50,570
DON: Will you please explain to me
what's going on here?

1538
06:21:51,208 --> 06:21:52,573
Did you get all that?

1539
06:21:52,743 --> 06:21:54,938
Yeah. Got it.

1540
06:21:58,582 --> 06:22:01,415
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just gotta get some air.

1541
06:22:01,585 --> 06:22:03,075
Sure.

1542
06:22:03,454 --> 06:22:06,218
Just stay close, okay?

1543
06:22:06,390 --> 06:22:07,618
Okay.

1544
06:23:18,262 --> 06:23:20,093
DRIVER:
So, what are we doing?

1545
06:23:27,171 --> 06:23:29,162
Give me 50 dollars' worth.

1546
06:23:31,041 --> 06:23:32,702
Just drive.

1547
06:29:17,955 --> 06:29:19,946
