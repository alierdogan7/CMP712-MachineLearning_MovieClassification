1
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,127
I take a schnapps.

2
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,250
You know, schnapps?
- Vodka?

3
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,503
One. One schnapps.
- Vodka?

4
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,632
Yeah.

5
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,011
Are you Swedish?

6
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,096
Are you?
- What?

7
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,185
I'm what?
- Swedish?

8
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,812
No.

9
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,566
Want a half or full?
- Full.

10
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,856
That's four.

11
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,168
Do you want one?
- Want what?

12
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,961
Do you want one?
- No, I'm fine.

13
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,832
Quick question:
is it good in there?

14
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,292
I don't speak German.

15
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,885
Is good inside?
- Yes, it's good.

16
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,261
Yeah? Really?
- Yes.

17
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,797
Good party inside?
- Yes.

18
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,436
Get in line.

19
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:04,119
Three good reasons: Good mood,
we look amazing...

20
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,588
Just a quick question! I know her!

21
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,798
I have one question.
What are you doing now?

22
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,176
What?
- What are you doing now?

23
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,553
I'm leaving.
- Why?

24
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,228
We're true Berliners!

25
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,440
I was just talking.

26
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,027
Wait, I'll get us in, dude!
- Guys, it's over! Out you go.

27
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,730
Clear the way!

28
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,862
It's cool. It's cool.
- You won't get in without money.

29
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,078
I put on my dancing shoes specially!
- Take him with you.

30
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,324
Brother, Fuss wants to dance!
- Off you go!

31
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,797
One day the club'll be ours.

32
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,418
Yeah, say what you like.

33
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,839
Whatever...

34
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,964
One day this club will be ours!
Understand?

35
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,390
We'll buy your club!

36
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,598
Watch out, man!

37
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:13,544
Do you want a ride with us?
Have a ride with us?

38
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,913
With my car?
- That's your car?

39
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,836
Yes. It's my car.
You want to? No problem.

40
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,791

44
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,137

That's Boxer...
- Just a quick story...

49
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,443
That's your real name?
- And here. That's Fuss. It's his birthday today.

50
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,984
That's my car. They gave it
to me as a birthday present!

51
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,488
It's my car!
- And that's Blinker.

52
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,498
I'm Blinker! Bling bling Blinker!
- Blinker?

53
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,086
Those are, like, real names?
- Of course they're our real names!

54
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,210
OK!
- We have different mothers, of course.

55
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,216
But you want a ride? No problem.
- But it's really your car?

56
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,928
But your friend's on your car. He's on your car.
- Yeah, yeah. No problem for me.

57
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,265
OK, open the car.

58
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,814
Do we have our keys? Our keys are...
- Where are the keys?

59
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,105
Fuck. We left the keys
in the club, dude.

60
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:24,022
They're in club. And also it's a good
parking lot and stuff. No, we can't, we can't...

61
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,576
But where are you from?
- Nice to meet you, sister!

62
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,906
Nice to meet you.

63
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,791
I'm Blinker.
- Blinker? - Bling bling Blinker.

64
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,120
My bling bling is... at home.

65
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:44,168
I think that's not your car.
- Really. But you can just touch it, if you want to.

66
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,213
I can touch it but not open it, right?
- No, you cannot open...

67
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,383
...because we don't have any keys for the car.

68
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,136
Fuck me, it's really open!

69
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,189
It is my car!
It is my fucking car!

70
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,853
Hey, guys, Wait...

71
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,436
Come on!
- I swear it's our car! I swear!

72
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,900
Hey, really. It's our car.
- Sonne...

73
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,778
...you're a liar!
- I'm not! I'm never lying.

74
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,608
Hands off the car!

75
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,743
Fuck off!

76
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,658
Are you fucking mental?

77
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:15,915
Are you fucking insane?

78
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,708
Yeah, man, calm down!

79
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,914
Get the fuck away!

80
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,959
Shut the fuck up!
- No, you fuck off, man!

81
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,626
Do you want to come to my birthday party?

00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,089
You will party now?
- We'll party now...

83
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,425
Do you want to come

84
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,761
and then we can...

85
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,892
Fuss, don't push it!
- It's just 'cos it's my birthday party...

86
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,397
Where are you from?
- Madrid? You know Madrid?

87
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,363
Of course we know Madrid!
I went there a few times.

88
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,858
You've been there?
- Many times I went to Madrid.

89
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,995
For me, it's my happy place,
is Madrid. Really.

90
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:58,916
No, really my happy place
is originally Berlin, you know, 'cos...

91
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,788
...we're not "zugezogenen".
We are real Berlin guys, you know?

92
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,006
We're not "'zugezogen". Ha!

93
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,462
As if you knew the English!

94
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,678
East Berlin! East Berlin! East Berlin!
- Shut the fuck up!

95
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,255
Hey, my name is Boxero!
- Boxero?

96
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,930
But that's your real name? Boxer is
like a boxer? It's like Boxer, right?

97
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,604
He is a boxer! He is a boxer.
- And you're like the sun, you say?

98
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,268
Yeah, 'cos I'm really a sun.

99
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,021
Quit talking about my sister, Fuss!

100
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:30,737
Your sister is sweet for real!
- But which one?

101
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,279
You're Berlin guys, then.
- Yeah, we are real Berlin guys!

102
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,999
Do you want to...? 'Cos we can
show you real Berlin, if you want to.

103
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,165
Wow! Really?
- 'Cos real Berlin is on the street.

104
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:47,917
It's not in a club. Clubs are for shit. It's like
you can go there, also when you are Spanish...

105
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:53,969
...like you! But...
Now we show you a street if you want to.

106
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,925
We can go drink there.
There's my shop.

107
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,932
You're going to drink something now?

108
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,813
You have a shop?

109
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,941
How do you say 'Spatkauf?

110
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,529
What's up?
You wanna add something?

111
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,647
I'm saying nothing!

112
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,534
You come from where...?
- Madrid.

113
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,403
Madrid?
- Yeah.

114
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,871
I know Madrid. Real Madrid!

115
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,204
Come with us. Would you come for a beer?

116
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,416
I don't know. I have to...
I have to work today.

117
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,750
Yeah, but hey! It's four o'clock!
Victoria, really. It's four o'clock.

118
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,586
Just for one beer. I just show you...

119
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,338
Let's go for one beer
and we talk a little bit...

120
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,594
I show you our world, you know?
- OK.

121
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,719
Come, sister, come.
We go to the late night shop!

122
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,764
We go to the late night shop.
- Late night? No.

123
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,772
Late night, huh?
Late night shop, so something different.

124
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,778
Do you know Molle?
- Molle? No. What's that?

125
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,356
Let's get some 'Molle'.

126
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,192
"Molle" is like, in Berlin
it's like beer, you know?

127
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,077
So you're happy here?
You're happy here?

128
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,078
Happy?

129
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,583
Happy'? Are you happy?

130
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,382
A little bit. I've been here just...
- A little bit?

131
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,053
...or really happy?
Or a little bit happy?

132
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,547
A little bit happy?

133
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,303
Because I'm here just three month
and I don't know anyone.

134
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,471
Now you've met us.
Now you can be "richtig gliicklich".

135
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,352
Hey!

136
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,773
Just leave your bike here.
- I leave the bike here?

137
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,438
Don't be... Everything is cool.

138
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,070
He's "pimping" your bike right now.

139
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,283
What's that?
- Pimping a bike?

140
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,828
They do it, like...
- Like jumps?

141
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,418
Like everything.
- No, please! Come on!

142
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,209
Don't worry!
- I need the bike!

143
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,426
Give me some cash!

144
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,007
Give me some cash. Cash!

145
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,047
Blinker, hey!

146
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,131
I need cash.

147
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,517
We have no money.
What do you want me to pay?

148
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,101
Give me some money.
- Wait, wait.

149
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,059
Fuss, got some paper in your pocket?

150
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,977
Fuss is in a different world.

151
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:17,111
Fuss is partying.
- It's his birthday.

152
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,442
Wait here a moment.

153
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,819
Don't start any shit.
I'll get some beer.

154
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,374
So these are like your best friends?
- That's my boys. That's my brothers.

155
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,870
But you're a family?
- Yeah, it's my family.

156
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,422
Yeah, we can say family. That's right.

157
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,385
Man, you scared me!

158
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,095
Cut it out, man!

159
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,922
Let me talk to her, retard!

160
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,141
Do you need any help?

161
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,637
<i>Go away. Let me...</i>

162
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,722
After you, after you.
- OK.

163
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,393
Yo, Farouk, dude!

164
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,983
Farouk?
- He's sleeping.

165
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,402
What do you want?

166
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,705
Sorry.
- Hey! No, no, no! Shhh!

167
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,289
Don't wake him up in his dreams.
- OK.

168
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,459
Maybe he have a good dream, you know.
- Yeah, but...

169
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,895
Are you stealing?

170
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:34,355
No, no. I pay tomorrow! I don't want...
He's a friend of mine. Really.

171
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,566
I swear, he's a friend of mine...
- OK.

172
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:47,163
I pay him tomorrow. I know him very long time.
- Yeah, like that was your shop?

173
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,708
Yeah, it is my shop.

174
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,585
Let's say good night.

175
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,133
Good night, and nice dreams.

176
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,303
I hope you have nice dreams.

177
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,764
Really good. Ah, peanuts!

178
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,187
Where are those guys?

179
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,185
Guys!

180
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,690
Where are these motherfuckers?

181
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,195
Boys!
- Hey! She stole it all.

182
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,663
Oh, sister! Thank you very much!
- What? What's he saying?

183
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,121
You are stoling the beer?
- No!

184
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,034
Really?

185
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,209
Stop pretending!

186
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,705
Bad girl! Bad girl!

187
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,047
OK, I'm going to return the beer.

188
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,753
We are just kidding.

189
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,180
So you stole again?
- Yeah. Coming from you!

190
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,383
We make a little party
here in this town, you know?

191
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,180
Hey, Victoria! Come here!

192
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,855
Come here, dude. Do you know
how to drink schnapps?

193
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,185
You drink it.

194
00:16:56,224 --> 00:17:01,572
You put this on your nose, you know?
You put like that. Well, come on...

195
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,526
It's a birthday present. From me.
Would you put it on the nose?

196
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:12,241
You look great! Amazing!

197
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,540
Stop that bisexual shit, man!

198
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,122
What kind of faggot are you?

199
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,499
Here, for you.

200
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,343
So, chin chin.
- Chin chin.

201
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,635
In German, it's like, it's like "Zum Wohle".

202
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,636
You can say "Prost".

203
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,398
Cheers!
- Cheers!

204
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,482
'Zum Wohle' is better than 'Prost'!
Speak proper German with her!

205
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,863
Nice to meet you.

206
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,905
Hey, cut that shit out!

207
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,737
I dropped the soap, Boxer!

208
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,990
I dropped the soap!

209
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,537
Oh, shit!

210
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,410
Stop that crap!

211
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,542
Do you want a cigarette?
- No. Thank you, no.

212
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,545
I have peanuts, if you want peanuts.
- Yeah?

213
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,016
Not, that's not peanuts. That's Turkish.

214
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,768
What's that?

215
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,516
Hazelnut kernels: roasted.
- Ah, OK. Roasted.

216
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,819
Yes, but it's not peanuts.
- OK.

217
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,063
Hey, guys. Chill a sec.

218
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,024
What are you going to do now?

219
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,868
He's a dancer. You know...?

220
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,862
"He's my private dancer..."

221
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,329
Really? Can you do a jump, or, you know...?

222
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,202
Time for his little show.

223
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,592
It's cool. Wow!

224
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,468
So good. You're a dancer?

225
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,970
You can't do that!

226
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,714
At last you've got
someone to impress!

227
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,092
Now you've got someone!

228
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,598
For your old school shit!

229
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,059
Pistols? Got pistols on you?

230
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,146
What's going on?
What? What?

231
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,935
Quick question...

232
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,111
Get lost.
- Boxer, back off.

233
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,447
Boxer!
- Piss off!

234
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,900
Fuck off, you pussies!

235
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,994
Stop it, Boxer!

236
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,617
Stop this shit!

237
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,370
Back off. Everything's OK.

238
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,665
Boxer, what's wrong with you?

239
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,339
Please, man, it's a party!

240
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,383
It's his birthday. Cut it out.

241
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,222
Boxer, please!

242
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,302
You know, they're stupid guys.

243
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,309
Boxer! Beer!
- Yeah. Beer.

244
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,980
Man, you're always causing trouble!

245
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,319
Chill out, hey.

246
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,197
Relax. It's the cops.

247
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,782
Good evening!

248
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,236
Have a slow dance with me for my birthday...

249
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,196
Let's smoke a joint.
To peace! Peace!

250
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,999
What are you going to do now?
Are you going to party?

251
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,205
Smoke a joint. For peace!

252
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,546
Sometimes I just enjoy the harmony, you know?

253
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,419
Those sons of bitches!

254
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,421
Let's smoke one here!

255
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,175
They're coming back.
They're coming back. Shit.

256
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,431
We're on a zebra crossing. We're fine.

257
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,847
I have to go.
- Take your bike.

258
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,443
It's actually legal,
but let's go anyway.

259
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,358
Let's get out of here.

260
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,448
Let's hit the roof, boys.
Let's hit the roof!

261
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,993
I have to go, guys!
- Where you go? Where you go?

262
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,954
I have to open the cafe now.

263
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,417
We're going now to the...
We're going to the roof.

264
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,838
We have our personal roof.
- A roof? A roof?

265
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,292
We're going there now.
Come. I drive you to the roof.

266
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,507
No, I drive you.
- No, I drive you.

267
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,965
Come on!
- You can't. I'm too heavy.

268
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,299
No, I can.

269
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,184
Sister! You come with us?

270
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,432
No ego trips, man.
- I'm not...

271
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,479
You touched my ass.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

272
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,601
Come on!
- Sorry, I don't want to touch your ass...

273
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:11,025
Say sorry! With the heart!

274
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,525
Sorry.
- OK.

275
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,651
I told you.

276
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,408
Ah, you're stopping the bike!
- I never stopped...

277
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,452
Come on, drive, you.

278
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,621
That's West Berlin guys, huh?

279
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,952
That's real Berlin guys.

280
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,834
You've messed up my cigarette.

281
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,707
Take this beer.

282
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,842
Hey, guys. Don't break anything!

283
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,801
I'm going ahead. See you later!
- Where to? Where to?

284
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,428
Looking good, Sonne!

285
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,894
I'm out of here!
I'm never coming back!

286
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,439
See that? Escort party,
dude, escort party!

287
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,063
Guys! Blinker! Come on!

288
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,201
Sister!

289
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,871
Shut the fuck up!

290
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,584
Sister, please!

291
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,876
She's screaming, man!

292
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,204
Fucking great!

293
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,039
Sister, please. Come!

294
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,631
You're funny. You were like, "Shhh!"

295
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,636
Sister, the people is a little bit crazy.
- You want to go to sleep now?

296
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,808
Fuss, where are you?
- I'm coming!

297
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,976
Talk louder, why don't you?

298
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:48,700
Let's relax. Because the neighbours are assholes.
- Ah, OK.

299
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:55,782
You come here always?
You come here always?

300
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,963
We've been here since we was... one year old.

301
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:11,089
All together?
- We was babies. We was jumping on each other...

302
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,847
No. But yeah, it's our place.
- OK.

303
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,972
Tell her why I'm famous. I'm famous!

304
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,976
I'm famous.

305
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,316
I'm not a faggot, man!

306
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,120
He stole a truck when he was eleven years old.

307
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:39,705
He stole a truck and he went
on a highway to Poland.

308
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,120
That's true?
- Quit laughing.

309
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:46,131
And you were famous for that?
- I was eleven!

310
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:51,262
It was the news. There was an interview.
- Blinker was in the news, too.

311
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,883
His picture was in the newspaper.
With the picture, you know?

312
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,019
Don't talk so loud!

313
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,267
I'm just saying"-

314
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:07,862
Blinker used to steal
these pizza mopeds...

315
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,190
He stole these pizza scooters.

316
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,236
I don't stole it for the scooter.

317
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,451
I stole it for my brothers,
these hungry motherfuckers!

318
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,074
Definitely.

319
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,784
For the pizza!

320
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,502
Which one would like the calzone?
This one, "tonno"...

321
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:32,795
...this one, vegetarian.
It's expensive, sister. It's really expensive.

322
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,849
What's that?

323
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,723
Shut the fuck up!

324
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,941
I smashed a guy.
- What?

325
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:55,784
I really hurt...
I hurt a guy very bad.

326
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,660
But what's the relation with the tattoo?

327
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,253
I'm not a bad guy. I just...
I did a bad thing, OK?

328
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:11,212
Yeah, but...
You did this tattoo for that reason'?

329
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,507
Because you did something bad?

330
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,296
Who cares?

331
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,508
He was in jail...

332
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:23,433
You were in jail'?
- Yeah. Blinker visited him. Three times?

333
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:30,145
Sister, I visit him three times.
I give him everything he want. What he want.

334
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,565
He was really a good friend.
- How many times you...

335
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,781
You smoke? You don't smoke,
then don't. I don't like it!

336
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,533
I don't wanna get her hooked!
- Oh, you're so righteous.

337
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:47,829
Don't think I'm a bad guy, OK?
It's over, the thing.

338
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,256
Quit laughing, moron.
- I'm not laughing...

339
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,925
I don't think so.

340
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,715
Thanks, sister.

341
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:03,094
Bro, I wasn't laughing about you.
It was something else.

342
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,017
Sister, please, careful. It's danger.

343
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,610
I'm OK.

344
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,326
Sonne, dude, please.
- What?

345
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:24,786
Woah! It's really high!
It's really high! It's like...

346
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:32,168
Hey, come back. Come back to the chairs.
- Shut the fuck up! OK. Look.

347
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,047
Sister! Don't do that shit!

348
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,970
It's really scaring? It's very scaring?

349
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,306
Come.

350
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,809
Are you scared?
- Please.

351
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,647
Are you scared?
- I'm never scared.

352
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,272
Are you brave?
- Of course I am. Look at me.

353
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,771
Look at me!
- Hey, man!

354
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,615
Victoria, why are you doing this?

355
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,156
Do you want to jump?

356
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,662
No.

357
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,828
I am quiet.
You shut the fuck up!

358
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,287
Hey, come on. Hey! Really.

359
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,675
Hey, come on. Please.
Please. Hallo.

360
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,596
Now, come. Please come.

361
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:25,302
Look, I can also do this?
But now, let's go.

362
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,776
I have to go.
Yeah. I have to go.

363
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,734
Why? Why you go?
- I have to open the cafe at 7...

364
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,446
...and I need to sleep a little bit.
I'm tired. Tonight.

365
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:46,864
Where is your cafe?
- That one. Look.

366
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:52,252
It's not time enough to go home
and sleep there and come back again.

367
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,169
OK, sorry.
- But, if you want, I can bring you there.

368
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,419
Yeah?
- Yeah. Because you're not a good driver.

369
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,218
OK.
- Yeah. I bring you.

370
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,431
Hey guys, I go! I go!

371
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,767
I have to work.
- Why?

372
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,391
You don't work?

373
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,518
You gonna take her home?

374
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,109
Nice to meet you.
- Also, nice to meet you.

375
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,191
Fuss, happy birthday!

376
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,202
Why are you going now?
- Because I have to work!

377
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,245
I'll see you.
- Where?

378
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,742
You don't have to work?

379
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,333
I'll just take her home.
- You're coming back?

380
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,035
No ego trips, dude.
- It's not an ego trip, retard!

381
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,292
Hey! Good guy!

382
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,091
See you again.

383
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,011
See you tomorrow.

384
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:51,179
Goodbye, wankers!

385
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,647
We'll wait for you!
- Yeah, wait!

386
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,187
Such a Casanova!

387
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,378
Did you like the roof?
- I like it a lot!

388
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,846
It's a good place.
- Shh. Now we have to be very silent. Not like...

389
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,342
Oh.

390
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,439
Because nobody talks in Germany
in the elevator.

391
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,605
It's forbidden.

392
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,692
Come on.
- Shh! It's forbidden. I told you.

393
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,819
Don't you want...
- Shh! I told you.

394
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,369
I'm gonna break the rule.
I'm gonna break the rule!

395
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:02,257
OK, now we can talk again.
After you.

396
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,262
OK, I drive you.

397
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,022
It's here, right?
- Yeah.

398
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,601
Hey, wait, wait. One sip. Give me one sip.

399
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,663
OK. Jump on it!

400
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,121
I don't know if I can do that.

401
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,582
Ready'? Wait, wait...

402
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,669
You're from the circus, right?

403
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,383
That's more scaring than the roof.

404
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:53,138
I promise. You're a good driver or not?
- I am a good driver. You see?

405
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,179
I drive slowly, look?
- Yeah.

406
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,312
You don't seem German at all.

407
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,775
We are real Berlin guys.

408
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:11,034
There are many people just coming here
and think they are Berlin, but we are Berlin.

409
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,779
We're real Berlin.
Multiculture, you know?

410
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,040
So where's the cafe?
- Just straight on.

411
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,247
I'm going to tell you. It's on the right.

412
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,000
Are you nuts? This is a pavement!

413
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,877
Relax. You know what time it is?

414
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:30,338
What's he saying?
- He's telling me about, don't drive on... here.

415
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:34,016
We cannot drive here?
- Nah, he's stupid. Whatever.

416
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,098
He's just angry because he have no wife.
- OK.

417
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,307
See the door?
- I see it.

418
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,896
You see I'm a good driver.
- Yeah, you are.

419
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,991
Thank you.

420
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:58,411
It was... It was very nice to meet you.

421
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,749
It was really nice to meet you too.

422
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:09,422
We have to see another day.
- Yeah, let's see another day.

423
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,799
Bye. It was fun.

424
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,932
Because you're like that all the time.
You just give the hand. You do like this.

425
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:24,145
No, no. I'm just, you know...
Ah, whatever.

426
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:30,110
Maybe, I don't know if you have
to go back to the roof, but...

427
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:35,241
...if you want to come inside and...
for a coffee...

428
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,329
...or whatever...

429
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:43,836
The problem is, the problem is really,
I don't drink coffee, you know?

430
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:49,212
I'm just drinking cacao! You know cacao?
You know, you have to...

431
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:54,798
You know what I mean? I'm a cacao guy.
- You're a cacao guy?

432
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,257
I have cacao inside.
- Really? - Yeah.

433
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:02,229
But I just like it, normally
I just like it cold. And really strong.

434
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:07,276
Really? Like double cacao?
- Yeah, let's make a double cacao.

435
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,529
OK. So come on.
- Yeah? OK.

436
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,323
Wait, I help you. I help you.
- Yeah, please.

437
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,290
Put it here?
- Yeah, anywhere.

438
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,215
Yeah, it's alright.

439
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,764
It's a nice hot... Hotel? Cafe!

440
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,187
We don't have to whisper here.

441
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:53,113
Yeah, sorry...
I was just on the roof.

442
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,941
Me too...

443
00:37:56,566 --> 00:38:00,036
So, cold cacao.
- Yeah, cold cacao, please. Double!

444
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,197
Double cacao for you.

445
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:08,955
What do you... How much money
you get here? Per hour?

446
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,964
Like, I don't know. Four Euros?
- Four Euros?

447
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,881
Man, it's nothing! They just want... Four Euros?!
- Yeah.

448
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:23,511
But you get tip and stuff?
- Yeah, sometimes.

449
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:29,732
I should kill my boss.
- Yeah, you have to kill your boss, I think!

450
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:38,071
You know I'm a professional piano player.
You know this?

451
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:42,738
Really?
- Yeah, I am. - Please. I want to see.

452
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,704
Wait! Like the car?
You have a car, and you have a shop?

453
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,036
And now you're a piano player?

454
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,918
Yeah, my uncle was...

455
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,922
... Mozart.

456
00:38:55,124 --> 00:39:00,255
Yeah, really, it was...
an older uncle from me is Mozart.

457
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,266
Yeah, really.
So it's just in my blood right now.

458
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,552
So maybe I can show you something.
No problem.

459
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:06,511
I want to see that.

460
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,973
But my hands are a little bit cold.
- You have to do like this.

461
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,560
Yeah, I know how to do this. I'm a professional.
- OK, sorry! Sorry!

462
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,938
OK, don't give me tips.

463
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:24,037
OK, maybe it's because I'm not into it
right now, but I show you something.

464
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,450
Just with my eyes closed.
- OK.

465
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,375
Thank you very much.
- So good!

466
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,218
Your face was so deep in...
It was like...

467
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,929
Yeah, because it was deep.
- OK.

468
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,345
I know I'm good.
I know I'm good.

469
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,725
Yeah, you're so good I think
I'm falling in love with you right now.

470
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,482
Really? Same!

471
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,744
But do you play an instrument?
- Yes. One.

472
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:09,704
One? What kind of instrument?
- Guess what.

473
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,705
There's so many...

474
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,842
At the first time I thought
you are more a triangle guy?

475
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:27,217
Really? I look like that?
- Yeah, you look like a little bit...

476
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:32,018
But different. You put triangle
like this... like a

477
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:38,278
And if you look like this now? How I look?
I look like a triangle girl also?

478
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:43,780
But it's a compliment!
- That's a compliment? I think you should go out of my cafe right now.

479
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:49,160
OK, now I know what you're playing.
- What?

480
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,629
A drummer... No, no, not drummer. Yeah,
a drummer, but I think you are a drummer...

481
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:02,712
You're from Madrid, right? You are
one of the best drummer from Real Madrid.

482
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:08,308
From Real Madrid, you are in the first row, like 'You're Never Walk Alone'?
- OK.

483
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,766
But it might be? You look like it also.
- No, no, please.

484
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:16,896
No, no, for real. What do you play?
- I play this.

485
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,733
You play piano?
- Yeah. I am the daughter of Mozart.

486
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,232
You're not the daughter.
I should know you if...

487
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,818
No, really'? You play piano?
- Yeah.

488
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,828
You saw I'm really good in it.

489
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,824
Yeah, and I was like "Woah!"
You should be my teacher!

490
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:36,545
I can practice you everything, no problem.
Just give me time. It's expensive.

491
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:37,704
That's the thing, you know?

492
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,210
You're so expensive?
- I'm really expensive!

493
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,254
OK, but I'm going to give you a cacao.
- OK. OK.

494
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,097
So now just show me
what you have just learned already?

495
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:51,184
Ah, come on...!
- And then... Please! Hey, come on.

496
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,471
Come on, come on!
- I've also showed my skill.

497
00:41:55,722 --> 00:42:00,319
I just showed my skills already.
Now it's your turn.

498
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,236
It's just fair, you know?

499
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,444
OK, I take a chair, and...

500
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,951
...then please show me some skills.

501
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:19,166
I'll be friendly.
- OK. - I'll be friendly with you.

502
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,375
Thank you.
- My pleasure.

503
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:31,182
Just look at me?
You're going to be my muse now.

504
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:35,683
I'm your muse. OK. I am.
What can I do?

505
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,524
I don't know. Look at me.
- OK. I'll just...

506
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:13,879
I never, ever... I never hear
something like this before. Really.

507
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:23,434
Show me your hands.
It's like wonder hands.

508
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,099
Really!
- They're just hands.

509
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,313
No.

510
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,618
What's the name of the song?

511
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,413
It's "Mephisto Waltz". You know?

512
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,706
Mephisto?
- Yes.

513
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:46,873
Mephisto, he's like a devil, huh?

514
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,003
Yeah, it's the devil.
- I like the devil.

515
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,467
Yeah, me too.

516
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,349
But one question. Really...

517
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,685
Why you don't play...?
You have to play...

518
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,855
Not why. You have to play in concert halls.

519
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,858
You have to do something like this!

520
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:16,984
That was so cool!
It was like you're telling a story.

521
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:20,741
It was like... Cool, man!

522
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,035
It's not cool.
- Wait, you have something here, on your mouth.

523
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:30,167
I'm sorry. But it was nice.

524
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,086
No, really. You have to play there.

525
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,426
I've been... I've been...
I don't know the name, how you say that.

526
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:43,051
I've been... in the conservatory, you know?

527
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,268
I was in the conservatory...

528
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:48,481
...and I cannot continue in the conservatory
because I'm not good enough.

529
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:54,233
They said me just to finish my piano career
or something like that...

530
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,158
Because they're stupid, or what?

531
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,487
No, it's OK. I prefer that.
- No, really...

532
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,331
Because it's amazing.
It's like, you know, I...

533
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,123
No, it's not amazing...

534
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:19,804
I don't know. I've been sixteen and a half years
practising playing the piano...

535
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,265
every day, like seven hours every day.

536
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:28,062
Seven is the maximum. You cannot play more
because you're gonna hurt your arms.

537
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:32,601
And it's a really hard life,
because you have no...

538
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,400
...you have no life. You have no friends.

539
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:41,485
Well, the friends are like the other guys
that are in the conservatory...

540
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,116
...but they are not your friends really.

541
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:48,286
They're like your enemies.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

542
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,203
Because they are fighting for your dream too.

543
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,423
But was it your dream... to play?

544
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,591
Not any more.

545
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:01,178
No. Because it's...
You are... You...

546
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,844
You can became a bad...

547
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:10,981
I don't know. I was just thinking, for my
friends, they should fail in their exams...

548
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:16,611
...because then I would have, like,
more opportunities for me, and it was just...

549
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,112
...because our teacher said to us that...

550
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:24,448
...just the 90% of us, we are losing our time.

551
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,905
It's really difficult to be...
- No. But I know...

552
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:31,994
It's really difficult to became
a real pianist player.

553
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:36,381
And it's better like this.
You know, when I was 12...

554
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:41,920
... I can remember, I was like an old lady...

555
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,223
...just playing always the fucking piano.

556
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,140
Hey, chin up...

557
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,142
Heads high.

558
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:56,522
For me, I just want to tell you... wait...
it was wonderful, really.

559
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,738
It was so...
One second. Wait.

560
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,107
Yo, my man.

561
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,323
I'm here, in the cafe.

562
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,914
Why did he call?

563
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:18,498
I'm in the cafe, dude!

564
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,000
Man! At the...

565
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,925
At the organic cafe.
What does he want?

566
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,677
Yeah, what do you want?

567
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,175
Hello?

568
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:39,273
What?
- No. Everything's OK.

569
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:49,658
But I'm glad to be here. In Berlin.
- That's good.

570
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:57,123
What? What happens?

571
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,260
I have to do Boxer a favour.
We have to go now to...

572
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,305
...to do some work.

573
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:15,055
Now you have to work with them?
- Yeah, I have to go. Yeah, yeah.

574
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:20,693
But are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK. I'm just thinking.

575
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,320
But it was really nice to meet you.

576
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,532
I hope, I hope...
Let's see each other again.

577
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,867
Yeah, I want to do that.

578
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:38,207
Maybe I come to you...
Yeah, what about my cacao, by the way?

579
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,546
Now... I just...

580
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:53,264
<i>OK. Go. Go.</i>

581
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,727
What's up?

582
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:02,273
He called.
- Yeah, you said!

583
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,063
Can't I just talk in peace?
- Let's go!

584
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,899
What's going on?
Do we have to meet him?

585
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,115
Of course we have to!
- Yes, but why now?

586
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,013
So let's go!
- OK!

587
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,012
OK, retard!
- Where are we going?

588
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,142
Boxer, where?
- We're going now.

589
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:43,477
We're coming, Boxer!
We're coming with you!

590
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,715
I just wanted to say goodbye.
And not goodbye. It's 'til tomorrow.

591
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,176
It was really nice.
- Yeah. For me too.

592
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:21,644
Just come tomorrow for your cacao.
- I come tomorrow, but...

593
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,441
...but not today tomorrow...
- OK.

594
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:30,190
New car. You have a new car.
- We have a new car now, yeah.

595
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:40,162
Where are you going with this car?
- We have to do something.

596
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,543
Just leave me alone...

597
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,920
I think Fuss is going to sleep in the car.

598
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,386
I don't want to, but he does...

599
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,599
Dude! What are you doing?

600
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,635
Get on with it!

601
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,221
I'll get in and shift across.

602
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:06,275
Business people! Always a little bit crazy!
- Yeah, OK.

603
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,443
Front seat?
OK!

604
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,147
Bye!
- OK, let's go.

605
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,107
Peace!
- Bye!

606
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,246
Victoria. I'm sorry!

607
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,206
Hey! Wait outside.

608
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,882
I'm very sorry.
- What?

609
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,626
Do you have a water or something?

610
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,462
Don't puke here, you retard!

611
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,798
Everything's cool.

612
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:06,350
Water, please.
- I've got water!

613
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,684
Have a drink.
Sit up.

614
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:15,021
No, the machine is not open.
I have water.

615
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,531
Fuss is really drunk.

616
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:22,574
He's drunk. It's his birthday.
- I know. I know.

617
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,828
Calm down, Fuss. Breathe deep.

618
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,535
Dude, like this.

619
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,329
Relax, everything's cool.

620
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,624
Wake up, man!

621
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,214
Maybe the cacao's for him.

622
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,425
Get your shit together.
We've got ten minutes.

623
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:43,140
He'll make it!

624
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,555
Man! Just fuck it!

625
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,650
Call him and tell him it's off! Fuck it!

626
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,357
We can't!
- We don't have to do it tonight!

627
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,563
He wants four of us!
- But not tonight!

628
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,690
I gave him my word!

629
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,193
Boys! Relax!
- Don't let me down!

630
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,745
Don't let me down!
Get up, man!

631
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,874
Boxer, three's enough!
He just wants us in and out...

632
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,456
He doesn't want any stress!

633
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,583
What happens? What's going on?

634
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:14,788
Fuss isn't going to be any help.

635
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,799
Just call him and postpone it!

636
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,887
We can't postpone!
I owe him!

637
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:24,173
You know what I mean!

638
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,425
What happened?

639
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:31,598
Let's just go, the three of us,
bang bang, and out!

640
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,687
Right, Boxer?

641
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,606
Three? Three guys! One driver!

642
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,817
What don't you get?

643
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,239
What happened?

644
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,363
Tell me.

645
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,740
Ask her to come along.
I don't care.

646
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,659
Quick job, then back to the cafe.

647
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:55,288
Ask her!
- Are you crazy? We just met!

648
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:56,588
Just do it!

649
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,883
Don't touch me, retard!
I hate that!

650
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,552
Boxer, don't touch me!

651
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,756
Ask her!
- I will. Shut the fuck up!

652
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,094
Sonne, what happened?

653
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,683
Come on, Fuss, let's go.
- What happened?

654
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,433
Get out!
- Just fuck off!

655
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,148
Hey, wait. No, no. It's OK.
Just let them go.

656
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:17,647
You know...

657
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:27,077
You don't have to do this.
Really, you don't have to do this, but...

658
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,866
Boxer, he was in jail, yeah?

659
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:35,662
And there was some guys
giving him protections, like...

660
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:40,207
...the guys do him a favour...

661
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,878
...now he have to do something for him.
For this guy.

662
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:47,807
And now we have to go there with four guys...

663
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,059
...and Fuss is completely...

664
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,101
Man, fuck you! Wait.

665
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,556
Piss off!
I'm asking her now!

666
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,937
Then let's go!

667
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,606
You know...?

668
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,697
You know...?
You just have to...

669
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:13,536
Please can you help us?
We just go there...

670
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:16,703
...and after this bring you back
to the cafe no problem.

671
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,629
We just need now help because...

672
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:23,838
... Boxer is in trouble if not, you know.
- OK.

673
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:28,635
And you need to be four?
- Yeah. I don't know why.

674
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:32,468
I just drive you there and then I come back?

675
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,514
We bring you back. We bring you back, no problem.
- OK.

676
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,941
No problem.
- Yeah?

677
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:47,817
It's something bad to do, or...?

678
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:55,575
We've got five minutes.
Five fucking minutes.

679
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:06,173
It's something not... After, maybe
it's something bad. But it's not about you.

680
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,672
You know, we just go there and bring you back.

681
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,180
Really, that's not bad for you. OK?

682
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,771
Really. I swear. It's not bad for you.
- OK. I go. - Yeah?

683
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,493
I was talking to a girl, you wanker.

684
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,617
Are you stupid?
I was asking her!

685
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:39,376
And don't talk to me like a retard!
I hate that!

686
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,169
She's doing it!
- Just calm down.

687
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,081
You need to calm down!
- You both need to calm down.

688
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,011
Sister, you drive.
- Yeah, I drive.

689
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,890
I'm the big driver!
Are you OK, right, guys?

690
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,884
We are perfect!

691
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,306
Let her drive!

692
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:02,232
Let her drive. You don't have
a license, you stupid wanker!

693
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,611
Do you know how to drive automatic?
- Yeah, of course!

694
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:10,529
You can drive?
- Of course. I'm the fucking driver!

695
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,155
You will see.
- Everything is cool, sister.

696
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,283
What?

697
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,750
I don't like it.
- How is that?

698
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,049
He's such a moron.

699
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,799
What happens with him?

700
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,898
How do you say 'gerade aus'?

701
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,145
Just straight, man.

702
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,860
Straight?
- Just go.

703
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,942
I'm gonna drive you, man.

704
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,282
Now be nice to her, please!

705
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:01,283
Where's Fuss?

706
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,913
Fuss, brother?

707
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:06,668
Can you all be quiet a moment?

708
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:10,250
Fuss is knocked out, but it's OK.

709
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,383
Quit laughing, man!

710
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,934
What do you have to do there?

711
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,526
It's just a meeting.

712
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,401
Go right?
- Yes, right.

713
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,241
Dude, she got it!
Just tell her she's safe, OK?

714
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:40,740
Shut the fuck up.
I took care of that, wanker.

715
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:44,035
Yeah, man, Boxer,
he really did.

716
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,543
We'll just talk there, right?

717
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,337
So what are we doing?
- No plan, dude!

718
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:00,017
He wants to see we're ready.
- Exactly. It's a test!

719
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,139
Thanks for your wisdom, Blinker!

720
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,642
Calm the fuck down!

721
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:18,277
Afterwards we're bringing
her straight back.

722
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:23,498
I don't want...
I don't want to talk about it.

723
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:26,952
Sonne, of course we'll bring her back!

724
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,123
I don't want to talk about it.

725
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:51,102
I'm fucked.
No: I'm good!

726
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:56,238
We're meeting a real gangster.
That's interesting!

727
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,986
Shut! The fuck! Up!

728
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:05,032
Got it, Boxer.
Everything's cool.

729
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,834
Give me another, please.

730
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:10,496
Stop frightening the girl, retard!

731
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,205
We're not frightening her.

732
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,637
Where are we going?

733
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,093
Where are you going, man?
With this shitty stolen car?

734
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,719
Boxer, where are we going?

735
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,649
Stop calling it a fucking stolen car.
It'll scare her.

736
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,019
She doesn't understand,
so shut the fuck up.

737
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,655
Sonne?
- What?

738
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:43,904
Wait, wait, wait! Here.

739
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,493
You're not afraid, are you?
- I'm not afraid.

740
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,499
Put the car...

741
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,911
Here inside?
- More, more, more...

742
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,335
OK, stop.

743
01:03:56,166 --> 01:04:00,421
Sonne, we'll make it.
Give me five.

744
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,930
Victoria, everything OK?

745
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,436
It's OK, right?
- Yeah, it's OK.

746
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,143
Are you OK, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

747
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,577
OK, give me a light, please.

748
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:30,541
Here, hang on.

749
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,634
He has a gun.
- Just go.

750
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,286
Shit.

751
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,081
Shit!

752
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,214
Do we wait inside?

753
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,964
Are you fucking serious?

754
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,217
Get out.

755
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,102
I'll be in touch.

756
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,131
These are your boys?
- Yes.

757
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,875
Who's the bitch?

758
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,886
Are you guys fucking her?
- The bitch is our driver.

759
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,176
You don't say.
Get out.

760
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,473
You're the driver?
Done this before?

761
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,562
I don't speak German.

762
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,440
What the fuck?
She doesn't speak German?

763
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,496
Your problem.

764
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,706
Let's get your tools.

765
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,723
Hand them round.
- Are they loaded?

766
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,681
Yes. You wanna throw candy?

767
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,266
Come with me.

768
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,107
The bitch, too.

769
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:08,491
What's happening?
- Everything is OK. Just be quiet.

770
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:27,045
This is the floor plan for a private bank,
Limburg & Co, Zimmerstrasse 26.

771
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:31,428
There's 50.000 Euro in a small safe
for a customer, Mr Weigert.

772
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:35,428
He'll collect the money at 7 am
to buy a vintage car.

773
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,470
You'll be there already.

774
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,186
Ten grand's for me.
The rest is for you.

775
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,363
Right now?

776
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,783
Yes. You got something better to do?

777
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,285
Well...

778
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,290
You don't have to.
I can't force you.

779
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,636
Then we won't.
We won't do it.

780
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:15,013
Boxer, back in jail you
enjoyed my protection.

781
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:19,054
You owe me. Ten grand.
And I want that money.

782
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,977
I'll get the money.

783
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:28,314
You had no money for cigarettes
and now you'll find ten grand?

784
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,489
Give me a week, OK?

785
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,658
One week? OK.

786
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,366
While you're getting the money,

787
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,622
I'll keep the bitch.

788
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:48,966
We'll do it.
We'll do it!

789
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,550
Hey, we'll do it, OK?

790
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,056
We'll do it, man!

791
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,936
OK. Are you sure?
- Yes.

792
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:06,442
Yes.
- Good.

793
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:11,072
So, this is the entrance.
ATM, two security doors.

794
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,861
Here's the counter.

795
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:17,446
Six desks for the account managers.
Over here is the main target.

796
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:21,917
Mrs Neumann sits here.
She's the bank manager.

797
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:26,755
She has the alarm codes
and the combination for the small safe.

798
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:29,878
Mr Weigert will collect the money at 7 am.

799
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:33,837
Mrs Neumann and two clerks
will be in the bank then.

800
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:37,219
The second clerk arrives
between 6:30 and 6:45.

801
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:41,724
That's your target. She'll bring you
through the second security door.

802
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:47,393
Alright? There's gloves and masks.
Show me what you've got.

803
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,321
You stay here.

804
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,655
She stays with me.
- Yes.

805
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,705
I hate you.

806
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,421
Gimme that shit!

807
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:19,432
Take some gloves.
- Got 'em.

808
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,969
We don't have much time.
- Yes!

809
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,638
OK, boss.

810
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,318
Shit!

811
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:36,991
Should we start in the car?

812
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,362
Whatever.
- Let's start inside.

813
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,959
Wait, the gloves!

814
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,287
Go!

815
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,007
Wait, wait!
- Open the door!

816
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,301
Open the door!
- Do it yourself!

817
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,178
The lock, dude!

818
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,634
Come on, come on!

819
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:07,806
Let's go!
Everybody on the ground!

820
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,063
Shut the fuck up!
- No one make a move!

821
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,354
Down on the ground!

822
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,152
Shut the fuck up!

823
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,951
I said, down on the ground!

824
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:23,367
Give me the fucking money!
Shut up, stay down!

825
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,323
Give me the fucking money! Go!

826
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:29,752
Give me the cash!
Go! Go! Go!

827
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,631
OK, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

828
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,217
Good.
Who's the pressure guy?

829
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:38,761
Who's putting on the pressure?

830
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,880
Who's calling the shots?

831
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,594
He calls the shots.

832
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:46,644
Don't all shout at once.
Mrs Neuman needs clear instructions.

833
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:49,605
When you enter...
- The door thing won't happen again.

834
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,565
First leave the car...

835
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,439
then go. Don't run!

836
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:56,362
When you enter, two shots
to make things clear.

837
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,939
What's the bank's name?

838
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,407
Limburg.

839
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,693
Limburg & Co, Zimmerstrasse 26.

840
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,866
Bitch!
Zimmerstrasse 26!

841
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,166
Good.

842
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:12,829
Remember that.

843
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,798
We bring you home now, yeah? To the cafe.
- I'm OK.

844
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,345
Sorry.
- No. OK.

845
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,480
Tilidin, cocaine.

846
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:34,942
Take some.
It makes you confident and aggressive.

847
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,480
If you're busted, you'll do less time.
- You first.

848
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:41,111
Bitch, you too.

849
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:46,117
Forget the silent alarm.
You'll be out in two minutes.

850
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,702
A bit more, Boxer.

851
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,668
Give me a bit more...
A little more.

852
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,045
More, more. Another bit.

853
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,548
Time to go.

854
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,470
Give me some!

855
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:18,320
Afterwards go home and stay put.
I'll be in touch. Have fun.

856
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:21,526
Go!

857
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,642
What is this shit?

858
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,354
What is this shit?

859
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,643
Boxer?

860
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,398
Boxer, what the fuck is this shit, man?

861
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:52,614
Victoria, I'm sorry, yeah. I'm very sorry.
- Don't worry. I'm OK. Don't care.

862
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,833
So, we go to the cafe, yeah?

863
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:02,840
Boxer. Man, I can't breathe!

864
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:06,590
My heart!
I can't breathe!

865
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,763
Stop the car!
- Don't stop the car!

866
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,722
Don't stop the car!

867
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,848
My heart! Stop the car!

868
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,736
I stop the car!
- Don't stop the car! Don't stop the car!

869
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,987
He's panicking! He's panicking!
- Stop the car! Stop the car!

870
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,746
I'm not joking!
I'm not joking!

871
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:36,783
I'm not joking!
Open the fucking door.

872
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,004
Boxer, Boxer, I can't.

873
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,132
Help. My heart.

874
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,093
Calm the fuck down!

875
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:59,730
Get up, man! Get up!

876
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:03,396
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

877
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:06,070
Get Up!

878
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,777
Wait.

879
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:13,699
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

880
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:25,507
Breathe.
Breathe. Blinker, breathe.

881
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,266
<i>Stop m.</i>

882
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,446
I don't want to die.

883
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,741
Guys, what's going on?

884
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:08,959
Give me the fucking cigarette.

885
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,591
I'll do it alone.

886
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,724
I come with you. I drive you.

887
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:53,424
Guys, for once:
everyone together.

888
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,176
Come here.
Blinker, come here!

889
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,516
Blinker, come here, man!

890
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:02,808
No, let's go, let's go!

891
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,310
Relax, for once.

892
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,324
But we're taking her back first!

893
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:26,411
Sonne, I want to go with you.

894
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,913
Get up, man.

895
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:34,419
OK, man. I'm coming.

896
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,532
Straight on?
- No. Left.

897
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,453
I'll take Mrs Neumann.

898
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,963
I'll take Mrs Neumann...

899
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:01,093
You keep the others covered.

900
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:04,182
We're doing this.
We're going to make it, OK?

901
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:09,185
Nice and easy. In and out. Two minutes.

902
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,437
OK?
- Yes, man!

903
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,856
OK, brother!
- Yeah?

904
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,694
Go straight.

905
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:14,081
It has to be there.

906
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:18,708
Go. Go, go. Go.

907
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,305
Go here. Stop right here.

908
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,099
More. Go.

909
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:36,525
Blinker, everything alright?
- What?

910
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:42,862
Here turn the car, and you stop, OK.
And you wait. We come and we go.

911
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,489
You turn around, OK?

912
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,410
I already told her.

913
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,252
Blinker, you're OK?
- Yes.

914
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:04,678
Hey. Blinker.
- I'm calm, I'm calm, I'm calm...

915
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,555
Is that her?

916
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:16,599
Hey! Wait!

917
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,484
Hey, that's her!

918
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:26,317
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!

919
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:41,048
Down on the ground!
I said, get down on the ground!

920
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:05,549
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Come on!

921
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:10,262
The car, the car is not going on!
The car is not going on!

922
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:18,221
Boxer! The car is not going on!
The car is not fucking going on! Come on!

923
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,432
Man, just drive!

924
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,271
Drive! Drive! Drive!

925
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,646
Why don't you go?
Go! Go! Go!

926
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:35,530
Drive slow! Hey! Slow! OK. Here!

927
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,702
Left. Go left!

928
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:43,916
Slow!

929
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:52,672
Throw your jacket out!
Throw your fucking jacket away!

930
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:55,048
Throw it out!
Throw it out!

931
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,718
Throw everything out!
Throw everything out!

932
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:02,898
OK, now go right! Here! Here!
Right! Go here!

933
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,103
Calm down.

934
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,491
No, no! Go back, go back! Go back.

935
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:20,912
What the fuck?
- Go back, sister. Go back. Go back.

936
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:23,252
Relax, please!

937
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:26,251
Calm down, OK'? Calm down.

938
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,550
Calm down! Calm down!

939
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,894
Sister, you go back.
- Hey, calm down!

940
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:43,431
Just think! Where are we going?

941
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:48,353
We've got to get off the streets!

942
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,070
Go safely, sister.

943
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,243
Right!
- Go here to the right!

944
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:07,538
Let's get out of here!
- Hide! Get down!

945
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:18,216
Hey, now. Here right. Here. Here.

946
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:32,772
Go here. Go in here.
Let's hide the car.

947
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,364
Behind this, OK?
Go, go, go. Behind this.

948
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,957
Stop the car.
- Stop you the car!

949
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,990
Everything was OK?

950
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,203
Boxer, you whore.

951
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:28,418
50.000 Euros!

952
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,626
A pharmacy bag.

953
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:48,397
That was some sick shit.
Show me: how much we got?

954
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:55,480
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

955
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:59,988
Hey, guys!
I just want to say I love you.

956
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:04,284
Boys, let's get going.
Grab your fucking guns!

957
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:10,877
Guys! Sonne! Sonne!

958
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:14,047
Grab all the shit.
Just take everything.

959
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:17,467
Grab the gun and don't leave a trace.

960
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:19,962
Wipe them off!

961
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:43,989
Let's go party, man!

962
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,322
We do it!

963
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:49,074
Let's go party!

964
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,668
Wait, wait!
- Alright, man.

965
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:57,379
Now, I think... we need a drink!

966
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,468
I think so, yeah.
- You think also? - Yeah!

967
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:02,717
Throw away this shit.

968
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,802
My jacket!
- Throw it away, dude.

969
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,099
Hey, man!
- Fuck it.

970
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,998
You're so fucking crazy!

971
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:42,382
A bit of pocket money?

972
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:48,016
Give me some pocket money.

973
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:51,223
Let me see!

974
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:54,056
You're so fucking crazy.

975
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:57,817
Evening.

976
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:02,239
Sister, where you go?
- I don't know where I'm going, what I'm doing!

977
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,861
We go partying'?

978
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,453
Get going!

979
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:23,092
Six Euros!

980
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:27,927
It's us again!
Here's one hundred. And two hundred.

981
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:32,932
Good evening!
- Remember? You wouldn't let us in!

982
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:39,268
Here you are.
Take it, take it, take it, brother.

983
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:47,238
Give me a whisky, dude!
Just give me whisky, please.

984
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:50,946
Give me everything you've got.
- Give me two whiskies.

985
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:08,211
I told you, the club belongs to me!

986
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:31,856
It's over now.

987
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:33,482
What do you mean, it's over?

988
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:38,655
Of course it's over. That's why we're partying.

989
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:41,327
Sorry, it happens sometimes.

990
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,037
Our day is over!

991
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:45,490
Yeah! These guys? These guys? Fire!
These guys? Fire!

992
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,167
Come on, get on with it!
This isn't your kind of place.

993
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:51,037
What's up with you?
- Come on! Off you go!

994
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:56,127
We're dressed and ready to go!

995
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:58,962
Dressed and ready to go!

996
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:02,090
Let's go!

997
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:10,269
Get out!

998
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:14,773
Let her down, man.

999
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:20,109
I don't want to go!
I don't want to go

1000
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:23,987
The place is ours!
- We go, we go, we go!

1001
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,714
Boxer, I'm looking at your ass!

1002
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:45,600
Hey, man, don't push it!

1003
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:55,105
Don't touch my hair, please!

1004
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,942
What are you doing?
You want to fight me?

1005
01:36:59,105 --> 01:37:01,824
You want to fight with me?
I can kick your ass, OK?

1006
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:03,693
Hang on a second.

1007
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,820
Did you see that?
Give me a kiss.

1008
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:23,471
We go party!
We go party!

1009
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:26,390
We go party!
We go to the roof!

1010
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:27,929
Blinker, brother!

1011
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:32,059
Let's check what Fuss is doing,
you stupid morons!

1012
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:35,817
Oh, my God! Fuss!
He's still in the car!

1013
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:44,026
I totally forgot about him!

1014
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,782
I completely forgot him!

1015
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:52,242
Hey, Blinker, you retard!

1016
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:54,502
Man! Blinker! Man!

1017
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:14,435
Just run slowly!
- OK, OK, OK.

1018
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:18,397
Fuck your shoes.
- Don't panic. Act normal!

1019
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:36,290
Blinker, hey!

1020
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:37,544
Blinker! Come on!

1021
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,664
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1022
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:42,425
Stay calm! Stay calm!

1023
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,222
We'll make it!

1024
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:50,391
Pull your fucking trousers up, man!

1025
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:53,937
Where did they come from?

1026
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:02,153
What do we have to do now?
- Just go.

1027
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:04,731
We fucked up!
Really fucked up!

1028
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:06,608
We go to the roof now?
- Yeah.

1029
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:32,388
Cops.
I swear on my mother's grave!

1030
01:39:33,009 --> 01:39:35,933
Cops!
- Wait! Stop shouting!

1031
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:42,147
What? What? What?

1032
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,520
Wait! Shit!

1033
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:47,274
Wait!

1034
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:51,410
Go! Go, man!
Move your fucking ass!

1035
01:39:58,117 --> 01:39:59,994
Don't run!

1036
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:14,346
Go! Run! Run!

1037
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:17,970
Go left!

1038
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,056
Left, man!

1039
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:23,935
Fuck you!

1040
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:27,067
Police! Freeze! Stop!
Throw your guns down!

1041
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:28,235
Fuck off!

1042
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:32,577
Stay where you are!

1043
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:36,072
Drop your weapons!

1044
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:41,286
Stay where you are!
Drop the gun!

1045
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:42,378
Freeze!

1046
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:43,246
Blinker!

1047
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:44,747
Sonne!

1048
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:48,005
Fuck you, you wanker!

1049
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:50,803
Put your weapons down
and come out now!

1050
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,802
You bastards!

1051
01:40:57,552 --> 01:40:59,225
Sonne!

1052
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:03,559
Come out!
You don't stand a chance.

1053
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:05,735
Come out with your hands up!

1054
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:09,735
Stop!

1055
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:11,282
Stay where you are!

1056
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,743
Leave the money!

1057
01:41:13,943 --> 01:41:16,071
Come on!
- Drop the gun!

1058
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:19,115
Drop the gun, or I'll shoot!

1059
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:25,917
Boxer, come here!

1060
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:28,215
<i>Come on!</i>

1061
01:41:35,298 --> 01:41:36,094
Where? Where?

1062
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:37,516
There's no way out!

1063
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:39,685
Where, man? Where?

1064
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:43,480
Sonne!

1065
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:46,605
Help me!

1066
01:41:47,393 --> 01:41:48,610
Fuck off!

1067
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:51,359
Fuck off!

1068
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:54,484
Throw your guns away!

1069
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:02,374
Put down your guns!
Come out with your hands up!

1070
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,620
Take the money!
- You're coming with us!

1071
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:09,332
You're coming with us!
You're coming with us!

1072
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,588
Just get the fuck out of here!

1073
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:19,141
Go! Go!

1074
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:21,810
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

1075
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:27,475
Come. Come.
Go. Go.

1076
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:48,413
They're cops! They're cops.

1077
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:51,666
Upstairs. Upstairs.

1078
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:54,176
Here are the cops.

1079
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:56,462
Come here. Come, come, come, come.

1080
01:43:03,386 --> 01:43:05,263
Don't look at me.
Turn around.

1081
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:07,186
Where do you live?
- Upstairs. Upstairs!

1082
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:10,310
Where do you live!
- Upstairs, one floor up!

1083
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:12,111
Let us in!

1084
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:15,490
Move your ass! Go, go, go!
- OK, OK!

1085
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:20,244
Hurry "P!

1086
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:23,823
On the floor!
Shut the fuck up! In the living room!

1087
01:43:26,826 --> 01:43:28,169
You too!

1088
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:33,916
Shut the fuck up!
Stay on the ground!

1089
01:43:34,792 --> 01:43:36,794
Stay on the ground!
Don't look at me!

1090
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:39,300
Don't look at me!
OK'?

1091
01:43:39,422 --> 01:43:42,676
Shut the fuck up!
Shut...

1092
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:59,400
Why'd you let me
into your shitty flat with a baby, man?

1093
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:00,951
I don't know...

1094
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:05,998
Are you stupid?
You can't let me in when there's a baby here!

1095
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,252
How stupid are you?

1096
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:16,960
How stupid are you, man?

1097
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:22,840
Shut the fuck up.

1098
01:44:24,967 --> 01:44:27,470
Shut the fuck up.

1099
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:43,869
It's over.

1100
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:48,119
It's over.

1101
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:58,426
So stupid. It was stupid.

1102
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:04,390
Shut the fuck up!
Sonne, shut the fuck up.

1103
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:16,607
Well, we're finished.

1104
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:23,909
Attention, residents! This is the police!

1105
01:45:24,068 --> 01:45:28,494
Please stay in your homes.
Keep your doors closed.

1106
01:45:28,656 --> 01:45:32,706
Don't let anyone in!

1107
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:37,336
We will inform you once
the situation is under control.

1108
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:42,847
Attention, residents! This is the police!
Secure your doors and windows.

1109
01:46:06,151 --> 01:46:09,451
Listen. Listen to me.

1110
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:14,372
I'm going to take your baby.
Listen to me!

1111
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:17,921
No!

1112
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,754
Come. Listen to me.

1113
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,001
Listen to me.

1114
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:24,387
Look at me!
- Not my baby.

1115
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:27,924
We are good people.
We need your help, now. Right now!

1116
01:46:28,007 --> 01:46:29,350
Not my baby!

1117
01:46:29,425 --> 01:46:31,098
Look at me!

1118
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:34,180
Your baby's going to be OK!

1119
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:36,974
Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1120
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:41,020
Shut the fuck up! Please! Please!

1121
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:43,777
Listen to me!

1122
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:47,944
I'm going to take the baby
because we need your help...

1123
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:51,031
...and I'm going to leave your baby there!

1124
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:57,624
Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on!
Come on! Come on!

1125
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:07,050
OK. Listen to me. OK?

1126
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:10,008
Your baby's going to be...
Hey, hey. Listen.

1127
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:13,807
Your baby's going to be OK. I promise.

1128
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:16,397
We need your help.
We just need to go out.

1129
01:47:16,513 --> 01:47:20,609
Your baby's going to be in that store
in five minutes.

1130
01:47:20,726 --> 01:47:24,981
I promise. I promise to you.
We need just your help, please.

1131
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:30,119
Listen up!
Give us the baby!

1132
01:47:31,403 --> 01:47:33,576
Give us...!
- No, no! Please, Sonne! No!

1133
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:35,916
OK, wait!

1134
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:42,748
Take the baby! Take the baby!

1135
01:47:55,928 --> 01:47:57,771
Yeah, come on!
- I've got it!

1136
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:59,898
Put it here! Put it here! Put it here!

1137
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:02,943
Where's the money?

1138
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,157
Everything's OK.

1139
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:09,905
It's going to be OK.

1140
01:48:12,861 --> 01:48:17,332
Hey, it's OK.
Lie down! Lie down!

1141
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:18,580
Everything's OK.
No, no!

1142
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,619
Sonne, give me the fucking gun.
Give me the fucking gun!

1143
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,337
Give me the fucking gun!

1144
01:48:22,454 --> 01:48:25,253
Shut the fuck up!
Shut your fucking mouth!

1145
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:29,257
He's going to be OK.
He's going to be OK, I promise.

1146
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:39,183
Go.

1147
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:58,115
Police!

1148
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:00,959
Stay where you are!
Hands up.

1149
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:03,746
Take a step down.

1150
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,548
Stop, stop.

1151
01:49:06,749 --> 01:49:11,505
Sparrowhawk to HQ?
I've got two individuals in the hall.

1152
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:14,597
Two youths...

1153
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:19,766
No. HQ, I need a
situation report now!

1154
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:25,651
I've got two individuals, mid twenties.
- We live here.

1155
01:49:25,851 --> 01:49:29,025
They have a baby.
- We live here.

1156
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:32,529
Give me a description!

1157
01:49:32,941 --> 01:49:36,571
They've got colourful clothing and a baby.

1158
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:41,163
Come down here, please.
- We live here.

1159
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:45,213
What happened?
What happened?

1160
01:49:48,832 --> 01:49:50,880
Secure upstairs.
- What happened?

1161
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,803
Stay here.
You'll be picked up.

1162
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:57,429
My colleagues will pick you up.
Just stay here.

1163
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:24,080
We have to go here.
There's policemen everywhere. Yeah.

1164
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:27,421
Yeah, but come, come.

1165
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:35,638
They told us to get out fast!

1166
01:50:35,838 --> 01:50:37,556
Move around the corner.

1167
01:50:37,673 --> 01:50:38,925
Yes.

1168
01:50:39,007 --> 01:50:41,180
Take it. Take it. Take it.

1169
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:55,323
Where's the... Where's the gun?
- Here.

1170
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:01,572
Shit!

1171
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:35,196
Morning.
- Good morning.

1172
01:51:35,731 --> 01:51:37,278
Good morning.

1173
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,367
Greetings, sir.
- Hello!

1174
01:51:39,443 --> 01:51:42,993
Straight on for now.
- OK.

1175
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:47,125
Just straight on...

1176
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:50,462
and then left...

1177
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:00,923
Your first fare?
- No, my last.

1178
01:52:01,006 --> 01:52:02,599
Yeah?
- Left here?

1179
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:04,935
Yes, just go left.

1180
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,805
You got it.

1181
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:26,745
Can you just take us...?

1182
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:30,829
Just take us to a hotel.

1183
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:35,295
What kind? Fifty or five hundred Euro?
- Doesn't matter.

1184
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:37,593
Round here?
- Yeah.

1185
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:38,840
OK.

1186
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:43,382
Then let's try the Westin.

1187
01:52:44,299 --> 01:52:46,597
It's just round the corner.

1188
01:52:47,552 --> 01:52:49,475
Sweet.

1189
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:27,017
Are you OK?
- Good.

1190
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:31,852
I'm OK. Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1191
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:38,778
Give me the money.

1192
01:54:02,544 --> 01:54:05,514
I'll give you a hundred.

1193
01:54:05,756 --> 01:54:08,134
I can't change that.

1194
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:11,637
Ah, no problem!

1195
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:15,517
Why, thank you!
- We just came from the slot machines.

1196
01:54:17,726 --> 01:54:19,603
Very generous!

1197
01:54:25,067 --> 01:54:29,322
So, here we are.
- Perfect.

1198
01:54:30,906 --> 01:54:34,627
OK. Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

1199
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:36,666
Yes.
- Bye.

1200
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:38,080
Bye.

1201
01:54:38,455 --> 01:54:41,584
We're going into a hotel?
- We go in...

1202
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:45,921
Come, let's go.

1203
01:54:48,006 --> 01:54:50,805
Let's relax a little bit.

1204
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:59,063
Bye.
- Bye.

1205
01:55:14,282 --> 01:55:18,037
Do you have a passport?
- Passport? No.

1206
01:55:18,286 --> 01:55:22,336
We need a passport.
We need a passport to check in.

1207
01:55:23,458 --> 01:55:26,382
That's a problem.
- No, no. Don't worry.

1208
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:29,473
You give me the money and I organise a room.

1209
01:55:29,673 --> 01:55:31,141
Yeah. Come.

1210
01:55:46,148 --> 01:55:49,322
I'll come in a minute.
- Yeah.

1211
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:52,282
Give me the money.

1212
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:56,866
I'm going to tell them a story
and organise a room.

1213
01:57:57,028 --> 01:57:58,826
Good.

1214
01:58:56,671 --> 01:58:58,673
Hey. Let's go.
- Now? - Yeah.

1215
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:00,805
I have a room.

1216
01:59:01,468 --> 01:59:03,436
Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1217
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:05,146
Yeah? OK.

1218
01:59:07,682 --> 01:59:09,434
Wait.
- Yeah

1219
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:15,156
It's this way.

1220
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:21,409
Hey. How are you? Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1221
01:59:21,655 --> 01:59:23,578
Sure?
- Yeah!

1222
01:59:33,124 --> 01:59:35,752
Sonne, are you OK?
- Yeah.

1223
01:59:37,712 --> 01:59:41,182
Are you bleeding? Fuck!
Are you bleeding?

1224
01:59:41,549 --> 01:59:45,179
Nothing. No, no.
- Show me. Show me.

1225
01:59:45,428 --> 01:59:48,181
I just have to lay down.

1226
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:57,946
Are you OK?

1227
01:59:59,776 --> 02:00:03,497
Are you OK or not?
Tell me the truth.

1228
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:05,490
Go. Go.

1229
02:00:05,907 --> 02:00:08,751
Go! Go, go!
- Wait!

1230
02:00:09,577 --> 02:00:10,920
<i>Come on!</i>

1231
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:18,299
It's there. OK?

1232
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:22,549
Can you walk?
- Hey? I'm good now.

1233
02:00:23,299 --> 02:00:25,893
I'm good.
- Sure? - Yeah.

1234
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:30,898
It's cold.

1235
02:00:32,308 --> 02:00:33,309
OK. Come.

1236
02:00:37,939 --> 02:00:39,816
OK. Let's go.

1237
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:03,556
Wait.

1238
02:01:12,557 --> 02:01:16,482
Come. Come.
Come on. Sonne, let's go.

1239
02:01:16,853 --> 02:01:18,901
I just lay down.
- Yes.

1240
02:01:19,063 --> 02:01:21,737
The bed, it's there. Go.

1241
02:01:27,906 --> 02:01:30,375
In the bed! There! Go!

1242
02:01:33,787 --> 02:01:36,040
Wait.

1243
02:01:39,209 --> 02:01:41,507
Come. Come.

1244
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:44,255
Sonne!

1245
02:01:47,091 --> 02:01:49,970
It's cold. Cold.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

1246
02:01:50,762 --> 02:01:51,979
Cold.

1247
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:56,605
Show me that. Really.

1248
02:01:59,103 --> 02:02:00,776
You have to go to the hospital.

1249
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:24,258
I'm going to bring you water.

1250
02:02:37,141 --> 02:02:42,774
...the police identified the getaway car,
which led to the first thief's arrest.

1251
02:02:43,982 --> 02:02:49,204
There was a shootout between police and
the thieves here in Kochstrasse...

1252
02:02:49,320 --> 02:02:54,167
One of the thieves died at the scene,
another one on the way to the hospital...

1253
02:02:54,534 --> 02:02:59,543
Two suspects, a man and a woman in
their twenties, are still at large. Police...

1254
02:03:12,844 --> 02:03:16,724
Sonne. Do you want some water?
Do you want some...?

1255
02:03:31,362 --> 02:03:33,706
Sonne. Sonne.

1256
02:03:34,032 --> 02:03:36,410
We have to go to the hospital, right now!
- No!

1257
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:38,704
Yes! We have to go to the hospital right now.

1258
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:41,544
No! No!
- You are going to die. You look like that.

1259
02:03:48,504 --> 02:03:50,552
Come here!

1260
02:03:50,632 --> 02:03:52,100
Sonne. Sonne.

1261
02:03:52,383 --> 02:03:54,727
Listen, listen.

1262
02:03:55,178 --> 02:03:59,103
You go... You go now...
You take the money.

1263
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:02,401
What?

1264
02:04:05,271 --> 02:04:10,699
Nobody knows who you are.
Take the money. Go to Spain. You go. Go!

1265
02:04:13,738 --> 02:04:17,117
Sonne, I'm going to call
a fucking ambulance, OK?

1266
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:29,174
Hi. We need an ambulance right now.
Yeah. Yeah, right now! Yeah!

1267
02:04:47,981 --> 02:04:49,073
Sonne. Sonne.

1268
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:54,074
OK, listen. Listen.

1269
02:04:54,195 --> 02:04:58,416
They are on their way. They're coming.
Sonne, look at me!

1270
02:04:58,616 --> 02:05:02,666
Sonne, look at me. Hey!
Stay with me, OK? They're coming.

1271
02:05:02,912 --> 02:05:05,415
They are on their way.

1272
02:05:05,873 --> 02:05:08,672
Stay. Hey.

1273
02:05:09,335 --> 02:05:12,965
Look at me. Stay with me.

1274
02:05:14,674 --> 02:05:17,553
Sonne, stay. Sonne, stay with me. Stay!

1275
02:05:17,927 --> 02:05:21,306
Stay. Sonne, stay.

1276
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:25,727
Stay! Stay!

1277
02:05:28,813 --> 02:05:29,814
Stay!

1278
02:05:31,941 --> 02:05:35,696
Stay. No, stay.

1279
02:05:36,112 --> 02:05:37,739
Sonne, stay.

1280
02:05:41,784 --> 02:05:44,333
Stay with me. Stay.

1281
02:05:45,997 --> 02:05:47,340
Stay.

1282
02:05:50,334 --> 02:05:51,711
Stay.
