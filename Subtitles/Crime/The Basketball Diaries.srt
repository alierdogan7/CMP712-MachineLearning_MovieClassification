starting to emerge.

1291
01:09:35,607 --> 01:09:39,805
So with last night's victory
over Boston, next week the Beers
must beat lndianapolis...

1292
01:09:39,878 --> 01:09:43,939
to advance to Charlotte--
that's in an effort to reduce
their magic number to three.

1293
01:09:44,016 --> 01:09:48,350

to the National Eastern Division
North to play Tampa.

and Denver beats Atlanta...

1295

in the American Southwestern
Division East Northern,

1296

then Milwaukee goes
to the Denslow Cup,

1297

unless Baltimore upsets Buffalo
and Charlotte ties Toronto.

1298
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:02,225
Then Oakland would play
L.A. and Pittsburgh
in a blind choice round-robin.

1299

lf no clear winner emerges
from all this, the two-man
