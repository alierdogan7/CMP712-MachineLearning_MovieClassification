1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,913
Check this out.

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,592
I'm the only truck in town
that's got soft-serve.

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,761
I know what you're thinking,

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,554
but I got a great deal on this truck.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,022
I'm thinking I haven't seen
you this excited

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:16,516
since I took you to the Bronx zoo

7
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,359
for your eighth birthday.

8
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:21,895
I know you were worried
about me, okay?

9
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:24,531
But you don't need to be,
not anymore.

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,100
I knew you'd turn it around.

11
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,292
There you go, sweet pea.

12
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:36,410
Oh.

13
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:38,121
- Here.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:39,713
Enjoy.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,166
Ice cream sandwich.

16
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,007
Hey.

17
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:51,218
Sir!

18
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,093
- Hey, I need two vanilla cones.
- Okay.

19
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:56,813
Sorry.
Just give me a sec.

20
00:00:56,898 --> 00:00:58,725
Hello?

21
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,634
Hello?

22
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:25,752
Without further ado,

23
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:28,161
I give you one of this organization's

24
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,930
biggest champions,

25
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:32,259
senator Charles Irving.

26
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,170
He's got a gun!

27
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:48,682
Darren!

28
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,339
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

29
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,005
"Hey, Birkhoff,
I need to use your computer.

30
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,206
Is that cool?"

31
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,635
"Sure, Nikki.
Thanks for asking."

32
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,179
Birkhoff, I need to borrow
100 grand.

33
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,395
Is that cool?

34
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:20,599
See how easy that--
wait a minute. What?

35
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,316
We have a lead
that could help us identify

36
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:23,894
another member of oversight.

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,269
<i>We</i> have a lead?

38
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,237
Spain's defense minister
is doing business

39
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:28,689
with an oversight member.

40
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:31,191
One of his staffers is willing
to sell us the identity,

41
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:33,445
but he needs a lot of money
and in 24 hours.

42
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,780
So we're also gonna have to take
your jet to Lisbon.

43
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,450
Hmm.

44
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,584
No.

45
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:42,336
No?

46
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,338
Get used to that sound, baby.

47
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:46,173
'Cause I'm not joining you
on some crusade

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,626
to take down oversight.

49
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,761
And you are not taking
my jet anywhere.

50
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:52,296
Right, because this is
about you,

51
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,630
right, Shadow Walker?

52
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,183
Well, it is my life...

53
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,595
And my house.

54
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,587
In fact, I think you and Mikey

55
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,557
should start looking for new digs.

56
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:05,392
Guys...

57
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:07,270
There's something
that you need to see.

58
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,763
The suspect was shot twice

59
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,025
by the senator's security detail.

60
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,194
Eyewitnesses describe Lancaster

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,403
as being in a trance-like state.

62
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:18,406
This is P9.

63
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,040
No way.

64
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:21,491
Nobody got out alive.

65
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,703
Apparently, the kid
just suddenly changed.

66
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:25,997
People said he looked like
he was in a trance.

67
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:27,431
P9?

68
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,792
Do you remember Eustice,

69
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,450
the militia group that got
into the siege

70
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,629
with the FBI in 2003?

71
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,720
Yeah, FBI raided the compound,

72
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:35,422
and they burnt the whole cult down.

73
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:38,301
Ah, it was no cult.
That was a cover.

74
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:41,395
The compound housed a program
to breed assassins...

75
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:43,964
P9.

76
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:46,601
An assassination program
that's different from division?

77
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,979
Way more <i>x-files...</i>

78
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,398
They used a super-teched-out
version of hypnosis,

79
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,907
neurohypnotic reprogramming.

80
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,158
When they were done,

81
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:56,576
they put those people
back in the world

82
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:58,478
with no idea
what had happened to them...

83
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,331
Sleepers.

84
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,035
How do you know all this?

85
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,985
Because those weren't
FBI agents

86
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,423
who burned down the compound.

87
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,336
It was division.

88
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,128
Division was sent
to clean up P9

89
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:18,300
after a sleeper went awol and
shot two policemen in Eustice.

90
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,969
The question should be,
why has it resurfaced?

91
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,266
I take it oversight
didn't brief you on P9...

92
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,341
One of their less successful
programs.

93
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,644
So the idea was abducting
foreign nationals

94
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:32,229
and brainwashing them.

95
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,514
The idea was a clean strike.

96
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,933
Say you wanted to assassinate
the president of Pakistan.

97
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,235
Why send in seal team 6...

98
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,786
When you can get
the local ice cream man

99
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:40,864
to do it for you?

100
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,449
And then commit suicide.

101
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,691
The hits look like
random acts of violence

102
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,159
from mentally disturbed individuals.

103
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,246
Personally, I found it disgusting.

104
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:49,696
Why? Because you prefer

105
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:51,708
more old-school
brainwashing techniques?

106
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,600
Because the concept is flawed,

107
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,795
just like its creator was.

108
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,622
Oversight had hired
Dr. Joseph Mars,

109
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:02,592
a brilliant neuropsychiatrist
who specialized in brain waves.

110
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,511
He was killed
along with everyone else.

111
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,646
Man.

112
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,849
I can still hear the sounds
from that day...Screams.

113
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,984
Clear the perimeter,
then exfil.

114
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:12,729
Copy that.

115
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,738
Yeah, I...

116
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:18,325
Supervised the raid from ops.

117
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:21,244
What happened
to those people is terrible,

118
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,240
but the chances
of this being P9, I mean...

119
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,616
They said Lancaster was happy.
He was doing well.

120
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,418
He just put 10k down
for an ice cream truck.

121
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:29,736
Does that sound like somebody

122
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,039
who's planning to commit
an assassination?

123
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,956
Birkhoff, transfer the schematics

124
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,574
for the Eustice compound to my phone.

125
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,543
That should give us
an hour or two to get there.

126
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:39,047
Michael, we leave
for Lisbon tonight, remember?

127
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,423
- Change of plans.
- Whoa.

128
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,299
We can't just drop everything
because you have a hunch, okay?

129
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,510
Our contact is waiting for us.

130
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,762
If we don't show,
he will get spooked.

131
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,013
I understand.
If P9 is back...

132
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,588
If...
Lisbon is real.

133
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,090
We've been waiting months
for a shot like this.

134
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,425
If you think Lisbon
is more important,

135
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,603
then you go.

136
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,111
If I think Lisbon's
more important?

137
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,481
Wait a minute.

138
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,449
So taking down oversight,
putting a dent in them...

139
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:01,368
All of the sudden,
not a priority for you.

140
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:02,986
If I'm right, God only knows

141
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,270
how many sleepers are out there

142
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,074
and how many assassinations
are planned.

143
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,076
Oversight can wait.
This can't.

144
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:14,447
As much as I love hosting
couples therapy,

145
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,917
you guys need to hit Craiglist.

146
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:20,213
You got to the end of the week.

147
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,970
I'm sure this is
very difficult for you.

148
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,512
I'm getting better.

149
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,557
Some wounds heal
quicker than others.

150
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,849
Something tells me
you didn't come here

151
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,394
just to talk about my health.

152
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,685
I'd like you to talk to Percy

153
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,481
about an old mission...
Operation falling ash.

154
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,490
- Is Nikita involved?
- No.

155
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,359
I'm sure you've heard
about the attempt

156
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,660
on the senator.

157
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,238
Oversight is concerned
an old pet project

158
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,446
may be to blame,

159
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:48,365
and Percy might be able
to allay their fears.

160
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,534
Think of it as a favor.

161
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,668
Friends do favors
for each other.

162
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:53,371
I don't think we're there yet.

163
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:55,005
I think your current condition
is evidence

164
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:57,123
of how fleeting friendships can be.

165
00:06:57,174 --> 00:06:58,658
Our relationship is different.

166
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,003
I'm your business partner.

167
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,505
As such, I'll provide
necessary incentive.

168
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:04,714
I don't think a pair
of $500 heels

169
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,934
is gonna do me much good right now.

170
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:09,596
What if I were to provide you
with a list

171
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,522
of the men close to Sergei Semak...

172
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:14,524
All his top brass?

173
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:21,107
Exactly what do you need me
to find out from Percy?

174
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:25,035
If there were any loose ends
on P9 or Eustice...

175
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,954
Anything else we should know.

176
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,719
I thought this
was a restricted area.

177
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:45,805
What changed your mind?

178
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:48,008
I thought about you here alone,

179
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:49,803
and I didn't like it.

180
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,562
But you still don't believe me.

181
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,767
I believe in you...

182
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,071
And in us.

183
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:04,024
What are we looking for?

184
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,558
Part of the original
objective here

185
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,612
was to retrieve the research
Dr. Mars kept on file,

186
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,530
something we failed to do in '03.

187
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:12,449
Probably because
it burnt up in the fire.

188
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,084
Maybe, maybe not.

189
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:15,919
But according to Percy's
private notes on the box,

190
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:20,406
Mars had a private safe
hidden in his office.

191
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:43,113
Have you ever read
any Dostoyevsky?

192
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:44,280
No.

193
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:46,399
Tolstoy?

194
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,736
You Russians really know
your pain, don't you?

195
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,532
I need to ask you
about an old mission.

196
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,157
At the moment,
I'm more interested

197
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:55,243
in your new wounds.

198
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,444
They look like they go deep.

199
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,797
Falling ash...
Tell me what happened.

200
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,616
You first.

201
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,753
I encountered Nikita
in the field.

202
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,047
She tried to kill you
and failed?

203
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:12,425
She tried to dissuade me
from my mission and failed.

204
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:15,138
Her tactics seem pretty brutal.

205
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,964
Have they made you
reevaluate your own?

206
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:21,985
There is a value

207
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,804
in an eye for an eye, you know...

208
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,807
Or a leg for a leg.

209
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,826
But I guess that's your problem.

210
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,947
Let's talk about mine.

211
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:34,781
If oversight wants me to fill in

212
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,983
their missing piece of the puzzle,

213
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,652
I will require the following...

214
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,539
A pot of hot water,

215
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:44,292
a bag of Earl Grey on the side,

216
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,793
every morning, 7:00 a.M.--

217
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:48,463
proper English tea.

218
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,263
You can smoke the tea leaves,
for all I care.

219
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:51,765
Just start talking.

220
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,551
We radioed the doctor,

221
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:58,171
told him to line up everyone
for extraction.

222
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,839
They thought the killers
coming through the door

223
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,893
were a rescue team.

224
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,866
No wonder this place
feels haunted.

225
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,966
Nikita.

226
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,387
Owen?

227
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,206
Owen, what are you doing here?

228
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,641
What the hell
are you doing here?

229
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,511
Answer the question.

230
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,511
I know about this place
'cause I was on the strike team

231
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:39,879
that burned it down.

232
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,731
Now answer my question.

233
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:43,309
I quarterbacked the op.

234
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,567
So you saw that kid
on the news.

235
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:46,104
You came to track down the survivor.

236
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,222
There were no survivors.

237
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,985
Owen, what survivor?

238
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,912
The guy that invented
the program...

239
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,031
Joseph Mars.

240
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:00,934
I saved his life.

241
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,188
It's ironic, isn't it,

242
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:08,960
but an organization
known as oversight

243
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,544
should have such little foresight?

244
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,198
Meaning what?

245
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,716
They wanted to eliminate
Joseph Mars

246
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,969
along with the rest of P9,

247
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,388
which would have been
a terrible waste.

248
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,421
Nobody knew their way
around the human brain

249
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:24,890
better than he did.

250
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,376
Percy ordered me
to extract Mars.

251
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,689
But he didn't want anybody to know.

252
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,815
That's why everyone else had to die.

253
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,330
Mars knew that stimulating
certain parts of the brain

254
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,665
would improve focus, the senses.

255
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,198
So Percy had him create something

256
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:51,450
to give division agents an edge.

257
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,297
The regimen.

258
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,300
- How low is your supply?
- It's getting low.

259
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,391
Want to warn us before you turn

260
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,759
into the Tasmanian devil again?

261
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,180
I find Mars,
I find my way off of it.

262
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,349
Before the attack
on the senator yesterday,

263
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,883
I didn't even know
if the guy was still alive.

264
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,135
Last time I saw him,

265
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,020
he was trying to take
his research with him.

266
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,772
But there was no time.

267
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,863
Looks like he made the time
to come back for it.

268
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,096
For two years,
Mars worked for me

269
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:22,648
under lock and key.

270
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:26,101
And then he just disappeared
into thin air.

271
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,454
You're telling me
you have no idea where he went,

272
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:31,106
- how he got out?
- No idea.

273
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,544
But I can tell you this.

274
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,798
When the next shooter makes
an attempt on the senator,

275
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,341
it'll look like a copycat...

276
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,052
Another lonely lunatic
gone off the rails.

277
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,785
By the way, I saved the data

278
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,554
for falling ash on the black box.

279
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:47,923
Assuming she's read the file,

280
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:51,104
I imagine Nikita will come
to the same conclusions.

281
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,399
What makes you think
there'll be another attack?

282
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,318
If at first
you don't succeed...

283
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:59,568
...Made a statement condemning
the act of violence.

284
00:12:59,636 --> 00:13:01,821
I am uninjured.

285
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,689
And I will not let the act

286
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,025
of a lone, troubled individual

287
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,579
derail my duties.

288
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:12,031
Dr. Mars,
have you dispatched another?

289
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:14,983
They're in place,
awaiting activation.

290
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:54,456
Read & unite is possible
because of you,

291
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:55,541
so thank you.

292
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,503
And grab a cocktail while you can.

293
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:08,721
You clean up nice.

294
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:12,874
First time I've seen you
look like a girl.

295
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,678
Owen, we need to work
on your compliment skills.

296
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,107
Keep an eye out
for people on cell phones.

297
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,382
I'm guessing that's how Mars
activates his sleeper.

298
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,528
I think I got him...

299
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,595
Thick black glasses, on his cell.

300
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,932
Heading towards the senator.

301
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,071
Feed the Siamese
fighting fish first.

302
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:17,291
Then...

303
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:19,875
Do you mind?

304
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,494
Ugh.

305
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,663
False alarm.

306
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,670
I put you guys
next to the senator's table

307
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:33,472
so you can rub elbows
with the bigwigs.

308
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,189
This is Alicia.

309
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:06,171
Purple dress...
She's headed toward the senator.

310
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,873
Hurry.

311
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,271
I got her.

312
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,722
Got her.

313
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,025
Down on the ground.

314
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:29,111
Down. Let's go.

315
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:48,751
So where'd you get a black box?

316
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,760
Come on, Nikita.
I'm not stupid.

317
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,273
The things you know
about P9 and the op,

318
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:55,692
all those details...

319
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,279
I was on the ground.
I don't know half that stuff.

320
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:01,231
Michael took Percy's
master drive

321
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:04,367
when he left division.

322
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:08,194
So you peeked inside it?

323
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,029
I thought you were
"miss destroy all boxes."

324
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,406
He convinced me that this one
we would use for good.

325
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,561
Oh.

326
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:16,663
So you and Michael can handle
all the dangerous secrets,

327
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,954
but I can't.

328
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,383
Am I wrong?
The last time I saw you--

329
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,001
- I was suffering
from regimen withdrawal

330
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:24,502
when I tried to upload
the box in London.

331
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,713
I wasn't in a sound state of mind.

332
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,676
I'm better now, Nikita.

333
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,384
You still need a cure.

334
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,512
Yeah, and once I get it,

335
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,983
I'm gonna hunt down the rest
of Percy's guardians,

336
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,902
and I'm gonna destroy
their black boxes.

337
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,686
And then I'm gonna finish Percy.

338
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,974
You think I can handle that, right?

339
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:47,610
- I won't stop you.
- You mean you won't try.

340
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:53,572
What...

341
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:57,952
Who are you?
What am I doing here?

342
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,123
We had to get you
away from the cops,

343
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,125
but you're safe here.

344
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,860
Oh, my God.

345
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:05,845
Is that me?

346
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:06,929
Oh.

347
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:08,713
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

348
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,633
Look, I know this is scary.
Nothing makes sense.

349
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:13,175
But you have to trust me.

350
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:14,520
The search continues.

351
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:16,773
Everyone in the tri-state area
with a badge and a gun

352
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,180
is looking for this girl.

353
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:19,809
They track her back here,
and I'm toast.

354
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,277
We are the only ones
who know she's innocent.

355
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:22,511
We have to help her.

356
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,697
There is no we, okay?

357
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:26,833
There is me, and there is you.

358
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,285
Now, get rid of her, or you
and your super-friends crew

359
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:31,152
gots to go.

360
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,573
Don't give me the goatee
of intimidation, okay?

361
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,025
I know you won't hurt me.

362
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:39,118
No, but I might.

363
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:44,200
Those are mine, man.

364
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,719
You're kind of small.

365
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,839
You'd dissolve quick.

366
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,059
Whatever.

367
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:54,425
Just remember,

368
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,895
you're on your own with this one.

369
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:56,879
Okay.

370
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:08,858
I was gonna kill him.

371
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:11,527
I mean, I-I don't even kill spiders

372
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:13,068
when I find them at home.

373
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:15,615
I believe you, Alicia.

374
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,782
Someone did this to you.

375
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,002
They trained you to kill
without giving you a choice.

376
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,371
But that's...

377
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,507
How?

378
00:19:24,574 --> 00:19:27,510
I don't remember anything.

379
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,212
What about him?

380
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,301
That's Dr. Francis
from the Vory clinic.

381
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,054
I, uh...

382
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:41,391
Went to rehab there...

383
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:44,644
Pain pills.

384
00:19:44,728 --> 00:19:48,698
Well, you got clean.
That's all that matters.

385
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:51,984
I tell myself the same thing
every day.

386
00:19:56,273 --> 00:19:59,409
I tried n.A.,
therapy.

387
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,991
Nothing worked.

388
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:03,379
Then one day I got this letter
from Vory.

389
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:05,788
They said they could change
the feedback loops in your brain

390
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,706
so you wouldn't crave a fix.

391
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,458
I figured I had nothing to lose.

392
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:11,752
What do you mean,
change the feedback loops?

393
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:14,290
I'd...I'd wear these headphones
and sensors

394
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:15,714
to monitor my brain waves.

395
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,729
Then I'd get kind of sleepy, and...

396
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,063
Next thing I knew, I was awake,

397
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:23,389
and that need...

398
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,849
You know that feeling?

399
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,603
- Yeah.
- It was gone.

400
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,777
Oh, my God.

401
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:39,031
You mean this whole time
it was Dr. Francis?

402
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:45,288
We got to raid the clinic
and grab him.

403
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:46,706
There are rehab patients
in there.

404
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,291
We need to find out how many

405
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:50,760
and what kind of security
Mars is using.

406
00:20:50,827 --> 00:20:52,879
Mars would recognize Owen.
He wouldn't recognize me.

407
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,714
Michael, my love.

408
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:56,832
Jag officer, yes.

409
00:20:56,884 --> 00:20:58,267
Junkie, no.

410
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,470
Hey, I've passed as worse.

411
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:02,855
Infiltration is our best chance
at getting recon.

412
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,340
I know.

413
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:07,226
That's why I'm going.

414
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:27,863
Excuse me.

415
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:29,582
I think I need help.

416
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,584
I'm in.

417
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:34,036
I have ten minutes
to fill out a questionnaire.

418
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:35,588
Do you see Mars?

419
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,223
No.

420
00:21:37,307 --> 00:21:39,924
No, they must do the treatments
in another wing or something.

421
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,727
I'll let you know what I find.

422
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:43,896
Okay.
Nikita, be careful.

423
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:49,986
You get how lucky you are?

424
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:52,811
You got out of division
with the woman you love.

425
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:56,859
That's what I used to want
for me and Emily.

426
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,411
Yeah, I know what happened
to Emily.

427
00:21:58,495 --> 00:21:59,579
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:06,735
You know,
when things like that happen,

429
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:09,572
you...

430
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:13,092
Feel like the sun should turn dark.

431
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:15,960
The earth should stop spinning.

432
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,421
But the world keeps going on
around you.

433
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:21,417
Yeah, and you wonder
if it's a place

434
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:24,220
worth living in.

435
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,089
You and Nikita...

436
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,476
Why are you still living this life?

437
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:34,780
If I had a chance
to do it over again,

438
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:37,617
I'd just take off
with Emily, you know.

439
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:40,859
I wouldn't wait
for the right moment...

440
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:45,374
'Cause that's when it happens...

441
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:48,210
The threat you don't see coming.

442
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,917
Oh.

443
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:56,252
Sorry.

444
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,794
Still a little woozy.

445
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,456
Have your partners left already?

446
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:02,725
They're not my partners.

447
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,043
Pizza?

448
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,928
Actually, yeah.

449
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,129
I'm starving.

450
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,814
Thanks.

451
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,319
I'm Alicia, by the way.

452
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:16,805
I guess you could say I was
out of it when I came in.

453
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:17,907
It's cool.

454
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:19,481
They filled me in on your sitch.

455
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:21,777
You care if I hang down here?

456
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:23,663
That bedroom's kind of depressing.

457
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:26,155
Not that...

458
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,249
- I'm sorry.
- No.

459
00:23:27,317 --> 00:23:28,501
- That came out wrong.
- You're right.

460
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:29,669
It is, um...

461
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:31,754
It is depressing.

462
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,247
Sit, please, uh, wherever.

463
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,461
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

464
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:44,016
You've got nice hardware.

465
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:46,185
Uh, thanks.

466
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:49,004
I, uh... yeah, made some upgrades,

467
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:51,346
tweaked the video card a little bit.

468
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:54,527
Did you get the m.C.R.
Above 6,000?

469
00:23:54,611 --> 00:23:56,393
7,000, actually.

470
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,448
What, were you, like, a gamer
in a past life or something?

471
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:01,517
I used to work I.T.
For a big company,

472
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:04,193
though I do know my way
around Azeroth.

473
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:07,196
You like the gig?

474
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,042
Yeah, the offices
were super high-tech.

475
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,409
Gear was top of the line.

476
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:15,247
Then one day I showed up
to a meeting so high,

477
00:24:15,332 --> 00:24:18,167
I passed out.

478
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:24,507
A couple weeks later,
I started treatment at Vory.

479
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,716
I thought I was finally taking
control of my life.

480
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:32,148
But now my life is basically over.

481
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:35,067
Listen...

482
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,519
Nikita and them...

483
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,435
They're gonna set things straight.

484
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:41,730
Okay?
That's, like, what they do.

485
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:44,326
Things are gonna work out.
I promise.

486
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:53,786
They sent you

487
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,994
with the "get out of jail free" card?

488
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,357
Lose a bet to Amanda or something?

489
00:24:58,425 --> 00:24:59,792
I want to know
what the hell you were thinking

490
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:01,333
going to that event
without telling anyone.

491
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,179
I knew Nikita would be there.

492
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:04,753
I didn't want to lose
another shot at her.

493
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,296
You mean that
in a literal sense?

494
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:08,551
Because I saw
the security-cam footage.

495
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:11,804
You had Nikita in your sites,
and you lost her...

496
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,506
Her and the shooter...

497
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,639
Oversight's only link to Mars.

498
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,643
Your approach was stubborn, stupid,

499
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:19,945
and tactically inept.

500
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,529
And you came all the way
over here to tell me that.

501
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,709
You must have a lot
of free time on your hands.

502
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,451
Like I said,

503
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:38,537
I saw the security-cam footage.

504
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,584
You saved the senator's life.
I came to bring you home.

505
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:55,124
Michael, I think I got him.

506
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:57,860
Excuse me.

507
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:58,878
Um...

508
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:00,160
What are you doing?

509
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:03,132
I'm sorry.
I'm totally turned around.

510
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,167
Um, the receptionist told me
that the...

511
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:06,886
The interview rooms were back here?

512
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,170
You came in for treatment?

513
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,556
Yeah, my, um, friend...

514
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,975
She told me that you got her
clean in, like, a month,

515
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,476
so I thought that was awesome.

516
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,969
Yes, that's one word for it.

517
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,638
Yeah, okay, well, I guess
I'll just see you outside, then.

518
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,224
Actually, you can answer
some questions right here.

519
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,855
You see, the interview rooms
are all up in the front,

520
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:27,854
and Lucy wouldn't have sent you
in back.

521
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,658
So the first thing
that I want to know is,

522
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,728
why are you really here?

523
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:43,929
Who are you working with?

524
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,699
I told you.
I'm here alone.

525
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,625
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

526
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:50,419
We have no idea where she is

527
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,504
or how many guys
we'd be dealing with.

528
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,074
We'd be going in blind.

529
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,509
Okay, maybe we don't have to.

530
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,128
- Oh, wait for it.
- Yeah.

531
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:01,630
Yeah!

532
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:04,950
- Oh, it's funny every time.
- It's so funny.

533
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,138
It's them.

534
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:10,589
Maybe they got something for you.

535
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,606
Yo.

536
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:12,791
Birkhoff...

537
00:28:12,842 --> 00:28:14,234
I need you to hack into Vory...

538
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,794
Phones, security cameras, the works.

539
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm sorry. Did you just say
you need me to...

540
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:22,367
Mars grabbed Nikita.

541
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,161
Give me two minutes.

542
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,971
What's going on?

543
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:27,906
Everything's cool.

544
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,809
I just got to save their asses...

545
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,337
Again.

546
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,263
Oh, wow.

547
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:45,140
I bet you could give Shadow Walker

548
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,160
a run for his money.

549
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,020
Did you just say
"Shadow Walker"?

550
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,514
Yeah, he's done, like,
the most ingenious hacks

551
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,665
of the last decade.

552
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:55,333
What, you've never heard of him?

553
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,443
No, I...

554
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,104
I know him.

555
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:01,106
Dude's a legend.

556
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:04,951
You know, most of his targets
are, uh, shady wall street guys.

557
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:08,030
- I didn't know that.
- Yep.

558
00:29:08,098 --> 00:29:11,416
He's kind of Robin hood.

559
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:14,369
Where the hell
did you lift that from?

560
00:29:14,437 --> 00:29:16,021
You always assume
the worst in me.

561
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:17,790
Look, all I know
is that gear cost 10k.

562
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,958
The last time I checked,
you were unemployed.

563
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:21,960
Yeah, well, a lot of people
are willing to pay

564
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:24,413
- for my skill set.
- Yeah? Like who?

565
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:27,349
Okay, looks like
your best point of entry

566
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:29,418
is gonna be the southeast corner.

567
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:34,590
Think we can kick it in?

568
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:36,374
- On my count.
- Yeah.

569
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:39,736
One, two, three.

570
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,032
Go check it out.

571
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,290
So, if you're here
because of P9,

572
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:54,251
that means there's only one
person who could've sent you...

573
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,502
Percy.

574
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,754
I don't know
what you're talking about.

575
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,881
Please. I worked for the man
for six years.

576
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,842
I know division personnel.

577
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,510
You all have that same look.

578
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,387
There are people
that will wonder where I am,

579
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,680
and they will come looking for me.

580
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,973
Oh, I'm sure they will.

581
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,808
That's why these Venezuelan
gentlemen are here.

582
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,269
There were quite a few Venezuelans

583
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,895
in the original P9 program...

584
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:15,856
Before the government incinerated it.

585
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,941
They're ready for retribution.

586
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,609
And so am I.

587
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:25,490
That's the hallway
to Dr. Francis office.

588
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:27,951
Okay, you guys are gonna want
to stay to the right.

589
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,954
On second thought, maybe not.

590
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,699
Talk to me, Birkhoff.

591
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:36,126
Three of them...
Armed, dead ahead.

592
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,775
Go see what's happening.

593
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,238
I think they're out.

594
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:08,850
Judging by the sound of it.

595
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:11,497
Hands up!

596
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,668
You think you're so righteous,
don't you, huh?

597
00:31:26,753 --> 00:31:28,337
I know what it's like
to want revenge,

598
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:31,181
but I would never hurt
innocent people to do it.

599
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:42,359
You.

600
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,902
I want everything
on the regimen...

601
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,072
Every formula,
every piece of research,

602
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,032
all of it.

603
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:58,750
Here you go.

604
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:04,506
Turn it off.
Hey!

605
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,907
Turn it off!

606
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:11,596
Man, are you seeing this?

607
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:14,391
Alicia?

608
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,596
- What's happening to them?
- They've been triggered.

609
00:32:30,663 --> 00:32:32,284
But I don't think they've got orders.

610
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,375
Get down, get down, get down!

611
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,395
- You okay?
- Yeah.

612
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,863
Yeah?

613
00:32:47,948 --> 00:32:49,676
- Birkhoff.
- It's Alicia.

614
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,233
She heard the tones at the clinic

615
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:52,095
and got all zombified.

616
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,930
She grabbed a gun and took off.

617
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:56,057
I'm tailing her now, but I'm not
sure where's she's headed.

618
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,268
She's back
on her original mission.

619
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,459
God, I'm so stupid!

620
00:32:59,543 --> 00:33:01,771
I should've remembered the tones.

621
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:04,464
She doesn't deserve to go out
like this, Mike.

622
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,572
You didn't get what you needed.

623
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,574
I still got hope.

624
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,618
Those files got to be somewhere.

625
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,109
Alicia's been re-triggered.

626
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:18,788
Two guesses where she's headed.

627
00:33:18,954 --> 00:33:21,374
St. Joseph's hospital, where
the senator is recuperating.

628
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,501
Michael, he'll be crawling
with security.

629
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:24,753
She'll get herself killed.

630
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,602
Or Birkhoff...
He's right behind her.

631
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:28,287
You guys go.
I'll stay here.

632
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:30,623
I know a little something
about cleaning up crime scenes.

633
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:32,260
I'll tee everything up for the cops...

634
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:33,543
That Mars is the bad guy.

635
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,944
I'll get everybody
the help they need.

636
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:37,223
Might want to erase
the Venezuelans as well.

637
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:39,298
No need to create
an international incident.

638
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:41,801
Well, that goes without saying.

639
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:46,973
I can't figure out
why the Venezuelans

640
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:48,341
would target a junior senator
from Connecticut.

641
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:51,644
Even if their motive
was straight revenge...

642
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:53,073
Hang on.
Where are you?

643
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,897
I was about to ask you
the same question.

644
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,951
Somewhere in back-ass
country Greenwich.

645
00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:58,401
Probably gonna lose my signal.

646
00:33:58,468 --> 00:34:00,121
Michael, isn't St. Joe's
in Stamford?

647
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:01,971
- Yeah.
- Birkhoff, tell me exactly

648
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:02,958
where you are.

649
00:34:04,024 --> 00:34:06,586
Birkhoff.

650
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:10,446
Alicia's not headed for the hospital.

651
00:34:10,497 --> 00:34:12,717
What if the Venezuelans
were targeting someone else?

652
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:14,750
- At the dinner?
- And the picnic.

653
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:15,985
It was the same charity.

654
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:18,204
They have to have the same guests.

655
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:26,106
Judge Kathy Bridges sits on the board

656
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,607
of read & unite.

657
00:34:27,773 --> 00:34:30,299
Rumor is she's about to rule
against an oil company

658
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,028
for price fixing.

659
00:34:32,194 --> 00:34:34,489
A Venezuelan oil company?

660
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,991
Venezuelan, baby...

661
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,007
Petroleos orinoco.

662
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:40,726
And I bet the judge has
a nice place in Greenwich.

663
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,193
Alicia!

664
00:34:57,244 --> 00:34:59,222
Alicia!
Wait, stop!

665
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,475
You don't know what you're doing.

666
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:04,602
Listen, I know.

667
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:06,813
I know what it's like to get orders

668
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,471
that feel so strong,

669
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:10,692
you think you're gonna die
if you don't follow them.

670
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,820
But deep down...

671
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:18,147
There is a part of you that knows...

672
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:21,067
This isn't you.

673
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:24,456
And that part of you
can choose to stop.

674
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,360
Oh, no.

675
00:35:52,716 --> 00:35:54,194
You guys took your sweet time.

676
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,752
Birkhoff,
if you want to be conscious

677
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:59,588
for the car ride home, shut up.

678
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,544
Hey, computer guy.

679
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,588
It's Birkhoff...

680
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,216
Seymour Birkhoff.

681
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,844
Right, Seymour Birkhoff.

682
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,055
Nikita says you know where
the other black boxes are.

683
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,180
That true?

684
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:24,349
I know where they were

685
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,600
before Percy scattered
the last three guardians

686
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,685
to the wind...

687
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:30,187
Johannesburg, Tokyo, and Rio.

688
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,398
Is that where
you're going next?

689
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:35,425
Land of the lambada, crystal waters,

690
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:37,027
white sands...

691
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,196
Sounds nice.

692
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,532
First things first.

693
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,326
This is everything on the regimen.

694
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,819
I pulled it off Mars' computer.

695
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:48,455
It includes a way
to chemically detox.

696
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,793
It's, uh...It's the answers
I've been looking for.

697
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,744
You know it could take a while

698
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,713
for all that to get out
of your system.

699
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,382
Maybe you could stay here.

700
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,551
Absolutely not.

701
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,836
Yeah, it's, uh,

702
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,556
probably better I get clean
on the road.

703
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,140
The longer I wait,

704
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:09,018
the colder those guardian trails
get, you know.

705
00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:14,481
Good luck.

706
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:16,025
Yeah.

707
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,956
Owen...

708
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,958
If you ever need anything...

709
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,502
I'll be around.

710
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,319
Okay?

711
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:38,089
Okay.

712
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,488
I know why you lost Nikita
at the dinner.

713
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,758
You didn't blow your shot.
You were never gonna take it.

714
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,837
Tell me I'm wrong.

715
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,864
What difference
does it make to you?

716
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:22,759
As long as I am committed
to the mission...

717
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,302
I just want to give you
some advice.

718
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,869
Look, I don't need a lecture
on when to...

719
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,054
Will you shut up for a second?

720
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,057
When I was a Navy seal,

721
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:33,143
if you knew that your comrade
faced certain death,

722
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,647
you were supposed to take
his life first.

723
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,347
So one day I'm in combat,

724
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,400
and my partner gets grabbed.

725
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,685
And I had a gun,
but I couldn't pull the trigger.

726
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:43,103
I froze.

727
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,222
And I later found out
that he was tortured for months

728
00:38:45,273 --> 00:38:46,440
and then slaughtered.

729
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,908
And I could've prevented it.

730
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,861
He was your partner.

731
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,373
No matter what the situation was,

732
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,866
you didn't want to play a part
in his death.

733
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,253
He suffered because I was weak.

734
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,238
Do yourself a favor.

735
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:04,467
Next time you have Nikita
in your sites, take the shot,

736
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,593
because once she falls
into oversight's custody,

737
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,846
she will not be afforded any mercy...

738
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:11,182
By anyone.

739
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,605
The doctors
are deprogramming me.

740
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,816
The only side effect is

741
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,776
my memory's gone a little weird.

742
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,361
I can barely remember
the last couple months...

743
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,763
Every place I've been,
everyone I met.

744
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:29,909
I can't remember anything.

745
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,706
What is this?

746
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,667
That is Shadowbot.

747
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,794
Runs a 24-hour news feed

748
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,046
against every piece of data
in the black box.

749
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:44,799
Any story correlates
with an old division mission,

750
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,093
that bad boy pieces it
together for us.

751
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,886
Us?

752
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,805
That means
you're not kicking us out now?

753
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:59,981
You were right
about P9 being back.

754
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,850
You saved all those people.

755
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:05,635
We did...All of us.

756
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:07,363
And I know what it took.

757
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,516
I trust the equipment
we provided you with

758
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,851
proved satisfactory?

759
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,770
Guns worked fine.

760
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,189
You were able to get
the information you required?

761
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,525
I have what I need
to come off the regimen...

762
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,310
No side effects.

763
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,363
I'm glad to hear that.
Health is everything.

764
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,659
Tell me, is Nikita in good health?

765
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:55,995
I don't know
what you're talking about.

766
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:58,498
Please, Mr. Elliott.
We're all friends now.

767
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,792
This is a business arrangement.

768
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,243
Well, our arrangement concerns
the black boxes.

769
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:05,338
We heard a rumor that Nikita has one.

770
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,964
Can you verify that?

771
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,865
She doesn't.

772
00:41:11,586 --> 00:41:13,388
And if you do anything against her,

773
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,641
I'll kill you myself.

774
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,852
I like you, Mr. Elliott.

775
00:41:20,018 --> 00:41:21,345
You're very direct.

776
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,981
Allow me to be direct in return.

777
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:26,984
Gogol will fund your search
for the remaining guardians.

778
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:29,236
You will destroy their boxes,
and then...

779
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,780
Percy will die.

780
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,722
And you're gonna help make it happen.

781
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:34,274
But anything outside
those parameters

782
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,868
is out of my control.

783
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:37,495
As you said,

784
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,747
this is a business arrangement.

785
