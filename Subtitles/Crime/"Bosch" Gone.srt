1
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,583
I'll make it up to you.

2
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,051
I've got a hook up with a guy

3
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,953
who'll get us a table at Mozza.

4
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,356
I'll call you tonight, baby.

5
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,628
Please, baby. I know a guy.

6
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,962
Remember to get us a gas card,

7
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,198
or you too busy making plans

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,865
to get your ashes
hauled when you get back?

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,534
See, Harry, if you wasn't
such a fuckin' monk,

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,069
you'd know what it's like out there.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,406
It takes a lot of maintenance.
Yes, I got the gas card.

12
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,974
Then let's get goin' or we're
crossin' the desert at high noon.

13
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:46,113
Hold up. Bosch.

14
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:47,780
When?

15
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,816
Send him back.

16
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,585
- Nash.
- Wants to tell us he solved the case?

17
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:53,586
Hm.

18
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,358
Carl.

19
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,659
Wish you'd called.

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,528
Gettin' ready to hit the road for Vegas.

21
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,130
- Picking up your guy?
- The extradition hearing's

22
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,331
first thing tomorrow morning.

23
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:05,798
Yeah, that's sort of why I came in

24
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,834
- if you've got a minute.
- A minute, sure.

25
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:08,835
Yeah. Someplace private?

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,775
Grab a seat.

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,644
Yeah, the other day...

28
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:22,849
when you were asking
me about Tony Allen...

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,851
Yeah.

30
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,887
What's on your mind?
What'd you leave out?

31
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:31,691
Okay. About six months
ago I'm doing my rounds.

32
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,161
It's a nice evening, windows down,

33
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,196
I roll past the Allen's house,

34
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,764
I hear voices.

35
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,033
An argument. Two men, sounds
like it could get out of hand.

36
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,669
So you thought you'd check it out.

37
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,539
Yeah. So I park. I walk down
the side of the Allen's house,

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,475
Allen and this other guy are in...

39
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:51,944
looks like a home office, goin' at it.

40
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,045
What about? Could you tell?

41
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,747
Money.

42
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,916
The other guy's like,
"Where's my money, Tone?"

43
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,218
over and over, and Allen's like,

44
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,019
"Oh, I wouldn't do that to ya, I swear."

45
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,721
Other guy, he sign in at the gate?

46
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:06,092
I checked the log. There were no
visitors for the Allens that night.

47
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,694
So he must have come in with Tony.

48
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:10,797
So why are you tellin' me this now?

49
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,999
You said there'd been
an arrest in Vegas.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,003
I was... started thinkin', yeah,
we talked about made guys, mob guys.

51
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,740
I just remembered this guy
Allen had the fight with.

52
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,975
I mean, he had that
vibe, the, you know...

53
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,278
- Vegas wise guy.
- Absolutely, definitely.

54
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,846
Mobster all the way.

55
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,719
Think you could pick
him out of a six pack?

56
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,915
Yeah, I think I could.

57
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:32,917
Follow me.

58
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,222
Nah. It's none of these guys.

59
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,597
- You sure?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:43,021
That's the guy. That's the guy!

61
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:44,062
You sure about that?

62
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:45,994
No doubt.

63
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,700
Okay, we'll check it out.

64
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,336
- Really appreciate it, Carl.
- Thanks.

65
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,604
Am I... Am I right? He's a made guy?

66
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,874
We talk to him, we'll
ask him about that.

67
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,745
Okay. I... I should shove off.

68
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,248
- Uh, good luck in Vegas.
- Thanks.

69
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:02,449
- Yeah.
- Thanks for coming in.

70
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,684
Yeah, safe travel.

71
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,860
Joey Marks.

72
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,398
We got time for this?

73
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,066
Check In's not 'til 3:00.

74
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,067
Is it worth it? We got Rykoff.

75
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,336
On a platter.

76
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:32,204
Your Christmas pig. Courtesy of the FBI.

77
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,641
Feds got it all worked out.

78
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,008
Rykoff will give them Marks,

79
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,977
and Marks will give them
something on the Russians.

80
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,347
And that will give them something
on their counter terrorism thing.

81
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:43,049
- Exactly.
- Still want to find this Layla,

82
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,917
ask her what she knows.

83
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,653
Yeah, this is all residential.

84
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:49,422
Yeah, and Tony wrote it off
on his taxes as an office.

85
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,624
I dig this. What is this?

86
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,360
Sonny Rollins and Miles Davis

87
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,861
on Miles' album "Bag's Groove."

88
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,263
Sweet. What's it called?

89
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,832
"Doxy." Sonny wrote it.

90
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,901
- You know a lot about this stuff.
- A little.

91
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,670
Ever listen to anything
written in this century?

92
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,438
Still catching up on the last one.

93
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,906
Pull over, this is it.

94
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,657
Some office.

95
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,234
This is the life, huh, Harry.

96
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,704
Where did we go wrong? I mean,
we could be out here poolside

97
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,105
hangin' with these fine ladies.

98
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,774
You sure you guys don't need a warrant?

99
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,275
We're checking on her well-being, sir.

100
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,644
She was romantically involved

101
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,012
with a man who was murdered recently.

102
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,114
Murdered? That's awful.

103
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,416
Just making sure she's okay.

104
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,785
Of course. Hope to God she's all right.

105
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,021
Last time you saw here?

106
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,457
Ten days, two weeks.
Something like that.

107
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,591
How'd she pay the rent?

108
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,460
Direct deposit, first of the month.

109
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,094
I wouldn't be expecting
a deposit next month.

110
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,063
Yeah, it doesn't look
like she's comin' back.

111
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,433
Did she fill out an
application before she moved in?

112
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,834
Credit check, rental history.

113
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,068
We're gonna want to take a look at that.

114
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,437
I have it in the office.

115
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,440
We'll stop on the way out. Thanks.

116
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:18,445
When are we gonna interview
the girls at the pool, Harry?

117
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:20,147
Left dirty dishes.

118
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,316
Cell phone.

119
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,086
No wonder we couldn't
locate it. She killed it.

120
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,087
Smart.

121
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,594
What are those?

122
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,897
They're in Armenian. Religious, maybe.

123
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:42,669
Little girl, Layla? Grandma, maybe?

124
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,939
That's not L.A. for sure.
That's the old country.

125
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,691
Remember me?

126
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,497
Ah, you're one of the
assholes who busted Lucky.

127
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,098
We're looking for Layla.

128
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,800
- Knock on her door?
- Cut the shit.

129
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,835
- You know she's gone.
- Where'd she go?

130
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:16,969
No idea.

131
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,705
Soon as she heard Tony was dead,

132
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:19,972
- outta here.
- You see her go?

133
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,642
- Nope.
- So how'd you know?

134
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,076
Her car was gone. Poof.

135
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,879
Where would she go from here?

136
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,247
Now that her guardian angel's gone,

137
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,281
who the fuck knows.

138
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,517
Why would you call him that?

139
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,519
She worked in this
shit hole in North Vegas

140
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,021
with some other foreign girls.

141
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,524
Not a nice place. Tony
pulled her out of there.

142
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,891
A brothel.

143
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,794
I'd call it a cat house, but hey.

144
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,297
Yeah, still waiting on details.

145
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,867
- What time?
- Uh, tonight.

146
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,602
They said they'd let me know.

147
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,704
And this woman, Mo.

148
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,641
Yeah, I've been workin' on that.

149
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,142
Matched her face to a name.

150
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,545
Maureen O'Grady.

151
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,847
Vice cop. Mission Division.

152
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,815
Good work.

153
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,783
Yeah, well, it's a start.

154
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,553
We'll see who shows up
to the party tonight.

155
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,654
When do you see Lyle next?

156
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,456
Day after tomorrow.

157
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,291
You doin' okay with all of this?

158
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,661
No, I'm good.

159
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,767
I, um... I know it's been hard for you.

160
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,034
To make your own way in the department,

161
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:26,806
find yourself, get out
from under my shadow.

162
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,041
Uh, well, you know, I think I've got

163
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,310
a really good shot of
doing that with this gig.

164
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,280
You know, if I could just
get to the head of that snake.

165
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,849
I'm confident you will.

166
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,153
Well, thanks.

167
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,097
This look like a North
Vegas shit hole to you?

168
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,332
Yeah, the previous
address on her rental App.

169
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,835
Bet there's no pool.

170
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,682
Everybody sit tight.

171
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,718
We're looking for this girl, Layla.

172
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,220
She used to work here, live here?

173
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,521
_

174
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,724
Anybody know where she
is? We need to talk to her.

175
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,575
_

176
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,068
_

177
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,130
You work for Joey
Marks. This is his place.

178
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,165
This is my place.

179
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,101
Hey, get the fuck outta here. Go. Now.

180
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,937
Look, you want to tell me fairytales,

181
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,072
I got nothin' better to do.
We can stay here all day,

182
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,540
and you can explain to Joey Marks

183
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,876
where all his business went.

184
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,813
The girl you look for, Layla,

185
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,849
she not been here a long time.

186
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,483
- Couple years.
- Where'd she go?

187
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,118
She's dancer. Probably strip club.

188
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,487
- Dolly's?
- She meet customer.

189
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,682
_

190
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:52,581
_

191
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:53,603
_

192
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,503
_

193
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,028
Customer?

194
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,064
Customer fall in love with Lilliat.

195
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,099
Lilliat? Is that her real name?

196
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,168
Lilliat Saroyan.

197
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,972
Lilliat Saroyan. You know where she is?

198
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:09,042
I do not know. Please, leave now.

199
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,268
_

200
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:12,496
_

201
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,482
That was fucking depressing.

202
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,217
What do you think, they traffic?

203
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,986
Someone should talk to those women,

204
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,420
find out if they're free to leave,

205
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,355
and who's got their passports.

206
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,857
Joey Marks?

207
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,625
It's his place, I'll
reach out to Felton,

208
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,695
let them handle it.

209
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:29,962
How do people live out here?

210
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,731
It's a fuckin' desert.

211
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,132
L.A.'s a desert.

212
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,467
- With an ocean.
- It's still a desert.

213
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,803
I thought you loved L.A.

214
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:40,172
I do, but I know what it is.

215
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,443
Hmm.

216
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,246
Hey, how about some new shades?

217
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,580
Ray Bans?

218
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,416
Retro girl. Take after your dad.

219
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,552
I hope so.

220
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,654
Look, there's Monocle Optical.

221
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,556
Let's take the stairs.

222
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,158
It's on the third floor.

223
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,525
We can use the exercise.

224
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,094
I get lots of exercise.

225
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,364
Yeah, your thumbs look really
strong from all that texting.

226
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,665
Ha, ha. Very funny.

227
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,270
- Thumb war?
- No way.

228
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,350
Hey.

229
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,857
Oh.

230
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,526
Anything else?

231
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,329
Oh, I got my Krispy
Kremes, coffee, good to go.

232
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,599
- Have a good day, officer.
- All right.

233
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,369
Asshole.

234
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,468
Hey, you've reached George.

235
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,570
Leave a message. Call you back.

236
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,509
Hey, uh, call me when you
get a chance, will you?

237
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,980
Your mother wants to know what
your plans are for tonight.

238
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,388
Did you happen to check
out your groovy little case?

239
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,657
I know. It has a little
cleaner in there, too.

240
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,026
Always important.

241
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,862
Do we want to get coffee?

242
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:16,996
- Yeah.
- On the way out?

243
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,898
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

244
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,067
Good.

245
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,325
Hey, I thought this new contract

246
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,760
was supposed to guarantee
us separate accommodations?

247
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,430
It does. Somebody fucked up.

248
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,298
Could be worse. Could be
bunking with Crate or Barrel.

249
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,400
Yeah.

250
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,402
Hey, Jerry, what color
is your toothbrush?

251
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,504
Blue. Why?

252
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,406
No reason.

253
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,044
Seeing the family tonight?

254
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,811
Yeah. Come with.

255
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,213
No, I thought I'd hit the Spearmint.

256
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,748
Hearing's at 9:00.

257
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:43,749
I'll be there.

258
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,357
Hey, honey.

259
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,491
Maddie?

260
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:56,028
- Daddy.
- Maddie, what's wrong?

261
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,663
Maddie, what's going on?

262
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,966
I'm supposed to... I'm
supposed to tell you

263
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,400
that Mom and I are both okay,

264
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,036
- and that...
- Maddie. Maddie!

265
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,837
Don't make this difficult.

266
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,706
- Who is this?
- Harry.

267
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,976
- What do you want?
- Don't call the police.

268
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:13,145
If you harm them, I will tear
your teeth out, you son of a bitch.

269
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,047
- And you...
- Harry, what's wrong?

270
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,316
What the fuck's going on?

271
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,350
Harry, what's going on?

272
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,885
Maddie and Eleanor have been kidnapped.

273
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,153
Who? Why?

274
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,721
I don't know. Marks.

275
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:23,889
Shit. We gotta call Vegas Metro.

276
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,424
No! No. No fuckin' police.

277
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,093
- They said no police.
- They always say that.

278
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,128
Look, until I know
what I'm dealing with,

279
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,997
I'm not taking any chances.

280
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,664
Fuck this.

281
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,566
This isn't our town. We don't
even know where to begin.

282
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,567
I do.

283
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,506
Where you going?

284
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,608
Eleanor's.

285
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,478
She's got an App. Tracks Maddie's phone.

286
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,150
Just don't kill us before we get there.

287
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,028
Clear upstairs. Laptop.

288
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,163
Kitchen.

289
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,606
Clear!

290
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,575
Harry, got it.

291
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,677
It's password protected.

292
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,712
Try AKQJ10.

293
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,319
Zero-1-1-0-0-1.

294
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,122
- Got it. What was that?
- Maddie's birthday.

295
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,192
Scroll up.

296
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,127
Right there. Open.

297
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:39,965
It's a home security system. Rewind.

298
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,567
Fast forward.

299
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:42,568
Play.

300
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,114
Oh. You motherfuckers,
I'm gonna kill you both.

301
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,230
The tracking App. The pin will
tell us where her phone's at.

302
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:15,801
They would have turned
it off after she called.

303
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,236
Shit.

304
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,639
History log can pinpoint
where she was when she called.

305
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,345
- There.
- Kyle Canyon Road off 157.

306
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,713
It's 20 miles from here at least.

307
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,781
It's getting dark.

308
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:56,142
Nice ride.

309
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,844
It's a loaner.

310
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:26,872
Jerry!

311
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,448
It's Maddie's phone.

312
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,665
There's a duffel back there.

313
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,439
Hmm.

314
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,074
Da-dosh.

315
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,343
What the fuck is this?

316
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,312
That? That's a can opener.

317
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,546
Saddle up, cowboy.

318
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:08,615
Uh-huh.

319
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,319
Yeah, where these from?

320
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,120
- What the fuck do you care?
- I want to know.

321
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,655
They're clean, all right?

322
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,057
There were used in a multitude
of felonies, but not by us.

323
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,293
Uh-huh.

324
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,594
Yeah, where we goin', anyway?

325
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,730
Drop house on Fig.
Pick up's once a week.

326
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,097
That's tomorrow.

327
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,100
And tonight is gonna be fatter
than a super gordo burrito.

328
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,636
You're crowd control, Junior.

329
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,239
Anybody comes near you, lay
that fire down. You feel me?

330
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,408
Yeah, I feel ya, Mo.

331
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,843
I feel you.

332
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,618
- Bosch.
- Detective.

333
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,854
- Who is this?
- Doesn't matter.

334
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,658
You tell Marks anyone
lays a hand on my family,

335
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,894
a single scratch, and I'll kill you all.

336
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,330
Burn you to the fucking ground.

337
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,165
Keep your cool, detective,

338
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,734
and nothing will happen to anybody.

339
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,902
I'm listening.

340
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,704
Tomorrow morning after the hearing,

341
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,740
Rykoff will be in your custody.

342
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:12,344
You're going to deliver him to us.

343
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,812
And if I do that,

344
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:16,147
how are you gonna deliver
my family back to me?

345
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,250
Do exactly as we say.

346
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:23,221
There is a truck stop just
before the California border.

347
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,524
Off 15 in Primm.

348
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,593
Pull in for gas.

349
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,496
Thank the Nevada State
Patrol for their escort,

350
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,631
and send them on their way.

351
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:36,735
Tell your partner to
go inside for coffee.

352
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,472
While you fill the tank,
certain things will happen.

353
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,108
Rykoff will come with us.

354
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,744
The ladies will go free.

355
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,385
Good.

356
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,754
Marks wants to trade Rykoff
for Maddie and Eleanor.

357
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,489
He's afraid Rykoff's gonna flip.

358
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,525
Must be to pull this shit.

359
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,027
Rykoff must have something heavy.

360
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,094
We gotta call Vegas Metro.

361
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,730
No. No cops.

362
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,332
You don't want to call the
local, let's call the Feds.

363
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,033
Fuck the Feds.

364
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,336
This is my family.

365
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,602
Watch the street.

366
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:58,985
Oh, shit!

367
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,489
Down on the floor!

368
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,408
What? Let's hit it. Go!

369
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,242
Whoa. Go!

370
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:25,276
- Go, go, go.
- Go on. Go!

371
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,311
Shit!

372
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,084
Oh!

373
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,553
Go! Go!

374
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:35,855
Goddammit.

375
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,431
Marks.

376
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,968
His people kidnapped
my ex wife and daughter.

377
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,604
Now he says he won't hurt
them if I turn you over to him.

378
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:56,107
Bullshit, you wouldn't do that.

379
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,743
You got one play here.
You give me something,

380
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,511
anything that gets my family back,

381
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:03,115
or I swear to God, I'll hand you
over to Joey Marks in a heartbeat.

382
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,088
Who are these mutts?

383
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,126
Brothers.

384
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,995
Samoans, Tom, Jerry.

385
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,665
Call 'em that 'cause nobody can
pronounce their fuckin' names.

386
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:22,067
Where do I find them?

387
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,936
Safe house in the
desert. Tooley Springs.

388
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,905
Sometimes use it for shit like this.

389
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,174
You tell me how to get there.

390
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,895
- Hello.
- Lieutenant Lyle, Deputy Chief Irving.

391
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,097
- Chief.
- I'm tracking my son's phone.

392
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,499
Has he checked in with you yet?

393
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,966
He's following protocol, sir.

394
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,334
I left him a message earlier today,

395
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,603
he never got back to me.

396
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,337
No cause for concern, chief.

397
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,239
I expect to hear from him
first thing in the morning.

398
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,242
We're tracking him, too.

399
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,545
Thank you, Lieutenant.

400
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,231
I can't see shit.

401
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,669
They're in there.

402
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:15,006
On the couch, front room.

403
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,375
- Samoans?
- Yeah.

404
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,977
Watchin' TV.

405
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,412
One's strapped. The
other one I can't tell.

406
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,216
I got an idea.

407
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,893
Ah, what is this shit now?

408
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,832
Like that's gonna help.

409
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,735
I can't see through your stomach, bra.

410
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,470
Maybe it's the wind again.

411
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,106
Go check the dish.

412
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,677
And take your fuckin' gun.

413
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,705
Tom or Jerry?

414
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:21,506
- Tom.
- Who's in the house?

415
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,976
- My brother.
- Anyone else?

416
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:26,712
What's he carrying?

417
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:27,814
A .44.

418
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,953
You move, you die.

419
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:11,257
Get on the fucking floor nice and slow.

420
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:30,977
Clear!

421
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,579
We're okay. We're okay.

422
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,481
We're okay.

423
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,784
- Daddy.
- It's okay, baby, it's okay.

424
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:40,052
It's okay.

425
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,392
Whatcha doin', Harry?

426
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,095
I'm calling Felton, have
him come take out the trash.

427
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,963
Okay, wait. Before you do that,

428
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,664
- can I speak to you?
- Okay.

429
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,434
Okay, I'll be right
back. I'll be right back.

430
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,502
Okay?

431
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,405
- You got this, Jerry?
- I got this.

432
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,283
All right.

433
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:16,288
It's just... I just...
I can't stop shaking.

434
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,025
It's okay. It's okay.

435
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:22,828
Shh, shh. It's okay.

436
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,363
It's okay, it's okay.

437
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:27,834
I don't... I don't want
you to call the cops, okay?

438
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:32,370
Eleanor, you can't let these pigs walk

439
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,671
after what they did to
you and our daughter.

440
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,573
Our daughter cannot be a witness.

441
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,475
- Not against Joey Marks.
- We can protect her.

442
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,078
No. You're gonna have to
find another way, okay?

443
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,379
'Cause I'm not gonna testify,

444
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,282
and I'm not gonna let her testify.

445
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:49,287
Okay, but you and Maddie have to
get out of Vegas by tomorrow morning.

446
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,756
- And go where?
- L.A. My place.

447
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:53,125
Until this blows over.

448
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:58,530
Okay.

449
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,901
Okay.

450
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:03,768
Jerry.

451
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,470
Take Eleanor and Maddie to the car.

452
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,505
Gotta stop off at their
place and get some stuff

453
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:11,209
before we go back to the hotel.

454
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,311
Harry.

455
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,515
Go on. I won't be long.

456
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,977
You put a gun to my daughter's head.

457
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,495
Top lock sticks a little.

458
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:45,563
I'll figure it out.

459
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,165
Extradition hearing is this morning.

460
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,666
We're on the road by noon back to L.A.

461
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:49,700
I'm home by dinner.

462
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,769
Great. I hope nothing
happens before then.

463
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,771
Eleanor.

464
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:56,107
Nothing's gonna happen.

465
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:57,442
Billets is gonna send some cops

466
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,044
to pick you up at the airport,

467
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:00,445
and take you to my place.

468
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,680
They'll look in on you later.

469
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,583
Okay. Okay.

470
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,485
Dad, please come with us, Dad.

471
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,687
- Honey, I can't.
- No, Dad, please.

472
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,057
Honey, I can't.

473
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:14,559
There are some things I have to do.

474
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,327
I promise you,

475
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:20,065
none of those people will
ever bother you again.

476
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,666
Do you believe me?

477
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:22,867
Okay.

478
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:25,303
Now, look, your mother's very upset,

479
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,737
and she has every right to be,

480
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,141
but I would never knowingly
put you in harm's way.

481
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,810
I hope you know that.

482
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,480
I know that.

483
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,283
Just like I knew you'd come back for us.

484
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,193
I'll be home tonight.

485
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,530
We need to get through security.

486
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:56,634
Eleanor, there's a Glock
in the record cabinet,

487
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,969
and a 12 Gauge on the top
shelf in my bedroom closet.

488
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,439
I just want you to know where they are.

489
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,109
Okay?

490
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,211
Okay.

491
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:18,623
Detective Bosch.

492
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,458
I'm Dave Warren representing Mr. Rykoff.

493
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,026
Before we waive extradition...

494
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:23,928
What? You're not fighting it?

495
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,396
Well, what would be the point?

496
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,664
You got the murder weapon
and you tied it to my client.

497
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:27,965
How it got there and who put it there

498
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,867
is a matter for another day.

499
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:32,970
I need some assurances about the
security of his transport to L.A.

500
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,673
We'll drive straight through, no stops.

501
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:36,941
That's what I wanted to hear.

502
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:44,282
Docket 6-2-0-5, State
versus Lucas Rykoff.

503
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,551
Thank you, Tess.

504
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,220
This matter is an extradition hearing.

505
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,422
- Is the State ready?
- The State is ready, Judge.

506
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,158
David Warren representing the defendant.

507
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,659
Your Honor, if I may,

508
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,794
at this time the defendant
wishes to waive his right

509
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,464
to contest extradition to
the state of California.

510
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:02,534
So noted. Tess, what's next.

511
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:18,483
Be right with you.

512
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:19,484
Harry.

513
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,989
Yes, sir.

514
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,991
Uh, yes sir, this afternoon,

515
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,859
as soon as he's processed...

516
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,894
Hey.

517
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,496
Marks.

518
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,464
You ever come near my family again,

519
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,867
I'll cut your strings and
leave you drooling in a chair.

520
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,673
I don't suppose you're gonna tell me

521
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,275
what happened last night, huh?

522
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:45,911
You're right, I'm not. Let's go.

523
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,624
Bosch.

524
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,660
We ran that vehicle search
on Lilliat Saroyan, got a hit.

525
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,364
2012 Altima registered to this address.

526
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:07,932
Tony Allen's Vegas office.
You lookin' for the car?

527
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:10,401
We found it. Been in
our impound for a week.

528
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,002
She left it at the Greyhound station.

529
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,771
Shit. She could be anywhere.

530
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,140
Oh, we'll process it for
prints in case she surfaces.

531
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,443
- Thanks.
- All right, detective, remember our deal.

532
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:19,744
Partners on Rykoff.

533
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,479
He starts giving up secrets on Marks,

534
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,713
I'm your first phone call.

535
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:23,948
Right.

536
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,916
Nevada trooper will give
you a courtesy escort

537
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,387
- to the state line.
- Appreciate it.

538
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,060
What are you so happy about?

539
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,595
Why shouldn't I be?

540
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,897
First degree murder
indictment doesn't worry you?

541
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,031
Man, I got an alibi.

542
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,500
We heard different.

543
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,735
I got no motive to kill Tony Allen.

544
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,937
Joey Marks told you to.
That was your motive.

545
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,073
My lawyer's gonna shred
that search warrant,

546
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:50,275
and he's gonna shred you, Bosch,

547
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,409
for planting that fucking gun.

548
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,478
That gun gets kicked, I'm home free.

549
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:56,013
If that happens, which
it won't, then what?

550
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:59,284
As far as Joey Marks is
concerned, you're dead,

551
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:01,686
wherever you are, the
streets or in the joint.

552
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:04,390
- Unless you cooperate.
- Fuck you.

553
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:24,575
Rykoff, Luke.

554
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,777
Extradition out of Vegas on a 1-87.

555
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:31,516
Kiko, I want him put on keep-away
status, 100 percent isolation.

556
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:33,117
All right, when the
sheriff's come to pick him up,

557
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,586
make sure they know to put
him in protective custody

558
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,323
on a John Doe lodging.

559
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,597
Harry.

560
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,366
Not now, Mank, I gotta get home.

561
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,868
Billets wants to see you immediately,

562
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,704
as soon as his feet
hit the premises, APB.

563
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,240
- Pretend you didn't see me.
- I can't do it, buddy.

564
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,909
Bring me the head of Hieronymus Bosch.

565
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,944
Her exact fuckin' words.

566
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:00,945
Ah, shit.

567
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,154
Lieutenant.

568
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:11,221
You were just gonna leave

569
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,890
without giving me a full report.

570
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,425
I need to get home. My
family's waiting for me.

571
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,560
How are they?

572
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,994
Well, they were pretty shaky

573
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,596
when I took them to the
airport this morning.

574
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:20,431
Well, I can understand.

575
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:23,668
I can also understand why certain
decisions were made in haste last night.

576
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,403
- I appreciate that.
- But...

577
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,137
- Okay.
- You need to talk to Eleanor.

578
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,139
Get her to file on these thugs.

579
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,508
Letting them walk is a mistake,

580
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:32,743
and I am compromised
because you told me about it.

581
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:33,944
She isn't gonna change her mind.

582
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,245
They belong in prison.

583
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,449
Look, no way Joey Marks is
gonna let those guys skate

584
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,750
after screwing this up.

585
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,554
They will get what is coming to them.

586
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:45,624
Do you really want the full report?

587
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,994
No, I do not.

588
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,262
I just hope this doesn't come
back to bite us all in the ass.

589
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,699
It won't.

590
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,467
Go be with your family.

591
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:57,769
Thanks, Grace.

592
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:07,413
- Dad. - Whoa, what are you
people doing in my house?

593
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:10,948
Hey, how you guys settling in?

594
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,050
- In the spare room.
- Good.

595
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,520
- Find the towels?
- Same place they always were.

596
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,321
Brought some food.

597
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,656
- What are we having?
- Mexican.

598
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:22,326
Poquito Mas. Best
Mexican take out in L.A.

599
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,430
And I got you a new phone.

600
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,665
Thanks, Dad.

601
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,066
Why don't you go set it up.

602
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,035
Your mom and I'll put food on the table.

603
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,036
Okay.

604
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:35,441
I'll grab some plates.

605
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,587
How's she doing?

606
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:50,821
I don't know.

607
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:54,459
She seems fine but it
could all be a front.

608
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,826
I got a friend in behavioral,

609
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,562
shrink they sent me to last year.

610
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,630
You want I should reach out,
see if she'll talk to her?

611
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:02,032
Oh, give it a couple of
days, see how she does.

612
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,668
How'd the extradition go?

613
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:06,871
Routine. Rykoff waived, we
brought him back, booked him.

614
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:09,239
Does that mean we can go home?

615
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,408
Not just yet.

616
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,279
Where'd you find this?

617
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,548
Back of the linen closet.

618
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,517
Our trip to Catalina.

619
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:23,153
Midwestern girl. You didn't
even believe flying fish existed.

620
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,155
I still don't.

621
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,093
I see you redid the kitchen.

622
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,094
Yep.

623
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:32,731
Looks good.

624
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,336
So fuckin' weird being back here.

625
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:40,971
Ain't it the truth.

626
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:43,073
He's runnin' out of the house
with his, like, mask askew

627
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,476
lookin' out of one eye,
runnin' into a wall.

628
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:47,578
His mask askew.

629
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,581
Robbie, you are so full of shit.

630
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:51,949
- Hey, you know last night.
- Yeah.

631
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,018
Did y'all fuckin'
bump somebody in there?

632
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:56,086
No, bro, just the ceiling.

633
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,354
Gets their attention.

634
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,123
Well, is sure as shit
got mine, I tell ya that.

635
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,959
All that fuckin' drywall
dusk up in my nose.

636
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,162
That shit is fuckin' carcinogenic.

637
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,533
Now, what's that?

638
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:09,934
It's your end.

639
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:14,872
Mm-hm. Thank you.

640
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:17,208
Uh-huh. Oh.

641
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:21,779
Cap.

642
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,248
- Cap.
- How's it goin'?

643
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:27,184
It's goin' fine, just fine.

644
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:28,619
How are you all doin'?

645
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,855
Can't complain.

646
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,591
Irving.

647
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,225
I'm told you did real good last night.

648
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,294
Yes, you should have seen him.

649
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,629
He took out this big beaner

650
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,565
like he was fuckin' Ronda Rousey.

651
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:42,299
Uh-huh. Yeah, thank you.

652
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,601
I, uh... I think.

653
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,570
- Mm.
- And, uh...

654
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:48,272
Thanks for the dinero.

655
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,474
De Nada.

656
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:52,577
There's good times ahead.

657
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:54,245
Good times.

658
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,917
You're the key that's gonna unlock

659
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,687
a lot of new doors for us.

660
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,258
Just glad to be a part of it.

661
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,995
Oh, no, sorry.

662
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,864
You're not a part of it yet.

663
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,199
I'm not?

664
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:23,240
There's one more thing
you gotta do first.

665
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,442
We have a little...

666
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:26,844
initiation ritual.

667
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:30,114
We like to call it the Iron Rodeo.

668
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,619
Rodeo? What you, uh...

669
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,020
What you mean, like
riding horses and shit?

670
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,254
Yeah, it's somethin' like that.

671
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:40,490
All right. Yeah, but
I don't ride horses.

672
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:44,029
You'll ride this one.

673
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,220
Come on, man. Down to your skivvies.

674
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:13,258
Anything you don't want covered
in oil for the next 20 years.

675
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:19,730
You guys all did this?

676
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:21,398
- For real?
- All of us.

677
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:22,399
Even O'Grady.

678
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,671
Now that I would have liked to see.

679
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:30,836
Get up there, you little bitch!

680
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:53,058
- Yeah!
- Whoo, whoo!

681
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:12,878
Ride that thing!

682
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,848
Woo!

683
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:30,627
Woooo!

684
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:32,397
Yeah! Yeah!

685
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:52,817
Fuck's this?

686
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,151
I think it's a wire.

687
00:45:54,152 --> 00:45:56,887
Shit.

688
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:58,555
Can you wipe it?

689
00:45:58,556 --> 00:45:59,623
Keep him busy.

690
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,259
You got it.

691
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:43,334
Yeah!
