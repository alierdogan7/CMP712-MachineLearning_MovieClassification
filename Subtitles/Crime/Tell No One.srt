00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,999
TELL NO ONE

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,718
You guys free next weekend?

3
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,438
I told you we'd wake her.

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,519
Let me hold her!

5
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,798
You want a cuddle with Alex?

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,034
Give her the pacifier.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,912
Non-peacefully, even?

8
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,675
The country, what a drag...

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,398
I think he's ready!

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,956
After 9 years of med school,
a kid's the last thing he needs!

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,074
Why not?

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,474
They annoying you?

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,994
You feed her exhaust fumes
all day long!

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,069
No worries, I know what she likes.

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,992
Wrap the blanket round her.

16
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,632
<i>Lake Charmaine</i>

17
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,954
François! François!

18
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,748
Daddy! Daddy!

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,035
Let's go.

20
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,635
Stop that!

21
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,676
Looks good.

22
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,235
- Did you call your sister back?
- No.

23
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,389
Why are you being like this with her?

24
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,589
Like what?

25
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,916
I don't know.

26
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,710
Last night, you totally ignored her.

27
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,917
- Because she won't sell the farm?
- It's crazy!

28
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,749
It costs us a fortune.
She doesn't even want to live there.

29
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,679
You think your dad
would've wanted to sell?

30
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,474
That's irrelevant.
She's a rider not a manager.

31
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,148
Who'll run the stables?
I don't have time.

32
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,112
- Don't get mad.
- I'm not.

33
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,151
You always take her side.

34
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,633
You're right. I'll butt out.

35
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,196
Margot, it's not that.
Look, I'm sorry.

36
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,719
I'll let the dog out.

37
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,639
I'm sorry!

38
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,995
Margot?

39
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,874
Alex!

40
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,029
<i>Eight years later</i>

41
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,035
Okay...

42
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,790
I think I've seen enough
to contradict your family doctor.

43
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,476
We'll take her off cortisone.
It won't cure her eczema.

44
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,113
What will help her...

45
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,799
is if you let your child
enjoy her life.

46
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,115
Get off me!

47
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,911
You know what I would suggest
when she doesn't have school?

48
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,348
Cartoons in bed,

49
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,552
fries for lunch.
Friends to visit

50
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,070
all afternoon, and Barbie,
chocolate and the whole shebang!

51
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,554
Call him, I said!

52
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,794
And lots of TV, of course.
Excuse me.

53
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,194
Let go of me!

54
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,556
Let go of me or I'll pop you!

55
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,713
- Call him!
- Calm down...

56
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,672
Get lost!
Who the hell are you?

57
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,869
Get lost, I said!

58
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,832
- Calm down.
- He hit me!

59
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,519
Bruno, what's wrong?

60
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,392
He fell off the couch!

61
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,999
I told them to call you!

62
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,679
I called ER first!

63
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,158
- He's your patient?
- For 3 years. Hemophiliac.

64
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,158
Bruno, give them your son.

65
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,794
- No, why isn't it you?
- It's not my unit.

66
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,149
Fuck that! I want you.

67
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,473
Nobody touches my boy!

68
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,671
Nobody touches my boy!

69
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,798
Okay, Bruno.

70
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,954
Your son probably
has internal bleeding.

71
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,278
Give him to me.
I'll take him in if you want.

72
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,196
Stand back!

73
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,554
What you staring at?

74
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,116
<i>Two bodies unearthed</i>
<i>in Rambouillet forest</i>

75
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,519
Shit, that's good!

76
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,318
Julie, show Mr. Rossignon to table 9.

77
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,878
- I love lunch with you.
- Sorry.

78
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,870
Summer's usually quiet
but we're overrun by tourists.

79
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,750
I'll have the sole
and turn the air-con up, it's sweltering.

80
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,633
You got plans tomorrow?

81
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,710
I promised Margot's mom I'd stop by.

82
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,672
Alex, don't you think it's...

83
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,995
It's been 8 years!

84
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,918
I'm not saying turn the page,

85
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,113
but I don't see why you always
celebrate this morbid anniversary.

86
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,036
Celebrate?

87
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,832
Whatever...

88
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,510
You've nothing to say to them.
You see them once a year

89
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,517
to commemorate her death.

90
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,399
I'm sorry...

91
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,389
It's just I thought
we'd spend the evening together.

92
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,508
I'll come by after.

93
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,516
If you shut me out,
you'll shut everyone out.

94
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,871
Talk to me, okay?

95
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,469
How you doing?

96
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,196
Going nuts,
sitting doing nothing.

97
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,949
I can imagine.

98
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,995
Unfortunately, it's the only option.

99
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,954
They'll call you
when the operation's over.

100
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,230
Now, you're here,
I'll take a walk.

101
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,949
Call me if there's news.

102
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,469
Sure.

103
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,711
Thanks.

104
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,477
What? Take it back.

105
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,318
You'd prefer a DVD player?

106
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,398
Plasma TV? A sweet plasma?

107
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,239
I don't want anything.
Take it back.

108
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,834
I'll call you.

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,240
<i>Click on the link.</i>

A problem?

114
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,630
Not at all. Show her in.

115
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,517
Rambouillet police called.
Sergeant Lavelle.

116
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,039
He said it was urgent.

117
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,592
What are you staring at?

118
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,798
I love watching you ride.

119
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,994
- Come more often then.
- Yeah, I should.

120
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,869
I'll be right there.

121
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,909
Excuse me.

122
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,391
Can you tell me when you went

123
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,431
to Lake Charmaine last?

124
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,557
I was down there last year.

125
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,996
Doctor?

126
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,755
8 years ago.

127
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,633
Like I told your brother on the phone,

128
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,836
workmen laying pipes
dug up 2 bodies near the lake.

129
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,951
She heard it on the radio.

130
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,397
Yes, the press caught us
with our guard down.

131
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,709
- You've identified them?
- No, we're running tests.

132
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,195
All we have is
2 Caucasian males

133
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,911
shot dead over 5 years ago.

134
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,999
You said the bodies weren't on our land.
So why speak to us?

135
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,397
I'm getting to that.
We may have to excavate farther,

136
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,399
so I'd need permission to...

137
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,669
You have it.

138
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,438
- Anne?
- Of course.

139
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,631
- You need a signature?
- Yes.

140
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,271
Both your signatures.

141
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,558
Sorry to drag this back up.
I know your wife's killer was tried...

142
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,433
Cut the crap!

143
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,028
You thought I killed her!

144
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,236
You were her husband.
Family members are often...

145
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,318
If not for that,
you might have found her alive!

146
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,838
My colleagues
had to examine every possibility.

147
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,116
Thank you.

148
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,753
I'll need one last thing.

149
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,476
What?

150
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,035
A blood sample for a DNA test.

151
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,473
When your wife was abducted,
you said they hit you...

152
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,715
Yes.

153
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,793
Well, we found a baseball bat
with the bodies,

154
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,352
with traces of blood on it.

155
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,115
B positive.
Just like you.

156
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,312
You are type B positive?

157
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,832
Of course, they could be victims
of Frank Serton,

158
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,958
except serial killers
rarely change their M.O.

159
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,355
Neither body shows signs of torture.

160
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,591
They'd been buried.
There were no animal corpses.

161
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,316
And Serton's victims were all women.

162
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,509
So?

163
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,316
So, it's all a bit fuzzy, Doctor.

164
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,230
Let's talk again when it's not.

165
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,629
That's precisely
why I need your cooperation.

166
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,674
I'll give the sample,
but I told you all I knew back then.

167
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,555
Yes, I read your statement.
Your wife screams...

168
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,436
You get hit, fall in the water.
Wake up in the hospital.

169
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,717
And the rest is still a blank.

170
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,873
We bought that version.

171
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,868
But if it is your blood,
the discovery of these 2 bodies

172
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,150
means we'll reopen the investigation.

173
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,038
I'll get it.

174
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,108
We'll try to get some answers
to all those questions,

175
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,313
like why were you found
unconscious on the dock?

176
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,390
Who made the anonymous 911 call?
And above all...

177
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,998
How did you get out of the water
when unconscious?

178
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,637
Ms. Vigne is a nurse.
She'll take your blood sample.

179
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,792
I thought you'd prefer...

180
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,552
to do it right here.

181
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,112
Céline, I'm not taking calls.

182
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,029
<i>Yes, Doctor.</i>

183
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,752
<i>Tomorrow, same time</i> + <i>2 hrs.</i>
<i>Message for you.</i>

184
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,155
<i>User name: Concert.</i>
<i>Password: Olympia.</i>

185
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,191
<i>TELL NO ONE. THEY'RE WATCHING.</i>

186
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,072
Are you seeing anyone?

187
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,151
I'm sorry, Alex.

188
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,631
You don't have to tell me,
it's none of my business.

189
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,639
There's no one.

190
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,311
I mean, nothing serious.

191
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,389
Alexandre...

192
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,357
We all miss her so much.

193
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,318
But you have a life to live.

194
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,159
Don't feel guilty
about seeing other people.

195
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,715
I don't.
I mean, it's not that.

196
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,278
I'll check the lamb.

197
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,949
How are you?

198
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,119
Good. And you?

199
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,629
Retirement!

200
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,191
I wake up every morning
and make like...

201
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,869
Drink?

202
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,555
Jacques?

203
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,230
I have an important question for you.

204
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,674
I want to know...

205
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,470
Margot...
What did she look like when you found her?

206
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,875
What?

207
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,032
I keep thinking about it.
Maybe it's the anniversary...

208
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,073
I need to know.

209
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,917
I never asked you for details.

210
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,953
Was she beaten?

211
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,719
Why are you doing this?

212
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,718
I really need to know.

213
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,072
There were bruises, yes.

214
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,955
Where?

215
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,233
On her face?

216
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,272
Yes.

217
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,349
- Her body, too?
- I didn't see her body.

218
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,628
I was there as her dad not a cop,
to ID her.

219
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,915
Did you identify her easily?

220
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,394
Easily?

221
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,471
You said her face was bruised.

222
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,352
Screw you and your questions!

223
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,199
If you could please identify the body?

224
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,638
<i>Her left eye was swollen.</i>

225
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,075
<i>Her nose was flattened and broken.</i>

226
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,120
<i>Her face was slashed,</i>
<i>probably with a box cutter.</i>

227
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,228
Her jaw was dislocated,
tendons ripped out...

228
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,712
I'd like you to leave.

229
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,309
Already?

230
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,991
- They kick you out?
- Yeah.

231
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,110
<i>European Championships 1996</i>

232
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,073
To conclude this tribute,
I'd like you to applaud

233
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,231
the President of the Children's Trust

234
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,557
organizer of tonight's show
in memory of his son,

235
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,316
he's going to lead the riders out.

236
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,875
Please give a warm welcome
to state senator...

237
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,873
Gilbert Neuville!

238
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,511
Four short strides. It's tight.

239
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,319
So at 8:15 tomorrow,
you get another message, right?

240
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,515
Right.

241
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,589
Where's that?

242
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,995
Don't know.
Not in France, it's still light.

243
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,792
How can you think it's her?
You can't see shit.

244
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,718
Don't go there, Alex.

245
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,717
It'll drive you insane.

246
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,910
I know.

247
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,708
How did it go?

248
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,433
I placed second!

249
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,710
- Bed for me. I'm wiped out.
- I was just leaving.

250
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,839
You want some food, sweets?

251
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,312
It's nothing. We had a fight.

252
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,595
She thinks I'm banging
one of the waitresses.

253
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,989
Lose that and get back to the emails.

254
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,712
You knew the 2 guys at the lake?

255
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,069
Show me the other.

256
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,675
Same sender?

257
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,598
Anonymous. Who knows?

258
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,358
I do. It's the same person.

259
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,713
You tried the passwords?

260
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,519
The account doesn't exist.

261
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,315
The sender will set it up at 8:15.

262
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,036
I'm hooked up to both his computers.

263
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,708
As soon as he's online, we'll know.

264
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,518
I think I know enough already.

265
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,789
Dr. Beck?

266
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,477
Detective Meynard,
Versailles police.

267
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,079
Can you follow me?

268
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,913
What's going on?

269
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,039
Excuse me a second.

270
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,195
- Where'd you go?
- Wash my hands.

271
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,115
Captain Eric Levkowich,
Versailles PD.

272
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,072
What's all this about?

273
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,438
It'll be easier to talk at the office.

274
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,109
Mr. Beck...

275
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,912
Who is Juliette Langlois?

276
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,270
Will you stop that?

277
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,431
Does the name Juliette Langlois
mean anything to you?

278
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,871
Juliette is my wife's middle name.

279
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,633
And your middle name?

280
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,756
Arnaud.

281
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,557
So let's imagine that I ask you
if the name...

282
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,311
Arnaud Ripper
means something to you.

283
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,953
You'd say,
"Actually, Arnaud's my middle name"?

284
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,871
My wife grew up on Rue Langlois.

285
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,114
That's why I said
it was her middle name.

286
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,879
It reminded me of her.

287
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,714
Did your wife ever use that name?

288
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,235
In what way?

289
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,399
"Hello, I'm Juliette Langlois,
I booked a room..."

290
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,154
Or to get an ID with that name, see?

291
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,353
No, it was a game we played
when we were kids.

292
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,269
Did you ever beat up your wife?

293
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,472
Let me repeat the question.

294
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,319
Did you ever beat up your wife?

295
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,748
What's wrong with you?

296
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,110
Slapping your wife's no crime.

297
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,793
Pretty natural even, huh?

298
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,718
No, it's not natural!

299
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,512
I never beat up my wife.
Are you listening to me?

300
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,358
You think I did that?

301
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,952
I promised your friend Hélène

302
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,472
I'd help you, but I need you
to tell me all you can, clear?

303
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,634
The car accident story...
Is it true?

304
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,314
Of course, it's true.

305
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,869
Were you with her?

306
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,469
I was doing my internship in Bordeaux.

307
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,352
- I'm warning you. They'll check.
- Let them.

308
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,479
I know what I'm saying.

309
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,150
Maybe she took the photos
for the insurance. Seems logical.

310
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,237
No idea. I never saw them before.

311
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,839
Are you forgetting anything?

312
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,708
No.
What happens now?

313
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,317
8 years on, it's a bit late
for a wife-beating charge. This stinks.

314
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,679
Okay, go for it.

315
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,949
Love it!

316
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,516
Now, let's get a little wild.

317
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,631
This is really good.

318
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,798
Hold the duck in front of you,
like it's your thingy.

319
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,634
Your tongue out
like you're gonna lick it.

320
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,909
That's great!

321
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,749
Fred!

322
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,949
And again! More tongue!

323
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,432
Love it!

324
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,789
Hold on...

325
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,993
I don't get it.

326
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,716
You came to ask me that?

327
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,756
That's all you have to say?

328
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,588
I'm sorry.

329
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,791
I don't give a shit about sorry!

330
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,319
That's not the problem.

331
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,439
I was grieving too, you know.

332
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,638
I needed you there.

333
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,548
You never called.
You never took my calls.

334
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,909
I couldn't.

335
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,430
I swear...
I couldn't face calling you.

336
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,031
I thought I'd pull through alone.

337
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,192
But I just went under.

338
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,349
Tell me what happened.

339
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,468
I don't know.

340
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,873
Weren't you with her?

341
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,317
One evening, she came by
covered in bruises all over.

342
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,429
She said she'd had a car accident.

343
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,031
If anybody asked, I was to say
we'd been together in my car.

344
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,470
If anybody asked?

345
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,199
I think she meant you.

346
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,709
She wouldn't tell me anything else.
Nothing, honestly.

347
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,751
- You took photos?
- Of?

348
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,598
Her. Her injuries.

349
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,673
Why would I do that?

350
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,709
No reason.

351
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,193
What's wrong?

352
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,674
I've no idea.

353
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,918
She was my best friend.

354
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,358
Look at me, please.

355
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,510
I swear she never lied to you.
It was the only time.

356
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,915
You gotta believe me.

357
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,473
<i>Ferrault & Gamblin...</i>

358
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,989
May I to speak to Mr. Ferrault, please?

359
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,109
<i>He's in court.</i>
<i>Can I take a message?</i>

360
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,237
We found no trace of an accident...

361
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,590
in either the insurance
or police records.

362
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,717
Alex never hit Margot.

363
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,795
He couldn't have.

364
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,673
Can you leave us alone?

365
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,468
Captain...

366
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,756
If your son-in-law
decided to kill your daughter...

367
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,875
He loved her, why'd he wanna do that?

368
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,796
For 200,000 euros.
Her life insurance policy.

369
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,314
That's absurd!

370
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,839
With all the holes in the official story,
compare it to this...

371
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,031
Beck drives her to an isolated locale
where there'll be no witnesses.

372
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,429
There,

373
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,589
the two guys we found last week
kidnap and kill her.

374
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,953
Serton's on the loose.
It's in all the papers.

375
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,955
They make it look like
she's one of Serton's victims.

376
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,476
With dead cats and dogs all round.

377
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,031
Easy as that. He takes the rap.

378
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,198
Serton confessed to 7 murders,
not your daughter's.

379
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,949
This is ridiculous.

380
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,789
Alex was assaulted.
He was in a coma for 3 days.

381
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,479
He had to get hurt.

382
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,554
How'd he explain a couple scratches?

383
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,752
He was on the shore.
How'd he get out of the water?

384
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,472
All the doctors who saw his file
say it's impossible.

385
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,679
Didn't that ever intrigue you?

386
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,514
Who gave you those?

387
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,479
In some way,
I'd say it was your daughter.

388
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,389
We found a key
on one of the 2 corpses.

389
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,950
To your daughter's safety-deposit box.

390
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,591
Box 174.

391
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,391
Registered to one
Juliette Langlois.

392
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,197
Her middle name
and this street name.

393
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,879
The photos were inside.

394
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,670
Your son-in-law said he never saw them.

395
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,117
Why would she hide them from him?

396
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,152
You talked to Alex?

397
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,437
- What else did he say?
- Nothing.

398
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,518
He left with a lawyer.

399
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,439
Not just any lawyer.
Elisabeth Feldman.

400
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,396
That sound like an innocent man?

401
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,992
Stop it now, that's enough.

402
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,316
It's impossible.
It's the cops,

403
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,556
trying to manipulate you.

404
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,674
They can do anything with computers.

405
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,199
She looked older.

406
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,029
Age progression software.
They use it for missing kids.

407
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,956
Mommy!

408
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,756
If they think I killed her,
why send me emails

409
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,439
as if she's still alive?

410
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,074
Think about it.

411
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,597
To get me to confess, it sucks.

412
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,311
If I killed her,
I know it's a trap.

413
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,590
- Alex, not now!
- It doesn't make sense.

414
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,112
If they wanna trap me, send me
emails from a guy who saw me kill her.

415
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,190
You see?

416
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,076
If daddy says yes,
we'll go this weekend.

417
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,513
C'mon, sweetheart,

418
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,158
it's time to sleep now
and don't give her a hard time.

419
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,918
Sleep well, princess.

420
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,829
Where's Margot?

421
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,272
I asked you a question.

422
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,439
Nina!

423
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,593
Go away! Basket!

424
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,715
Cut it out!

425
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,912
Fuck it!

426
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,469
Hold on, let me try.

427
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,477
I've been trying for half an hour!

428
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,959
It doesn't work.

429
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,069
Nothing works!

430
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,595
Fucking thing!

431
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,755
What's that up there?

432
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,074
What is it?

433
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,000
It means you're connected
to another computer.

434
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,469
And?

435
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,951
And I only have one computer here.

436
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,670
Someone's connected to my computer.

437
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,717
They're watching me.

438
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,989
Fuck it!

439
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,714
Okay...

440
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,596
The Basque.

441
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,356
The chick's bailed and Beck's out

442
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,879
walking his dog.

443
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,196
He'll keep in touch.

444
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,830
She told us all she knows.
Let's go.

445
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,989
Hit the lights.

446
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,715
You asshole!

447
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,275
C'mon, Nina!

448
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,918
You can't bring a dog in.

449
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,709
You were first.

450
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,194
Number 15.

451
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,958
<i>Hello U2.</i>
<i>You have 1 new message.</i>

452
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,878
<i>Parc Monceau, tomorrow, 5 p.m.</i>
<i>Near the bandstand.</i>

453
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,718
<i>Be careful. I love you.</i>

454
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,589
<i>Parc Monceau, tomorrow, 5 p.m.</i>

455
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,472
<i>Be careful. I love you.</i>

456
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,117
8 years ago, my wife, Margot Beck,
was brought here.

457
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,391
She was one of Serton's victims.

458
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,471
Frank Serton...
Yes?

459
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,996
Did you do the autopsy?

460
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,790
Yes.

461
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,036
Do you photograph the corpses?

462
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,789
Yes, we do.

463
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,390
So you photographed my wife's autopsy?

464
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,997
- Most likely.
- I'd like to see them.

465
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,592
I don't have them here.
The case is closed.

466
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,198
But I can see the report?

467
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,231
Sure, but not today.

468
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,319
You have to request to see it.
There are forms, a procedure.

469
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,431
Okay, I'm making the request.

470
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,315
Capt. Barthas, Crime Squad.

471
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,235
My partner's here with the witnesses.

472
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,875
In the kitchen.

473
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,910
He was the last person you saw?

474
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,309
Yes.

475
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,319
- What time was it?
- I don't know. Around 2 p.m.

476
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,479
She introduce you?

477
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,359
She tell you his name?

478
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,953
Alexandre Beck.

479
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,557
- We found this.
- Where?

480
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,429
A trash can downstairs.

481
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,710
He's going down.
It was a pleasure working with you.

482
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,279
Not now. No can do.

483
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,279
<i>I'll be right there!</i>

484
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,639
Barthas for Levkowich.

485
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,068
The beltway!

486
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,149
Round the other side!

487
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,074
Four, that way!
Vincent, go with them!

488
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,078
Hello, Bruno?

489
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,432
Not at all.
In fact, he got in early today.

490
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,596
Did he seem at all nervous?

491
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,519
Nobody mention anything?
