00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:21,124
HI: My name is H.I. McDunnough.

00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,625
[Door slams]

3
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:25,712
Call me Hi.

4
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:29,382
The first time I met Ed...

5
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:32,053
was in the county lockup
in Tempe, Arizona.

6
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:35,723
DEPUTY:
Don't forget his profile, Ed.

7
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:36,933
Turn to the right!

8
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:38,684
HI: The day I'll never forget.

9
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:41,520
Turn to the right!

10
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:44,441
What kind of name is Ed
for a pretty thing like you?

11
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,443
ED: Short for Edwina.
Turn to the right!

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,237
You're a flower, you are.

13
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:51,783
Just a little desert flower.

14
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:55,119
Let me know how those come out.

15
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:58,457
HI: Prison life
is very structured...

16
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:01,125
more than most people
care for...

17
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:04,004
but there's a spirit of
camaraderie between the men...

18
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,674
like you find
only in combat, maybe...

19
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:10,136
or on a pro ball club in
the heat of the pennant drive.

20
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:11,805
Grrrr!

21
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:13,807
HI: In an effort
to better ourselves...

22
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:15,725
we were forced to meet
with a counselor...

23
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:20,064
who tried to help us figure out
why we were the way we were.

24
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:23,192
SCHWARTZ: All he wanted
was a hot roll and butter.

25
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:24,903
So...

26
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:27,447
why do you use the word
"trapped"?

27
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:28,782
Huh?

28
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:33,245
Why do you say you feel trapped
in a man's body?

29
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,874
Well, sometimes I get
the menstrual cramps real hard.

30
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,044
MAN:
Have you learned anything, Hi?

31
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:41,629
HI: Yes, sir. You bet.

32
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,756
WOMAN: You wouldn't lie to us,
would you?

33
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:46,343
HI: No, ma'am. Hope to say.

34
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:47,636
MAN: OK, then.

35
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:51,015
HI: I tried to stand up
and fly straight...

36
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:54,477
but it wasn't easy with Reagan
in the White House.

37
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:57,689
I don't know.

38
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:01,277
They say
he's a decent man, so...

39
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,445
[Click]

40
00:02:02,486 --> 00:02:04,697
maybe his advisers are confused.

41
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:09,660
ED: Turn to the right.

42
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:13,040
What's the matter, Ed?

43
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,877
My "fy-ance" left me.

44
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,463
HI: She said her fiance
had run off...

45
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:20,089
with a student cosmetologist...

46
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:22,383
who knew how to ply
her feminine wiles.

47
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:25,053
The sumbitch.

48
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:26,931
DEPUTY:
Don't forget his phone call, Ed.

49
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:31,602
Tell him
I think he's a damn fool, Ed.

50
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:35,105
You tell him I said so--

51
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:36,983
H.I. McDunnough.

52
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:39,986
If he wants to discuss it,
he knows where to find me--

53
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:42,155
in the Maricopa County
Maximum Security...

54
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:43,740
Correctional Facility For Men...

55
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:46,327
State Farm Road Number
Thirty-one, Tempe, Arizona!

56
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:47,577
I'll be waitin'!

57
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:50,373
I'll be waitin'.

58
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:56,255
HI: I can't say I was happy
to be back inside...

59
00:02:56,296 --> 00:03:00,217
but the flood of familiar
sights, sounds, and faces...

60
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,637
almost made it feel
like a homecoming.

61
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,931
Most men your age are getting
married and raising a family.

62
00:03:05,973 --> 00:03:07,183
Well, factually--

63
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,269
SCHWARTZ: They wouldn't accept
prison as a substitute.

64
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,021
Would any of you men
care to comment?

65
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:13,941
GALE: Well...

66
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:16,735
sometimes your career
has got to come before family.

67
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:19,321
EVELLE:
Work's what's kept us happy.

68
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:23,159
HI: I tried to sort through
what Doc Schwartz had said...

69
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,204
but prison ain't
the easiest place to think.

70
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:29,500
CELLMATE: When there was
no meat, we ate fowl.

71
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,545
When there was no fowl,
we ate crawdad.

72
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,133
When there was no crawdad
to be found, we ate sand.

73
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,926
-You ate what?
-We ate sand.

74
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,888
-You ate sand?
-That's right.

75
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,057
MAN: Well, Hi, you done served
your twenty months...

76
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,518
and seeing as how you never use
live ammo...

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,646
we got no choice
but to return you to society.

78
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,025
SECOND MAN:
These doors gonna swing wide.

79
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,945
I didn't want
to hurt anyone, sir.

80
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,446
SECOND MAN: Hi, we respect that.

81
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,906
MAN: But you're just
hurting yourself...

82
00:03:57,948 --> 00:03:59,867
with this rambunctious behavior.

83
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,869
I know that, sir.

84
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,203
MAN: OK, then.

85
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:04,705
HI: I don't know
how you come down...

86
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,666
on the incarceration question--

87
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,878
whether it's for rehabilitation
or revenge...

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,713
but I was beginning to think...

89
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,549
revenge is the only argument
makes any sense.

90
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,844

00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:18,888

HI:
Hear about the paddy wagon...

95
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:28,482
that collided
with the cement mixer, Ed?

96
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,903
Twelve hardened criminals
escaped.

97
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:35,031
ED: Ha ha! I heard that one.

98
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:36,407
HI: Got a new beau?

99
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,243
ED: No, Hi. I sure don't.

100
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:42,414
HI: Don't worry. I paid for it.

101
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,417
They say that absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

102
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,837
And for once, they may be right.

103
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,924
-You missed a spot.
-Rrr!

104
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:54,177
HI: More and more,
my thoughts turned to Ed...

105
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:57,890
and I finally felt
the pain of imprisonment.

106
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,516
CELLMATE: Mama would throw
the live crawdad...

107
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:02,228
in a pan of boiling water.

108
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,523
One day, I decided to make
my own crawdad...

109
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:09,945
and I threw it in a pot
without the water, you see?

110
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:12,072
And it was just like
making popcorn.

111
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:15,618
HI: Yeah,
the joint is a lonely place...

112
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,078
after lockup and lights out...

113
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,247
when the last of the cons...

114
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:21,833
has been swept away
by the sandman.

115
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,043
But I couldn't help thinking...

116
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:26,255
that a brighter future
lay ahead...

117
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,594
a future that was only
eight to fourteen months away.

118
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:39,894
MAN: They got a name
for people like you, Hi.

119
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:42,564
That name is called recidivism.

120
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:44,483
SECOND MAN: Repeat offender.

121
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,569
MAN:
Not a pretty name, is it, Hi?

122
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:48,738
No, sir.
That's one bonehead name...

123
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,072
but that ain't me anymore.

124
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:52,784
MAN: You're not just telling us
what we want to hear?

125
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:54,577
HI: No, sir. No way.

126
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,788
SECOND MAN: 'Cause we just want
to hear the truth.

127
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,043
HI: Then I guess I am telling
you what you want to hear.

128
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:02,587
MAN: Didn't we just tell you
not to do that?

129
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,255
HI: Yes, sir.

130
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,632
MAN: OK, then.

131
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,634
ED: Turn to the right!

132
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:10,721
HI: I'm walking in here
on my knees, Ed--

133
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:12,264
a free man proposing.

134
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,682
Howdy, Kurt.

135
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,142
HI: And so it was.

136
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,145
DEPUTY:
Don't forget the bouquet, Ed.

137
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,230
I do.

138
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:20,522
You bet I do.

139
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:22,233
OK, then.

140
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:25,904
-Yay!
-Whoo!

141
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:28,407
HI: Ed's pa
staked us to a starter home...

142
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,784
in suburban Tempe...

143
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:32,787
and I got a job
drilling holes in sheet metal.

144
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:34,747
COWORKER: We were doing
paramedical work...

145
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:36,833
in affiliation
with the state highway system.

146
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,043
Not actually practicing,
you understand.

147
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:41,630
Me and Bill
were patrolling down Nine Mile.

148
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,466
-Bill Roberts?
-No, not that mother-scratcher.

149
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:46,636
Bill Parker.

150
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:48,930
Anyway,
we're approaching the wreck...

151
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:50,765
and there's
this spherical object...

152
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,142
resting in the highway...

153
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:55,229
and it's not a piece of the car.

154
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:58,148
HI: Most ways,
the job was a lot like prison...

155
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:01,778
except Ed was waiting
at the end of every day...

156
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,821
and a paycheck
at the end of every week.

157
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:06,283
Government do take a bite,
don't she?

158
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:09,536
HI: These were the happy days--

159
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:12,331
the salad days, as they say.

160
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:16,294
Ed felt that having a critter
was the next logical step.

161
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,171
It was all she thought about.

162
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:22,049
Her point was that there was
too much love and beauty...

163
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:24,344
for just the two of us...

164
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,763
and every day we kept a child
out of the world...

165
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:29,558
was a day he might later regret
having missed.

166
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:34,398
ED: That was beautiful.

167
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:36,316
HI: So we worked at it
on the days we calculated...

168
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,193
most likely to be fruitful...

169
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:42,197
and we worked at it most
other days, just to be sure.

170
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:46,036
Ed rejoiced that my lawless
years were behind me...

171
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:48,120
and that our child-rearing years
lay ahead.

172
00:07:48,162 --> 00:07:49,289
[Siren]

173
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,915
And then the roof caved in.

174
00:07:57,298 --> 00:07:58,507
ED: Hi...

175
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:00,926

HI:
At first I didn't believe it...

177
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:06,390
that this woman
who looked as fertile...

178
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:08,060
as the Tennessee Valley...

180
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:12,648
But the doctor explained
that her insides...

181
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:16,402
were a rocky place where my seed
could find no purchase.

182
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:20,907
Ed was inconsolable.

183
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:24,620
We tried an adoption agency.

ED: It's true that Hi
has had a checkered past.

185

HI: But Ed here is an officer
of the law twice decorated...

186
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,923
so we figure
it kind of evens out.

and the prejudices of others...

188

Our love for each other
was stronger than ever...

190
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:53,902
but I premonised no return
of the salad days.

The pizzazz
had gone out of our lives.

192
00:08:58,323 --> 00:09:01,119
Ed lost all interest
in both criminal justice...

and housekeeping.

194
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:07,918

she tendered her badge.

seemed as dry and bitter...

204
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,116
Then, one day...

205
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:40,078
the biggest news hit the state
since they built the Hoover Dam.

206
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,500

had hit the jackpot.

Now, y'all without sin
can cast the first stone...

224
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,273
but we thought it was unfair
that some should have so many...

225
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:45,527
while others
should have so few.

With the benefit of hindsight...

227
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,616
maybe it wasn't such a hot idea.

Don't print that, son.

NATHAN: A dinner jacket.
What do you think?

574
00:31:29,244 --> 00:31:30,578
He was wearing his damn jammies.

It might have been an employee?

chase down your leads...

590

or sit around drinking
coffee in the one house...

591
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:03,073

where I know my boy ain't at?

any leads aside from the coat.

That's a $500 camel's hair coat!

microbes and whatnot.

00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:03,766
Sure, I'd buy one.

697
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,062
That Buford's a sly one.

698
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:10,148
He already knows his ABCs.

699
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,316
Watch this.

700
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:12,692
Hit the deck, boy!

701
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:17,781
But like I'm sayin',
how'd you get the kid?

702
00:38:19,158 --> 00:38:23,746
This whole thing
is just who knows who.

703
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:25,999
Then over here
you have favoritism.

704
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,460
Ed has a friend
at one of the agencies.

705
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,170
Maybe she can do something
for me and Dot.

706
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:31,630
There's something wrong
with my semen.

That reminds me,
what you gonna name it?

00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,178
Ed. Ed Junior.

709
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,679
But I thought you said
it was a boy.

710
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:41,766
As in "Edward."
We just like that name.

711
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:43,309
Yeah, that's a good one.

712
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:44,686
I don't need another kid...

713
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:46,980
but Dot says these are
getting too big to cuddle.

714
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:48,732

DOT: Then there's
the diphtheria-tetanus.

718
00:38:57,826 --> 00:38:59,829
Get them dip-tet boosters
yearly...

719
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,831
or else they'll develop
lockjaw and night vision.

720
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:04,375
Then there's
the smallpox vaccine...

721
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:05,961
chicken pox, and measles.

722
00:39:06,002 --> 00:39:07,211
If your kid's
anything like ours...

723
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:08,754
you'll have to get
those shots yourself first...

724
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:10,423
before he'll ever take them.

Who's your pediatrician,
anyway?

yet, have we, Hi?

727
00:39:18,224 --> 00:39:20,184

he's got to have his dip-tet.

his dip-tet, honey.

DOT: Have you started
his bank accounts yet?

00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,366
ED: Have we done that?
We got to do that, honey.

737
00:39:39,205 --> 00:39:40,832
you might get by
without orthodontia.

he walks into a bar with a big

to lose some weight...

766

The thing about Dot is...

784
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:45,596
She told me this.

she thinks you're cute.

the same thing about Ed.

I'm talking about wife-swapping.

00:59:30,948 --> 00:59:33,952
I got the cops,
state troopers, Federal B.I...

1043
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:35,745
already looking for my boy.

1044
00:59:35,787 --> 00:59:37,789
Now, if you got information--

1045
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:39,667
Cops won't find your boy.

1046
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:43,796
A cop couldn't find his butt
if he had a bell on it.

1047
00:59:43,837 --> 00:59:47,257
You want to find an outlaw,
you call an outlaw.

1048
00:59:48,092 --> 00:59:50,637
You want to find
a Dunkin' Donuts, call a cop.

1049
00:59:52,597 --> 00:59:56,476
Smalls, first off, get your
damn feet off my furniture!

1050
00:59:56,518 --> 00:59:58,729
Second off, it's widely known...

1051
00:59:58,771 --> 01:00:02,525
I posted a twenty-five-grand
reward for my boy.

1052
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:05,529
Now, if you can find him,
claim it.

1053
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,533
Short of that...
what have we got to talk about?

1054
01:00:11,034 --> 01:00:13,870
Price...fair price.

1055
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:20,128
It's not what you say it is.
It's what the market will bear.

1056
01:00:20,169 --> 01:00:21,713
Simple economics.

1057
01:00:22,505 --> 01:00:24,716
Other people--
and mind you, I know them--

1058
01:00:24,757 --> 01:00:30,180
that'll pay more than $25,000
for a healthy baby.

1059
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:33,017
What are you after?

1060
01:00:33,058 --> 01:00:34,936
SMALLS: Give you an idea.

1061
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:40,400
Why, as a pup, I myself fetched
$30,000 on the black market--

1062
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,278
them was 1954 dollars.

1063
01:00:43,154 --> 01:00:47,366
Now, for fifty grand,
I'll track him.

1064
01:00:48,492 --> 01:00:49,661
I'll find him.

1065
01:00:52,413 --> 01:00:54,416
[Buzz buzz]

1066
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:56,167
Them people that took him...

1067
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,086
I'll kick their butts.

1068
01:00:59,296 --> 01:01:01,049
No extra charge.

1069
01:01:02,424 --> 01:01:04,260
And if I don't pay?

1070
01:01:04,302 --> 01:01:06,971
I'll get the boy, regardless...

1071
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:10,850
but if you don't pay...

1072
01:01:10,892 --> 01:01:13,020
the market will.

1073
01:01:13,062 --> 01:01:14,689
You want to know what I think?

1074
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:18,568
I think you're an evil man.

1075
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:22,781
I think this is nothing
but a goddamn screw job.

1076
01:01:22,822 --> 01:01:24,991
I think it's a shakedown.

1077
01:01:25,033 --> 01:01:27,744
I think you're the one
that took Nathan Junior...

1078
01:01:27,786 --> 01:01:31,123
and you're the one that's
gonna get his butt kicked.

1079
01:01:31,123 --> 01:01:33,626
I'm gonna phone the cops
right now.

1080
01:01:38,048 --> 01:01:39,758
GALE: Up and at 'em !

1081
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,760
Today's the first day
of the rest of your life.

1082
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:43,136
EVELLE:
Already you're messing it up.

1083
01:01:43,178 --> 01:01:45,890
Missis gonna be back
from town soon.

1084
01:01:45,932 --> 01:01:47,599
Where's the baby?

1085
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:49,268
EVELLE:
In the bedroom in his crib.

1086
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,355
He's sawin' toothpicks.
He'll be fine.

1087
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:52,563
[Knock on door]

1088
01:01:56,735 --> 01:01:58,278
GALE: You expecting anyone?

1089
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,697
HI: No.

1090
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:05,202
Ugh...

1091
01:02:05,244 --> 01:02:07,038
You two stay out of sight.

1092
01:02:11,334 --> 01:02:13,253
Mornin', Glen.

1093
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:16,132
I ain't comin' in.
I'll just keep my distance.

1094
01:02:16,173 --> 01:02:18,592
I didn't invite you in, Glen.

1095
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:19,927
GLEN: Don't even bother.

1096
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,472
First off, you're fired.
And that's official.

1097
01:02:22,514 --> 01:02:25,225
I kind of figured that, Glen.

1098
01:02:25,267 --> 01:02:27,936
GLEN: That ain't the reason
I come out here.

1099
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:31,315
No. You're in a whole shitload
of trouble!

1100
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:33,818
Why don't you just calm down?

1101
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,988
Why don't you just make me?

1102
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,531
You know that little baby
you got?

1103
01:02:38,573 --> 01:02:40,659
I know what his real name is.

1104
01:02:40,701 --> 01:02:42,828
Keep your voice down, Glen.

1105
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:46,248
I'll pitch my voice
wherever I please!

1106
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:49,710
His name ain't Hi Junior
or Ed Junior...

1107
01:02:49,752 --> 01:02:51,546
but it's Junior, all right!

1108
01:02:51,588 --> 01:02:53,799
It's Nathan Junior!

1109
01:02:53,841 --> 01:02:55,800
Stay away from me, McDunnough!

1110
01:02:55,842 --> 01:02:58,929
Yeah, you're an awful big man...

1111
01:02:58,971 --> 01:03:01,766
when you got something
to clobber a guy with.

1112
01:03:03,184 --> 01:03:04,685
I ain't a big man.

1113
01:03:04,727 --> 01:03:05,854
GLEN: That's right.

1114
01:03:05,896 --> 01:03:08,523
And now, you're at my mercy.

1115
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:09,608
[Snort]

1116
01:03:10,651 --> 01:03:12,862
I'm your worst nightmare.

1117
01:03:12,904 --> 01:03:14,529
I was just gonna turn you in
for the reward...

1118
01:03:14,571 --> 01:03:16,449
but Dot wants something
to cuddle.

1119
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:21,746
So we'll call the baby
Glen Junior from now on.

1120
01:03:21,788 --> 01:03:24,249
I'll give you a day
to break the news to Ed.

1121
01:03:28,295 --> 01:03:31,132
Dot will be around tomorrow
to pick him up.

1122
01:03:32,758 --> 01:03:35,595
Either that, or you go to jail.

1123
01:03:37,097 --> 01:03:39,057
Say, that reminds me.

1124
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:42,144
You'll be getting a doctor bill
in the mail in a few days.

1125

No. Just circular.

01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:58,748
they usually say
no questions asked.

1384
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:02,627
NATHAN: Oh...do they?

1385
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:03,836
HI: Yeah.

1386
01:24:07,256 --> 01:24:08,425
NATHAN: Well...

1387
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:12,764
all right, boy.

1388
01:24:14,932 --> 01:24:17,310
I guess you got a reward coming.

1389
01:24:19,021 --> 01:24:21,022
Twenty-five thousand dollars...

1390
01:24:22,107 --> 01:24:26,027
or...if you need
home furnishings...

1391
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:28,531
I can give you a line of credit
at any of my stores.

1392
01:24:28,572 --> 01:24:31,618
That's the way I'd rather
handle it. Tax reasons.

1393
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:33,829
ED: We don't want no reward.

1394
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:35,664
We didn't bring him back
for money.

1395
01:24:35,705 --> 01:24:37,290
We could work it that way, too.

1396
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:42,421
ED: Could I just look at him
a little bit more?

1397
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:45,633
Be my guest, little lady.

1398
01:24:49,221 --> 01:24:50,347
But, uh...

1399
01:24:51,806 --> 01:24:54,935
would--would you mind
telling me exactly how you...

1400
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:06,364
You took him...didn't you?

1401
01:25:07,408 --> 01:25:09,034
Wasn't that biker at all.

1402
01:25:09,076 --> 01:25:10,953
HI: I took him, sir.

1403
01:25:10,995 --> 01:25:13,497
My wife
had nothing to do with it.

1404
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:15,292
I crept in yon window--

1405
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:16,876
ED: We both did it.

1406
01:25:16,917 --> 01:25:19,087
We didn't want to hurt him any.

1407
01:25:19,129 --> 01:25:20,589
I just wanted to be a mama.

1408
01:25:20,589 --> 01:25:23,425
HI:
It wasn't for money or nothing.

1409
01:25:23,467 --> 01:25:26,888
We just figured you had more
than you could handle, babywise.

1410
01:25:26,929 --> 01:25:29,640
But I committed
the actual crime...

1411
01:25:29,682 --> 01:25:31,642
so if you need to call
the authorities--

1412
01:25:31,684 --> 01:25:34,188
Shut up, boy. Nobody's calling
the authorities...

1413
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,313
since there's no harm done.

1414
01:25:35,354 --> 01:25:36,482
HI: Thank you, sir.

1415
01:25:36,523 --> 01:25:39,861
NATHAN: Bullshit.
Just tell me why you did it.

1416
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,491
We...

1417
01:25:46,367 --> 01:25:48,077
can't have one of our own.

1418
01:25:53,334 --> 01:25:55,002
Well...

1419
01:25:55,044 --> 01:26:00,007
look, if you can't have kids,
you just got to keep trying...

1420
01:26:00,049 --> 01:26:02,969
and hope medical science
catches up with you...

1421
01:26:02,969 --> 01:26:04,679
like Florence and me.

1422
01:26:05,848 --> 01:26:07,474
Caught up with a vengeance.

1423
01:26:08,809 --> 01:26:12,604
But, hell,
even if it never does for you...

1424
01:26:12,646 --> 01:26:15,233
you still got each other.

1425
01:26:16,234 --> 01:26:20,447
Sir...those are
kind words, but...

1426
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:24,743
I think the wife and I
are splitting up.

1427
01:26:24,785 --> 01:26:27,329
Her point is that
we're both kind of...

1428
01:26:28,164 --> 01:26:30,250
selfish and unrealistic...

1429
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:33,169
so we ain't too good
for each other.

1430
01:26:33,878 --> 01:26:37,757
Well, ma'am,
I don't know much...

1431
01:26:37,799 --> 01:26:39,468
but I do know human beings.

1432
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,973
You brought back my boy...

1433
01:26:43,014 --> 01:26:46,852
so...you must have
your good points, too.

1434
01:26:50,564 --> 01:26:53,150
Sure hate to think
of Florence leaving me.

1435
01:26:54,986 --> 01:26:59,157
I...do...love her so.

1436
01:27:05,539 --> 01:27:06,665
Ahem.

1437
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:11,838
You can go out
the way you came in...

1438
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,633
and before you go off and do
another foolish thing...

1439
01:27:15,675 --> 01:27:17,927
like bustin' up...

1440
01:27:17,969 --> 01:27:20,431
I suggest you sleep on it...

1441
01:27:21,806 --> 01:27:23,350
at least one night.

1442
01:27:25,936 --> 01:27:28,689
HI: That night I had a dream.

1443
01:27:29,565 --> 01:27:32,235
I dreamt I was as light
as the ether...

1444
01:27:33,695 --> 01:27:36,948
a floating spirit
visiting things to come.

1445
01:27:38,576 --> 01:27:41,871
The shades and shadows
of the people in my life...

1446
01:27:41,913 --> 01:27:44,332
rassled their way
into my slumber.

1447
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:50,339
I dreamt that Gale and Evelle
had decided to return to prison.

1448
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,716
Probably that's just as well.

1449
01:27:52,758 --> 01:27:54,510
I don't mean to sound
superior...

1450
01:27:54,551 --> 01:27:57,597
and they're
a swell couple guys...

1451
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:01,976
but maybe they weren't ready yet
to come out into the world.

1452
01:28:04,313 --> 01:28:06,857
And then I dreamed on...

1453
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:08,609
into the future...

1454
01:28:09,568 --> 01:28:12,530
to a Christmas morn
in the Arizona home...

1455
01:28:13,405 --> 01:28:15,992
where Nathan Junior
was opening a present...

1456
01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:18,036
from a kindly couple...

1457
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,330
who preferred to remain unknown.

1458
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:25,711
I saw Glen
a few years later...

1459
01:28:25,795 --> 01:28:28,548
still having no luck
getting the cops to listen...

1460
01:28:28,589 --> 01:28:31,259
to his wild tales
about me and Ed.

1461
01:28:33,345 --> 01:28:36,515
Maybe he threw in
one Polack joke too many.

1462
01:28:37,307 --> 01:28:39,101
I don't know.

1463
01:28:40,937 --> 01:28:43,398
And still I dreamed on...

1464
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:48,445
further into the future
than I'd ever dreamed before...

1465
01:28:49,612 --> 01:28:52,783
watching Nathan Junior's
progress from afar...

1466
01:28:53,826 --> 01:28:57,580
taking pride
in his accomplishments...

1467
01:28:57,621 --> 01:28:59,249
as if he were our own...

1468
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:03,795
wondering
if he ever thought of us...

1469
01:29:04,588 --> 01:29:08,425
and hoping maybe we'd broadened
his horizons a little...

1470
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:12,638
even if he couldn't remember
just how they got broadened.

1471
01:29:15,057 --> 01:29:18,562
But still I hadn't dreamt
nothing about me and Ed...

1472
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,106
until the end.

1473
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:24,277
And this was cloudier...

1474
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:29,324
'cause it was years...
years away...

1475
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:35,164
but I saw an old couple being
visited by their children...

1476
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,209
and all
their grandchildren, too.

1477
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:42,172
The old couple
wasn't screwed up...

1478
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:46,802
and neither were their kids
or their grandkids.

1479
01:29:46,843 --> 01:29:48,470
Dad.

1480
01:29:48,512 --> 01:29:52,557
HI:
And I don't know. You tell me.

1481
01:29:53,392 --> 01:29:54,936
This whole dream...

1482
01:29:56,479 --> 01:29:58,272
was it wishful thinking?

1483
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:04,988
Was I just fleeing reality
like I know I'm liable to do?

1484
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:07,449
But me and Ed...

1485
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:10,994
we can be good, too.

1486
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:14,040
And it seemed real.

1487
01:30:15,793 --> 01:30:17,710
It seemed like us...

1488
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:19,922
and it seemed like...

1489
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,717
well...

1490
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,051
our home.

1491
01:30:25,928 --> 01:30:30,767
If not Arizona,
then a land not too far away...

1492
01:30:32,185 --> 01:30:36,314
where all parents are
strong and wise and capable...

1493
01:30:37,358 --> 01:30:40,236
and all children
are happy and beloved.

1494
01:30:42,488 --> 01:30:43,698
I don't know.

1495
01:30:46,368 --> 01:30:48,035
Maybe it was Utah.

1496
