- It's Christmas. I'm here alone.

171

I don't know what to tell you.

Are you crazy?

173
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,440
[Clerk] I have nothing
I can do for you. I'm sorry.

174
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,176
- There's no one in the store to help me.
Can't you make some?
- Make some? Are you nuts?

175
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,242
- I have got 25 relatives coming.
- It only takes cream, nutmeg...

176
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,915
You don't understand.
What am I gonna do without it?

177
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,255
- I promised them I'd have eggnog!
- You can if you make it.

178
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,693
I can't make it!
You make it!

- Okay.

180

This is a gun in your back.

Who is he?

182
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,369
He's the world beyond our problems,
which is now our problem.

183
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,380

- My God, Carrie, are you all right?

184
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,143
Drive.

185
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,584
[Man #1] Lieutenant Huff, how could
this have happened in Old Baybrook?

186
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,019
[Man #2] Why weren't there
more police on the street?

187
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,081
- This man has been terrorizing
the entire county.
- Look.

188
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,720
I'd put more men on the street, but
they're not qualified for this kind of thing.

189
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,264
Why not? They are police,
aren't they?

190
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:30,769
They have no experience.
Nothing ever happens in this town.

191
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,771
The only time we get
calls from you people...

192
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,637
is when some kid is
playing a practical joke...

193
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,873
or your faggot dogs start humping
each other without permission.

194
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,245
Anytime there's any real problem,
you people call yourjudge friends...

195
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,251
and your attorney general friends
and your district attorney friends.

196
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,254
Why don't you call them now
and get the hell out of my office?

197
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,189
It doesn't necessarily
have to be your office.

198
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,490
I'm calling an emergency meeting
of the Old Baybrook
Emergency Community Committee.

199
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,621
And I'll be suggesting
at that meeting...

200
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,258
that our volunteers patrol
the streets to protect our homes.

201
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,464
And if you would like, Lt. Huff, I will speak
to the mayor... a golfing chum of mine...

202
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,497
about finding you a replacement, since
you don't like it here in Old Baybrook.

203
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,410
And maybe I'll just tell him that
you've hit into a water hazard...

204
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
and you're way in
over your head.

to all this trouble for a thief.

never have taken a couple, would you?

- I did not. There was no stop sign.

might be a videotape of the robbery.

00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,423
- Pass the ketchup.
- Pass the ketchup, please.

329
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,591
I'm not hungry now. I thought
we were eating at Uncle Lloyd's.

330
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,602
God knows what disaster
your Aunt Caroline is making.

331
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,002
This may be our last chance
for normal food.

332
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:58,099
She does it to irritate me.
I'm the one that she's after.

333
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,441
- But I'm not hungry now.
- Eat! Don't annoy me. It's Christmas.

334
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,573
- I'm sure she's going to a lot of trouble.
- Gary.

335
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,584
The last time you ate her cooking,
you had diarrhea for a week.

336
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,086
You had diarrhea
for a week, Dad?

337
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,181
That is not appropriate
dinner conversation. Eat!

338
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:17,718
If we hate Aunt Caroline's
cooking so much, why do we go
there every year for Christmas?

339
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,731
Because my poor Lloyd
needs his family.

340
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,361
Otherwise, he'd be all alone with that
adulteress and her delinquent son.

341
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:29,032
I hope they get into a fight
like always. Their fights are bitchin'.

342
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,599
Shut up.! Don't make me nuts today.!
It's Christmas.!

343
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,247
Merry Christmas.

344
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,580
Ahh. Mmm.

345
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:44,884
So... what's the worst
dive bar near here?

346
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,890
- Seventeenth Hole.
- The Mackerel Lounge.

347
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,516
[Both]
How do you know that?

348
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,528
I passed by once
on the access road.

349
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,656
Did you ever pass by
the Seventeenth Hole?
It's like a urinal with windows.

350
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,829
And the Mackerel Lounge
couldn't be a dive bar, because
they can have entertainment.

351
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:04,633
- ?? It's Christmas
You're drunk and in jail??
- [Phone Ringing]

352
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,677
Mackerel Lounge.
Herbie speaking.

353
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,873
- I'm looking for a friend.
- [Lloyd] The Mackerel Lounge
couldn't be the worst dive bar.

354
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,509
- Can you hang on
just one second please?
- Oh, you happen to know.!

355
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,951
Aah!

356
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,682
Thanks. I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

357
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,421
He's kind of a, uh,
short... drunken loser.

358
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,157
You just described
everybody in the place.

359
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,699
See if there's a guy
named Murray there, okay?

360
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,327
Is there a Murray here?

361
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,201
?? There'll be some whiskey
and a six-pack??

362
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,867
- ?? Not a tree????
- I don't think he's here, pal.

363
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:42,107
See if there's a waste of fucking life
named Murray. Try that one, okay?

364
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,742
Is there a fucking waste
of life named Murray here?

365
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,911
Gus. Uh...

366
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,391
hello?

367
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,895
Murray.
How are ya, pal?

368
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:03,026
- Fine. How are you?
- Oh, fabulous, fabulous.
Of course, I'm a little tired...

369
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:08,505
from running for ten hundred
fuckin'miles because there was
no fuckin'car waiting for me.!

370
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,507
What did I tell you
if something went wrong?

371
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,305
I told you to act like
a drunk vagrant imbecile.

372
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:17,144
- Is that too much of a fuckin' stretch?
- I got nervous.

373
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,877
The cops were
all over the place.

374
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,717
The cops, they've set up a roadblock.
They're checking cars.

375
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,315
- And by 10:00 tonight, there's a curfew.
- Fuck it.

376
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,657
- I just heard it at the bar.
- Fuckin'...

377
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,199
Excuse me.
Is anything wrong?

378
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,297
Lloyd, don't talk to me.

379
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,036
Don't talk to me.
Shut up.

380
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,443
- Don't say anything to me.
Okay? Understand?
- [Murray] Gussie?

381
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,074
- Shh.
- Because maybe we can help, you know.

382
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,119
My God!
I swear to God!

383
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,914
Gussie, where the hell are ya? I'm scared.
I don't think I can handle this.

384
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,017
- I'm...
- Ya been drinkin'?

385
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:07,861
No. No.
What are ya, nuts?

386
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,959
- Listen...
- Calm down, okay? Just calm down.

387
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,061
You gotta help me.

388
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:18,701
I'll tell you what. Go to a place
called Winslow Harbors, okay?

389
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:22,269
- And steal us a boat.
- Boat? Wha...

390
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,612
I'm a car man, Gussie. What the hell
do I know about boats?

391
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:29,347
Figure it out.! I don't care if it's
a barrel as long as it fucking floats.

392
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,016
7:30 now. Curfew starts at 10:00.
That gives you more than enough time.

393
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,218
Ya got a pen?
Write this number down.

394
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:40,788
Okay? 555-353 7.

395
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,800
- Okay? Repeat it.
- 353 7.

396
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:48,896
Listen, kid. Maybe you better
tell me where the swag is, in
case I have to bribe somebody.

397
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,568
- No, Murray. No.
- But...

398
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,874
You can hot-wire station wagons,
you can hot-wire a fucking boat.

399
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:59,542
And just remember,
if you can't, what men your age
become in prison: wet nurses.

400
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,178
Okay, Murray?
Bye-bye.

401
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:07,116
Oh. Thanks.

402
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,888
Ah. Everything's
gonna be fine.

403
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,623
Everything's
gonna be A-okay.

404
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:16,633
We're gonna be in a boat in a couple
of hours. We'll be out of here.

405
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,862
Right back on track.
Right? Right.

406
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,462
[Gulping Loudly]

407
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,478
Ah! Ahh!

408
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,746
Now...
got any cigarettes?

409
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,219
I don't smoke,
and Caroline just quit.

410
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,820
Ah.

411
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,690
Just quit, huh?

412
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:50,161
So... where are they,
Caroline?

413
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,033
What do you mean?

414
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:57,666
Where... are they...
Caroline?

415
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,646
Behind the chessboard.

416
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,239
Chessboard,
chessboard.

417
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,251
What?
You told me you quit.

418
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,516
- Yes!
- I told you I wouldn't smoke in the house.

419
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:17,221
- I never said I quit.
- You said you quit. You hadn't
had a cigarette in three months.

420
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:21,026
I haven't finished a cigarette
in three months. I take a few drags.

421
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,624
- I don't inhale.
- You are such a liar. I don't believe it.

422
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,729
- I am not a liar!
- You sat right in the dining room
and lied to me!

423
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:32,834
- It was in the bathroom.
- I wonder how many other things
you've been lying about.

424
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,471
- Aah! Unh!
- Aah!

425
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,879
[Panting]
Ugh.

426
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,844
Did you say that you
would quit, Caroline?

427
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,550
Did you say
that you would quit?

428
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:54,556
Yes! So you are a liar.
End of story.

429
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,429
[Chuckling]

430
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,763
[Pistol Cocks]

431
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,105
You saw the stop sign,
didn't you, Lloyd? Huh?

432
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:11,444
You... saw... the... stop...
sign... didn't you, Lloyd?

433
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:20,420
- Yes, I did.
- Yes! So you, too, are a liar.

434
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:25,122
Capital "L", small "l",
small "A", small "R", period.

435
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:29,462
Now shut the fuck up.

436
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,231
- [Sniffs] Did you have an accident?
- [Sniffing]

437
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,238
[Grunts]

438
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,276
Ooh! Did you know
you're bleeding?

439
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,006
- Oh, yeah.
- [Lloyd] Were you shot?

440
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,014
- A goddamn dog bit me.
- What dog?

441
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,607
- Willard's dog.
- Cannibal bit you?

442
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:51,712
- His name is Cannibal?
- Yeah.

443
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,554
Um, there are Band-Aids
in the bathroom...

444
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,787
in the master bedroom
upstairs.

445
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,762
What's through here?

446
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,698
That's the mudroom.

447
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:06,828
Use the ouchless.
They're in the green container.

448
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,839
[Sighs]

449
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:13,469
I don't believe it.
You want to have sex with him.

450
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,911
- What?
- "Use the ouchless."
"We have bungee cords."

451
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,919
Ugh.
I'm frightened.

452
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,956
Humans get frightened
because they have feelings.

453
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:30,017
Didn't your alien leaders teach you
that before they sent you here?

454
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,495
I suppose you'll use this drama
as a reason to have another affair.

455
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,762
I feel sorry for the next deliveryman
that comes to this house!

456
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,826
[Doorbell Rings]

457
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,038
Shh.

458
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,337
[Ring]

459
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,571
Okay, our car's
in the driveway.

460
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,079
The lights are on.
They know we're in here.

461
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:53,982
- ???? [Humming]
- [Doorbell Rings]

462
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,319
Who the fuck is that?
Make it quick.

463
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,054
Okay.

464
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,528
Ho ho ho!
Merry Christmas.

465
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,691
Did I catch you
at a bad time?

466
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,826
No, no, no. I was, um,
in the attic.

467
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:16,033
I bet you thought Margaret forgot you
on her fruitcake list.

468
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:19,372
I thought... maybe.
[Laughing]

469
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,174
Well, she would
never do that.

470
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,181
- [Santa Laughing]
- Oh? Great.

471
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,183
- Thank you, George.
- Merry Christmas.

472
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,981
- Thanks to Margaret. Yup. Bye.
- Right. Yeah. Hey!

473
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,283
Did you hear
about the reward?

474
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:36,055
Willard called the radio station
from Bimini when he found out
about the robberies...

475
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:41,963
and he said he'll give $ 100,000
to anyone who captures this guy.

476
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:49,099
- Oop. Okay, bye.
- Well. [Laughing]

477
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,607
I got a lot of children
to see before that curfew.

478
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,610
- Thank you.
- Pay my best to Lloyd.

479
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,579
- Yup.
- And to that son of yours. Uh...

480
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,879
- Jesse. Okay, bye-bye.
- I'm still waiting for our chess rematch.

481
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:05,184
And ifhe happens to know
where the town's babyJesus is...

482
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:10,421
we're still missing it from the lawn
Nativity scene from last year.

483
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,429
- My God.
- Yeah.

484
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,965
Merry Christmas.

485
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,967
Bye.

486
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:29,839
That guy blames Jesse
for everything that happens.

487
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:33,475
And he hasn't played chess
with him for years.

488
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,315
Ah. What's in this?

489
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,754
- I don't know, alum? Don't eat it.
- [Spitting]

490
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,825
- Welcome to the suburbs.
- Yeah.

491
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,831
- Where are those Band-Aids?
- Upstairs.

492
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,833
Show me.

493
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,005
Wow.

494
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,167
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

495
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:03,009
It's my mother-in-law's. Every time
I pass it, I feel her eyes on me.

496
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,413
You want it?

497
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,417
Do I want it?

498
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,419
This is Chagall, right?

499
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:14,049
- This is a real Chagall.
- Yeah.

500
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,720
It really pisses me off.

501
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,730
- Sorry?
- You got something like this
hanging on your wall...

502
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,062
and you don't even
fuckin' appreciate it.

503
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,069
Probably 'cause you never
worked a day in your life.

504
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,007
That's not true.

505
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:33,840
We had our own business once.
We owned a restaurant.

506
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,902
An Italian restaurant.

507
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,609
'Course, I would have
preferred French, but anyway...

508
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,084
- It failed eventually...
- What are we, girlfriends here?

509
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,384
Do I give a shit about this?

510
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,651
No. Let's move.

511
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,659
[Radio]
Cloudy skies, drizzle...

512
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:54,027
- You wanna go for coffee?
- Look, kid, I gotta get home to my family.

513
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,089
This is my lastjob.

514
00:33:56,167 --> 00:34:00,001
Oh, come on.
It can't be that bad.

515
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,165
Look. Can you just drive me
around the block a little?

516
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,300
I'll give you another fifty.

517
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,004
Well, it's your money, pal.

518
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,478
- [Children Yelling]
- [George] Who's been naughty
and who's been nice?

519
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,918
Here we are.! Hey, hey.!
I got one forJohnny here.!

520
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,923
And here's one for Bill.
And for Karen.

521
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,927
- And here's a beautiful looking...
- It's so cold out tonight.

522
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,863
- Do you think Santa would
like something to eat?
- [George] Santa's hungry.!

523
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,901
- [Boy] Let's give him some cookies.!
- Cookies.

524
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,993
- Santa, have a cookie.!
- Over here.!

525
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,006
- Merry Christmas, Santa. [Laughing]
- Uh-huh.

526
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,875
- [Boy] The cookies are good.!
- All right, everybody, tuck in!
Let's eat, huh?

527
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,073
- Here, Santa!
- Enough with the cookies, kids!

528
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,896
You two were gone
an awfully long time.

529
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,996
I got us moved to
a more comfortable place.

530
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,042
What did you have to do for it,
dress his wounds?

531
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,806
Oh, that's right, Lloyd.
We're having an affair.

532
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:19,339
He wants to run away to Acapulco. He
tied me up in case I had second thoughts.

533
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,749
No one goes
to Acapulco anymore.

534
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,811
Our son's walking in here any minute.
Why don't you worry about that?

535
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,825
Look, if we just cooperate,
I'm sure he won't hurt him.

536
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,828
What are you doing?

537
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,922
I think we can get out of these.
Oh, move your body!

538
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,024
Stop that!
What if he walks in here?

539
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,468
We'll just say we're
being... affectionate.

540
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,666
Tied up,
with an armed man in the house?

541
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,766
Works for me.

542
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:17,031
- Just reach down and touch
that clippery thing.
- Listen to me.

543
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,042
I cannot move my arm.

544
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,546
- Oh! Oh, oh! Stop it!
- What's that?

545
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,682
It's nothing.

546
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,275
It doesn't
feel like nothing.

547
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,215
- Just the friction.
- [Chuckling]

548
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,225
Stop it.

549
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,227
[Groaning]

550
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,229
[Chuckling]

551
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,934
Lloyd, you animal.

552
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,065
Haven't you left yet?

553
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,578
- Did ya hear the fuckin' phone ring?
- Look, what about our son?

554
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,910
Well, guess it's gonna be a real Chasser
family picnic, huh?

555
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,884
That's Chasseur.
It's 18th-century French Huguenot.

556
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,755
- Got any extra cord?
- No, we don't have any extra cord.

557
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,591
Okay. Guess we're gonna
have to economize, huh?

558
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,027
- [Horns Honking]
- Move up!

559
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,033
Bring 'em on up.

560
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,592
Keep it moving.
Keep moving.

561
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,935
You, sir. Whoa. Whoa.

562
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,703
- May I see some identifiication, please?
- Certainly, sir.

563
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:31,839
- How can they do this on Christmas Eve?
- There is a criminal at large.

564
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,111
They can't stop
for the holidays.

565
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,983
Maybe they'll let him go
in the spirit of Christmas.

566
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,988
That is not
the spirit of Christmas.

567
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:43,152
The spirit of Christmas is
either you're good, or you're
punished and you burn in hell.

568
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:47,721
- Who would catch a criminal
and then let him go free?
- Republicans?

569
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,626
[Policeman]
Have a merry Christmas.

570
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,773
[Caroline Sighing]

571
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,280
Why don't you
just give yourself up?

572
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:08,512
- What'd you say?
- Well, you're not going to kill
an entire family.

573
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,249
It's over. I mean, you're not the type.
You're a thief, not a killer.

574
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,257
That's obvious.

575
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,351
I hate guys like you,
you know?

576
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:23,128
With yourJeep Grand Cherokees
and your Nicaraguan maids
and your Ping Zing golf clubs...

577
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,931
every goddamn thing in the world
handed to you. What fuckin'
purpose do you people serve?

578
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,632
You're a criminal.
What purpose could you serve?

579
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,641
Fuck you, Lloyd.
I work for a living, okay?

580
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,768
I have a skill.
I'm in the game, pal.

581
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,142
What do you do except
take up fuckin' space?

582
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:40,206
If you're so skilled,
what are you doing stuck here?

583
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:45,449
I can break into any house, take whatever
I want: in and out, ten minutes.

584
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,514
No prints, no evidence,
nothing.

585
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,425
If what's-his-name hadn't installed
that fuckin' roadrunner booby trap...

586
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,397
- I'd be in Jamaica by now.
- Mmm, I'm impressed.

587
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,400
No, you people don't
get impressed, do ya?

588
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,631
Life just bores the shit
out of you people. I'm sorry.

589
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,640
We don't all have rich mummies
and daddies we can live off of...

590
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,871
or open restaurants
when we get bored playing tennis.

591
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,840
You told him
about the restaurant?

592
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:17,320
Yeah. I heard you couldn't cut it working
for a living, Mr. Brooks Brothers, so...

593
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,186
Shut up.!

594
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,926
You and my wife
have a lot in common.

595
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,225
You both think you have some right
to life working out the way you want...

596
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,233
and if it doesn't, you get
to act any way you want.

597
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,735
The problem is someone
has to be responsible.

598
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,738
I'd love to run around taking classes
and playing with my inner-selfness.

599
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:39,037
I'd love the freedom to be a pissed-off
criminal without any responsibility...

600
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,738
except I don't have the time!

601
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,212
But you don't see me with a gun.

602
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,114
You don't see me sleeping
with someone else.

603
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:51,052
You think my life turned out the way
I wanted because I live in this house?

604
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,785
You think every time I look in the mirror
I shout, "Gee, I'm glad I'm me...

605
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,795
"and not some 19-year-old billionaire
rock star with the body of an athlete...

606
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:04,096
and a 2 4-hour erection"? No, I don't!
So just excuse the shit out of me!

607
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,102
- [Door Closes]
- Oh, God!

608
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,104
Shh.

609
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,106
Nice and quiet.

610
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,108
[Footsteps]

611
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,961
[Footsteps]

612
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,564
Are you guys decent?
[Knocking]

613
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,566
Hello?

614
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,568
- Hey.
- Jesse!

615
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,400
- Jesse.
- Who are you? Hey! Watch it!

616
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,907
- You guys okay?
- Hands behind your back.

617
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:28,451
- Wait a second. You're the guy who...
- Shut up!

618
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,545
This isn't your M.O.
You only knock over estates.

619
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:35,058
- But hostages? That's a no-win situation.
- You too, huh?

620
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,889
You know what this family
needs? A mute.

621
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:41,989
Let me say it one more time. I have a gun.
It's loaded. Shut up. Okay?

622
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,125
Yes, but we have people
coming for dinner.

623
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:48,729
- They're driving from Boston.
You gonna tie us all up?
- Five extra people.

624
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:52,799
- Dinner's canceled.
- We can't cancel dinner.
I mean, they're on the road.

625
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,404
- [Lloyd] They'll be here by 9:00.
- Should I shoot one of you in the foot?

626
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,474
Listen. If the police have a curfew,
they might do house-to-house searches.

627
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,851
- You can't stay here.
- That would be very bad for you.

628
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,914
- Really.
- I can't leave until my partner calls.

629
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:12,122
- How do you know he'll call?
- He'll call. He better fuckin' call.

630
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,994
- [Sniffing]
- I swear to God, if he doesn't call...

631
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,999
What smells like piss?

632
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,237
Up against the bed.

633
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,176
Maybe I could
sell tickets. No, no.

634
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:32,511
Let's see. No, no. The...
The point is, in order to get this robe...

635
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,552
You know, I've never seen this movie
all the way through.

636
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:39,680
- Don't you live in this country?
- They show it during the holidays.

637
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,352
With the kids and the family,
I've never seen the whole thing.

638
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,418
- The color of your jacket.
- It's charcoal.

639
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,897
- I didn't know what you were talking about.
- Merry Christmas, Lieutenant.

640
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:54,370
- Yeah, merry Christmas.
- Where the hell are you two going?
Stay here.

641
00:42:56,106 --> 00:43:00,941
- Did you have to say, "Merry Christmas"?
- That's the way I was brought up.

642
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:05,812
- Push rewind.
- Uh... is this it?

643
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,511
No, that's fast-forward.
This is it.

644
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,212
Give me that.

645
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,988
What you're about to see has to be kept
within the confines of this room.

646
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,964
Do you understand?

647
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,834
- Wait a minute.! That's...
- Shh!

648
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,505
- It's old man Willard's place!
- Shh.!

- [Phone Ringing]

651
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,147
- Now listen up.
We're gonna find this guy.
- Precinct.

652
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,785
Watch it a few more times.
Then I'll organize specific teams...

653
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,853
each with a specific
geographic location.

654
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:57,731
Lieutenant.
Some county prosecutor guy?

655
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,134
I'll take it in my office.

656
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,800
- Nobody leaves.
- Yeah, he'll be right with you.

657
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:07,810
Okay, I'll put you
on hold. Thank you.

658
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,144
- Wow!
- Yeah.

659
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:16,983
- Should we watch it again?
- I think we should just wait
'til Huff gets back.

660
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,921
Well, while we're waiting...

661
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,561
I think this is it.

662
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:28,120
No.! It's this one.

663
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,233
Now, you listen to me!

664
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,667
I don't want any plastics
and I don't want any ground foors...

665
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:37,605
and I don't want to get married ever
to anyone.! Do you understand?

666
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,982
Hey.! Who are you?

667
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:30,052
- I'm Murray.
- What do you want?

668
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,061
Is this your boat?

669
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:40,197
[Caroline] That was quite an outburst.
I should tie you up more often.

670
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,704
[Sighs]

671
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:46,106
Listen. About the restaurant,
I didn't say...

672
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,110
How did you
get home again?

673
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,511
- I got a ride with a friend.
- Which friend?

674
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,550
Which friend?
Do I know him?

675
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,812
All right,
I took a limo, okay?

676
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,821
Where'd you get
the money for a limo?

677
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,881
- Okay, I stole one. Is that better?
- Listen, smart-mouth...

678
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:05,417
- If you would answer a simple question...
- Don't talk to him like that.!

679
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:09,091
- You've never disciplined him.!
- If you had not sent him to that prison...

680
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:10,963
[Humming]

681
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:15,403
- I went there.
- For a summer. I go for
my entire high school life.

682
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,236
You were sent there because high schools
wouldn't enroll you anymore.

683
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:23,007
Aye aye aye aye aye aye!
[Making Noises]

684

- That's it!

685
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,984
What the hell is wrong with you people?
You're supposed to be a family.

686
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,486
How can you talk
to each other like that?

687
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,581
Why don't you go on Oprah
and get it over with? Christ!

688
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:37,491
- What's the quickest way to the docks?
- Bainbridge.

689
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,587
You take Main Street and you turn left
on Domino Square.

690
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,098
You can't. Domino Square
is a one-way street.

691
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,158
Bainbridge is the only
two-way street to the docks.

692
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,499
You know, you're never
gettin' out of here.

693
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:51,598
- Why don't you take the highway?
It's quicker.!
- Not the way you drive.!

694
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:55,975
We don't have much time. Pay attention
to any distinguishing features.

695
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:08,791
Now, you listen to me!
I don't want any plastics and
I don't want any ground foors.

- [TV] I'm worth more dead than alive.
- Unbelievable.

705
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,086
No sense of time.

706
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,886
Never again. Never again!

707
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,719
Excuse me. Those dolls are my mother's.
She's been collecting them for years.

708
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,733
- Could you be more careful with them?
- I'm sorry.

709
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:58,738
- If he doesn't call, you're dead in the water.
- Jesse, be quiet.

710
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,744
- Listen to your father, kid.
- I'm only stating the obvious.

711
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,746
What is it,
20 minutes 'til curfew?

712
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,749
And I heard on the radio
they found a ski mask on the scene.

713
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,751
Anyone get
a good look at you?

We now go to the Willard mansion
and to our on-the-scene reporter

that may sound great
when you're 15 years old...

788
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,010
but it sucks just a little bit
when you're 3 5...

things don't go your way.

Well, you know what? Welcome to
the real world, where most of the time...

797
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,638
things don't go
your fuckin' way.

798
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:03,201

Everything goes your way.

00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,075
No arguing. When you fight,
you forget everything else.

808
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,738
Just behave and pay attention,
or I take your son with me.

809
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:41,079
Now, tell me
about this doctor guy.

810
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:48,056
I received a call from Will Warren,
the county prosecutor.

811
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,684
Happens to be
a close friend of mine.

812
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,697
In spite of your bungling,
he's confident they'll find our thief...

813
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,960
in those house-to-house
searches during curfew.

814
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:03,233
Another thing. He said, uh, your men
are to assist and report to me...

815
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,240
as per his instructions.

816
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:09,244
You can call if you'd like.
Um, let's see, one other thing...

817
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,439
Oh, yes, your Christmas
wish came true.

818
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:15,575
[Laughing] You're to be out of here
the day after Christmas.

819
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:19,611
Isn't that a lovely Noel?
It's been swell.

820
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,657
- Bob.
- Yes.

821
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:25,092
- I nailed your wife.
- What?

822
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,595
After the town meeting
last August.

823
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,791
You were in Rhode Island
on business.

824
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,769
Three times, Bob.

825
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:38,800
She said you never
went three times, Bob.

826
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,202
[Knocking]

827
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:50,008
- Merry Christmas, Lloyd!
- Phil, Steve, merry Christmas.

828
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:52,020
- Are you guys working tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

829
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:55,216
They're starting that curfew tonight,
and this is our area.

830
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,022
Thought we might
say hi to Gary.

831
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,790
- Is he here yet?
- Gary.

832
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,856
- Who's Gary?
- He's my brother-in-law.

833
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,333
- They all grew up together.
- Great.

834
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:14,375
- Is that Caroline? I'd love to say hello!
- I'd love to see Caroline.

835
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:18,380
- You know, your wife?
- Of course it is. What am I doing?

836
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,781
She's upstairs. She's chang...
You want a cup of coffee?

837
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,513
- Come on in. In the kitchen.
- Oh, yeah.

838
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:28,489
- Maybe a piece
of pumpkin pie or something?
- Oh, uh...

839
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:33,086
- [Lloyd] Were you guys here last year?
- Yeah, there was a rum cake.

840
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,132
- You guys make great coffee.
- Yeah, it was fantastic.

841
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,999
You guys help yourselves.
I'll go get Caroline, so...

842
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,595
- Unh!
- What is wrong with you?

843
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:46,608
- It would have caused suspicion to say no.
- You never admit you're wrong.

844
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,043
- Finally somebody says it besides me.
- There was no alternative.

845
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,479
I could have been
in the shower.

846
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:56,007
- She could have been wrapping presents.
- What is this, a lying seminar?

847
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,647
- You made a noise. I was distracted.
- He was distracted.

848
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,588
[Grunting]

849
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,728
[Steve] No, I'm not buying wine
for your brother.

850
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:18,103
He can suck on a grape,
Marge. Forget it.

851
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,142
[Marge]
What about the breakfast?

852
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:24,374
- Okay, I'll get the milk and the doughnuts.
- There you go.

853
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:29,111
Mm-hmm. Ye... Marge, hold on.
They got another call comin' in.

854
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,677
Yes, I'll talk
to you later. Hello.

855
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,747
Uh, Gussie?

856
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,884
No, this is Lt. Milford.
To whom am I speaking?

857
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,556
- Uh...
- Ooh, he hung up.

858
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:46,125
- [Phil] Who was it?
- I don't know. Hung up.

859
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,899
- Probably a wrong number.
- Crank call.

860
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,441
- Yeah, kids.
- That's it.

861
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:56,536
- So... ooh, it's late.
- When do you think Gar
might be gettin' here?

862
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,481
Well, maybe what you should do
is go and, um...

863
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,077
when Gary comes, I'll get him
to call you at the office.

864
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:07,248
- Because Christmas Eve,
you're so busy, and l...
- [Phone Rings]

865
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:10,986
Oh, I'll get it. That's it.
Thank you. Hello?

866
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,326
Hello. Uh,
are you feeling better?

867
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:20,267
Who gives a rat's ass
how I feel? Where's Gussie?

868
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,328
I'll get him.
Back in a minute.

869
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,201
I can't believe
I'm working tonight.

870
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,906
I know. Some guy robbin'
people on Christmas Eve?

871
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,778
It's not right.
It's not right.

872
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:39,686
We'll get him though. We got every cop
and his brother lookin'for him.

873
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:43,453
- Christmas Eve, it's...
- Murray.

874
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:48,493
- He hung up.
- Well, he sounded upset.

875
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:52,501
He should be. He's gonna die
a horrible fuckin' death.

876
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,503
[Connie] Caroline.!

877
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,698
Oh! Speaking of which...

878
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:02,108
[Sighs] So, Gary and Connie
and the kids.

879
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:05,773
- [Gary, Connie] Merry Christmas.
- Gar!

880
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,783
- Steve.! Phil.!
- Oh, merry Christmas, Gar.!

881
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:11,446
Mom?
Merry Christmas.

882
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,455
Mom, the TV's broke.
What are we gonna do all night?

883
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,616
- I can't believe this.
- Celebrate the birth of Christ!

884
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,889
- Now, put the presents under the tree.
- Connie, honey...

885
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,862
- Look who dropped by.
- [Both] Merry Christmas, Connie.

886
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:25,299
- [Chuckling]
- I'll take that bag upstairs.

887
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,962
[Mother] I'll take it.
I want to change my shoes.

888
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,972
- Mom, hi.
- Lloyd, who is this?

889
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:36,443
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas. Who is this?

890
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,812
[Lloyd] This is the doctor
we were telling you about.

891
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,249
Doctor... Wong.

892
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,809
Ah, the marriage doctor.

893
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,822
- Right.
- Yeah.

894
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,552
Wong?
You're a Wong?

895
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,390
- Well, my mother was Irish.
- And your father?

896
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,327
- Wasn't.
- Why don't we go downstairs?

897
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,888
- I want to change my shoes.
- [Lloyd] Your shoes are lovely.

898
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,662
- My feet hurt.
- Take 'em off. Go barefoot.

899
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,671
- A Bohemian Christmas! I'm up for that!
- What the hell...

900
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:06,641
is wrong with you? Why do you get
strange at family gatherings?

901
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,176
It's not me, Mom.
It's Caroline.

902
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,508
She's a little nervous
about the dinner.

903
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,777
Maybe you could go tell her what
you think. You know, give her a hand.

904
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,614
You know what
a bad cook she is.

905
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:21,589
Oh. All right.

906
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,126
- Aren't you going to take my bag up?
- Later.

907
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,127
- Well, I'll take it.
- No, no. I'll go, I'll go.

908
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,789
I just wanted to be
close to you.

909
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,333
He, uh...
he loves you so very much.

910
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:40,638
[Phone Ringing]

911
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:44,305
Caroline, could you
come up here for a minute?

912
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,976
- I thought you needed help.
- Yes, well, everything's
in the dining room...

913
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,452
Why don't you light the candles?
That'd be good.

914
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,455
- Bitch.
- Bitch.

915
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:57,425
[Ringing]

916
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,927
- Hello?
- Where's Gus?

917
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:04,929
- Murray?
- How do I know this is Gussie?

918
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:08,903
Because the next time I see you
I'm gonna tear all the hair
out of your balls one by one...

919
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,270
you fucking mule.
How's that?

920
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,775
- [Murray Laughing] Kid, I got good news.
- Yeah?

921
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,641
- A friend of mine's got a boat.
- A friend?

922
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,647
Nobody likes you.
What are you talking about, "friend"?

923
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:22,708
It's somebody I just met, and we kind of
hit it off. I think she really likes me.

924
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,618
She? She? Murray, I've been
in this house all night...

925
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,952
wondering if I'm gonna get busted
or not and you've been fuckin' dating?

926
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:31,460
- Is that it, Murray?
- Calm down. It's the best I could do.

927
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:35,964
- Listen, she's a nice woman.
And she's just...
- [Gus Laughing]

928
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,523
- Skipped parole from New Jersey.
- An ex-con?

929
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,968
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's great. That's just great.

930
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,302
- How do you know
she's not gonna turn us in?
- She wouldn't.

931
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:49,311
She can't afford to.
If she did, she'd be back in
the slammer before she knew it.

932
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,813
Honest.
She's legit.

933
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,782
But there's just one
little problem.

934
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:57,615
- What? Children?
- No.

935
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,247
The boat needs...
a little work.

936
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,258
[Laughing]

937
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,419
[Snorts, Sighs]

938
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,589
[Laughing]

939
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:13,102
[Sighing, Sniffs]

940
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,933
[Chuckling]

941
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:20,442
[Inhales, Sighs]

942
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,702
Hello?

943
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,776
Hello.

944
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,615
- How long?
- Hour, hour and a half.

945
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,555
- Hour.
- Okay.

946
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,956
- You have an hour. Okay.
- Hour.

947
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,291
- Bye-bye.
- All right, bye-bye.

948
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,456
- Last check. Three or four minutes away.
- Proceed to the next house.

949
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,971
Isn't this exciting? I'm sure glad I got
a chance to see Santa while he was here.

950
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,303
[Chuckling] And Santa
would like to toast you all...

951
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,809
for answering
the call of duty...

952
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:58,813
on the holiest of nights.
Everyone, grab a glass.

953
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,849
You too. Grab a glass.
Come on, come on. Grab a glass.

954
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:04,148
- Everyone, come on.
- Santa doesn't drink champagne.

955
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,415
Santa drinks milk.

956
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:10,425
Look, Santa can't drink
any more milk tonight.

957
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,484
Santa has a lactose
intolerance.

958
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,189
It gives him
horrible gas pains.

959
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:16,595
You want to see Santa farting
down everyone's chimney?

960
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:20,762
[Santa Laughing]
Merry Christmas.!

961
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:23,431
[Others]
Merry Christmas.

962
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,474
Ah!

963
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:28,442
[Caroline]
What we're having...

964
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:31,844
is a traditional
Scandinavian Christmas feast.

965
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,940
We have roast suckling pig...

966
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:38,953
fresh baked kringlors
with a honey pecan dipping sauce...

967
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:42,479
seven-day-old lutefisk
and lamb gookins.

968
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:45,288
What you're wearing on your heads
are called Lucia wreaths.

969
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:48,626
They're worn in honor
of Saint Lucia...

970
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:52,293
a brave and noble woman
I admire very much.

971
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:54,632
A woman whose beliefs
were so strong...

972
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:58,231
they rendered
her infammable.

973
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:02,141
As the story goes...

974
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,338
Lucia was engaged
to be married...

975
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,711
and instead of giving her dowry
to her in-laws...

976
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,809
she gave it to the poor people
of the village.

977
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:14,289
Her husband-to-be, thinking
she was out ofher mind...

978
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,121
betrayed her to the Romans
as a Christian...

979
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:20,959
and they condemned her
to burn at the stake.

980
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,624
But although she was
surrounded by fames...

981
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:26,463
she would not burn.

982
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,232
And they had to stab her
with a sword.

983
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,002
My God. Is this
a Christmas story?

984
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:36,408
Who cares.
My forehead is blistering.

985
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,971
- I think it's cool, Aunt Caroline.
- Thank you.

986
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:43,382
Okay, dig in, everybody.
Don't be shy.

987
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:52,193
- Everything looks great, honey.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

[Clears Throat
To Disguise Spitting]

989
01:03:54,697 --> 01:04:00,067
From what school are you trained,
Dr. Wong? Freud?

990
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:03,867
- Uh, nah. I don't go in
for that dream stuff.
- Really?

991
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,272
You don't think patients should
examine their dreams?

992
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,800
Well, I just don't think they should
bother other people with them.

993
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:14,441
I mean, what kind of a loser actually
thinks anybody else is interested?

994
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:20,456
You must have met a great many
strange and disturbed people.

995
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,616
My line of work,
you meet some real wackos.

996
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,627
You call your patients
"wackos"?

997
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,461
Yeah, they...
they like it.

998
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,296
Well, it seems that
this therapy is working.

999
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,962
I've never seen these two
so agreeable together.

1000
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,268
- What the hell am I eating?
- Oh, that's a parsnip kringlor.

1001
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:41,367
- They date back to the fourth century.
- That's what it looks like.

1002
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:46,279
- [Mother] Where's your son?
- Uh, he's spending the night
with a friend.

1003
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:50,080
- On Christmas Eve?
- I think it's very strange.

1004
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:53,144
- Well...
- Well, he...

1005
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,658
Uh, actually,
that was, uh, my idea.

1006
01:04:56,726 --> 01:05:00,628
Because, uh, when one
is constructing...

1007
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:02,664
highways of communication...

1008
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,759
between two people, it's
sometimes a good idea to, uh...

1009
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:10,465
clear the road and slowly
introduce exit signs.

1010
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,473
That's funny.

1011
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,169
I heard something
very similar on Oprah last week.

1012
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:19,146
I assume that as you've built...

1013
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,183
highways of communication...

1014
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,651
you have discussed
Caroline's adultery.

1015
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,779
What?

1016
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,120
You told your mother?

1017
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,955
[Mother] And why not?
He was very upset...

1018
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,121
and he needed someone
he could trust to talk to.

1019
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:37,825
Tell me something,
in your professional opinion...

1020
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,960
- Should these two be married?
- Mother.

1021
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:43,505
[Gus]
Caroline.

1022
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,401
Is that part of the treatment too?
She can't leave?

1023
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:52,970
Yes, Dr. Wong, why don't you
tell us all about your treatment.

1024
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:56,815
In detail.
It'll be so... fascinating.

[Clears Throat]

1028

of complications...

1029
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,927
which, uh,
need to be weaved...

1030
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:17,734
and, uh, woven
into a, uh, quilt...

1031
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:21,504
of some kind.
[Sighs]

1032
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:24,341
It's really expensive treatment.
I can tell you that much.
Costs a hell of a lot of money.

1033
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:26,904
Mmm, these lamb coosins
are great, sweetheart.

1034
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:31,079
They're gookins,
not coosins, honey.

1035
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:35,522
[Mother]
Where I was born, Dr. Wong...

1036
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,616
life and marriage
was less complicated.

1037
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,627
My marriage was arranged,
in fact.

1038
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,959
My husband lived
in the next town...

1039
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:44,192
and our parents
wanted to join farms.

1040
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,700
Really.
What kind of farms?

1041
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,761
Pigs.

1042
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,808
Caroline,
could I have the wine?

1043
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,400
It's all finished.
We have to get another bottle.

Where are you all going?

1045
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:03,581
I gotta stay with them
to, uh, weave the, uh...

1046
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:06,553
Uh... ow!

01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:09,284
Just shut up and eat
your goddamn dinners.

1048
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,918
You won't talk about it in therapy,
but you'll discuss it behind my back...

1049
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:14,087
- With that bitch!
- Hey, she's my mother.

1050
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,097
- She's a fuckin' bitch, Lloyd.
- You are not supposed to take sides.

1051
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,929
No, no, no. Thank you so much, Gus.
Finally somebody else sees.

1052
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:20,935
- You'd have to be blind not to see.
- All right, all right.

1053
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,937
- Let's just get in there
and change the subject.
- Oh, fine.

1054
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:26,099
Why didn't we just change the subject
before I was humiliated?

1055
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,439
That's it, Lloyd.
We are getting a divorce.

1056

I've, you know...
This is finished.

1057
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,620
Now get the hell home, George,
before we call your wife.

1058
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,954
Honestly, George.
What an example.

1059
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:46,290
Santa was
mean to me.

1060
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:49,627
- I'm serious, George.
- Yeah?

1061
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:53,464
Maybe Santa won't
come back next year.

1062
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:55,470
Maybe him
and the Easter Bunny...

1063
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,631
will take a fuckin' cruise
toJamaica...

1064

Oh, who the hell knows,

1068
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,981
I was pregnant
with Jesse then.

1069
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:19,994
We lived
in the most... wonderful...

1070
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:22,690
one-bedroom
apartment.

1071
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,995
You see, Lloyd...

1072
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:28,002
never took any money
from his family then.

1073
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,436
I found that
so attractive.

1074
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,303
And then what happened?

1075
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:35,070
Don't encourage her, Mary.
No one wants to listen to her misery.

1076
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:41,014
Lloyd was working as an assistant
banquet manager at the Sheraton.

1077

why don't you
eat something.

Lloyd, why don't you eat me.

1081
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,154
- [Gasps]
- Kids, go into the den.

1082
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:58,723
- It all turned to shit...
- [Connie] This is not
a conversation for children.

1083
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,702
- It's not a conversation for adults either.
- When Lloyd's father died.

1084
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:06,833
- Where you going?
- The living room,
to leave you to your quilting.

1085
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,639
- [Caroline]
She bribed Lloyd to move back...
- I'll be there to open presents.

1086
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,737
If my plans change,
I'll contact you.

1087
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,282
- I hate Connecticut.
I grew up in Connecticut.
- Why don't we all...

1088
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:18,377
go into the living room. Then we can
have our coffee and dessert in there.

1089
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:22,481
- You phony bastard!
- Caroline, shut up.!

1090
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,492
- Let's all go to the bathroom...
- Sit down, Connie. Sit.

1091
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,120
Excuse me, but I am not
one of your patients.

1092
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:30,461
You're gonna be somebody's
patient if you don't get your
ass back down into that chair.

you hit that kid one more time...

and I'm gonna stick that
pig's head right up your ass!

1096
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,442
Gary, are you gonna let him
talk to me like that?

1097
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,910
- Well, hon, he is a doctor.
- [Laughing]

1098
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:48,507
Okay now, Caroline, Lloyd
and I will go into the kitchen
and get the coffee and dessert.

1099
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,711
- And then we're gonna open the presents.
- We can't open...

1100
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,448
- Presents until midnight.
- Why not?

1101
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,650
- Because it's not Christmas until midnight!
- Guess what.

1102
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,660
We're changing the rules a little bit, okay?
We're gonna open up the presents now.

1103
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,288
Not later, now. Why?
Because we're adults...

1104
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,855
and we can open the presents
whenever we want!

- Let's go.

- [Mother] Why isn't my portrait...

over the fiireplace?

1108
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:20,478
- Have some coffee.
- Go to hell, mama's boy!

1109
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,985
- Caroline, get a grip.
- Or what? What are you
gonna do? Shoot me?

1110
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,146
[Laughing]
You think death scares me?

1111
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,158
You forget, buddy. I have been
married to him for 15 years.

1112
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,320
You forget
I have your son upstairs.

- Here we go.
How's that, Mom? Good?
- Mary, this one's yours.

1116
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:50,501
John, this is to you
from me and Dad.

1117
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,939
- What's that, Aunt Caroline?
- It's an orange...

1118
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,282
marzipan cake with
creme de menthe and lime zest.

1119
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:02,484
- Oh, sounds too sweet.
- Then don't eat it.

1120
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,288
Coffee?

1121
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:12,130
Is it real coffee or some
Scandinavian Christmas potion?

1122
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,967
- How about some music?
- How about some Nat King Cole?

1123
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:20,668
- Oh, Gary loves Nat King Cole.
- [Caroline] Gee, you know
each other so well.

1124
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:23,610
Okay, Nat King Cole it is.

1125
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:32,646
- Oh. Gary, this is for you.
- Oh, thank you.

1126
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:36,919
Oh. This is forJesse.

1127
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:41,827
Uh, we'll just put that
in a pile right over here.

1128
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:44,331
Do you like it, Mary?

1129
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,391
?? Chestnuts roasting
on an open fiire??

1130
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,993
Yeah, it's, uh...
real neat.

1131
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:54,737
Slipper socks!
Oh, I have wanted these for so long.

1132
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:58,769
Thank you, Mother Rose.
Kids, look what Mom got.

1133
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:02,647
[Quietly] You know, with all
her money, what does she think?
She's gonna take it with her?

1134
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:06,085
- I think that's the plan.
- ?? Folks dressed up like Eskimos??

1135
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,591
Oh, Caroline,
this is for you from Lloyd.

1136
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,355
- ?? Everybody knows??
- [Cracks A Nut]

1137
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:16,956
- ?? A turkey and some mistletoe??
- Lloyd?

1138
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,796
Should I stop handing out
the presents?

1139
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,735
Maybe some of us
are not in the mood?

1140
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,574
Caroline?

1141
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:31,739
You see, Dr. Wong, you can use
any treatment you like...

1142
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,782
and it won't do a bit of good.

1143
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,079
The simple truth is...

1144
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:40,645
that she's a nasty, selfish woman
who thinks only of herself.

1145
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:43,988
She has ruined my son's life.
I can attest to that.

1146
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,153
- He has endured such heartache.
- Lady...

1147
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:50,221
why don't you just sleep with him.
Let us all off the hook.

1148
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:53,097
- Shit.
- [Lloyd] Caroline, what are you doing?

1149
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:55,568
What's the point?
You've made your decision.

1150
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,195
What decision?

1151
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,806
Caroline's leaving me.

1152
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,574
We're getting
a divorce.

1153
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:09,447
?? And so I'm offering??

1154
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:12,180
- ?? This simple phrase??
- Why?

1155
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,882
?? To kids from one...??

1156
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:26,466
- Gary, this is to you from me.
- Thank you, bunny.

1157
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:31,973
- Oh, thanks, Mother Rose.
- I bought you the husky size, John.

1158
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,168
You mustn't let your weight
become a problem.

1159
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,405
He does not have
a weight problem.

1160
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:43,317
Oh. Isn't that nice.

1161
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:47,947
Thank you, Connie and Gary
and Mary and John.

1162
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:51,982
[Whispering]
Mom, this is our gift.

1163
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,326
It's to put in the bank.
It's another payment on the loan.

1164
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,094
Oh, thank you, Lloyd.

1165
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:03,901
Of course, we'll have to see
what happens with interest rates
in the new year.

1166
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,769
Cocksucker.

1167
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:11,212
- What did she say?
- She said, "cocksu..."

1168
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,807
you've been sucking us dry
for years on this loan.

1169
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:17,852
- Hey, Caroline.
- No, I have something to say.

1170
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,946
- You gotta problem with that?
- Nope.

1171
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,287
Don't you think
it's gone on long enough?

1172
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:27,795
You both borrowed money to open
that ridiculous restaurant...

1173
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:30,297
which I told you both
would never work.

1174
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:33,732
Well, it might have worked if you could
have taken your tentacles off of him.

1175
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:37,169
- Caroline, stop it.
- If you remember, Caroline...

1176
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:40,731
my husband had just died.
I was all alone.

1177
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,937
- And I had to have surgery.
- Plastic surgery.

1178
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,606
- It was necessary.
- It was nothing more...

1179
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,480
than needing to keep
your son's attention on you.

1180
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:53,749
- Manipulating him to open that store!
- You were practically destitute.!

1181
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,790
I gave him a real job.

1182
01:14:55,858 --> 01:15:00,090
I let you use my home
out of the goodness of my heart.

1183
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,392
You're charging us rent, Rose.

1184
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:05,433
- What kind of therapy is this?
- Come on, now...

1185
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,731
this is getting
a little ugly here.

1186
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,771
Yeah, we walk around
on tiptoes because...

1187
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,772
Mother might get upset
or Mother might get angry.

1188
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,774
And why?
Let's be honest.

1189
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:18,211
She has money, and she holds it over
all of us like a death sentence.

1190
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,215
I'm happy to give
my children everything.

1191
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:23,217
That's the problem!

1192
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,753
One son who can't
say boo to his wife...

1193
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:29,052
and the other one, the other one...
he just gives up.

1194
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:31,217
One bad review
in one lousy magazine.

1195
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:34,490
- You just give up.
- Now just a minute. Stop right there.

1196
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:41,295
In the first place, it wasn't
"one bad review in one lousy magazine."

1197
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,305
- It was the
Restaurant Guidebook of New York.
- Oh, God.

1198
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,638
And when the Restaurant
Guidebook recommends you...

1199
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:51,645
to Hindus looking for
a fun night out of fasting...

1200
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,477
what did you expect me to do,
change the menu?

1201
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:59,783
- You close the restaurant.
- No, you close the restaurant.
Other people try again.

1202
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:04,519
But, you see, everything always
came so damn easy for you.

1203
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,754
But the first time that
you tried something...

1204
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:10,764
that was really important
to you, to us...

1205
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:13,164
and it didn't work out,
what did you do?

1206
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,796
You ran home to Mom.
And then you build this wall...

1207
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:20,535
around yourself, shutting me out,
shutting Jesse out...

1208
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,271
with your cynicism
and your derision!

1209
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,280
And you call that
being responsible!

1210
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,942
Well, I can't live like this.
I don't care if I wind up...

1211
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:32,612
a truck stop waitress with platinum
hair and pineapple earrings!

1212
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:37,284
At least I'd be alive. Be better
than living with a corpse.

1213
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:54,301
Before you, uh, get on with
your career in the service industry...

1214
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:58,073
let's set the record straight.

1215
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:01,741
Because I don't want you leaving
with any misunderstandings.

1216
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:06,246
Maybe you're right.

1217
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:09,586
Maybe I was afraid.

1218
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,150
Maybe I can't...
take failure.

1219
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:15,753
That's probably true.

1220
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:21,098
And maybe it's because
the decision was all up to me.

1221
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,434
It was always all up to me.

1222
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:27,407
You were so afraid of being wrong,
you never made a choice.

1223
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,377
- At least you made it look that way.
- What does that mean?

1224
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:35,747
If you recall,
my first response to my mother's
offer to live here was absolutely not.

1225
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,547
- Lie.
- Absolutely not. You think about it.

1226
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,282
We were sitting in our bedroom
on 78th Street.

1227
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:43,290
We were smoking a joint
and listening to Al Green.

1228
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:45,952
- And I said, "Absolutely not."
- [Connie] I'm sorry...

1229
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,723
but I have had enough!

1230
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:51,288
I have never heard
of such a Christmas.!

1231
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:54,699
Sex and drugs a-a-and
women being set on fire!

1232
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:57,136
- I am taking my children upstairs right now.
- Connie, that's it.

1233
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:01,699
- Sit down and shut up. Okay?
Sit down and shut up.
- Come on, kids...

1234
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:05,144
- We're going upstairs. Gary?
- I think this is more important.

1235
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:09,946
- Well, I think this is sick!
- Connie, honey, right now
nobody cares what you think.

1236
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:13,249
- You have not defended me
once this entire evening!
- Tell her to sit down.

1237
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:15,312
[All Arguing]

1238
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,324
Just sit down and
give these people...

1239
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,622
a little space
to work out their...

1240
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:23,461
- Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me!
- [Glass Shattering]

1241
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:34,772
- If you don't mind,
the corpse still has the foor.
- [Poker Hits Floor]

1242
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:39,837
I told you what moving here
could mean, but you were the one
who said we should consider it.

1243
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:42,850
Not the actual moving,
just the considering.

1244
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:46,354
The actual moving-in part
was left to me. Why?

1245
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,857
Because you didn't know what to do.
You were confused.

1246
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,950
You didn't know what
was the right thing.

1247
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:54,689
But you were sure as hell
sick and tired ofliving...

1248
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:56,697
in a one-bedroom apartment
in New York City.

1249
01:18:56,765 --> 01:19:00,292
So don't hand me that
"it was the best of times" bullshit!

1250
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:03,132
You didn't want to work anymore, and
you didn't want any help with the baby...

1251
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,139
because you wanted
to do it all by yourself.

1252
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,141
And you hated New York...

1253
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,700
because we weren't as rich as your
college friends were to enjoy it.

1254
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,973
We couldn't afford
a bigger place...

1255
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,777
and you were miserable
being around people who could.

1256
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:18,650
And... we were
up to our ears in debt.

1257
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,156
But moving here
was my decision.

1258
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,522
Right! And the loan
was same situation...

1259
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:28,620
What difference does any of this
make now? You're getting a divorce.

1260
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,688
- Mother.
- What?

1261
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,860
Is it possible for you to shut the fuck up
for ten seconds?

1262
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:41,568
Lloyd, don't talk to me
like that in my own house.

1263
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,582
You know what, Mom? You know what
I'm gonna get you next Christmas?

1264
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:53,519
A big wooden cross.

1265
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:57,115
So every time you feel unappreciated
for all your sacrifices...

1266
01:19:57,192 --> 01:20:00,719
you can climb on up
and nail yourself to it.

1267
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:04,232
Gary, get my bags.

1268
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:08,094
- I'm leaving.
- [Connie] Oh.!

1269
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:12,607
Go get them yourself.
He's not your errand boy!

1270
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:15,905
Has everyone gone nuts?
Who the hell do you think you are?

1271
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,673
Slipper socks, medium!

1272
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:26,978
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Hey!

1273
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:33,658
The army? What the fuck?
What am I? Oswald, here?

1274
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,026
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1275
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,621
Hey, hey, no.

1276
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:40,099
Hey, come on.
Come on, will ya?

1277
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:43,660
Ooh!

1278
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:47,230
- [Muffed Grunting]
- Okay, okay.

1279
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:49,607
- Is this part of the therapy?
- [Doorbell Rings]

1280
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:54,741
Now, I want everybody into the den
or I'm gonna shoot her.

1281
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:57,614
- Go ahead, shoot her.
- Shut up!

1282
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,450
Get in the den!
[Growling]

1283

01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,301
[Caroline]
Hi.

1285
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:17,099
[Man] Mr. And Mrs. Chasseur, I'm sorry
to disturb you during the holidays.

1286
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:20,141
I'm Lieutenant Siskel
from the academy.

1287
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,972
Is there some trouble?

1288
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:28,482
Yes, yes, and I couldn't in good
conscience let it wait any longer.

1289
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,484
[Lloyd]
Does it involveJesse?

1290
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:34,454
[Siskel] It does.
Uh, Jesse is a very clever...

1291
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:37,355
and enterprising
young businessman.

1292
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:41,327
He currently has
several photographs of me.

1293
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:44,991
- [Lloyd] Oh, my Lord.
- [Groaning]

1294
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:48,524
Hey, hey, kid.
Kid, that's enough.

1295
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:51,436
- You sure this will hold?
- Yeah.

1296
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:54,703
- [Chuckles]
- I knew...

1297
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:57,108
you weren't a doctor.
I knew it.

1298
01:21:57,178 --> 01:22:00,443
You'll never get away, you know.
You'll either be captured or killed.

1299
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:04,451
One less worthless man around.
One less burden to society.

1300
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,487
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1301
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:09,682
I've survived
worse than you.

1302
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:15,219
World wars, old age,
marriage and weak men like you.

1303
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:18,289
Men who don't have the guts
to survive in the real world.

1304
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:22,632
Men who are just scared little boys
intimidating everyone
with their aggressiveness...

1305
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:25,798
because they're afraid
the world will find out...

1306
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:28,069
how small their penises are.

1307
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:34,644
You know, lady, I'd like to tie you
to the back of a fuckin' truck.

1308
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,741
You don't have the balls.

1309
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,320
- No, no! Don't. It's not worth it.
- I just want to hit her.

1310
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:45,485
- I fuckin' hate her, Lloyd.
- I know. I know.

1311
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,996
Mary,
gag your grandma.

1312
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:53,060
- [Whimpers]
- [Gus] What the fuck is wrong with you?

1313
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:57,102
I thought moms were
supposed to be nice...

1314
01:22:57,172 --> 01:23:01,939
and sweet
an-an-and patient.

1315
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,501
I know loan sharks that are
more forgiving than you.

1316
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:07,946
Your husband ain't dead,
lady, he's hiding.

1317
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:09,950
[Thumping Upstairs]

1318
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:12,009
Let's go.

1319
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,460
Shit.

1320
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:32,097
- Wow.
- Oh, honey.

1321
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:34,300
Is Siskel still here?

1322
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:37,470
[Lloyd]
No.

1323
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:40,412
What are you gonna do, Dad?
Turn me in?

1324
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:44,248
May I ask you
just one question?

1325
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:47,254
Is there something that we don't give you?
What do you need all that money for?

1326
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:48,880
- Drugs? What?
- No!

1327
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:52,051
- More video games?
What more can we buy you?
- Lloyd, no, stop it!

1328
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:54,118
That's it, that's it.

1329
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,322
- Gus, I'm going with you.
I'll give you a cut.
- What?

1330
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:59,265
We can make it to the docks on foot.
We can take a shortcut.

1331
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:00,824
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down.

1332
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:03,063
You gotta take me with you.
I have no other option.

1333
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:07,006
- I can't stay here.
- What am I? The fuckin' circus?
Take you with me?

1334
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,908
- But come on!
- No, forget it. Forget it.

1335
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:11,969
Just forget it,
okay?

1336
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:16,643
Don't start running, kid.
Once you start, you never stop.
Believe me.

1337
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:23,415
Fine.
Fine, be that way.

1338
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:26,790
I'll just go
by myself then.

1339
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:30,627
Oh, please, Jesse, look.
Give us another...

1340
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:35,635
- Oh, Jesse. We screwed up, not you. Oh!
- [Doorbell Rings]

1341
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:39,469
[Sighs]
Shit. Who is that?

1342
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:44,304
Look, I promise you,
we'll take care of this.

1343
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:47,314
We'll fix everything.
No matter what happens
between me and your father...

1344
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:52,285
- You're splitting up?
- That's not your problem, honey.

1345
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:54,821
Hey, I'm in this family too,
you know.

1346
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:58,825
Every time you guys yell and scream
at each other, it is my problem, Mom.

1347
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:01,191
- Caroline, let's go.
- One second.

1348
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,425
Okay, a lot's happened
between me and Lloyd.

1349
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:08,595
We've made a lot of mistakes.
You got caught in the middle.

1350
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,996
Do you hate each other?

1351
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:15,099
[Doorbell
Continues Ringing]

1352
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:17,474
- No.
- Then you're staying together.

1353
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:21,481
- Caroline, come on. Let's go.
- Oh, just wait! Please!

1354
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:26,543
I don't know. I don't know
what your father wants.

1355
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,486
What do you want?

1356
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:32,617
Caroline.
Caroline, come on.

1357
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:38,629
We'll talk about this later, okay?
Just stay here, please.

1358
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,635
- We'll be back soon.
- What about Siskel?

1359
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:44,968
We'll fix it, honey. We'll give him
the money, the photos, anything.

1360
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:47,701
Just... stay right there.

1361
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,974
Hey!

1362
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,415
You know something?

1363
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,249
Lloyd, Caroline...

1364
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:05,588
- Every year we give you
a fruitcake for Christmas...
- Didn't you lock the door?

1365
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:10,097
And you don't give us
a goddamn thing.

1366
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:13,760
My wife thinks
it's because...

1367
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:17,965
Hey, you had a gun,
didn't you?

1368
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:20,269
- Me?
- Yes, you did. You did.

1369
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:23,936
- You had a gun. I saw it.
- No.

1370
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:27,971
- Hey, you're the guy.
You're the guy, aren't ya?
- Okay, pal.

1371
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,746
What, are you pulling a gun on me?
I'm not afraid of you.

1372
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,879
- Just calm down, all right?
- You think you can take me?

1373
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:37,891
I'm Santa Claus.
[Shouting]

1374
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:40,291
- [Gasping]
- [Santa Hits Floor]

1375
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:46,429
Great.
I just beat up Santa Claus.

1376
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:49,470
[Siren Wailing]

1377
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,267
Guys, the cops are here.
What are we gonna do?

1378
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,639
Central, Cruiser 252.
Panella speaking.

1379
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,701
I'm at the Chasseur house.
Over.

1380
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:02,943
- We gotta get you outta here.
- But I can't just leave.
I don't know where I'm goin'.

1381
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:05,349
Just keep pretending like you're
Dr. Wong. Then you don't have to go.

1382
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,411
- There's five people tied up
in the back room. Come on.
- Then we can hide you.

1383
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:09,456
- We can hide you anywhere.
I know this place.
- There's search teams.

1384
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:12,186
They search until they find what
they're looking for. It's a bad idea.

1385
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,627
No, it's a good idea. There's the mudroom,
the trap door in the mudroom.

1386
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,756
- We'll put you in there. It'll be perfect.
- No, no, no.

1387
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:19,823
- Or the trunk of the Beamer.
The trunk of the Beamer's a good place.
- No, no.

1388
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,768
- [Siren Wailing]
- Oh, I know. The hope chest.!
We'll put you in the hope chest.

1389
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:25,931
- I can pretend I've lost the key.
- Forget about it! No, no, no!

1390
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:30,341
[Gus]
What about the basement?
Is there a tunnel or a hole?

1391
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,777
Path through the woods!

1392
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:35,475
Jesse, quick, take Gus
to the path through the woods.

1393
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,347
You said you know a shortcut
to the docks, right?

1394
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,443
You're the only one
that can take him.

1395
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:45,754
Well, what do you want
us to do? Turn him in?

1396
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:52,032
I can't spend my whole life sending
everybody I care about to prison.

1397
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,625
Go on.

1398
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:57,136
Okay, Dad. Come on, Gus.
Let's get outta here.

1399
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:59,503
[Lloyd]
And be careful.

1400
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:03,977
- All right, go, go, go. We'll stall the cops.
- [George Groaning]

1401
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:09,950
If I were a senator...
[Groaning]

1402
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,322
- How many more after this?
- Sixteen.

1403
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,985
- Geez.
- 419, we're over at Seabury Court. Over.

1404
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,324
- 419, dispatch.
- Yeah, we're starting canvassing...

1405
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:23,421
[Knocking]
State police!

1406
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:29,334
There's got to be someone
home with all these lights
and that car in the driveway.

1407
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:32,840
Ah, geez.
We got a live one.

1408
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:35,000
I need some people to surround
this house right now.

1409
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:38,341
Eddie, get your men in here!
Hit it!

1410
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:44,010
[Muffed Talking]

1411
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:46,178
Oh, my God! Thank God you're here!
You've got to hurry!

1412
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:48,449
- You have no idea the nightmare
I've been through!
- He left an hour ago.

1413
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:51,356
- He went to an airport in Hartfo...
Would you shut up?
- The entire night...

1414
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,519
I'm trying to give them
important information. He went
to an airport in Hartford.

1415
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:56,358
Oh, I suppose you're the only one
who's been tied up all night.

1416
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,296
- I didn't say that.
- What is this? A men's club?

1417
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:02,803
Excuse me.! Are there any other
hostages in the house?

1418
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,474
- No.
- No.

1419
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:10,807
- Oh, kid. Ah, Jesus.
- Come on, Gus.

1420
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:12,971
There's no better route
than this with less snow?

1421
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:15,311
No, this is it.
This is the best route.

1422
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:17,977
- This is the best route?
- We'll be there in no time. Come on!

1423
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:20,543
I might need a wheelchair,
I'm telling you, kid.

1424
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:23,488
I distinctly heard him say that he was
headed to a small airport in Hartford.

1425
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:26,823
And from there he was taking
a private plane to Vancouver.

1426
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:28,828
- [Caroline] No, no, it was not Vancouver.
- What's going on?

1427
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:30,830
- [Lloyd] Yes, it was Vancouver.
- We're working on it.

1428
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,833
- He was on the phone,
and he said Yugoslavia.
- Yugoslavia.!

1429
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,994
There is no Yugoslavia anymore.
And who in their right mind
would go there?

1430
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,368
- He's not in his right mind!
- All right!

1431
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:43,007
- Oh, uh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1432
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:45,568
Would you like us to come downtown
and give our statement?

1433
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:48,740
- [Both] No!
- We'd be willing to do that.

1434
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:50,750
- No, no, no, no.
- Thanks anyway. Hey, merry Christmas.

1435
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:53,150
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you very much.

1436
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,155
- Oh. Well, if you're sure.
- Bye. Bye-bye.

1437
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,986
- Good night, everybody.

Hey, George! The curfew!
Go home! Get off the streets!

01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:14,971
Home, George,

Good idea.

01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:23,483
You know, I think things are
gonna be different with Dad.

1444
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:28,818
If they're not, I'll blackmail him.
See ya, Gus.

1445
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:31,324
Take it easy.

1446
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:33,485
Christ.

1447
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:35,995
I'm never having kids.

1448
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:42,328
So do you think
we should go untie everybody?

1449
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:45,497
No. We should unwrap them
in the morning.

1450
01:30:45,573 --> 01:30:48,007
- It'll be more festive.

So what aboutJesse?

1452
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,786
Well, Siskel said if we give him back
the pictures he won't press charges.

1453
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:07,954
No, no, l, um...

1454
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:10,463
What do we tell him
about us?

1455
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:20,140
Oh, Carrie.

1456
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:26,574
Sorry, but Grandma's
eating through her gag.

1457
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:32,482
You know something?
You are a piece of work, pal.

1458
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:35,147
I tell you to get a boat, and this is what
you get? Get out of the fuckin' way.

01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:38,158

Is that what you said?
Presents? I'll tell you what.

1462
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:46,166
As soon as we get back,
we're gonna open the presents.
Matter of fact, I'll tell ya.

1463
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:49,328
I'll save you the trouble. Your present
is a giant, fuckin' cannon, okay?

1464
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:51,337
And when we get back, you're
gonna crawl into it, okay?

1465
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:53,669
I'm gonna put two pounds of gunpowder
in there, I'm gonna light it up...

bag, bring it back to my house...

1469
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:04,951

light 'em on fire. I'm gonna sit
there with a glass of whiskey...

01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,621
- What's that smell?
- Shut up.

1473
01:32:15,897 --> 01:32:18,991
?? Life keeps me waiting??

1474
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:24,467
?? Against my will??

1475
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,975

1483
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:22,789
