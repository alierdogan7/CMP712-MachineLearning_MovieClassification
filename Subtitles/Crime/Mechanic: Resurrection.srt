1
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,082
Five months in Brazil.

2
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,750
You're a hard man to find.

3
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,840
You even have the accent right.

4
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,220
I do say so.

5
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,474
The principal I represent
has an offer for you.

6
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,351
He would like three men killed.

7
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,854
Each death must look like an accident.

8
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,480
Your specialty, I believe.

9
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:57,863
Seems that reports of your demise
have been greatly exaggerated.

10
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:02,200
My principal could make that known
to certain... interested parties.

11
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:07,789
Which means that your new life here
would end rather quickly.

12
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,835
Or you can do the job
and go back to being dead.

13
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,547
What's your pleasure,
senhor Otto Santos?

14
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,178
Let me make a call.

15
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,015
What are you doing?

16
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,270
Tell your principal it never pays
to fuck with the dead.

17
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,501
Get the fuck on the ground!

18
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,128
Get the fuck down!
Don't look at me!

19
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,154
- Bishop.
- Hello, Mei.

20
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,199
You're different.

21
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:54,575
Older.

22
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:56,994
Something more than that.

23
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,956
I need time to find someone
before they find me.

24
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,209
Then I'll be moving on.

25
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,960
Who else is here?

26
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,797
No one. Diving season's over.

27
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,131
Come.

28
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,966
Your home's waiting for you.

29
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,718
How was your trip?

30
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,178
It was okay.

31
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,225
It was a busy season.

32
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,686
But don't worry,
no one came near your home.

33
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,655
Nothing's changed.

34
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,948
Get some rest.

35
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,418
Hi. How can I help you?

36
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,752
Great, you speak English.

37
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,756
I'm running low on first aid.
I'm staying on the boat.

38
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:16,967
Sure.

39
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,514
This is all I have.

40
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,433
Thanks.

41
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,650
If I don't have what you need,
i can call our supply boat.

42
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,820
They can take you back
to Phuket to get it.

43
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,991
No, this is great.
Thanks so much.

44
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:42,159
Anytime.

45
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:02,054
- ...don't fucking tease me!
- Frank-- help!

46
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:03,263
- Help!
- Bishop!

47
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,599
Bishop!

48
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,561
They're fighting. It's bad.

49
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:15,651
You want a piece of me?!

50
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,777
Stay down.

51
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,704
I've met her.
She has a backbone.

52
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,999
Women like that
get killed in these situations.

53
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,669
Domestic squabble, Mei.

54
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,295
Not my business.

55
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,383
You helped me once.

56
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,552
Help her.

57
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,137
Or I will do it.

58
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,019
Hold this.

59
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,432
Frank, get the fuck away from me!

60
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:30,517
Frank!

61
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,810
Not worth it.

62
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,813
Bitch!

63
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,985
Let her go.

64
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,486
Who the fuck are you?

65
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,989
Please, help me.

66
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:48,285
I said, let her go. Last chance.

67
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:50,329
Let go of me, frank.

68
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,455
You don't want to do that.

69
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,248
Fuck you!

70
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,851
Is he dead?

71
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:21,318
Bishop.

72
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:26,406
Shit.

73
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,830
Take her ashore.
I'll deal with the boat.

74
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,998
Okay.

75
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:46,611
- Bishop.
- Where is she?

76
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,405
Sleeping. In your bungalow.

77
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,291
What's going on?

78
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:01,960
Gina Thornton. American.

79
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,920
- That's you, right?
- Yeah.

80
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,174
You're the second woman
who has my picture in her phone.

81
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,468
The first was working
for a guy called crain.

82
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,803
Name ring a bell?

83
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,723
The only thing
you got right was my name.

84
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,349
The first woman was a messenger.

85
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,644
Is that what you are?

86
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,688
So what's the message?

87
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,981
I already told you--

88
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,733
tell me about crain.

89
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,276
What are you supposed to do for him?

90
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,527
Where is he?

91
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,242
Fine. I'll talk.

92
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,169
Look... I don't work for crain.

93
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:46,713
That's the truth.
But he did send me.

94
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,673
Where is he?

95
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,717
- I don't know.
- Why are you here?

96
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,304
He has something on me.

97
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:55,555
I had no choice.

98
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:57,140
Right.

99
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,850
Any of his men nearby?

100
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,477
He didn't say, I didn't ask.

101
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,312
What about frank?

102
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:03,438
Part of the setup.

103
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,774
Explain.

104
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:09,861
He was supposed to get mean,
i escape to this island.

105
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,488
It wasn't meant to be real.

106
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,907
But then frank got drunk
and attacked me.

107
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,201
Crain wanted me to look like a victim.

108
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:17,828
And get next to me?

109
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,205
Yeah.

110
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,374
But frank took his part too far.

111
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:25,085
So we meet. What next?

112
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,879
I use the cell and call
the pre-programmed number.

113
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,966
Let it ring once.
After that, I don't know.

114
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,135
My new girl gets kidnapped is what.

115
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,554
What?

116
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,430
The thought didn't cross your mind?

117
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,355
Okay, so you fall for me,
and crain thinks he has leverage on you.

118
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:46,940
Why?

119
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,484
Well, to force me to do something
i don't want to do.

120
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,570
What is it that you do?

121
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,407
I'll make the call, not you.
I choose when they come.

122
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,492
Then I'll take crain out.

123
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,996
No. I'm not going to help you kill anyone.

124
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,914
Do you really believe that crain

125
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,542
lets the people he blackmails
into helping him, live?

126
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,547
I've spent my whole life
setting people up to die.

127
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,425
I can set you up to live.

128
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,284
My father was a doctor
of eastern medicine.

129
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,744
He was a healer.

130
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,914
Bishop used to study with him.

131
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:46,416
To learn how to heal?

132
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,044
A man like him?

133
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,503
I thought so, too.

134
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:55,091
But my father understood

135
00:18:55,175 --> 00:19:00,931
that those who have been hurt the most
often have the greatest ability to heal.

136
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:57,070
<i>Eighteen months ago,</i>

137
00:19:57,195 --> 00:20:00,991
<i>special military operative, Gina Thornton,
left the war zone in Afghanistan</i>

138
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,077
<i>to offer humanitarian
assistance in Cambodia.</i>

139
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:07,122
<i>After my last deployment,
i just needed</i> a <i>change.</i>

140
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:10,959
<i>Too many innocent people
getting caught in the line of fire.</i>

141
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,211
<i>Rules of engagement
made it impossible to prevent.</i>

142
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:20,593
<i>And then, you know,
when I came to phnom penn, I, uh,</i>

143
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,513
<i>I don't know, it just felt right here.</i>

144
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:29,227
<i>And, um, I felt like I can maybe
do something good with my life.</i>

145
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,788
I can't afford any surprises.

146
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,540
<i>Need to know what cram has on you.</i>

147
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:01,051
I run a shelter for victims
of human trafficking in Cambodia.

148
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:05,180
There's always been an issue or two,
but I've managed to handle it.

149
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:12,437
A few weeks ago...
One of my staff members was kidnapped.

150
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,942
Two days later, she was thrown off a truck
at my front door.

151
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,945
Beaten. Died within an hour.

152
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:27,619
Crain sent this asshole, Jeremy,
who said it was just a taste

153
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:30,580
of what he'd do
to everyone at the shelter.

154
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:33,875
Including the children.

155
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:38,171
They are my weakness.
All the leverage crain needed.

156
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:46,137
So, you see, I didn't have a choice.
I had to do what crain wanted me to.

157
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,172
- What are you doing?
- Hold my hand.

158
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,299
It's for (Brain's people.

159
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,800
They're watching.

160
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,885
Where?

161
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,305
Two men in the zodiac.

162
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,598
Out in the ocean.

163
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,986
There you are.
Come on, you two.

164
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:26,905
You're gonna miss the best part.

165
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,823
Give me your hands.

166
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:36,664
Hold this, please.

167
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,666
- We can just get a drink and...
- No, you will not.

168
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,043
- You will stay right there.
- Mei...

169
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:42,587
- Thank you very much.
- What are you doing?

170
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,590
All couples have to be tied together.

171
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:47,425
But we're not a couple.

172
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,220
You sure looked like it on the beach.

173
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:00,313
So... do you go to weddings... a lot?

174
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:06,152
Not my idea of a good time.

175
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,029
Me neither.

176
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:09,155
Here.

177
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,242
We supposed to drink this?

178
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,369
No. Put your fingertips in it

179
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:18,831
and place three dots
on each other's foreheads for good luck.

180
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,167
- Enjoy.
- I could use some good luck.

181
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,460
"Enjoy"?

182
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,223
Okay, my turn.

183
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:36,975
Come on, let's just get a drink.
Leave that.

184
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,018
All right. One second.

185
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,357
This is a great look for you.

186
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,789
You missed a spot.

187
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,962
It's really kind of stuck.

188
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:09,048
Okay, okay.

189
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,509
Next time, use your shoe.

190
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,395
I love this song.

191
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,524
- This a thai song?
- Yeah.

192
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,568
It's so good.

193
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,240
Wanna dance?

194
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,245
No, don't worry.

195
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,497
I don't-- I don't want to dance with you.

196
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,166
What, you think I'm a bad dancer?

197
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:46,044
- You look like you're a terrible dancer.
- Fine.

198
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:15,114
Hey.

199
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:23,664
I... I just wanted to thank you
for everything.

200
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:25,583
Everything?

201
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:38,054
And I wanted to apologize for...
Getting you into this mess.

202
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:45,311
Those kids are everything to me.

203
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:50,233
If they get trafficked or...
Or killed...

204
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,737
I couldn't bear it.

205
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,282
I understand.

206
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,081
I was an orphan, too.

207
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,919
I was sold to an east end gangster

208
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:12,630
who specialized
in training child soldiers.

209
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:14,131
<i>Cram was there, too.</i>

210
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,218
What happened?

211
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:20,638
I escaped, he didn't.

212
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,601
No doubt they blamed him.

213
00:27:25,684 --> 00:27:27,269
Took it out in blood.

214
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,273
So now he blames you.

215
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,485
Yeah, this is his payback.

216
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:40,324
Oh, god. I'm so sorry.

217
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:42,701
It's not your fault.

218
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:24,594
What are we gonna do?

219
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:32,602
I worked it out.

220
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:36,439
Supply boat from the back side
of the island, out of view.

221
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:38,400
By tomorrow night,
you'll be out of danger.

222
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:40,110
Your kids, too.

223
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:41,903
It's all arranged.

224
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:44,072
<i>What about cram'?</i>

225
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:46,324
I'm not doing his three kills.

226
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:52,789
Once you're safe,
there's only going to be one. Him.

227
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:54,875
But they'll never let you near him.

228
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:58,295
They'll never know I was there.

229
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:05,176
I want you to hold on
to something for me.

230
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,803
Until I come back.

231
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:12,559
My father gave this to me.

232
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:15,937
It's the only memory I have of him.

233
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:22,444
I'll keep it safe.

234
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:00,190
That's (Brain's guy.

235
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:02,233
Look at me.

236
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:05,195
Remember, I'll make sure
to get you home.

237
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:06,363
Trust me.

238
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:29,177
Bishop!

239
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:31,763
Bishop!

240
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:34,349
Help!

241
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:39,521
Bishop!

242
00:31:39,604 --> 00:31:40,981
Bishop!

243
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:52,284
Mr. crain, I have him right here.

244
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:57,038
Tell me how to find you face-to-face.

245
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:31,990
Are we done?

246
00:32:32,949 --> 00:32:34,284
Follow me.

247
00:32:45,962 --> 00:32:47,172
Sit down.

248
00:32:53,345 --> 00:32:54,971
Please, don't move.

249
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:57,641
I'd listen to her
if I were you, Arthur.

250
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,727
No need for guards or guns

251
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:03,230
when the man you want's
sitting on a pound of semtex.

252
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:05,273
How did you find me, riah?

253
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:07,818
What, no, "hello.
Nice to see you after all these years"?

254
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:13,198
But then, you always were one
for getting down to business.

255
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:15,867
How did I find you?

256
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:17,703
You should know better
than anyone, Arthur,

257
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:19,746
there's no privacy anymore.

258
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,623
Not with wonderful things like

259
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:24,793
facial recognition
and satellite tracking.

260
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:29,172
I'm going to give you something
i never give anyone;

261
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:30,256
chance to walk away.

262
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:30,339
Chance to walk away.

263
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,216
Chance to walk away.

264
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:33,885
Give me the girl and walk away.

265
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:38,056
I see you've developed
a sense of humor over the years.

266
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,686
But if it's all the same: No.
I need you. You're the best.

267
00:33:45,564 --> 00:33:46,690
Open it.

268
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:51,903
I need you to eliminate three people.

269
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:53,363
And this is the first.

270
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:56,658
His name is krill.
Mass-murderer and warlord.

271
00:33:56,742 --> 00:34:00,620
He's also the highest-profile
arms dealer in Africa.

272
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:03,790
He's imprisoned
on penjara kaedah in Malaysia.

273
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:06,293
His imprisonment
is what keeps him secure.

274
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:09,296
It's impossible for his enemies
to get to him.

275
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,923
And this?

276
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:14,092
It's important that you
swallow it only after the kill,

277
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:17,345
or the fuel cell will degrade
and we'll never find you.

278
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,930
Where's Gina?

279
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:22,934
Do the three kills, Arthur.
Get the girl back.

280
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:26,313
Even if you don't love her,
you at least owe her, no?

281
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:28,857
I mean, she's in this shit
because of you.

282
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,109
How do I know you'll keep her alive?

283
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:34,321
Finish your kill, get a video call.

284
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:37,157
After the last one, you'll receive
instructions where to find her.

285
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,034
And your word's good, is it?

286
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:42,037
Good heavens, absolutely not.

287
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,707
But I do have a very keen
sense of self-preservation.

288
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:49,211
I know that cheating you
will only make me your target.

289
00:34:49,294 --> 00:34:52,088
And since that concludes
our business for the moment,

290
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:56,718
I wish you <i>bonne</i> chance.

291
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:30,669
Let's get moving, sweetheart, come on.

292
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:33,964
Come on, let's go.

293
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:48,270
<i>The prison is 70 miles out to sea,</i>

294
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:52,148
<i>set atop cliffs
more than 100 meters high</i>

295
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:55,026
<i>and surrounded by shark-infested waters.</i>

296
00:35:55,151 --> 00:35:59,573
<i>So, basically impossible to get in,
and nobody has ever gotten out.</i>

297
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:02,367
<i>It will be even harder to get your man.</i>

298
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,371
<i>He's surrounded at all times
by his team of loyal soldiers.</i>

299
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:10,166
<i>Getting him alone
will be your main challenge.</i>

300
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:52,500
Shark repellent. Yes, sir.

301
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:57,756
Thank you.

302
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:09,392
It's powerful stuff.

303
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:10,977
Hope you know what you're doing.

304
00:38:39,524 --> 00:38:41,234
- Hey!
<i>'</i> Hey, hey, hey, you!

305
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:43,987
What? What?
What do you want, huh?

306
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,364
- Hey, stop.
- Yeah, right.

307
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:48,199
- Stop.
- Fuck you.

308
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:01,004
Martin basman,
you are under arrest.

309
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:52,180
Thank you.

310
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,382
<i>Bishop, remember,
it has to look like an accident.</i>

311
00:40:27,465 --> 00:40:32,262
<i>If he dies with a knife in his back,
no one will be there to pick you up.</i>

312
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:37,016
<i>Good luck.</i>

313
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:03,626
- Who the hell is that?
- Krill.

314
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:03,876
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the sudanese militia.

315
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:03,959
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the sudanese militia.

316
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,341
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the sudanese militia.

317
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:13,303
People say he ate
the hearts of his victims.

318
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,974
Some have relatives who want revenge.

319
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:21,728
Like that guy over there.

320
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:24,814
He used to be krill's best assassin.

321
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:27,984
Now all he wants to do is kill him.

322
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:32,071
But he has his bodyguards
constantly protecting him.

323
00:43:14,924 --> 00:43:17,051
You are a good man.

324
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:19,721
Why don't you join us for dinner?

325
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,309
I'm not sure I like the company.

326
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,439
Then they are not invited.

327
00:44:00,678 --> 00:44:03,431
Hey. Come, come.

328
00:44:03,514 --> 00:44:05,308
Come in, my friend.

329
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:11,939
There are six murders
and <i>23</i> stabbings every week

330
00:44:13,524 --> 00:44:15,401
in this shithole.

331
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:17,445
Most of them pointed at me.

332
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:22,784
That guy you stopped,
he used to work for me.

333
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,580
Maybe he is still upset
that I killed his brother.

334
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:36,214
Loyalty is a scarce commodity
in my line of business.

335
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:41,969
Oh, yes.

336
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:45,264
How did you know
that he would want to kill me?

337
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:46,933
I hear things.

338
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:50,520
My juju tells me everything
that I need to hear.

339
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:53,356
Maybe you weren't listening hard enough.

340
00:44:58,277 --> 00:45:00,029
Do you know who I am?

341
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:02,573
Krill.

342
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:04,992
You run this place.

343
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:07,453
Exactly.

344
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:12,959
And when I get out of this place,
I'm going to run all of Africa.

345
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:15,711
There could be a job
for a man like you.

346
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,050
I already have a job.

347
00:45:21,134 --> 00:45:23,136
- What job?
- You.

348
00:46:35,374 --> 00:46:37,168
Let the man pray.

349
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:38,497
Here he comes.

350
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:50,343
He's right below us.

351
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:52,386
Bring up the net.

352
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:12,740
Nothing in the net, sir.

353
00:49:12,823 --> 00:49:15,826
What the fuck?

354
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:17,495
Looking for someone?

355
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:20,956
I want my call.

356
00:49:25,044 --> 00:49:28,089
Well, bishop survived.

357
00:49:36,764 --> 00:49:37,848
<i>Hello, Arthur.</i>

358
00:49:37,973 --> 00:49:39,100
Happy now?

359
00:49:39,183 --> 00:49:41,185
<i>Nice work on krill.</i>

360
00:49:41,268 --> 00:49:43,229
Prison food'll kill you.

361
00:49:44,313 --> 00:49:45,940
Put Gina on.

362
00:49:46,023 --> 00:49:47,525
<i>Here's your boyfriend.</i>

363
00:49:47,608 --> 00:49:48,984
<i>Hi.</i>

364
00:49:49,068 --> 00:49:50,361
How are you holding up?

365
00:49:50,444 --> 00:49:52,029
<i>I'm okay.</i>

366
00:49:52,113 --> 00:49:56,325
<i>Crain wanted me to let you know that
you have 36 hours</i>

367
00:49:56,409 --> 00:50:00,037
<i>to eliminate the next target,
or they will eliminate me.</i>

368
00:50:00,996 --> 00:50:02,873
That won't happen.

369
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:05,584
<i>Okay, this is all very sweet, Arthur.</i>

370
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:07,628
<i>But you heard what she said.</i>

371
00:50:07,712 --> 00:50:09,672
<i>You need to pick up the pace.</i>

372
00:50:09,755 --> 00:50:12,508
<i>This is your next kill.
Adrian cook.</i>

373
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:35,197
Did bishop tell you where he got this?

374
00:50:39,076 --> 00:50:40,870
It belonged to his father.

375
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:45,791
I never saw him take it off. Never.

376
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:48,836
You know, I wasn't sure
there was anything

377
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:50,755
in the world that could break Arthur,

378
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:54,300
until I saw you wearing this watch.

379
00:50:54,383 --> 00:50:56,719
Now I know he'll do anything for you.

380
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:20,993
<i>In the heart of downtown Sydney,
atop a 58-story high-rise,</i>

381
00:51:21,076 --> 00:51:24,163
<i>is the penthouse suite
owned by Adrian cook,</i>

382
00:51:24,246 --> 00:51:26,707
<i>the mining and minerals billionaire.</i>

383
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,542
<i>Few people know that he originally</i>

384
00:51:28,626 --> 00:51:33,714
<i>made his fortune in human trafficking,
specializing in underage sex workers.</i>

385
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:36,717
<i>He has plenty of manpower
protecting him, of course.</i>

386
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:38,636
<i>But that's the least of it.</i>

387
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,390
<i>There you go.</i>

388
00:51:43,474 --> 00:51:46,393
<i>The Sydney opera house
and the harbour bridge.</i>

389
00:51:52,733 --> 00:51:55,694
<i>Cook's paranoia
is only trumped by his ego.</i>

390
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:58,155
<i>Exhibit a. His cantilever pool.</i>

391
00:52:01,325 --> 00:52:05,579
<i>The walls and floors are all concrete,
three-feet thick.</i>

392
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:11,252
<i>Every door is made
of six-inch nickel chromium steel.</i>

393
00:52:11,335 --> 00:52:13,921
<i>That's like 12 armor plates.</i>

394
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:16,715
<i>And the biometric sensors
and retina readers at the access points</i>

395
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:18,217
<i>are impossible to hack.</i>

396
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:21,220
<i>It's a fortress in the sky.</i>

397
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:53,752
Mr. Clark.
Good to meet you. Shall we?

398
00:52:55,254 --> 00:53:00,259
So each apartment has over 300
square meters of premium living space.

399
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:03,596
But this one gets the Sydney sunset.

400
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,100
The specifications
are all in the brochure.

401
00:53:08,183 --> 00:53:11,020
Let me show you
the detailed floor plan.

402
00:53:11,103 --> 00:53:15,441
We've got Italian tiles
running completely across here.

403
00:53:17,234 --> 00:53:19,612
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sure.

404
00:53:19,695 --> 00:53:22,573
Hello? Samantha burns.

405
00:53:23,782 --> 00:53:25,117
Hello?

406
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:31,957
Sorry about that.
So, where were we?

407
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,959
You were about to tell me
about the floor plans.

408
00:53:34,043 --> 00:53:35,210
Oh, yes.

409
00:54:20,464 --> 00:54:23,425
But we're not dumping on the reef.

410
00:54:23,508 --> 00:54:25,677
"Near" is not on.

411
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:28,555
And if the tree-huggers
do kick up, well, then...

412
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:30,891
Yeah. That's right.

413
00:54:30,974 --> 00:54:34,019
Now I've gotta go.
Now I've gotta go.

414
00:57:53,093 --> 00:57:54,928
Everyone, evacuate!

415
00:57:57,514 --> 00:57:59,349
Call the police!

416
00:58:08,191 --> 00:58:09,734
<i>Billionaire Adrian cook</i>

417
00:58:09,818 --> 00:58:12,487
<i>plunged 76 floors
to his death this morning,</i>

418
00:58:12,571 --> 00:58:16,199
<i>when the glass pool
of his Sydney penthouse collapsed.</i>

419
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:17,451
<i>Although authorities...</i>

420
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:19,536
Give him his call.

421
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:21,413
Okay.

422
00:58:21,496 --> 00:58:23,290
<i>...described his death
as a tragic accident,</i>

423
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:25,625
<i>effectively ruling out foul play.</i>

424
00:58:41,933 --> 00:58:44,186
- Ready.
- Go ahead.

425
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:55,030
<i>Bishop, your watch stopped.</i>

426
00:58:56,281 --> 00:58:57,699
<i>I think it's a sign.</i>

427
00:58:59,117 --> 00:59:00,827
Maybe it just needs cleaning.

428
00:59:01,536 --> 00:59:04,122
No. Look closer.

429
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:09,419
Son of a bitch!

430
00:59:29,022 --> 00:59:30,065
<i>All right?</i>

431
00:59:30,148 --> 00:59:31,900
This the harbor master's office?

432
00:59:31,983 --> 00:59:33,693
<i>Yeah, it is.
How may I assist you?</i>

433
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:36,196
My name is tom silva.

434
00:59:36,279 --> 00:59:40,242
Some bastard in a bloody gray yacht
just scraped my vessel.

435
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:42,118
I have the hull number,

436
00:59:42,202 --> 00:59:44,913
but my insurance
needs the owner's details.

437
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:48,250
<i>Okay, mate. Go ahead.</i>

438
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:53,380
Wrx 489-674-2239.

439
00:59:53,463 --> 00:59:56,049
<i>Okay. Give me one moment.</i>

440
00:59:56,132 --> 00:59:59,761
<i>The vessel's berth is in
Sydney harbour on pier 7.</i>

441
00:59:59,844 --> 01:00:02,430
<i>That's about it.</i>

442
01:00:02,514 --> 01:00:04,307
<i>If you need any further details...</i>

443
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:23,910
<i>The boat you're looking for
is gone, mate.</i>

444
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:27,914
<i>It's a big one, too.</i>

445
01:00:27,998 --> 01:00:31,501
Head out of the harbor.
It couldn't have gone far.

446
01:00:31,626 --> 01:00:33,795
<i>It's your money, boss.</i>

447
01:00:50,729 --> 01:00:52,272
There! East!

448
01:00:54,691 --> 01:00:57,402
Come out of the sun,
so he can't see you.

449
01:00:58,069 --> 01:01:01,239
Drop it down to 60 feet
and hold it steady.

450
01:02:43,174 --> 01:02:45,176
Got it. I'm heading aft deck.

451
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:52,100
Hey!

452
01:03:37,562 --> 01:03:38,980
Take him out!

453
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:42,609
Go.

454
01:03:55,246 --> 01:03:56,331
Go, go!

455
01:04:14,057 --> 01:04:15,683
Bishop!

456
01:04:42,627 --> 01:04:46,589
You know your problem, bishop?
You just can't help yourself.

457
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:48,508
That's how I knew
you'd come back for her.

458
01:04:49,926 --> 01:04:51,803
That's your weakness.

459
01:04:51,886 --> 01:04:54,639
Now do the third kill,
or the girl's dead.

460
01:04:56,474 --> 01:04:59,352
Take him down below.
And give him a proper sendoff.

461
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:58,661
<i>Bishop, if you pull
another stunt like that,</i>

462
01:05:58,745 --> 01:06:03,082
<i>our deal is off, and you'll never
see your little girlfriend again.</i>

463
01:06:07,253 --> 01:06:10,423
<i>Now, playtime's over.</i>

464
01:06:12,967 --> 01:06:17,972
<i>Go to the port town of varna,
on the black sea.</i>

465
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:21,726
<i>That's where you'll find
your third kill.</i>

466
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:28,316
<i>His name is Max Adams,
a wealthy American arms dealer.</i>

467
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:39,410
<i>On the north side of varna,
you'll find a truly vulgar memorial</i>

468
01:06:39,494 --> 01:06:41,245
<i>to Bulgarian communism...</i>

469
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:43,998
<i>Adams spent a fortune restoring it</i>

470
01:06:44,082 --> 01:06:47,168
<i>and putting in the most
comprehensive security system.</i>

471
01:06:56,469 --> 01:06:59,347
<i>But the interesting part
is what you don 't</i> see.

472
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,184
<i>Hidden in the mountainside
below is the sub pen.</i>

473
01:07:04,102 --> 01:07:08,189
<i>Adams stocks his u-boats with
intercontinental ballistic missiles.</i>

474
01:07:10,274 --> 01:07:14,946
<i>Nobody gets in or out.
Many have died trying.</i>

475
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:20,201
<i>So, needless to say, this will be
the hardest site to penetrate by far.</i>

476
01:07:20,284 --> 01:07:24,122
<i>On top of all that, krill and cook's
deaths may have Adams on the defense.</i>

477
01:07:29,794 --> 01:07:31,671
<i>You have 24 hours.</i>

478
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:50,690
You're using me
to take out the competition.

479
01:09:07,558 --> 01:09:09,435
We will dispatch helicopter.

480
01:10:04,073 --> 01:10:05,575
<i>Once you reach the compound,</i>

481
01:10:05,658 --> 01:10:08,244
<i>you'll have to deal with
several layers of security.</i>

482
01:11:18,397 --> 01:11:21,692
<i>The building has
its own power system, oxygen supply,</i>

483
01:11:21,776 --> 01:11:24,070
<i>and a state-of-the-art panic room.</i>

484
01:11:26,405 --> 01:11:27,907
<i>Good luck, Arthur.</i>

485
01:11:55,101 --> 01:11:57,186
Open the goddamn door.

486
01:11:57,311 --> 01:11:58,896
Please?

487
01:12:12,576 --> 01:12:13,911
Call me when you know something.

488
01:12:21,085 --> 01:12:23,796
<i>No sign of the intruder, Mr. Adams.</i>

489
01:12:23,879 --> 01:12:25,506
That's because he's sitting
right in front of me

490
01:12:25,589 --> 01:12:28,009
here in the safe room, jackoff.

491
01:12:29,135 --> 01:12:33,723
Magnificent.
Even if it is all stolen and looted.

492
01:12:33,806 --> 01:12:35,725
Cube-futurist totalitarianism.

493
01:12:35,808 --> 01:12:40,104
Of course it's magnificent.
Like... dinosaur bones.

494
01:12:40,187 --> 01:12:41,355
<i>It's ugly.</i>

495
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:44,650
Who the fuck are you?

496
01:12:44,734 --> 01:12:46,235
I'm here to talk.

497
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,029
Lose your cell phone?

498
01:12:48,112 --> 01:12:50,698
I should've hired
those guys from Houston.

499
01:12:50,781 --> 01:12:52,491
All right, what is it
that you want to talk about?

500
01:12:52,575 --> 01:12:55,244
I want to help you avoid an accident.

501
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:58,331
Krill, cook, that was you.

502
01:12:58,414 --> 01:13:01,667
I warned those guys that one day crain
would come after all of us.

503
01:13:01,751 --> 01:13:03,252
Cappuccino? Espresso?

504
01:13:03,377 --> 01:13:05,129
Espresso. No sugar.

505
01:13:07,757 --> 01:13:11,927
Krill was a warlord, and also the
number-one arms dealer in Africa.

506
01:13:12,011 --> 01:13:15,723
Cook used his mining empire as a cover
to control the Asian franchise.

507
01:13:15,806 --> 01:13:18,768
You got Europe, most of south America.

508
01:13:18,851 --> 01:13:22,063
North America, too,
if you count Mexicans.

509
01:13:22,146 --> 01:13:23,647
That didn't leave much for crain.

510
01:13:24,482 --> 01:13:26,275
So I have a deal for you.

511
01:13:27,026 --> 01:13:30,363
Well, I'm a dealer.

512
01:13:30,446 --> 01:13:31,822
We can talk about it.

513
01:13:39,663 --> 01:13:41,874
I've been called
a lot of ugly names over the years,

514
01:13:41,957 --> 01:13:44,960
communist, socialist, racist, fascist...

515
01:13:45,044 --> 01:13:47,129
None of which is true, of course.

516
01:13:47,213 --> 01:13:48,214
Well...

517
01:13:49,673 --> 01:13:51,634
I'm certainly not a communist.

518
01:13:51,717 --> 01:13:54,428
You just admire
their architecture.

519
01:13:54,512 --> 01:13:56,055
I believe in fair play.

520
01:13:56,138 --> 01:14:00,768
I saw the David and goliath story
play out on the frontlines of Vietnam.

521
01:14:00,851 --> 01:14:04,605
Soviets in Afghanistan.
Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.

522
01:14:04,688 --> 01:14:06,524
Chemical weapons on the kurds.

523
01:14:06,607 --> 01:14:09,693
The little guy is always
gonna need a slingshot,

524
01:14:09,777 --> 01:14:11,904
and somebody's always gonna pay for it.

525
01:14:13,531 --> 01:14:15,324
An arms dealer with a moral clause.

526
01:14:16,742 --> 01:14:21,163
Let's talk about crain.
We both need him gone.

527
01:14:21,247 --> 01:14:24,583
The question is, how do we accomplish
that? He's got an army around him.

528
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:28,212
We need something tempting enough so
that crain uses his men to go after it.

529
01:14:29,255 --> 01:14:33,342
- What do you have in mind?
- Your submarine pen.

530
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:37,221
Have them search
for weapons, treasure...

531
01:14:37,304 --> 01:14:38,472
Your corpse.

532
01:14:39,265 --> 01:14:40,474
What?

533
01:14:41,934 --> 01:14:43,519
You'll have to die.

534
01:14:43,602 --> 01:14:45,312
Well, that's easy.

535
01:14:45,396 --> 01:14:47,481
Although it will cost
a tremendous amount of money.

536
01:14:48,732 --> 01:14:50,109
You can afford it.

537
01:15:02,913 --> 01:15:04,373
Are the boats all secured?

538
01:15:04,498 --> 01:15:06,083
Yes, sir.

539
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:08,002
- Batteries charged?
- Yes, sir.

540
01:15:08,085 --> 01:15:10,296
- Fully provisioned?
- Yes, sir.

541
01:15:10,379 --> 01:15:12,381
You get those Russian girls
in here last night for the crew?

542
01:15:12,506 --> 01:15:13,507
Yes, sir.

543
01:15:13,591 --> 01:15:15,801
Well, looks like we're ready to go.

544
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:25,269
Stay here.

545
01:15:55,966 --> 01:15:58,802
<i>There was an explosion,
and Mr. Adams fell into the water.</i>

546
01:15:58,886 --> 01:16:02,723
<i>His security, they tried to reach him,
but the rocks came down,</i>

547
01:16:02,806 --> 01:16:06,018
<i>and he was buried under the water.
Gone.</i>

548
01:16:11,857 --> 01:16:13,567
Oh, my god.

549
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:20,115
I never imagined that dying would be
so goddamn invigorating!

550
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:21,909
Stay out of sight for two days.

551
01:16:21,992 --> 01:16:24,328
After that,
you can invigorate all you want.

552
01:16:47,518 --> 01:16:49,728
You calling for the driver?

553
01:16:49,812 --> 01:16:52,064
Making dinner reservations?

554
01:16:52,147 --> 01:16:53,774
Checking in with mom?

555
01:16:53,857 --> 01:16:55,859
I'm calling crain
to make sure he takes the bait.

556
01:17:04,034 --> 01:17:06,495
You do know how to put on a show.

557
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:08,247
There's a pier
a few miles north of varna.

558
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:10,499
Be there tomorrow with the girl.

559
01:17:10,624 --> 01:17:12,710
Not until I see Adams' body.

560
01:17:12,793 --> 01:17:16,130
You'll find him
with his most prized possessions.

561
01:17:16,213 --> 01:17:17,756
<i>In his submarine pen.</i>

562
01:17:25,055 --> 01:17:28,434
Get over there. Find Adams' body.

563
01:17:28,517 --> 01:17:31,145
Secure everything inside the pen.

564
01:17:31,228 --> 01:17:33,480
And... what about bishop?

565
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,733
Kill him.

566
01:18:49,181 --> 01:18:52,142
Jeremy, point the camera forward,
so I can see.

567
01:19:11,745 --> 01:19:13,247
All right. Let's go. Fan out.

568
01:19:29,972 --> 01:19:31,306
Where the hell is bishop?

569
01:19:34,685 --> 01:19:36,770
Sir, it's clear.

570
01:19:36,854 --> 01:19:38,105
Two-one clear.

571
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:45,779
- Contact right rear.
- Take cover!

572
01:19:55,873 --> 01:19:57,499
Take cover! Take cover!

573
01:20:27,863 --> 01:20:29,031
Go, go, go!

574
01:20:54,848 --> 01:20:56,391
Motherfucker!

575
01:21:12,282 --> 01:21:13,492
Anything?

576
01:21:13,575 --> 01:21:15,744
No sign of him, Mr. crain.

577
01:21:15,869 --> 01:21:21,291
Stay sharp. Bishop's coming.
You can count on it.

578
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:29,925
- What's going on?
- Your boyfriend's coming to die.

579
01:21:31,051 --> 01:21:33,929
And you're the bait. Move!

580
01:22:04,334 --> 01:22:05,836
Come on, bishop.

581
01:22:07,754 --> 01:22:09,548
I know you're not going to let her die.

582
01:22:11,633 --> 01:22:13,260
Clear.

583
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:19,516
Nothing here.

584
01:22:27,858 --> 01:22:29,234
Yeah, we're clear.

585
01:22:51,882 --> 01:22:53,091
Bring her to the bridge.

586
01:23:08,357 --> 01:23:09,483
Let's move.

587
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:08,286
Let's go. We have three minutes
before it blows.

588
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:20,006
Gina. You okay?

589
01:26:20,924 --> 01:26:22,008
I'll be fine.

590
01:26:24,761 --> 01:26:27,597
Let me see. Oh, shit.

591
01:26:28,098 --> 01:26:30,058
I saw crain doing something
on the console.

592
01:26:32,936 --> 01:26:33,979
What's going on?

593
01:26:34,062 --> 01:26:35,730
Crain is trying to kill us.

594
01:26:36,189 --> 01:26:37,607
Let's go.

595
01:26:38,441 --> 01:26:40,026
Move this shit on the boat, now!

596
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:41,528
Yes, sir.

597
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:45,657
- What is this?
- Just get in.

598
01:26:47,701 --> 01:26:49,536
Wait. What are you doing?

599
01:26:49,619 --> 01:26:50,912
Making sure you live.

600
01:26:50,996 --> 01:26:54,082
No! Come with me! Bishop!

601
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:57,085
- There he is!
- Bishop!

602
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:06,303
Find him. Now!

603
01:27:06,386 --> 01:27:08,138
- ...move!
- Fletcher!

604
01:27:09,055 --> 01:27:10,599
Let's get going-

605
01:28:24,547 --> 01:28:26,258
you never asked why.

606
01:28:26,341 --> 01:28:28,176
I know why.

607
01:28:28,301 --> 01:28:30,136
'Cause I got out, and you didn't.

608
01:28:31,137 --> 01:28:32,639
And here we are again.

609
01:28:32,722 --> 01:28:36,685
You deserted me.
It's time you paid for that.

610
01:28:36,768 --> 01:28:38,144
No chance.

611
01:28:39,729 --> 01:28:41,314
You're gonna get your third kill.

612
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,152
But this one won't look like
an accident.

613
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:40,373
You're a dead man, bishop.

614
01:29:43,918 --> 01:29:46,963
You might get off the boat,
but you'll never swim far enough away

615
01:29:47,047 --> 01:29:48,214
before she blows.

616
01:29:49,215 --> 01:29:50,675
Who said I was swimming?

617
01:29:57,474 --> 01:29:58,850
Bishop!

618
01:30:02,687 --> 01:30:04,397
Bishop!

619
01:30:07,275 --> 01:30:08,943
Bishop!

620
01:30:35,011 --> 01:30:36,304
Hey!

621
01:30:37,764 --> 01:30:39,182
Hey!

622
01:31:03,873 --> 01:31:05,917
Were there any survivors?

623
01:31:07,627 --> 01:31:08,920
No.

624
01:31:24,352 --> 01:31:26,354
So bishop never made it.

625
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:28,106
Even legends die.

626
01:31:49,377 --> 01:31:53,715
<i>Dear Mei. I'm back
in Cambodia with the kids.</i>

627
01:31:53,798 --> 01:31:55,800
<i>The water filter's working.</i>

628
01:31:55,884 --> 01:31:58,553
<i>Thank you so much
for your generous gift.</i>

629
01:31:58,636 --> 01:32:00,472
<i>You have to come here someday.</i>

630
01:32:00,555 --> 01:32:03,558
<i>I think you'd like it a lot.</i>

631
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:08,480
<i>Bishop would have loved it.
See you soon. I hope.</i>

632
01:32:08,563 --> 01:32:11,524
<i>Lots of love, Gina.</i>

633
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:42,240
Clever son of a bitch.

634
01:34:01,843 --> 01:34:03,595
Sneaky bastard.

635
01:34:03,678 --> 01:34:07,640
Bang. You're dead.
