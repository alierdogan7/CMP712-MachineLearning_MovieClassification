00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:25,730
The airport's a good 45 from here,

2
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:29,195
but I figure you'll be all right
if you leave in the next two minutes.

3
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,826
Correct me if I'm wrong, my friend,
but you gave me till 2:15, right?

4
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:38,129
Now you have two minutes.

5
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:40,373
You know,

6
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,209
I been coming here
ever since I was a kid,

7
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:46,697
ever since this was nothing
but old Jews and old Cubans.

8
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:48,946
And to tell you the truth,
I love it here. I really do.

9
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:52,571
I loved it then, and I love it now.
So I'm not gonna leave, so...

10
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:54,596
have a meal with me, okay?
You hungry?

11
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,869
I swear, you pass up...

12
00:00:57,994 --> 00:01:01,244
These are the best crab cakes in town,
I swear to God,

13
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:05,403
much better than that crap we were
eating in Managua. Remember that?

14
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:07,418
I don't know if that was Mexican,
Puerto Rican.

15
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:09,778
I don't know what it was,
but it was crap. I hated it.

16
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:11,456
I didn't mind it.

17
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:13,640
I had some pork dish I quite liked.

18
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:14,629
One minute.

19
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:16,993
But a second ago,
you said two minutes.

20
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,370
- What's going on here?
- Time flies, huh?

21
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:21,758
You.

22
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:23,822
You're a character.

23
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:27,951
I was telling my friends this morning
how yesterday you come to me and,

24
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,758
"If you don't get out of town in
24 hours, I'm gonna shoot you on sight."

25
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:33,798
Come on. What is that?

26
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:36,182
They thought it was a joke.
They started laughing.

27
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:38,698
You tell them
about the man you killed,

28
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:40,273
the way you did it?

29
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,436
'Cause I found
nothing funny in that.

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,023
Then maybe I should've killed you, huh?
Maybe I made a mistake.

31
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:49,204
We all have regrets.

32
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:52,612
Cut me a little slack here, okay?

33
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:57,224
Does nothing count,
that I let you live?

34
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:01,754
I'm giving you the same consideration
right now.

35
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,414
You can get up and go.

36
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,740
30 seconds.

37
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:07,669
So, what are you gonna do?

38
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:11,361
In front of all these people,
you're gonna pull out a gun

39
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:13,508
and you're gonna shoot
an unarmed man?

40
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:15,885
You're unarmed, huh?

41
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:19,526
You got eyes. You see a piece on me?

42
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,559
20 seconds.

43
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:29,232
10.

44
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,468
You know what?
Seriously,

45
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,764
you come in, you interrupt my meal,
you won't eat with me.

46
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,239
This is bullshit.

47
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:39,322
This is supreme bullshit.

48
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,882
US attorney's gonna have
a lot of questions.

49
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,239
Nothing I can't answer.

50
00:03:18,426 --> 00:03:20,938
They might think that you cornered him,
didn't give him a choice.

51
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:23,234
- He had a choice.
- How's the hat, hmm?

52
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,497
I was wondering if it shrunk,
got a little too tight,

53
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:28,908
you took it off your head,
and now you're suffering from sunstroke.

54
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,083
You do know

55
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,754
we're not allowed to shoot people
on sight anymore...

56
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,481
- I didn't.
- And haven't been for,

57
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:36,382
- maybe 100 years?
- He pulled first.

58
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,650
It's not about who pulled first.

59
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:41,971
You remember the meth head last year,
the one who pulled a shotgun?

60
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,546
That ended up on what, page nine?
This... this bullshit...

61
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:48,203
This is gonna be on
the nightly news.

62
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:58,071
Episode 101: Fire in the Hole

63
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:06,702
DOJ inquiry number 359826

64
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:10,780
{\pos(192,220)}into the shooting death
of Thomas Francis Buckley

65
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:13,434
on March 3, 2010,

66
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,196
in Miami, Florida.

67
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:17,761
{\pos(192,220)}Would you like to make a statement?

68
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:20,468
{\pos(192,220)}The marshal's office has conducted
an internal investigation

69
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,950
{\pos(192,220)}of the proceedings

70
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:24,580
{\pos(192,220)}that occurred
at the hotel in question on...

71
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:27,255
Come on,
let's just keep it simple, huh?

72
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:30,062
He pulled first. I shot him.

73
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:38,987
{\pos(192,220)}I thought that went well.

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,986
{\pos(192,220)}You thought that went well?

75
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,103
I got a phone call this morning
from the director.

76
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:45,851
{\pos(192,220)}Before that, the director
got a phone call from the AG.

77
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:48,283
Let me put it to you this way.
The weather forecast

78
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:51,583
is for a shitload of shit raining down
on this office from Washington.

79
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,740
I'm gonna reassign you.

80
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,087
Prison transport?

81
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,897
{\pos(192,220)}No, I'm getting you out of Dodge.

82
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:00,175
{\pos(192,220)}They need manpower
in the eastern district of Kentucky.

83
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:02,469
I talked to the chief of the district,
Art Mullen...

84
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:04,804
Said you guys taught firearms
together at Glynco.

85
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:08,183
{\pos(192,220)}No, no, Dan, I grew up in Kentucky.
I don't want to go back there.

86
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:11,423
We have a problem, because
you don't want to go back to Kentucky,

87
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:14,648
and you cannot,
under any circumstances, stay here.

88
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,822
Got any other skills?

89
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:40,829
{\pos(192,190)}A bit of a comedown
from the Miami office, I'd expect.

90
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:43,287
{\pos(192,220)}Not with you here.

91
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:45,512
{\pos(192,220)}Good to see you.

92
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:48,886
{\pos(192,220)}I won't overwhelm you
with everybody's name right now.

93
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:50,808
{\pos(192,220)}You want to go have a drink?

94
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,935
{\pos(192,220)}Sounds good.

95
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,050
{\pos(192,220)}Follow me, and I'll pack up,
and we'll go.

96
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:58,485
{\pos(192,220)}You look the same
as you did at Glynco...

97
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,601
{\pos(192,220)}Same coat, same boots.

98
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,153
The boots are fairly new.

99
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,008
Don't tell me that hat is.

100
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,078
No, it's old.

101
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:08,569
{\pos(192,220)}Have a seat.

102
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:14,458
You were working fugitives
in Miami, huh?

103
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,542
Yeah, I did.

104
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:19,097
{\pos(192,200)}Here, everybody does everything...

105
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:21,214
{\pos(192,200)}Fugitives, witness relocation,

106
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:22,945
{\pos(192,220)}judicial protection,

107
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,255
{\pos(192,200)}forfeitures,

108
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,627
prisoner transport.

109
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,320
Boy, every office I ever worked in,

110
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:29,431
prisoner transport
was the shit detail...

111
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,567
Chief always used it as punishment.

112
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,240
But here we all do it.

113
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:35,474
{\pos(192,220)}- Even you?
- No. Hell no.

114
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,772
I heard about you and Winona.

115
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:39,051
From who?

116
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,192
Winona.
She works here.

117
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:42,777
In Lexington?

118
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,405
In the courthouse...
She's a court reporter.

119
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,492
{\pos(192,220)}I knew she was coming back to Kentucky.
I think her mom took ill.

120
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,453
I thought that was
why you picked Kentucky.

121
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,354
{\pos(192,220)}Art, no offense...

122
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:55,290
{\pos(192,220)}I didn't pick Kentucky.

123
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:59,534
{\pos(192,220)}I talked to your marshal
down there in Miami.

124
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,213
Tell me about the shooting.

125
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,731
It was justified.

126
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:08,845
You concerned
about me coming down here?

127
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,210
{\pos(192,220)}It's a small office, Raylan.

128
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,767
{\pos(192,220)}I'm concerned
when we switch brands of coffee.

129
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:18,104
{\pos(192,220)}Is your dad still down there
in Harlan?

130
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:19,903
Far as I know.

131
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:21,922
Thought you were from there.

132
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:24,493
Reason I ask... The US attorney's
trying to build this case

133
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,553
against this guy in Harlan.
And he's about the same age as you,

134
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:28,740
it's a small town,

135
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:31,075
thought you might know him...
Boyd Crowder.

136
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:34,829
My God, Art, any other shit
you want to dump on me tonight?

137
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,660
- You do know him.
- Yeah. I know him.

138
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:41,374
Boyd and I dug coal together
when we were 19.

139
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,422
Boyd,

140
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,109
what do you think?

141
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:48,947
Jared, I think it sucks.

142
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:50,476
What? Why?

143
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:53,978
I appreciate the sentiment,

144
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:58,107
wanting to go after a federal building
under construction.

145
00:07:58,557 --> 00:08:01,289
But, you see, we'd need us a whole box
of Emulex to bring that down,

146
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,122
and that's if you got cuts
in the steel.

147
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,342
And all we got's a rocket launcher.

148
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,900
And impressive as that is,
the only thing it's gonna do

149
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:10,825
is knock some shit around.

150
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,744
Don't you worry about it.
We'll just go to plan B.

151
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:15,911
Plan B?

152
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,380
There's always a plan B.

153
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:30,254
Now, it used to be a couple
of crackers in an SUV.

154
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,329
Would set the jungle on edge.

155
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:34,957
These surely are end times.

156
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,519
All right, this is it right here.

157
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,981
Let's shoot straight up here,
make a right.

158
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:50,321
This is good right here.

159
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:54,022
I believe we can take her from here.

160
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:57,704
What, you gonna blow up that church?

161
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,874
Boyd!
There's people on the streets.

162
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,687
They're gonna see us.
They're gonna ID my car.

163
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:05,662
You worried about your car?

164
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:12,193
You know, I just crushed...

165
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:13,470
Fire in the hole!

166
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:29,944
Boyd became a powder man.

167
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:34,197
He'd crawl down the hole
with his case of Emulex 520,

168
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:38,028
come out stringing wire, call out
"Fire in the hole" to clear the shaft.

169
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:40,914
She'd blow, and we'd go back in,
dig out the pieces.

170
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:44,386
We weren't what you'd call buddies,
but you work a deep mine with a man,

171
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,411
you look out for each other.

172
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,612
After that, he joined the army,

173
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:50,675
and he went to Kuwait
for desert storm,

174
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,264
and when he came back,

175
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:53,796
after a couple years,

176
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:55,671
he quit paying his taxes,

177
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:58,102
claimed that he was
a sovereign citizen,

178
00:09:58,227 --> 00:10:01,728
and so US attorneys sent him down
to Alderson.

179
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:05,464
That's where he got involved
with the patriot movement

180
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:07,982
and the white-supremacy bullshit,

181
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:10,652
got them making horseshit bombs,
you know,

182
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:12,594
fertilizer and fuel oil.

183
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:16,197
They'll come into a town like Somerset,
and they'll blow up a car.

184
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,244
And then while the cops are busy,
they'll go rob a bank.

185
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:20,912
Saw that in a Steve McQueen movie.

186
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,290
These guys ain't movie actors.

187
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:26,622
Did he change much?

188
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,511
Other than the fact
he's now a racist asshole.

189
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:32,882
He's lost some hair,

190
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:34,803
but that's about it.

191
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,811
How come you didn't want
to blow up that church?

192
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,339
I told you.

193
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:06,791
I didn't want them to ID my car.

194
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:08,342
I got to thinking

195
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,467
that maybe you had an aversion
to hurting people.

196
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,175
Hell no.

197
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,184
I also got to thinking

198
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:17,802
that a building under construction

199
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,990
might just be
the kind of innocuous target...

200
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:22,631
You know what that means?
That means harmless.

201
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:24,585
It might just be
the kind of harmless target

202
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,945
that the Federal Bureau of Imperialism
might be willing to sacrifice

203
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,608
in order to get somebody
deep in the movement.

204
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,383
You think I'm a snitch?

205
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,116
All I know
is you don't have any tattoos,

206
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:38,129
you keep rubbing that head like you
don't think that hair's gonna grow back.

207
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:40,672
You think I'm a snitch
'cause I rub my head?

208
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:43,434
You understand
where I'm coming from, right?

209
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:47,165
You come out here from Oklahoma...
Full of piss and vinegar,

210
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,803
talking about how you were tired
of spray-painting synagogues,

211
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:52,080
saying you want
to blow some shit up.

212
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,103
You don't believe me,
you check it out.

213
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,778
- Why don't you call Oklahoma?
- We are.

214
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,366
Devil's doing it as we speak.

215
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,578
You'll see, Boyd. I ain't no snitch.

216
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:07,704
Like you said,

217
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
we'll see.

218
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,875
Right there.

219
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:17,568
- Turn that shit off.
- Why don't you eat my ass?

220
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,190
- How'd it go?
- Out of the way.

221
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:21,859
- Get over.
- The primary was a waste of time,

222
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:23,827
but took care
of the secondary just fine.

223
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,930
- Where you at?
- East of 75 on Tates Creek road.

224
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,292
We got a call from Oklahoma.

225
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:32,981
Jared checks out.

226
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,605
<i>How'd he do?</i>

227
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,385
I had to let Jared go.

228
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:45,932
Was it 'cause you didn't trust him
or you just didn't like him much?

229
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:48,468
Probably a little bit of both.

230
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,748
I am gonna need you to pick me up,
though.

231
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,683
I will show that my client
did not engage in fraud.

232
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:14,558
A report by a forensic accountant
will show that any anomalies

233
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:17,483
are due entirely
to a misentering of amounts,

234
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,856
a common bookkeeping error,

235
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:21,898
and by no means fraud.

236
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,760
Thank you, counselor.

237
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,950
Will the prosecution
please approach the jury?

238
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:28,826
Thank you, your honor.

239
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:31,945
It might seem like
a simple technical mistake,

240
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:34,943
but the state will prove
there was malicious intent...

241
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,118
One second.

242
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:41,538
Sorry. I was in the courthouse.
I'll be up in a minute.

243
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,873
Tates Creek road.

244
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:49,078
I think I know where that is.

245
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,168
County sheriff's deputy
found it just after dawn.

246
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:09,682
Name's Jared Hale.

247
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,152
Bureau has him listed
as some kind of Aryan knight,

248
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:14,977
Oklahoma driver's license
and registration.

249
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,023
You got him connected to Boyd?

250
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:20,266
- So far, tenuously.
- I talked to his sister in Tulsa,

251
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:24,364
and she said that he came to Kentucky
to hook up with some commandos.

252
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,627
Now, that's probably the murder weapon.
It's recently been fired.

253
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:31,302
There's no prints on it.
In fact, the whole vehicle's clean,

254
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:32,791
except for this.

255
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:36,453
Now, do you know what that is?

256
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:38,027
I didn't, either.

257
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:41,106
That is the cap that goes
on the end of a rocket launcher.

258
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,231
No shit.

259
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:46,292
Last night in Lexington,
we had a church bombing.

260
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:49,722
And the feeb says that whoever did it
used a rocket launcher.

261
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:59,033
All the wits say the same.

262
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:01,317
Two white males drove up
in a dark SUV.

263
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,590
They parked
at that corner by the curb.

264
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:06,715
One male got out
with what looked like a bazooka.

265
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,393
He said a few words
and then fired at the church.

266
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,515
What did he say,
the fella that got out of the SUV?

267
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,977
One said it was "Liars and hos."

268
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:17,902
Another heard "Time to go."
My favorite's "Heidi heidi heidi ho."

269
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,628
Maybe we should put out
an APB out on cab calloway.

270
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,446
- I think he's dead.
- Then he should be easy to find.

271
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:25,125
The pastor had it different.

272
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,802
He heard the man say,
"Fire in the hole."

273
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:31,518
You know what?
Why don't you just go just do your job?

274
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:34,227
Did the good pastor say he got
a good look at the shooter?

275
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,864
- He says no.
- I bet if we put crowder in a lineup

276
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:39,195
and told the pastor
that the trigger man was there,

277
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,523
it might jog his memory.

278
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,484
Rachel, why don't you go
ask our old friend

279
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:44,402
if he'll have a word with us?

280
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:49,040
- Be nice.
- When am I ever not nice?

281
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,769
You think Fandi's gonna want
to cooperate?

282
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:58,251
Fandi is Ethiopian by way of Jamaica

283
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,926
by way of being
completely full of shit.

284
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:04,349
The temple of the cool
and beautiful JC

285
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:08,219
was one of those churches that claims
that marijuana is a sacramental herb.

286
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:11,355
- It is protected by the constitution.
- The constitution of dope sellers?

287
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,929
'Cause selling ganja to kids
means you're a drug dealer.

288
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,554
I could've sworn
I told her to be nice.

289
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:19,904
Pastor Fandi, if I could just
talk to you for just one moment...

290
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,314
No, you could not.

291
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:24,261
I saw Peter Tosh once.

292
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:29,614
You assume 'cause I'm black and have
a Jamaican accent, I like reggae?

293
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:34,594
People assume a lot about me.
It's the way of the world.

294
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:39,986
How was he, Peter Tosh?

295
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:45,399
It was not my taste,
but the girl I was chasing loved him.

296
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:48,716
And I let her stay till the encore
before I took her off to jail.

297
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,516
What do you want?

298
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:17,370
That was a close one.

299
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:19,414
I felt the air move.

300
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,600
What's all the fuss?
They out of Velveeta?

301
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:40,185
Your brother got shot.

302
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:42,168
What? Where?

303
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:43,354
At his house.

304
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:46,525
No, dumb-ass, where on his body?

305
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,736
- I don't know.
- Is it serious?

306
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:52,264
He's dead.

307
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:54,945
Did you know Bowman Crowder,
Boyd's brother?

308
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,381
Sort of.
Star running back in high school.

309
00:17:58,274 --> 00:18:00,742
Boyd was always saying Bowman
had the goods to go pro.

310
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,039
I was never that sure.

311
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,243
You remember
the girl he married, Ava?

312
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:07,170
If it's the same one,
she lived down the street.

313
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,092
- She's married to Bowman?
- She was.

314
00:18:09,217 --> 00:18:12,793
She ended the union
last night with a. 30-06,

315
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:14,511
plugged him right through the heart.

316
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,371
That's the sheriff's report.
She admits shooting him, says she got

317
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:21,259
tired of Bowman
getting drunk and beating her.

318
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:23,990
She still in custody?

319
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:26,671
She was arraigned
10 minutes ago, ROR.

320
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,192
Did you talk to her?

321
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,666
I did.
I told her, given Boyd's reputation,

322
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,596
he's probably gonna come
looking for her.

323
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,401
She said it's none of our business.

324
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,307
I told her it is if he shoots her.

325
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:39,994
We should go talk to her again.
Is that the address?

326
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:44,082
Yeah, but good luck on finding it.
I tried to map it, got nothing.

327
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,927
I guess some places haven't been
entered into the system,

328
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:51,089
like North Korea
and Raylan's hometown.

329
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:53,785
I know where it is.

330
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:32,647
My god.

331
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:35,389
You remember me?

332
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,710
I never forgot you.

333
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:53,712
I had a crush on you
from the time I was 12 years old.

334
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:58,582
I knew you liked me,
but you didn't want to show it.

335
00:19:58,707 --> 00:19:59,866
You were too young.

336
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:01,910
I was 16 when you left.

337
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,752
I heard you got married.

338
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,772
Are you still?

339
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,502
Turned out to be a mistake.

340
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:14,480
Want to talk about mistakes?

341
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:16,612
I told Bowman I wanted a divorce.

342
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:20,382
He goes,
"you file, you'll never be seen again."

343
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,733
He said I'd disappear
from the face of the earth.

344
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:26,893
Do you want a drink?

345
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,278
I'd love one.

346
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:35,041
I married him a year out
of high school 'cause he was cute,

347
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,843
he was sure of himself, and he told me
he'd never work in a goddamn coal mine.

348
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,687
He'd wear the blue and white
of the university of Kentucky,

349
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:44,362
and then he'd get drafted
by a pro team.

350
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,204
He wouldn't mind the cowboys.

351
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:51,834
What do you want in yours?
I got diet Coca-Cola, RC Cola,

352
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:53,088
Dr Pepper.

353
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:54,213
Just ice.

354
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,715
I ever forget to fill the trays,
Bowman would start slapping me.

355
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,802
"What's wrong with you?
Don't you know how to keep house?"

356
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:03,575
And that all started
as soon as he realized

357
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,950
he was never getting out of Harlan.

358
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:10,159
He blamed it on me,
said it was my fault he had to dig coal.

359
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:14,752
It was my fault that I had a miscarriage
after he beat me with his belt

360
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,350
and...

361
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:19,195
he didn't have a son
to take hunting with him

362
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,810
and his creepy brother, Boyd.

363
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,681
Last time he hit me was

364
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:32,454
because I called his brother
creepy to his face.

365
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:34,877
He kept after me

366
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:38,596
with that belt till I fell
and I hit my head on the stove.

367
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:44,190
I got up off that floor knowing
that he was never gonna hit me again.

368
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:47,207
The next night,

369
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:48,506
he came in,

370
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,297
I had his favorite supper
on the table...

371
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:54,072
Ham and yams and cream-style corn

372
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,180
and left over okra
fixed with tomatoes.

373
00:21:58,106 --> 00:22:00,822
I waited till he was shoveling
food in his face.

374
00:22:01,323 --> 00:22:03,364
Then I got his deer rifle
from the kitchen closet.

375
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:06,360
And I went in there,
and I did what I had to do.

376
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,075
I just finished cleaning up.

377
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,842
I had to scrub the wall with lysol,

378
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,942
to get the stain off of it.

379
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:18,797
Lysol's the best cleaning product
you can buy.

380
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,426
I still got a knot

381
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:26,564
where I fell and I hit my head
on the stove.

382
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,337
You want to feel it?

383
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:30,016
Dear lord, my hair's a mess.

384
00:22:31,187 --> 00:22:34,637
You close your eyes.
I don't want you to see me like this.

385
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:42,528
The minute you walked in, I knew
everything was gonna be all right.

386
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:46,442
I was right about you.

387
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:48,443
About what?

388
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:52,031
Having a crush on you.
You're a good kisser.

389
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:55,852
I was thinking we'd have
to stop doing that.

390
00:22:56,328 --> 00:22:57,377
Why?

391
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:01,563
This isn't a social call, Ava.

392
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,967
Came down to Harlan on business.

393
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,150
You tell me all about your business
when I get out of the shower.

394
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,400
Who the hell are you,
the undertaker?

395
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,000
I might be undertaking
a situation here.

396
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:28,825
Let me see your chest.

397
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,890
You buy that necklace or poach
the gator and yank her teeth out?

398
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:41,129
I shot her and ate her tail.

399
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:43,673
That would put you in Florida,
around lake Okeechobee.

400
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,258
Belle Glade.
Who are you?

401
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:49,095
I'm a deputy...
United States marshal.

402
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,363
You mind telling me who you are?

403
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:55,012
You know your name, don't you?

404
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,103
I'm Dewey Crowe.

405
00:23:57,578 --> 00:23:59,576
I sent a boy to Starke
from Belle Glade,

406
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:01,274
fella named Dale Crowe Jr.

407
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:03,901
He's my kin.

408
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,552
What are you doing here, Mr. Crowe?

409
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:10,742
- I come to take Ava someplace.
- Hold on.

410
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,359
Let me tell you something.

411
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:16,026
You don't walk into a person's house
unless you're invited.

412
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:17,939
What you better do is go on outside,

413
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:19,664
you knock on the door.

414
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:23,656
Ava wants to see you, I'll let you in.
She don't, and you can be on your way.

415
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:31,228
All right.
I'm gonna go out.

416
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,558
And then I'm coming back in.

417
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:55,453
You better hold on there a sec
while I explain something to you.

418
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:58,974
I want you to understand.

419
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,709
I don't pull my sidearm
unless I'm gonna shoot to kill.

420
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,123
That's its purpose,
to kill, so it's how I use it.

421
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:11,553
I want you to think about that
before you act and it's too late.

422
00:25:12,056 --> 00:25:15,337
Jesus Christ,
I got a scattergun pointed right at you.

423
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:21,506
Can you rack in a load
before I put a hole through you?

424
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:36,202
- Where'd you want to take her?
- I don't understand you.

425
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,259
- Boyd want to see her?
- It's not your business.

426
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:41,257
You know Boyd and I were buddies?
We dug coal and drank beer together.

427
00:25:41,382 --> 00:25:44,932
In fact, you see him,
you tell him I'm in Harlan, all right?

428
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:53,154
If I was you,

429
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,329
I'd give up this Nazi bullshit,

430
00:25:55,632 --> 00:25:57,932
go back to poaching gators... safer.

431
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:00,185
Next time I see you, I'm gonna...

432
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:06,065
You tell Boyd his old buddy
wants to see him...

433
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:18,745
Only reason I don't take
Ava out and shoot her...

434
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:22,081
'Cause I see she had no choice
in what she done.

435
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,092
Don't get me wrong.
I loved my brother.

436
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:27,117
But you knew Bowman.
You knew how he could get.

437
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:31,220
And that woman, she showed some spunk...
You think about it...

438
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,635
Doing what she did.
And then there's the bible.

439
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,901
In the bible, it says that a man should
see to the needs of his brother's widow,

440
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:38,389
and I intend to do that.

441
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,519
They sure are taking
their sweet time.

442
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,762
Let me ask you something.

443
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:47,598
Shouldn't we have our money
from your boys in Lexington by now?

444
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:50,064
I'll give them a call.
Don't worry. They're good for it.

445
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:52,046
You damn right they're good for it,

446
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:55,801
'cause if they aren't, I'll go down
there and blow their shit up, too.

447
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,039
Come on.

448
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,375
Let's go!

449
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:07,627
Right now?

450
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:09,170
Right now!

451
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:11,464
Come on, let's go!

452
00:27:20,991 --> 00:27:22,372
Who was that?

453
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,554
The one with the "Heil Hitler"
on his neck?

454
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,729
He was one of Bowman's buddies.

455
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,119
You haven't seen Boyd,

456
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:34,759
I mean, since?

457
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:41,989
But he'll be after me, I know.
He's been after me.

458
00:27:42,638 --> 00:27:44,967
That's why we want
to keep an eye on you.

459
00:27:45,092 --> 00:27:47,793
You know I'm...
I'm with the marshal's service.

460
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:50,503
I believe your mother told me
before she passed.

461
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:53,146
You been to see your father?

462
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:59,041
Are you looking for Boyd?

463
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,390
We are.

464
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:03,914
But we have
to catch him in the act...

465
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,968
Robbing a bank,
blowing up a church...

466
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:09,867
Making an attempt on your life.

467
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:11,691
Mine?

468
00:28:12,032 --> 00:28:14,782
You said yourself
he'll be coming after you.

469
00:28:17,723 --> 00:28:19,623
Boyd don't want to shoot me.

470
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:21,592
He wants to... you know,

471
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:23,794
go to bed with me.

472
00:28:26,864 --> 00:28:29,224
You want me to help you catch him?

473
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:31,711
Maybe you could just

474
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:33,379
get him to talk to me.

475
00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:35,899
I could do that.

476
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,081
You know where he is?

477
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:39,426
I do.

478
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:44,599
And did you want to tell me?

479
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:48,096
What do I get if I do?

480
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:11,876
Who you know drives a town car?

481
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,019
Look at you...

482
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:18,603
A suit,

483
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:20,301
a necktie,

484
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:22,208
looking good,

485
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:24,635
looking like a lawman.

486
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,566
Now, see,

487
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:31,825
this is how you wear a hat,
all casual,

488
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,347
not down on your goddamn ears
like you do.

489
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,277
I heard you called on Ava.

490
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:39,505
My boy Dewey
said he had to run you off.

491
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,697
You believe that?

492
00:29:41,338 --> 00:29:42,947
Not if you say it ain't so.

493
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,422
- I'll take care of him.
- Get us a jar and two glasses.

494
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:49,653
This party's just for Raylan and me.

495
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:50,915
Go on.

496
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:58,798
He just got his release,
so he's feeling a little itchy.

497
00:29:59,286 --> 00:30:00,300
I can tell.

498
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:06,765
Old times.

499
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:16,775
You been gone too long.

500
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,113
God damn.

501
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:21,154
So, what...

502
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:23,239
What was life like in Florida?

503
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:26,671
Just as advertised...
Sunny and hot.

504
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,373
I just don't think
I could take me a place so flat.

505
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,670
You seen your daddy yet?

506
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:35,684
No, not yet.

507
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:38,872
Boy, he was a wild man
back in his day, wasn't he?

508
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:41,532
What was that scam
he had going back in the early '90s...

509
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,417
Stealing mining machinery,

510
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:47,546
selling it to the colombians, getting
paid in cocaine... You remember that?

511
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:49,932
Guess I was gone by then.

512
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:51,476
How's your daddy?

513
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:54,614
I suspect you know how my daddy is.

514
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,562
Yeah, all those days, good and bad,
they all long gone now.

515
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:02,737
Everything's changed.
It's all changed. Mining's changed.

516
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,712
No more following
a seam underground.

517
00:31:05,837 --> 00:31:07,820
Cheaper to take
the tops off mountains

518
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:10,795
and let the slag run down
and ruin the creeks.

519
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,836
You remember the picket lines,
don't you?

520
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:16,876
Courts backing
the company scabs and gun thugs.

521
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:22,696
Whose side you think
the government's always been on,

522
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:24,521
us or people with money?

523
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,120
And who do you think
controls that money?

524
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:29,538
Who do you think

525
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:31,663
wants to mongrelize the world?

526
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:33,726
Who?

527
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:34,894
The Jews.

528
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,441
You know any Jews?

529
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:41,363
See...

530
00:31:41,995 --> 00:31:43,360
I recruit skins.

531
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,785
They don't know no more than you do.

532
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:48,370
And I have to teach them
that we have a...

533
00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:51,619
A moral obligation to get rid
of the Jews. See, it was in the bible.

534
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:53,204
Where?

535
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,563
In the beginning.

536
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:56,833
It's part of creation.

537
00:31:57,452 --> 00:31:59,052
See, in the beginning,

538
00:31:59,754 --> 00:32:01,804
right, you had your mud people.

539
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:05,130
Now, they were also referred
to as beasts because they had no souls.

540
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:06,736
See, they were soulless.

541
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,637
And then Cain...
You remember him, now?

542
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:13,700
He laid down with the mud people,

543
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:16,775
and out of these fornications
came the edomites.

544
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,564
Do you know who they are?

545
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:21,024
Who?

546
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:23,526
- They're the jews.
- You're serious?

547
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,719
Read your bible
as interpreted by experts.

548
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,480
You know, Boyd,

549
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,954
I think you just use the bible
to do whatever the hell you like.

550
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,873
What do you think I like, Raylan?

551
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:39,292
You like to get money
and blow shit up.

552
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:43,478
I know about your friend Devil
and his record selling dope.

553
00:32:43,603 --> 00:32:45,251
And I'm willing to bet

554
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,435
that you blew up
that church in Lexington

555
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,878
not because it was black,
because it was a dope store.

556
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:53,015
10 to 1 says you got paid to do it
by some other dope dealer around

557
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,144
who didn't like the idea of the preacher
getting a free pass from the police.

558
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,645
Win-win for you, wasn't it, Boyd?

559
00:33:00,306 --> 00:33:02,982
Not only did you get to blow something
to smithereens, you got money.

560
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:06,630
See, I'm giving you the benefit

561
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:08,588
you aren't mental.

562
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:11,699
I know you're not stupid enough
to believe that mud-people story.

563
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,118
You think you know me?

564
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:17,541
I know you,
deputy marshal Raylan Givens.

565
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:20,284
I know you like to shoot bad people.

566
00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:23,833
I heard about that gun thug
you shot in a hotel

567
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,839
in Miami.
You heard about that?

568
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:28,550
We have TVs down here now, Raylan.

569
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:32,601
But, you know,

570
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:35,642
at any point,

571
00:33:36,962 --> 00:33:39,561
when you were looking at
that gun thug,

572
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:41,938
did you see your daddy's face?

573
00:33:47,311 --> 00:33:48,797
The reason I'm here...

574
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:51,322
We're having a little lineup
tomorrow at the courthouse.

575
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,030
What did I do now?

576
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:55,456
Listen, we got a witness

577
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:58,281
who saw a man fire a bazooka
into a church.

578
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:01,913
And I'd appreciate it
if you'd be in that lineup.

579
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:03,960
- I bet you would.
- You either show up,

580
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,728
or we'll come get you.

581
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:09,049
Let me ask you a question.

582
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:11,634
Would you shoot me

583
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:13,553
if you get the chance?

584
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,638
You make me pull, I'll put you down.

585
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:33,031
Reverend, what do you think?

586
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:37,369
I don't know. You know, it was dark,
and the man was far away.

587
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,902
And if you heard anybody,
you know, shoot a rocket at you,

588
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:42,885
you don't stand there and look,
you know, I just run.

589
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:47,985
Cut them loose.

590
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,674
I did my part.
I showed up.

591
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:56,805
The idea of walking in past a gathering
of law enforcement appealed to you,

592
00:34:57,565 --> 00:35:00,778
especially since you knew that preacher
didn't have the balls to pick you.

593
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:02,894
It's always good to see you.

594
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,020
You know that man
you shot in Florida?

595
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:12,089
My boy Dewey's cousin down there...
He said he heard a rumor

596
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:15,109
that you gave that gun thug
24 hours to get out of town

597
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,474
or you'd shoot him on sight.

598
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:19,536
Is that true?

599
00:35:19,863 --> 00:35:22,995
I gave him the option to leave Miami.
He turned it down.

600
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,126
What would you say
if I made you the same offer?

601
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:29,071
You get out of Harlan county
by tomorrow noon,

602
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:30,797
or I'm gonna come looking for you.

603
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,799
Does that sound fair?

604
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,412
Now you're talking.

605
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:56,985
My lawyer's talking
to the prosecutor.

606
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,093
Come with me while I smoke.

607
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:11,762
I plead to manslaughter,
and I won't have to go to prison,

608
00:36:12,096 --> 00:36:15,231
though if I have to, I have to.
It was worth it.

609
00:36:17,303 --> 00:36:19,236
Why don't you come by for supper?

610
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:21,181
I'll pick up a couple of fryers,

611
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,304
fix you some hot biscuits and gravy.

612
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,729
Look at you licking your lips.

613
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:31,038
All my life,
fried chicken's been my favorite.

614
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:32,525
But I shouldn't.

615
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:33,735
Why not?

616
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:35,726
Because...

617
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,890
an officer of the law
isn't supposed to be

618
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,949
socializing with the defendant
in a murder investigation.

619
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,290
I didn't know that.

620
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:49,498
It's sort of frowned upon.

621
00:36:52,922 --> 00:36:54,472
I'm fixing it anyway.

622
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:55,802
You're a big boy.

623
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:59,377
You want to come,
there's nothing on earth gonna stop you.

624
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,264
If it weren't for Boyd,
I'd have me some of Ava.

625
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:07,019
Wasn't for Boyd,
me and you could have us the marshal.

626
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:09,979
So, what did Boyd say exactly...

627
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,524
"He's coming for you"
or "we're coming"?

628
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:14,252
He said he was.

629
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:18,238
But we don't know whether he wants
to shoot you or blow you up, do we?

630
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:20,819
Then again,
he could just jump the gun

631
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:23,451
and come after you
when you aren't looking.

632
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:26,871
If I was you, I'd look under the car
before I turned the key every time.

633
00:37:29,004 --> 00:37:31,376
We're like big-game hunters,

634
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:34,232
except that you're the bait.

635
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,924
You're kind of like the goat
tethered to the pole.

636
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:40,260
And all I got to do
is keep you in sight.

637
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,929
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

638
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:15,395
He's at the motel with his friends.

639
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,338
Well, do you see our friends?

640
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:20,633
I do.

641
00:38:22,137 --> 00:38:24,179
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

642
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:26,556
Sit tight.

643
00:38:44,492 --> 00:38:46,092
You expecting someone?

644
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:49,719
Give me them things.

645
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:56,978
What are they doing out there?

646
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:59,380
You folks are missing
a hell of a show.

647
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,884
I think Rachel's trying
to shoot the moon.

648
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:05,136
I don't try, I do, and you weep.

649
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:07,335
One single, solitary tear.

650
00:39:18,124 --> 00:39:18,959
Hello?

651
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:20,937
Can you smell the chicken frying?

652
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:25,405
It'll be done
by the time you get here.

653
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,119
I'm on my way.

654
00:39:35,594 --> 00:39:36,876
Boyd's at Ava's.

655
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:37,961
You sure?

656
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,558
I'm not saying
there was a gun to her head,

657
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:42,132
but she didn't sound right.

658
00:39:57,274 --> 00:39:58,231
Let's hit it.

659
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:05,780
Call Raylan.
Tell him to keep the line open.

660
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:24,509
- Where do you want me?
- Keep going. Get Ava. We got this.

661
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:25,592
You got this?

662
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:27,427
Go!

663
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,224
You get around.

664
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:03,131
You want me to kill them
or wing them?

665
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:05,334
Let's start with winging.

666
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:17,200
- You okay?
- I got hit.

667
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,829
- Can you shoot?
- I think so.

668
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:21,904
Then let's finish this thing.

669
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:25,645
Please, either one of you,

670
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:28,184
do something stupid.

671
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:48,023
- What are you d... he'll see us.
- He's already seen us, you moron.

672
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:50,218
You want we should wrap
ourselves around a tree?

673
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:51,834
Christ almighty.

674
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,724
What the hell's he doing?

675
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:58,768
He must be sneaking up on the house.

676
00:41:59,296 --> 00:42:00,575
No, he ain't.

677
00:42:10,955 --> 00:42:12,055
So, tell me.

678
00:42:12,244 --> 00:42:13,544
What's going on?

679
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:19,590
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you guys.

680
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:22,542
There ain't nothing going on, all right?
We's just out riding around.

681
00:42:25,722 --> 00:42:26,674
All right.

682
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:28,715
Boyd just wants to have
a word with you.

683
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:30,049
He wants to shoot me.

684
00:42:30,324 --> 00:42:32,093
Then what are you asking us for,
asshole?

685
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:35,847
Outlaw life's hard, ain't it?

686
00:42:36,015 --> 00:42:40,019
Cuff your left hand, put it through
the steering wheel, and cuff gator boy.

687
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:43,711
Give me your hand, stupid.

688
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,051
You don't need to say anything.

689
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:52,197
I swear to God,
I didn't know he was coming.

690
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:53,729
I believe you.

691
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,952
No shotguns allowed
in this dining room.

692
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:01,456
Toss it outside.

693
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,179
Come on.

694
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:15,760
Why don't you go in the kitchen,
maybe watch some TV or something?

695
00:43:16,687 --> 00:43:17,687
Go on.

696
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:21,613
Come on in.

697
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,903
Come on in. Sit down. Help yourself.

698
00:43:31,863 --> 00:43:33,463
The gravy ain't bad...

699
00:43:33,668 --> 00:43:36,032
I mean, it ain't like your mama
used to make it, but...

700
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,650
it never is, is it?

701
00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:40,829
Let me ask you something.

702
00:43:41,293 --> 00:43:44,332
When you shot
that gun thug in Miami,

703
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:46,668
was there food
on the table like this?

704
00:43:47,264 --> 00:43:48,264
There was.

705
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:51,557
Have something.
Have a little chicken.

706
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:53,592
And you...

707
00:43:54,544 --> 00:43:55,894
You had your gun.

708
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:58,380
- What kind was it?
- That time?

709
00:43:58,505 --> 00:43:59,798
A Sig 226.

710
00:44:00,189 --> 00:44:01,433
And where was it?

711
00:44:01,687 --> 00:44:04,144
- Was it on the table where mine is?
- It was holstered.

712
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:05,436
Bullshit.

713
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:07,188
It was holstered.

714
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,108
Where was his?

715
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:11,908
Under the table.

716
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,792
And what did he have.

717
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,328
What kind of piece, I mean?

718
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:17,981
I don't recall.

719
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,785
How did you know when to pull?

720
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:22,454
He went first.

721
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,500
And you gave this gun thug

722
00:44:24,837 --> 00:44:26,041
24 hours

723
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:27,842
to get out of town,

724
00:44:28,144 --> 00:44:31,421
and was the time up when you...
when you shot him?

725
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:33,164
Pretty close.

726
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:37,510
How much time
do you think you got left?

727
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:40,555
I thought I had till noon tomorrow.

728
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:42,935
What if I said it was right now?

729
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:46,770
I mean, unless, of course,
you want to finish that chicken leg.

730
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,277
I mean, you can call it off.

731
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:51,952
I mean, I don't mind.

732
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,539
If you're gonna keep after me,
Raylan,

733
00:44:54,664 --> 00:44:57,071
I figure we may as well
just get her done.

734
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:05,580
Your 45's on the table,
I have to pull? Is that how we do it?

735
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:07,895
I appreciate that, Raylan.

736
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,469
Yes, I do believe it is my call.

737
00:45:12,886 --> 00:45:14,255
What are you packing?

738
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:17,092
You'll pay to find that out.

739
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:21,596
You got ice-cold water
running through your veins.

740
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:26,393
Should we just do us
a shot of Jim Beam

741
00:45:26,552 --> 00:45:28,186
just for old times' sake?

742
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,107
Get us a shot of Jim...

743
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:35,392
You want to know what Bowman said

744
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:37,737
when he looked up
and he saw me with his deer rifle?

745
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:40,824
God damn, woman, you only shoot people
when they're eating supper?

746
00:45:41,028 --> 00:45:43,201
He had his mouth
full of sweet potato.

747
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:46,075
He said,
"The hell you doing with that?"

748
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:50,015
- Put the gun down, please.
- Want to know what I said?

749
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,575
I said,
"I'm gonna shoot you, dummy."

750
00:46:16,883 --> 00:46:18,278
You did it, huh?

751
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:20,320
You really did. You did it.

752
00:46:22,684 --> 00:46:23,684
I'm sorry.

753
00:46:24,605 --> 00:46:26,005
But you called it.

754
00:46:48,163 --> 00:46:50,013
Why'd you say you're sorry?

755
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,361
Boyd and I dug coal together.

756
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,966
At Glynco, didn't you teach
those recruits to aim for the heart?

757
00:47:49,777 --> 00:47:52,327
Toilet's broken.
Use the one downstairs.

758
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:02,553
Just hold up here.
You leave the door open?

759
00:48:02,678 --> 00:48:05,128
No, I did not leave the door open.

760
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:07,313
Somebody did. It wasn't me.

761
00:48:15,717 --> 00:48:16,997
Jesus Christ!

762
00:48:17,966 --> 00:48:19,066
Hello, Gary.

763
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:27,031
You almost gave him a heart attack.

764
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:28,754
Sorry about that.

765
00:48:28,879 --> 00:48:30,555
I told him
if you were gonna shoot him,

766
00:48:30,698 --> 00:48:33,798
you would've done it six years ago
when I left you.

767
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:37,876
What are you doing here, Raylan?

768
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,864
I'm gonna be working in Kentucky,

769
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:45,139
working for the marshal's office.

770
00:48:47,632 --> 00:48:49,512
What are you doing here?

771
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:02,716
I was in Nicaragua a while back,

772
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:05,343
looking for this...

773
00:49:06,145 --> 00:49:08,345
money launderer named Roland Pike.

774
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:12,482
The cartel's gun thug, Tommy Bucks,
was looking for him, too.

775
00:49:12,704 --> 00:49:13,704
Bucks...

776
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:17,386
got me, took my gun,
put me in a car with some other man,

777
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,675
drove us to some
old coconut plantation.

778
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:23,832
Then he tied the man to a palm tree

779
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,193
and asked me where Roland was.

780
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:31,352
I told him what I knew...
No sense in lying.

781
00:49:32,632 --> 00:49:33,747
I guess

782
00:49:34,393 --> 00:49:36,252
he wasn't certain
he could believe me

783
00:49:36,377 --> 00:49:37,837
and needed to be sure,

784
00:49:37,962 --> 00:49:41,312
or he just wanted to impress upon me
how serious he was.

785
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,766
But I watched as Tommy Bucks

786
00:49:43,891 --> 00:49:46,661
stuck a stick of dynamite
in that poor man's mouth,

787
00:49:46,786 --> 00:49:49,076
taped it so he couldn't spit it out,

788
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:50,198
and lit the fuse.

789
00:49:54,078 --> 00:49:56,878
The next time I saw Tommy Bucks
was in Miami.

790
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:01,334
I told him he's got 24 hours to get
out of town, or I'm gonna kill him.

791
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,860
Did you?

792
00:50:07,242 --> 00:50:10,119
But he pulled first,
so I was justified.

793
00:50:12,473 --> 00:50:13,972
But what troubles me

794
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:17,255
is what if he hadn't?

795
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:19,896
What if he just sat there

796
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:21,821
and let the clock run out?

797
00:50:22,642 --> 00:50:24,941
Would I have killed him anyway?

798
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,403
I know I wanted to.

799
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,326
Guess I just never thought of myself
as an angry man.

800
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,970
You do a good job of hiding it,
and I...

801
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:49,601
I suppose most folks don't see it,
but, honestly,

802
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:53,059
you're the angriest man
I have ever known.
