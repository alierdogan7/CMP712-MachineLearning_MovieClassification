1
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,312
The French have said
au revoir to the franc.

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,399
The Germans have said
auf wiedersehen to the Deutschmark.

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,529
And the Portuguese have said
whatever to their thing.

4
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:29,613
Go!

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,741
Now it's our turn to say
goodbye to Sterling.

6
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,246
This Christmas
we are going to get the euro.

7
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,122
Goodbye old pound.

8
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,916
Everyone says
we are going to miss you.

9
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,835
- Come on!
- Faster! Faster!

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,628
- Hey come on!
- Faster!

11
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,008
I can't see ya!
Where are you?

12
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,010
I'm over here!

13
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,721
This is the main drag along here.

14
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,807
That's Portland.

15
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:01,603
Bisecting that at right angles,
is Lundy on that side.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,649
On this side there's Fastnet.
What's yours?

17
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,025
Cromarty.

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,236
Cromarty and German Bight.

19
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,822
Cul de sacs. Over here.

20
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,118
- I've come through.
- Come on! Come on, Damian!

21
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,662
There's a train coming!

22
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,127
Keep pedalling. Come on!

23
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,839
Faster!

24
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,635
- Beat ya!
- Come on!

25
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,018
I'm gonna call it Serendipity.

26
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,520
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,315
- Anyway it's number twenty.
- Upstairs!

28
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,526
- This is my room.
- And mine.

29
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,321
Get your own room.

30
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,546
The patron saint of
house removals is Saint Anne.

31
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,131
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that, no.

32
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,843
Yeah, she lived in
the desert, obviously.

33
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,553
And when she wanted to move house.

34
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,430
Angels came, picked up her house
and took it to Italy.

35
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,849
Handy.

36
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,817
She was Our Lady's mother.

37
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,110
What you on about Damian?

38
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,736
Saint Anne. I've got a picture.

39
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,531
Look. I don't care, just get
in the car, will ya? We're going'.

40
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,741
Go on! Get in the car!

41
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,038
- Was she in it at the time?
- Who?

42
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,833
Saint Anne.
When the angels did the...

43
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,043
you know the airlift?

44
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,545
I don't know.

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,292
Start with the money.

46
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,419
That's what our Anthony says.

47
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,796
That's what people
want to know about.

48
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,632
Like if you're moving house...

49
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,302
you don't say "we're moving house
and the new one has got a green door".

50
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,137
You say how much you're paying.

51
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,515
How much you got for the old one.

52
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:29,728
Mortgage. Interest rates.
Stamp duty. Solicitor's fees.

53
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,731
How much you'll get
if the new one goes up in value.

54
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,233
That's called equity.

55
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,235
Personally, I think, 'so what? '

56
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,736
Money's just a thing.

57
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,154
And things change.

58
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,241
One minute something's there
and you can cuddle up to it.

59
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,117
The next minute it's gone.

60
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,994
Like a Malteser.

61
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,538
That goes in the kitchen.

62
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,832
Is this fantastic or what?

63
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,709
Surprisingly spacious,
with attractive views.

64
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,127
Oh, that's Anthony's.
That must go upstairs and...

65
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,004
And anyway, in the end,

66
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,341
it turns out it wasn't about
the money after all.

67
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,636
That's it lads.
Up to the main bedroom.

68
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,721
Has anyone seen
where the phone points are?

69
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,725
Eh, where do I plug this in?

70
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,854
Oh, right, yeah.
Oh that looks good, that does.

71
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,403
Right

72
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,865
this is what
we're having' tonight, yeah?

73
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,742
Before Countdown,
put the oven on.

74
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,911
After Countdown,
get a packet of these,

75
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,245
put them in there
with some oven chips, yeah?

76
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,121
It's for mum.

77
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,040
The time is on here, yeah.

78
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:13,749
Ok.

79
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,042
That's how long
they have to stay in.

80
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,628
By the time they're ready,
I'll be back.

81
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,048
She may already have
won ten thousand pounds.

82
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,300
Her name has been entered in a draw.

83
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,511
- All she has to do is...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,137
Thank you.

85
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,305
Hands?

86
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,224
Other sides.

87
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,521
Let's go.

88
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,730
Come on!

89
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,024
That's you.

90
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,943
Get your bags.

91
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,320
And your book bag, Damian.
Keyssss...

92
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,247
Now remember
it's no good being clever,

93
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,623
you've got to be
the cleverest, yeah?

94
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,333
- Alright. See ya Dad.
- Good luck lads.

95
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,293
See ya.
Are you nervous?

96
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,419
A bit.

97
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,512
So everybody sitting up nicely?
Excellent.

98
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,931
Now we are talking, today,
about people we admire.

99
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,642
- Dminic?
- Roy Keane, Sir, Manchester United.

100
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,143
Very good, Roy Keane.

101
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:15,936
What about you Barry?

102
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,146
- Van Nistelrooy, sir.
- Van Nistelrooy, right.

103
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:21,024
Anyone got any heroes
who don't play for United?

104
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,318
- Jack?
- Robbie Fowler, Sir, City.

105
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,446
Alright, that's enough.

106
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,531
Tricia?

107
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,908
I don't know any footballers, sir.

108
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,326
Well, it doesn't have
to be a footballer,

109
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,328
it could be... anyone.

110
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,998
- Don't know sir.
- No?

111
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,416
Damian?

112
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,834
Saint Roch, sir.

113
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,420
- Who's he play for?
- No one sir, he's a Saint.

114
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,338
Oh that's better, go on.

115
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,842
He was so worried that
he might say something bad.

116
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,511
That he said nothing
at all for twenty years.

117
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,055
We could do with a couple
like him in this class.

118
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:52,931
Thank you, Damian.

119
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,434
I like a lot of virgin martyrs too.

120
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,060
Like Saint Agatha.

121
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,437
She ripped her own eyes out,

122
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,856
so she wouldn't have
to marry this man.

123
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,193
Or Saint Katherine of Alexandria.

124
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,321
They tried to kill her by crushing
her to death on a wheel.

125
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,323
But she made the wheel explode

126
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,534
and all the splinters
killed people in the crowd.

127
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,120
The patron Saint of fireworks.

128
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,039
That's where we get
the Catherine wheel from.

129
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,208
I did say thank you, Damian.

130
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,211
Right, I brought in this picture.

131
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,839
This is a hero of mine.
Who knows who this is?

132
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,635
- Nelson Mandela?
- Fantastic, Nelson Mandela.

133
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,734
I should be careful
what you talk about.

134
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,111
Try talking about football
or something.

135
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,906
Keep off the weird stuff.

136
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,034
Just don't be conspicuous
or you won't fit in.

137
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,234
Aero and a Yorkie please.
And five juicy lips.

138
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,946
Haven't seen you two here, before.

139
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,739
We just moved here.

140
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,324
Our mam's dead.

141
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,829
Yeah, well go on, you're alright.

142
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,038
- Thanks.
- God bless.

143
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:40,956
Who's next?

144
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:41,748
Works every time.

145
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,127
You tell them your mam's dead
and they give you stuff, every time.

146
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,807
I'm your... Community Policeman.

147
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,810
Obviously there is
no community here as yet,

148
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,855
not to speak of, but you know...

149
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,358
Anyway the first thing to say is,

150
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,820
these new houses
and Christmas coming up.

151
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,948
Statistically
you're going to get burgled.

152
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,619
Now, not all of you, but some of you, soon.

153
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,705
Probably this week, next.

154
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,334
When you are, call me.

155
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,129
I'll give you a crime number

156
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:34,134
and then you can make a claim
on your insurance.

157
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,931
Building maintenance?

158
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,516
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

159
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,435
Yeah, I'm usually right,
it's a knack.

160
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,940
Do you mind me asking?
Is the kettle actually on? I'm...

161
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,358
Oh, sorry.

162
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:50,609
Yes?

163
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:54,029
Isn't the problem here,
that our houses are built on sand?

164
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,906
Sand? No.

165
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,407
They're not are they?

166
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,119
If you store up your treasure
on earth it will be stolen.

167
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,623
But if you give it away,
then it can't be stolen.

168
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,834
Mormons?

169
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,419
Well, Latter Day Saints.

170
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,712
Saints?

171
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,713
I know all about them...

172
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,714
Errr... Damian,

173
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,633
go and give Terry a hand
in the kitchen will you?

174
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,052
You too Anthony,
off you go, good lads.

175
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,348
Now, some of you are
going to be burgled.

176
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,517
There are things I can tell you,

177
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,811
that will lower the odds
of it being you personally.

178
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,312
It's a bit anti-social,

179
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,605
because if it isn't
you then it'll be next door,

180
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,607
but ha-ha there you go.

181
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,902
Our mam's dead.

182
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,828
Here. Go on, help yourself.

183
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,540
Take as many as you like, son.

184
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,015
Result.

185
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,435
Is it completely honest?

186
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,230
Completely dead isn't she?

187
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,144
What?

188
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,233
What do you want?

189
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,320
Can't you see I'm busy?

190
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,738
Just go away.

191
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,342
I don't like having my own room.

192
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:06,638
Clare of Assisi,

193
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,558
Eleven Ninety Four till
Twelve Fifty Three?

194
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,601
That's right.

195
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,023
I used to have a hermitage,
myself, once.

196
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,031
I used to go and hide up there.

197
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:27,409
If anyone needed me,
I'd send them a vision, sort them out.

198
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,037
That's why I'm the patron
saint of television.

199
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:33,248
I was like... human television.

200
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,834
You're the patron saint
of television?

201
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,960
Keeps me busy.

202
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,045
You know?

203
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,258
Are you allowed to smoke then?

204
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,427
You can do what you
like up there, son.

205
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,639
It's down here,
you have to make the effort.

206
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,602
Do you ever come across
a Saint Maureen?

207
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,521
She hasn't been there long.

208
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,314
Don't ring a bell.

209
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:01,109
Then again,
it is infinite up there.

210
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,240
Absolutely bloody infinite.

211
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,036
Listen...

212
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:26,802
Dad.

213
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:54,997
What is it anyway?

214
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:57,624
What are you doing
with all these boxes?

215
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,130
- What's that?
- Wait and see.

216
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,725
Where did you get that?

217
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,935
You can see it too then?

218
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,061
Well... you know...

219
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,731
sometimes you see things.
Don't you?

220
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,025
And other people can't see them.

221
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:25,527
What?

222
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,323
Well... you know... sometimes,
but this is real though.

223
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,118
This is real. This is real

224
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,621
Can't wait to tell dad.

225
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,748
You can't tell dad about this.

226
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,625
You can't tell anyone about this.

227
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,918
Why not?

228
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,211
Tax.

229
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,255
If the government
find out about this,

230
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,633
they'll take forty percent
of it away.

231
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,134
Forty percent!

232
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,928
Do you know how much that is?

233
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,055
Nearly all of it.

234
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,316
Shall we count it before we go?

235
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,444
No, we can't we're really late.

236
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,035
How much? How much?

237
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,245
There's thousands.

238
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,037
Ten thousand.

239
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,914
- Fifty thousand.
- Seventy.

240
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,123
Two hundred thousand.

241
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,917
Millions even.

242
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,547
Patch... Jenga.

243
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,966
Oink. Oink. Oink. Oink.

244
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:33,804
Promise not to tell anyone.

245
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,097
What is it?

246
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:37,933
- How much is it?
- Thousands.

247
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,434
Hundreds.

248
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,103
It's just hundreds.

249
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,312
No one else knows.

250
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,524
So if anyone finds out,
we'll know it's you. Ok?

251
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,531
Anyone finds out we know it's you.

252
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,324
No one else knows.

253
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,118
Just me and you. Here.

254
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,953
Thanks.

255
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,538
Yeah, just keep it shut.

256
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,801
Two hundred and twenty nine thousand,

257
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,512
five hundred and
twenty pounds, minus...

258
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,140
a hundred quid each,
spending money.

259
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,434
Leaves two hundred
and twenty nine thousand,

260
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,810
three hundred and twenty quid.

261
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,521
And we're going to give
all that to the poor.

262
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,732
Where you going to find poor people?

263
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,650
There's loads of poor people.

264
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,737
Not round here.
The house prices keep them out.

265
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,518
Go on. Go. Go.

266
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:17,616
Go on. Go. Go. Go on.
Go. Go. Go. Go on.

267
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:18,826
Go on.

268
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,042
Francis of Assisi?

269
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,420
Eleven eighty one till
twelve twenty six.

270
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,130
You did this didn't you?

271
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,132
My first act as a Saint.

272
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,101
What was your next one?

273
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,019
Washing a leper.

274
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,229
A leper?

275
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,314
You could just help
the poor Damian.

276
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,528
Big Issue. Help the homeless.

277
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,822
Big Issue anyone?

278
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,826
Oh hello.

279
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,244
And keep the change.

280
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,330
Oh, thanks mate,
I've had nothing to eat all day.

281
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,749
Oh we're going to Pizza Hut,
want to come.

282
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,336
No... no. She doesn't.
She just wants more money.

283
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,548
- We haven't got any more.
- No I fancy pizza actually.

284
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,258
Can I bring my friend?

285
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:28,228
Meat feast, deep and juicy,
stuffed crust mate.

286
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,730
Two meat feast thin and crispy.

287
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,024
- Ah a big New Yorker.
- A combo platter.

288
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,318
- Do us a farmhouse.
- I'll have some garlic bread love.

289
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,819
We'll all have some
garlic bread won't we?

290
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:38,614
And Dippin' Chicken.
To share.

291
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:43,452
This is great. Anthony thought
there were no poor people round here.

292
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,537
Because of the house prices.

293
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,164
Well they're not from round here.

294
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,458
- Come in on the bus.
- I come in on the train.

295
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,626
Couldn't afford to
live round here.

296
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,419
Who exactly is paying
for all this?

297
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,795
We are.

298
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,298
- You must be minted!
- Yeah we are.

299
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:59,134
No... no, we're not.

300
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,302
It's birthday money.

301
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,137
His birthday money,
he saved it.

302
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,015
- Puddings?
- Yes please.

303
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,433
No.

304
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,644
One hundred and sixty eight quid.

305
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,312
Do you know how many times
we'd have to visit Pizza Hut

306
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,647
to get rid of all the money?

307
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:14,733
One thousand, three hundred and
three point five one seven times.

308
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,360
It's just not practical.

309
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,028
We should buy property.

310
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,948
See this house,
we could buy two like that.

311
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,033
If they knocked some off
the asking price.

312
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,619
And if we did buy property,
that'll go up in value.

313
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,621
So we'd have even more money.

314
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:29,623
Damian?

315
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,842
Excuse me?

316
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,219
Are you poor?

317
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,220
Beg your pardon?

318
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,847
Are you poor?

319
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,431
Are you asking for money?

320
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,058
Me? No.

321
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,018
Because we don't have any.

322
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:53,438
We live in a community,
you know, it's very basic.

323
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:57,109
We don't have a dishwasher
for instance or a microwave.

324
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,319
And there's no cash kept
on the premises.

325
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,196
So you are poor?

326
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,408
In a sense, yes.

327
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:05,826
Brilliant!

328
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,715
Invergi. Invergi

329
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,926
St. Nicholas of Myra?

330
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,345
Sanctus quartus saeculus sum...

331
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,725
Patronus de nautae et,
vero, natalis.

332
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,395
It won't all fit.

333
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:36,899
El fini errant centi cetus poplas

334
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,450
Saint Nicholas?

335
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,036
Do you ever come across
a Saint Maureen?

336
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:52,247
- Ques?
- Saint Maureen. She's new.

337
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,624
Quat facki abat?

338
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,419
Skin care. She worked on
the make-up counter at Selfridges.

339
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,046
Sel-frid-ges?

340
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,841
To betal?

341
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,220
Est a quero publican rodeo.

342
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,102
It's less than a fortnight to E-day.

343
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,021
That's when
Britain completes transition

344
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:19,149
to the European Monitory Union.
The EMU.

345
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:25,656
Oh with twelve days left to E-day,
my true love said to me.

346
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:31,328
The transitional exchange rate
is fixed at sixty seven p.

347
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:36,041
Oh! Well all I can say is...
ding dong

348
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,212
After E-day your old money
will no longer be legal tender.

349
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:42,923
Wish pounds goodbye and euros...

350
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,716
Hello.

351
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,240
We don't have to queue up.

352
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,828
Here we go.

353
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,333
How much have you actually got?

354
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:00,542
Plenty.

355
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,844
- Anthony Cunningham.
- Where's your dad?

356
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,846
My dad? Well he's not coming.

357
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:13,931
Eh?

358
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,225
Yeah, he's not coming yet.
He said to start without him.

359
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:17,809
Start what without him?

360
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:19,436
The job is to show him
around the apartment.

361
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,730
How can I do that,
if he isn't here?

362
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,106
He gave me this.

363
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,401
Show me around and
I'll fill him in afterwards.

364
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,403
It's what we usually do.

365
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:34,117
We're looking at this for our
investment portfolio.

366
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,744
Not as a residence.

367
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,246
Has it kept it's value?

368
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,414
It's gone up twenty percent
in the last two years,

369
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,041
because of the schools.

370
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,835
He does send you to school doesn't he?

371
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,128
Or do you just
look at photos of them?

372
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,801
Flood lights. Scoreboards. Stadium.

373
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:55,097
It's the dogs bollocks this,
family heirloom. Fifty quid?

374
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:56,306
Fifty quid?

375
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,433
You could buy
a proper football team for that.

376
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,519
I could buy Crewe Alexander for that.

377
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:04,231
Yeah but...
this has got managers.

378
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,441
Dan Leavy and Malcolm Allinson

379
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,110
Never heard of him.

380
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,319
Deal.

381
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,533
You said you would for five quid.

382
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,743
I didn't know you were going
to get five quid did I?

383
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,453
Ten quid then?

384
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,622
Look, I've got a good body.

385
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,293
Twenty quid, last offer.

386
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,523
Martyrs of Uganda,
eighteen eighty one?

387
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,941
That's right.

388
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,820
Ohhhh sorry about that.

389
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,657
I was beheaded. See.

390
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:59,119
Before that I was in construction.

391
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,915
I don't know who built this,
but they were a right cowboy.

392
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,917
I built it myself.

393
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,836
Well, you'll see what we can do.

394
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,505
But I can't promise anything.

395
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,507
Why not?
There's plenty of you.

396
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:15,135
Yes, come on welcome.

397
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,520
Hello.

398
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,529
What are they singing?

399
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,410
They are praying for rain.

400
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,413
Where I come from...

401
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:47,334
people have to pay a tenth
of their daily income on water.

402
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:52,214
It's so expensive that they can't
afford to wash their hands.

403
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,216
So they get disease.

404
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,929
You don't need fancy hospitals
or medicines to make life better,

405
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,640
just a well.
And you...

406
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:05,310
can build a well for as
little as one hundred pounds.

407
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:08,313
That's fantastic!
Thanks.

408
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,914
I'm sorry I don't know who you are.

409
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,916
Mutual that then.

410
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:31,420
This yours?

411
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:34,756
Nice.

412
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:38,802
Near a railway.

413
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:52,107
- What's in there?
- Nothing really.

414
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:04,745
- What's this?
- A dress. It was my mums.

415
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,299
What are you looking for?

416
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,013
Money.

417
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,724
Are you poor?

418
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:27,643
What?

419
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,228
Damian, come in.

420
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,646
Anthony to Damian...

421
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:31,313
What's that?

422
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,148
- Damian, where are you?
- My brother I've got to go.

423
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:36,026
I'll come back. I've got loads.
Just wait there.

424
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,738
- Loads of what?
- Money. Just wait there.

425
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:43,617
Five... four...
three... two...

426
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,203
Who's that?

427
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,831
A poor person and
you said there weren't any.

428
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,707
I know. But who is it?

429
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,335
I don't know. Just someone.

430
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,337
What do you mean 'someone'?

431
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,130
Did he do anything to you?

432
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,926
- What sort of things?
- Never mind.

433
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:04,638
Look people are weird.
You've got to be more careful.

434
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,431
You shouldn't really talk to them.

435
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:07,933
Anyway I've told him now.

436
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:11,228
- Told him what?
- That we have tons of money.

437
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,021
He's poor.

438
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,440
What?

439
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,906
Nothing. Nothing.
Leave it to me.

440
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:32,708
Where is he then?

441
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,544
I don't know.
He was here a minute ago.

442
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,641
See.

443
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:54,021
Loads of money.
We've been saving it up for ages.

444
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,316
You can have it if you need it.

445
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,903
Come on Damian.

446
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,114
You'll have to change it quickly.

447
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,418
Do you think that was really enough?

448
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:17,836
More than enough.

449
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,756
That's him completely sorted out.

450
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,301
Right. Have you given money
to anyone else?

451
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:25,719
Not really.

452
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:49,535
What?

453
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,541
It wasn't that much.

454
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,292
Just like a bagful.

455
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:05,133
- What's that?
- Scuba scooter.

456
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:08,011
It goes at ten mile an hour
for up to five hours.

457
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:11,223
We could have one of them.
We could have one each.

458
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,433
We could have a whole fleet.

459
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,435
She's nice.

460
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,021
Huh! I've seen better.
Close the door.

461
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,867
Look you can see it protruding.

462
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,494
- What is it?
- It's a nipple.

463
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:33,996
What's it for?

464
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:37,708
Well it's for feeding babies.

465
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,127
Did mum have one?

466
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,129
Two. They've all got two.

467
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,006
And did she feed us with them?

468
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,341
Yeah, course she did. I remember.

469
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,011
You can't remember
when you were a baby.

470
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:52,723
I don't remember her doing it to me.
I remember her doing it to you.

471
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,435
Anthony?

472
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,149
What?

473
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,400
I thought you'd done the washing up?

474
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:04,693
I did it!

475
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,403
What do you call that glob?

476
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,342
Hello what's your name?

477
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:29,635
Keegan.

478
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,554
Alright, K, what's happened
to your finger?

479
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:36,558
That's quality.
Pure scary, pure scary.

480
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,521
Hey, give me your money.
Come on, empty your pockets.

481
00:33:40,646 --> 00:33:43,815
Hey you! Excuse me, excuse me!

482
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:46,818
Give me all your money.
Come on, every copper.

483
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:53,742
Who feels sorry
for poor children?

484
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,744
Correct answer.

485
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:58,247
Everybody sitting up nicely?

486
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,542
Ok. So, as you know,

487
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,836
we're going to have
new money in the New Year.

488
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:08,632
Does anybody know how much
a euro is worth in pounds?

489
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:10,425
Yes.

490
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,512
- Sixty seven p.
- Spot on.

491
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,222
Here, there's
a little prize for you.

492
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:17,099
It's your own euro converter.

493
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:19,518
Now! Who else wants one?
Anybody?

494
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,020
- Me!
- Ohh. Everybody. Ok.

495
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:26,733
So, who can tell me how much
two pence is worth in euros?

496
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,947
Mmm. Well I'll tell you.

497
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:36,618
It's worth not very much.
Almost nothing.

498
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,120
To you.

499
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:41,039
But if we all put our
two pences together.

500
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:43,292
Then we'll have a lot
of two pences won't we?

501
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,793
Yes.

502
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,712
How many people are there here?

503
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:51,800
One... two... three... four...

504
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:55,637
Five... six... seven... eight...

505
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,514
Two hundred and fifty.

506
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:58,307
Sorry?

507
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,225
There's two hundred
and fifty in the school.

508
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,519
Oh clever clogs head master.

509
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,021
Ok two hundred and fifty.

510
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:09,735
So if you each gave me two pence,
then I'd have five pounds.

511
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,361
It's not that much here.

512
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:15,532
But in Ethiopia five pounds
could feed a family for a week.

513
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:19,411
And if you all gave me two two pences,
then we'd have a tenner.

514
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,413
And that's enough
to provide that village

515
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:24,333
with a source
of clean water forever.

516
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,503
It's no good to you.
So chuck it in the bin.

517
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,507
Excuse me.
Give me all your money!

518
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:33,342
Come on, every copper.

519
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:37,638
Get out of my way. Hey you!

520
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:39,848
Hey, give me your money!

521
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,017
Come on. Empty your pockets.

522
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,940
Hello, what's your name?

523
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:48,941
Damian.

524
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,901
Hi Damian. I'm the Bin.

525
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:52,194
Hello Bin.

526
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:55,030
Damian, you'll give me
some money won't you?

527
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:01,537
Yeah.

528
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:18,428
What did you do?

529
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:19,721
You did it again didn't you?

530
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:20,931
What?

531
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,558
I saw what you did.

532
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:23,517
How much?

533
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:26,019
Not much. She's nice.

534
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,187
I've been thinking.

535
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,814
Why don't we give the money to her?

536
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,232
So how did it go?

537
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:31,400
Well...

538
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,611
A thousand!

539
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,406
What did you bring
a thousand to school for?

540
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:38,907
Can't you see
that that's suspicious?

541
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:42,536
It's not suspicious.
It's unusual.

542
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:45,914
How can it be suspicious?
It's our money.

543
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,251
Right you lot outside...
come on.

544
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,836
Right, that's enough
messing around.

545
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:51,962
Do you know in Africa

546
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:55,048
you can build a well for
as little as a hundred pounds.

547
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,509
Just listen.

548
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,727
It was the most daring,
most brilliant,

549
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:10,439
cleverest and biggest robbery
on record, ever.

550
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,024
The train was here.

551
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:16,737
The train,
the one with the money,

552
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,030
Used notes.

553
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,825
Right the van comes up
onto the platform... here.

554
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:25,829
It's a railway van
so no one takes any notice.

555
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:27,831
Until...

556
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:40,010
They jump out of this van

557
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:41,929
and some of them got hold
of the driver.

558
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,931
Some of them start shifting the money.

559
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,935
By this time rapid response
has been mobilised.

560
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:53,815
Alright, let's go. Come on!

561
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:10,916
The van drives off with
a reckless disregard for life.

562
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,918
Rapid response goes after it.

563
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:16,129
There's... armed units.
Dog handlers. Helicopters.

564
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:17,923
Throw everything at them.

565
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:19,925
The train stays here.

566
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:23,428
An ambulance comes,
takes the driver to hospital.

567
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,930
Get another driver.

568
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:28,725
The CID count the bags.
There's only one missing.

569
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:31,353
Then rapid response corner the van.

570
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:40,320
Trapped.

571
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:43,198
The robbers dropped
the lot and they leg it!

572
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:46,618
They've got no chance, except...

573
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:50,831
Newcastle United versus Arsenal
at Highbury.

574
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:54,626
One all. Disappointing result
for the gunners.

575
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,713
Please advise car,
I think we've lost them.

576
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,215
They don't catch the men.

577
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:03,635
But that's alright
because when they get back to the van...

578
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:06,847
there's the missing bag.

579
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:08,849
How do you...
how do you know all that?

580
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:10,601
His uncle works for the police.

581
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:11,894
The van has gone.

582
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,604
The train is in the station.

583
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,398
And the cops are
in the cop shop making tea.

584
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:18,233
Where are the robbers?

585
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:22,821
Where's the last place
you're going to look?

586
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,324
- Our house?
- Maybe.

587
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:29,411
So the train moves off
with a new driver and all the money.

588
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:30,746
On the train.

589
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,332
The money was on the train
and so was a robber?

590
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,042
Lateral thinking.

591
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,132
The money stays on the train,
but so does a robber.

592
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:03,737
He sits tight.

593
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:06,323
And every time the train
comes to a slow bend

594
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,450
he chucks a sack of money out.

595
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,453
They've got people waiting
all over the country.

596
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,956
Could be Stafford or Crewe.

597
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:16,542
Could be Preston or Wigan.

598
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,293
Runcorn, it could be.

599
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:20,420
Could be here.

600
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:55,289
Damian.

601
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:58,834
Damian. Calm down.
It'll be alright.

602
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,127
No one knows it was us.

603
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:03,630
I don't care. Leave me alone.
What you have to tell me for?

604
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,216
Because I wanted you to know
the truth.

605
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:08,135
We have to give it back.

606
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,637
No... no we can't do that.

607
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,014
They were going to burn it.

608
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:15,642
Now come on, it isn't the money's
fault it got stolen.

609
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:19,146
- I thought it was from God.
- What?

610
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,940
Well you know sometimes
you tell people about mam

611
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:24,193
and they give you money
or sweets.

612
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,819
Well I told God and...

613
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,530
well who else would have
that kind of money?

614
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,699
Well... in a funny...

615
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:35,120
God doesn't rob banks, alright.
God does not rob banks.

616
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:43,420
Office. Now.

617
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,131
Your father's on his way.

618
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:55,432
Come in.

619
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:01,230
The Mormons!

620
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,900
You stole money from mormons?

621
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:08,320
Would you like to tell
us why you did it Anthony?

622
00:42:17,496 --> 00:42:19,832
Our mam's dead.

623
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:30,551
Hey. Hey. Hey Anthony come here.
Anthony, Damian, come here.

624
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,557
Ok. Team talk.

625
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,352
Your mother,

626
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:43,772
She would not want you,

627
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:47,442
to stand around crying
or to steal things.

628
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,072
She wants you to get on
with your lives

629
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:53,699
and do the best you can.

630
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:55,659
Make her proud, son, eh?

631
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:01,081
And not, you know... cry.

632
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:07,754
Ok. So let's stop crying eh?

633
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,882
And stealing things.
Let's stop that too.

634
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,175
Get in the car.

635
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:21,059
Don't ever do that to me again.

636
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:23,687
Look. I'm really sorry
it was me.

637
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:26,857
I didn't mean to cause
any trouble or anything.

638
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:30,194
No you did right.
They stole it, what could you do?

639
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,280
They did give it to a good cause.

640
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:35,491
I wouldn't have done
that at their age.

641
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:39,369
They must be...
you did a good job.

642
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:42,247
Thanks.

643
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:48,545
Are you from the social?

644
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:51,048
No. I'm just a visitor.

645
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:53,550
I go round the schools
collecting for this water thing.

646
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:55,969
And try and tell them about
the change over, you know.

647
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:57,888
Making sure that
the kids understand it.

648
00:43:58,013 --> 00:43:59,681
Does anyone understand it?

649
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:02,267
Sometimes they are a bit confused,
until I talk to them.

650
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:03,560
And then...

651
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,687
They're really confused.

652
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:12,736
I'm sorry.
They're very sorry.

653
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:14,238
I've sent them to bed.

654
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:16,657
I want you to know that
it won't happen again.

655
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,243
Do you mind me asking
how you came to have

656
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,161
so much cash in the house?

657
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:25,082
It was a donation.
It was left here anonymously.

658
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:27,459
And you weren't suspicious
about that?

659
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:30,170
No, we pray a lot and

660
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:32,172
we thought it was
the answers to our prayers.

661
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,883
Only it has been mentioned
that you spent close

662
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,969
to five thousand pounds in Comet...

663
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:38,595
A few days ago.

664
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:44,059
Digital television.
Mircowave oven.

665
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:49,147
Dishwasher. Foot spa.

666
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:53,569
Did you actually pray for
all of these things?

667
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:58,574
We were praying for comfort
and encouragement.

668
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,577
I think we felt comforted
and encouraged.

669
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:03,162
By the foot spa?

670
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,372
And the dishwasher.

671
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:12,963
Samaritans. Oxfam.

672
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:14,882
Christian Aid.

673
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:17,551
For Christ's sake,
don't tick them little boxes.

674
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:21,054
The ones about putting you in touch
with like-minded organisations.

675
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,182
You'll be besieged man.
I'm telling you!

676
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:25,851
Saint Peter, died AD sixty four.

677
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:27,853
Alright, don't remind us.

678
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,063
The money... it's robbed.

679
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:31,482
I know.

680
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:35,986
Patron Saint of keys,
locks and general security, man.

681
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,490
Including up there.
I'm on the door.

682
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,868
Is it still alright,
if it's robbed?

683
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:47,581
Can you still do good with it
or should you give it back?

684
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:51,043
I thought it was a miracle,
but it is just robbed.

685
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,170
Damian. Listen.

686
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:58,467
One day I was
with you know who, Jesus.

687
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:03,555
And he went up into the mountains
and thousands of people followed him.

688
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:06,975
The police said five thousand,
five thousand.

689
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,269
Everybody knows this story.

690
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:10,395
Loaves and fishes.

691
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:13,857
See, I knew you'd say that.
That's what everybody says.

692
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:19,696
This yours?

693
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:22,282
It's the key to the old house.

694
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:26,745
Jointed pin tumbler
Engineering perfection.

695
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:32,251
Anyway, this kid comes up to us,
about your size,

696
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,670
His name was...
no I have forgotten.

697
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:36,547
I still see him sometimes.

698
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:39,967
Anyway he comes up
with these loaves and fishes.

699
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:41,552
Sardines.

700
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:45,264
And Jesus blesses them
and passes the plate round.

701
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:48,976
Now the first person
he passes it to, passes it on.

702
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:50,269
He doesn't take anything.

703
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:53,856
He just passes it on.
Do you know why?

704
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:57,234
Because he had a piece
of lamb hidden in his pocket.

705
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:01,238
And as he is passing the fish,
he sneaks a bit of meat out

706
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:03,240
and pretends he's taken
it off the plate.

707
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:05,159
Do you see what I'm saying?

708
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:09,163
And the next person
exactly the same story.

709
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:12,583
Every single bastard one
of them has their own food.

710
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:15,169
And every one of them
is keeping it quiet.

711
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:17,171
Looking after number one.

712
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:21,884
But as that plate went round
with the sardines on

713
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:25,971
They all got their own food
out and started to share.

714
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:29,266
And then that plate went
all the way round

715
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:30,392
And back to Jesus

716
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:32,769
and it'd still got the fish
and the loaves on it.

717
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:36,565
I think Jesus was a bit taken aback.

718
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,860
He says, 'what happened? '

719
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:42,362
And I just said 'miracle'.

720
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:45,365
And at first
I thought I'd fooled him.

721
00:47:47,493 --> 00:47:52,164
But now I see it was a miracle,
one of his best.

722
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:56,084
But this little kid
had stood up and...

723
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:59,463
Everybody there just got bigger.

724
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:05,844
Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

725
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:07,262
Not really.

726
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,350
I'm talking about you.

727
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,060
Now I'm really lost.

728
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:15,270
You're trying too hard.

729
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:19,358
That kid he wasn't planning
on doing a miracle.

730
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:22,152
He wasn't planning anything,
except lunch.

731
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,281
Something that looks like a miracle
turns out to be dead simple.

732
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:29,660
But what am I going to do
with all this?

733
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:33,580
I just want to be good.

734
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:37,459
Look I can't say too
much about this,

735
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:39,837
because of that whole
free will thing.

736
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:41,171
Right?

737
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:42,840
But...

738
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:50,472
see this key?
Keep it safe. Alright?

739
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:57,354
And I'll have a word upstairs...

740
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:02,067
See if I can get somebody
on your case more permanent.

741
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:09,700
It's three days left to e-day,
my true love said to me.

742
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:13,245
Convert your change
or donate to charity.

743
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:16,165
Huummmmm, marvellous.

744
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,333
There are just three days
left to e-day.

745
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,045
Remember the money in your bank account
has already been converted.

746
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:24,256
The easiest way to change
any cash you have

747
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:26,049
is to pay it into your account.

748
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:28,969
The Sterling becomes Euros
the moment it's paid in.

749
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:32,055
And if you don't have an account,
why not open one today?

750
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,390
Can I help you at all?

751
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:34,892
We'd like to open a bank account.

752
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:36,894
- Is your mum and dad with you?
- No.

753
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:40,063
Well I need an adult signature.
I need proof of who you are.

754
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,275
Oh we thought of that.
Leisure pass.

755
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:47,654
I'm afraid you're going to have
to ask your mum to come in.

756
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:50,073
This isn't enough.
Just ask your mum to come in.

757
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:52,159
- We can't.
- Why not?

758
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,370
Our mam's dead.

759
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:07,174
There's two free euros in here

760
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,469
And you can keep the rest
of your money in it.

761
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:12,679
It's the best I can do.

762
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:20,479
I told you.
We should have bought a house.

763
00:50:20,604 --> 00:50:24,775
Right if we can't hide it,
at least we can spend it.

764
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:32,950
- Hello.
- Now that is quality.

765
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:36,161
That is amazing.
I can see you. Can you see me?

766
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:37,454
Yeah.

767
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:39,373
Not here, on there.

768
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:40,499
Not as well.

769
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:43,669
I can see you in mine.
This is fantastic.

770
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:44,586
Anthony.

771
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:46,880
Why don't we give the money
to the lady with the bin?

772
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,883
It's not ours and
we're never going to spend it all.

773
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:51,260
She could do good with it.

774
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:54,346
We just gave her a grand and
look at the trouble it caused.

775
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:57,766
And if we gave her two hundred
we'll end up in jail.

776
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:01,353
We're on our own now Damian.
Don't let me down.

777
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:17,077
Hello.
The speaker went on the bin.

778
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,496
Your dad said he'd fix it.
So I said I'd cook for him.

779
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,790
So you get a decent meal for once.

780
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:26,336
I'm a fantastic cook.
Aren't I a fantastic cook, Damian?

781
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:28,755
The size of that school bag.

782
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:30,757
You'll give yourselves a hernia,
is that all homework?

783
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:32,050
- No.
- Yeah.

784
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:37,347
Er, costumes for the nativity play.
I suppose it is homework really.

785
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:39,850
I love a nativity play,
can I see them?

786
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:41,268
- Yeah.
- No.

787
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:45,981
It's private. Private property...
of the school.

788
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:47,149
It will spoil the surprise.

789
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:48,692
Am I going to go too?

790
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:50,777
Are you going to get
me some tickets?

791
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:52,488
Well I suppose so.

792
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:54,072
Well I didn't even know
they were in it.

793
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,575
I get told nothing
you know, nothing.

794
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:59,870
Are you going to come
and do some chopping?

795
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:02,247
It's lasagne, your favourite.

796
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,171
Where was the highwayman an,
Dick Turpin,

797
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,465
hanged in seventeen thirty nine?

798
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:14,384
- York.
- How did you know that?

799
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,762
- It's York.
- Glasgow... Carlisle...

800
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:18,055
He knows everything your dad.

801
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:19,765
- Norwich... York...
- Why don't you go on it,

802
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:22,059
you'd be great,
wouldn't he, he'd be great.

803
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:23,060
Fifty fifty please.

804
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,895
It's York!

805
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,481
You'd be a lot less frustrated
if you went on yourself.

806
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:29,066
Damian, tell him to go on.

807
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:31,068
You'd like to have a million
pounds wouldn't you?

808
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:34,738
It's not a million pounds.
It's a million euros.

809
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:36,573
That's only about...

810
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:39,368
Six hundred and
twenty three thousand,

811
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:42,162
one hundred pounds
at today's prices.

812
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:44,164
At least somebody
has been listening.

813
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,458
Told you it was York.

814
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,878
Jim, I'm so sorry
the answer is York.

815
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,259
We're supposed to go to bed
when this is finished.

816
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:56,677
Yeah right, go to bed.

817
00:52:57,803 --> 00:53:00,180
But you're supposed
to read us a story.

818
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:04,142
- I'll get off.
- I'll see you out.

819
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:05,936
I'll see you out too.

820
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,232
I know.

821
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,073
Come again soon.

822
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:20,868
- Sucker for women.
- Sucker for men.

823
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:27,291
Don't forget I want to see that
nativity play. Your dad'll forget.

824
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:28,876
Go and get your pyjamas on.

825
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:30,669
They're good lads.

826
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:33,589
Nice to have someone to talk
to once in a while, though.

827
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:38,468
Yeah. Thanks.
I had a great evening.

828
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:40,637
I know what she's after.

829
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,139
We can't leave it here.

830
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,850
We're going to have to keep
it with us...

831
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:45,976
all the time.

832
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:47,478
Fill your school bag.

833
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:50,856
And don't let it out your sight.

834
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:53,275
Guard it with your life,
whatever happens.

835
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,152
- Ok?
- Ok.

836
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,361
Damian?

837
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,656
Have you any room?

838
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,284
- Have you any room?
- No, Damian,

839
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:06,455
Damian he's tired, he's walked
here all the way from Nazareth.

840
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,790
He's tired.
He's very, very tired.

841
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:10,834
- Well...
- Tired.

842
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:13,754
The walk from Nazareth,
people did that all the time.

843
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:16,965
And he was a carpenter.
So he was very fit.

844
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,259
He wasn't tired.
He was excited.

845
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,261
His wife was going to have a baby.

846
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:22,554
They weren't expecting
to go to sleep.

847
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:28,060
Ok. You say excited.
I say tired. Let's try nervous?

848
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:30,354
Ok? Shall we start again?

849
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:53,252
Joseph the Worker,
first century, dates uncertain?

850
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:58,173
I wouldn't have said nervous.
I would have said focused.

851
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:11,687
Well, have you any room?

852
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:17,943
What did he want to bring her for?

853
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,570
You invited her.

854
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:25,450
Beginners.
Beginners positions.

855
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:26,743
Damian, come on.

856
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:40,174
The word went out
from Julius Caesar.

857
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:41,466
Caesar...

858
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:44,970
Caesar Augustus that everybody

859
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:48,098
had to go to their
home town to be taxed.

860
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,727
So Mary and Joseph
set out for Bethlehem.

861
00:55:57,107 --> 00:56:02,279
# Little Donkey,
# Little Don. Key.

862
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:05,282
# On the dusty road...

863
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:07,576
Do you know how much
a piece of gold that big

864
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:09,745
would be worth at today's prices?

865
00:56:09,912 --> 00:56:12,956
A lot. An awful lot.
I wonder what happened to it?

866
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,959
Because he was poor after that.
I wonder what he spent it on.

867
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:19,463
Can we please loose
the anachronistic bag?

868
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,466
I don't think they had Addidas
in the first century.

869
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:26,637
Far away to the East,
three wise men saw a star.

870
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,263
Thanks girls.

871
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:29,848
Look a star!

872
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:31,141
Let's follow it.

873
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:37,981
# Come, they told me,
# par um pa pa pa pum

874
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:44,446
# A new born King to see,
# par um pa pum pum

875
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,873
No, Saint Maureen.

876
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,753
I don't think I have heard of her.
Is she a virgin martyr?

877
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,338
I don't think so.

878
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:08,554
Here he is.

879
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,848
He's always got
those bags with him.

880
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:12,766
Pom pom pom...

881
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:16,687
Do you remember me?

882
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:18,856
Mmmm...?

883
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,692
I'm the poor man.

884
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,281
Damian Cunningham,
what are you doing there?

885
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:29,074
Come on, where should you be?

886
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:30,868
Where should you be,
you should be in Bethlehem,

887
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:31,869
come on.

888
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:34,454
I can't believe you've got...
no go back... go back.

889
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,248
As for these.

890
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:38,250
What have I told you about these?

891
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:39,960
I've told you before. Ssshhhhh.

892
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:42,045
Back out! Back out! Back out!

893
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:43,964
Shhhhh! Back on! Back on!

894
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:46,466
They tried first at one inn.

895
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:49,469
Do you have any room
at this inn?

896
00:57:49,595 --> 00:57:51,763
No sorry, we're fully booked.

897
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,057
Do you have any room
at this inn?

898
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:56,685
We haven't any room,
but we've got a stable.

899
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,360
So he took them to the stable...

900
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:08,739
Oh, this is nice and cosy,
Joseph...

901
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,452
and cosy Joseph...

902
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:20,959
I said this is nice
and cosy Joseph.

903
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:23,378
Damian? Damian?

904
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:30,469
Yes, this is where our
Lord Baby Jesus will be born.

905
00:58:32,304 --> 00:58:36,475
And so our Saviour came,
bringing peace to all the earth.

906
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:41,438
# Silent night, Holy night...

907
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:42,856
Quick, come on!

908
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:02,978
You stay there.

909
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,595
Oh no the keys!

910
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:14,651
Oh no!

911
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:29,583
Damian!

912
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:30,834
- What you doing?
- Dad!

913
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:32,461
Come here!
Oh God!

914
01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:34,838
Come here! Come here!
It's alright.

915
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:37,341
Let's get you down.
What were you doing?

916
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:38,759
- Is he all right, Dad?
- There we go,

917
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:40,052
- What's he doing?
- Good lad.

918
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:50,479
Well he found it!

919
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:54,274
It just fell out of the sky.
Right in front of me.

920
01:02:54,399 --> 01:02:56,360
I thought it was from God.

921
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,571
From God?

922
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:03,575
It's not really his thing is it,
handing out cash?

923
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:06,370
Why would God hand out...

924
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:11,458
Two hundred and twenty nine thousand,
three hundred and twenty pounds.

925
01:03:16,088 --> 01:03:17,172
Blimey!

926
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:21,468
I was going to give it to the poor,
but it was really hard.

927
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:25,055
Why didn't you tell me?

928
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:28,559
Anthony said not to,
because of the tax.

929
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,397
We could keep some of it though
couldn't we, like a reward?

930
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:35,399
- Get in.
- Oh!

931
01:03:36,525 --> 01:03:38,443
So what are we going
to do with it then?

932
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:40,737
We're going to hand it in.
All of it.

933
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:43,657
Well what else can we do?
It's not ours is it?

934
01:04:25,282 --> 01:04:26,366
Hello?

935
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:30,078
I called round, the door was open.
I've called the police.

936
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:32,789
I thought you might have come home.

937
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:52,142
Everyone gets burgled at
Christmas, Dad.

938
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:55,771
This will be your crime number.

939
01:04:56,313 --> 01:05:00,275
So you can get on to your
insurance company.

940
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:02,569
Of course they can't really
recompense you for this.

941
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:05,364
I mean they can't give you
your Christmas back can they?

942
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:08,492
Probably be next Christmas by
the time you get anything back.

943
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:15,874
I don't suppose you've got any
serial numbers, security codes,

944
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,252
anything like that? No?

945
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:20,963
Well, wouldn't make any difference.

946
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:25,342
It's very rare we get anything back.
Very rare.

947
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:31,557
We know the stolen currency
is around here somewhere.

948
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:33,058
That's what this is all about.

949
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:34,852
But they can't do anything about it.

950
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,979
All the banks have been
warned to look out

951
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:39,857
for anyone making
any large deposits.

952
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,360
And of course,
it's only one day or two,

953
01:05:43,527 --> 01:05:46,864
before they realise
that the money is worthless.

954
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:23,775
What's that?

955
01:06:23,901 --> 01:06:26,570
It's nothing, it's nothing.
It's just my stuff.

956
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:29,573
Oh dad, don't.

957
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:31,867
Oh my God!

958
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,750
This is what they were after.

959
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:44,671
That's a lot of money.
Where did it come from?

960
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:47,758
They took our Christmas.
We'll take their cash.

961
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:50,594
- You can't keep it.
- You're going to keep it?

962
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:52,095
It belongs to the government.

963
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:53,388
They were going to burn it.

964
01:06:53,514 --> 01:06:54,765
They were going to burn
all this money,

965
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:56,391
that's a crime if you ask me.

966
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:58,560
- Definitely.
- But stealing is wrong.

967
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:01,063
If you steal something,
you have to steal it from somebody.

968
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:02,439
Who would we be stealing it from?

969
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:03,857
It's not right!

970
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:06,652
Damian, my house has
just been ransacked.

971
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:08,862
I work every second God sends
just to cover the mortgage,

972
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:10,572
to give you a decent home.

973
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:13,742
And now it's been wrecked.

974
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:16,245
I am owed this.

975
01:07:17,412 --> 01:07:18,872
- But Da...
- Go to bed.

976
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:20,958
Now!

977
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:54,575
- Do you want a story?
- It's wrong.

978
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,578
- Who says?
- God.

979
01:07:58,704 --> 01:07:59,872
Yeah, well.

980
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:03,834
Yeah, well what?

981
01:08:05,377 --> 01:08:08,172
- Don't you want to go to heaven?
- Look around you, Damian.

982
01:08:08,881 --> 01:08:10,174
We're on our own.

983
01:08:10,591 --> 01:08:12,968
No one is smiling
down on us Damian.

984
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:14,761
No one is is looking out for us.

985
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:17,264
So we're looking out
for ourselves.

986
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:19,266
- But mam...
- Is dead.

987
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:24,062
She's dead, Damian.

988
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:29,568
You'll never see her again.
And neither will I.

989
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:37,868
And the money, is ours.

990
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:41,371
We'll take it to town tomorrow
and change it and spend it,

991
01:08:41,497 --> 01:08:42,873
do you hear me?

992
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:46,251
All of it, because it's ours.

993
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:22,663
I know you've got it.
It's mine.

994
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:26,875
And you're going to change
it tomorrow.

995
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:33,257
And that's a good thing. Ok?

996
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:42,766
When you come back.

997
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:48,355
I'm going to call you
on this phone.

998
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:53,277
Open the front door.
Let me in.

999
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:56,155
And we'll take the money.

1000
01:09:57,698 --> 01:10:00,951
And you won't have
to worry about it any more.

1001
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:06,456
Understand?

1002
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:27,853
You make sure your
phone's switched on.

1003
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:35,152
...fifteen.

1004
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:37,779
You take one side and we'll
take the other and then swap.

1005
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:39,281
- All right.
- Ok change what you can

1006
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:41,074
and what you can't change spend.

1007
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,493
Have a ball!

1008
01:10:44,495 --> 01:10:47,372
You do realise, you just
kissed goodbye to the money.

1009
01:10:47,498 --> 01:10:48,999
Come on let's get cracking.

1010
01:10:49,124 --> 01:10:51,126
She's going to run off with it,
you must know that?

1011
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:53,754
- Come on!
- How can she, she's got Damian?

1012
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:56,965
She'll kidnap him, hold him to ransom
for the rest of the money.

1013
01:10:57,508 --> 01:11:00,052
No, Anthony,
that's what you'd do. Come on.

1014
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:12,272
Ok, you wait here all right?

1015
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,281
It's mine.

1016
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:29,748
We'll have to change more
than this.

1017
01:11:29,873 --> 01:11:30,874
- No!
- What?

1018
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:32,251
That's the whole point,

1019
01:11:32,376 --> 01:11:35,838
do it in small amounts and
no one will be suspicious.

1020
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:37,381
Look at the queue.
Look at the time.

1021
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:39,258
We'll be lucky to get round
three banks at this rate.

1022
01:11:39,383 --> 01:11:41,468
You'll be lucky to stay
out the jail.

1023
01:11:41,593 --> 01:11:42,970
- Go on!
- What?

1024
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:46,974
It's just quite
a lot in the circumstances.

1025
01:11:47,099 --> 01:11:48,392
It's five thousand quid.

1026
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:50,686
It's the front half
of a Ford Fiesta.

1027
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:52,688
Is this a bank or a sweet shop?

1028
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:58,152
- What?
- I need a wee.

1029
01:11:58,694 --> 01:11:59,862
Tell her that.

1030
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:01,238
Can I use your loo?

1031
01:12:02,072 --> 01:12:04,158
- Well I'm not sure...
- Well I'm not queuing up again,

1032
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:06,160
the poor kid's been
in here half an hour.

1033
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:07,369
You must have a loo?

1034
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:09,163
What do you do
when you need to go?

1035
01:12:17,087 --> 01:12:19,256
Ok, just this once.

1036
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:27,055
You'll have to go here.

1037
01:12:27,222 --> 01:12:28,974
I don't really need one.

1038
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:33,854
You little belter.

1039
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:38,775
I just can't see
why it's so difficult.

1040
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:40,861
I need a wee.

1041
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:45,782
It's the front half of a Ford Fiesta,
as far as I'm concerned, that's...

1042
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:47,784
I need a wee. I need a wee.

1043
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:05,344
Today's the day, that Britain enters
a new currency era.

1044
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:09,473
You must spend or bank
any remaining old money today.

1045
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,767
It's now or never.
Use it or lose it.

1046
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:15,646
At midnight tonight,
it's euros only for British business.

1047
01:13:15,813 --> 01:13:21,276
Well if you say so for business...
business is... now what was your name.

1048
01:13:22,986 --> 01:13:24,363
- What?
- I've got an idea.

1049
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:26,365
- What?
- Dollars.

1050
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,368
Change it into dollars now
and change it into euros whenever.

1051
01:13:29,493 --> 01:13:31,578
Actually once
all the excitement's over

1052
01:13:31,703 --> 01:13:33,372
the euro will most
likely drop in value.

1053
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:36,667
So we'll probably get
a better exchange rate this way too.

1054
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:45,259
- What?
- Where did I get you?

1055
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:52,808
They've got a bank in there.
It stays open late.

1056
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:55,185
You know everything,
you do, don't you?

1057
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:56,478
Yeah.

1058
01:14:01,692 --> 01:14:02,776
What's wrong?

1059
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,782
How did you know about the bank?

1060
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:14,663
Is this where your mum worked?
In here?

1061
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,376
Well stay there then.

1062
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,253
You'll be alright.
I'll come straight back for you.

1063
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:23,380
I'll do this one. Ok?

1064
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,191
Don't look.

1065
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,866
This is where
your mum used to work.

1066
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:56,163
Nice.

1067
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:02,961
Best get a move on, huh?

1068
01:15:06,715 --> 01:15:07,883
Go on.

1069
01:15:35,494 --> 01:15:37,287
Damian? What you doing?

1070
01:15:39,414 --> 01:15:40,666
Hey, what's up?

1071
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:45,963
Did you think I'd run off
and left you?

1072
01:15:47,631 --> 01:15:48,674
Did you?

1073
01:15:49,716 --> 01:15:51,260
Well I didn't, did I?

1074
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:52,636
No, you didn't.

1075
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:57,474
- The bank's upstairs.
- It's closed.

1076
01:15:59,601 --> 01:16:03,355
And I've had a much better idea.
Come on.

1077
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,357
Let's go and stuff our faces.

1078
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:22,499
Oh I could have had my eye out.

1079
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:23,584
Where are the glasses?

1080
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:26,545
Damian, wants to give
his to the poor.

1081
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,255
Do you?

1082
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:31,175
Of course they won't be poor anymore,
once you've given it to them.

1083
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,343
What'll do you do then,
take it back?

1084
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:36,054
Speaking of which...

1085
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,767
Right mystery activity...
champagne.

1086
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:42,853
...follow me.

1087
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:55,782
A woman opens the door
in her nightie

1088
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:58,160
and I thought funny place
to keep a door...

1089
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:03,540
- This is your fault this.
- What is?

1090
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:05,334
You don't even know, do you?

1091
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:07,377
You brought her
and you don't even know.

1092
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:08,545
What are you on about?

1093
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:10,047
Can you hear them laughing?

1094
01:17:10,214 --> 01:17:12,049
Even he's laughing. Listen.

1095
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:15,177
Very good.

1096
01:17:17,221 --> 01:17:19,890
Once she's got what she came for,
she'll piss off again.

1097
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:21,558
Then he won't be
laughing will he?

1098
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:23,769
It will all start again
like when mam died.

1099
01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:25,896
- He'll be angry...
- Maybe... she, you know,

1100
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:27,189
she won't, she'll stay.

1101
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:30,067
Oh great! Much better.
Is that what you want?

1102
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:32,569
Her in there with him
instead of mam?

1103
01:17:32,694 --> 01:17:33,654
Why are you angry with me?

1104
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:37,074
Because you did it.
You and your weird stuff.

1105
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,369
Chucking money away.
Talking to yourself. Seeing things.

1106
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:42,955
I don't.
I mean maybe I do, but...

1107
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,748
And me! Sticking up for you.

1108
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:47,960
For what?
The truth is, you're a loony!

1109
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:50,754
Don't say that, Anthony.
Please don't say that!

1110
01:17:50,921 --> 01:17:54,258
You're just a fucking loony
and you should be locked up.

1111
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:14,236
Be at the front door
with the money in ten minutes.

1112
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:12,336
Damian! We were...
I was just...

1113
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,858
Dad, don't answer it.

1114
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:37,152
- Dad don't.
- What is going on.

1115
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:38,278
Please!

1116
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:40,572
See this little girls.
My girls.

1117
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:44,535
These girls Santa Claus forgot.
You're our last hope.

1118
01:19:44,701 --> 01:19:46,036
We haven't got a heater home.

1119
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:47,955
Because no point going back
if you don't help

1120
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,456
...took it out.
- Just...

1121
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:50,666
- Who is it?
- Excuse me please.

1122
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:53,335
Wheelchair like these
need your help.

1123
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:54,753
Fifty percent of families

1124
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:56,880
with a chronically ill child,
break up.

1125
01:19:57,005 --> 01:19:58,173
You're maybe asking yourself

1126
01:19:58,298 --> 01:20:00,759
why these Waterloo station
need friends.

1127
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:02,386
Oh, Let me explain.

1128
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:04,680
This is a mid of night.
This is a privat time.

1129
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:05,681
Who are you?

1130
01:20:05,806 --> 01:20:09,184
Get out please. Get mind.
Just leaving.

1131
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:10,769
Go on, you and your...
get out.

1132
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:12,396
- Come on
- Two euro's a month...

1133
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:13,981
- It's absolutely...
- Would you be prepared

1134
01:20:14,106 --> 01:20:15,399
to consider a direct debit.

1135
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:27,744
Just shut up, will you?

1136
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,352
Damian?
Damian?

1137
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:06,658
This is that same donkey
as he looks after

1138
01:21:06,783 --> 01:21:08,368
just a few months
in our sanctuary.

1139
01:21:08,494 --> 01:21:10,579
- I think you'll agree...
- All right love. Put him down.

1140
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:11,747
Shall we?

1141
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:28,847
You'd better tell me
how this started?

1142
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:30,766
I've no idea.

1143
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:33,143
Some one must have said
something strange.

1144
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,436
Digital?

1145
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:37,147
Yeah that's right, yeah.

1146
01:21:37,314 --> 01:21:40,359
How do you find it?
I'm yet to be convinced.

1147
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:42,152
Well you can come and have a look,
when you get rid of that lot.

1148
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:43,654
Mmm. One step at a time, eh?

1149
01:21:43,821 --> 01:21:45,781
Any chance of a bit of toast?

1150
01:21:45,906 --> 01:21:47,783
You do that,
I'll have a look around.

1151
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:56,166
Evening, lad.

1152
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,367
You.

1153
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:36,165
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1154
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:38,834
- Ha? Where is he?
- Upstairs.

1155
01:23:26,215 --> 01:23:28,091
Peaceful isn't it?

1156
01:23:28,717 --> 01:23:29,885
Who are you?

1157
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:34,598
Who am I?

1158
01:23:38,477 --> 01:23:39,770
Who are you?

1159
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:42,272
We're the police.

1160
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:33,949
Oh.

1161
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:40,372
I know you're only a dream.
But I don't care.

1162
01:24:40,497 --> 01:24:44,042
It's nice to see you.
Even if you're just a dream.

1163
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:48,839
The money just makes
everything worse.

1164
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:52,050
I've got something for you.

1165
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:54,761
From Readers Digest. Here.

1166
01:24:58,015 --> 01:25:01,268
You may have already
won ten thousand pounds.

1167
01:25:03,687 --> 01:25:05,772
Please will you talk to me?

1168
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:10,694
Five minutes. Ok?

1169
01:25:15,699 --> 01:25:17,826
Now, don't interrupt.
I'm dead.

1170
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:20,245
I know what I'm talking about, ok?

1171
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:22,748
You need to use conditioner
on your hair.

1172
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:25,959
Your dad won't think of that,
but it makes all the difference.

1173
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:29,171
Me?

1174
01:25:30,005 --> 01:25:32,549
You are not to worry about me.

1175
01:25:34,593 --> 01:25:36,553
You have been worrying about me,
haven't you?

1176
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:40,182
I'm fine.

1177
01:25:41,892 --> 01:25:43,060
Anthony.

1178
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:46,396
He seems to have taken
it better than you.

1179
01:25:46,522 --> 01:25:47,689
But he hasn't.

1180
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:50,567
He's got a good heart,
he just...

1181
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:52,236
he doesn't know where it is.

1182
01:25:52,402 --> 01:25:53,529
Damian?

1183
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:56,949
He's going to need you.
Be good to him.

1184
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:58,742
Dad doesn't believe.

1185
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:01,370
Doesn't believe what?

1186
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:06,542
Any of it. Anything.
He mustn't do or he wouldn't.

1187
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:07,960
Couldn't you talk to him?

1188
01:26:08,085 --> 01:26:10,462
- He can't see me.
- Oh.

1189
01:26:10,587 --> 01:26:12,589
Is it because of the money?

1190
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:18,178
In a way. The money makes
it harder to see what's what.

1191
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:20,764
You know that already.

1192
01:26:26,979 --> 01:26:29,273
Never really win
with those things anyway.

1193
01:26:29,398 --> 01:26:30,566
You just end up
with books about

1194
01:26:30,691 --> 01:26:33,068
the building of
the American Railways.

1195
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:38,365
It's her isn't it?

1196
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:41,952
Your dad and her?

1197
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:45,873
Damian.

1198
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,465
You know how complicated
the money was?

1199
01:26:55,215 --> 01:26:58,969
Well... people are even more
complicated.

1200
01:27:00,888 --> 01:27:01,847
You need to remember

1201
01:27:01,972 --> 01:27:05,142
that there is nearly always enough
good around to be going on with.

1202
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:07,769
You've just got to have a bit
of faith, you know.

1203
01:27:07,895 --> 01:27:10,856
And if you've got faith in people
that makes them stronger.

1204
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:15,068
And you, you've got enough
to sort all three of you out.

1205
01:27:16,904 --> 01:27:20,866
Hey? That's why
I'm counting on you.

1206
01:27:23,118 --> 01:27:25,787
I haven't really
been worried about you.

1207
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:27,664
I've just been missing you.

1208
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:30,626
That's allowed.

1209
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:34,838
Are you really a Saint?

1210
01:27:35,881 --> 01:27:40,260
Well, the criteria's very strict.

1211
01:27:40,385 --> 01:27:43,472
It's not just a case
of doing good and all that.

1212
01:27:43,597 --> 01:27:45,974
You do have to do
an actual miracle.

1213
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,643
So...

1214
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:50,270
I'm in there. Course I am.

1215
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:52,272
What was your miracle?

1216
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:55,484
Don't you know?

1217
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:58,987
It was you.

1218
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:12,334
Hey?

1219
01:28:13,502 --> 01:28:15,379
Aren't you going to say goodbye?

1220
01:28:24,888 --> 01:28:25,973
Bye.

1221
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:14,271
Did you see her?

1222
01:29:15,397 --> 01:29:16,773
What did she say?

1223
01:29:17,274 --> 01:29:19,568
She said to tell
you not to worry.

1224
01:29:19,693 --> 01:29:21,737
It's all going to be alright.

1225
01:29:24,281 --> 01:29:26,074
She's looking out for you

1226
01:29:27,784 --> 01:29:29,161
Come on!

1227
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,428
Well it was fun
while it lasted, eh?

1228
01:29:57,314 --> 01:29:58,774
Look there's no easy way to say this,

1229
01:29:58,899 --> 01:30:03,779
but I put a bit to one side,
for me, to spend.

1230
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,572
You can have it back.

1231
01:30:05,697 --> 01:30:09,284
Dorothy, six thousand,
three hundred and ten euros.

1232
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:10,953
All for the best, eh?

1233
01:30:13,497 --> 01:30:14,665
Dollars.

1234
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:16,583
It's just a few grand.

1235
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:17,835
Dad?

1236
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:19,336
Ten really.

1237
01:30:19,503 --> 01:30:21,839
Eleven thousand,
four hundred dollars.

1238
01:30:22,005 --> 01:30:23,340
I was going to tell you.

1239
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:25,968
I sort of kept them by mistake.

1240
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:29,138
Anthony.

1241
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,473
I just enjoyed having a wedge.

1242
01:30:31,598 --> 01:30:34,977
It wasn't really the money.
I just liked having it.

1243
01:30:35,102 --> 01:30:38,355
Four thousand,
seven hundred and eighty euros.

1244
01:30:40,023 --> 01:30:42,568
Dorothy wanted a holiday
of a lifetime.

1245
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:44,194
Dad wanted to pay off
all his credit cards.

1246
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:45,571
Come on Dad.

1247
01:30:45,696 --> 01:30:48,991
Anthony wanted
one game boy advanced xp.

1248
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:52,661
One play station three.
A Shogun new BMX bike.

1249
01:30:52,786 --> 01:30:55,330
A Rekia five hundred super
quad bike.

1250
01:30:55,497 --> 01:30:58,876
Nimbus two thousand
eltro-magnetic stair rider.

1251
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:02,880
A table top candy floss maker.
An iPOD, obviously.

1252
01:31:03,005 --> 01:31:04,673
An iBOT obviously.

1253
01:31:04,798 --> 01:31:07,259
And a stamp on it hydraulic
rocket capable of

1254
01:31:07,384 --> 01:31:10,846
a attaining altitudes
of over one hundred metres.

1255
01:31:11,805 --> 01:31:13,265
Three...

1256
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:14,766
Two...

1257
01:31:14,892 --> 01:31:16,059
One...

1258
01:31:28,989 --> 01:31:31,867
That's how Anthony
would want this story to end.

1259
01:31:31,992 --> 01:31:33,744
With big piles of stuff.

1260
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:36,663
But it's not his story.
It's mine.

1261
01:31:36,788 --> 01:31:39,166
Oh, regarde ca.
Qu'est-ce-que c'est?

1262
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:43,378
This is where I want it to end.
