00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,814
We should've talked
at the boatyard.

2
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,150
You don't wanna
talk about it here.

3
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:25,821
I'm not falling all over
myself to talk about
it much of anywhere, Jack.

4
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,573
How much do you know?

5
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:28,657
Not much.

6
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:36,915
The Birmingham one
was in the papers
over a month ago.

7
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:40,878
The second one in Atlanta
was all over TV.

8
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,088
Did you ever think
about giving me a call?

9
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:44,840
No.

10
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,466
Why not?

11
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:48,093
I quit. Remember?

12
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,933
You look all right now.

13
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,729
I am all right.

14
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:14,536
If you can't
look anymore,
I understand.

15
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,457
Don't try to run
a game down on me, Jack.

16
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:28,301
If I really didn't need you
to come back, I wouldn't ask.

17
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:29,844
This guy's on a lunar cycle.

18
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:33,431
I have three weeks
and a few days until
the next full moon.

19
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:38,353
We have a better chance
to get him fast if you help.

20
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,648
I'll think about it.

21
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,025
Stay and eat.

22
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:38,162
Hi, Molly.

23
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,260
Think it'll keep
them out, Dad?

24
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:53,469
Yep.

25
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,141
How many turtle eggs
do you think are in here?

26
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,225
In this hatchery?

27
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,561
I'll bet there's
40 or 50 of them.

28
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,481
Crabs get most
of the newborns, huh?

29
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,358
Yeah, but not now.

30
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:09,902
These are all gonna
make it, guaranteed.

31
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:15,783
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?

32
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,160
They can't dig under.

33
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,038
That's why we bury
the wire down in the sand.

34
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,751
We need more staples, pal.

35
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,345
You're supposed
to be his friend, Jack.

36
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,556
Why didn't you
leave him alone?

37
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,685
If he decides
to do it, Molly,

38
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,440
I'll keep him
as far away
from it as I can.

39
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:03,874
We got it pretty good,
don't we?

40
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,043
We have it more than good.

41
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:10,172
All that happened to you
before lets you know that.

42
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,470
If I went back,
I'd only look at evidence.

43
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:20,140
I wouldn't get
deeply involved.

44
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:23,310
He'd never even
see me or know my name.

45
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:27,356
If they find him,
they'll have to take
him down, not me.

46
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,778
What do you think?

47
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:40,077
I think you've already decided
and you're not really asking.

48
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,998
If I were asking?

49
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:49,044
Stay here with me,

50
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,004
me and Kevin.

51
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:54,299
But it's selfish,
and I know it.

52
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:01,765
Come here.

53
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:04,036
OFFICER: I'll come inside
with you, if you want,
to show you around.

54
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,674
Mr. Crawford said maybe
you'd want to be alone, but...

55
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,259
That's right.

56
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:23,389
There's a VCR hooked up
in your hotel room.

57
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:28,895
They transferred
some home movies of both
families onto half-inch VHS.

58
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:30,230
Thanks.

59
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:16,419
Intruder entered through
kitchen sliding door.

60
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:19,213
Used a glass cutter
anchored to a suction cup.

61
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:21,090
His entry was skillful.

62
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:25,220
All the prints
are smooth gloves.

63
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:29,433
Blond hair, strong,
size 12 shoe imprint.

64
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:35,773
Blood AB positive,
typed from saliva on glass
from licking the suction cup.

65
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:40,027
Why didn't he care that
he left saliva on the glass?

66
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:46,367
It was hot out that night,

67
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:49,578
so inside the house
must have felt cool to him.

68
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,251
Intruder cut Charles Leeds'
throat as he was rising,

69
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:58,337
then shot Mrs. Leeds.

70
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,798
Bullet entered right
of her navel and lodged
in her lumbar spine,

71
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:03,550
but she died
of strangulation.

72
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,886
Moderate elevation
of serotonin
and marked increase

73
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,388
of free histamine level
in gunshot wound

74
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:11,392
indicates she lived
at least five minutes
after she was shot.

75
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:15,396
All her other injuries
were post-mortem.

Direction and velocity
of bloodstains on east wall
indicate arterial spray.

77
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,569
Even with his throat cut,
Leeds tried to fight

78
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:26,115
because the intruder
was moving
to the children's room.

79
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,327
Bloodstains on west wall
of master bedroom

marks on hall carpet
remain unexplained,

as does superficial ligature
mark around Mr. Leeds' chest,

82
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,506

to be post-mortem.

God, she's lovely,
isn't she?

113

It was maddening to have
to touch her with rubber
gloves on, wasn't it?

114

powder on her leg,

any talcum powder
in the bathroom.

out of a rubber glove

as you pulled
it off to touch her.

to touch her, didn't you?

Didn't you,
you son of a bitch?

your gloves back on.

00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:25,582

off his gloves.

Lecktor killed nine
people, didn't he?

175

Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.

What happened to them?

177
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:06,828
One's on a respirator
at a hospital in Baltimore,

178
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:09,164
the other's in a private
mental hospital in Denver.

say was wrong with Lecktor?

181
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:16,671
The psychologists
call him a psychopath.

182

They don't know
what else to call him.

183
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,263
I understand
he cut you
pretty good.

What about the dog?

185
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:37,150
It's at the vet's. The kids
brought it in with a puncture
wound in the abdomen.

186
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:39,444
The Jacobis in Birmingham
had a cat, didn't they?

187
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:40,862
That's right.

188
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:45,075
We found
a litter box downstairs,
but we didn't find a cat.

probe out of Washington,

the back yard.

191

You got Will Graham here, too.

199
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,264
I got a partial print
with a tented arch,
it's probably a thumb.

200
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,143
And the fragment
of a palm off the nail

have the use of my arms.

351

Would you be so kind
as to dial a number
for me, please?

352
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:05,825
Certainly. What's the number?

He's not in,
but I'll connect you
to his office.

Hi, Martha.

363
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:32,268
Martha doesn't
come in nights.

364
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:35,020
Maybe you can help me.

365
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:37,690
This is Bob Greer
of Blaine & Edwards
publishing company,

366
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:39,859
Dr. Bloom asked me
to send a copy

367
00:31:39,943 --> 00:31:41,694
of The Psychiatrist
and the Law to someone.

368
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:44,321
Martha never sent me
the address and phone number.

369
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:45,865
She'll be in in the morning.

370
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:49,368
Well, I've got to catch
Federal Express in about
five minutes.

371
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:52,580
I'd be immensely appreciative
if you could pull it out
of her Rolodex for me.

372
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:53,998
I don't see a Rolodex.

373
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:56,792
I'll bet she has a call caddy
right next to her phone.

374
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:58,669
Yeah...
Well, zip that
little pointer

375
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:00,921
right on down
to the letter G.

376
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,131

00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:18,230
Now, I'll bet it has his
home address there, too.

It's all right. Stewardess!

CAPTAIN ON PA SYSTEM:
Ladies and gentlemen,

392
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:34,451
we are beginning our descent
into Birmingham.

393
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:37,491
WILL: You used a cutting
tool on the branch
so that you could see.

394
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:39,743
Then you passed
the time whittling

395
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:42,496
and dreaming.

396
00:36:44,499 --> 00:36:46,000
When night came,

397
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,753
you saw them pass by
their bright windows.

398
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,756
Then you watched
the shades go down,

399
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:56,343
then you saw the lights
go out, one by one.

400
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:58,888
Then after a while,
you climbed down

401
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:01,182
and you went in to them,
didn't you?

402
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:02,350
Didn't you,
you son of a bitch?

403
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:05,270
You watched them
all goddamned day long!

404
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:10,650
That's why houses
with big yards.

405

WILL: I need Firearms
and Tool Marks section
out here on a severed branch.

406
00:37:18,743 --> 00:37:20,410
I need to know what kind
of cutting tool he used.

407
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:22,579
And then I need
Bowman in Documents
to fall on this carving.

408
00:37:22,663 --> 00:37:23,663
JACK: Is it weird?

409
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:24,998
The mark? Yeah.

410
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,876
If Documents
can't do the carving,
I'll send it up to Langley.

411
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,878
WILL: Did Price
get an identification
off the Leeds print?

412
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:31,838
No, Price hasn't found
him in the index yet.

413
00:37:31,923 --> 00:37:34,424
It's a hand search.
He's got half
his department on it.

When we were cleaning
out Dr. Lecktor's cell,

426
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:03,328
he heard us coming
and hid something
in a book.

out of there
and dug around.

I need to speak
to Mr. Graham right away.

00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:29,729
He's not here,
he's in Birmingham.

436

Special Agent Crawford
is on the line with him now.

437
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:33,942
Please tell them
this is very, very urgent.

438
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:35,026
I'll hold on.

it's Jack Crawford.

440
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:41,783
You have Will Graham
on the line, too.

or two pieces of a note

442
00:38:45,037 --> 00:38:47,831
that appears to be
from that man who killed
those people in Atlanta.

443
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:49,666
Where did you get it?

444
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,793
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.

445
00:38:51,877 --> 00:38:55,046
WILL: Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?

446
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:57,340
It's written
on toilet tissue.

447
00:38:58,217 --> 00:39:00,385
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,

00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:04,514

more inappropriate?

"I hope we can correspond."

There's a piece missing here.

I don't care whose it is.

Two, call Alabama
Air National Guard,

468
00:40:00,113 --> 00:40:01,989
get Graham back
here right now.

469
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:04,033
Then call Documents
and tell them
to scramble a team.

I want everybody moving
five minutes ago.
You understand?

471

JACK: I have a Documents
team on its way to you

472
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,747
by helicopter
to pick up the note.

473
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,207
Listen, after we've
worked the note,

474
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,625
I want to replace
it in Lecktor's cell.

475
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,210
I don't want Lecktor to know
that we've found it,

476
00:40:14,294 --> 00:40:16,253
he might try to warn
the killer somehow.

477
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:17,338
Where's Lecktor now?

478
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:18,547
CHILTON: Holding cell.

479
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:20,883
How long can you keep
him in there without
him getting suspicious?

480
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,927
CHILTON: Three, four hours.

481
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:25,054
Brian, we have a note
coming in on the flight,

482
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:27,807
possibly from the Tooth Fairy,
number one priority.

483
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:29,058
It has to go
to Hair and Fiber,

484
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:30,393
Latent Prints,
and then Documents.

485
00:40:30,477 --> 00:40:32,353
Will Graham and I
will be walking it through.

486
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:14,645
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.

487
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:17,481
And a couple of blue grains.

488
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:19,775
Work the hair.

489
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,819
What do we have
for negative comparison?

490
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:26,115
Hair from Lecktor's comb,
whiskers from Lecktor's
razor they let him use.

491
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,784
This is hair from
the security guard.

492
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:52,559
MAN: How many guys
handled this without gloves?

493
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,436
The guard,
cleanup man, Lecktor.

494
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,313
The cleanup man
scrubbing sinks

495
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:59,399
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.

496
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,610
But the others...

497
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:02,903
One smudge.

498
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:08,074
Those aren't ridges.

499
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,744
It's just the texture
of the paper.

500
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:11,995
I can fume for a print,

501
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,331
but can't guarantee
the iodine stains
would fade out.

502
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:15,832
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?

503
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:16,958
No.

504
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:19,294
We couldn't wash it after.

505
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:22,255
I can't get a print off this
in the time you've got
to get it back, Will.

506
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:24,174
BOWMAN: How long do I have?

507
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:25,258
JACK: Twenty minutes, max.

508
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,510
BOWMAN: The main thing
to find out is,

509
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:28,970
how was Lecktor supposed
to reply to him?

510
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:31,848
Which is probably
the missing section,
because at the top it says,

511
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:35,060
"I hope we can correspond,"
then comes the gap.

512
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:39,439
This note was written
in ballpoint,

513
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,610
but it looks like Lecktor
went over this area
with a felt-tip pen,

514
00:42:44,153 --> 00:42:46,029
then tore it away.

515
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:17,060
You're so sly,

516
00:43:17,144 --> 00:43:18,895
but so am I.

517
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:30,865
The aniline dyes used
in the ink of the felt-tip
pens like Lecktor used

518
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,118
are transparent to infrared.

519
00:43:33,202 --> 00:43:35,996
The Tooth Fairy's
ballpoint isn't.

520
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,840
This looks like the tip
of a T here, here, and here.

521
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:49,801
At the end is what
could be the top of an R.

522
00:43:50,386 --> 00:43:52,095
There's three Ts
and an R in "Tattler."

523
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:53,263
We know our boy reads it.

524
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:54,973
The article about me
and Lecktor.

525
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:57,601
I don't know anybody else
that's carried that.

526
00:43:58,477 --> 00:43:59,769
Personal ads.

527
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:06,110
We believe the Tooth Fairy
told Lecktor to reply to him

528
00:44:06,194 --> 00:44:09,071
through the personal
ad section of
the National Tattler.

529
00:44:09,156 --> 00:44:12,199
The Chicago office
is down there right now
running through their ads.

530
00:44:12,284 --> 00:44:14,452
We have cut into
a line of communication

531
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:16,621
between the Tooth Fairy
and Lecktor.

532
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:19,415
If we find Lecktor's
reply we plan to pull it,

533
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:21,500
substitute it
with one of our own.

534
00:44:21,585 --> 00:44:24,378
And this is what
the Tooth Fairy
will read. Bill?

535
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:28,382
"Dear Avid Fan,
inherit my mantle and surpass
my achievements.

536
00:44:28,467 --> 00:44:31,677
"Mementoes for you
at Baltimore Central
Left Luggage.

537
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:33,888
"Ticket number 72683."

538
00:44:34,556 --> 00:44:36,599
It's a Secret Service
letter drop.

539
00:44:36,683 --> 00:44:37,808
We plan to stake it out.

540
00:44:37,893 --> 00:44:38,976
When he shows,
we'll grab him.

541
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:40,811
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH: Not yet.

542
00:44:40,896 --> 00:44:42,813
When do they go to press?

543
00:44:42,898 --> 00:44:44,315
JACK: Thirty-five minutes.

544
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,108
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.

545
00:44:46,193 --> 00:44:47,735
There was no print.

546
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:49,570
Scale counts
and core size of the hair

547
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:52,073
match the blond hair
found in the Jacobis'.

548
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:54,575
That note was written
by your man.

549
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,994
Aside from the hair,
three blue grains,

550
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,954
dark flecks,
went to Brian's end.

551
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:01,666
The grains are commercial
granulated cleanser
with chlorine,

552
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,708
from the cleaning man.

553
00:45:02,793 --> 00:45:05,127
Several particles
of dried blood,
but not enough to type.

554
00:45:05,212 --> 00:45:06,754
(PHONE RINGING)

555
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:09,382
OVER PHONE: This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?

556
00:45:09,466 --> 00:45:11,008
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.

557
00:45:11,093 --> 00:45:14,720
Got a personal ad with
"Avid Fan" in it being
telexed to you right now.

558
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:16,764
Read it.
"Dear Avid Fan,

559
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:18,474
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."

560
00:45:18,558 --> 00:45:19,642
JACK: Oh, Christ.

561
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:22,103
"I offer 100 prayers
for your safety.

562
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:27,650
"Find help in Galatians
6: 11, 15:2,

563
00:45:27,734 --> 00:45:31,696
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,

564
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:36,117
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,

565
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:38,452
"Luke 1:7."

566
00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:40,204
JACK: Thanks.

567
00:45:46,503 --> 00:45:48,045
Jimmy.

568
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,214
Did you get anywhere
at all identifying him
off the Leeds' prints?

569
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:51,465
Not yet.

570
00:45:54,803 --> 00:45:56,345
Photography at Langley?

571
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,973
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.

572
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:16,073
No. And our ad has to go
out in the same book
code Lecktor used,

573
00:46:16,158 --> 00:46:17,575
or he'll know
it wasn't Lecktor
talking to him.

574
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:18,743
Book code?

575
00:46:18,827 --> 00:46:20,369
"100 prayers" could
be the page number,

576
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:21,872
the paired numbers
could be line and letter.

577
00:46:21,956 --> 00:46:23,123
But what book?
JACK: Not the Bible?

578
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:24,207
No.

579
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:25,250
Galatians 15:2.

580
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:26,835
Galatians only
has six chapters.

581
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:27,919
The same with Jonah 6:8.

582
00:46:28,004 --> 00:46:29,588
Jonah only has
four chapters.

583
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:31,673
Lecktor was not
using the Bible.

584
00:46:32,258 --> 00:46:34,843
Then the Tooth Fairy
probably named the book
in the part Lecktor tore out.

585
00:46:34,927 --> 00:46:36,344
Right.

586
00:46:37,013 --> 00:46:38,889
What about sweating Lecktor?

587
00:46:38,973 --> 00:46:41,016
They tried sodium amytal
on him three years ago
to find where

588
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,350
he buried a Princeton student.

589
00:46:42,435 --> 00:46:43,810
He gave them a recipe
for potato chip dip.

590
00:46:43,895 --> 00:46:44,978
JACK: Wonderful.

591
00:46:46,314 --> 00:46:49,691
The Tooth Fairy would have
named a book he knew
Lecktor has access to.

592
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:51,485
He'd know it from articles
he'd read about Lecktor.

593
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:53,028
JACK: Willingham,
when he tossed his cell,

594
00:46:53,112 --> 00:46:54,988
took Polaroids so they can
get everything back in place.

595
00:46:55,072 --> 00:46:57,699
Have him meet me
with pictures
of Lecktor's books.

596
00:46:57,784 --> 00:46:59,618
JACK: Where?
BOWMAN: Library of Congress.

597
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:08,126
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.

598
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:11,254
Lecktor's ad runs as is,
we decode it later.

599
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:15,467
Or we pull it,
figure out the code
and run our own ad next week.

600
00:47:15,551 --> 00:47:16,510
And lose a week?

601
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:17,636
We got 17 days till
the next full moon.

602
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,389
And I don't like
Lecktor's ad running
without knowing what it says.

603
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:24,726
It's your call, Will.

604
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,897
Run it.

605
00:47:29,899 --> 00:47:33,944
And what if it encourages
the Tooth Fairy to do
something else beside write?

606
00:47:34,028 --> 00:47:36,279
We'll all feel sick
for a very long time.

607
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:39,699
JACK: And if Bowman
still can't figure it out?

608
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:42,327
Then we'll bait him
with something else
in next week's Tattler.

609
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:43,912
JACK: What, for instance?

610
00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:47,582
Me.

611
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:51,711
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

612
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:56,925
Why not?

613
00:47:57,009 --> 00:47:58,343
Don't you think
we can provoke him?

614
00:47:58,427 --> 00:48:00,762
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.

615
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:02,430
What I was thinking
about is you.

616
00:48:04,308 --> 00:48:06,142
You're getting deeper
and deeper into this.

617
00:48:06,227 --> 00:48:07,727
Good night.

618
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:08,812
Sidney.

619
00:48:08,896 --> 00:48:09,938
I'll talk to you.

620
00:48:12,149 --> 00:48:13,859
Last time you did that
you did a real good job

621
00:48:13,943 --> 00:48:16,236
of pushing yourself
all out of shape.

622
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:19,447
You try it on again
or you go through
some big trauma,

623
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:21,700
you could relapse,
my friend.

624
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:23,910
Sidney,
don't worry about me.

625
00:48:23,995 --> 00:48:27,163
I'm working the evidence,
making moves. That's all.

626
00:48:28,499 --> 00:48:29,749
I'm fine.

627
00:48:32,295 --> 00:48:34,129
Bowman just struck out.

628
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:36,590
It is not books
in Lecktor's cell.

629
00:48:37,258 --> 00:48:38,216
Price?

630
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:39,634
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.

631
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:42,221
As evidence, the Leeds print
will get us a conviction

632
00:48:42,306 --> 00:48:44,181
if we could ever
find the guy.

633
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:47,518
But he must never
have been printed because
he is not in our index.

634
00:48:47,603 --> 00:48:50,104
We are not gonna
identify him off the print.

635
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:55,276
I'll use Lounds.

636
00:48:56,236 --> 00:48:57,486
What for?

637
00:48:58,238 --> 00:49:00,489
Our boy doesn't
read the New York Times
literary supplement.

638
00:49:00,574 --> 00:49:02,575
He reads Lounds
in the Tattler.

639
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:09,624
What else should we cover?

640
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:12,585
He put the shorts
on Charles Leeds
after he was dead.

641
00:49:12,669 --> 00:49:16,172
I believe
he did this to make sure
we wouldn't think he was gay.

642
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:22,011
He's molested
all of his male victims.

643
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:25,431
He may be impotent
with members
of the opposite sex.

644
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:28,059
Our forensic
psychologists
have projected,

645
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:30,019
though I'm not sure,

646
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,772
that he may have had sexual
relations with his mother.

647
00:49:32,856 --> 00:49:34,106
(LAUGHS)

648
00:49:38,737 --> 00:49:41,948
So, how long do you plan
to stay in Washington?

649
00:49:42,032 --> 00:49:43,449
Till we've taken
out the Tooth Fairy.

650
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:45,701
LOUNDS: Can the Tattler rely
on getting the straight stuff
from you?

651
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:46,786
Absolutely.

652
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:49,413
How does working on this case
affect your sex life?

653
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:52,959
Mine? It doesn't affect mine,
it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.

654
00:49:53,043 --> 00:49:54,543
Look, pal of mine,
you're news.

655
00:49:54,628 --> 00:49:56,087
Shoot the pictures.

656
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:57,880
All right, Symie,
let's shoot them.

657
00:49:57,965 --> 00:49:59,131
I'm in the shots
with Graham.

658
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:00,800
What?
I'm in the shots with you.

659
00:50:00,884 --> 00:50:03,469
Come on, you want this
to look real or not?

660
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:08,975
Make sure the theater sign
across the street is just
slightly out of focus.

661
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:10,768
We want him to be able
to read it so he can find it,

662
00:50:10,852 --> 00:50:11,852
but we don't want
to look too obvious.

663
00:50:11,937 --> 00:50:15,106
You make sure that
I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.

664
00:50:16,942 --> 00:50:17,984
One more.

665
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:20,069
One more.
That's enough.

666
00:50:20,237 --> 00:50:22,863
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?

667
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:24,615
Let's have lunch,
call my service.

668
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,701
Crawford, always a thrill.

669
00:50:26,785 --> 00:50:30,037
Dr. Bloom. I need them
on my desk in two hours.

670
00:50:39,256 --> 00:50:40,339
Did Bowman break
the code yet?

671
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:41,424
No.

672
00:50:41,675 --> 00:50:44,802
Tools and Firearms
say the cutting tool
used on the severed branch

673
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:46,846
was a common bolt cutter.

674
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:49,724
I got a call from
Asian Studies at Langley.

675
00:50:49,808 --> 00:50:51,559
The mark you found
on the tree?
Yeah?

676
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:55,688
It's a Chinese character
considered a lucky sign
in gambling.

677
00:50:55,772 --> 00:50:58,858
That same character appears
on a Mah Jongg piece.

678
00:50:58,942 --> 00:51:01,987
It means "Red Dragon."
Mean anything to you?

679
00:51:04,991 --> 00:51:06,033
No.

680
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,538
If he shows,
and he's smart,

01:05:59,766 --> 01:06:02,184
It said you were
in a special hospital.

860
01:06:05,313 --> 01:06:07,481
Well, it was
a regular hospital,

861
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:11,193
then I was transferred
into the psychiatric wing.

862
01:06:12,195 --> 01:06:14,571
That bothers you,
doesn't it?

863
01:06:15,365 --> 01:06:17,032
I don't know.

864
01:06:17,867 --> 01:06:21,244
Was it because
in the papers it said
it was this man Lecktor?

865
01:06:21,788 --> 01:06:23,038
Mmm-hmm.

866
01:06:23,706 --> 01:06:25,332
What happened?

867
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:30,379
Well, Lecktor was attacking
college girls,
then he killed them.

868
01:06:31,506 --> 01:06:32,965
How?

869
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:36,468
In bad ways.

870
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,722
He was a psychiatrist.

871
01:06:41,391 --> 01:06:43,308
One of the girls
was his patient,

872
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:45,310
and I went to talk
to him about her.

873
01:06:48,314 --> 01:06:52,317
I tried to build feelings
in my imagination
like the killer had

874
01:06:52,402 --> 01:06:55,112
so that I would know
why he did what he did,

875
01:06:55,196 --> 01:06:57,614
because that would
help me find him.

876
01:06:58,533 --> 01:07:00,659
When I was sitting
in Lecktor's office

877
01:07:00,743 --> 01:07:03,412
and I looked up,
I saw a book on his shelf.

878
01:07:03,496 --> 01:07:05,706
It had pictures of
war wounds in it.

879
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,542
And I knew it was him.

880
01:07:10,128 --> 01:07:13,755
So I went to a pay phone
down the hall
to call the police

881
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:17,092
and that's when
he attacked me.

882
01:07:21,598 --> 01:07:24,392
You and Mom
came to see me
in the hospital,

883
01:07:24,476 --> 01:07:26,102
and that helped a lot.

884
01:07:27,604 --> 01:07:30,106
But after my body got okay,

885
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:34,277
I still had his thoughts
going around in my head.

886
01:07:36,572 --> 01:07:38,614
And I stopped
talking to people.

887
01:07:41,577 --> 01:07:45,413
And a doctor friend of mine,
a Dr. Bloom,
asked me to get some help.

888
01:07:45,873 --> 01:07:47,123
And I did.

889
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:51,461
Then after a while
I felt better,
and I was okay again.

890
01:07:55,799 --> 01:07:58,551
And the way
he thought felt that bad?

891
01:07:59,845 --> 01:08:01,596
Kevin,

892
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,974
they're the ugliest
thoughts in the world.

893
01:08:20,783 --> 01:08:22,992
So, what kind of
coffee do you like?

894
01:08:26,163 --> 01:08:28,498
You like that
Folgers stuff, right?

895
01:08:29,124 --> 01:08:30,208
Yeah.

896
01:08:31,627 --> 01:08:33,169
Mom likes that, too.

897
01:08:37,216 --> 01:08:39,258
When can we go home, Dad?

898
01:08:41,428 --> 01:08:42,970
I don't know, Kevin.

899
01:08:58,946 --> 01:09:00,696
So, where are things?

900
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:03,407
Nowhere.

901
01:09:05,494 --> 01:09:09,163
Everything we've tried
is either a dead end
or it's backfired.

902
01:09:09,248 --> 01:09:13,251
Crawford's already planning
the next crime scene
so they can get it fresh.

903
01:09:15,671 --> 01:09:19,132

till the next full moon.

907
01:09:31,103 --> 01:09:32,728

909
01:09:34,523 --> 01:09:35,731
No.

exactly what you said you...

it's gotta stop.

gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.

914

should go to Montana.

1034
01:22:32,765 --> 01:22:36,017
Turning this night inside

1035
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:39,395
And the light from you

1036
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,500
Is there a flame in the dark?

1037
01:23:02,044 --> 01:23:04,504
Is there a bright heart star?

1038
01:23:06,507 --> 01:23:09,550
These creatures
look the same now

1039
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:13,221
We freeze wherever we are

1040
01:23:15,265 --> 01:23:19,227
We wake alone in the blackness

1041
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:22,397
We sleep wherever we fall

1042
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:26,985
One dream all around us

1043
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:30,571
This big hush infects us all

1044
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,743
Forever in this half-light

1045
01:23:35,828 --> 01:23:39,540
All desire

1046
01:23:39,624 --> 01:23:42,835
The ashes and the fire

All desire

1051

The ashes and the fire

Turning this night inside

1055
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:32,885
Yeah, I'm fine.

1056
01:24:35,221 --> 01:24:36,305
Hi.

(DOLLARHYDE CHUCKLES)

1058
01:24:37,515 --> 01:24:39,141
Good morning.
Morning.

1059
01:24:42,562 --> 01:24:44,772
You know, if you show me
where things are,
I'll make us some coffee.

1060
01:24:44,856 --> 01:24:45,939
No, no...

1061
01:24:47,817 --> 01:24:49,318
Don't go back
inside the house.

1062
01:24:49,402 --> 01:24:51,236
Why? I left
my purse inside.

1063
01:24:52,447 --> 01:24:54,031
I'll get it. It's okay.

1064
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:04,374
I mean, you should stay
outside, it's... It's...

1065
01:25:05,585 --> 01:25:08,378
It's 'cause you look
so good in the sun.

1066
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,589
(LAUGHING) Okay.

1068
01:25:19,265 --> 01:25:21,016
When...

1069
01:25:24,312 --> 01:25:26,647
Reba, when can
I see you again?

1070
01:25:27,774 --> 01:25:29,066
Oh! Um...

1071
01:25:31,528 --> 01:25:33,570
We could meet
at my house.

1072
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:48,752
JACK OVER PHONE: You got
the message Lecktor called?

1073
01:25:48,837 --> 01:25:50,420
Yeah. I arranged
for him to have a phone.

1074
01:25:50,505 --> 01:25:51,547
I gotta call him
in a few minutes.

1075
01:25:51,631 --> 01:25:54,091
Good.
Listen, we identified
the tire tracks left

1076
01:25:54,175 --> 01:25:56,553
when Lounds was delivered
back to the Tattler.

1077
01:25:56,637 --> 01:25:59,055
G-7816 Goodyear truck tires.

1078
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,224
Looks like our
boy drives a van.

1079
01:26:01,308 --> 01:26:03,184
I'm setting up
our base in Chicago.

1080
01:26:03,269 --> 01:26:04,394
When are you coming back?

1081
01:26:04,478 --> 01:26:06,271
When I'm done, Jack.

1082

(PHONE RINGING)

1083
01:26:22,788 --> 01:26:24,497
Yeah, this is Will
Graham of the FBI.

1084
01:26:24,582 --> 01:26:27,876
Dr. Chilton arranged for me
to talk to Dr. Lecktor.

1085
01:26:32,423 --> 01:26:33,423
Hello?

1086
01:26:35,885 --> 01:26:37,093
LECKTOR: Hello, Will.

1087
01:26:37,845 --> 01:26:40,430
I wanted to congratulate
you for the job
you did on Mr. Lounds.

1088
01:26:40,514 --> 01:26:42,473
I admire that enormously.

1089
01:26:42,558 --> 01:26:44,726
Oh, what a cunning
boy you are.

1090
01:26:45,436 --> 01:26:47,187
I'm sick of you
crazy sons of bitches.

1091
01:26:47,271 --> 01:26:49,230
You got something
to say, say it.

1092
01:26:49,315 --> 01:26:50,773
I want to help you.

1093
01:26:51,775 --> 01:26:54,027
You'd be more comfortable
if you relax with yourself.

1094
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:56,321
We don't invent our natures,
they're issued to us,

1095
01:26:56,405 --> 01:26:59,699
along with our lungs
and pancreas
and everything else.

1096
01:27:00,492 --> 01:27:01,951
Why fight it?

1097
01:27:02,953 --> 01:27:04,204
Fight what?

1098
01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:06,039
Did you really
feel so depressed

1099
01:27:06,123 --> 01:27:09,500
after you shot
Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs
to death?

1100
01:27:09,919 --> 01:27:13,338
I didn't know you then,
but I think you probably did.

1101
01:27:13,422 --> 01:27:15,924
But it wasn't the act
that got you down, was it?

1102
01:27:16,008 --> 01:27:18,927
Didn't you really feel
so bad because killing
him felt so good?

1103
01:27:19,011 --> 01:27:21,012
And why shouldn't
it feel good?

1104
01:27:21,805 --> 01:27:25,225
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.

1105
01:27:26,477 --> 01:27:27,894
God's terrific.

1106
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,730
He dropped a church roof
on 34 of his worshippers

1107
01:27:30,814 --> 01:27:32,398
last Wednesday night
in Texas

1108
01:27:32,483 --> 01:27:35,610
as they were groveling
through a hymn
to his majesty.

1109
01:27:35,986 --> 01:27:38,238
Don't you think
that felt good?

1110
01:27:42,326 --> 01:27:44,494
Why does it feel good,
Dr. Lecktor?

1111
01:27:45,621 --> 01:27:48,873
It feels good, Will,
because God has power.

1112
01:27:50,167 --> 01:27:53,378
And if one does what
God does enough times,

1113
01:27:53,712 --> 01:27:57,006
one will become as God is.

1114
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:05,014
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.

1115
01:28:05,516 --> 01:28:09,352
He got 140 Filipinos
in one plane crash last month.

1116
01:28:09,436 --> 01:28:12,355
Remember that earthquake
in Italy last spring?

1117
01:28:15,943 --> 01:28:17,278

01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:23,075
The glass cutter.

1119
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:25,786
The piece of glass
I take out is mine.

1120
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,538
The house is mine.

1121
01:28:36,965 --> 01:28:38,841
I walk up these stairs,

1122
01:28:39,884 --> 01:28:41,760
I pass the children's toys.

1123
01:28:42,929 --> 01:28:44,972
The children mean
nothing to me.

1124
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:47,850
They were put
here to help me.

1125
01:28:52,063 --> 01:28:53,772
I move to the door.

1126
01:28:58,069 --> 01:28:59,903
I step into the room.

1127
01:29:04,451 --> 01:29:06,076
I see you there.

1128
01:29:09,581 --> 01:29:11,874
And I see me desired by you.

1129
01:29:14,419 --> 01:29:18,464
Accepted and loved

01:29:19,507 --> 01:29:22,509
in the silver mirrors

1131

to Fogel tomorrow...

Your pain has lasted
far too long

1153

Yeah.

No,

not Francis.

So, what are we doing?

1177

The dream.

1178
01:32:55,307 --> 01:32:58,018
He dreams about
being wanted and desired,

1179
01:32:58,478 --> 01:33:02,064
so he changes
people into beings
who want and desire him.

1180
01:33:02,732 --> 01:33:03,774
Changes?

1181
01:33:03,858 --> 01:33:05,317
It's a word.

1182
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:08,821
Killing and arranging
the people to imitate it.

1183
01:33:10,532 --> 01:33:12,783
And Lecktor
told me something.

1184
01:33:12,867 --> 01:33:15,369
If one does what
God does enough times,

1185
01:33:15,453 --> 01:33:17,496
one will become as God is.

1186
01:33:18,331 --> 01:33:20,124
You put it together,
you get,

1187
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:24,753
if our boy
imitates being wanted
and desired enough times,

1188
01:33:24,838 --> 01:33:26,714
he believes
he will become one

1189
01:33:26,798 --> 01:33:29,174
who is wanted
and desired and accepted.

1190
01:33:29,676 --> 01:33:31,510
It'll all come true.

1191
01:33:32,012 --> 01:33:34,930
This started
from an abused kid,

1192
01:33:35,181 --> 01:33:36,890
a battered infant.

1193
01:33:38,393 --> 01:33:40,936
There's something
terrible about...

1194
01:33:41,062 --> 01:33:43,689
JACK: What,
are you sympathizing
with this guy now?

1195
01:33:45,692 --> 01:33:47,443
Absolutely.

1196
01:33:47,527 --> 01:33:49,236
My heart bleeds
for him as a child.

1197
01:33:49,738 --> 01:33:52,364
Someone took a kid
and manufactured a monster.

1198
01:33:52,532 --> 01:33:55,868
At the same time,
as an adult,
he's irredeemable.

1199
01:33:56,578 --> 01:33:59,455
He butchers whole families
to pursue trivial fantasies.

1200
01:33:59,539 --> 01:34:03,584
As an adult, someone
should blow this sick
fuck out of his socks.

1201
01:34:08,214 --> 01:34:11,050
Do you think that's
a contradiction, Jack?

1202
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:15,763
Does this kind
of understanding
make you uncomfortable?

1203
01:34:28,777 --> 01:34:30,569
What about the mirrors?

1204
01:34:32,947 --> 01:34:35,574
He uses the mirrors
to see it happen.

1205
01:34:37,577 --> 01:34:39,828
But he doesn't take anything.

1206
01:34:40,872 --> 01:34:42,498
There's no souvenirs
taken from the houses.

1207
01:34:42,582 --> 01:34:45,626
He needs souvenirs
or trophies
to re-live the event.

1208
01:34:50,006 --> 01:34:52,174

1209

accepted over

how he found them,
we'll find him.

in a lottery,

and design in his choices.

four, five and six. Right?

and I'd do it again!

1238

What's that?

1239
01:36:35,362 --> 01:36:36,946
He used a bolt cutter
to trim away the branch

1240
01:36:37,031 --> 01:36:38,698
when he was watching
from the woods.

1241
01:36:38,783 --> 01:36:40,950
Why didn't he use
the bolt cutter
on the garage door?

1242
01:36:41,035 --> 01:36:44,329
Because a deadbolt was there
when they were killed.

1243
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:51,211
Donald Jacobi's
12th birthday party
was April 14th.

1244
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,798
Sometime between
April 14th and August 1
they changed the lock.

1245
01:36:54,882 --> 01:36:57,342
But he thought there
was a padlock there.

1246
01:37:05,017 --> 01:37:08,895
From the street,
you can't see the glass
in the Leeds' kitchen door.

1247
01:37:08,979 --> 01:37:10,730
There's a big,
high fence there.

1248
01:37:10,815 --> 01:37:13,399
But he was ready
with his glass cutter.

1249
01:37:15,236 --> 01:37:18,238
So either he was
casing far ahead

1250
01:37:19,073 --> 01:37:22,242
and we didn't
check back far enough,

1251
01:37:24,286 --> 01:37:25,537
