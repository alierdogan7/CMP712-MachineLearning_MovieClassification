00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,800
SOME PEOPLE LACK VISION.

179
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
PROBABLY EVERYBODY
IN CELL BLOCK E.

180
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
THAT'S $500.

181
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
GUYS, WHAT'S THE FIRST
LESSON IN POKER?

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,500
NEVER BET ON THE--
NO.

183
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
LEAVE EMOTION
AT THE DOOR.

184
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,300
THAT'S RIGHT, TOPHER.

185
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,800
TODAY'S LESSON--
HOW TO DRAW OUT THE BLUFF.

186
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,200
THAT MUCH MONEY
THIS EARLY IN THE GAME,

187
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
I'M SAYING HE'S HOLDING

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
NOTHING BETTER THAN
A PAIR OF FACE CARDS.

189
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,400
BARR?

190
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,800
[SIGHS] ALL RIGHT.

191
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
EH, I FOLD.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
JOSH?
NO. I'M GAME.

193
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
I WILL SEE YOUR 500,

194
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,800
AND I WILL RAISE YOU
ANOTHER 500 OF MY OWN.

195
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,100
THAT'S A VERY
HANDSOME BET, JOSH,

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
BUT BE CAREFUL.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH HIM
TOO HIGH TOO FAST.

198
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,400
WANT TO KEEP HIM
ON THE LEASH.

199
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,300
HOLLY?

200
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
CALL.
CALL?

201
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100

I'LL SEE YOU 500,

204
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,900
RAISE YOU 2,000.

205
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
[WHISTLES]

206
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,700
GUYS, YOU'RE FREE
TO DO WHAT YOU LIKE.

207
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,200
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY,
BUT I'M STAYING IN.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
HE'S TRYING TO BUY
HIS WAY OUT OF HIS BLUFF.

209
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,800
JOSH?

210
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,300

211
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,100

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THAT A GIRL. CALL.

213
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,900
CALL.

214
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,400
CALL.

215
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
LET'S SEE 'EM.

216
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT THE FOUR 9s DOES,

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
BUT THE ACE, I THINK,
IS PRETTY HIGH.

218
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,400
DUDE! THANKS FOR THE TIP
ON CALLING OUT THE BLUFF.

219
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,700
[ALL TALKING]

220
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
GOD, I'M BORED.

221
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
YOU LOOK BORED.

222
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
I AM BORED.
[SIGHS]

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
SO, HOW WAS THE CLINK?
DID YOU GET THE COOKIES I SENT?

224
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
WHY DO YOU THINK
I CAME TO SEE YOU FIRST?

225
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
SO, TELL ME.

226
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
IT'S TRICKY. IT'S
NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
IT'S GONNA NEED PLANNING
AND A LARGE CREW.

228
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
GUNS?

229
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
NOT EXACTLY.
A LOT OF SECURITY,

230
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
BUT THE TAKE--

231
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
WHAT'S THE TARGET?

232
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
8 FIGURES EACH.

233
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
WHAT'S THE TARGET?

234
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,900
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE IN VEGAS?

235
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
WHAT? YOU WANT TO
KNOCK OVER A CASINO?

236
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
OH! HO HO.

237
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Ocean: THE VAULT
AT THE BELLAGIO.

238
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,100
Rusty: MMM.

239
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
OOF!

240
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
WELL?

241
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,900
IF I'M READING
THIS RIGHT,

242
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
AND I'D LIKE TO
THINK THAT I AM,

243
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,300
THIS IS PROBABLY

244
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
THE LEAST ACCESSIBLE
VAULT EVER DESIGNED.

245
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
YEP.

246
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
YOU SAID 3 CASINOS?

247
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,000
THESE FEED INTO THE CAGES
AT THE MIRAGE,

248
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,900
THE MGM GRAND, BUT
EVERY DIME ENDS UP THERE.

249
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
THE BELLAGIO
AND THE MIRAGE.

250
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
THESE ARE TERRY
BENEDICT'S PLACES.

251
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
YES, THEY ARE.

252
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,400
DO YOU THINK
HE'LL MIND?

253
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,300
MORE THAN SOMEWHAT. YOU'D
NEED AT LEAST A DOZEN GUYS

254
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,700
DOING A COMBINATION OF CONS.

255
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

256
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD,
I'D SAY YOU'RE LOOKING

257
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,900
AT A BOESKY, A JIM BROWN,
A MISS DAISY,

258
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
2 JETHROS,
AND A LEON SPINKS,

259
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,700
NOT TO MENTION THE BIGGEST
ELLA FITZGERALD EVER.

260
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET
THE MONEY TO BACK THIS?

261
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,400
IF WE'RE HITTING
THESE 3 CASINOS,

262
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
WE'LL GET
OUR BANKROLL.

263
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,300
BENEDICT'S GOT
A LONG LIST OF ENEMIES.

264
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
YEAH, BUT ENEMIES WITH
LOOSE CASH, NOTHING TO LOSE?

265
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,000
AH! REUBEN.

266
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800

268
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,200
JESUS! OSCAR, LOWER IT
A BIT, WOULD YOU?

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,600
SORRY. YOU GUYS

00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,900
FIND WHAT YOU WANT?

271
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
YEAH. WE JUST WANT TO TAKE
THESE HOME FOR THE NIGHT

272
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,400
AND MAKE SOME COPIES,
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT.

273
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Oscar:
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

274
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
APPRECIATE IT.

275
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,000
WHAT?

276
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,400
WHA--
I NEED THE REASON.

277
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,200
DON'T SAY MONEY.
WHY DO THIS?

278
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,600
WHY NOT DO IT?

279
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
BECAUSE YESTERDAY,

280
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
I WALKED
OUT OF THE JOINT

281
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,800
AFTER LOSING
4 YEARS OF MY LIFE,

282
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,700
AND YOU'RE COLD-DECKING
TEEN BEATCOVER BOYS.

283
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
BECAUSE THE HOUSE
ALWAYS WINS.

284
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,400
PLAY LONG ENOUGH,

285
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
YOU NEVER
CHANGE THE STAKES,

286
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
THE HOUSE TAKES YOU
UNLESS...

287
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,700
WHEN THAT PERFECT
HAND COMES ALONG,

288
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
YOU BET BIG,

289
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
AND THEN
YOU TAKE THE HOUSE.

290
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
YOU'VE BEEN PRACTICING
THIS SPEECH, HAVEN'T YOU?

291
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,800
A LITTLE BIT. DID I RUSH?
IT FELT LIKE I RUSHED IT.

292
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,800
NO. IT WAS GOOD. I LIKED IT.
TEEN BEATTHING WAS HARSH.

293
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I WONDER WHAT
REUBEN'LL SAY.

294
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,400
YOU'RE OUT OF
YOUR GODDAMN MINDS!

295
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,300
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
YOU'RE, BOTH OF YOU, NUTS.

296
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,600
I KNOW MORE
ABOUT CASINO SECURITY

297
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
THAN ANY MAN ALIVE.
I INVENTED IT,

298
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
AND IT CANNOT BE BEATEN.

299
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
THEY GOT CAMERAS, THEY GOT
WATCHERS, THEY GOT LOCKS,

300
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
THEY GOT TIMERS,
THEY GOT VAULTS.

301
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,100
THEY GOT ENOUGH ARMED
PERSONNEL TO OCCUPY PARIS.

302
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
OK, BAD EXAMPLE.

303
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
IT'S NEVER BEEN TRIED.

304
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
HO HO!
IT'S NEVER BEEN TRIED.

305
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
IT'S BEEN TRIED.
A FEW GUYS EVEN CAME CLOSE.

306
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
YOU KNOW THE
3 MOST SUCCESSFUL ROBBERIES

307
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
IN THE HISTORY OF VEGAS?

308
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,300

Man: HEY, HEY!
GET THAT GUY--BROWN SUIT!

311
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
HE GOT 2 STEPS
CLOSER TO THE DOOR

312
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,000
THAN ANY LIVING SOUL
BEFORE HIM.

313
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
HEY! LEAVE
THE MONEY!

314
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
SECOND MOST SUCCESSFUL
ROBBERY--

315
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
THE FLAMINGO IN '71.

316
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,700
THIS GUY ACTUALLY
TASTED FRESH OXYGEN

317
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
BEFORE THEY GRABBED HIM.

318
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
UHH!

319
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000

BREATHING OUT OF A HOSE

320
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
FOR THE NEXT 3 WEEKS.

321
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
GODDAMN HIPPIE.

322
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,700
AND THE CLOSEST
ANY MAN HAS EVER COME

323
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
TO ROBBING
A LAS VEGAS CASINO

324
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,500
WAS OUTSIDE OF CAESAR'S
IN '87.

325
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,300
HE CAME, HE GRABBED,

326
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,600
THEY CONQUERED.

327
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,100
dd TAKE MY BREATH AWAY dd

328
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,300
BUT WHAT AM I SAYING?

329
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
YOU GUYS ARE PROS--
THE BEST!

330
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,100
I'M SURE YOU CAN MAKE IT
OUT OF THE CASINO.

331
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,500
OF COURSE, LEST WE FORGET,

332
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,400
ONCE YOU'RE
OUT THE FRONT DOOR,

333
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,300
YOU'RE STILL IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE FUCKIN' DESERT!

334
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,700
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT.

335
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,100
REUBEN, YOU'RE RIGHT.

336
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,500
OUR EYES ARE BIGGER
THAN OUR STOMACHS.

337
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,400
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS--PURE EGO.

338
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,900
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

339
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
THANK YOU FOR LUNCH.

340
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
BE SWELL.
IT WAS DELICIOUS.

341
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
SORRY WE
BOTHERED YOU.

342
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,600
LOOK, WE ALL GO WAY BACK,

343
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
AND, UH, I OWE YOU
FROM THE THING

344
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
WITH THE GUY IN THE PLACE,
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

345
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
THAT WAS
OUR PLEASURE.

346
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
I'D NEVER BEEN
TO BELIZE.

347
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,300
GIVE DOMINIC YOUR ADDRESSES.
I GOT SOME

348
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,700
REMAINDERED FURNITURE
I WANT TO SEND YOU.

349
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
LOOK, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
WHICH CASINOS DID YOU

528
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
DO YOU THINK
WE NEED ONE MORE?

OH, HE DIDN'T TELL YOU.

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
HE DIDN'T WANT ME
TRADING ON HIS NAME.

544
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
IF YOU DO THIS JOB,

[CHANGES SLIDES]

IT'S LOCATED BELOW THE STRIP
BENEATH 200 FEET OF SOLID EARTH.

STIPULATES THAT A CASINO
MUST HOLD IN RESERVE

648

ENOUGH CASH TO COVER
EVERY CHIP AT PLAY ON ITS FLOOR.

649
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,700
THAT MEANS,
ON A WEEKDAY, BY LAW,

650
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,700
IT HAS TO CARRY ANYWHERE
BETWEEN 60 AND $70 MILLION

00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,500
WE'RE GONNA THROW THE SWITCH

700
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
BASHER, IT'S YOUR SHOW.

701
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Basher: YOU WANT BROKE,
BLIND, OR BEDLAM?

702
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
Ocean: HOW ABOUT ALL 3?

703
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,700
RIGHT. IT'S DONE.

704
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
THIRD TASK--SURVEILLANCE.

705
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,600
CASINO SECURITY HAS AN EYE
AND AN EAR ON EVERYTHING,

706
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,500
SO WE WANT AN EYE
AND AN EAR ON THEM.

707
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
LIVINGSTON?

708
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,900
WELL, IT'S NOT THE LEAST
ACCESSIBLE SYSTEM

709
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,300
I'VE SEEN,
BUT IT'S CLOSE.

710
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,700
I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY HAVE
A CLOSED CIRCUIT FEED

711
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,600
I COULD TAP INTO?

712
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
NO.

713
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
THEN IT'S DEFINITELY
A BLACK-BAG JOB.

714
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,400
DO THEY EMPLOY AN
IN-HOUSE TECHNICIAN?

715
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,300

LONELY.

716
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600

730
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,000
"OBSEQUIOUS" IS A WORD.

I'M SORRY?

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,500
I TRIED ALL SORTS OF BRAND

790
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,900
I EVEN WENT FRAGRANCE-FREE
FOR A WHOLE YEAR.

SUNSCREEN IN IT.

YEAH, AND IDEALLY SPEAKING,
YOU ALMOST SHOULD WEAR GLOVES

794
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,400
WHEN YOU GOING TO BED.
BUT I FOUND OUT

795
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,300
THAT THERE WOULD BE
A LITTLE INTERFERENCE

796
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,300
IN MY...SOCIAL AGENDA,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

797

PLUS I CAN GET A REACTION
FROM THE CAMPHOR,

799
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,500

00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,600
THIS GUY IS AS SMART
AS HE IS RUTHLESS.

872
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,000
THE LAST GUY THEY CAUGHT
CHEATING IN HERE,

873
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
HE NOT ONLY SENT HIM UP
FOR 10 YEARS,

874
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
BUT HE HAD THE BANK
SEIZE HIS HOUSE,

875
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,300
AND THEN
HE BANKRUPTED--

876
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW'S
TRACTOR DEALERSHIP. I HEARD.

877
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,600
HE DOESN'T JUST
TAKE OUT YOUR KNEES.

878
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
THE GUY GOES AFTER
YOUR LIVELIHOOD

879
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
AND THE LIVELIHOOD
OF ANYBODY YOU EVER MET.

880
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,500
YOU SCARED?

881
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,900
YOU SUICIDAL?

882
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,300
ONLY IN THE MORNING.

883
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,700
NOW WHAT?

884
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,200
NOW COMES A GIRL.

885
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,100
SHE COMES DOWN AFTER HIM
IF THEY'RE IN A SNIT.

886
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
WHERE'S SHE
COME FROM?

887
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,900
MUSEUM UP THERE.
SHE'S A CURATOR.

888
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,300
OH. HERE SHE IS.

889
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,700
THIS IS JUST
THE BEST PART OF MY DAY.

890
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
I STILL DON'T KNOW
IF WE CAN USE HER YET.

891
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T
EVEN CAUGHT HER NAME.

892
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,900
TESS.

893
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
HUH?

894
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
HER NAME IS TESS.

895
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,800
WE HAVE TO TALK.

896
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,200
OK.
NOW.

897
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,900
TELL ME
THIS IS NOT ABOUT HER,

898
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
OR I AM WALKING.

899
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,300
I AM WALKING
OFF THIS JOB RIGHT NOW.

900
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,200
WHO?

901
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,700
TESS. TERRY BENEDICT.

902
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,600
TELL ME
THIS IS NOT ABOUT

903
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
SCREWING THE GUY THAT'S
SCREWING YOUR WIFE.

904
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
EX-WIFE.
TELL ME.

905
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,900
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

906
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY
ABOUT THAT.

907
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,700
RUSS, DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE
FIRST GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS?

908
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,600
WE SAID WE WERE
GONNA PLAY THE GAME

909
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
LIKE WE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE.

910
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,400
WELL, I LOST SOMETHING.

911
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,300
I LOST SOMEONE.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

912
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
[EXHALES]

913
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,400
OK, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

914
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,400
NOW WE'RE
STEALING 2 THINGS.

915
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,300
AND WHEN
PUSH COMES TO SHOVE,

916
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,700
IF YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH,
WHICH ARE YOU GONNA CHOOSE?

917
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,600
AND REMEMBER,
TESS DOES NOT SPLIT 11 WAYS.

918
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
IF EVERYTHING GOES TO PLAN,

919
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,400
THEN I WON'T BE THE ONE
THAT HAS TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.

920
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,700
HOW'D SHE LOOK?

921
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,100
SHE LOOKED GOOD.

922
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,600
THANKS.

923
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,100
[INAUDIBLE]

924
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
YOU LIKE IT?

925
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
I LIKE THAT
YOU LIKE IT.

926
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,400
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT?

927
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,800
OK.

928
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,500
IN MY HOTELS,

929
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,000
THERE'S ALWAYS
SOMEBODY WATCHING.

930
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,200
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

931
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,600
Man: A WEAK STOMACH,
MR. ZERGA?

932
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,500
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN WEAKNESS.

933
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
IT COSTS TOO MUCH.

934
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,300
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN QUESTIONS, EITHER.

935
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,700
OH, REALLY?

936
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,600
WELL, LET ME
GIVE YOU A TIP.

937
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,500
I WOULDN'T GET
INTO TERRY BENEDICT

938
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,500
FOR TOO MUCH MONEY.

939
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,900
HE DOESN'T FOOL
AROUND.

940
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,800
MORNING,
EDDIE.

941
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,800
MORNING, SIR.

942
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,300
ANYTHING FOR ME?

943
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,300
MR. ZERGA, LYMAN ZERGA,
IN THE THIRD POSITION,

944
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,600
WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU
PRIVATELY.

945
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
WHO IS HE?

946
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,400
BUSINESSMAN OF SOME KIND,
WORKING MOSTLY IN EUROPE.

947
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,300
VERY VAGUE.
BUT I ASKED AROUND.

948
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,200
WORD IS HE DEALS
PRIMARILY IN ARMS--

949
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,100
ONE OF THE BIGGEST.

950
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,000
ZERGA.

951
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
YES, SIR.

952
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,900
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

953
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,400
THAT'S WHY
I DON'T DOUBT IT.

954
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,800
HE STAYING HERE?

955
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,700
CHECKED IN 2 NIGHTS AGO.
HE'S IN THE MIRADOR SUITE.

956
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,100
HOW'S HE DOING?

957
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,500
UP. ALMOST 200.

958
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,400
GOOD FOR HIM.

959
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,800
YOU'RE 30 SECONDS LATE.

960
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,300
I WAS ABOUT TO SEND OUT
A SEARCH--

961
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,600
HELLO, TESS.

962
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

963
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,400
I'M OUT.

964
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,300
YOU'RE OUT.
OF PRISON.

965
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,300
YOU REMEMBER THE DAY
THAT I WENT FOR CIGARETTES

966
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,200
AND I DIDN'T COME BACK?
YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED.

967
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,600
I DON'T SMOKE.
DON'T SIT.

968
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,500
AHH. NOW, THEY TELL ME
THAT I PAID MY DEBT TO SOCIETY.

969
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,900
FUNNY,
I NEVER GOT A CHECK.

970
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,800
YOU'RE NOT WEARING
YOUR RING.

971
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,100
I SOLD IT. I DON'T
HAVE A HUSBAND,

972
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
OR DIDN'T YOU
GET THE PAPERS?

973
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
MY LAST DAY INSIDE.

974
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,900
I TOLD YOU I'D WRITE.

975
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,700
DANNY...GO NOW, BEFORE--

976
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,100
WHAT? BENEDICT?

977
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
HOW YOU DOING?

978
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,900
WHISKEY,
AND A WHISKEY.

979
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,300
DANNY--

980
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,300
TESS, YOU'RE
DOING A GREAT JOB

981
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,700
CURATING THE MUSEUM.

982
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
THE VERMEER IS QUITE GOOD.
IT'S SIMPLE, VIBRANT,

983
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,000
ALTHOUGH HIS WORK DEFINITELY
FELL OFF AS HE GOT OLDER.

984
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
REMIND YOU
OF ANYONE?

985
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,400
AND I ALWAYS CONFUSE
MONET AND MANET.

986
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,300
NOW, WHICH ONE
MARRIED HIS MISTRESS?

987
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,700
MONET.

988
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,600
RIGHT. AND THEN
MANET HAD SYPHILIS.

989
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
THEY ALSO PAINTED
OCCASIONALLY.

990
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,300
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

991
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,700
I CAME HERE FOR YOU.

992
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
I WANNA
GET ON WITH MY LIFE.

993
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
I WANT YOU WITH ME.

994
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,900
YOU'RE A THIEF
AND A LIAR.

995
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
I ONLY LIED
ABOUT BEING A THIEF.

996
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,700
I DON'T DO THAT
ANYMORE.

997
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,600
STEAL?
LIE.

998
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,100
I'M WITH SOMEONE NOW

999
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,500
WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE
THAT KIND OF DISTINCTION.

1000
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,900
NO, HE'S
VERY CLEAR ON BOTH.

1001
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,300
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

1002
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,700
I ONLY HAVE ONE?

1003
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,700
YOU'VE MET TOO MANY
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

1004
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,100
I'M WITH TERRY NOW.

1005
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,800
DOES HE MAKE YOU LAUGH?

1006
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,200
HE DOESN'T
MAKE ME CRY.

1007
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,200
Saul: MR. BENEDICT,

1008
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,600
THE FIGHT IS SATURDAY
NIGHT, IS IT NOT?

1009
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,000
YES. WOULD YOU
LIKE SOME TICKETS?

1010
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,900
NO. HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT
DOES NOT INTEREST ME.

1011
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,800
I HAVE A PACKAGE
ARRIVING HERE THAT EVENING,

1012
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,600
BLACK BRIEFCASE,
STANDARD SIZE,

1013
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,500
THE CONTENTS OF WHICH
IS VERY VALUABLE TO ME.

1014
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
I'LL PUT IT
IN THE HOUSE SAFE FOR YOU.

1015
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,700
THE HOUSE SAFE
IS FOR BRANDY

1016
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,100
AND GRANDMOTHERS'
PEARLS.

1017
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,500
I NEED SOMETHING
MORE SECURE.

1018
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,900
MR. ZERGA,
I CAN ASSURE YOU

1019
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,300
THAT OUR HOUSE SAFE--

1020
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,300
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU,
MR. BENEDICT,

1021
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,200
THAT YOUR GENEROSITY
IN THIS MANNER

1022
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,600
WILL NOT
GO OVERLOOKED.

1023
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,000
NOW...WHAT CAN YOU
OFFER ME

1024
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,300
BESIDES THE SAFE?

1025
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,200
SEE, THE PEOPLE
YOU STEAL THINGS FROM?

1026
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,100
THEY HAVE INSURANCE
TO COMPENSATE THEM.

1027
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
THEY GET
MADE WHOLE AGAIN.

1028
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
I HAD TO LEAVE NEW YORK
TO GET AWAY FROM WHAT HAPPENED.

1029
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
HOW AM I GONNA GET
MY 5 YEARS BACK, DANNY?

1030
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,800
YOU CAN'T.

1031
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,700
BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS
NOT THROW AWAY ANOTHER--

1032
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,200
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW ANY--

1033
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,100
TESS, ALL RIGHT.

1034
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,600
YOU DON'T LOVE ME
ANYMORE.

1035
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,000
YOU WANT TO MAKE A LIFE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE, FINE.

1036
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO LIVE WITH THAT.

1037
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,900
BUT NOT HIM.

1038
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,800
SPOKEN LIKE
A TRUE EX-HUSBAND.

1039
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,200
I'M NOT JOKING, TESS.

1040
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,200
I'M NOT LAUGHING, DANNY.

1041
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,100
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THERE IS
A BIT OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST

1042
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
WHEN YOU GIVE ME ADVICE
ABOUT MY LOVE LIFE.

1043
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,400
YES, BUT THAT DOESN'T

Policeman:

HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

1924
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,500
I'M NOT SURE
THESE BELONG TO ME.

1930
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,200
