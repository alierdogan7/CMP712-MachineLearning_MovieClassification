1
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:55,086
Happy Thanksgiving!

2
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:04,237
- Here!
- Right here!

3
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,879
Here you go, fellas!

4
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,719
Come! Come here.

5
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,658
This is the problem.

6
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:39,557
This is what's wrong with America.

7
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,635
It's gotten so big

8
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:43,891
you just can't find your way.

9
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,792
The grocery store

10
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:48,233
on the corner is a now a supermarket.

11
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:49,548
The candy store

12
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:51,709
is a MacDonald's.

13
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:54,109
And this place...

14
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:57,225
a super fucking discount store.

15
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:59,479
Where's the pride of ownership?

16
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:03,378
Where's the personal service?

17
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,163
See what I mean?

18
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,656
Shit...

19
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,592
What right do they have

20
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,642
of cutting out the suppliers?

21
00:03:20,278 --> 00:03:22,706
Pushing out all the middlemen.

22
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,106
Buying direct from the manufacturer.

23
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:29,743
Sony this.

24
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,592
Toshiba that.

25
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,750
All them Chinks...

26
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:36,022
put Americans out of work.

27
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,348
<i>...plans to take place
in Quang Tri Province.</i>

28
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,635
<i>From Laos...</i>

29
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,396
That's the way it is now.

30
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,437
You're all right ?

31
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,443
You can't find the heart of anything...

32
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,020
to stick the knife.

33
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,612
Anybody here?

34
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,037
- Can I help you?
- Call an ambulance.

35
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:07,552
Forget it, Frank.

36
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,718
There's no one in charge.

37
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,437
Call an ambulance!

38
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,148
<i>Some say Bumpy Johnson
was a great man,</i>

39
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,312
<i>according to eulogies,
a giving man.</i>

40
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:26,710
<i>A man of the people.
No one chose to use</i>

41
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,283
<i>in remembrances
the word most often associated</i>

42
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,684
<i>with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson :
Gangster,</i>

43
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:34,183
<i>whose passing has brought
a Who's Who of mourners</i>

44
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,636
<i>on this chilly afternoon.</i>

45
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:37,870
<i>The KC mob boss,
Dominic Cattano.</i>

46
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:40,208
<i>Harlem crime figure,
Nicky Barnes.</i>

47
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:42,175
<i>From the political arena,</i>

48
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:44,476
<i>the Governor has come down.
The Mayor of New York,</i>

49
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,572
<i>the Chief of Police and Commissioner.</i>

50
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:48,532
<i>Sports and entertainment luminaries.</i>

51
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:52,132
<i>Bumpy Johnson,
age 62 when he passed</i>

52
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:55,725
<i>was a folk hero among Harlem locals
for over four decades.</i>

53
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:58,584
<i>Regarded by some as
the Robin Hood of Harlem,</i>

54
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:01,033
<i>by others as a ruthless criminal.</i>

55
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:05,040
I would've thought that Warnfield
put out a better spread.

56
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:08,792
- Want some ?
- No, thanks.

57
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:11,028
I want chicken wings on mine.

58
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:12,858
Who is that ?

59
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,903
He didn't know what hit him.

60
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,780
I just kept poppin'
him in the face.

61
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,429
You got a light?

62
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:39,882
That's very good.

63
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:41,739
Hey, Frank !

64
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,657
Get me a light while you're at it.

65
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:49,432
Appreciate it.

66
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:51,952
Don Cattano.

67
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,911
How you doing, Rossi?

68
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,975
- Good.
- A drink, Sir?

69
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:58,410
Give him a scotch.

70
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,912
Come on.

71
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:17,846
I know you're hurting, Frank.

72
00:06:19,106 --> 00:06:20,123
So am I.

73
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:21,947
I'm all right.

74
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,426
- You going to be all right?
- Yeah.

75
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,459
I'm sure Bumpy didn't tell you,
but he made me promise

76
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:29,455
if anything happened to him...

77
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,071
I should make sure

78
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,856
that you're want for nothing.

79
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:35,660
I appreciate that.

80
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:39,765
Half the people here
owed Bumpy money when he died.

81
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:43,489
They think I'll forget to collect,
but I'll get that money.

82
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,571
Well... that's the spirit.

83
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:47,358
Go get them.

84
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:51,461
<i>Mr. Roberts!</i>

85
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,596
Taking the prosecution side,

86
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:55,377
give us U.S. vs. Meade,

87
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:58,137
subject, issues,
what the determination was

88
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,260
and what it means to us today.

89
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:02,674
Class shall be critiquing,

90
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,020
Mr. Roberts, so pay attention.

91
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,713
<i>I hate hearing my name,
ya know ?</i>

92
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,035
Means I gotta get up
in front of the class,

93
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:15,016
I gotta turn around,
and I know everyone in there,

94
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,836
they know more than I do.

95
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:18,952
The N°1 fear of people...

96
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,086
it ain't dying.
It's public speaking.

97
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,947
I get physically ill.
Wanna throw up.

98
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,777
And you wanna do that
for a living.

99
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:26,910
I don't like being like that.
I want to beat it.

100
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:29,303
- Should I do this?
- No, he'll take it from me.

101
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:30,802
He knows me since high shool.

102
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:32,684
- High school?
- Good morning.

103
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:34,901
He doesn't take it, just throw it in.

104
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:37,281
- That's good service.
- Throw it in?

105
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,004
- What's up, Suzie?
- Hi, Jay.

106
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:42,994
- How you doing, baby?
- All right.

107
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,741
You, punk !

108
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:14,460
You bit me, asshole !

109
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:18,294
I swear to God, Richie.
I didn't know it was you.

110
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,314
I'd never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.

111
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:22,711
You bit my fucking hand.

112
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,534
What you doing
serving subpoenas anyway?

113
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,585
- We're on loan to County.
- County?

114
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,981
- How's that working for you?
- Fuck you.

115
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,485
I'm sorry.
Consider me served.

116
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:33,049
Can we leave it there?

117
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:34,999
Assault on a police officer?

118
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,426
I don't think so.

119
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:39,891
For old time's sake, what can we do,
what do you want, what can I give you?

120
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:42,377
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?

121
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,194
- 5 years minimum.
- 5 years.

122
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,304
Guys, c'mon ! No.

123
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,517
Guys, what do you want?
Who do you want?

124
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,249
- Who do you got ?
- You want...

125
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:52,727
Big Al's bookie, his accountant?

126
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:54,911
I'll give him to you.

127
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:04,938
Stop, stop.

128
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:07,407
There he is.

129
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:11,913
That's him. The bookie.

130
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:13,834
All right. Get lost.

131
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,209
- Right here?
- Right here. Get out of the car.

132
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:17,722
- This is nuts.
- Come on.

133
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:19,013
Let's go.

134
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:20,993
Take it easy.

135
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:43,095
We stay with him or the car?

136
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,391
Let's see who comes for the car.

137
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:01,763
Think he made us?

138
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:05,002
You called in a warrant, right?
So where are they?

139
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:06,486
I just called, man!

140
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:10,302
I called and walked back here,
and ten seconds has gone by.

141
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,853
We saw him with the slips, Jay.

142
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,359
You saw policy slips?
You saw grocery bags.

143
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:19,841
- You don't know what's in them.
- I do, and so do you.

144
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:21,252
Don't give me that bull.

145
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:22,735
What's the rush, Richie?

146
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,158
- Half an hour, the warrant'll be here.
- I got night school.

147
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,972
Guess you're gonna miss it.

148
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,498
- Fuck this. Come on!
- You sure?

149
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,189
Yeah, let's go.

150
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:33,704
Fuck!

151
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:44,698
Fuck!

152
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:12,135
- It's not just a couple of bucks.
- It's the same thing, in principle.

153
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:14,763
We're talking principles?

154
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,161
A cop who turns in
this kind of money...

155
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:20,460
says one thing.
He turns in cops who take money.

156
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,472
- We'll be fucking pariahs.
- We're fucked both ways.

157
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:26,530
Not if we keep it. Only if we don't,
then right, we're fucked,

158
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:27,911
but not if we keep it.

159
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,909
Goddamn it, man!

160
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,291
Did we ask for it?
Did we put a gun to someone's head

161
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:34,928
and say : "Give us your money"?

162
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:37,366
Cops... kill cops

163
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:39,078
they can't trust.

164
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:43,729
We can't turn it in, man.

165
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:54,860
You believe that?

166
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:05,797
How much is there?

167
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,076
Nine hundred
and eighty seven thousand.

168
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,703
What happened to the rest?

169
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,410
What the hell are you doing counting it
in front of everybody. Are you nuts?

170
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,855
Get it back in the bags, seal'em up,
and down it to the property room.

171
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:36,269
Fucking boy-scouts.

172
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,809
So nice to see you here this evening.

173
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,604
What?

174
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:03,555
What?

175
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:28,976
Detective Trupo.
Sign here.

176
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:35,926
You guys ready
to make a lot of fuckin money?

177
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,713
- Always.
- Hell yeah.

178
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:43,345
Here you go!

179
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:45,478
All right. Look at this.

180
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,083
- Fucking dealers.
- Here's three more boats.

181
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,221
Hey, don't lose any of that shit.

182
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:00,317
- I know.
- Be careful.

183
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:06,328
Just enough for the reagent test.

184
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:09,319
A little less.

185
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:17,799
<i>This is the French Connection dope.</i>

186
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,880
<i>Kilos of the same dope Eddie Egan
and Sonny Grasso took from us!</i>

187
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,723
<i>The cops seize it, arrest everyone,</i>

188
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:27,200
<i>and they start taking it out
of the evidence room,</i>

189
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:30,498
<i>whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us.</i>

190
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:33,265
<i>They basically
control the market with it.</i>

191
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,439
Mr. Rossi.
A surprise.

192
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,139
<i>They've been doin this for years.
They live off it.</i>

193
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,817
<i>- Our dope.
- Many thanks.</i>

194
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,271
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?

195
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,104
Fuckin crooks.

196
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:46,893
Sad about Bumpy.

197
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:51,181
Things are never gonna be the same
in Harlem.

198
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,139
You walk down the street.

199
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:56,184
Nobody bothers you
cause Bumpy was making sure of it.

200
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:57,918
Here, Frankie.

201
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,257
How is it there now?

202
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:03,377
It's chaos.
Every gorilla for himself.

203
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,335
Who can live like that?

204
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:14,291
There has to be order.

205
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:16,453
That would've never happened
with Italians.

206
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:18,985
More important than
any one man's life...

207
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:20,820
is order.

208
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:29,648
Frank.

209
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:33,727
Come on in.
Sit down.

210
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:40,164
- How y'all doin?
- Good.

211
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:43,281
- So, you seen Nate over there?
- Yeah, all the time.

212
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,636
Nate is everywhere.

213
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:46,469
- He's good.
- He's still over there.

214
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,105
Got himself a club now.

215
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,740
Where, Saigon?

216
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:50,959
Bangkok.

217
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:52,900
I don't think he's ever comin home.

218
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:58,940
Come on.

219
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:28,235
On the house
for our boys in uniform.

220
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,686
Thank you, sugar,
that's very kind.

221
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:33,230
Thank Frank.

222
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,508
Thanks, Frank.

223
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:37,560
Just relax.

224
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:41,184
You gonna have to boot this,
shoot a couple times.

225
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:44,064
Cops keep cutting it.

226
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,946
Selling the shit.

227
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:50,945
I won't say anything
cause the price is right.

228
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:53,087
But that shit in Nam

229
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:54,674
is way...

230
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,694
way...

231
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:58,606
heavy...

232
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,024
Didn't you see the jar, Frank?

233
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:28,361
I think you walked right past it.

234
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,200
The money jar.
What I gotta do?

235
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:33,089
Put a fuckin sign on it?

236
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,517
What are you thinking?
You know,

237
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,054
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

238
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:44,903
He don't own no real estate
in Harlem right now. I'm the landlord,

239
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:46,669
and the lease is 20 %.

240
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:50,851
Well, don't sell dope then, Frank.

241
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:53,471
Get a real job.
Need a fuckin job, Frank?

242
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:56,246
Is that what you need?
You come work for me.

243
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,402
You can drive me around.
You open my doors.

244
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:03,770
Yes sir, no sir, right away sir.
Anything you want, Master Johnson.

245
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,481
20 %.

246
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,923
20 % is my profit, Tango.

247
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,525
I give you that, what do I got left?
Nothing.

248
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,719
20 % puts me and everyone you know
out of business.

249
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:28,484
There are legitimate ways
of doing things,

250
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,489
and there's this way.
Not even Bumpy took 20 %.

251
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:33,613
Bumpy's fuckin dead.

252
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:38,371
My man.

253
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,165
20 %?

254
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,326
20 %.

255
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:52,416
Doc! Let's go.

256
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,713
<i>The drug problem in Vietnam
is more</i>

257
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,525
<i>than marijuana.
At this point,</i>

258
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,416
<i>it is estimated that one third
of American troops are experimenting</i>

259
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:05,299
<i>with opium and heroin.</i>

260
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:07,948
<i>The authorities say they've confiscated</i>

261
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:11,564
<i>large quantities of marijuana,
heroin, and pills.</i>

262
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:14,619
<i>Every person and every vehicle
going through the gates</i>

263
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,009
<i>is subject to a thorough shakedown.</i>

264
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,991
<i>Soldiers have access to the drugs</i>

265
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:23,308
<i>at many rest and relaxation spots
in Bangkok, Saigon, and other areas</i>

266
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:25,236
<i>throughout Vietnam and Thailand.</i>

267
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:27,613
<i>Officials say the easy availability</i>

268
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,971
<i>of relatively cheap cost
of high purity heroin</i>

269
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,217
<i>throughout Saigon and the Far East</i>

270
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,664
<i>is leading to an epidemic
of heroin addiction</i>

271
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,451
<i>among U.S. soldiers.</i>

272
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:43,069
<i>- Operator.
- Yeah, international.</i>

273
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,310
<i>- What city?
- Bangkok.</i>

274
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:46,762
<i>You know the country code?</i>

275
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,123
Yeah, 376.

276
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,436
<i>- For the first 3 minutes, it'll...
- I got it, I got it.</i>

277
00:20:57,114 --> 00:20:58,562
<i>- Sawadeekap.
- Hello?</i>

278
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:00,416
<i>"Soul brothers".
Can I help you?</i>

279
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:01,497
Nate!

280
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,008
<i>- Do I know you?
- It's me.</i>

281
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:06,785
<i>- Who?
- Me, Frank! Your cousin, negro.</i>

282
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:12,457
Go get yourself a new suit.

283
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,268
Look, I'm sorry.

284
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,702
Please, Richie.

285
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:55,815
Couldn't be avoided.
I'll take him next weekend, OK?

286
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:58,003
We're moving.

287
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:00,205
What? Where?

288
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:03,603
The St. Regis.
What do you care?

289
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:08,071
My sister's.

290
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,095
Your sister's. In Vegas?

291
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:12,561
- Yeah.
- You're not moving to Las Vegas.

292
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:13,970
Not with Michael.

293
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:17,066
What am I supposed to do with him?
Leave him with you?

294
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:18,777
There's a picture.

295
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:20,881
Hey, guys!
Be cool.

296
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,934
Laurie, Las Vegas

297
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:26,970
is not the kind of place
to raise a kid.

298
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:28,781
Oh, like this is a good environment?

299
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:30,398
And around your friends?

300
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,288
When am I supposed to see my boy?

301
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,285
This weekend, last weekeend.

302
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:40,561
I asked you nice to shut up, right?

303
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:42,307
Now I'll have to kill you.
I swear

304
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:45,052
I'll pull out my gun
and put a bullet in your fuckin head!

305
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,113
Stop what you're doin,
and pick up the glass!

306
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:48,838
Calm down, man. Be cool.

307
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:53,983
He's fuckin crazy.

308
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:56,396
You don't have a gun.

309
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:00,819
You sure?

310
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:10,856
You're crazy, Richie.

311
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,967
You don't have room for us.

312
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,714
I'll see you in court.

313
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:23,809
Come on, Michael!

314
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:25,963
Say bye to your dad.

315
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,846
Hey, kiddo!

316
00:23:31,216 --> 00:23:33,470
See you next week.
We'll do something.

317
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:37,141
Let's get you an ice cream.

318
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:03,884
<i>You have 10 minutes remaining.</i>

319
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,316
10 minutes.

320
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:22,814
Girl, don't talk.
I wanna do a little funk.

321
00:26:00,787 --> 00:26:01,889
How much you want?

322
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,362
Tell him I want a 100 kis.

323
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,879
Ain't nobody I know
who can get you that much.

324
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:12,133
You have to piece it together
from different sources.

325
00:26:12,377 --> 00:26:14,001
And it's not gonna be 100 % pure.

326
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:16,218
I don't want that.

327
00:26:16,486 --> 00:26:18,054
I know what you don't want.

328
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:22,478
But you'll need to get
to the Chi-Chou syndicate, all right?

329
00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:25,480
In Cholon, Saigon.
If they'll deal with you at all.

330
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:28,063
I understand, but
by then, it'll be too late.

331
00:26:28,215 --> 00:26:30,785
It'll be already chopped up.
I want to get it where they get it from.

332
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:31,944
The source.

333
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,279
- And get it yourself?
- Why not?

334
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:37,553
I came this far.

335
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:40,866
- You'd go into the motherfuckin jungle?
- I'm in it. Look around,

336
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,998
They're eating these roaches,
whatever that is.

337
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,663
Nigga, I'm talking about snakes.

338
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:49,371
Tigers, Vietcongs, mosquitos
that'll fuckin kill your ass.

339
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:53,593
- You wanna go into the jungle?
- We're going.

340
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:58,043
- Fuck it, let's go.
- We're going.

341
00:26:58,186 --> 00:26:59,180
Why not?

342
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,267
Hey, Frank.

343
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,404
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang.

344
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,403
General Chang Kai Chek's
defeated army.

345
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:32,221
How would you get it into the States?

346
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,483
You ain't got to worry about that.

347
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:37,903
- Who do you work for in there?
- Don't worry about that either.

348
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:39,667
Who are you really?

349
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:42,897
Frank Lucas,
like it says on my passport.

350
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:45,634
- I mean, who you represent?
- Me.

351
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:51,904
You think you're going to take
a 100 kilos of heroin into the U.S.

352
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,332
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone's going to allow that?

353
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,410
That's right.

354
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,710
After this first purchase...

355
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:10,018
if you're not killed
by Marseilles importers...

356
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,918
or their people in the States...

357
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,626
then, what?

358
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:19,159
Then there'll be more, much more.
I guarantee you.

359
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:23,111
And if it's all the same to you, I don't
have to drag my ass here no more.

360
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:25,956
Of course not.

361
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,185
My man.

362
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:33,277
- Soul brothers?
- Soul brothers.

363
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:19,539
Fifty grand. It'll cover them,
the pilot and the boys on the other end.

364
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:22,223
Give them a hundred.

365
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:24,680
Fifty will cover it.

366
00:30:25,294 --> 00:30:27,466
Give them a hundred, the whole thing.

367
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:29,283
And look.

368
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:31,550
That's all I got.

369
00:30:31,703 --> 00:30:34,242
If that dope don't arrive,
for any reason...

370
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,021
Listen.

371
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:42,050
Cousin or no cousin,
I'm a busy man, all right?

372
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:44,616
I got no time to go
to nobody's funeral.

373
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,993
I'll let you know
when it's in the air.

374
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,635
My man.

375
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,921
<i>Richie?
Fuckin guy made me,</i>

376
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,052
don't know how he did,
but he did.

377
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:19,959
<i>He went for his gun!</i>

378
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,625
I had to do it, man!

379
00:31:21,782 --> 00:31:23,233
A hundred people out there heard

380
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,549
the shot. You gotta help me,
you gotta do something!

381
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:28,999
Where are you, Jay?

382
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:31,674
That's the problem.

383
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:36,733
Dispatch, I got a 10-13.

384
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:38,247
I got a 10-13.

385
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:40,445
<i>Copy that. What's your 20?</i>

386
00:31:41,228 --> 00:31:42,388
Tower 2.

387
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:45,532
Floor 1G.

388
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:48,482
Canton West, in the projects.

389
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:51,472
<i>- Identify yourself, please.
- Detective Richard Roberts.</i>

390
00:31:51,816 --> 00:31:54,158
<i>Negative, I got no units in that area.</i>

391
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:55,437
Bullshit.

392
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,526
Please put the call out again.
I'll need assistance.

393
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:02,130
<i>Det. Roberts, I got no units
in that area, that's a negative.</i>

394
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:31,684
Why you goin' thru, motherfucker?

395
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:34,430
Be cool!

396
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:36,079
Be cool, all right?

397
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,379
I'll find out what's going on in here.

398
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:48,479
Richie.

399
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,037
<i>Open the motherfuckin door!</i>

400
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:58,468
Where's your backup ?

401
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:01,879
You got no backup?
Why is that?

402
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:06,921
Bandage his neck.

403
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,701
- Richie, he's dead.
- I know he's fuckin dead, right?

404
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,527
Bandage his neck, clean up his head.
Prop him up on the gurney

405
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:14,663
so he's sittin,
and open his fuckin eyes.

406
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,343
- All right? Let's go!
- Fuck.

407
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:23,057
OK, clean him up.

408
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,666
Give me your gun.

409
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:36,993
Your gun!

410
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:41,425
You have your badge?

411
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,460
You guys ready?

412
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,434
Just keep moving forward.

413
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:49,780
- You all right?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,393
It's OK!

415
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,600
Injured man coming out.
Step back.

416
00:33:59,018 --> 00:34:00,845
Let them do their job.
He'll be all right.

417
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,453
Step back.

418
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:08,926
That's fine.
That's it.

419
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:12,655
He's alive.

420
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,258
What happened inside?

421
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:27,183
Thanks, man.

422
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,651
Fuck.

423
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:33,160
The asshole pulled a piece on me.
Can you fuckin believe it?

424
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:35,916
He pulls a piece on a cop?
Had to do it, man.

425
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,439
Kill or be killed.

426
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:40,118
Fuckin crazy world, right?

427
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:45,189
What the fuck were you doing
on the projects?

428
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:47,886
Investigating stuff, man,
you know.

429
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,327
Just like you taught me.

430
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,289
Checking on guys,
following things up,

431
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,135
putting the pieces together.

432
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,565
The guy was a fucking dealer.
Scum of the earth!

433
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,874
That guy
didn't pull a gun on a cop, Jay.

434
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,043
That guy pulled a gun on a junkie.

435
00:35:06,153 --> 00:35:07,630
The junkie was trying to rob him.

436
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,282
What the fuck you sayin?

437
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:12,821
What the fuck you doin, man?

438
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:15,231
- What the fuck is that?
- That money's mine, man!

439
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:17,164
I earned this shit!
It's mine!

440
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:19,050
I earned it doing good cop work.

441
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:21,760
- I got it doin good cop work!
- You murdered him!

442
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:24,054
- And gettin shot at!
- You murdered the guy!

443
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:26,791
You murdered him,
you robbed his money,

444
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,483
then you called me to get you out.

445
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:30,222
Makes me an accessory after the fact.

446
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,603
I'll tell you the facts,

447
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:34,264
just write the report
the way i see it happened.

448
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:36,248
And then that's the way it is.

449
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:38,351
And that's how it'll all be.

450
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:40,709
I can't do that.

451
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:45,604
I'm a leper because I listened to you
and turned in a million bucks.

452
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:47,715
No one will work with me after that.

453
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:51,041
I can give up this shit, Richie!

454
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,679
That's easy.

455
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:54,836
Just write the report.

456
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:56,461
Between us.

457
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,879
As partners.

458
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,841
I can't do that.

459
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:08,043
Stop!

460
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:49,064
Open the trunk.

461
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:14,716
<i>Get out!
Get out of Vietnam!</i>

462
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:21,222
<i>As loud as we can
that the Vietnam war should stop,</i>

463
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,477
<i>and that the best way to stop it
is for the United States</i>

464
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:27,988
<i>to simply pack up
and get out of Vietnam right now!</i>

465
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,943
How are we looking?

466
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:41,286
Typically what I see
is 25 to 45 % pure.

467
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:44,507
There are no adulterants, no alkaloids,
no dilutents.

468
00:37:45,623 --> 00:37:47,134
It's a hundred percent.

469
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:54,308
- May I?
- Take it with you.

470
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:57,132
Thank you, Frank.

471
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:54,953
I'll take it.

472
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,528
No contingencies, no loan,
no nothing.

473
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:00,038
Cash.

474
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,353
Fabulous.

475
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,589
Im not talking
about your proclivities.

476
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:12,954
Those I only know too well.
Im talking about being a cop.

477
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:15,830
You talking about taking money?

478
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:17,867
I don't do that.
Not my thing.

479
00:40:18,118 --> 00:40:20,537
And your friends from the hood,
still hang out with them?

480
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,863
Yeah. Play baseball on the weekends.

481
00:40:23,265 --> 00:40:25,316
Wise guys?
It's gonna look good.

482
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:28,252
Guys I went to school with, so what?

483
00:40:28,548 --> 00:40:30,175
What about Joseph Sadano?

484
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:32,981
What about him?

485
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,757
Im just trying to understand
things your wife has said.

486
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:38,655
- If they're not true, tell me.
- Yeah, hes one of them.

487
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:41,125
Is he also your sons godfather?

488
00:40:41,748 --> 00:40:43,292
He's definitely fucking her.

489
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:45,255
Do you really care about this?

490
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:48,213
Or do you just not want her
to win ever?

491
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:55,219
You know there's an interview room?
On the second floor.

492
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,663
- That's what I thought.
- Door locks from the inside.

493
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,062
All rise!

494
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,094
Fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer.

495
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,161
Don't answer!

496
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:43,573
- Richie Roberts.
- Hey, Norm!

497
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,649
- Richie Roberts.
- Hi, Det. Norman Riley.

498
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:50,476
- Hi, Norman. How are you?
- Good.

499
00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:53,147
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

500
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:04,484
Nice night to come out, huh?
It's like Grand Central around here.

501
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:06,626
It's been like this.

502
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:08,810
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight.

503
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,022
It's like nothing we've seen before.

504
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:17,770
Something I gotta sign?

505
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:19,612
Yeah, this way.

506
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:22,921
I'm taking this with me.
I'll register it, all right?

507
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:29,095
<i>America's public enemy number one</i>

508
00:42:29,324 --> 00:42:32,042
<i>in the United States
is drug abuse.</i>

509
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,518
<i>In order
to fight and defeat this ennemy,</i>

510
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,424
<i>It is necessary to wage</i>

511
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:39,635
<i>a new all out offensive.</i>

512
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,595
<i>Federal authorities
have announced their intention</i>

513
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:47,045
<i>to establish special
narcotics bureaus in Washington</i>

514
00:42:47,204 --> 00:42:49,037
<i>New York, Los Angeles, Chicago...</i>

515
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:50,975
A detective without the support

516
00:42:51,198 --> 00:42:53,480
of his fellow detectives
really can't do much.

517
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:57,010
You know why I don't have it.

518
00:42:58,353 --> 00:43:00,509
Doesn't matter.
You do what you have to do.

519
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:04,455
The greatest city in the world
is turning into an open sewer.

520
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,018
Everybody's stealing.

521
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,036
Dealing.

522
00:43:10,313 --> 00:43:12,362
You can't work
because you did your job!

523
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:16,624
Good news is you're not
the only honest cop in town.

524
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:19,183
This special narcotics bureau
in Washington

525
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:21,150
is not a dog and pony show.

526
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:23,200
They're sincere.

527
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,376
I know it because
they want us to orchestrate it

528
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:27,829
and I want you
to head up things here on our end.

529
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:29,667
If it's federal,
who do I answer to?

530
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,366
- Post office?
- You answer to me.

531
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:33,911
Me and the U.S. Attorney,
nobody else.

532
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:38,162
You never step foot
in a police station again,

533
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:39,927
work out at your own place.

534
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:41,384
You pick your own guys,

535
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:44,870
Guys that you know wouldnt
take a nickel off the sidewalk.

536
00:44:07,308 --> 00:44:08,762
<i>- Huey.
- Huey!</i>

537
00:44:09,227 --> 00:44:10,713
<i>- What of what?
- Who's this?</i>

538
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:12,054
Who you think, boy?

539
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,360
<i>- Frank!
- Frank who?</i>

540
00:44:14,813 --> 00:44:16,234
<i>Your brother, negro.</i>

541
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:22,079
- That's right.
- Marvin!

542
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:23,759
- Where's Ma?
- What?

543
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:25,931
Where's...
Frank's on the phone!

544
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:27,626
How you doin, Frankie?

545
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:29,223
Frank, on the phone!

546
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,465
- Say what?
- Ma, Frank on the phone!

547
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:33,929
Oh, my Lord!

548
00:44:34,156 --> 00:44:36,267
Yo, when?
You just say it, man.

549
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:37,627
<i>I'll call you back</i>

550
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:40,196
at 6 o'clock.
Get everybody together, all right?

551
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:41,386
Mama, everybody.

552
00:45:02,888 --> 00:45:04,347
How you doin, Uncle Frank?

553
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:06,949
Get out of the car!
It's here.

554
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:09,586
Look at this!

555
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:11,737
My Lord!

556
00:45:12,102 --> 00:45:14,008
So glad to see you, boy.

557
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:18,913
I'm telling you,
some piece of land you got here.

558
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:22,855
- I wonder what the Boro people'd say.
- And whose house is that?

559
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,891
That is your house, Mama.

560
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:27,302
- Mine?
- That's yours.

561
00:45:28,914 --> 00:45:30,093
And who else?

562
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:46,164
Listen!

563
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:48,334
I wanna tell you how happy I am.

564
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:50,660
Seeing all my children at the table,

565
00:45:50,843 --> 00:45:52,992
and the grand children
at the same time.

566
00:45:53,424 --> 00:45:54,621
I'm so happy!

567
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,997
- Right on, Grandma!
- Enjoy yourselves.

568
00:45:57,393 --> 00:45:59,395
I hope you got a job,
the way you eatin all this.

569
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:01,884
That boy, he got an arm on him.

570
00:46:02,657 --> 00:46:03,738
A Major League arm.

571
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,270
- Oh yeah?
- Right?

572
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:07,341
Right on, Pop.

573
00:46:07,624 --> 00:46:10,261
After dinner,
let's see him throw around a bit.

574
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,991
You can't catch him, man.

575
00:46:12,162 --> 00:46:14,875
I'm telling you,
he throws harder than Gibson.

576
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:17,580
We're talking 95 miles an hour.

577
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:18,903
Can you catch him?

578
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:21,625
He'd go catch the grass.

579
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,479
He might have catched that thing
when I was about 5 years old.

580
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:26,266
Since then, he can't keep up.

581
00:46:30,044 --> 00:46:31,633
This is your room.

582
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:32,824
Perfect.

583
00:46:35,812 --> 00:46:37,083
Look at this.

584
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:41,351
It's beautiful.

585
00:46:41,597 --> 00:46:43,216
Real beautiful, this.

586
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,681
How did you...

587
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,263
I had it made.

588
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,367
From memory.

589
00:46:57,622 --> 00:46:59,235
You were 5 when they took it away.

590
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,760
- Right.
- How could you...

591
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,527
How could I forget, Mamma?

592
00:47:07,388 --> 00:47:08,954
I thought you did.

593
00:47:09,776 --> 00:47:11,295
It, it... is perfect.

594
00:47:11,755 --> 00:47:13,398
It's all perfect.

595
00:47:18,956 --> 00:47:21,380
I can't tell you
how much I love you.

596
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,174
I love you too, Mother.

597
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:25,548
It's okay.

598
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:37,606
Both these guys, good with wires.
They got solid informants.

599
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:39,293
They're honest.

600
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:40,682
And fearless.

601
00:47:41,023 --> 00:47:42,958
They're insane, Richie,
like you.

602
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:45,048
Where are they?

603
00:47:48,506 --> 00:47:50,653
That's Jones,
with the skinny white broad.

604
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:53,018
Best I've ever seen on the street.

605
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,739
He knows dope,
but he's together.

606
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,727
He's a stand up guy, all around.

607
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,677
That's Abruzzo

608
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:02,589
with the two black fat ones.

609
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,501
He loves a big ass, man.

610
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:08,686
He's a bulldog.

611
00:48:09,243 --> 00:48:11,889
He don't fuck around,
he got a bit of a temper yeah, but,

612
00:48:12,149 --> 00:48:14,403
you could trust this guy
with your grandma.

613
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:15,917
Listen.

614
00:48:16,246 --> 00:48:19,170
We work together. You want me,
you got to take them, too.

615
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:32,961
When do we start?

616
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:37,328
<i>The man I worked for</i>

617
00:48:37,486 --> 00:48:41,268
ran one of the biggest companies
in New York City for more than 50 years.

618
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:43,290
15 years,

619
00:48:43,595 --> 00:48:45,337
8 months and 9 days

620
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,153
I was with him every day,

621
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,029
protected him, looked after him.
I learned from him.

622
00:48:51,907 --> 00:48:54,169
Bumpy was rich,
but wasn't white man rich.

623
00:48:54,372 --> 00:48:55,648
He wasn't wealthy.

624
00:48:56,219 --> 00:48:58,298
He didnt own his own company.
He thought he did.

625
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,693
He just managed it.

626
00:49:00,174 --> 00:49:01,926
White men owned it,
so they owned him.

627
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:04,060
Nobody owns me though.

628
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,830
- How you doin, babe?
- Good.

629
00:49:06,272 --> 00:49:09,057
Cause I own my own company,
and my company sells a product

630
00:49:09,254 --> 00:49:11,203
thats better than the competitions.

631
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:14,714
At a price thats lower
than the competitions.

632
00:49:16,102 --> 00:49:17,442
What are we selling here?

633
00:49:33,383 --> 00:49:34,527
How you doin, Red?

634
00:49:35,423 --> 00:49:37,332
My brothers,
just got here from North Carolina,

635
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,753
Guys, this is Redtop.

636
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:41,174
- How you doin?
- And the ladies.

637
00:49:41,337 --> 00:49:42,487
Nice family.

638
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:44,949
What? Ya'll niggas
never seen hoochie before?

639
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:46,991
Why they all naked?

640
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:48,712
So they can steal nothin.

641
00:49:51,592 --> 00:49:54,106
Most important thing in business
is honesty.

642
00:49:54,582 --> 00:49:56,045
Integrity, hard work.

643
00:49:57,447 --> 00:49:58,454
Family.

644
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,377
Never forgetting
where we came from.

645
00:50:01,884 --> 00:50:03,092
Thank you, Charlene.

646
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:10,708
See, you are what you are
in this world.

647
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,591
That's either one of two things.

648
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:16,799
Either you're somebody.

649
00:50:18,206 --> 00:50:20,137
Or nobody.
I'll be right back.

650
00:50:36,497 --> 00:50:37,603
I need this fresh,

651
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,913
cause if I come back here,
you'll know what it is.

652
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:41,687
- You don't play that.
- I hear you,

653
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:44,459
you won't have to come back.
There will be no problem.

654
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:46,571
Where's my money?

655
00:50:46,774 --> 00:50:49,259
Redtop gave you the package,
you supposed to hand me my money.

656
00:50:49,462 --> 00:50:51,205
Here's a jar right here.
20 %.

657
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:53,126
- You got the jar?
- That's right.

658
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,960
Get the fuck outa here...

659
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,337
What you gonna do?
What the fuck you gonna do?

660
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:00,666
What you doin?

661
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:02,818
You wanna shoot me,
in front of everybody?

662
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,106
Huh? Come on!

663
00:51:06,886 --> 00:51:07,927
Shit.

664
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:21,176
Here you go.

665
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:22,843
20 %.

666
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:48,083
So, what was I sayin?

667
00:51:58,817 --> 00:52:02,083
This is the newly formed
Essex County narcotics squad.

668
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:07,337
Our mandate is to make major arrests.
No street guys.

669
00:52:08,276 --> 00:52:10,911
We're looking for the suppliers
and the distributors.

670
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:13,092
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.

671
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:15,997
No grass under 1,000 pounds.
No powder under 40 kilos.

672
00:52:16,373 --> 00:52:18,395
Less than that,
someone else can waste their time.

673
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:20,696
We'll be handling big shipments,
big money,

674
00:52:20,923 --> 00:52:22,140
and big temptation.

675
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:24,286
I heard a story about you.
That you found

676
00:52:24,565 --> 00:52:27,595
a million $ in unmarked cash.
And you gave that shit back.

677
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:29,119
Is that true?

678
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,792
Yeah, I did.
Anyone got a problem with that?

679
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:39,153
So do I.
I think about it everyday.

680
00:52:39,347 --> 00:52:42,362
I should be down in Florida with
a 68 full cruiser dual, fishing sharks.

681
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:44,096
- You and me both.
- But you know...

682
00:52:44,279 --> 00:52:46,266
I didn't, so here I am, and...

683
00:52:47,782 --> 00:52:49,636
We'll try to land
some other kinda sharks.

684
00:53:16,952 --> 00:53:18,368
- All right?
- Bingo.

685
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:43,233
See that?

686
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:46,486
And this stuff is everyday's stuff.

687
00:53:47,353 --> 00:53:48,748
But this Blue Magic,

688
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,291
twice the potency.

689
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:52,853
The purest thing
I've ever seen in the street.

690
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:54,789
Strong enough to smoke.

691
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:58,013
That's for those suburban
white kids scared of needles.

692
00:53:58,426 --> 00:54:00,009
You paid 10 bucks for that?

693
00:54:00,277 --> 00:54:02,708
And it's everywhere,
on every corner.

694
00:54:02,926 --> 00:54:04,495
So how's that possible?

695
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:08,163
Who can afford to sell shit
twice as good for half as much?

696
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:19,084
Hey man, good to see you!

697
00:54:19,421 --> 00:54:21,127
- Doin good?
- Yeah, just got back

698
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:22,933
from a trip to the south of France.

699
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,458
Know what I'm sayin?

700
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:42,166
Here you go!

701
00:54:46,974 --> 00:54:48,193
Who is that?

702
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:01,139
Ladies and gentlemen.

703
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,765
The Proud Bomber, the champ.

704
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,947
Mr. Joe Louis!

705
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:16,448
Who's that with Joe?

706
00:55:16,908 --> 00:55:18,177
Miss Puerto Rico.

707
00:55:19,006 --> 00:55:20,064
Puerto Rico?

708
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:23,519
- She a beauty queen.
- Real. The beauty queen.

709
00:55:49,969 --> 00:55:51,350
My main man.

710
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,283
Excuse us for a minute, please.

711
00:55:58,439 --> 00:55:59,616
Sure, Frank.

712
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,109
Thank you.

713
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:08,526
What's goin on?

714
00:56:08,737 --> 00:56:09,970
What you smiling about?

715
00:56:10,136 --> 00:56:11,517
- I dunno.
- What is this?

716
00:56:11,886 --> 00:56:12,982
What's what?

717
00:56:13,366 --> 00:56:14,684
- What?
- Come here.

718
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:18,215
What's that you wearin?

719
00:56:18,457 --> 00:56:19,613
What's what?

720
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:21,951
That, what you got on?

721
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,805
A very, very, very nice suit.

722
00:56:23,986 --> 00:56:25,376
Very, very nice suit, huh?

723
00:56:25,557 --> 00:56:27,259
That's a clown suit,
a costume, man,

724
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,608
with a big sign that says:
"Arrest me".

725
00:56:29,882 --> 00:56:32,357
Understand? You too loud,
you're making too much noise.

726
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:34,638
Look at me.
The loudest one in the room

727
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:37,763
is the weakest one in the room,
I tell you that.

728
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:41,448
- You tryin to be like Nicky Barnes?
- What's the problem with him?

729
00:56:41,655 --> 00:56:43,799
- I like him.
- I got no problem. You like him?

730
00:56:44,153 --> 00:56:46,081
You wanna be like him?
You wanna be Superfly?

731
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:47,795
You wanna work for him?

732
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:49,709
Share a jail cell with him?
Cook for him?

733
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:52,985
- He wants to talk to you.
- So, you talkin to him about me now?

734
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,513
What about?

735
00:56:54,649 --> 00:56:56,326
- It ain't like that.
- Then what is it?

736
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:58,381
- Your name came up.
- About what?

737
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,280
I don't know, I told him I'd tell you.

738
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:04,978
You know, boy...

739
00:57:07,183 --> 00:57:09,562
If you wasn't my bro', I'd kill you.
You know that?

740
00:57:09,714 --> 00:57:11,727
I'd blow your fuckin brains out.

741
00:57:11,893 --> 00:57:14,208
- Don't be like that.
- I'm taking you shoppin this week.

742
00:57:14,353 --> 00:57:15,897
- I can do it alone.
- I can tell.

743
00:57:49,984 --> 00:57:51,368
You still owe me that dance.

744
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:52,667
Doc, come on.

745
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,149
Frank.

746
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:55,733
Check this.

747
00:58:06,263 --> 00:58:07,705
- How you doing?
- Hi.

748
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:09,979
- Frank Lucas.
- Eva Jendo.

749
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,978
Nice to meet you, Eva.

750
00:58:12,262 --> 00:58:13,805
Nice to meet you, Frank.

751
00:58:15,055 --> 00:58:16,872
You're Frank,
and this is your place.

752
00:58:17,206 --> 00:58:19,613
That's right, I'm Frank
and this is my place.

753
00:58:25,817 --> 00:58:27,462
Why is it called Small's?

754
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:29,235
Why not Frank's?

755
00:58:31,025 --> 00:58:33,211
When you own something,
you call it what you want.

756
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,682
Small's.

757
00:58:36,203 --> 00:58:37,360
Or Frank's.

758
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:39,007
Frankie Small's.

759
00:58:39,344 --> 00:58:40,380
Small's Frankie.

760
00:58:42,325 --> 00:58:43,363
That's right.

761
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:45,816
You want to let my hand go?

762
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,010
Okay.

763
00:58:50,404 --> 00:58:51,509
You're leaving?

764
00:58:51,793 --> 00:58:53,296
No, I was going to my table.

765
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,306
You need someone to go with you?

766
00:58:57,939 --> 00:58:58,995
Yes?

767
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:07,225
Wash your hand?
I got one print of that.

768
00:59:07,398 --> 00:59:08,576
You'll smudge it.

769
00:59:10,543 --> 00:59:12,573
- Here you go.
- What about him?

770
00:59:12,754 --> 00:59:14,231
- Who's that?
- Joey Sadano.

771
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:15,729
Don Cattano's nephew.

772
00:59:16,193 --> 00:59:18,813
- Put him up there by the big man
- He looks like you, Abruzzo.

773
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:20,010
- Not as handsome.

774
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,468
- Looks more like your sister.
- Where's Ice Pick Paul?

775
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,762
Funny. You guys should
take that show on the road.

776
00:59:25,097 --> 00:59:26,769
So we need...
Ice Pick Paul.

777
00:59:28,771 --> 00:59:29,831
There you go.

778
00:59:31,278 --> 00:59:32,696
He goes near the top.

779
00:59:33,258 --> 00:59:36,246
No, Ice Pick Paul is a soldier,
this guy is a lieutenant.

780
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,597
"...you have passed the
New Jersey Bar Examination."

781
00:59:40,584 --> 00:59:42,056
That guy is a soldier.

782
00:59:42,218 --> 00:59:44,170
This guy's a lieutenant.
No way he's on top.

783
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:46,647
You're thinking Benny the Bishop.
Benny Two Socks,

784
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:49,785
- Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.
- Jonesy's right.

785
00:59:50,098 --> 00:59:53,152
Which one of you has actually seen
Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

786
00:59:53,796 --> 00:59:54,813
Actually,

787
00:59:55,057 --> 00:59:56,950
- seen it go down?
- Yeah, seen it go down,

788
00:59:57,098 --> 00:59:59,202
been in his place,
seen him handle drugs?

789
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,924
That rat Rickie has told us.

790
01:00:01,387 --> 01:00:02,630
He's fuckin dead!

791
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,397
About 4 weeks ago.

792
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,019
He's dead.

793
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:09,197
Well, we can take him
off the fuckin board.

794
01:00:09,516 --> 01:00:11,995
I don't think
we got any solid evidence

795
01:00:12,534 --> 01:00:14,127
on anybody on that board.

796
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:17,137
What you saying?
This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

797
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:20,389
I say take it down.
We start again from the street.

798
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:26,007
That's considerably more
than one year's salary.

799
01:00:27,787 --> 01:00:29,098
If it disappears...

800
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:31,602
we'll not be able
to get it for you again.

801
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:34,467
That's yours.

802
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:36,429
Sign on my life for you again?

803
01:00:37,053 --> 01:00:38,653
For a lousy twenty grand?

804
01:00:42,034 --> 01:00:43,516
It has to be Blue Magic, OK?

805
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:45,198
It's gonna be Blue.

806
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,024
- Pick it up here tomorrow.
- $ 20,000.

807
01:00:48,301 --> 01:00:49,708
Just leave it there.

808
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,663
- How did it go?
- Good.

809
01:01:08,045 --> 01:01:09,203
Here he comes.

810
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:10,883
- That's him?
- Yeah.

811
01:01:12,207 --> 01:01:13,242
He's quick.

812
01:01:25,259 --> 01:01:28,082
- He goes into the City. What do we do?
- Stay with the fuckin money.

813
01:01:28,307 --> 01:01:29,931
We stay with the money, all right?

814
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:31,777
- We can't go there!
- Yes, we can.

815
01:01:32,058 --> 01:01:34,128
That's 20 grand in there
that I'm responsible for.

816
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:37,239
- I ain't losin it, follow the money!
- It's out of our jurisdiction!

817
01:01:37,503 --> 01:01:39,350
- Follow the money!
- All right!

818
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,710
He's pulling over.

819
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:57,466
All right, here we go.

820
01:01:58,092 --> 01:01:59,209
Let me out here.

821
01:02:01,779 --> 01:02:04,512
- Don't disappear, all right?
- I'll circle the block.

822
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:44,133
Sit down!

823
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:48,074
Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doin?

824
01:02:49,034 --> 01:02:51,585
<i>You're up to something, huh?
He's going bowling.</i>

825
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:55,117
Look at that.
Right between the legs.

826
01:02:55,299 --> 01:02:56,834
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

827
01:02:56,996 --> 01:02:58,042
Get the fuck up!

828
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:00,769
<i>- It's my bag.
- Shut the fuck up! What did I tell you?</i>

829
01:03:01,013 --> 01:03:02,921
<i>- Keep your your head down!
- What you doin?</i>

830
01:03:03,104 --> 01:03:05,236
<i>- Sit down and shut up!
- Don't you move!</i>

831
01:03:18,122 --> 01:03:19,129
Hey guys!

832
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:20,662
Guys! Officers!

833
01:03:22,001 --> 01:03:23,808
I'm Richie Roberts.
Newark.

834
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:27,206
That's... my money.

835
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:30,337
What the fuck?
What money?

836
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:35,086
The bills are sequenced,
they're registered with the Essex

837
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:36,741
County Prosecutors Office.

838
01:03:36,944 --> 01:03:39,655
Check them up.
They all start with CF3500.

839
01:03:39,922 --> 01:03:40,937
Have a look.

840
01:03:45,997 --> 01:03:47,162
Fucking registers.

841
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:50,139
I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft
sitting in my driveway.

842
01:03:50,545 --> 01:03:51,738
Honest mistake.

843
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,444
I'll just get the money.

844
01:03:55,205 --> 01:03:56,206
This time.

845
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:02,873
When's the last time I was in Jersey?
Let me think.

846
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:06,276
Never.

847
01:04:08,356 --> 01:04:10,448
Whatre you doing coming over here
unannounced?

848
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:12,706
You know you can get hurt
doing that?

849
01:04:14,663 --> 01:04:16,403
You got your fucking money.

850
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,628
Richie.

851
01:04:18,516 --> 01:04:19,809
And never ever

852
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,199
come into this city again unannounced.

853
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,672
You come in to see
a fuckin Broadway show?

854
01:04:24,964 --> 01:04:27,244
You call ahead first to see
if its okay with me.

855
01:04:29,338 --> 01:04:30,475
No problem.

856
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:37,247
- Go hit some ball.
- Great suits.

857
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,458
Is that your car?

858
01:04:42,456 --> 01:04:43,662
Fucking great car.

859
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:46,570
Have a nice fuckin trip
back to Jersey.

860
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:48,154
All right.

861
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,660
Come on, I got a tea time.
Let's go.

862
01:05:03,544 --> 01:05:04,945
This is your father?

863
01:05:06,225 --> 01:05:07,943
That's Martin Luther King.

864
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:10,798
- It is not.
- Yes, it is Martin Luther King.

865
01:05:10,971 --> 01:05:13,438
- You know, "I have a dream".
- Of course.

866
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:15,046
No, that's...

867
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:18,123
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King.

868
01:05:18,538 --> 01:05:20,440
- To me.
- What did he do?

869
01:05:21,523 --> 01:05:24,037
A lot of things, he was a...
friend.

870
01:05:25,152 --> 01:05:27,284
Served New York,
New York served him.

871
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,834
He was my boss.

872
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:31,544
My teacher.

873
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:33,402
What did he teach you?

874
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:35,732
He taught me a lot of things. He...

875
01:05:37,963 --> 01:05:39,871
Taught me how to take my time.

876
01:05:41,497 --> 01:05:45,114
That if I was going to do something,
to do it with care, love.

877
01:05:46,335 --> 01:05:47,339
Anything else?

878
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,890
Taught me to be a gentleman.

879
01:05:54,603 --> 01:05:55,712
That's what you are?

880
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:58,100
That's what I try to be.
Come here.

881
01:05:59,524 --> 01:06:00,803
Come sit here.

882
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:04,798
Look at me.

883
01:06:05,986 --> 01:06:08,743
I own about five apartments
in Manhattan.

884
01:06:10,373 --> 01:06:12,955
Homes all over the East Coast.
Could've taken you to anyone of'em,

885
01:06:13,146 --> 01:06:15,272
but I didn't.
I brought you here.

886
01:06:15,929 --> 01:06:19,039
- I was looking for you, boy.
- Cause I want you to meet my mother.

887
01:06:19,479 --> 01:06:20,779
How you doin, Ma?

888
01:06:21,181 --> 01:06:22,829
- Is this her?
- Eva,

889
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,524
- this is my mother.
- Hi, Eva.

890
01:06:25,168 --> 01:06:26,433
Nice to meet you.

891
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:27,939
She's beautiful.

892
01:06:28,606 --> 01:06:29,690
Look at her.

893
01:06:29,985 --> 01:06:31,274
She's an angel

894
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,175
come down from Heaven.

895
01:06:33,636 --> 01:06:34,655
Thank you.

896
01:06:42,817 --> 01:06:43,826
Mr. Roberts.

897
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:46,108
I'm here for our appointment.

898
01:06:50,578 --> 01:06:51,974
- Morning.
- Morning.

899
01:06:54,337 --> 01:06:56,043
Sorry, our appointment?

900
01:06:56,654 --> 01:06:58,130
Child Social Services.

901
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:14,821
She did mention your name though.

902
01:07:15,913 --> 01:07:18,532
- The stewardess?
- No, not her.

903
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:22,451
The lady from Social Services,
she mentioned your name.

904
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:25,091
Right after she asked me

905
01:07:25,283 --> 01:07:27,415
if I associated with any criminals.

906
01:07:27,591 --> 01:07:29,406
- All right, go!
- You want to see this?

907
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:30,890
Hey, boys!

908
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:32,690
Joey!

909
01:07:33,535 --> 01:07:34,794
Get in the pool.

910
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,388
Come on!

911
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,202
How'd she get my name?

912
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,550
Laurie.

913
01:07:47,005 --> 01:07:48,887
She's been saying a lot lately.

914
01:07:50,194 --> 01:07:51,229
A lot.

915
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:57,645
When you asked me to be
your son's godfather,

916
01:07:57,799 --> 01:07:59,464
- I took it very seriously.
- I know.

917
01:07:59,761 --> 01:08:01,082
And I appreciate that.

918
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:03,974
And I said yes, I would take on
that responsability

919
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:06,849
to take care of your son, if God forbid,
something happened to you.

920
01:08:07,026 --> 01:08:09,601
Jo, the things she said
to Child Social Services

921
01:08:09,762 --> 01:08:11,280
make me look really bad.

922
01:08:11,527 --> 01:08:12,397
You know.

923
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,628
All kinds at the house at night time,

924
01:08:14,851 --> 01:08:17,166
low life informants around.
Women...

925
01:08:17,491 --> 01:08:18,831
Old friends like me.

926
01:08:19,947 --> 01:08:21,486
Old friends like you, yeah.

927
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:25,694
Uncle Joey!
Watch me!

928
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:30,834
I understand.

929
01:08:31,101 --> 01:08:33,618
They ask me, I'll tell them
what you want me to tell.

930
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,830
- I'll lie for you.
- Don't lie.

931
01:08:36,123 --> 01:08:37,321
You don't have to lie.

932
01:08:37,554 --> 01:08:40,356
Just... omit certain details.

933
01:08:41,243 --> 01:08:42,441
Sure, all right.

934
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:47,423
I have something else to ask you.

935
01:08:47,685 --> 01:08:50,041
You don't have to answer
if you don't want.

936
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:54,031
Blue Magic.

937
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,375
Anything?

938
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:00,706
A lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work. That's all.

939
01:09:02,883 --> 01:09:04,172
What, your guys?

940
01:09:04,744 --> 01:09:05,723
His guys.

941
01:09:07,129 --> 01:09:09,024
You know where it's comin from?

942
01:09:10,088 --> 01:09:12,333
Guys down south,
that's all I heard.

943
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:14,786
- Cubans?
- I dunno.

944
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,256
Or Mexico?

945
01:09:18,004 --> 01:09:19,060
Don't know.

946
01:09:19,676 --> 01:09:21,849
You're telling me
it's from South America?

947
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:23,066
I don't know!

948
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:28,211
Whoever it is, they're upsetting
the natural order of things.

949
01:09:29,388 --> 01:09:30,525
That's all there is.

950
01:09:46,712 --> 01:09:48,205
<i>- What's up?
- My man.</i>

951
01:09:48,497 --> 01:09:49,507
<i>How's it lookin?</i>

952
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,614
I want you to meet Mike Sobota.

953
01:11:20,966 --> 01:11:22,448
- How're you doing?
- How're you?

954
01:11:22,631 --> 01:11:24,806
- What can I get you?
- A left hander, Charlie told me

955
01:11:24,965 --> 01:11:26,427
- about your nephew.
- Oh, Mr...

956
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:28,864
- Yankees.
- Yeah, yeah! Hey, Steve!

957
01:11:29,181 --> 01:11:30,476
- Come here.
- Excuse me.

958
01:11:30,638 --> 01:11:33,247
He's good. Put him in the team.
You're good enough, right?

959
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,943
I'm a Lucas.
Good enough on a bad day.

960
01:11:36,144 --> 01:11:38,964
So don't make it a bad day,
make it a good day, you understand?

961
01:11:40,498 --> 01:11:43,320
Excuse me. Police department.
Now back out, baby.

962
01:11:46,838 --> 01:11:48,219
I'll take your ass in, Jimmy.

963
01:11:48,635 --> 01:11:50,381
You can't take me in for that.

964
01:11:50,943 --> 01:11:52,839
I got a licence for that, motherfucker.

965
01:11:53,504 --> 01:11:55,681
You got a licence for this?
Excuse me, all right?

966
01:11:58,571 --> 01:11:59,801
Shit, all right!

967
01:12:01,361 --> 01:12:03,788
I got to arrest you.
Shit's too good to be on the street.

968
01:12:04,963 --> 01:12:07,300
- What you doin, man?
- You ain't arresting nobody.

969
01:12:07,778 --> 01:12:09,316
You bribing me now?

970
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:13,215
I tell you what,
I'm arresting everybody. All of you.

971
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:14,663
You first!

972
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:21,849
- How can that be?
- What was that?

973
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,091
Get this fuckin...
what's the matter with you?

974
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:25,639
- What was that?
- What?

975
01:12:25,935 --> 01:12:28,824
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- What's your fuckin problem?

976
01:12:33,967 --> 01:12:35,366
I just shot him in the leg.

977
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:36,869
Damn, Jimmy!

978
01:12:38,499 --> 01:12:39,535
Get up!

979
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:54,693
Everybody, get out!

980
01:12:55,021 --> 01:12:56,091
Get out!

981
01:12:57,436 --> 01:13:00,062
- Frank, it was an accident.
- Wasn't no goddamn accident.

982
01:13:00,488 --> 01:13:03,360
He don't feel shit cause he's coked up
all the motherfuckin time!

983
01:13:04,253 --> 01:13:06,165
He's your driver,
get rid of him.

984
01:13:06,455 --> 01:13:07,655
He's your cousin!

985
01:13:07,837 --> 01:13:09,568
He ain't shit to me,
he means nothin.

986
01:13:09,741 --> 01:13:12,116
- What'll he do, go back home?
- I don't give a damn!

987
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:13,424
Send his ass home!

988
01:13:14,446 --> 01:13:16,415
Don't rub on that.
You'd block that.

989
01:13:16,697 --> 01:13:20,394
You understand?
That's alpaga, $25,000 alpaga.

990
01:13:20,586 --> 01:13:23,668
You'd block that shit.
Don't rub, put club soda on it.

991
01:13:25,773 --> 01:13:27,016
Listen, from now on,

992
01:13:27,231 --> 01:13:29,220
don't nobody talk to me directly,
understand?

993
01:13:29,403 --> 01:13:30,711
You got business with me,

994
01:13:30,934 --> 01:13:33,095
you talk to Huey,
Huey talks to me, got it?

995
01:13:33,307 --> 01:13:35,715
- All right.
- Never on the phone, got it?

996
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:39,245
And take them
goddamn sunglasses off!

997
01:13:39,566 --> 01:13:42,247
- Take the goddamn sunglasses off!
- Damn it, man!

998
01:13:45,385 --> 01:13:47,402
Simple-minded ass motherfuckers.

999
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:04,777
The whole place was imported

1000
01:14:05,929 --> 01:14:07,147
brick by brick.

1001
01:14:08,536 --> 01:14:09,612
Gloucestershire.

1002
01:14:10,849 --> 01:14:12,649
- Who?
- Quite famous.

1003
01:14:13,633 --> 01:14:14,648
Yours.

1004
01:14:19,809 --> 01:14:20,819
Here you go.

1005
01:14:25,937 --> 01:14:26,992
Pull!

1006
01:14:32,559 --> 01:14:33,630
Come, Eva.

1007
01:14:35,206 --> 01:14:37,947
I'm sure you're dying to see
the rest of the house.

1008
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:43,816
Of course. Excuse me.

1009
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,327
Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

1010
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:54,178
What do you think of monopolies?

1011
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,266
- You mean, like the game?
- No, I just think

1012
01:14:58,608 --> 01:15:00,798
monopolies are made illegal
in the country, Frank,

1013
01:15:00,986 --> 01:15:02,901
cause no one wants to compete.

1014
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:05,974
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1015
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:07,932
Let the dairy farmers do that,

1016
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:11,213
half of them'd
go out of business tomorrow.

1017
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:14,142
- Im just trying to make a living.
- It's your right.

1018
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:16,887
Everybody's right. It's America.

1019
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:21,201
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable expense of others.

1020
01:15:22,353 --> 01:15:24,221
Cause it becomes un-American.

1021
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,613
That's why the price we pay
for that gallon of milk

1022
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,687
never represents the true cost
of production

1023
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:31,287
cause it's gotta be controlled.
It's gotta be set.

1024
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:32,885
It's gotta be fair.

1025
01:15:33,078 --> 01:15:35,464
Controlled by who?
I set a price I think is fair.

1026
01:15:35,627 --> 01:15:37,175
- I don't think it is.
- You don't?

1027
01:15:37,338 --> 01:15:38,333
I don't.

1028
01:15:38,515 --> 01:15:40,613
I know your customers
are happy, Frank.

1029
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:43,104
Bunch of fuckin junkies
that they are.

1030
01:15:43,591 --> 01:15:45,765
What about your fellow dairy farmers?

1031
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:48,148
Are you thinking of us?

1032
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:50,254
You thinking of them?

1033
01:15:50,807 --> 01:15:52,127
The dairy farmers?

1034
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:56,692
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about
as much as they've thought about me.

1035
01:15:57,646 --> 01:15:59,256
I'm just thinking out loud.

1036
01:16:00,626 --> 01:16:02,762
If you took some of your inventory,

1037
01:16:03,342 --> 01:16:05,027
and you sold it wholesale.

1038
01:16:06,867 --> 01:16:09,642
Sit.
We could work.

1039
01:16:10,535 --> 01:16:12,342
You could use some distribution.

1040
01:16:13,604 --> 01:16:16,780
I dunno, I'm pretty good.
I got 110th to 155th,

1041
01:16:17,045 --> 01:16:18,568
river to river, I'm all right.

1042
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:21,991
It's kind of a mom and pop store
next to what Im talking about,

1043
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:23,859
and that's bigger than K-Mart.

1044
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:26,889
I'm talking about L.A.,
Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas.

1045
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:28,620
Let's go nationwide.

1046
01:16:29,272 --> 01:16:31,729
I'm gonna guarantee you
peace of mind here.

1047
01:16:32,303 --> 01:16:33,620
You don't want that?

1048
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:36,252
You gonna need it.

1049
01:16:37,056 --> 01:16:38,687
I don't know how you feel me.

1050
01:16:38,918 --> 01:16:40,705
I'm kind of a Renaissance man.

1051
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:42,729
The people I deal with on a daily basis,

1052
01:16:42,962 --> 01:16:44,751
they're not enlightened.

1053
01:16:45,012 --> 01:16:47,428
You talk to them about civil rights,
they don't know.

1054
01:16:47,654 --> 01:16:48,994
They're not open to change.

1055
01:16:49,452 --> 01:16:52,132
Not from the way things are done,
and who's doing it.

1056
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,994
I can talk to them,
so there's no misunderstanding.

1057
01:16:57,964 --> 01:17:00,746
That's what I mean
by peace of mind.

1058
01:17:03,423 --> 01:17:04,432
Here

1059
01:17:05,523 --> 01:17:08,069
You're paying what,
75, 80 thousand a kilo?

1060
01:17:10,912 --> 01:17:12,639
I'm a Renaissance man too.

1061
01:17:14,141 --> 01:17:15,704
I'd consider 50,000.

1062
01:17:24,726 --> 01:17:28,007
Why would you trust these people?
And the way they look at you.

1063
01:17:28,168 --> 01:17:30,537
They look at me like it's Xmas
and I'm Santa Claus.

1064
01:17:30,674 --> 01:17:32,585
They look at us like we're the help.

1065
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:35,481
They work for me, now.

1066
01:17:40,854 --> 01:17:42,986
<i>I predict it when I meet Joe Frazier,</i>

1067
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:45,358
<i>this will be like a good amateur</i>

1068
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:47,436
<i>fighting a real professional.</i>

1069
01:17:47,613 --> 01:17:50,065
<i>This will be like a kid
out of the Olympics...</i>

1070
01:17:50,389 --> 01:17:52,194
That's gonna be Ali in three.

1071
01:17:53,308 --> 01:17:54,882
C'mon, cat, you dig it?

1072
01:17:56,245 --> 01:17:58,868
<i>- You're fightin Joe Frazier.
- It's no depth, and besides the point.</i>

1073
01:17:59,023 --> 01:18:00,197
He's on pot, man.

1074
01:18:00,346 --> 01:18:02,784
- Look at Frazier.
- Ali's craftsman, baby.

1075
01:18:03,068 --> 01:18:04,883
<i>- I'll stop you.
- Stop me? You?</i>

1076
01:18:05,008 --> 01:18:06,114
<i>How soon? What round?</i>

1077
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:08,331
<i>- No, don't let him obligate you.
- 1 to 10.</i>

1078
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,170
<i>You'll be out. I'll win.</i>

1079
01:18:10,471 --> 01:18:13,068
<i>Time out.
March 8, 1971.</i>

1080
01:18:13,465 --> 01:18:16,773
<i>Here we are at Madison Square Garden
for the fight of the century. </i>

1081
01:18:16,952 --> 01:18:20,222
<i>And by anybody's definition,
this is a happening.</i>

1082
01:18:20,443 --> 01:18:22,483
<i>There are handshakes, and of course,</i>

1083
01:18:22,627 --> 01:18:24,657
<i>there are utterly beautiful women.</i>

1084
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:26,957
<i>But behind the smiles
and the handshakes,</i>

1085
01:18:27,128 --> 01:18:29,775
<i>you can feel the atmosphere
so heavy with tension</i>

1086
01:18:29,944 --> 01:18:31,586
<i>it's almost unbearable.</i>

1087
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,397
<i>Everybody's who's anybody is here.</i>

1088
01:18:34,683 --> 01:18:36,713
<i>Like Sinatra, like Graziano.</i>

1089
01:18:36,853 --> 01:18:40,273
<i>David Roth and Diahann Carroll.
Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.</i>

1090
01:18:40,404 --> 01:18:42,274
<i>The celebrities are pouring in.</i>

1091
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,299
<i>The way you all build it up,
Life Magazine cover,</i>

1092
01:18:45,464 --> 01:18:48,125
<i>Time Magazine,
everybody gives their opinion.</i>

1093
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:50,738
<i>Joe Louis here says I'll lose.</i>

1094
01:18:51,036 --> 01:18:54,317
<i>When Joe Louis says I'm gonna lose,
I know I feel wonderful.</i>

1095
01:18:55,149 --> 01:18:57,601
<i>Joe Louis always picks the wrong man.</i>

1096
01:19:09,798 --> 01:19:12,600
<i>Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee!</i>

1097
01:19:13,126 --> 01:19:14,916
Not watching the fight, Bob?

1098
01:19:15,227 --> 01:19:16,545
I'm not into boxing.

1099
01:19:18,076 --> 01:19:19,588
It ain't boxing, kid.

1100
01:19:20,617 --> 01:19:21,746
It's politics.

1101
01:19:25,403 --> 01:19:27,180
I got something for you too.

1102
01:19:31,186 --> 01:19:32,598
A coat? For me?

1103
01:19:34,766 --> 01:19:36,016
Do you like it?

1104
01:19:36,517 --> 01:19:38,479
The coat? Yeah, it's nice.

1105
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,028
What do you think?

1106
01:19:43,164 --> 01:19:44,538
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1107
01:19:53,032 --> 01:19:54,325
Over here, Sammy!

1108
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,039
Hey, Sammy, get'em up!

1109
01:19:59,181 --> 01:20:00,528
Joe Louis, over here!

1110
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,174
How's it goin, Frank?

1111
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,625
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1112
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:17,303

<i>because everyone's in here tonight.</i>

1117

Let's go, take your seats now.
C'mon!

1118
01:20:41,114 --> 01:20:42,252
<i>Main event.</i>

1119
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:44,806

<i>From Louisville, Kentucky,</i>

<i>- This is Frank Lucas.

1127
01:21:01,507 --> 01:21:03,278
<i>Here is Muhammad</i>

1128

<i>he's wearing green trunks.</i>

1132

Who's that laughing with Cattano?

1133
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,949
How'd he get
so fuckin close to the ring?

1134
01:21:18,145 --> 01:21:19,324
<i>The heavyweight</i>

1135

<i>Joe Frazier!</i>

You gonna keep that hat on all night?
I'll miss the fight.

1138
01:21:31,559 --> 01:21:32,614
You paid for it.

1139
01:21:37,052 --> 01:21:38,240
Joe, over here!

1140
01:22:18,676 --> 01:22:20,612
<i>This guy's a supplier at most,
or just a pimp.</i>

1141
01:22:20,771 --> 01:22:23,569
<i>- Otherwise we'd know about him.
- His tickets were phenomenal.</i>

1142
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:25,624
Better seats than Dominic Cattano.

1143
01:22:26,246 --> 01:22:27,858
Joe Louis shook his hand.

1144
01:22:29,354 --> 01:22:31,056
Who the fuck is this guy?

1145
01:22:35,088 --> 01:22:36,237
What's this?

1146
01:22:36,592 --> 01:22:38,713
That's the plate of the limo.

1147
01:22:38,969 --> 01:22:41,138
Check with the company
who rented it.

1148
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:46,579
Right there, Mr. Lucas!
Right there.

1149

Picture here!

01:22:51,548 --> 01:22:53,035
Looking good, Frank!

1151
01:22:58,561 --> 01:23:00,106
Congratulations!

1152
01:23:05,818 --> 01:23:07,872
She's the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

1153
01:23:07,992 --> 01:23:09,977
That's my sunshine right there,
Mr. Williams.

1154
01:23:10,281 --> 01:23:11,926
I wish Bumpy couldve met her.

1155
01:23:17,933 --> 01:23:19,199
Get a picture.

1156
01:23:28,771 --> 01:23:30,580
Now come here, baby.

1157
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,662
- What's happening?
- Sit tight.

1158
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:00,659
Congratulations, Frank.

1159
01:24:01,808 --> 01:24:02,945
Detective.

1160
01:24:03,311 --> 01:24:05,890
You're sure you did the right thing?
I mean, she's a beautiful

1161
01:24:06,148 --> 01:24:08,576
- girl and all. Don't get me wrong.
- Hey, listen.

1162
01:24:09,735 --> 01:24:11,625
Before you say anything
about me or my wife,

1163
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:13,866
understand this is
the most important day of my life.

1164
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:15,912
I understand,

1165
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:18,727
a man walks around in a $50,000
chinchilla coat

1166
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:20,858
and never even bought me
a cup of coffee...

1167
01:24:21,154 --> 01:24:22,886
there's something wrong there.

1168
01:24:23,322 --> 01:24:24,865
You pay your bills, Frank?

1169
01:24:25,714 --> 01:24:27,684
- Don't know what you're sayin.
- Pay your bills?

1170
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:30,610
If you're not getting your share,
you should go talk to your chief.

1171
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:33,886
What's my share?
Cause you don't fuckin know me.

1172
01:24:34,881 --> 01:24:37,576
- Maybe I am special.
- You are special.

1173
01:24:38,188 --> 01:24:39,860
Do you see that right there?

1174
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:42,603
Special Investigations Unit.

1175
01:24:43,464 --> 01:24:44,579
Special.

1176
01:24:45,582 --> 01:24:46,624
Get it?

1177
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,174
Ten grand, first of each month,

1179
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:54,820
- Are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

1180
01:24:58,337 --> 01:25:01,033
Don't forget your card.
Have a fuckin nice honeymoon.

1181
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:02,392
Let's go.

<i>His name is Frank Lucas,</i>

1183

originally from Greensboro,
North Carolina.

1184

Couple of arrests years ago,
gambling and unlicensed firearm.

1185
01:26:12,507 --> 01:26:14,932
For fifteen years,
he was Bumpy Johnson's driver.

1186
01:26:15,238 --> 01:26:17,009
Bodyguard and collector.

1187
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,294
He was with him when he died.

1188
01:26:20,503 --> 01:26:22,051
He's got five brothers.

1189
01:26:22,405 --> 01:26:23,635
He's the oldest.

1190
01:26:24,005 --> 01:26:25,798
And a lot of cousins.

1191
01:26:26,463 --> 01:26:27,737
They all live up here now,

1192
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:29,767
spread throughout
the five boroughs in Jersey.

1193
01:26:30,757 --> 01:26:32,267
The brothers are Dexter,

1194
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:35,101
<i>- What can I do for you?
- In Brooklyn, a dry cleaner.</i>

1195
01:26:35,226 --> 01:26:36,245
Picking up.

1196
01:26:38,118 --> 01:26:41,302
<i>Melvin in Queens has a custom
furniture and fire door business.</i>

1197

01:26:52,987 --> 01:26:55,584
<i>And Huey Lucas in Bergen County

1201
01:26:55,857 --> 01:26:57,051
Is there a manager here?

1202
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:59,254
- That's my price.
- I'll take it somewhere else.

1203
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:02,774
<i>These businesses are the distribution
and collection points</i>

1204
01:27:02,938 --> 01:27:05,346
<i>for Frank's dope,
and Frank's money.</i>

1205
01:27:05,964 --> 01:27:09,083
Everything about Frank's life
seems unpretentious,

1206
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:11,306
<i>orderly and legitimate.</i>

1207

<i>Takes a meeting with the accountant,
or his lawyer.</i>

1211
01:27:23,288 --> 01:27:25,256
<i>At night, he usually stays at home,</i>

1212
01:27:25,392 --> 01:27:26,612
<i>and if he does go out,</i>

1213
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,786
<i>it's to one of two clubs, or a handful
of restaurants with his new wife.</i>

1214
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:33,184
<i>Ball players, friends</i>

1215

01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:39,457
<i>Sundays,
he takes his mother to church.</i>

1217
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:42,453
<i>Then he drives out
and he changes the flowers</i>

1218
01:27:42,642 --> 01:27:45,805
on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday no matter what.

1219
01:27:46,837 --> 01:27:48,288
<i>Not your typical day in the life</i>

1220
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:49,794
<i>of a dope man, Richie.</i>

1221
01:27:51,086 --> 01:27:53,934
<i>Bumpy's life wasn't typical either,
and he ran Harlem for years.</i>

1222
01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:58,117
<i>You're saying that Frank Lucas
replaced Bumpy Johnson?</i>

1223
01:27:58,658 --> 01:28:00,120
<i>- Yeah.
- His driver?</i>

1224
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,644
Sounds a little far-fetched.

1225
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:05,579
<i>But is it?
Because everything he does...</i>

1226
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,865
<i>Handing out turkeys.</i>

1227
01:28:07,024 --> 01:28:09,223
<i>He does the same
as Bumpy would've done.</i>

1228
01:28:09,407 --> 01:28:11,158
<i>Who was Bumpy most likely to teach?</i>

1229
01:28:12,462 --> 01:28:13,954
The guy he sees every day.

1230
01:28:14,813 --> 01:28:16,613
<i>It's like a Sicilian family.</i>

1231
01:28:17,274 --> 01:28:19,209
He structured his organization

1232
01:28:19,353 --> 01:28:21,060
to protect him in the same way.

1233
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:22,778
And if he was with Bumpy for so long,

1234
01:28:22,935 --> 01:28:25,368
that means he would've spent
a lot of time with Italians,

1235
01:28:25,527 --> 01:28:27,776
definitively long enough
to learn that much.

1236
01:28:28,344 --> 01:28:29,809
But here's the thing.

1237
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,548
I don't think it's Frank Lucas
we're after.

1238
01:28:32,773 --> 01:28:35,551
Who we want
is whoever Lucas is working for.

1239
01:28:35,837 --> 01:28:37,761
Whoever is bringing the heroin in.

1240
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:38,926
Okay.

1241
01:28:39,961 --> 01:28:43,358
So, what do you have on him
that'll stick in court?

1242
01:28:43,557 --> 01:28:45,029
Because this isn't it.

1243
01:28:46,044 --> 01:28:48,155
Without powder,
without informants,

1244
01:28:48,668 --> 01:28:50,122
no one's going to jail.

1245
01:28:50,364 --> 01:28:52,675
That's understood, Sir,
I don't think we'll get

1246
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:54,936
informants,
not from inside the family.

1247
01:28:55,194 --> 01:28:57,837
Unless we get very, very lucky.

1248
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:07,755
That's it down there.

1249
01:29:54,016 --> 01:29:55,463
Let's all join hands.

1250
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:01,301
Lord, we thank you for this food

1251
01:30:01,483 --> 01:30:04,116
we're about to receive
the nourishment of our bodies.

1252
01:30:04,343 --> 01:30:06,305
Fill our souls with heavenly grace,

1253
01:30:06,504 --> 01:30:08,855
in Jesus' name, and for his sake.

1254
01:30:09,216 --> 01:30:11,089
- Amen.
- Amen!

1255
01:30:32,133 --> 01:30:33,241
It's OK.

1256
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:35,006
Come on.

1257
01:30:36,176 --> 01:30:37,308
It's OK.

1258
01:30:38,363 --> 01:30:41,487
- Better ready yourself.
- C'mon, big man, throw the ball.

1259
01:30:41,998 --> 01:30:43,687
- C'mon.
- Get yourself ready, ol' man.

1260
01:30:44,732 --> 01:30:46,170
C'mon, now.

1261
01:30:46,967 --> 01:30:47,982
C'mon, now.

1262
01:30:48,201 --> 01:30:50,410
I'm going to set your ass
in the grass, Uncle Melvin.

1263
01:30:50,739 --> 01:30:53,088
Watch your mouth, boy,
and throw the ball.

1264
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:55,860
Damn, Uncle Melvin,
I gonna pitch that out field.

1265
01:30:57,129 --> 01:30:58,177
Come here.

1266
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:00,708
Sit down.

1267
01:31:00,871 --> 01:31:01,901
Uncle Frank.

1268
01:31:02,447 --> 01:31:03,534
What's happenin?

1269
01:31:03,857 --> 01:31:04,897
How you doin?

1270
01:31:05,284 --> 01:31:06,287
Cool.

1271
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:07,545
Want a drink?

1272
01:31:07,858 --> 01:31:09,814
- You know better than that.
- Just checking.

1273
01:31:13,308 --> 01:31:15,428
Why didn't you show up
for that meeting?

1274
01:31:17,317 --> 01:31:19,665
I set it up with the Yankees
and Billy Martin.

1275
01:31:22,358 --> 01:31:23,809
Why didn't you show up?

1276
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:27,835
Don't lie to me.

1277
01:31:28,888 --> 01:31:30,875
I don't want to play ball no more.

1278
01:31:31,854 --> 01:31:34,758
- I decided.
- What you mean, decided what?

1279
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,161
- I don't want it.
- What you talkin about?

1280
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,713
You play since you was little,

1281
01:31:38,892 --> 01:31:40,683
you're ready for the pros,
what do you...

1282
01:31:41,884 --> 01:31:43,071
We got a problem.

1283
01:31:46,324 --> 01:31:47,436
What do you want?

1284
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:51,286
I want what you got, Uncle Frank.

1285
01:31:52,034 --> 01:31:53,059
I want to be you.

1286
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:38,244
My man!

1287
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:42,257
- Welcome, Frank.
- How you doin, Nick?

1288
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:44,293
It's all great, welcome.

1289
01:32:45,234 --> 01:32:47,327
- I need to talk to you.
- Right, c'mon.

1290
01:32:50,088 --> 01:32:52,440
Yeah, everybody's good,
everybody's happy,

1291
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:55,168
Charlie, Baz, the Italians,
johnny law,

1292
01:32:55,345 --> 01:32:56,997
everybody's happy except you.

1293
01:32:57,556 --> 01:32:59,797
I don't get why you have
to take something that's

1294
01:33:00,016 --> 01:33:01,271
perfectly good,

1295
01:33:02,014 --> 01:33:03,123
and mess it up.

1296
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:05,052
See, brand name,

1297
01:33:05,251 --> 01:33:07,381
brand name means something,
you understand?

1298
01:33:07,528 --> 01:33:08,802
Shut the fuck up!

1299
01:33:10,116 --> 01:33:12,250
Go ahead.
Sorry about that bullshit.

1300
01:33:13,462 --> 01:33:14,597
Blue Magic.

1301
01:33:15,488 --> 01:33:16,640
That's a brand name.

1302
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:18,831
Like Pepsi, that's a brand name.

1303
01:33:19,096 --> 01:33:21,461
I stand behind it, I guarantee it.

1304
01:33:21,761 --> 01:33:23,488
They know that even if
they don't know me

1305
01:33:23,747 --> 01:33:26,535
any more than
the chairman of General Mills.

1306
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:29,831
- What the fuck you talkin about?
- What I'm talking about is when you

1307
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:32,737
chop my dope down
to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 %,

1308
01:33:32,904 --> 01:33:35,272
and then call it
Blue Magic,

1309
01:33:35,932 --> 01:33:38,422
that's trademark infringement,
understand?

1310
01:33:39,379 --> 01:33:41,797
With all due respect,
if I buy something I own it.

1311
01:33:41,971 --> 01:33:43,006
That ain't true.

1312
01:33:43,143 --> 01:33:45,512
I buy a car,
I can paint the motherfucker.

1313
01:33:45,685 --> 01:33:47,933
But you don't have to,
that's what I'm saying to you,

1314
01:33:48,067 --> 01:33:50,670
it's good enough the way it is.
You can make enough money of it

1315
01:33:50,829 --> 01:33:52,763
the way it is
just by calling it Blue Magic.

1316
01:33:52,898 --> 01:33:54,485
More than that is greed, son!

1317
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,591
What you want?
That I change the name?

1318
01:33:56,752 --> 01:33:58,782
I'd have to insist
that you change the name.

1319
01:33:59,006 --> 01:34:00,053
Fine by me,

1320
01:34:00,292 --> 01:34:01,478
I'll call it Red Magic.

1321
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:03,897
- Even if it don't sound as good.
- Name it what you want.

1322
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,687
Put a choker on it, motherfucker,

1323
01:34:05,839 --> 01:34:08,368
and call it Blue Dogshit,
know what I mean?

1324
01:34:08,531 --> 01:34:10,618
Just don't let me
catch you doing this again.

1325
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:15,278
"Catch me",
"infringement", "insist" ?

1326
01:34:15,772 --> 01:34:18,223
I don't like these words
as much as "please",

1327
01:34:18,572 --> 01:34:20,396
"thank you, sorry to bother you Nicky,"

1328
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:23,572
these are better words to use
when you come to my club uninvited.

1329
01:34:23,707 --> 01:34:24,747
Hear me?

1330
01:34:26,282 --> 01:34:27,312
My man.

1331
01:34:36,008 --> 01:34:37,090
Shit.

1332
01:34:37,835 --> 01:34:39,275
Fuck, is that cops there?

1333
01:34:48,278 --> 01:34:49,316
It's all right.

1334
01:34:50,884 --> 01:34:52,935
What the hell they gonna do,
give us a ticket?

1335
01:34:53,896 --> 01:34:55,546
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1336
01:34:58,196 --> 01:35:00,320
- What?
- Some of it is in the trunk.

1337
01:35:03,102 --> 01:35:05,859
- How you doin, Frank?
- Good, how was your Thanksgiving?

1338
01:35:06,511 --> 01:35:08,870
Not so good as a matter of fact.
Get out of the car.

1339
01:35:14,624 --> 01:35:16,674
- Give me the keys.
- Where's the Shelby at?

1340
01:35:16,871 --> 01:35:19,199
It's gone. Stay right there.

1341
01:35:19,417 --> 01:35:20,745
Yes, sir, right here.

1342
01:35:22,337 --> 01:35:23,968
Got anything worth lookin at?

1343
01:35:24,425 --> 01:35:25,756
That's the Trupo guy.

1344
01:35:26,008 --> 01:35:27,420
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

1345
01:35:27,885 --> 01:35:29,069
Fuckin prick.

1346
01:35:32,315 --> 01:35:33,820
Come here a minute, Frank.

1347
01:35:36,589 --> 01:35:37,922
What we gonna do about this?

1348
01:35:38,462 --> 01:35:41,407
Nothing, close it up, throw it back in,
everybody go home.

1349
01:35:41,695 --> 01:35:43,427
Have some pumpkin pie,
warm apple cider.

1350
01:35:43,715 --> 01:35:45,327
I got a better idea.

1351
01:35:46,294 --> 01:35:48,881
Or would you rather me
throw you and your bro in the river?

1352
01:35:49,789 --> 01:35:51,911
Or would you rather
your house blows up next time?

1353
01:35:57,417 --> 01:35:59,307
- I loved that car.
- I know.

1354
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:04,085
What's he doin?

1355
01:36:04,433 --> 01:36:05,618
Shakedown.

1356
01:36:06,332 --> 01:36:08,873
Somebody's getting some money
for the benevolent funk.

1357
01:36:10,388 --> 01:36:11,548
Sorry, Frank.

1358
01:36:11,762 --> 01:36:13,146
Go on, get in the car.

1359
01:36:37,516 --> 01:36:39,108
All right, you call me back.

1360
01:36:41,294 --> 01:36:42,937
INS, IRS, FBI,

1361
01:36:43,168 --> 01:36:45,098
can't get a damn thing out of them.

1362
01:36:45,281 --> 01:36:47,462
Cause they all think
you're on the take.

1363
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:49,971
And you think they are.

1364
01:36:50,884 --> 01:36:52,894
I don't think they want this to stop.

1365
01:36:53,819 --> 01:36:55,565
He employs too many people.

1366
01:36:56,315 --> 01:37:00,006
Judges, lawyers, cops,
politicians, prison guards,

1367
01:37:00,539 --> 01:37:02,002
probation officers.

1368
01:37:03,307 --> 01:37:06,611
His dope stops flowing in, a hundred
thousand people lose their job.

1369
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:20,593
What the fuck is a microwave?

1370
01:37:20,812 --> 01:37:24,076
It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1371
01:37:26,143 --> 01:37:28,143
It rearranges the molecules.

1372
01:37:28,449 --> 01:37:30,024
- Of what?
- Of what...

1373
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:31,304
Of popcorn.

1374
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:36,517
Of your head.
Stick it in, go on.

1375
01:37:39,815 --> 01:37:41,520
I can get you one of those.

1376
01:37:41,976 --> 01:37:43,493
Brand new, just like this.

1377
01:37:43,847 --> 01:37:45,283
I'll have it delivered.

1378
01:37:45,613 --> 01:37:46,898
No, thank you.

1379
01:37:58,265 --> 01:38:01,230
- Where is that?
- Aspen, we just got back.

1380
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:03,836
- Great time. You know who we met?
- Who?

1381
01:38:05,276 --> 01:38:06,515
Burt Reynolds.

1382
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,514
I'm not kidding.

1383
01:38:11,107 --> 01:38:14,312
Hollywood people go up there,
they're buying up everything.

1384
01:38:15,152 --> 01:38:16,410
This is your place?

1385
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:17,912
You know what its worth?

1386
01:38:18,108 --> 01:38:20,576
Ski in, ski out,
five bedrooms,

1387
01:38:20,795 --> 01:38:22,161
sauna, everything.

1388
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:23,960
We were guests.

1389
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:29,993
It's your place.

1390
01:38:45,421 --> 01:38:47,411
Isnt there something we can do

1391
01:38:49,751 --> 01:38:51,231
about leaving the big guy alone?

1392
01:38:52,779 --> 01:38:54,128
You know what I mean.

1393
01:38:54,767 --> 01:38:58,105
I dont report what you just said,
then I can get in a lot of trouble.

1394
01:38:58,419 --> 01:39:00,432
I do report it,
and the trouble is yours.

1395
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:04,999
Hoping you won't do that.

1396
01:39:06,598 --> 01:39:08,450
C'mon, I am not taping it.

1397
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:11,424
How do you know?
Because we're friends.

1398
01:39:12,351 --> 01:39:15,463
- I'm telling you, this is a real offer.
- From who?

1399
01:39:16,014 --> 01:39:17,128
Your uncle?

1400
01:39:20,545 --> 01:39:22,951
Why would you do this?
Why risk our friendship?

1401
01:39:23,229 --> 01:39:24,413
Because...

1402
01:39:26,775 --> 01:39:28,505
I care what happens to you.

1403
01:39:31,016 --> 01:39:32,680
You shouldnt have done it.

1404
01:39:33,418 --> 01:39:36,304
I had too, I had no choice,
neither do you, Richie!

1405
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:39,098
You don't have a choice!
Just leave

1406
01:39:39,536 --> 01:39:41,068
Frank Lucas alone!

1407
01:39:42,507 --> 01:39:43,654
Frank Lucas?

1408
01:39:49,038 --> 01:39:51,251
Tell Maria I had to leave,
I'm sorry.

1409
01:39:52,644 --> 01:39:53,770
Tell her why.

1410
01:40:36,972 --> 01:40:38,382
- Talk!
- Don't shoot!

1411
01:40:38,581 --> 01:40:40,408
- Are you Richie Roberts?
- Yes, so what?

1412
01:40:41,766 --> 01:40:43,540
It's been served.
Sorry.

1413
01:41:03,442 --> 01:41:04,477
Laurie.

1414
01:41:06,653 --> 01:41:09,451
I'm sorry I never gave you
the kind of life you wanted.

1415
01:41:10,486 --> 01:41:12,329
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1416
01:41:15,898 --> 01:41:17,913
Don't punish me for being honest.

1417
01:41:18,771 --> 01:41:20,302
Don't take my boy away.

1418
01:41:22,955 --> 01:41:24,437
What? Are you saying...

1419
01:41:24,893 --> 01:41:26,324
that because you were honest

1420
01:41:26,503 --> 01:41:28,929
and didn't take money
like every other cop, I left you?

1421
01:41:29,696 --> 01:41:30,954
No, you don't take money

1422
01:41:31,193 --> 01:41:32,306
for one reason.

1423
01:41:32,497 --> 01:41:35,186
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1424
01:41:35,605 --> 01:41:37,924
It's worse than taking money
nobody gives a shit about!

1425
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:40,847
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1426
01:41:41,127 --> 01:41:44,398
I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me!

1427
01:41:44,703 --> 01:41:47,452
Or don't take it, I don't care,
but don't go cheating on me!

1428
01:41:47,597 --> 01:41:49,671
Or on your kid
by never being around.

1429
01:41:49,806 --> 01:41:51,628
Don't go out and get laid
by your snitches,

1430
01:41:51,846 --> 01:41:53,666
and your secretaries and strippers!

1431
01:41:53,861 --> 01:41:56,114
I can tell by just looking
she's one of'em.

1432
01:41:57,953 --> 01:42:00,526
You think you're going to Heaven
cause you're honest.

1433
01:42:00,785 --> 01:42:01,899
But you're not!

1434
01:42:02,654 --> 01:42:05,853
You're going to the same hell
as the crooked cops you can't stand!

1435
01:42:06,573 --> 01:42:07,737
All rise!

1436
01:42:12,551 --> 01:42:14,043
Please, be seated.

1437
01:42:15,657 --> 01:42:16,834
Ms. Dickerson.

1438
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:19,738
Before the court renders its opinion,

1439
01:42:20,156 --> 01:42:22,683
is there anything else
you'll like to be heard on?

1440
01:42:22,959 --> 01:42:24,232
Yes, your honor.

1441
01:42:24,807 --> 01:42:27,036
Your Honor, a lot has been said here
today about

1442
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:30,003
how unsavory Mr. Roberts
environment is for a child.

1443
01:42:30,459 --> 01:42:31,912
How dangerous it is.

1444
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,884
We tell him to protects us.

1445
01:42:34,206 --> 01:42:36,026
We give him that responsability
but then

1446
01:42:36,245 --> 01:42:38,529
say "Oh, we dont trust you
to raise a child."

1447
01:42:38,690 --> 01:42:41,319
- "We don't think you're fit for that."
- I'm not.

1448
01:42:42,681 --> 01:42:43,749
You're right.

1449
01:42:45,363 --> 01:42:47,492
Being around me
is no place for a kid.

1450
01:42:47,855 --> 01:42:50,925
You take him to Vegas.
I'll come see him when I can.

1451
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:57,098
Your Honor, I want to apologize
for wasting the court's time.

1452
01:43:09,594 --> 01:43:10,604
Doc.

1453
01:43:11,488 --> 01:43:12,518
I see him.

1454
01:43:13,017 --> 01:43:14,130
Here he is.

1455
01:43:33,028 --> 01:43:34,293
What's going on?

1456
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:37,256
Champagne?

1457
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:39,122
- Merry Xmas, detectives!
- For us?

1458
01:43:39,274 --> 01:43:40,448
Yeah, enjoy that.

1459
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:42,813
Fellas, have a good time.

1460
01:43:45,026 --> 01:43:46,112
Good stuff.

1461
01:43:50,247 --> 01:43:52,517
<i>The South Vietnamese troops
conducted airstrikes</i>

1462
01:43:52,705 --> 01:43:55,074
<i>on communist positions inside the city.</i>

1463
01:43:57,195 --> 01:43:59,660
Paying all of johnny law,
that's one thing.

1464
01:44:00,043 --> 01:44:01,992
I got no problem with that,
I've been...

1465
01:44:02,253 --> 01:44:04,400
paying off the police since I was ten,

1466
01:44:04,599 --> 01:44:07,224
putting more of their kids to college
than the National Merit Award.

1467
01:44:07,385 --> 01:44:08,719
Give me one of them rounded.

1468
01:44:09,019 --> 01:44:10,693
This is different though.

1469
01:44:11,341 --> 01:44:13,645
This Special Investigative Unit,
that's their problem,

1470
01:44:13,844 --> 01:44:16,436
- they think they're special.
- Fucking crooks.

1471
01:44:16,731 --> 01:44:18,801
- No code of ethics.
- What do you think?

1472
01:44:19,059 --> 01:44:20,790
Looks great. It's beautiful.

1473
01:44:21,628 --> 01:44:22,668
Good.

1474
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:25,394
The police, that's not what
I'm worrying about.

1475
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:27,695
I'm seeing cars
where I never seen 'em before.

1476
01:44:27,868 --> 01:44:30,057
- People I don't know.
- Yeah, me too.

1477
01:44:34,301 --> 01:44:36,052
- Merry Xmas, Charlie.
- Thank you.

1478
01:44:36,408 --> 01:44:38,278
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1479
01:44:40,344 --> 01:44:41,408
Take this.

1480
01:44:42,469 --> 01:44:43,980
A quick toast and I'll be off.

1481
01:44:51,659 --> 01:44:54,359
- We're gonna have a great time.
- That's right, chica.

1482
01:44:54,492 --> 01:44:56,605
Mr. Lucas.
Enjoy your evening.

1483
01:44:58,047 --> 01:44:59,147
It's all clear.

1484
01:45:04,772 --> 01:45:07,004
<i>- Who is that?
-  It's Nicky. You see him?</i>

1485
01:45:07,302 --> 01:45:08,577
Yeah, I see him.

1486
01:45:09,146 --> 01:45:10,346
Just keep going.

1487
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:12,558
- Around back?
- Hell, no,

1488
01:45:12,775 --> 01:45:14,606
I ain't sneaking in my own club.

1489
01:45:15,656 --> 01:45:16,937
Incredible.

1490
01:45:17,767 --> 01:45:19,014
<i>Increhible.</i>

1491
01:45:39,715 --> 01:45:40,770
Come on.

1492
01:45:44,288 --> 01:45:45,333
Hold on.

1493
01:45:53,648 --> 01:45:54,688
What?

1494
01:45:54,888 --> 01:45:56,401
I want to wait in the car.

1495
01:45:56,664 --> 01:45:58,445
I got it, I'll wait for this.

1496
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:02,252
- Get that yellow sauce.
- Yellow sauce.

1497
01:46:02,568 --> 01:46:04,499
And the chicken,
the Kung Pao chicken.

1498
01:46:10,569 --> 01:46:11,922
Can you turn the heater on?

1499
01:46:18,683 --> 01:46:20,709
Shit.
I'm gonna go get the keys.

1500
01:46:34,888 --> 01:46:36,893
- Doc, give me the key.
- Here you go.

1501
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:44,225
Doc!

1502
01:46:48,584 --> 01:46:49,592
Get out!

1503
01:46:56,717 --> 01:46:57,765
You're okay?

1504
01:46:58,833 --> 01:46:59,876
Shit!

1505
01:47:00,332 --> 01:47:02,282
- Come on.
- Are you all right?

1506
01:47:04,219 --> 01:47:05,269
Let's go.

1507
01:47:26,218 --> 01:47:27,442
Was it Nicky?

1508
01:47:29,308 --> 01:47:31,697
We'll go right now fuckin kill him
whether it was or not,

1509
01:47:31,874 --> 01:47:33,466
you say the word, Frankie.

1510
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:36,810
We got to do something.

1511
01:47:37,943 --> 01:47:40,105
- We can't just sit here.
- We're leaving.

1512
01:47:43,665 --> 01:47:45,275
- Everybody, get out.
- You all right?

1513
01:47:45,498 --> 01:47:48,371
Go on home. It's Xmas time,
you gotta be with your family.

1514
01:47:49,195 --> 01:47:50,942
Go on, be with your kids.

1515
01:48:05,738 --> 01:48:08,402
Where we gonna go?
Spain? Somewhere in China?

1516
01:48:09,228 --> 01:48:11,317
Sit down,
tell me where you want to go.

1517
01:48:14,062 --> 01:48:16,132
We can go anywhere we want.

1518
01:48:16,331 --> 01:48:17,803
- We can live anywhere.
- Where?

1519
01:48:18,008 --> 01:48:19,401
And do what? Run? Hide?

1520
01:48:19,647 --> 01:48:21,925
Frank Lucas don't run
from nobody, baby.

1521
01:48:22,686 --> 01:48:26,213
We ain't going nowhere,
we stay here, this is my home.

1522
01:48:26,954 --> 01:48:29,311
This is where my business is,
my wife, my mother,

1523
01:48:29,721 --> 01:48:32,607
my family, my country.
I ain't going nowhere.

1524
01:48:33,677 --> 01:48:35,322
I am running from nobody.

1525
01:48:37,154 --> 01:48:38,455
This is America.

1526
01:48:45,669 --> 01:48:47,609
And you ain't going away either.

1527
01:48:53,717 --> 01:48:55,895
<i>A ceasefire,
internationally supervised,</i>

1528
01:48:56,174 --> 01:48:58,129
<i>will begin at 7 pm</i>

1529
01:48:58,333 --> 01:49:00,612
<i>this Saturday, January 27,
Washington time.</i>

1530
01:49:00,771 --> 01:49:01,710
Call you back.

1531
01:49:01,865 --> 01:49:03,713
<i>Within 60 days from this saturday...</i>

1532
01:49:04,376 --> 01:49:05,769
What are you doing?

1533
01:49:16,009 --> 01:49:16,877
So...

1534
01:49:17,457 --> 01:49:20,402
From what I hear, a Corsican mob
took a shot at Frank.

1535
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:22,840
The French Connection, Fernando Rey,

1536
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:25,302
the exporters
that Frank has put out of business.

1537
01:49:26,596 --> 01:49:28,467
I can take care of him in New York.

1538
01:49:29,108 --> 01:49:32,028
I just dont want to worry every time
he drives across the bridge to Jersey

1539
01:49:32,168 --> 01:49:33,939
someones gonna take
another shot at him.

1540
01:49:36,322 --> 01:49:38,431
You and I gotta start
working together.

1541
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:40,691
We need to step up our efforts.

1542
01:49:41,529 --> 01:49:43,453
Next time, their aim could be better.

1543
01:49:44,705 --> 01:49:47,058
We need to keep this cash cow alive.

1544
01:49:53,110 --> 01:49:54,921
What the fuck you're doing here?

1545
01:50:00,456 --> 01:50:02,700
You actually gonna arrest Frank Lucas?

1546
01:50:03,225 --> 01:50:05,669
- What's the matter with you?
- What, you don't know?

1547
01:50:07,608 --> 01:50:09,615
Everybody in New Jersey is crazy.

1548
01:50:10,843 --> 01:50:12,210
You know what we do here?

1549
01:50:12,429 --> 01:50:14,542
Cops arrest bad guys.

1550
01:50:16,377 --> 01:50:18,250
Before you get on that bridge again,

1551
01:50:18,496 --> 01:50:19,980
you should call me first.

1552
01:50:21,095 --> 01:50:22,328
To make sure it's safe.

1553
01:50:25,146 --> 01:50:28,767
"I'm gonna enlighten some of my friends,
I can guarantee you peace of mind."

1554
01:50:28,975 --> 01:50:30,567
That's what you told me, Dominic.

1555
01:50:31,572 --> 01:50:34,367
"I can guarantee you peace of mind!"

1556
01:50:35,037 --> 01:50:36,696
I don't feel so peaceful!

1557
01:50:42,134 --> 01:50:44,335
They tried to kill my wife!

1558
01:50:48,761 --> 01:50:49,791
Who was that?

1559
01:50:52,552 --> 01:50:54,152
Maybe one of your people.

1560
01:50:54,989 --> 01:50:56,780
- I don't know yet.
- You don't?

1561
01:50:57,379 --> 01:50:58,541
You don't know.

1562
01:51:00,298 --> 01:51:02,268
I'll tell you what I know,
maybe I should just...

1563
01:51:02,674 --> 01:51:04,306
put 500 guns out there on the street,

1564
01:51:04,445 --> 01:51:06,355
start shooting up people
just to make a point.

1565
01:51:06,495 --> 01:51:08,742
It was a junkie,
or it was a rival.

1566
01:51:09,297 --> 01:51:11,586
Some dumb ass kid
trying to make a name for himself.

1567
01:51:11,818 --> 01:51:13,370
Someone you forgot to pay off.

1568
01:51:13,858 --> 01:51:15,957
Someone you slighted
without even realizing it.

1569
01:51:16,944 --> 01:51:18,754
Could be someone
you put out of business.

1570
01:51:19,067 --> 01:51:21,217
For being so successful.
Look at you!

1571
01:51:21,995 --> 01:51:23,038
Success,

1572
01:51:23,397 --> 01:51:26,247
it's got enemies.
Lots of enemies.

1573
01:51:27,308 --> 01:51:29,047
The success took a shot at you.

1574
01:51:29,316 --> 01:51:30,969
What you gonna do?
Kill it?

1575
01:51:31,159 --> 01:51:32,989
You gonna become unsuccessful?

1576
01:51:34,539 --> 01:51:37,148
We can be successful
and have enemies, right?

1577
01:51:37,799 --> 01:51:40,800
Or be unsuccessful too,
and have friends.

1578
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:43,545
That's the choice we make.

1579
01:51:45,524 --> 01:51:49,093
<i>The final evacuation of military
and diplomatic personnel</i>

1580
01:51:49,283 --> 01:51:52,189
<i>continued throughout the night
as North Vietnamese troops</i>

1581
01:51:52,491 --> 01:51:55,549
<i>marched on Saigon.
The imminent fall of the city</i>

1582
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:58,699
<i>has brought chaos
and a growing sense of desperation...</i>

1583
01:52:08,139 --> 01:52:11,084
<i>- Operator.
- Bangkok 367, international.</i>

1584
01:52:11,671 --> 01:52:13,004
One moment, please.

1585
01:52:20,267 --> 01:52:21,429
<i>Sawadeekap.</i>

1586
01:52:22,312 --> 01:52:24,650
<i>- Nate.
- Hey Frank, what's up?</i>

1587
01:52:24,967 --> 01:52:26,301
What's going on over there?

1588
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,458
<i>- It's all over.
- Yeah, I'm watchin the news.</i>

1589
01:52:28,634 --> 01:52:31,456
<i>- What the hell's going on?
- The game's over, Frank.</i>

1590
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:34,797
It's done. Everybody going home baby.
Give peace a chance.

1591
01:52:34,991 --> 01:52:37,976
Well now, I'm not... Listen to me.
I want two thou'.

1592
01:52:39,027 --> 01:52:41,698
I want 2,000 kis in the air.

1593
01:52:41,872 --> 01:52:43,424
<i>It's impossible, Frank.</i>

1594
01:52:43,792 --> 01:52:46,917
<i>- All our resources are going home.
- Tell you what. I'm on my way there.</i>

1595
01:52:47,167 --> 01:52:48,480
<i>- Right now?
- Yeah.</i>

1596
01:52:58,584 --> 01:53:00,015
Spear, wake the fuck up!

1597
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:01,397
What?

1598
01:53:03,025 --> 01:53:06,010
- Where do you think you're goin?
- Don't hurt me, Jimmy!

1599
01:53:08,135 --> 01:53:09,782
- Jesus, fuck!
- Police!

1600
01:53:10,142 --> 01:53:12,038
- Drop the gun, Jimmy!
- Drop it!

1601
01:53:12,449 --> 01:53:14,402
- Let me see your hands!
- Drop the fuckin gun!

1602
01:53:14,585 --> 01:53:17,216
I'm not playing,
I'll blast your fuckin head!

1603
01:53:17,443 --> 01:53:18,784
Don't shoot!

1604
01:53:20,628 --> 01:53:21,838
I got your gun,

1605
01:53:22,485 --> 01:53:23,916
and I got your prints.

1606
01:53:25,046 --> 01:53:26,469
You know what you got?

1607
01:53:27,155 --> 01:53:28,488
You got attempted murder.

1608
01:53:29,455 --> 01:53:31,138
Eighteen fucking years!

1609
01:53:31,705 --> 01:53:34,750
Attempted murder is the same as murder,
thats Grand Jury.

1610
01:53:35,175 --> 01:53:37,420
Now the Grand Jury
could come back favorably.

1611
01:53:37,642 --> 01:53:40,269
It could be reduced to manslaughter.

1612
01:53:41,455 --> 01:53:42,866
Maybe even self defense.

1613
01:53:43,164 --> 01:53:44,899
Depends on how we want
to deal with you.

1614
01:53:45,081 --> 01:53:46,793
You see where this is fucking going?

1615
01:53:47,071 --> 01:53:48,296
Lets say you beat it.

1616
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:50,691
What do you think
your cousin Frankll think?

1617
01:53:50,886 --> 01:53:53,019
He'll know that at some point in time,

1618
01:53:53,218 --> 01:53:55,407
we sat you down
and talked to you like this.

1619
01:53:55,744 --> 01:53:58,073
And then you go to court
and you beat attempted murder?

1620
01:53:58,476 --> 01:54:00,403
What he's gonna think?
Is he stupid?

1621
01:54:00,631 --> 01:54:03,297
- Is your cousin Frank stupid?
- Answer him!

1622
01:54:04,203 --> 01:54:06,663
No, he's gonna assume that you talked.

1623
01:54:09,923 --> 01:54:11,923
But right now, Frank doesn't know.

1624
01:54:12,625 --> 01:54:14,715
You want Frank
to read this in the papers?

1625
01:54:14,953 --> 01:54:16,755
Or you just wanna walk out of here?

1626
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:18,686
No bail, no trial,

1627
01:54:18,862 --> 01:54:20,896
no jail,
just walk out of here today.

1628
01:54:21,808 --> 01:54:23,017
Your choice.

1629
01:54:33,446 --> 01:54:35,957
Opium plants are hearty enough

1630
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:38,002
to outlive any war.

1631
01:54:38,915 --> 01:54:42,515
Theyll still be here
long after the troops are gone.

1632
01:54:44,385 --> 01:54:46,482
What are you going to do
for transportation

1633
01:54:46,773 --> 01:54:48,912
when the last US plane goes home?

1634
01:54:49,662 --> 01:54:51,152
I'll figure something out.

1635
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:55,435
Youll see me again,
that's for sure.

1636
01:54:57,221 --> 01:54:59,969
Its not in my best interest
to say this, Frank...

1637
01:55:00,752 --> 01:55:03,206
but quitting while youre ahead

1638
01:55:04,362 --> 01:55:06,055
is not the same as quitting.

1639
01:55:49,727 --> 01:55:50,663
Go get him.

1640
01:55:53,806 --> 01:55:55,817
- Whenever you want to, baby.
- A second.

1641
01:55:56,331 --> 01:55:57,386
It's Frank.

1642
01:56:01,581 --> 01:56:02,698
Newark.

1643
01:56:03,710 --> 01:56:04,940
short-term

1644
01:56:05,964 --> 01:56:07,453
parking lot 3.

1645
01:56:08,329 --> 01:56:09,584
Short-term lot 3.

1646
01:56:10,087 --> 01:56:11,679
It is the Mustang, right?

1647
01:56:11,951 --> 01:56:13,294
OK, what's the plate number?

1648
01:56:13,667 --> 01:56:14,642
K

1649
01:56:14,881 --> 01:56:15,916
- A.
- KA.

1650
01:56:16,195 --> 01:56:17,489
<i>76</i>

1651
01:56:17,649 --> 01:56:18,704
<i>0</i>

1652
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:20,087
<i>All right.</i>

1653
01:56:21,309 --> 01:56:23,208
There's no short-term lot 3 in Newark.

1654
01:56:23,499 --> 01:56:25,693
- They got letters, A, B,C, D.
- I know!

1655
01:56:25,992 --> 01:56:27,783
Maybe he means a time, 3 o'clock?

1656
01:56:28,172 --> 01:56:29,943
This is no Jersey plate.

1657
01:56:31,065 --> 01:56:32,531
Nor a New York one.

1658
01:56:33,036 --> 01:56:35,544
KA 760.

1659
01:56:37,072 --> 01:56:38,154
Kilo Alpha?

1660
01:56:39,229 --> 01:56:40,556
A plane tail number?

1661
01:56:41,252 --> 01:56:42,663
Kilo Alpha 760.

1662
01:56:44,246 --> 01:56:46,967
You check commercial planes,
you guys private planes.

1663
01:56:47,207 --> 01:56:48,660
Everything, from a little Cessna

1664
01:56:48,899 --> 01:56:50,769
to the biggest fuckin jet, alright?

1665
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,456
Check the miltary planes.
Where you going? Stay there.

1666
01:56:53,668 --> 01:56:54,856
Sit down!

1667
01:57:18,163 --> 01:57:19,231
Captain?

1668
01:57:19,965 --> 01:57:22,109
Richie Roberts, Essex County.

1669
01:57:22,533 --> 01:57:24,052
I know you're expecting us.

1670
01:57:24,327 --> 01:57:25,422
Here's our warrant.

1671
01:57:25,783 --> 01:57:27,189
We're looking on the plane.

1672
01:57:27,466 --> 01:57:29,340
- Wait.
- Scotty, stop all these soldiers,

1673
01:57:29,499 --> 01:57:31,290
check their bags, everyone of'em.

1674
01:57:41,867 --> 01:57:43,310
No knock, warrant.

1675
01:57:44,459 --> 01:57:45,941
Go ahead, start upstairs.

1676
01:57:46,225 --> 01:57:48,105
- Where are they going?
- Step this way.

1677
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:50,438
M'am, please sit down.

1678
01:57:50,736 --> 01:57:51,850
What is this?

1679
01:57:53,793 --> 01:57:54,958
Hold it! Stop!

1680
01:57:56,379 --> 01:57:59,150
Nothing leaves this area, all right?
Slow down with this.

1681
01:57:59,797 --> 01:58:01,714
- Stop these trucks.
- Hold on.

1682
01:58:01,941 --> 01:58:03,783
Everything off the walls,
pull it all down.

1683
01:58:03,922 --> 01:58:05,097
That thing's a monster.

1684
01:58:05,256 --> 01:58:07,433
- What is this?
- Nothing goes out til we've checked it.

1685
01:58:07,588 --> 01:58:08,956
All right, Captain? Nothing.

1686
01:58:09,142 --> 01:58:11,212
We're gonna take the plane down,
look at the trucks.

1687
01:58:11,362 --> 01:58:13,949
Every man here gets searched.
Read the warrant, Sir.

1688
01:58:15,079 --> 01:58:17,450
Your husbands
illustrious career is over.

1689
01:58:18,521 --> 01:58:21,506
The Feds are going to come in
and take everything.

1690
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,376
They gonna take it all.

1691
01:58:23,632 --> 01:58:25,572
But not before I get my gratuity.

1692
01:58:26,914 --> 01:58:28,108
So, wheres the money?

1693
01:58:28,383 --> 01:58:29,697
What money?

1694
01:58:30,017 --> 01:58:31,374
What money, you ask?

1695
01:58:31,823 --> 01:58:32,980
The getaway money

1696
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:35,825
that Frank and every other gangster
keeps in his house.

1697
01:58:36,077 --> 01:58:38,963
If you leave now, there's a chance
Frank might not kill you.

1698
01:58:41,127 --> 01:58:42,497
Shut up! Sit down!

1699
01:58:42,882 --> 01:58:43,957
Sit down!

1700
01:59:26,346 --> 01:59:30,459
<i>...plan the evacuation of all remaining
US combat forces from Vietnam.</i>

1701
01:59:30,839 --> 01:59:33,240
<i>News that come too late for some,</i>

1702
01:59:33,484 --> 01:59:36,504
<i>as here on the solemn tarmac
at Dover Air Force Base,</i>

1703
01:59:36,982 --> 01:59:40,385
<i>this C-130 loaded down
with its sorrowful cargo,</i>

1704
01:59:40,749 --> 01:59:42,824
<i>a cargo of America's bravest and best,</i>

1705
01:59:42,998 --> 01:59:44,868
<i>en route to their final resting places.</i>

1706
02:00:00,374 --> 02:00:01,818
You guys, take this coffin down.

1707
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:12,291
- Open it.
- I'm not doing that.

1708
02:00:18,844 --> 02:00:20,836
Great barking dog, huh?

1709
02:00:28,949 --> 02:00:30,474
You stop this. Right now!

1710
02:00:30,834 --> 02:00:33,521
My warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane.

1711
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:36,559
The plane and its cargo.

1712
02:00:37,009 --> 02:00:38,824
But you don't have my permission.

1713
02:00:40,164 --> 02:00:41,557
I don't need it, Captain.

1714
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:44,564
Easy! Easy!

1715
02:00:48,284 --> 02:00:49,578
Move out of the way.

1716
02:00:55,924 --> 02:00:56,964
Damn!

1717
02:01:02,075 --> 02:01:03,159
That's enough!

1718
02:01:10,904 --> 02:01:13,074
Stay with the coffins.
Don't let'em out of your sight.

1719
02:01:13,233 --> 02:01:14,327
Got it.

1720
02:01:16,486 --> 02:01:17,879
Help me out with this.

1721
02:01:42,722 --> 02:01:44,808
That was a military transport plane.

1722
02:01:45,212 --> 02:01:47,812
If there was heroin onboard,
someone in the military would have

1723
02:01:47,968 --> 02:01:50,462
to be involved, which means
that even as it fights a war

1724
02:01:50,789 --> 02:01:52,858
that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

1725
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:55,290
the military is smuggling narcotics.

1726
02:01:55,465 --> 02:01:57,984
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

1727
02:01:58,552 --> 02:02:01,395
That someone employed by this Office
believes that the US Army

1728
02:02:01,534 --> 02:02:03,066
is in the drug trafficking business,

1729
02:02:04,064 --> 02:02:06,187
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the remains

1730
02:02:06,386 --> 02:02:10,190
of young men who've given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

1731
02:02:10,429 --> 02:02:12,613
- There's dope on that plane.
- Shut the fuck up!

1732
02:02:14,064 --> 02:02:15,356
Is it any wonder then,

1733
02:02:15,613 --> 02:02:17,131
because of your actions,

1734
02:02:17,590 --> 02:02:20,506
the entire federal narcotics program
is now in jeopardy  of being dismantled

1735
02:02:20,745 --> 02:02:22,850
as completely and enthusiastically

1736
02:02:23,021 --> 02:02:24,868
as that fucking transport plane?

1737
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:27,330
Thats what youve accomplished
Mr. Roberts. Single-handedly.

1738
02:02:27,532 --> 02:02:29,005
I had good information

1739
02:02:29,607 --> 02:02:32,920
the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

1740
02:02:33,357 --> 02:02:35,109
- And that target is?
- Frank Lucas.

1741
02:02:35,248 --> 02:02:37,198
- Who?
- His name is Frank Lucas.

1742
02:02:37,527 --> 02:02:40,019
Who's Frank Lucas? Who's he work for?
Which family?

1743
02:02:40,190 --> 02:02:41,791
He's not Italian. He's black.

1744
02:02:45,514 --> 02:02:47,763
Is that supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

1745
02:02:48,444 --> 02:02:50,917
Youre this close to the end
of your career in law enforcement

1746
02:02:51,044 --> 02:02:52,318
and youre making jokes?

1747
02:02:53,541 --> 02:02:55,161
My investigation indicates

1748
02:02:55,932 --> 02:02:58,881
that Frank Lucas is above the mafia
in the dope business.

1749
02:02:59,442 --> 02:03:01,984
My investigation also
indicates that Frank Lucas

1750
02:03:02,287 --> 02:03:05,155
buys direct from a source
in Southeast Asia,

1751
02:03:05,454 --> 02:03:08,610
he cuts out the middlemen,
and uses US military planes

1752
02:03:08,868 --> 02:03:11,422
and personnel to transport pure No. 4

1753
02:03:11,701 --> 02:03:13,876
heroin into the United States,
and he's been doing so,

1754
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:16,517
on a regular basis, since 1969!

1755
02:03:16,743 --> 02:03:18,530
I have cases against every member

1756
02:03:18,746 --> 02:03:20,488
- of his organization.
- His organization?

1757
02:03:20,657 --> 02:03:23,502
No fucking nigger has accomplished what
the American Mafia hasnt

1758
02:03:23,701 --> 02:03:24,758
in a hundred years!

1759
02:03:24,935 --> 02:03:26,139
And you'd know that how?

1760
02:03:26,279 --> 02:03:28,189
Cause your head is stuck up
your fuckin ass?

1761
02:03:28,463 --> 02:03:30,652
Lou, do me a favor,
get this fucking kike out of here.

1762
02:03:31,338 --> 02:03:32,377
Kike?

1763
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:40,378
Make it stick.

1764
02:03:41,254 --> 02:03:43,663
Spearman's with the coffins,
about a quarter mile away.

1765
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:15,875
Doctor!

1766
02:04:18,024 --> 02:04:19,064
What?

1767
02:04:19,732 --> 02:04:22,638
Fucking Trupo came by the house.
It's bad.

1768
02:04:38,829 --> 02:04:40,829
I need to speak with you
a minute, please.

1769
02:04:41,029 --> 02:04:43,178
- Sit down just a minute.
- I have to go.

1770
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:45,522
Would you come back a little later?

1771
02:04:46,451 --> 02:04:47,850
- Thank you.
- Ma, I gotta go.

1772
02:04:48,009 --> 02:04:50,676
- Just a few words.
- Listen to me, I got...

1773
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:53,034
Please sit down.
Just a few words.

1774
02:04:53,608 --> 02:04:55,486
I've been thinking about some things.

1775
02:04:55,744 --> 02:04:57,351
If you had been a preacher,

1776
02:04:57,551 --> 02:04:59,386
your brothers
would have been preachers.

1777
02:05:00,007 --> 02:05:03,268
If you had been a soldier,
they'd be soldiers, you know that.

1778
02:05:03,653 --> 02:05:05,742
They all came here because of you.

1779
02:05:06,302 --> 02:05:08,637
- You called and they came, right?
- Right.

1780
02:05:08,889 --> 02:05:11,575
That's because they look up to you.

1781
02:05:12,565 --> 02:05:16,406
They always expect you
to know what's best.

1782
02:05:17,086 --> 02:05:18,556
But even they know...

1783
02:05:19,276 --> 02:05:20,738
you don't shoot cops!

1784
02:05:23,208 --> 02:05:24,586
Even I know that.

1785
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:27,474
- Heaven knows it.
- Right.

1786
02:05:27,633 --> 02:05:30,128
The only one who doesn't
seem to know is you!

1787
02:05:30,297 --> 02:05:31,600
- All right, Ma.
- It's...

1788
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:33,529
I promise you
I won't shoot anyone.

1789
02:05:33,704 --> 02:05:36,305
I never asked you
where all this came from.

1790
02:05:36,504 --> 02:05:38,962
- cause I didn't want to hear you lie.
- Don't you worry about it.

1791
02:05:39,096 --> 02:05:40,986
- I gotta go.
- Don't lie to me!

1792
02:05:45,654 --> 02:05:46,892
Don't do that.

1793
02:05:48,199 --> 02:05:49,785
- Come on.
- Do you want to...

1794
02:05:50,417 --> 02:05:51,947
make things so bad

1795
02:05:52,188 --> 02:05:54,081
for your family
that they'll leave you?

1796
02:05:54,227 --> 02:05:56,034
- Cause they will.
- I understand.

1797
02:05:56,191 --> 02:05:58,252
She will leave

1798
02:05:58,442 --> 02:05:59,815
-  you.
- All right.

1799
02:06:02,606 --> 02:06:03,771
I will leave you.

1800
02:06:31,923 --> 02:06:33,526
Coffins on the move, Richie.

1801
02:06:33,672 --> 02:06:36,749
We want the transport coffins,
not the ceremonial ones.

1802
02:06:38,102 --> 02:06:39,475
Who are these guys?

1803
02:06:42,048 --> 02:06:43,211
What does it say?

1804
02:06:46,332 --> 02:06:49,373
- Bayo Custodial Services?
- Bayon?

1805
02:06:49,572 --> 02:06:51,044
Bayon Cleaning Services?

1806
02:06:51,313 --> 02:06:53,343
Looks like that.
Get it on camera, Al.

1807
02:06:56,315 --> 02:06:57,355
Bingo.

1808
02:06:57,849 --> 02:07:00,258
Holy shit, that's the baseball kid.

1809
02:07:00,631 --> 02:07:03,988
- Oh yeah, that's Stevie Lucas.
- So, what you wanna do?

1810
02:07:04,221 --> 02:07:05,265
Follow the trucks?

1811
02:07:05,421 --> 02:07:07,452
No, I want to stay here
with the Lucas kid.

1812
02:07:08,492 --> 02:07:09,925
We'll follow that van.

1813
02:07:10,785 --> 02:07:13,184
You guys better eat up,
we'll have a long night.

1814
02:07:24,964 --> 02:07:28,063
More precious that gold, man.
This is more precious than gold.

1815
02:07:28,774 --> 02:07:30,923
A couple more, let's go.
Stack that up!

1816
02:07:32,032 --> 02:07:33,083
Take it.

1817
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:35,440
- Take it.
- Give me a second.

1818
02:07:37,893 --> 02:07:41,104
Hey yo, we got four caskets left.
Let's make some money here.

1819
02:07:44,155 --> 02:07:46,517
- They're loading in there.
- What the fuck they're loadin?

1820
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:48,531
- That's the dope.
- That's gotta be it.

1821
02:07:49,444 --> 02:07:50,598
That's gotta be.

1822
02:07:51,549 --> 02:07:52,589
Let's go.

1823
02:07:53,478 --> 02:07:54,532
Let's move.

1824
02:08:47,533 --> 02:08:48,705
<i>Lou, it's Richie.</i>

1825
02:08:49,034 --> 02:08:50,432
<i>Get everybody in place.</i>

1826
02:08:51,129 --> 02:08:52,881
<i>- Everybody.
- You're sure this is it?</i>

1827
02:08:53,017 --> 02:08:54,290
I'm positive, OK?

1828
02:08:55,065 --> 02:08:56,408
They're cutting and bagging

1829
02:08:56,752 --> 02:08:59,478
in the south tower of the Stephen Crane
projects right now.

1830
02:08:59,985 --> 02:09:02,134
<i>Are you sure this is it?
You're positive?</i>

1831
02:09:02,426 --> 02:09:04,709
<i>Positive, Lou,
I'm positive, okay?</i>

1832
02:09:04,894 --> 02:09:07,185
<i>Everything's ready to go,
all the guys are ready to go,</i>

1833
02:09:07,374 --> 02:09:09,614
just push the button,
gimme the warrant, okay?

1834
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:11,323
Okay, you got it.

1835
02:10:13,116 --> 02:10:14,920
- I got the warrant.
- All right.

1836
02:10:18,829 --> 02:10:19,838
Let's go!

1837
02:10:36,998 --> 02:10:37,976
Move.

1838
02:10:41,290 --> 02:10:43,658
- M'am, what's your name?
- What's going on?

1839
02:10:45,035 --> 02:10:47,151
Get down!
Down, motherfucker!

1840
02:10:49,504 --> 02:10:50,762
Let's go, Al.

1841
02:10:51,172 --> 02:10:52,210
C'mon.

1842
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:55,149
C'mon, move it.

1843
02:11:37,944 --> 02:11:38,892
All set.

1844
02:11:39,881 --> 02:11:40,924
Roger.

1845
02:11:43,873 --> 02:11:44,849
Here you go.

1846
02:11:47,752 --> 02:11:48,647
C'mon!

1847
02:11:56,844 --> 02:11:57,877
At target.

1848
02:11:58,831 --> 02:12:00,841
Spearman, stand by.

1849
02:12:01,434 --> 02:12:03,720
<i>I got civilians on the target floor.</i>

1850
02:12:06,450 --> 02:12:07,370
What?

1851
02:12:08,431 --> 02:12:09,661
Fuck, here you go.

1852
02:12:10,292 --> 02:12:11,520
Hey, Tim.

1853
02:12:11,801 --> 02:12:13,811
Girl, put some clothes on.

1854
02:12:14,253 --> 02:12:16,770
You'll catch a cold out here
walking like this.

1855
02:12:22,811 --> 02:12:24,411
What's happenin, Suzie?

1856
02:12:33,145 --> 02:12:34,482
Where you goin?

1857
02:12:35,181 --> 02:12:36,241
Come on.

1858
02:12:38,393 --> 02:12:39,677
I'll get it.

1859
02:12:42,076 --> 02:12:43,313
Where's Tim?

1860
02:12:44,288 --> 02:12:45,335
Quiet, kid.

1861
02:12:52,387 --> 02:12:54,477
Yo, some sandwiches
for the boys, man.

1862
02:12:57,319 --> 02:12:58,454
Where is Tim?

1863
02:12:59,818 --> 02:13:01,291
Tim's always playing around.

1864
02:13:02,682 --> 02:13:03,686
Hey man!

1865
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:06,432
You got some Blue Magic?

1866
02:13:07,915 --> 02:13:09,275
Fucking junkie.

1867
02:13:10,236 --> 02:13:11,590
Yo, handle that!

1868
02:13:11,961 --> 02:13:13,791
C'mon, I got money, man!

1869
02:13:14,024 --> 02:13:15,076
You know me, baby!

1870
02:13:15,278 --> 02:13:17,952
C'mon, I need that Blue Magic, man!

1871
02:13:18,082 --> 02:13:19,558
It's me, baby!

1872
02:13:19,817 --> 02:13:21,807
You know me, I got money.

1873
02:13:22,890 --> 02:13:24,900
Get outa here.
Fuckin junkie!

1874
02:13:26,711 --> 02:13:27,628
Police!

1875
02:13:29,050 --> 02:13:30,381
- Drop it!
- Get down!

1876
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:32,039
- Drop your gun!
- Don't do it!

1877
02:13:32,178 --> 02:13:33,650
- Drop your gun!
- Don't do it!

1878
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,943
Scotty!

1879
02:13:40,611 --> 02:13:42,076
- Freeze!
- Police!

1880
02:13:44,853 --> 02:13:46,107
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1881
02:13:48,305 --> 02:13:49,409
Nobody moves!

1882
02:13:49,549 --> 02:13:50,822
Don't let'em get away!

1883
02:13:59,921 --> 02:14:00,949
Fuckin move!

1884
02:14:11,623 --> 02:14:13,596
I wanna see your hands!
All the hands!

1885
02:14:13,792 --> 02:14:14,707
Police!

1886
02:14:18,498 --> 02:14:20,348
Down! Get down!

1887
02:14:20,589 --> 02:14:21,942
Stay the fuck there!

1888
02:15:21,650 --> 02:15:22,697
What the hell?

1889
02:15:35,730 --> 02:15:37,839
Stay down!
Down, motherfucker!

1890
02:15:38,241 --> 02:15:39,256
Hands!

1891
02:15:44,663 --> 02:15:46,036
Out of home, baby.

1892
02:15:57,528 --> 02:15:59,497
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1893
02:16:00,023 --> 02:16:01,395
You all wait right here.

1894
02:16:27,339 --> 02:16:28,934
Lucas,
please step back inside.

1895
02:16:29,868 --> 02:16:31,340
Please, step inside.

1896
02:16:31,522 --> 02:16:33,751
Respectfully, please,
step inside. Thank you.

1897
02:16:46,975 --> 02:16:48,032
Stay back!

1898
02:16:56,766 --> 02:16:58,081
Yo, the pigs.

1899
02:16:59,083 --> 02:17:01,106
NYPD, everybody stay still.

1900
02:17:04,271 --> 02:17:05,484
Turner! Go!

1901
02:17:43,050 --> 02:17:44,131
"Dead servicemen..."

1902
02:17:44,304 --> 02:17:47,627
"Dead servicemen
trying to defend our country..."

1903
02:17:58,936 --> 02:18:02,765
Ladies and gentlemen, at this stage
of the proceedings, the counsels

1904
02:18:03,045 --> 02:18:05,154
are ready for their opening statements.

1905
02:18:05,543 --> 02:18:07,058
For the prosecution,

1906
02:18:07,278 --> 02:18:08,650
Mr. Roberts will proceed

1907
02:18:08,885 --> 02:18:10,895
with his opening statement first.

1908
02:18:11,392 --> 02:18:12,657
Mr. Roberts!

1909
02:18:13,962 --> 02:18:15,564
Are you ready to proceed?

1910
02:18:17,037 --> 02:18:18,284
Yes, your Honor.

1911
02:18:22,695 --> 02:18:24,686
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

1912
02:18:29,601 --> 02:18:32,632
The State will show,
and you will hear

1913
02:18:33,489 --> 02:18:36,653
that Frank Lucas
is the most dangerous man

1914
02:18:37,498 --> 02:18:39,355
walking the streets of our city.

1915
02:18:42,501 --> 02:18:44,242
You all get on out.
Let me

1916
02:18:44,806 --> 02:18:46,477
talk to Mr. Richie alone.

1917
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:52,035
C'mon, I pay you by the hour,
not by the minute.

1918
02:18:55,963 --> 02:18:57,029
Thank you.

1919
02:19:01,906 --> 02:19:03,558
You ain't wearin a wire?

1920
02:19:08,167 --> 02:19:12,281
I was talking to my lawyers,
they said something I can't believe.

1921
02:19:13,991 --> 02:19:15,370
Did you really

1922
02:19:15,607 --> 02:19:17,478
find a million $ in the trunk of a car

1923
02:19:17,677 --> 02:19:19,099
- and then turn it in?
- Yeah.

1924
02:19:19,259 --> 02:19:21,589
You did that for real, huh?
My man!

1925
02:19:21,949 --> 02:19:23,780
Good for you.
Shit...

1926
02:19:24,103 --> 02:19:26,050
You know johnny law
got the dough, right?

1927
02:19:26,209 --> 02:19:28,204
- Maybe.
- Ain't no "maybe", Mr. Richie.

1928
02:19:28,382 --> 02:19:30,540
You know he got it.
You turned that money in,

1929
02:19:30,759 --> 02:19:33,075
he took it, and you ain't
gettin nothin for it, did you?

1930
02:19:33,452 --> 02:19:34,881
Why did you do that?

1931
02:19:35,374 --> 02:19:37,889
- It was the right thing to do.
- It's true.

1932
02:19:38,235 --> 02:19:40,736
Good answer, it was the right thing.
The question I have

1933
02:19:40,967 --> 02:19:44,016
that I've been asking myself
is would you do it again?

1934
02:19:45,109 --> 02:19:47,339
That's a lot of money
and a long time ago.

1935
02:19:48,553 --> 02:19:52,325
Many car payments ago.
Many child support payments ago.

1936
02:19:53,883 --> 02:19:57,501
So I said to myself the only way
to find out is to find out.

1937
02:19:59,145 --> 02:20:00,242
<i>Bribery,</i>

1938
02:20:00,990 --> 02:20:02,741
extortion, murder,

1939
02:20:03,368 --> 02:20:04,785
racketeering...

1940
02:20:07,017 --> 02:20:08,484
<i>If you would give me an address,</i>

1941
02:20:08,703 --> 02:20:11,111
<i>I'll make sure the car's there,
and the money's in that trunk.</i>

1942
02:20:12,348 --> 02:20:13,578
No, thanks.

1943
02:20:14,206 --> 02:20:15,409
You sure?

1944
02:20:17,187 --> 02:20:19,425
C'mon now,
what you think, that impresses me?

1945
02:20:19,974 --> 02:20:22,859
You think you're better than them,
you're no better than them other cops,

1946
02:20:23,024 --> 02:20:24,232
You're the same as them.

1947
02:20:24,461 --> 02:20:25,647
You are them.

1948
02:20:26,408 --> 02:20:27,625
Let me ask you this.

1949
02:20:27,809 --> 02:20:30,823
Do you really think
that putting me behind bars

1950
02:20:31,022 --> 02:20:32,778
will change anything on the streets?

1951
02:20:32,928 --> 02:20:36,549
Them dope fiends are going to shoot it,
steal from it, and die for it.

1952
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:38,939
Putting me in or out
won't change anything.

1953
02:20:40,321 --> 02:20:43,157
- That's the way it is.
- Right, so what we got, Richie?

1954
02:20:43,505 --> 02:20:45,298
We got me and you sitting here.

1955
02:20:45,788 --> 02:20:48,434
<i>You got that snitch ass
driving for my brother,</i>

1956
02:20:48,588 --> 02:20:50,351
<i>you got a little bit of powder.</i>

1957
02:20:50,626 --> 02:20:52,166
<i>You gonna need more than that.</i>

1958
02:20:52,321 --> 02:20:55,287
<i>I got possession, supply,
conspiracy...</i>

1959
02:20:56,355 --> 02:20:57,603
<i>bribing a law officer.</i>

1960
02:20:57,765 --> 02:20:59,920
<i>I got people attesting
to seeing you kill in cold blood.</i>

1961
02:21:00,457 --> 02:21:02,108
<i>I got your offshore bank accounts,</i>

1962
02:21:02,259 --> 02:21:03,832
<i>your real estate, your businesses.</i>

1963
02:21:04,459 --> 02:21:06,234
All bought with money from heroin.

1964
02:21:07,616 --> 02:21:09,939
I got hundreds of parents
of dead kids

1965
02:21:10,404 --> 02:21:13,096
addicts who o'ded on your product,
and that's my story for the jury,

1966
02:21:13,235 --> 02:21:16,432
that's how I make it all stick.
This man murdered thousands of people.

1967
02:21:16,591 --> 02:21:18,661
And he did it from a penthouse,
driving a Lincoln.

1968
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:20,745
besides that,
you got nothing to worry about.

1969
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:23,565
That's pretty good,
but that's why we go to court, right?

1970
02:21:23,695 --> 02:21:25,048
Cause I got witnesses too.

1971
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:27,529
I got celebrities,
I got sport figures,

1972
02:21:27,693 --> 02:21:29,244
I got Harlem, Richie.

1973
02:21:30,153 --> 02:21:33,585
I took care of Harlem, so it's gonna
take care of me, you can believe that.

1974
02:21:33,831 --> 02:21:35,731
- I got more than that.
- What you got?

1975
02:21:36,195 --> 02:21:38,873
I got a line of people
wanting to testify against you

1976
02:21:39,024 --> 02:21:40,955
that stretches out the door
and around the block.

1977
02:21:41,175 --> 02:21:43,822
<i>- Bullshit.
- You damaged a lot of lives, Frank.</i>

1978
02:21:44,368 --> 02:21:47,090
<i>I got the Mazzano crime family.
You put them out of business.</i>

1979
02:21:47,230 --> 02:21:49,697
I got nothin to do with 'em.
They got nothin to do with me.

1980
02:21:49,856 --> 02:21:51,701
They got everything to do with you.
Know why?

1981
02:21:51,860 --> 02:21:52,855
Why?

1982
02:21:53,074 --> 02:21:55,362
Because
apart from the fact they hate you,

1983
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:58,412
- they hate what you represent.
- I don't represent nothing

1984
02:21:58,596 --> 02:22:00,480
- but Frank Lucas.
- You sure?

1985
02:22:00,823 --> 02:22:02,475
A black businessman like you.

1986
02:22:03,045 --> 02:22:04,815
You represent progress.

1987
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:08,230
The kind that's gonna see them
lose a lot of money.

1988
02:22:08,962 --> 02:22:10,539
With you out of the way,

1989
02:22:10,788 --> 02:22:12,798
everything can return to normal.

1990
02:22:13,554 --> 02:22:14,627
My man.

1991
02:22:19,594 --> 02:22:21,719
You know what normal is to me?

1992
02:22:22,027 --> 02:22:24,503
I ain't see normal
since I was 6 years old.

1993
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:29,202
Normal is seeing the police
ride up to my house,

1994
02:22:29,353 --> 02:22:32,318
dragging my 12 year old cousin out
and tying him to a pole.

1995
02:22:32,532 --> 02:22:35,278
Shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

1996
02:22:35,472 --> 02:22:38,516
Then they bust two shotgun shells
in his head, knocking it off.

1997
02:22:38,660 --> 02:22:40,130
That's what normal is to me.

1998
02:22:40,429 --> 02:22:41,862
Didn't give a fuck about no...

1999
02:22:42,650 --> 02:22:45,133
police then. Don't give a fuck
about no police now.

2000
02:22:45,408 --> 02:22:46,423
Shit.

2001
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:48,895
You can do whatever you wanna do.

2002
02:22:49,126 --> 02:22:51,632
So it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow

2003
02:22:51,796 --> 02:22:53,651
with your head blown off,
you understand?

2004
02:22:54,599 --> 02:22:55,787
Hey, Frank.

2005
02:22:56,088 --> 02:22:57,168
Get in line,

2006
02:22:57,742 --> 02:22:59,934
That one
stretches around the block, too.

2007
02:23:03,469 --> 02:23:04,526
All right.

2008
02:23:08,581 --> 02:23:09,877
What you wanna do?

2009
02:23:16,645 --> 02:23:18,190
You know what you gotta do.

2010
02:23:18,436 --> 02:23:20,108
What you want me to do ?
Snitch?

2011
02:23:20,287 --> 02:23:23,830
I know you don't want no cops.
What you want? Gangsters?

2012
02:23:24,258 --> 02:23:25,338
Pick one.

2013
02:23:25,553 --> 02:23:27,662
Jew gangsters, mick gangsters,
guinees?

2014
02:23:28,222 --> 02:23:30,961
They been bleeding Harlem dry
since they got off the boat.

2015
02:23:31,174 --> 02:23:33,433
I don't give a fuck
about no crime figures.

2016
02:23:33,867 --> 02:23:34,900
You can have them.

2017
02:23:35,999 --> 02:23:37,439
I'll take them too.

2018
02:23:37,656 --> 02:23:39,398
You'll take them too?

2019
02:23:44,695 --> 02:23:45,928
No you didn't.

2020
02:23:46,090 --> 02:23:48,128
You talkin about police?
You want police?

2021
02:23:49,105 --> 02:23:51,572
- You want your own kind?
- They're not my kind.

2022
02:23:52,226 --> 02:23:54,336
They're in business with you,
they ain't my kind.

2023
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:58,325
They ain't my kind
like the Italians are not yours.

2024
02:24:12,545 --> 02:24:14,367
What can you promise me, Richie?

2025
02:24:17,957 --> 02:24:20,799
I can promise you,
you lie about one name...

2026
02:24:21,401 --> 02:24:23,069
You'll never get out of prison.

2027
02:24:23,438 --> 02:24:26,182
You lie about one dollar,
one offshore account.

2028
02:24:26,493 --> 02:24:28,046
You'll never get out of prison.

2029
02:24:29,574 --> 02:24:31,862
You can live life rich in jail

2030
02:24:32,144 --> 02:24:34,021
the rest of your boring days,

2031
02:24:34,426 --> 02:24:36,745
or be poor outside for some of them.

2032
02:24:37,911 --> 02:24:39,797
That's what I can promise you.

2033
02:24:42,955 --> 02:24:44,685
<i>I want them cops, Richie.</i>

2034
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:49,283
That's what I want,
I want them cops

2035
02:24:50,786 --> 02:24:53,213
that took money out of my pockets.

2036
02:24:56,582 --> 02:24:57,636
Him too.

2037
02:24:58,161 --> 02:24:59,408
All right.

2038
02:25:02,130 --> 02:25:03,592
Hey, Spearman.

2039
02:25:04,850 --> 02:25:07,620
These guys are all connected
on the grid.

2040
02:25:07,936 --> 02:25:10,245
This guy here, he's in uniform.

2041
02:25:11,384 --> 02:25:14,707
<i>Police officers were arrested
today on charges of taking bribes</i>

2042
02:25:14,866 --> 02:25:17,248
<i>- from drug traffickers.
- Well done, Jimmy!</i>

2043
02:25:17,688 --> 02:25:19,658
<i>The investigation into police corruption</i>

<i>broadened today with the arrest...</i>

2046
02:25:24,704 --> 02:25:27,549
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

Trupo.

2065
02:26:22,667 --> 02:26:23,895
You are special.

2066
02:27:07,873 --> 02:27:09,355
It's good work, Frank.

2067
02:27:10,866 --> 02:27:11,882
You know...

2068
02:27:12,529 --> 02:27:14,710
You don't want a drink or somethin'?

2069
02:27:15,027 --> 02:27:16,139
To celebrate.

2070
02:27:16,593 --> 02:27:18,164
You got any holy water?

2071
02:28:12,475 --> 02:28:13,701
