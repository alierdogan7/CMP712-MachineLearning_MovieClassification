1
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,253
One fine spring day...

2
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,991
a disciple looked at some branches
blowing in the wind.

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,533
He asked his master...

4
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:14,334
"Master, are the branches moving
or is it the wind?"

5
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,539
Not even glancing to where
his pupil was pointing...

6
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,839
the master smiled and said...

7
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:26,919
"That which moves is neither
the branches nor the wind..."

8
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,544
"It's your heart and mind."

9
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,130
Sunwoo, you should
go downstairs for a moment.

10
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,140
Why?

11
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,437
There's some trouble.

12
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,907
Okay, I'll handle it.

13
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,621
I'm sorry, but
business hours are over.

14
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,997
Please get up and leave
before I count to three. One.

15
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,103
Two.

16
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,880
Three!

17
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,082
Sit down, stupid!

18
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,581
Min-gi, lock the door.

19
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,869
You son of a bitch!

20
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,321
See you tomorrow.

21
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,327
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

22
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:13,240
Yes, boss. I'll transfer
the money in the morning.

23
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,441
All right, we'll close
for the night, sir.

24
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,323
So, did you take care
of yesterday's business?

25
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,299
Yes, sir.

26
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,530
Good. You always seem
to get things done.

27
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,444
It looks like Chairman Baek's son
is the one making trouble.

28
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,846
Yes, it didn't seem like
Chairman Baek did it himself.

29
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,885
Chairman Baek's son used
to be a loan shark...

30
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,217
I heard he's interested
in this business.

31
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,346
Abalone, sir.

32
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,585
There's talk that he started
dealings with Southeast Asia.

33
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,592
Why?

34
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:43,696
He's pushing businesses to hire
Filipina girls instead of Russians.

35
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,230
Assholes. Like father, like son.

36
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:50,874
It's me...

37
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,268
Moon Suk.

38
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,879
I shouldn't have brought my car...

39
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,577
I hope I'm not interrupting?

40
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:01,885
Oh, it's okay.

41
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,020
What's that? Abalone?

42
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,523
Get another for me.

43
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,114
Yes, sir.

44
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,524
Hey, sorry about yesterday.

45
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,394
I can't believe that happened.
I just stepped out for a second.

46
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,266
You must have been busy
enough upstairs.

47
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,268
Those guys yesterday
were just local boys.

48
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,743
Nothing to worry about, sir.

49
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,937
What do you think you're doing?

50
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,608
Sir?

51
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,242
Is this how you do business?

52
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,781
- It was just...
- Get out now.

53
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,288
Get out and wait for me!

54
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,179
Be smart.

55
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,309
Things are going good for you now.

56
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,921
But the world is not easy.

57
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:14,119
You can do 100 things right, but
one mistake can destroy everything.

58
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,985
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

59
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,957
I'll try to sort things out
with Chairman Baek.

60
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:26,528
Anyhow, the real reason
I asked you here...

61
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:30,565
I have to go to Shanghai
tomorrow afternoon on business...

62
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,941
I have a favor to ask
before I leave.

63
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,274
The thing is...

64
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,419
Pour me a drink.

65
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,422
Oh, yes, sir. Sorry.

66
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,996
The truth is,

67
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,167
I have a young girlfriend.

68
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,771
Someone I really care about.

69
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,939
She's not like you and me.
She's a special kind of person.

70
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,620
What, am I boring you?

71
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,950
Uh... Congratulations, sir.

72
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,926
Never mind "Congratulations."

73
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,828
The problem is, I think
She's seeing a new guy.

74
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,695
Some young guy is hanging around her.

75
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,395
It's driving me crazy,
and I couldn't tell anyone else.

76
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,031
You know, you're the only one
I can really talk to about this.

77
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,245
No one else knows how much
this worries me.

78
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,376
So, I'd like you to watch Heesoo
for just three days.

79
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,879
Watch her?

80
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,547
Watch over her.
Take care of her.

81
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,251
See if she's really seeing someone.

82
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,260
Maybe the bastard's just bothering her.

83
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,161
See whether she's given him
her body and soul and all.

84
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:05,962
You know young people,
a hand could brush a shoulder...

85
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,563
then they hold hands, then kiss,
and then... you know...

86
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,506
These things happen.

87
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,944
But I can't stand thinking
about her like that.

88
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,943
Stupid, isn't it?

89
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,112
No, sir.

90
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,179
Stupid.

91
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,692
So... I want you to find out
who she's meeting.

92
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,126
And what she does when they meet.

93
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,686
Just for 3 days.

94
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,401
This is Heesoo's address
and phone number.

95
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:44,640
I hope she's not seeing him,
but if she is...

96
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,669
If they look like they're involved...

97
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,648
Call me right away.
Or finish them off yourself.

98
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,275
Excuse me?

99
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,152
You know I can't stand
being lied to, right?

100
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,124
Love isn't love if you're
being lied to.

101
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,387
You can contact me here
in Shanghai.

102
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,553
Directly.

103
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,862
Have a good night.

104
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,064
Do you have a girlfriend?

105
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,662
No, sir.

106
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,904
Have you ever been in love?

107
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,911
No, you haven't.

108
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,176
That's why I'm entrusting you
with this job.

109
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,217
That's why I like you.

110
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,552
Okay, let's go.

111
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,785
Goodbye, sir!

112
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,422
President Kang told me
to give this to you personally.

113
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,289
I'm sorry?

114
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,590
President Kang told me
to give this to you personally.

115
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,494
What's that?

116
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,772
Wow, it's so funny-looking.

117
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,942
It's so like Mr. Kang.

118
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,002
It's cute.

119
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,274
Don't you think so?

120
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,445
Hello, not yet.

121
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,252
Already? Hold on a second...

122
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,260
President Kang also said
I should drive you today.

123
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,098
Oh, I don't need a ride.
You can go, it's fine.

124
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,562
- He said I should take you myself.
- I'll let him know about it.

125
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,168
Well, then, I'll see you later.

126
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:20,446
If you need anything,
please contact me here.

127
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,214
It's okay, I don't need it.

128
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,590
Oh, give it to me anyway.

129
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,856
Goodbye.

130
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,908
Heesoo, Heesoo.

131
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,834
They sure like to get around...
Maybe it's because they're still young?

132
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,076
Why isn't she getting out?

133
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,459
Hey, Moon Suk.
Everything okay?

134
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:54,895
What?

135
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,070
President Baek, that asshole...

136
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,971
He keeps calling and bothering me.

137
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,975
Asking how could we do this to him.

138
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,944
He says he lost face
because of you.

139
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,811
He wants to meet you.

140
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:17,516
I said no, his guys were to blame.

141
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,355
But he insists on meeting you.

142
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,862
He's calling me every 10 minutes.

143
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,794
I think you should...

144
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,059
What the...
Who's bugging me now?

145
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,503
See? He's calling again.
I'm sick of getting it.

146
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,131
You take care of it now.

147
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,222
Hello, this is Kim Sunwoo.

148
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,636
Well, if you have something to say,
Come here and tell me yourself.

149
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,193
I'm hanging up.

150
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,506
I took care of it.

151
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:17,146
Hello, hello.
He... hello? Hello?

152
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,151
Fucker, hung up on me.

153
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,017
What a rude bastard. Hello?

154
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,180
Should I...?

155
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,518
Leave it!

156
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:41,535
Laughing? You think that's funny?
Funny huh?

157
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,107
You go around smiling like an idiot...
That's why you get your ass kicked.

158
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,808
Damn you bastard, look at me.

159
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,180
Look at me, damn it.

160
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,613
Funny?

161
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,015
I'm sorry, sir.

162
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,757
Do you think it's funny?

163
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,228
Funny, funny, funny?

164
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,288
Funny?

165
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,231
Shit!

166
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,936
What hell were you thinking?
You're making it even worse!

167
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,217
Hey, this is your job.

168
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,347
I took care of it
because you weren't there.

169
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,187
This kind of thing is your job.
You should've taken care of it.

170
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,454
They just want to do business
with us...

171
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:40,726
...and beat us to the punch
before starting to deal.

172
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,266
Don't you get it?

173
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,461
What are you lecturing me now?

174
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,033
Hey, get the phone over here.

175
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,194
Yes sir.

176
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,232
Here, sir.

177
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,014
What an idiot.

178
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,676
What? Is this voice dial?

179
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,752
Don't you think we need
to press the numbers?

180
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,653
Should I dial it with my mouth?

181
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,761
Stupid motherfuckers.

182
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,967
Call Moosung from Samseongyo.

183
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,006
Yes, sir.

184
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,784
You didn't answer your mobile,
so I'm leaving this message.

185
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:46,813
If you have some time, I need
your help for a little while.

186
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:51,352
Just until 3 in the afternoon.
After that, it's fine.

187
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,954
If you get this message...

188
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,430
Yes, it's me. It's Sunwoo.

189
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:59,562
Ah, yes. At what time? And right now it's...

190
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,597
I'll be there in an hour
at the latest.

191
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,107
I'm on my way.

192
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:36,533
Mr. Kang said you're a scary guy.

193
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,074
Excuse me?

194
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:40,770
He did?

195
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,544
Yes...

196
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,048
You're an enforcer, aren't you?

197
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,787
I gave you my card the other day.

198
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,355
I work at a hotel.

199
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,031
So you're an enforcer for the hotel?

200
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,404
I'm not that kind of person.

201
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,108
You're so boring to talk to.

202
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,863
Can I ask you something?

203
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,159
Sure.

204
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,302
How did you first meet Mr. Kang?

205
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,861
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

206
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,599
How much is the red lamp?

207
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,473
$280

208
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,979
$280?

209
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,914
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

210
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,017
Let's go.

211
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,516
What were you saying?

212
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,563
You asked why I am seeing Mr. Kang?

213
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,327
Yes.

214
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,997
Why do you want to know?

215
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:16,398
It's just... you don't have
to answer.

216
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,872
- Hello.
- Hello.

217
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,115
I'll take that now.

218
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,555
I'm sorry.

219
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,927
For what?

220
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,194
Asking you those questions.

221
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,834
It's okay.

222
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,631
Thanks for your time today.
I didn't want to eat by myself.

223
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,677
If you'd like to take a look,
you can enter through that door.

224
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,211
How will you return home?

225
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,477
It's easy to catch a cab here.

226
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,427
You guys ready?

227
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,193
- Yeah, ready.
- Okay

228
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,535
Let's go.

229
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,683
Hi, Min-gi.

230
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,879
Someone came to see you
early this morning.

231
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:43,852
Who was it?

232
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,117
Oh Moosung. Do you know him?
He's one mean-looking guy.

233
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,056
Moosung? I don't know him.

234
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,559
Anything else?

235
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,993
Moon Suk is looking for you.
You want to talk to him now?

236
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,998
No, Min-gi, don't put him through.

237
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,731
I'll be going to the hotel soon.

238
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,842
Well, well, well.

239
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,214
Bottoms up.

240
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,839
Someone's coming.

241
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,476
Hey, Sunwoo, come over here.

242
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,814
Sunwoo?

243
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,144
Hello.

244
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,212
Come here, come.

245
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,120
Come.

246
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,488
Why don't you come over
here for a second?

247
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,788
Ji-hyun, this is Mr. Kim's seat.

248
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,387
Come.

249
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,299
Have a seat.

250
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,769
Hey, why are you always so
secretive about the thing you do?

251
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,305
What's up?

252
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,440
Have a drink.

253
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,601
Girls, get out.

254
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,665
What are you doing?

255
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,076
Don't ruin the fun.
Relax.

256
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,206
Say hello to President Baek.

257
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,546
From the Baek-Sang Management Agency.

258
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,522
Hi. I'm sorry I was rude
the other day.

259
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,353
- I guess we had a misunderstanding.
- Is that why you came here?

260
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,687
Yes, that and...

261
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,888
There was no misunderstanding.

262
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,954
Who do you think we are?

263
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,059
- Hey, Sunwoo!
- You be quiet.

264
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,602
Don't use your people
to mess with me anymore.

265
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:07,695
Sunwoo!

266
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,231
He's here as my guest today!

267
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:16,671
Damn it, how could you
do this to me?

268
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,375
I can do this because it's you.

269
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:31,555
Kim Sunwoo, do you think
the world is all yours?

270
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,159
Don't do anything you'll regret.

271
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,152
Aren't you going?

272
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,353
- You go first.
- See you.

273
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,904
Heesoo.

274
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,478
Hi.

275
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,717
Did you have a good date today?

276
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,252
Stop kidding.

277
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,721
Where did you say
you'd sleep tonight?

278
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,489
Thanks.

279
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,497
How should we do this?

280
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,363
I will call you tomorrow.

281
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,063
Just call me...

282
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,860
Yeah, Min-gi.

283
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,401
That asshole can't drive for shit!

284
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,032
I wasn't talking...

285
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,678
I wasn't talking to you.

286
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,674
What about Moon Suk?

287
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,445
Did you go down to the club?

288
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,647
Ok.

289
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,432
Who is it?

290
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,749
Who is it?

291
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,636
Seyoon, don't!

292
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,082
Seyoon!

293
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,609
Stop it!

294
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,022
You bastard!

295
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,630
You know who I'm calling, don't you?

296
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,106
Any last words?

297
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,095
You finish them off yourself.

298
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,015
Okay. This is what we'll do.

299
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,791
I'll give you a chance.

300
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,093
Listen. Both of you.

301
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,356
You must never see each other again.

302
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,869
All this today never happened
for any of us, including me...

303
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,734
This moment never existed.

304
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,207
Erase it completely.

305
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,573
Not just from your memories,
but from your habits, too.

306
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,540
Don't say it's hard...

307
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,141
Because this can get more serious
than either of you can imagine.

308
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,448
No point thinking about it
any longer so...

309
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,214
You, hurry, get dressed and leave.

310
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,687
Seyoon, don't do this.

311
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,226
- Seyoon!
- Heesoo, Heesoo.

312
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:28,436
Heesoo.

313
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,303
- Leave me alone!
- Listen to me!

314
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,398
Let me go!

315
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,048
Do you really believe we can just
forget about what happened here tonight?

316
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,913
- This...
- Do you... really... think so?

317
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:45,445
I was just looking
for the best way out of this.

318
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,322
Okay, you can go now.

319
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,758
Heesoo.

320
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,058
I don't have anything else to say.

321
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,197
You understand I can't say
anything, right?

322
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,396
Should I thank you
for saving my life or something?

323
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:07,009
Please leave now.
I'll do as you say.

324
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,678
Heesoo.

325
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,380
That's not the way it is.

326
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,715
You know it can't be erased.

327
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,121
Hey, open the window.

328
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,562
Hey!

329
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,846
That fucking asshole!

330
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,095
What's wrong with that guy?

331
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,696
Hey!

332
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,575
Asshole!

333
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,370
Who's there?

334
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,537
Get out here,

335
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,743
you pricks!

336
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:38,213
Come on out. Now.

337
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,410
Are you alone?

338
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,616
Let's just go one-on-one then.

339
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,552
I'm Oh Moo-sung from Samseongyo.

340
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,954
Whoever the fuck you are,
just get over here.

341
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,719
I'm sick of talking.

342
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,961
Calm down.

343
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,006
I only came to give you a message.

344
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:31,905
Did Mr. Baek send you?

345
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,201
Tell me.

346
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:40,176
Apologize.
Then nothing will happen.

347
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,610
"I. Was. Wrong."
Three little words.

348
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:49,453
If you say those three words,
nothing horrible will happen.

349
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,924
"I. Was. Wrong."
Just three words.

350
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,533
Fuck. Off. Asshole.

351
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,569
Think it over.

352
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,803
Stop talking shit and
get the fuck outta here.

353
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,208
Everyone's got to live their life.

354
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,807
Aren't you going
to answer the phone?

355
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,142
It's okay, it's not important.

356
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,080
Would you like some coffee?

357
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,087
No, it's okay.
I have to go soon.

358
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,597
Come over here.

359
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,376
You look pretty upset.

360
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,745
What's wrong?

361
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,109
No, I'm ok.

362
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,313
Hey!

363
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,621
But I'm moving out.

364
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,353
I put this house up for sale.

365
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,070
Do you know why I like you?

366
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:54,342
It's because you don't care
what other people think.

367
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,605
That's interesting.

368
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,580
I used to think you were to young.

369
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,709
But I still come
to see you, like today.

370
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,151
And you still make me look for you.

371
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,653
That's what I like about you.

372
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:14,092
What do you think it is?
Being young is a gift, too.

373
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:21,898
As you get older,
you lose patience.

374
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,921
Ma'am... ma'am...

375
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,153
Ma'am... ma'am...

376
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:05,459
Ma'am... ma'am...

377
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,987
Hey, Sunwoo.

378
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:35,795
Well, well...
What's a great guy like you...

379
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,767
...doing in a place like this, huh?

380
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:46,269
Oh my, you fucked up
pretty bad, didn't you?

381
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:51,110
Do you know what you're doing now?

382
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:57,776
Shit, fucking rotten.

383
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,914
Don't waste time,
just get rid of him.

384
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:50,639
This is really gross.

385
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,539
Where's the cocky Mr. Kim now?

386
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:01,915
Smile, like a professional. Smile.

387
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:09,319
We'll never forget about this.

388
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:22,301
You have no idea what's happening.

389
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,918
Keep your fucking head down, asshole!

390
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,404
Why'd you do it?

391
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,179
Why didn't you just call me?

392
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,180
It's not like you.

393
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,554
So what was the reason?

394
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,727
Don't feel like talking?

395
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,128
Want it to end like this?

396
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,230
This is how things work
in this business.

397
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,667
Don't blame anybody.

398
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:44,511
The world's a funny place.

399
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,785
You know what?

400
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:53,380
People don't matter for shit.

401
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,720
No one can ever see
what's coming next.

402
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,195
What are you going to do?

403
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,930
Relax and just sit tight.

404
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,259
Mr. Moon.

405
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:13,575
Yes, sir. Okay.

406
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,143
The boss is giving you a chance.

407
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,644
Why didn't you tell me?

408
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:28,555
Why did you make that mistake?

409
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:36,889
If the two of them
never meet again...

410
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,226
Go on.

411
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:47,469
If they can keep that promise,
I thought it would be best.

412
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:53,809
No... not that kind of thing.
Tell me the real reason.

413
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,519
Just be honest.

414
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:03,222
Was it because of her?

415
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,790
What?

416
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,328
You can't say?

417
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,531
Put Moon back on.

418
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,438
Yes, sir. Okay.

419
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:23,912
Yes.

420
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,173
Okay, sir.

421
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,014
Grab his arms.

422
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,115
Hey, what are you doing?

423
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,883
- Let me go, asshole.
- Bring it here.

424
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,185
What are you doing?

425
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,486
Let me go,

426
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:48,326
Hey! Hey, Moon.

427
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,804
Don't do this. Don't.

428
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:01,109
- Don't do this.
- Hold him tight.

429
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,604
Hey, Moon!!

430
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,316
Hey! Moon, ah, Moon, Moon.

431
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:23,331
Moon, don't do this.

432
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,594
You...

433
00:59:43,296 --> 00:59:47,027
Was the hole too shallow?

434
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:50,702
Congratulations, anyway.
You survived.
