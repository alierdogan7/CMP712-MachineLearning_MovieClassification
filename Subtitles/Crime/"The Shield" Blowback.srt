00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,080
<i>“Previously on” The Shield:</i>

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,840
–I said, I'm a cop!
–And I'm a cop killer.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,520
–Do you trust me?
–Yeah.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,040
Well, then you believe
me when I tell you…

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,680
you don't have to look over
your shoulder no more.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,720
I took care of it.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,720
–I'm concerned about Matthew.
–Well, he's a little shy, but…

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,920
What I'm trying to say is,
I think there's a problem.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,360
What kind of problem?

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,480
Something a developmental
paediatrician should diagnose.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,906
A neurologist, maybe.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,400
–I'm not gay.
–I wasn't gay either…

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,600
until the day I just
admitted that I was.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,720
It's okay. It's okay.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,000
Say it.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,800
We killed a cop.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,680
Lem and Ronnie failed
to clear the room.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,680
Two-Time killed Terry. Get over it.
Don't bring it up again.

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,666
Is there anything
you're not allergic to?

20
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,000
Sheet metal.

21
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,800
This coke's really pink?

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,880
No, not really. It just looks pink
in the right kind of light.

23
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,640
–Cool.
–Yeah. It's Peruvian.

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,600
Rondell said the street ain't seen blow
this strong since Grandmaster Flash.

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,280
What's that?

26
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Never mind.

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,000
How much time are they giving these
days for installing an illegal wiretap?

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,240
Not as long as some of
this fruit's been here.

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,448
These Third World cavemen
ever hear of a Ralphs?

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,000
–Shane. Shane, Shane, Shane.
–Here we go.

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,240
–Yo.
–Yeah. Bakers are home, boys…

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,976
and they're coming through
the front door. Exit the ass.

33
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,480
This is gonna be a sweet
win for us, boys.

34
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,240
Aceveda gets a gold star,
we get a little breathing room.

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
–Rondell gets product.
–The retirement fund keeps growing.

36
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,360
–Who's saving for retirement?
–Can you say “ski-doo”?

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,840
All right.
Hey, we're wired.

38
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,760
The Armenians speak Armenian.

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,520
–Theo Chorlian?
–Yeah?

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,040
Professor Gaffney says
you'd be the perfect guy…

41
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,160
to help us with
a special investigation.

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,840
–What kind of special…?
–You'll love it. Come with us.

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,160
He'll meet you back
at the dorm. All right?

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,800
These guys are
Eastern Armenian.

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,480
–So?
–So they got accents.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,492
You understand what
they're saying or not?

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,040
The gardener delivers six loaves
of Agien white bread?

48
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,800
–Does that make sense?
–When and where?

49
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,440
Will arrive here
tomorrow night, 9:30.

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,560
–At the bakery.
–Bakery? What kind of bread this is?

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,560
–Thanks, kid.
–What's this all about?

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,240
–Who are these guys?
–National security.

53
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,960
Don't tell a goddamn soul.

54
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,640
You've been a big help.
Thanks.

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,320
Okay, Bingham,
here's the story.

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,120
You were driving these gothic
goons back from LAX…

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,320
when you overheard them talking
about the shipment of cocaine.

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,280
I won't bore you with the details.
Being such a concerned citizen…

59
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,676
you felt compelled to share
this information with the authorities.

60
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,060
All we need now is for you
to sign your statement.

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Here you go.

62
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,762
Anything to take
a bite out of crime.

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
Judge Weiss is waiting.

64
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,160
Well, thank you for helping us
get our nice legal warrant.

65
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,994
–Feels good to do the right thing.
–Yes, it does.

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,160
–Showtime?
–There's seats still available.

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,640
I saw the warrant,
heard you were rolling out.

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,716
I'm backing you up
with a few uniform patrols.

69
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
That's not how we do it.

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,924
Well, that's how I do it. I wanna make
sure everyone comes home this time.

71
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,440
The more the merrier.

72
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,760
Good.

73
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,520
–Somebody here to see me?
–Over there.

74
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,520
–What are you doing here?
–Well, I'm here to report a hit and run.

75
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,960
–What?
–I was struck by…

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,080
a beautiful black man
driving a big red…

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,800
–Not here. You have got to go.
–Look, you haven't called.

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,720
–I just wanna make sure you're okay.
–I'm fine, now go.

79
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,080
Why are you
shutting me out then?

80
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,840
I'll call you later.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,432
I don't wanna just hear your voice.
I wanna see you.

82
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,640
I'll stop by if you leave right now.

83
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,080
Okay.

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,120
But if you don't show,
I'm gonna be back here tomorrow…

85
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,600
and the day after,
and the day after that.

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,560
–Danny.
–Hey, Dutch.

87
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,880
Here are those notes and study
guides for the sergeant's exam.

88
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Great.

89
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,360
The test is at 7 a.m in San Pedro.
What's up with that?

90
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,314
Lack of sleep thins the herd.

91
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,886
I barely know my name before 8.

92
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Got lesson plans, practice tests.
I organized it all.

93
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,240
Should make it easier
for us to review it.

94
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,960
–Thanks. This is a big help.
–When do you wanna go over that?

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,320
–Tomorrow night good?
–Good for me.

96
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,440
–9:00, my place?
–Your place, perfect. No distractions.

97
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,560
A study date? What kind of
backdoor con is that?

98
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,640
I'm helping her study
for the sergeant's exam.

99
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,440
Unless the first question is,
“Will you sleep with me?”…

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,800
you're wasting your time.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,200
Okay. Hang back.
Once we're inside…

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,880
cover the exits.
I'll call you out.

103
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,760
Police, freeze!
Put that gun down!

104
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,800
Get it down!
Put the gun down!

105
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,240
Put your hands in the air!
Put them on your head!

106
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,052
On your head!
Put your hands on your head!

107
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,656
All right, we're clear.
We're clear.

108
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,360
–He's done. Cuff him.
–Ronnie.

109
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,920
–All right, call them up.
–“We're secure.

110
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,400
“One dead Armenian,”
“three” to take home.

111
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,680
–Copy that. Code Four. Code Four.
–We're Code Four.

112
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,440
King, call for a body wagon.

113
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,840
–Cover that door.
–I'm there.

114
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,000
–Cover the back.
–Okay.

115
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,880
No one in or out not wearing a badge.
Mike, come with me.

116
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,280
–That don't look pink.
–It's not the right kind of light.

117
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,036
Get this stuff downstairs.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,200
–Load them up.
–Thank you, sir.

119
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,700
Easy with that. Don't spill it
all over the place.

120
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,520
Hey. Jesus Christ here was
the shooter. Keep him separate.

121
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,480
Gotcha.
Come on.

122
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,800
Okay, Ronnie,
you got the ball.

123
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
You know how much fat
is in that cookie?

124
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,480
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

125
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,536
No, I'm serious.

126
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,778
Those are sugarcoated lard balls.

127
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,510
–Have you looked at your waist lately?
–Come on, Shane.

128
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
Get to it.

129
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,080
–Bag it.
–Bag it.

130
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
–Bag it.
–Bag it.

131
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,360
And…

132
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,640
bag it.

133
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,440
Don't want my kids to end up
in U.C Northridge hell.

134
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,600
–Hey, I went to Northridge.
–Majored in “Where's the Keg At”?

135
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,808
–That's funny.
–Deliver this package to Rondell.

136
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,680
Right.

137
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,800
Hey, nice job, guys.

138
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,280
Way to go, guys.

139
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,000
Four bricks of Peruvian pink, people.

140
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,680
Hey, angel.

141
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,800
–What?
–You're five hours late.

142
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,760
–It's work.
–Yeah, well, I have to go to work too…

143
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,200
in about five hours.
–Hey.

144
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,560
What? We just took down
some bad guys.

145
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,120
–I'm feeling it.
–Well, it doesn't mean I have to.

146
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,840
–Just give me 15 minutes.
–A marathon.

147
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,600
–15 minutes. 15 minutes.
–All right.

148
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,640
–Four keys. Nice bust.
–Yes. Very nice.

149
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,520
–Don't see any money in the log.
–That's because there wasn't any.

150
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,560
–Major drug deal and no cash?
–Nope.

151
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,240
Just a million in powder,
a killer and two drug collars.

152
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,760
Sorry. Slow night.

153
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,120
I guess if that's what you put
in the book, then that's what you found.

154
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,470
Look, it was a delivery, not a buy.

155
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Why is it that no matter what I do,
you always assume the worst?

156
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,822
Have you given me a choice?

157
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,120
Believe it or not,
we want the same things:

158
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,600
taxpayers safe,
bad guys behind bars.

159
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,522
I just wanna make sure
we're going about it the same way.

160
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,400
I know you blame me for Terry's death.
It was my command.

161
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,320
–I deserve that.
–Yeah, you do.

162
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,000
But what happened that night…

163
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,600
if I could change it, I would.

164
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
I can't.

165
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,600
Neither can you.

166
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
You gotta be shitting me.

167
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,080
You're a cop.
Why couldn't you call it in?

168
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,640
–It's complicated. Police issues.
–What's that mean?

169
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,960
You have no idea how bad
I need for you to be quiet right now.

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,360
–We've been down this block 3 times.
–Unless you see a black Navigator…

171
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,634
there should be nothing
coming out of your mouth.

172
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
–Black Navigator…
–Not funny!

173
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,240
–No, a black Navigator.
–It's not funny!

174
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,600
Hey.

175
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,160
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, pull over!

176
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,800
Pull… I'm a cop!
I'm a police officer!

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,520
Pull…
I swear to God.

178
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,196
–Pull over! Hey! Pull over! Pull over!
–Shane.

179
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,920
–Pull over right now! Goddamn it!
–Oh, my God.

180
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,680
–Pull your car over!
–Shane.

181
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,760
Pull over! Right there!
Pull over! Yeah!

182
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,440
Stay there. Right there.
You, come here!

183
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,400
You understand English?
Come here.

184
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,360
–Right now.
–Take the truck, man! Just take it!

185
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,520
–Don't shoot us, dude.
–Shut up. I'm a cop.

186
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,520
What'd we do?

187
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,640
You stole a police vehicle,
you little shitheads.

188
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,520
It's my mom's car.

189
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,360
Tampons.
No.

190
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,680
What? What?

191
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,800
–Let me do that.
–I got it.

192
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,600
–You make it too strong.
–Okay.

193
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,896
You're up early.

194
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,560
Thought I heard Matthew
having a nightmare last night.

195
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,320
–Did you hear Cassidy coughing?
–No.

196
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,840
I think she's getting
what the baby had.

197
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,240
–The doctor's at 3:30.
–I know.

198
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,080
–Hey.
–Hey.

199
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,160
–Good morning, Corrine.
–Morning.

200
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,160
–What are you doing here?
–I kind of lost the truck last night.

201
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,160
You know,
the one with the stuff inside.

202
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,920
What?

203
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,700
I'm gonna go check on Cassidy.

204
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,360
–You lost the Navigator?
–Somebody stole it.

205
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,120
–With the drugs inside.
–Yeah.

206
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,480
–Where were you?
–At Amy's.

207
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,520
You stopped to get laid?
What the hell were you thinking?

208
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,804
I was thinking about getting laid.

209
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,240
–I'm sorry.
–Sorry doesn't cut it.

210
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,600
I was wrong.

211
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,200
–So, what do you wanna do now?
–We got about four more hours…

212
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,240
before that truck is
on the way to Mexico City…

213
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,108
in about 10·000 pieces,
and our score's out on the street.

214
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,480
Call Lem and Ronnie,
get them to the clubhouse.

215
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,680
Nobody steals from us.

216
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,680
That quick, it had to be a pro.

217
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
–It's being chopped as we speak.
–So they have the drugs.

218
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,240
–And I'm out 50 K.
–We're all out 50 K.

219
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,284
–Maybe they're just letting it cool off.
–You hold onto that little dream.

220
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Go to Rondell.
Tell him what happened.

221
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,400
–Tell him what happened?
–He'll hear about it anyway.

222
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,486
–All right.
–You, come with me.

223
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,440
I can't wait to tell Rondell.

224
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,000
Vic, my man.

225
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,600
–Officer Hoffman.
–Vic.

226
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,874
–Hollywood.
–What's up, Hoff.

227
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,400
–What you got yourself?
–Green Jeep.

228
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,124
Had a couple nibbles, no bites.
What can I do you for?

229
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,160
–Who's chopping the big trucks?
–What kind?

230
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,388
–Navigator.
–Year?

231
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,720
–Brand new.
–2002 Lincoln Navigator.

232
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,280
A few places offhand. Currently the
demand is greater than the supply.

233
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,000
–Where's demand the greatest?
–Hold on, hold on.

234
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,480
Slow day.

235
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,480
Look, main shop is in your part of town
where they chops those monsters.

236
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,160
Skinny Polish prick. Mark Wojo…
Wojohowitz or something like that.

237
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,440
–Don't tell him I sent you.
–Thanks, man. I owe you.

238
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,520
If you need another guy
on your team, man…

239
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,880
maybe you'll toss my name
in the hat. I could use the action.

240
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,884
Who knows? Might be a new spot
opening up any day now.

241
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,680
Well, all right.

242
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,520
So many rocks, so little time.

243
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,720
Nothing like the bust
last night, though, huh?

244
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,014
That was a big one.

245
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,632
–What was the final score on that one?
–Four bricks.

246
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,520
Four?

247
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,560
Mackey sure knows how
to pull them out of his ass.

248
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,514
You might as well talk to us.

249
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,760
We've got four cops who saw you
blow your buddy's brains out.

250
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,160
You know what that means?

251
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,360
One of them could
get hit by a bus and we'd…

252
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,240
Still have three cops who could
put you away for first-degree murder.

253
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,120
You listening to me?
Add that to the trafficking…

254
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,054
Charge and, well, your prospects
aren't looking too pretty.

255
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,320
“Tell me where you”
“got the drugs.”

256
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,600
“Tell me about your buddy Margos,”
“and his drug connections.”

257
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,040
“–You listening to me?”
“–I say something funny?”

258
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,898
“What if I stuffed big blue bananas”
“in your ears and set them on fire?”

259
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,180
“Any of this getting through?”

260
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,080
This guy ignores me almost as much
as my kids did in high school.

261
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,680
–Nothing?
–No one's talking.

262
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,160
–They're all terrified of him.
–Anything on the prints?

263
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,160
Only Dizarian's came up on Interpol.
Lokely's got a Glendale address.

264
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,640
He's been questioned,
but not charged in…

265
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,440
Kosovo, Bogotα, Sri Lanka.
–Frequent flier.

266
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,040
He just came back from a 36-hour
holiday from Chiclayo, Peru.

267
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Harvest-time.

268
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,372
–Get a warrant to search his place.
–Yeah.

269
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,840
“Revenge? Crime of passion?”

270
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,240
He insult your mother?
Having a bad hair day?

271
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,640
Let me know if I'm getting warm.

272
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,240
–Yeah.
–This Universal Studios?

273
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,760
–What? No.
–What, you mean this ain't City Walk?

274
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,120
–Are you guys for real?
–Looky here.

275
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,200
Looks like a vehicle being
stripped for illegal distribution.

276
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,160
I'll be damned.
In plain sight too.

277
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,720
–It's a good thing we're policemen.
–No way.

278
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,920
Think that Universal thing's
gonna hold up in court?

279
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,240
Well, maybe, maybe not.
In the meantime, it looks like…

280
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,640
we'll have to return these
to their owners…

281
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,056
and bring you in,
Polish prick Mark.

282
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,840
–All right, what do you guys want?
–Blue Navigator.

283
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,048
–Don't have one.
–You get any offers last night?

284
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,200
Answer the question.

285
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,264
–I get to keep these?
–If you make me happy.

286
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,166
A guy Ricardo called.
Wanted to unload a Navigator.

287
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,000
–Ricardo have an address?
–Yeah. He's in Silver Lake.

288
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,280
Where in Silver Lake, asshole?

289
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,792
Must like you, officer. It's the first
thing this faggot's said all day.

290
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,800
–Hey, Dutch.
–Hey.

291
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,800
You interviewed that Armenian, right?

292
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,640
“Interview” would imply that
a conversation took place.

293
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,280
–This guy didn't say a word.
–He did to me.

294
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,760
–When?
–Just now.

295
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,080
–What'd he say?
–I guess it was Armenian.

296
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
It sounded something
like “Hamal Votcar.”

297
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,280
<i>–Hamal Votcar.
–Hamal Votcar.</i>

298
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,320
–You okay?
–Yeah. That guy just creeps me out.

299
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,000
Don't let him.
He's behind bars.

300
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,954
–I'll check on this.
–Thanks.

301
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,840
What the hell?

302
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,000
–Who are you guys?
–Shut up.

303
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,640
I'm trying to sleep here.

304
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,280
Where's the Navigator
you tried to unload last night?

305
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,240
How'd you get in my bedroom?

306
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,200
Look, I didn't Jack it.
It was Dina.

307
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,080
–Who's Dina?
–Girl I'm trying to break into the game.

308
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,200
He's trying to bone.

309
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,320
–Where can we find Dina?
–Who are you guys?

310
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,400
Hey, call Lem and Ronnie and
have them bring you over to Dina's.

311
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,200
–Where are you going?
–I got somewhere to go.

312
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,760
–Where?
–You're not exactly…

313
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,240
in a position to question
my decisions.

314
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,250
Just call me when you
have Dina or the drugs.

315
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,760
–Officer Sofer.
–Detective Mackey.

316
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,640
–What you got there?
–Notes.

317
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,520
Sergeant's exam.
Dutch is gonna help me out.

318
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,600
Dutchman isn't pulling the old
I'll-help-you-study…

319
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,148
you-help-me-get-laid
manoeuvre, is he?

320
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,714
–He'd like to help me pass.
–He'd like to help you out of your pants.

321
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,240
Last night, Shane ran in
for a Slurpee and managed…

322
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,480
to get our police-issue
vehicle jacked.

323
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,640
–Ouch.
–Yeah. Had our weapons in it too.

324
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,800
That stuff hits the street and gets
traced back to us…

325
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,480
Aceveda will put Shane's balls
in a vice. And mine too, probably.

326
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,440
–What's the vehicle?
–2002 blue Navigator, fully loaded.

327
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,320
I'd like to bring it in
personally, quietly.

328
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,960
Keep my eye open
and give you the heads up.

329
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,600
Thanks.

330
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,960
So is that what Shane's calling it
these days, a Slurpee?

331
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,320
I guess so.

332
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,600
Detective Wyms, I was hoping
I could talk to you.

333
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
–About?
–Advice.

334
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,200
Well, shouldn't you be going
to your P-3 for advice?

335
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,440
I'd rather talk to you.

336
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,000
–Why? Because I'm black?
–No.

337
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,460
Better not be because
I remind you of your mother.

338
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,000
No, ma'am.

339
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,440
I mean, detective.

340
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,200
Never mind. I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

341
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,160
Officer.

342
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,160
What is it?

343
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,960
I think I may have seen another cop
do something illegal on the job.

344
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,904
–And?
–And I don't know what to do about it.

345
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:57,160
You're talking about jeopardizing
two careers here: his and yours.

346
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Mine?

347
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,160
Nobody likes a rat, especially one
who hasn't proven himself.

348
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,720
–So I should keep this to myself.
–No, I didn't say that.

349
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,200
You gotta ask yourself if it's something
bad enough to risk that kind of heat.

350
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,200
Is it something you can't
live with holding?

351
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,080
You're certain there
were six bricks?

352
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,720
Six or seven.
Definitely more than four.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
–You did the right thing.
–Yeah.

354
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,920
–I know it wasn't easy.
–No, sir.

355
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,700
We'd be a lot better off with more
men like you and fewer like Mackey.

356
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,920
So, what happens now?

357
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,680
Can you check on when
the blue Navigator was checked in?

358
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
Don't have to. Wasn't.

359
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,994
Supposed to be in five hours ago.
Wilshire's been asking for it back.

360
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,680
–He's supposed to be the best.
–They say that about every doctor.

361
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,280
–Yeah.
–“Is Shane with you?”

362
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
No. Why?

363
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,920
<i>Just got a complaint from a woman
“who said a police officer…”</i>

364
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,200
fitting Shane's description,
assaulted her son at gunpoint…

365
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,000
claiming he stole
a police vehicle.

366
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,160
You sure she's not
some crackpot?

367
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,720
“Where's that blue Navigator”
“you signed out last night?”

368
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,120
Don't know.
I'll ask Shane when I see him.

369
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,988
–“I need that truck back now”.
–Loud and clear. Gotta run.

370
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,360
–Sorry.
–Quite all right.

371
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,446
Why don't you both have a seat.

372
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,120
So, Mr And Mrs Mackey,
how are you both doing today?

373
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,404
You tell us.
How'd the testing go?

374
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,320
The past three sessions have
gone well. You're very lucky.

375
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,520
Matthew is a charming,
intelligent little boy.

376
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,440
He also has autism.

377
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,880
–What?
–Autism.

378
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,240
–Oh, God.
–Wait a minute.

379
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,880
He's a little shy, behind a bit…

380
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,240
but autism? Jesus.

381
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,840
What does that mean?

382
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,000
It's a hard word to hear, but it's also
a very misunderstood word.

383
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,840
–Matthew's a beautiful child. He's…
–I know my son is beautiful.

384
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,718
–I understand what you're feeling.
–Really.

385
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,760
I have two autistic boys of my own.

386
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,520
–Two?
–Oh, man.

387
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,640
Yes. I felt everything
you're feeling twice.

388
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,360
What's gonna happen to him?

389
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,120
–He's going to grow up.
–What about school?

390
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,200
He may be best served
in a special program.

391
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,440
Special? What do you mean, like
blue-bus special? That's not my kid.

392
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,320
I mean, look at him.
He's just Matt.

393
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,240
I knew something was wrong.

394
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,600
He could stay in his present
school with some speech therapy…

395
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,760
and special-skills instruction.
–Is he gonna be normal or not?

396
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,840
With the proper support, he will be able
to make gains to the best of his ability.

397
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,600
And with intervention,
the prognosis is very good.

398
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,360
He's just gonna need a lot of love
and work to get there.

399
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,842
He's got the love.
What kind of work?

400
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,440
Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm a cop.

401
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,698
–What?
“–We are so screwed, man.”

402
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,522
“Aceveda just put a statewide
“APB out on the Navigator.”

403
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,760
What's up?

404
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,400
Roommate said this Dina girl went to
go get waxed. She didn't know where.

405
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,080
–You got anything more vague?
–What should we do?

406
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,720
Aceveda gets ahold of this truck, he's
gonna do a chem match on the blow…

407
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
our fingerprints
are all over the bricks.

408
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,960
We'll all crash and burn
because of you!

409
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,560
Christ, Amy's not even that hot.

410
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,840
–Come on, Lem.
–No, bull!

411
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,280
He's right.
You boned us.

412
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,280
Oh, thank you for the support, assholes!

413
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,000
Cut it out!

414
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,066
We're not going down.

415
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,440
–You understand me?
–Yeah, yeah.

416
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,680
All right. Ronnie, you stay here
and wait for Dina.

417
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,760
Lem, they got a bunch of those
wax places over on Olvera Street.

418
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,760
We'll check the muff rippers
over in Little Tokyo. Let's go.

419
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,800
Well, if the DA is not gonna file…

420
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,160
–You check out Margos' place?
–Yeah.

421
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,600
You think this guy was spooky before,
you should see the way he lives.

422
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,760
–What'd you find?
–Nothing incriminating.

423
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,840
Just a couple hundred maps,
six dictionaries in five languages.

424
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,800
–Scanner, digital camera, GameBoy.
–Incense, meditation books.

425
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,400
–Disposable diapers.
–A whole case of microwave popcorn.

426
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,520
–Hey, no microwave.
–No microwave.

427
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,560
–No fridge, no stove.
–No plates, silverware.

428
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,200
–No soap.
–No toilet paper.

429
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,720
No more.

430
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,322
This guy just gets better and better.

431
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,040
–Break almost over?
–Yeah.

432
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,360
Did you get a chance
to look at those notes?

433
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,520
A little.

434
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,200
A lot of stuff to absorb.
Don't put it off too long.

435
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,720
I won't.

436
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,718
Hey, Dutch, any luck
with that translation?

437
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,960
You know, it's a phonetic spelling.

438
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,800
Armenians have this
Eastern-Western dialect thing.

439
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,200
–What did your guy say that it meant?
–This is by no means definitive.

440
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,040
But what Margos may have
been saying was…

441
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,400
delicious feet.
–Excuse me?

442
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,640
–Delicious feet, yeah.
–Oh, God.

443
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,084
You probably just
heard him wrong.

444
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
Hey, hey.

445
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,040
Let's go.

446
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
Don't move.

447
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,240
Jesus.

448
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,520
He snapped his neck.

449
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,960
Let me guess. You're not talking.
Get them out of here.

450
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,280
And call Central, have them
get this guy out of my building.

451
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,640
Step outside the car by opening
the door from the outside.

452
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,120
Okay.

453
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,920
–Sorry.
–Step outside.

454
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,800
–I'm so sorry.
–Turn around.

455
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,880
–Put your hands on the window.
–Look, I…

456
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,000
I know it's not your problem, okay…

457
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,000
but I'm sorry.
My dad's drinking again…

458
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,400
and I had to grab my brother
and bolt out of there this morning.

459
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,360
It was so crazy.
God, I was so scared.

460
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,160
Well, sorry. Listen, is there anything
we can do for you?

461
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,920
Yeah. I just need to pick up my brother
at school before my dad gets there.

462
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,080
I mean, God knows
what he'll do to him.

463
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,560
If you could just let me go…

464
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,418
Always pick up your abused brother
in a stolen vehicle with bogus plates?

465
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,280
Damn.

466
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,318
–One Tango 13, copy?
–Hey, hold up on that.

467
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,880
Stand by.
What?

468
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,000
Told Vic I'd give him the heads up
when we found the Navigator.

469
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,560
–What for?
–I don't know.

470
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,240
–He wants to be the one to bring it in.
–It's an APB. We have to call it in.

471
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,040
Look, I owe Vic one. Hey!

472
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,840
Where are you going?

473
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,920
You two look like you
needed some alone time.

474
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,800
Get in the car.

475
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,920
One Tango 13, we have a confirmation
on that stolen Navigator.

476
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,458
“Roger, Tango 13.”
“I'll notify the watch commander.”

477
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,626
I can't risk a bad mark on my jacket
this early in my career.

478
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,522
Anything touched?

479
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,880
No, sir, we secured the scene
and made the call.

480
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,240
Okay.

481
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,520
Lock box.

482
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,520
Nothing.

483
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,360
Goddamn it.

484
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,600
He called it in before
I could stop him.

485
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,600
–Are you kidding me?
–What's his problem?

486
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,290
Look, he's just learning.

487
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,120
Look, the good news is
they didn't find those weapons.

488
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,600
–Did he find anything?
–Just Dina.

489
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,920
Looks like I located
your missing truck.

490
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,336
Was hoping I'd save you the trouble.

491
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,680
–All's well that ends well.
–Yeah.

492
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,080
–You're in deep, Dina.
–Yeah?

493
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,720
Shoplifting, assault.
Now grand-theft auto.

494
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,760
–What's next?
–Thinking about the police academy.

495
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,040
Why don't you go
get me an application.

496
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,560
You think this is a game, little girl?
This is real time in real prison.

497
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,200
Okay. Are you going somewhere
with this scared-straight angle?

498
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,992
Or is this where I tell you how my
daddy used to crawl into bed with me?

499
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,560
I wanna know what
you found in the Navigator.

500
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,950
I heard someone call you “captain.”

501
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,840
I mean, isn't a stolen car case
normally a little below your radar?

502
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,160
You wouldn't be here…

503
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,830
if I didn't have what you wanted.
–Where are the drugs?

504
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,040
They're safe.

505
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,094
Tell me where, and I'll make sure
the auto theft goes away.

506
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,600
Until I see it, I don't say it.
In writing, signed by the DA.

507
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,400
–Hey. That the car thief stuff?
–Yeah.

508
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,596
Hey, I hear you're
looking for another stripe.

509
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,320
–Yeah. See you.
–All right. Good luck.

510
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,680
Thanks.

511
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,160
She made three phone calls
after she stole the truck.

512
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,292
Two to her roommates and the other
to a pawnshop in Echo Park.

513
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,840
“–Pemble & Pemble on Esther.”
–Head for Esther in Echo Park.

514
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
–Man, do I owe you one.
–Please. At best, I'm even.

515
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,800
Stop staring at my feet,
you Balkan freak.

516
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,120
–“What”?
–Nothing.

517
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,240
Danny.
Come with us.

518
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,720
I think Aceveda got Dina to talk.
I gotta go.

519
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,320
–Damn it.
–What?

520
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,806
Hey, man, we're not closed yet.

521
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,288
Yo, “sprechen sie Englisch”, skinhead?
I said, we're not closed yet.

522
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,680
In 30 seconds I'll either know
what I wanna know or you'll be dead.

523
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,568
–Dina.
–I don't know a Dina.

524
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,080
–How come you have our guns here?
–Talk!

525
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,080
–Dina called for Freddy.
–Who's Freddy?

526
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,880
French guy.
Helps me out with the night traffic.

527
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,760
–Where are the drugs?
–I don't know. Maybe Freddy took them.

528
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,960
Not good enough!

529
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,160
I swear to God, man, I don't know!

530
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,400
Why would I cover for him?
Jesus Christ, he's French.

531
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,240
Where can we find the frog?

532
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,120
Looks like Freddy
couldn't hold his sugar.

533
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,040
Power of the pink.

534
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,200
–Blew a goddamn vessel.
–Oh, that's nasty.

535
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,310
All right, go through this place. Make
sure there's nothing here to tie us.

536
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,200
Vic! It's Aceveda.

537
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,094
Hey, let's clean up Freddy! Here we go.

538
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,520
–Oh, shit. Clean him up.
–Wipe it all down.

539
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,310
Tray. Here's the tray.
Here's the tray. Coming through.

540
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,880
Yeah, yeah. Is that it?

541
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,798
All right, all right.
Run this. Good, good.

542
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,880
–You got it?
–Clean fingers.

543
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,600
–What's going on here?
–It must've been a hell of a party.

544
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,960
–What happened to him?
–Looks like an O.D. Found him that way.

545
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,760
–Been dead a while. Really dead.
–Yeah. We were about to call it in.

546
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,680
You were about to call it in.
What are you doing here?

547
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,920
Fair question. Tracking down the guns
from our stolen ride.

548
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,228
–Yep. All's here and accounted for, sir.
–Can't have them hitting the streets.

549
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,920
–Didn't want them in the wrong hands.
–Where's Mackey?

550
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,360
Hey. Thought he wouldn't mind
if I used the can.

551
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,204
What are you doing there, captain?

552
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,720
I'm looking for something.

553
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,880
–Where is it?
–Don't know what you're talking about.

554
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,616
Hey, treat yourself to a full
cavity search if you like.

555
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
I'll see you back at the barn.

556
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,120
Turn it inside out.

557
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,560
Every inch.

558
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,272
–I thought you were working.
–Yeah. I gotta go back.

559
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,080
Just snuck out
to tuck in little man.

560
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,040
Better hurry.
He might already be asleep.

561
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,280
Okay.

562
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,560
–How you doing?
–I'm all right. I'm just a little tired.

563
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,680
Yeah. I know.
Don't worry, we'll get through this.

564
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,560
What did you get for 38?

565
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,280
I answered C.

566
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,760
No, it's B.

567
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,120
Have to report the infraction
immediately to the commanding officer.

568
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,998
–There's no latitude on that.
–Stupid rule.

569
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,000
Would you turn in your partner
on something like that?

570
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,120
I know how I'd answer on the test.

571
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,680
Hello? Hi.

572
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,962
No, are you okay?

573
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,800
No, come on over. Okay.

574
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,720
–Everything all right?
–Yeah.

575
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,120
A friend of mine is having a crisis
and she wants to come over.

576
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,120
–She okay?
–I don't know.

577
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,320
–We got a lot of work done tonight.
–Yeah.

578
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,320
Hey, you're a good teacher.

579
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,360
–See you tomorrow?
–Yeah.

580
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,200
We'll dive into administrative
and procedural.

581
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,000
It's dry stuff, but you can't pass
without nailing it.

582
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,022
–Good night.
–Night. I hope your friend's okay.

583
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,280
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

584
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,800
Okay.

585
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,240
Thanks.

586
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:51,080
Sorry about today, it was such a faggot
thing to do. Showing up at your work.

587
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,640
Don't do it again.

588
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,120
I won't.

589
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,440
You gonna sit?

590
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,800
I really am sorry.

591
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,560
I'll make it up to you.

592
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,286
I can't be the person that you want me
to be. I shouldn't even be here.

593
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,680
–You've never come back, have you?
–This is stupid.

594
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,400
What's stupid are the late-night cruises
and anonymous hummers in your car.

595
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,200
What?

596
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,800
I read a page of your diary?

597
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,000
You don't know anything about me.
Things that I believe, things that I see.

598
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,600
–You're a good person.
–I'm doing a bad thing.

599
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,360
You deserve to be happy.

600
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,200
You ever read the Bible?

601
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,920
Scripture teaches…

602
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,280
Never mind.

603
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,080
You came back.

604
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,600
Start listening to yourself.

605
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,080
–You're here late.
–I'm e-mailing my girls.

606
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,154
Just got a call from Central.

607
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,760
Margos Dizarian
escaped from the paddy wagon.

608
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
What? How?

609
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,700
Jimmied open the back door, dove out
at 40 miles an hour in his cuffs.

610
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,640
–Disappeared down an alley.
–Jesus.

611
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,160
–I know.
–That's a special kind of crazy.

612
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,920
Very special.
Just thought you should know.

613
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,880
I wish I didn't.
God knows where he is right now.

614
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,080
You okay?

615
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,080
Not really.

616
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,560
I'm just kind of all over the place.

617
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,000
–Job?
–Yeah. And I…

618
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,440
Brutal day.

619
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,920
“Come on”.

620
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,600
Where are you?

621
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,440
I don't know.

622
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,440
I got something going on with my kid.

623
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,880
You don't wanna hear it.

624
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,000
Let's talk about something else.

625
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Yeah.

626
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,240
Oh, you've gotta be shitting me.
