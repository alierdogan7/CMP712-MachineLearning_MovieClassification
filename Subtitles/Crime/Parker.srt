-Excuse me if I'm late.

00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,920
Here's my bank.

7
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:09,282
Like, 20 minutes.

8
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:41,905
Wearing another Fred & Ginger,

00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:44,520

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,116

People in the county
of Cincinnati in Audrey's performances

12
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:54,805
for 16 years in fame.
Don't worry dance fans.

13
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,068
-C'mon mommy!
-One more time ma'am.

14
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,335
There you go.
It's all yours.

15
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:35,104
-C'mon mommy try again!
-Ok.

16
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:43,130
Fake some pain in your heart.

17
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,866
-C'mon!
-All right, try again. One more time.
-No.

18
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:33,047
-C'mon, c'mon one more time!
-C'mon mommy, please.

19
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:35,739
-Hey, padre.
-No.
-I really want it.

20
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,292
-Come on in here,
help this little girl out here.
-No.

21
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:41,188
-I don't think so.
-No, cash, no nots, on the house.

22
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:44,699
C'mon for this little
beautiful little girl, you could do it.
-Please.

23
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,557
C'mon on the house, 5 3 4.
There you go.

24
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:51,499
-Who wants to be next here?
-Cool, yeah!

25
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,555
-Look mommy, I won, I won!
-We have a winner!

26
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:56,950
-Well done to the winner!
-I won, thank you!

27
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:11,493
Here, it's for you.
You're a winner.

28
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:13,372
-You're a winner.
-Thank you.

29
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:16,644
-Thank you, padre.
-There's a big winner.

30
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:29,141
Hardwick!
Hey!

31
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:52,161
Got it.
Be very quiet.

32
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:07,490
Hey officer,
I've got to get through real quick.

33
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,593
Sorry sir.
Livestock shows are changing.

34
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:10,949
You're gonna have
to wait 20 minutes.

35
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,430
C'mon I'm not gonna
say anything if you don't say anything.

36
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:14,642
No Sir,
those are the rules.

37
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:16,954
Easy.

38
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:24,628
Hardwick's torching the
hay bales in 5 minutes.

39
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,106
Wait for my call.

40
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,960
-$ 20 bands please.
-Let's move this in cos we've got another equipment comin'in.

41
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:33,358
It's gonna be over 100
degrees again today.

42
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:36,635
Frankie, grab me a
lemon shake from the restaurant?

43
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,590
This is gonna be fun.
My uncle was a priest.

44
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:57,479
Sorry to bother you.
I'm on a bus back to Cleveland at 4.

45
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,906
I was wondering if there's some
place I could put this when I walk around.

46
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:03,064
Sure Father.
Right where you came in,

47
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:05,636
there's a blue building.
It's the hospitality center.

48
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:09,499
They'll be more than happy to help
you with whatever you need. They got some
very good refreshments there.

49
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,088
- Go, go.
- Freeze!

50
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:17,505
Drop it!

51
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:19,862
Let's go.

52
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:25,647
Everybody down!
Down in front of the table!

53
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:28,589
Put your fucking face down!
Hold it!

54
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,153
-What is the erase code?
- 487.

55
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:33,857
Type it in.

56
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,083
Let's go.
Move!

57
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,015
On the floor.
Face down.

58
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,399
Need all your phones
on a pile over here please.

59
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,776
Right up here,
like the good Father said.

60
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,909
Hurry, up here!

61
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,683
We want this over
as quickly as possible

62
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:08,263
You wanna steal from
people who can't afford it?

63
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,049
You don't have
people that don't deserve it.

64
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,616
So relax.

65
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:16,690
I'm no better than you.
You're no better than me.

66
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,588
If I say I'll do
something I'll do it.

67
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,464
You say you'll
do something if you don't

68
00:08:22,497 --> 00:08:24,136
I'll make sure
you regret it.

69
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,449
We don't have
the key today for the cabinet.

70
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,999
-Only Mr. Lindsey has those keys.
-Shut it old man.

71
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,949
Hands behind your back.
Everyone, hands behind your back!

72
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:57,279
-Stay down bitch!
-Back down sailor.

73
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,245
I can't always breathe.

74
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:02,977
Please, I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!

75
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:05,583
Shut your guts
or I'll blow your head off!

76
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,245
Hey, I'll take care of this.

77
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,373
Tie them up.
Calm down.

78
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,477
Take it easy.

79
00:09:18,576 --> 00:09:21,237
Take it easy.
It's ok.

80
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:23,925
It's gonna be just fine.

81
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,886
I promise.

82
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,837
-What's your name?
-Ben.

83
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,736
Do you have a girlfriend, Ben?

84
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,208
She loves you, right?

85
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:40,904
What's her name?

86
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:43,880
Hannah.

87
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,112
Tonight you're gonna be
sitting with your arm around Hannah.

88
00:09:47,113 --> 00:09:49,221
Watching this
on the 10 o'clock news.

89
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,865
She'll be so close you'll
feel her breath on your neck.

90
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:56,582
When she hears how
nobody got hurt toady because you're a cool head,

91
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,771
she's gonna press a
warm hand against your cheek.

92
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,715
She's gonna look
into your eyes,

93
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:08,200
like there's no place
else she ever wants to look again.

94
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,125
Trust me Ben,
it's gonna be a good night.

95
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,774
Thank..
Thank you Father.

96
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:17,122
On the floor.

97
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:20,294
Hands behind your back.

98
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,858
Ok, let's get in.

99
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:34,706
Partner, you is better be
right about what's inside these tin cans.

100
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,759
Hurry up
before he drinks it all.

101
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,764
You're right,
we should have left earlier.

102
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,799
Hey, you
look beautiful, Claire.

103
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,219
I bet you say
that to all the girls.

104
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,483
-You know you're the only one.
-What about your partner?

105
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,363
-C'mon your dad's important to me.
-I know it.

106
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,533
I love that
you love him.

107
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:01,016
-Hurley!
-Hey, dad!

108
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:05,091
-Excuse me a second.
-Sure.

109
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:06,945
There's my little girl.

110
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:09,468
Claire, who's
this bum you brought?

111
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,529
-Hi beautiful.
-Hi, daddy.

112
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,820
-I'm gonna find Jen.
-Good, go see her.

113
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,032
So good to see you man.

114
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,469
Me too, Hurley.

115
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:23,069
Ok.
One down, one to go.

116
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,098
-How does it look?
-What have we got?

117
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,215
Full.
Totally full.

118
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,852
<i>Sing, sing baby...</i>

119
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,799
I got everything
from a guy,

120
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,149
he's worked this
fair for last eight years.

121
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,974
Blueprints...
everything you need.

122
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,999
They rake in a
big haul on Saturday and Sunday.

123
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,549
1.. 1.5 million,
not bad, huh.

124
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,428
So you think
I'll need those guys?

125
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:00,391
Yeah, it's a
five-man job.

126
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:03,051
How do ya
know this guy Melander?

127
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,821
Melander and
I worked together

128
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:11,179
out in Portland 20 years back.

129
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:14,310
Always had a good crew.

130
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,149
Independent, like us.
I told him right off,

131
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,450
if you're in

132
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:24,682
it's your show.
You're in charge.

133
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,490
Number 2, good to go.

134
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,712
-Let's go.
-What the fuck was that!

135
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:55,065
you stay with the plan.
Move it.

136
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:29,841
Let's go.
There's public panic out here.

137
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,621
C'mon.

138
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:49,959
All right.
Down on the floor.

139
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,849
Stay on the side.
Go out the back.

140
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:11,507
So, we all good?

141
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,519
You were supposed
to close the hay bales behind the livestock.

142
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,599
-Away from the midway.
-There was some trouble,

143
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,799
so why are you angry
about some big fucking deal!

144
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,649
Someone gets hurt,
the cops come after us.

145
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,747
-That's the big fucking deal!
-Mother fucker!

146
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:25,022
I said behind
the livestock pavilion.

147
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:32,596
30 seconds!

148
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,275
C'mon, unload it.
Right now!

149
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:08,289
I have to say, Parker,

150
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,611
you came as advertised.

151
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:15,348
so, I've decided to
bring you in on something else.

152
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:18,032
Something big.

153
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:22,519
Look, $ 200 grand each
isn't gonna make any of us rich.

154
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,212
But if we all kick in our share of seed
money towards the next little piece of business down line

155
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:30,814
we all end
up with $ 2m each.

156
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:34,719
We've just took a million bucks.
That's a hell of a lot of seed.

157
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,467
And that's just for the house.

158
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,263
I don't think so.

159
00:15:41,264 --> 00:15:44,439
Look, picture
one of those duffel bags,

160
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,399
only instead of $ 10s and $ 20s,

161
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,859
it's filled with
diamonds and pearls.

162
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,713
Jewelry is 10 cents on the dollar.
No thanks.

163
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:54,731
No, not $ 0,10.
I'm getting $ 0,20.

164
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:57,795
Parker, $ 2m each.

165
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,748
We got someone on the inside.

166
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:04,160
It's the score of a lifetime.
Guaranteed.

167
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,167
We made a deal.
You said we split the take,
that's what we need to do.

168
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:12,578
Why don't you think about it?

169
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:16,713
Come on. Parker, hey,
we're talking millions, seriously.

170
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:37,097
Ok Parker,
cards on the table.

171
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:39,299
I'm gonna need
the whole score for this next thing.

172
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,299
So, if you were me,

173
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,374
what would you
do with a guy like you?

174
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,719
Divide up the shares
and that'd be the end of it.

175
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,150
What if you decided
not to do that?

176
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,097
I'd kill him
while I had the chance.

177
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,724
Jesus Christ.

178
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,579
Shit.

179
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,800
Grab him!

180
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:27,547
Shoot him!

181
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:39,053
Grab him!

182
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:48,001
Stop him!

183
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,315
Son of a bitch!

184
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,469
What fucking idiot
fires a shotgun in a car?

185
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,862
-Shut up, Hardwick!
-My God!

186
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:07,163
Shut up!

187
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,938
-Go finish it.
-Wait, wait, wait.

188
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,738
Look, he's fucking dead.
Let's just get the fuck out!

189
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:18,300
I'd don't give
a fuck who your uncle is!

190
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,159
You wanna be a
part of this, go finish him.

191
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,299
-You heard him, Hardwick!
-Go.

192
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,270
Get the fuck out of here!

193
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,146
We got to get out of here!

194
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:32,589
-Handle your business!
-C'mon, we gotta go!

195
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,631
Do it!
Blow his fucking head off!

196
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,241
Fuck!
Fuck!

197
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,092
You're a fucking pinsetter,
Parker!

198
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:56,142
-You're so fucking stupid!
-Do it!

199
00:18:58,099 --> 00:18:59,563
-C'mon!
-Let's go, let's go!

200
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:14,350
I didn't get
a good look at his face,

201
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,279
just that he was a priest.

202
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,601
So far as his build, that goes

203
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,340
I dunno.
I guess I'd say average.

204
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,571
Did he say anything to you?

205
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,474
Not really.
Nope.

206
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,527
Looks like a
man's shoe up there.

207
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:35,956
-That looks like blood.
-Yeah, look at that.

208
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:38,013
James, stop!
There's a man!

209
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,199
Boys,
stay in the truck.

210
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,602
-Do you think he's dead?
-I dunno.

211
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,291
You boys hang back.
I'm gonna check.

212
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:50,175
-Oh Sweet Jesus, c'mon.
-What do you want me to do, daddy?

213
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,610
He's alive!
Take him from this side.

214
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,228
C'mon now.
Pick him up. Let's go!

215
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:00,669
Help him, boys.

216
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,780
You scrub my back?

217
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,643
All these scars,

218
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,800
if you came into the ER
with these many holes I'd pray for more.

219
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,500
That's why I stay away from hospitals.

220
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:42,499
Stay still.
We get you to the hospital.

221
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:44,702
We gotcha.

222
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:04,329
<i>A silver Suburban used by the
thieves who struck the neighboring Ohio State Fair on Monday,</i>

223
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,639
<i>was found in a strip mall across
the state in Cincinnati, Ohio.</i>

224

<i>Anyone with information is asked to...</i>

229
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,800
Don't get up.
You were shot.

230
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,622
-I'll call the nurse.
-Don't you call the nurse.

231
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,414
-Where am I?
-Kentucky.

232
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,292
You know what happened to you?
They don't even know your name.

233
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,662
-Are you crazy?
-Good morning ladies.

234
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:58,435
-Good morning.
-How' you today?

235
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:01,283
Ok, Mr. Quinn!

236
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,269
-Radiation is all set for you.
-Just a minute, the man needs some help.

237
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,215
Ok, ok, no problem.
Let me get you set,

238
00:22:08,216 --> 00:22:10,247
-and I'll check him out.
-Man needs help.
-C'mon.

239
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:12,069
-Get up, get up.
-He needs some help.

240
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,729
-Let's go, let's go.
-Help the man.

241
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,149
Ok. We have
to get to radiation.

242
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,569
-Pick your feet up.
-No.

243
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,549
Calm down.
Calm down.

244
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:26,062
Nurse.

245
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:29,726
Oh no.

246
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:35,141
Hey, hey stop.
Don't hurt him, please.

247
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,270
Oh my God.

248
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,670
Is he dead?

249
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:44,732
-He's dead. You killed him.
-No.

250
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:48,865
Praise the Lord.

251
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,660
Whats... what's
gonna happen now?

252
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,277
Please don't
hurt me, please.

253
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,751
They say he was shot?

254
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:14,725
Yeah, found on the
side of the road like were dead.

255
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,307
How long did it take you.

256
00:23:16,427 --> 00:23:19,099
I need the chair to
hold up my weight.

257
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,048
Don't call attention
to us and I'll let you go as
soon as we're outside, understand?

258
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,939
-Is he talking?
-No, he was still unconscious.

259
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,500
A farmer found him.

260
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:37,065
See you inside.

261
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,453
Hey, you look better.

262
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,679
You too.

263
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,380
<i>Blow his fucking head off!</i>

264
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,010
Do it!

265
00:24:57,308 --> 00:25:00,194
-Got it!
-Put it in the truck.

266
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:03,669
There ain't gonna be no ducks left.
I'll have to leave you.

267
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,831
Mr. Norte,
I'm a friend of Bob Hurley's.

268
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:13,485
Yeah. Listen,
I need some documents.

269
00:26:15,012 --> 00:26:16,983
Don't worry about the money.

270
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:18,946
I start a new job in the morning.

271
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,088
Do what I say
and you won't get hurt.

272
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:02,340
Mine's bigger
than yours.

273
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:09,453
It's not the size,
it's how you use it.

274
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,491
-Get to hell?
-You got hurt cos
you didn't do what I said.

275
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:16,399
Your bullet-proof
vest doesn't cover your legs.

276
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,353
-Next time I'll take out your eye.
-Who the fuck are you?

277
00:27:19,354 --> 00:27:22,176
Do right to
feel you weren't at hospital.

278
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,169
-They'll get you, you know.
-Yeah, so don't sweat it.

279
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,406
So, I'll have the money,
you're insured and they'd be getting me.

280
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:29,707
Get up.

281
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,949
Remember I've
got a gun on ya.

282
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,019
-What's your name?
- Jack. People call me Jack.

283
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,673
C'mon, Jack.
What's your partner's name?

284
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,950
Oliver.

285
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,204
You say Oliver, I got
shot and this guy helped me, nothing else.

286
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,240
-I got shot. Thank
God this guy helped.
-Jesus

287
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:12,551
It's small but it hurts.

288
00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:15,176
He knows we're wearing
vests, he'll shoot you in the face.

289
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:18,533
Now can we just get this over
with so I can go to goddamn hospital?

290
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:23,055
Ok, Oliver.
Put Jack into the other room.

291
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:24,685
I need cash.

292
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:28,136
You know they're
gonna get you for this.

293
00:28:28,588 --> 00:28:30,478
Yeah,
Jack already told me.

294
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,239
Sorry about the leg,
Jack.

295
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,993
Sit tight for 5 minutes
and we'll call you an ambulance.

296
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,019
Hey!
Come on in, senor.

297
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,958
You made
it in record time.

298
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,301
So, you're
Hurley's friend?

299
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:16,883
I'm glad you found us,
Mr....?

300
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,530
Won't you step
right this way.

301
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,079
You know,
this was my dad's business.

302
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,579
We make most of
our money at high schools.

303
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,299
You know, printing
year books, diplomas, stuff like that.

304
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,059
Need to buy a
car, get along

305
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,199
Name, birth
certificate and driver's license.

306
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,500
Sure.

307
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,958
Passport.
Anything else?

308
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,257
-Did you bring a picture?
-No.

309
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,119
Five days, my friend.

310
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,768
C'mon. Get out.
Run, move.

311
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:05,565
Hello?

312
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,950
It's Parker.

313
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,800
Yeah?

314
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:13,494
There was a
problem with the job.

315
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:18,596
-I need you to do 2 things for me.
-Yeah, name it.

316
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:21,435
First, let Claire
know that I'll be gone
longer than I thought.

317
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:23,473
All right.
You got it.

318
00:30:23,474 --> 00:30:26,199
Second, do you know where
I can get hold of that client  Melander.

319
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,679
What happened?

320
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,544
I invoiced but
I wasn't able to collect.

321
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:32,422
Oh Jesus, Parker.

322
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:35,061
Are you all right?

323
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:37,738
Where is he?

324
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,415
This is not a good idea.

325
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,827
<i>After you didn't call,
I did some checking,</i>

326
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:45,779
<i>it turns out that Melander</i>

327
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,699
<i>is not as
independent as I thought.</i>

328
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,106
<i>He's got connections.
Big connections.</i>

329
00:30:51,107 --> 00:30:54,982
We're talking Chicago.
Danzinger.

330
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,152
-So don't start anything.
-Hurley, it's me.

331
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:02,107
-Give me a name.
- <i>Listen...</i>

332
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:08,673
Hardwick is
the nephew of Danzinger.

333
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:11,308
-You understand?
-Gimme a name!

334
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:17,142
Jesus Christ.
All right, here's what I got.

335
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:21,915
<i>His brother, Bobby Hardwick,
owns bars on Bourbon Street,</i>

336
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:24,195
plus a
rock 'n' roll club.

337
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:28,387
Now listen, you be real careful.
These are bad guys.

338
00:32:11,454 --> 00:32:13,879
-Are you invited?
-Yeah.
-Right, go ahead.

339
00:32:14,904 --> 00:32:18,751
-I need to see Bobby Hardwick.
-Not gonna happen.

340
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,811
Tell him Mr. Danzinger
sent me.

341
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,259
Wait here.

342
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,287
Idiot!
Get out.

343
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,699
I got 300 people down
there and you're telling me
you only got 200 paid.

344
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,407
That means I
got a 100 fucking guests.

345
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:45,463
-Who are these fucking guests?
-Relax buddy.

346
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,649
Now don't tell
me to relax, you understand?

347
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,008
-What?
- Bobby Hardwick?

348
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:52,003
Out.
Private.

349
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,932
I need you to tell
me where your brother is.

350
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:57,853
-Get him the fuck out of here.
-C'mon, you heard...

351
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:12,389
Your brother went off on
a job with a man named Melander.

352
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,753
You know how
fucking connected I am, chief?

353
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:18,255
They took money
that belongs to me.

354
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:19,929
Tell me where they
are and I'll get out of your hair.

355
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:23,190
Do you have any
concept of the unholy shit storm

356
00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:26,229
you are about to unleash
by fucking with me, do you?

357
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,759
First, I should
tell you myself personally:

358
00:33:33,243 --> 00:33:35,848
I always follow through.
Always.

359
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:40,190
-Fuck you!
-You gonna tell me what I need to know,

360
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:43,294
or I'm gonna press down
on this chair until it crushes your trachea.

361
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:46,151
Trust me,
it's agonizing.

362
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:50,281
Plus there's the posthumous
humiliation of having been killed with a chair.

363
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,707
-Florida
-Go, go!

364
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:05,160
-Where in Florida?
-Palm Beach!

365
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,517
-Palm Beach, for chrissake!
-Bobby!

366
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,649
-You ok?
-Fucking get him! Get him!

367
00:34:49,697 --> 00:34:51,577
<i>Hi.
You know what to do.</i>

368
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,323
Claire. We should
keep that thing on.

369
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,039
Look, Trevor may find his
way up there.
Think you'd better talk to a travel agent.

370
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,020
Tomorrow.

371
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:20,405
-Yeah?
- Hurley, time for a vacation.

372
00:35:24,308 --> 00:35:25,608
Yeah.

373
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,187
<i>There's nothing
between Cheryl...</i>

374
00:35:58,188 --> 00:35:59,682
<i>Oh God!</i>

375
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:07,276
<i>There will always be
something between you and Cheryl.</i>

376
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,319
<i>Always.</i>

377
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:13,996
You're not gonna
wear that skirt.

378
00:36:13,997 --> 00:36:16,448
You know we can't
wear earth tones.

379
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:17,865
It's Tahari.

380
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,207
That's what's important.
Not your hips.

381
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,289
What do you
expect me to wear, Ma?

382
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,245
I tell you what to
wear, what to drive,

383
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:29,253
You can't afford it.
You know I'm not loaning you any more money, right.

384
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:31,949
Can you open my pills,
my hands are bad.

385
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,076
-I put them out.
-At least take Pipsy out.

386
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,800
-Leslie!
-It's your dog.

387
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:45,214
-But it's my house!
-It's a condo, Ma.

388
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:49,899
I put one of these
devices in this speaker.

389
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,361
When these babies go off,
all hell's gonna break loose.

390
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:55,289
Let's hope you
know what the fuck you're doing.

391
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,578
The beauty is, speakers
will still be able to work.

392
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,979
Hey, Bro.
No. Hold on a sec.

393
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,467
Now will you just
shut the fuck up and concentrate?

394
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,820
Are you sure?
Bobby...

395
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,925
-Look at this.
-Stop playing with that thing.

396
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:19,687
-Fuck!
-What the hell was that?

397
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,819
What!

398
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,090
-He's alive.
-Who?

399
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,175
Parker.
He knows we're here.

400
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,196
He ambushed my
brother, he tried to kill him.

401
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,395
Parker's dead.

402
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,549
He got out of the
SUV and you shot him, right?

403
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,283
-Yes, I fucking shot him.
-You...

404
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,159
I thought he was dead
when I shot him, I swear to God!

405
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,067
We need 5
men for the gig.

406
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,292
We can get by with 4;
don't work with 3.

407
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:54,593
Fuck!

408
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,725
All right.
Ok.

409
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,030
You get with your
uncle in Chicago,

410
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,599
and you have
me handle this.

411
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,787
We look
real professional.

412
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,600
Now.

413
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,665
That fucking Danzinger had better do
something for all the money he's gonna make on this haul.

414
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,620
The mafia doesn't
usually touch family.

415
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:27,299
But who knows with
Danzinger.

416
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,360
I'm not taking any chances.

417
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,922
Jen should be packed.

418
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,679
I'll be back and
get you in 15 minutes.

419
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,080
Yeah.

420
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,894
Hey, don't worry.
He'll be fine.

421
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,160
Claire...

422
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,368
it happens.

423
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:48,099
Yeah, not to me.
Oh God.

424
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,288
Dad, it never
happened to us.

425
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:53,342
Yeah.
Times change.

426
00:38:53,343 --> 00:38:57,340
I'm the one who should be jealous,
he called you first.

427
00:39:03,897 --> 00:39:06,623
Lock these doors.
All of them.

428
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,017
I'll be back with your
step-mom 10 minutes.

429
00:41:28,234 --> 00:41:29,534
Parker?

430
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,244
-Did you get my message?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

431
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:36,049
My dad came by.
Two minutes after he left,

432
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,317
a strange man with a
big knife let himself in...

433
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:41,188
was that a message to you?

434
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,149
Listen, drive straight
to the fishing camp in Okeechobee.

435
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,746
No stops.
No calls.

436
00:41:48,747 --> 00:41:51,841
<i>You'll be safe there,
but make sure you're not being followed.</i>

437
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,287
For how long?

438
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,850
I'll be
there Friday.

439
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,000
What if you're not?

440
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,227
Parker!

441
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,300
Empty the cash out of
the storage locker and disappear.

442
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:21,366
Look,
I'm 1 commission away.

443
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:23,977
I'll get it to you
by the end of the week, I swear.

444
00:42:23,978 --> 00:42:26,299
No, you don't understand.
I need my car for work.

445
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,163
If you re-possess my car,
I can't pay you, please.
Just... just give me another week.

446
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,620
Great. Thank you.
Next week at the latest.

447
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,009
Hi. I'd love an
Americano with 2 sweetners.

448
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,999
-We've got it all ready for you, Leslie.
-Oh, thanks very much.

449
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,799
Leslie Cienfuegos.

450
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,718
-Rodgers.
-Right.

451
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,894
How is the ex?
You heard from him?

452
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,379
Shouldn't you
be over in West Palm?

453
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,185
I like it here fine,
like you do.

454
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,234
Maybe you have a cupholder in your car,
or you just keep that between your legs?

455
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,877
What's large and black, Jake,
where do you think I like it?

456
00:43:13,896 --> 00:43:16,349
Let's see you laugh
the next time you get a ticket fixed.

457
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,650
Jackass.

458
00:43:31,703 --> 00:43:34,517
Don't fuck with us.
Just give us Parker, and...

459
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,837
I told you boy!
I'm talking to you!

460
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:38,539
-Shut up!
-Fuck you!

461
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,920
Do you know who we are?

462
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:41,961
You deliver,
or you're gonna be dead like Parker!

463
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:45,345
What are you talking about?
I don't know any Parker!

464
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,820
Watch out!

465
00:43:56,012 --> 00:43:59,375
-Dissatisfied customers?
-I don't have dissatisfied customers.

466
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:01,919
But I have you,
and now I have this.

467
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:04,375
You have a gun.

468
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,566
-Give me what I came for and I'm gone.
-You brought them here.

469
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:11,889
-Now you get down on the floor with them, boy.
-We had a deal, Norte.

470
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,809
I gave you  money,
now give me my papers.

471
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,219
Fuck your papers!
I don't need this bullshit!

472
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,099
Did they say
they were from Chicago?

473
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,999
-We didn't say.
-Shut up!

474
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,819
-Get on the floor!
-Did they mention someone Danzinger.

475
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,393
Look, I dunno anything.
All I know is I got a situation here.

476
00:44:27,394 --> 00:44:30,099
You know his brother, Ernesto?
He sold you out.

477
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,727
Daniel, I said
get on the floor.

478
00:44:45,946 --> 00:44:48,232
All right.
I'm done.

479
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:56,418
Hey, look,
we don't have to kill each other.

480
00:44:56,419 --> 00:44:59,839
There men wanted you.
I don't want any part of it anymore.

481
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,145
I'm like...
Sweden.

482
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,785
-You mean Switzerland.
-Whatever.

483
00:45:06,272 --> 00:45:09,349
Your documents are in
that little drawer right behind, right there.

484
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,650
Take them out.

485
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,020
Daniel Parmitt.

486
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,579
-Equador?
-You're an American citizen,

487
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,206
born in Equador.
There's lots of gringos down there.

488
00:45:29,207 --> 00:45:31,715
You family
was in the oil business.

489
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:34,517
Pick up the gun.

490
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,769
No look here, there's not very
many people who could do what I do as well as I do.

491
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,744
If I get dead, my people will be
very upset and they're gonna come and get you.

492
00:45:42,745 --> 00:45:45,841
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Who's gonna get me?

493
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,670
Pick it up.

494
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,700
Shoot them.

495
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,389
The other way we could
do this is I shoot them and I shoot you.

496
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:00,161
I'm trying to help you,
Norte.

497
00:46:02,503 --> 00:46:05,366
Listen, pal.
You can still get out of this alive.

498
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,320
Why did you stop?

499
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:11,206
They're dead!

500
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,037
Then they won't feel it.
Keep going!

501
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,120
Toss me the gun.

502
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,919
So now what?
You got a hold on me, right?

503
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,479
I don't need a hold over you.

504
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,229
Only if you make all this disappear,
and anyone ask, I never showed up.

505
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,808
-What do I say about them?
-Maybe they died on the way here.

506
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:46,443
Don't forget to
take care of the navigator outside.

507
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,500
Equador.

508
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,383
I just hate flying.
I hate it,

509
00:46:55,384 --> 00:46:58,299
and the goddamn
landing was terrifying.

510
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,362
When he went up on one wheel,
I thought I was gonna die for a minute.

511
00:47:02,363 --> 00:47:06,709
I mean, Jesus.
Jen's already at the lake with the damn dog.

512
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,924
-What about Claire?
-Taken care of.

513
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,099
-Promise, she's safe.
-All right.

514
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,993
Ok, so Danzinger must be the fence
to get 20 cents on the dollar.

515
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:19,734
-This is what how it looks to me.
-Yeah, I think so.

516
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:22,699
You know, US$ 2 million share...

517
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,095
5 ways 20 cents
on the dollar

518
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:28,699
-50 million dollar score.
-Yeah.

519
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,419
-So where in Palm Beach?
-No, no...

520
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,095
Parker, I'm telling you
Bobby was lying.

521
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:36,022
Not Palm Beach.

522
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:39,374
Look, the problem
is not the score,

523
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:43,200
the problem is Palm Beach.
Nobody does business there.

524
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:45,426
There's a cop to
every 8 residents.

525
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:49,009
Draw bridges, they can
check the island out like that.

526
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:53,709
You're trapped. The state pen is
full of light weights that have tried it.

527
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,940
You know Melander,
is he a lightweight?

528
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:02,945
No,
Melander's not a lightweight.

529
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:05,284
But it doesn't matter.

530
00:48:05,866 --> 00:48:09,209
Listen, I got
a call from Danzinger.

531
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,469
And for whatever the reason,

532
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,106
they wanted to
go down without a hitch.

533
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,551
So they sent me this
to give to you.

534
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,102
This is your Ohio share,
plus 10%.

535
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,704
Take it, go
somewhere with Claire.

536
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,499
Keep your money.
Who are you kidding, Hurley?

537
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,843
Chicago doesn't pay
to keep people out of their way.

538
00:48:31,844 --> 00:48:35,576
For chrissake, Parker!
Danzinger is a fucking savage.

539
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:39,248
He sent an assassin to your home,
he almost killed my daughter.

540
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,941
I'm just trying to help you.

541
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:43,206
I don't want it from you.
I want it from them.

542
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:47,086
-It's the principle.
-Principle?

543
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:53,019
You want to get yourself
killed over a principle?

544
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,019
Me, Claire.
Is that what the fuck you want?

545
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,888
You almost dies on a plane runway.
If it's gonna happen, it'll happen.

546
00:48:59,889 --> 00:49:01,774
It's not something you can control.

547
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:05,869
When I enter into an agreement
with someone, terms on both sides have to be honored.

548
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,749
If they don't allow that,
I'm asking chaos to take control over my life.

549
00:49:10,316 --> 00:49:12,178
Nobody likes chaos.

550
00:49:12,897 --> 00:49:14,378
Yup...

551
00:49:16,311 --> 00:49:19,767
Yeah, no one likes chaos.
Sure.

552
00:49:19,768 --> 00:49:21,238
Hurley, what if...

553
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,150
What is you had a place
in Palm Beach to sit things down?

554
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:27,719
Nah. Nah, cops
will be all over us.

555
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,645
No rent.
What if we...

556
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:32,386
What if we
bought a house?

557
00:49:42,776 --> 00:49:44,637
Palm Partners,
how may I help you?

558
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:46,788
Do I have any messages?

559
00:49:47,255 --> 00:49:49,371
All right, I will transfer
you to Mr. ...

560
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:53,315
Why do you even
read the society pages?

561
00:49:53,316 --> 00:49:55,999
It's, not like you could
ever go to one of those parties.

562
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,446
Look, a normal couple gets divorced,
they need 2 houses instead of 1.

563
00:49:59,834 --> 00:50:03,093
-If a rich couple gets divorced?
-They need 4 houses instead of 2.

564
00:50:03,449 --> 00:50:04,999
I know what
you're worried about.

565
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,898
It took me 2 years
to get my first commission.

566
00:50:06,899 --> 00:50:08,803
Even though it's
only a quater share.

567
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:12,249
I would've had my
first if Jammison hadn't swooped in.

568
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,958
-Good morning ladies.
-If I don't sell something soon,

569
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:17,236
-I'm screwed.
-Amber picked up a cold-call.

570
00:50:17,237 --> 00:50:20,710
some rich ass Texan
looking to buy his 3rd vacation home.

571
00:50:20,711 --> 00:50:23,282
I've been answering
the phone for 3 weeks, and nothing.

572
00:50:24,651 --> 00:50:28,525
They are great clients,
all in cash.

573
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,746
-What's Amber's line?
-12.

574
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:41,201
Hello?

575
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:43,059
Yes.

576
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:48,066
-Excuse me for 5 minutes. Thank you.
-No problem.

577
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:50,158
Absolutely.
I'll let her know.

578
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,846
Hello?
Hello?

579
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:59,609
That was Mr. Thompson.
He said he wants to close on Edgewater right away.

580
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:02,477
He said he's gonna be flying in at noon.
Oh, his phone died.

581
00:51:02,478 --> 00:51:04,497
I was on the phone with him...

582
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:08,065
If you want, I can go take
care of that for you right away.

583
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,527
That's so sweet of you.
But no.

584
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,230
-1 1 for the price of...
-Noella.

585
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:25,199
-Excuse me one moment.
-Call Mr. Parmitt at the Buca Resort,

586
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,149
and tell him that I'll
call him later to re-schedule.

587
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:32,775
Of course. Sorry about that.
The price was US$ 1,155.

588
00:51:32,776 --> 00:51:35,721
In item: 8000.

589
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:40,160
At a cost of US$ 2,353.20.

590
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,529
I can't believe
you've just stole her client.

591
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,014
There's nothing wrong
with stealing now and then.

592
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:48,058
They do it to us
all the time.

593
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,008
Mr. Parmitt?

594
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,256
Miss Rodgers.

595
00:52:17,744 --> 00:52:19,044
Yes.

596
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,060
Anybody who is somebody,
and rich, winds up in Palm Beach.

597
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:27,345
I mean, more billionaires
per square foot than anywhere else.

598
00:52:27,346 --> 00:52:30,281
Palm Beach is about
style, community.

599
00:52:30,282 --> 00:52:33,741
-It's, it's, it's not about money at all.
-Of course not.

600
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,989
Where do
you live now?

601
00:52:36,504 --> 00:52:39,746
I've got a place in Vail,
on the South Park Real,

602
00:52:39,747 --> 00:52:42,018
-in Maine.
-Yeah.

603
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,873
I'd like to see a few more
areas before securing in on one.

604
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:47,832
-Do you have time tomorrow?
-Sure.

605
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:51,087
Yeah, I have all the time you
need to zero in on anything you want.

606
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,238
I'll pick you up
at your office at 10h.

607
00:52:58,176 --> 00:53:01,251
I'll never remember my
way around unless I do the driving.

608
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:06,565
-Taxi!
-Can I drop you somewhere?

609
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:08,872
No thanks.
I'm good.

610
00:53:13,866 --> 00:53:15,838
-Where to?
-Lake Okeechobee please.

611
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,944
-Yes Sir.
-Take the highway 441.

612
00:53:40,473 --> 00:53:41,879
Morning, ma'am...

613
00:53:45,328 --> 00:53:46,857
Daniel Parmitt.

614
00:53:47,403 --> 00:53:49,590
San Antonio, Texas.

615
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:01,809
I though we agreed
no more scars.

616
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:05,148
I don't wanna lose you.

617
00:54:09,506 --> 00:54:10,806
Hey.

618
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,330
I keep thinking about
that man inside our house.

619
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:22,828
I've been around
thieves my whole life but,

620
00:54:23,205 --> 00:54:25,989
this guy,
he's a killer.

621
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,067
He really scared me.

622
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,718
They wouldn't have killed you,
Claire.

623
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:36,492
-They use you to get to me.
-And kill us both.

624
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:46,830
You can leave, Claire.

625
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:50,692
No one will blame you.

626
00:54:57,478 --> 00:54:59,930
This Italian-made villa
was built 3 years ago.

627
00:54:59,931 --> 00:55:01,882
It's only
US$ 17m.

628
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:06,249
If you were older and
1 mile down the beach it'd be US$ 35m.

629
00:55:09,418 --> 00:55:10,718
You like?

630
00:55:14,469 --> 00:55:18,929
You know, the furnishings are
all antique and they could be available for, you know...

631
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,364
the right price.

632
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:24,873
So, married?

633
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,923
Once.
She passed away.

634
00:55:30,988 --> 00:55:32,288
I'm sorry.

635
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,024
What about you?
What does your husband do?

636
00:55:36,197 --> 00:55:38,194
Divorced.
11 months.

637
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,907
He was a salesman.

638
00:55:41,158 --> 00:55:44,598
He sold me...
the whole dream.

639
00:55:46,154 --> 00:55:47,909
I thought he was something.

640
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,802
His Ferrari was rented.

641
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,517
At least it
wasn't stolen.

642
00:55:53,075 --> 00:55:57,200
Well, he declared bankruptcy
before the divorce, so

643
00:55:57,647 --> 00:55:59,667
I get to help him pay off this debt,

644
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:02,766
while he lives there in Key West
with his new girlfriend.

645
00:56:03,547 --> 00:56:05,063
A younger girl.

646
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:10,583
This one right over here,
this has been on the market for about year for about US$ 27,5m.

647
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:15,408
If you make an offer now,
you could probably get it for about US$ 19,5m-ish.

648
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:16,907
It's a good price.

649
00:56:18,919 --> 00:56:22,109
This is obviously
more of a neighborhood.

650
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,794
Right here,
with these greeen palm trees,

651
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:29,274
this house sold about 2 months,
for US$ 1,2m.

652
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,569
Mr. Rodrigo
says he wants to renovate.

653
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:36,169
Can you believe it?
It's obviously a tear down.

654
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,893
Mr. Rodrigo?

655
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,578
Yeah.
Amber sold it to him.

656
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:45,018
I think he said
he's from Texas too.

657
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:47,766
I'll have to meet
him someday.

658
00:56:50,436 --> 00:56:54,099
You know, the one nice thing about
it, the inner coast goes right down here wraps right around the house.

659
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,655
It's really beautiful.

660
00:57:00,781 --> 00:57:03,529
You see what I mean?
The inner coast winds up here.

661
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,210
So, you live in
San Antonio your whole life?

662
00:57:11,577 --> 00:57:12,877
Yeah.

663
00:57:13,259 --> 00:57:15,208
Since I was about 3.

664
00:57:15,794 --> 00:57:18,173
To tell the truth,
I was born in Equador.

665
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:21,688
My folks are both
in the oil business down there.

666
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:24,059
Equador?
Really?

667
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,731
That's what it
says on my birth certificate.

668
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:32,304
-Hey, Leslie.
-Hey, Julio. How are you?

669
00:57:32,874 --> 00:57:35,785
I was in a management
training program here before I got married.

670
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:40,339
I could've got you a great discount,
even rate, say 11 years ago.

671
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:47,409
Do you mind if I hold on to these for
my bankers to see if they have a problem on their end?

672
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,569
Sure. They're all sold.
I just kind of tossed them anyway.

673
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,774
Here, my card.

674
00:57:53,748 --> 00:57:56,954
Mr. Parmitt...
Daniel...

675
00:57:58,649 --> 00:58:00,269
I know that
you're in town alone,

676
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,759
so, if you'd like, we can
go over more places,

677
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,869
say, over dinner
or just drinks?

678
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,484
You are so kind,

679
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:11,072
but I'm afraid I've other plans.

680
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,384
-I'll be in touch.
-Ok.

681
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,925
Plans...

682
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,311
Pipsy, stop.
Be good.

683
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:09,799
Leslie?
Put on the soap channel.

684
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,877
Do we have to have the
soap opera channel always on?

685
00:59:12,878 --> 00:59:15,759
-I pay for it.
-I pay every minute.

686
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,147
I heard that.

687
00:59:18,951 --> 00:59:20,688
I heard that too.

688
01:00:12,862 --> 01:00:16,936
You see? This is the kind of
outfit you would look great in.

689
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,078
Don't tell me,
it's Tuesday night.

690
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:21,758
I'm off to poker.
You mind Pipsy.

691
01:00:21,759 --> 01:00:24,749
Actually, Martha's still in the hospital,
why don't you come?

692
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:28,119
We'll put Pipsy in the carrier.
The girls would love to see you.

693
01:03:03,702 --> 01:03:05,084
If he's in town,

694
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:07,551
we can't risk him
getting any of us alone.

695
01:03:07,552 --> 01:03:10,873
-We have to...
-Uncle said he has the best guy to take care of Parker.

696
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:14,198
Mr. Danzinger is going to be
very disappointed you haven't seen Parker.

697
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:16,291
Listen my friend,
I keep telling you,

698
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,015
I dunno anybody named Parker,
all right?

699
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,102
Nice new carpet.

700
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:06,191
I love that shit.

701
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,107
-I am ready to order.
-Sit down, sit here.

702
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:01,484
Don't worry about it man,
I got you peperoni.

703
01:05:36,287 --> 01:05:39,379
If you're free,
maybe we can go for that drink now.

704
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,928
Who knows you're here,
Leslie?

705
01:05:46,728 --> 01:05:49,835
If you wanna go somewhere more private,
we can go to your hotel.

706
01:05:49,836 --> 01:05:53,925
Or we can go to the office, I have the keys.
You know, Mr. Crin usually keeps the...

707
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:58,425
-I'm gonna ask you a question you need to answer.
-Ouch, ouch, ouch, you're hurting my neck.

708
01:05:58,702 --> 01:06:00,410
Who knows you're here,
Leslie?

709
01:06:01,345 --> 01:06:03,620
No one, ok?
No one!

710
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:07,676
-You're gonna love this.
-Fuck.

711
01:06:12,295 --> 01:06:16,049
You know, everything you did
in the car today was, almost right.

712
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:17,350
Almost.

713
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:19,547
But I didn't buy it.

714
01:06:20,534 --> 01:06:22,237
Is Daniel Parmitt
you real name?

715
01:06:22,238 --> 01:06:23,734
Why wouldn't it be?

716
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,887
Because you're less
than 2 months old.

717
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:30,907
You have a bank account,
an address in Texas and a drivers license.

718
01:06:30,908 --> 01:06:33,372
You never owned or
leased a car before this one.

719
01:06:33,786 --> 01:06:35,839
You never had a credit card
and you never had a mortgage.

720
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,945
You know, I've traveled a lot.
My family business pays for everything.

721
01:06:38,946 --> 01:06:42,324
And the only house you showed any
interest in was the one back there.

722
01:06:42,984 --> 01:06:46,354
-Mr. Rodrigo's.
-Really, you think that?

723
01:06:46,355 --> 01:06:47,655
Really.

724
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:55,162
You know, I looked
into Mr. Rodrigo too.

725
01:06:58,311 --> 01:07:00,247
He's only 6 months old.

726
01:07:05,285 --> 01:07:09,063
Ok, why are you parking
all the way over here?

727
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,758
We could've parked
right in front of the office.

728
01:07:11,759 --> 01:07:14,576
-There will be no cars there at this time of night.
-Let's go.

729
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:18,893
Unless you don't want
the chance of being seen.

730
01:07:18,894 --> 01:07:20,861
Is that what's going on?

731
01:07:21,564 --> 01:07:23,216
-Wait a minute...
-Keep moving.

732
01:07:24,676 --> 01:07:26,254
Don't turn those on.

733
01:07:27,399 --> 01:07:28,940
English accent...

734
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,741
I knew you weren't from Texas.

735
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,290
Look at that
A nice Chablis.

736
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:41,906
Will you be joining me?

737
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:44,827
Ok.
Well, I'm thirsty.

738
01:07:51,177 --> 01:07:52,540
I drink too much,

739
01:07:53,468 --> 01:07:55,107
and I worry too much.

740
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:58,341
Divorce, pushing 40,

741
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:03,754
I have a sister I haven't
spoken to in 5 years.

742
01:08:04,411 --> 01:08:06,346
And I'm stuck with my mum.

743
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:10,961
Doesn't look like she's
gonna kick off any time soon.

744
01:08:16,251 --> 01:08:20,759
I'm sick of chaufering these...
fucking entitled

745
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,854
wannbe "playboys"
who've never worked a day in their life,

746
01:08:25,776 --> 01:08:28,698
showing them houses
that I can never afford.

747
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:33,493
Laughing at their
jokes that I can't stand.

748
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,864
All offending
of their groups,

749
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:41,156
but not all their groups.

750
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,137
You never know, one of
these days I might just get a full commission.

751
01:08:56,404 --> 01:08:59,344
So if you're
gonna kill me, go ahead.

752
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:02,166
I live with a
snapshot on my future,

753
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:04,911
and nobody's gonna know,
and nobody's gonna care.

754
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,095
But if you're not...
I can help you.

755
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,110
Help me?

756
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:15,099
People in Palm Beach
are sharp, very sharp.

757
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,209
People like you only
come here for one reason, money.

758
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:21,538
And I dunno what you're into,
kidnapping, extorsion, robbery...

759
01:09:22,269 --> 01:09:25,699
but whatever it is, you're
gonna need somebody who knows the territory.

760
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,233
Or you're gonna get caught.

761
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,797
Take off your clothes.

762
01:09:37,066 --> 01:09:38,649
What?

763
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,909
I'm not sure if I'm better
off with you alive or dead,

764
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,271
either way I have to know
if you're wearing a wire.

765
01:10:02,526 --> 01:10:06,009
Look, I've been in a third
of the houses around here,

766
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:09,679
and I know the rest.
I can answer your questions,

767
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,115
and I can tell you what
questions you're forgetting to ask.

768
01:10:13,116 --> 01:10:14,927
And all I'm asking,

769
01:10:16,955 --> 01:10:19,878
is for you to give me
a small piece,

770
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,116
so I can get the hell out of here.

771
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,999
-Turn around.
-What?

772
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,714
Turn around!

773
01:10:40,331 --> 01:10:43,609
You know, even to find Rodrigo,
you had to think of that roundabout with me.

774
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,419
And all it do is
make me suspicious.

775
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:48,463
I mean, how many people
do you want asking questions about you?

776
01:10:52,241 --> 01:10:53,721
Lift your hair.

777
01:11:10,077 --> 01:11:11,377
Get dressed.

778
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,327
Wash up the wine glasses.
Lock up before you leave

779
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,326
I'll think about it.

780
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:41,580
Hey, Lionel.
What you say?

781
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:45,604
I've got something for you.
Don't blow it all on the ponies again.

782
01:11:45,605 --> 01:11:47,300
Tell me what you got.

783
01:11:47,301 --> 01:11:49,357
I wanna know
every last detail.

784
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:01,923
Leslie!
Ok, last chance.

785
01:12:01,924 --> 01:12:05,056
All this right here could be
yours for one low price.

786
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,348
Hey.
What's the matter?

787
01:12:09,364 --> 01:12:10,868
Nothing.

788
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:15,059
I bought a lottery ticket 2 days ago,
and I don't think it's going to be hailed.

789
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,925
Leslie, what did you do that for?
It is a waste.

790
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,629
Hello?
Mr. Parmitt?

791
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,900
Yeah, I have the perfect
condo I can show you.

792
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:36,280
I'll mee you at 1000 Ocean
Avenue in 20 minutes.

793
01:12:37,421 --> 01:12:38,721
Yes!

794
01:12:55,311 --> 01:12:57,987
Right on time.
You can park right there.

795
01:13:07,869 --> 01:13:09,434
So, I'm hired?

796
01:13:15,981 --> 01:13:18,601
You don't have to check me
for a wire again, do you?

797
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:23,356
I mean, you
can if you want.

798
01:13:33,517 --> 01:13:35,379
We've got work to do,
Leslie.

799
01:13:39,491 --> 01:13:41,809
-You're hard to read.
-Not really.

800
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,749
Let's just stick to business.

801
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:55,778
This is the deal...

802
01:13:56,584 --> 01:13:59,813
Don't ask me any questions,
because I'm only gonna tell you what I wanna tell you.

803
01:14:01,117 --> 01:14:04,351
The man who calls himself Rodrigo
took something from me.

804
01:14:04,352 --> 01:14:06,287
He's in business
with 3 other men.

805
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:11,997
They're here for a robbery
and they're gonna use that house to lay low when they're done.

806
01:14:13,297 --> 01:14:14,597
So...

807
01:14:16,544 --> 01:14:18,545
you let them steal something,

808
01:14:19,777 --> 01:14:21,371
and you steal it from them.

809
01:14:22,669 --> 01:14:24,108
I help you,

810
01:14:25,521 --> 01:14:27,037
and I get commission.

811
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:39,735
-You're gonna kill them, are you?
-I never said that Leslie, you did.

812
01:14:41,372 --> 01:14:43,279
Civilized people
need to follow rules,

813
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,813
I'm just gonna put things right.

814
01:14:54,047 --> 01:14:55,423
Where are they gonna hit?

815
01:14:56,174 --> 01:14:58,285
I thought that was something
you could tell me.

816
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,020
You don't know?

817
01:15:01,787 --> 01:15:03,087
Wha...

818
01:15:03,713 --> 01:15:06,880
-When are they doing it?
-I don't that either,

819
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:09,206
but it's jewelry.

820
01:15:09,207 --> 01:15:11,745
None of the stores
have checked out the inventory.

821
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:13,590
How large?

822
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:16,567
US$ 50m to 750m.

823
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,535
This is
Clinton's Jewels?

824
01:15:22,536 --> 01:15:25,017
You're fucking kidding me?

825
01:15:25,825 --> 01:15:28,819
Forget it!
They are gonna get caught or killed,

826
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,699
and so are you if
you are anywhere near them.

827
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,414
Leslie.
You can't leave.

828
01:15:34,265 --> 01:15:35,565
Is she your friend?

829
01:15:41,285 --> 01:15:42,709
Miriam Hugh Clinton,

830
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:45,199
was the first lady of
Palm Beach society.

831
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,535
She had more diamonds
than Elizabeth Taylor,

832
01:15:47,536 --> 01:15:50,249
and when she died,
she left the entire estate to Palm Beach.

833
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:53,957
They're auctioning off
for US$ 75m jewelry collection right here,

834
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:55,258
tomorrow night.

835
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:57,912
What's behind there?

836
01:15:57,913 --> 01:16:02,325
30 acres, a golf course, pool,
tennis courts, 2 ballrooms...

837
01:16:02,326 --> 01:16:05,526
and it's one of the only houses
that's on the ocean and the inner coast.

838
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,041
Hey, Miss,
this is private property!

839
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:11,518
Sorry guys,
just taking in the sites.

840
01:16:14,234 --> 01:16:16,024
No, no, no,
that's too much white.

841
01:16:16,025 --> 01:16:18,988
Take them away and
bring back some pink roses.

842
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:22,449
-And just what is this now?
-Speakers for the auctioneer.

843
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:24,599
Small ballroom,
round to the right.

844
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,312
Ok, you go to the left side,
Robert to the right.

845
01:16:28,313 --> 01:16:30,362
Report all panel
numbers to,

846
01:16:30,363 --> 01:16:34,499
Barry,
who'll be standing next to me.

847
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,793
-Where do you want these?
-Put the speakers in the corners.

848
01:16:39,165 --> 01:16:41,385
Right,
excuse me for a minute, please?

849
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:45,578
Go get the gear,
I'll meet you by the basement.

850
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:00,433
Stash that shit by the exit.

851
01:17:04,969 --> 01:17:06,269
Hurry up!

852
01:17:07,865 --> 01:17:10,283
So, have you been in jail?

853
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:17,984
You don't feel bad
about what you do?

854
01:17:17,985 --> 01:17:20,360
Not everyone steals
these things.

855
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:23,095
Some people admit it to themselves,
some don't, it's what human beings do,

856
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:25,058
That's why
we invented locks.

857
01:17:25,799 --> 01:17:27,996
Do you think
people in these houses feel bad?

858
01:17:28,497 --> 01:17:32,238
Grandparents and their
great-grandparents, they the ones who go their hands dirty.

859
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,258
I just mean,
how do you sleep at night.

860
01:17:37,582 --> 01:17:39,778
I don't drink coffee after 7.

861
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:45,316
-Is this the back entrance?
-Yes?

862
01:18:11,195 --> 01:18:13,454
There's a taxi stand
at The Breakers.

863
01:18:14,168 --> 01:18:17,650
-What's gong on?
-Out. Out!

864
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:23,441
Wait a minute. What's the plan?
What do I wear? I wear black, what do I do?

865
01:18:23,442 --> 01:18:25,713
Go to your office.
I'll handle this.

866
01:18:26,682 --> 01:18:28,800
This is getting old,
you know!

867
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,338
Welcome back to the hotel,
Mr. Parmitt.

868
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:40,199
You can handle the car.

869
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,935
Leslie,
someone's at the door.

870
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,394
Leslie,
someone's at the door!

871
01:22:35,812 --> 01:22:38,595
-Jake?
-Leslie.

872
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:43,212
-Do you mind if I come in?
-Yeah, come in. What time is it?

873
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:46,009
How the hell did
you get my address?

874
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:49,177
-It's sort of official.
-Don't let him in!

875
01:22:50,536 --> 01:22:53,189
At least make your
dog shut up!

876
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:54,643
Can you do that?

877
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:58,148
Yeah, what's going on?

878
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:02,616
It's about a man
named Daniel Parmitt.

879
01:23:06,178 --> 01:23:10,258
I don't even know how to
use this thing, that's why I always get coffee.

880
01:23:11,463 --> 01:23:15,179
-What about Mr. Parmitt?
-D'you know him?

881
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:20,190
Yeah, he's in town from Texas.
I showed him some places,

882
01:23:23,149 --> 01:23:25,597
and he turned out
to be a real time waster.

883
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:32,024
I happened to be driving passed Sloan's curb
yesterday and I saw you talking to someone.

884
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:33,886
Yup.
That was him.

885
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,724
I showed him a condo.

886
01:23:37,019 --> 01:23:39,632
You mean you can get together
a list of all the places you showed him?

887
01:23:39,633 --> 01:23:43,064
Sure. I have to get it
from the office, why?

888
01:23:43,932 --> 01:23:49,204
If there's a vacant place he knows about,
he just get it in his head to make some home for a while.

889
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,969
Shit.
Can you please get that for me?

890
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,241
Damn dog,

891
01:23:56,242 --> 01:23:58,299
always tracking in
God knows what,

892
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,935
from who knows friggin where.

893
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:13,902
He got into an
altercation in his room,

894
01:24:13,903 --> 01:24:17,987
with a fellow. The fellow went
over the balcony and he's dead now.

895
01:24:17,988 --> 01:24:19,963
We're gonna need to ID
the victim.

896
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,900
That's crazy.

897
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,425
What about Mr. Parmitt?

898
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:28,109
We assume Mr. Parmitt
was hurt pretty bad.

899
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:31,739
He ran out of the hotel, stole a car
and no one's seen him since.

900
01:24:33,309 --> 01:24:36,334
Well again, I guess I can kiss
that commission goodbye.

901
01:24:38,028 --> 01:24:40,226
They found your
business card in his room.

902
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:45,055
We dunno what he was into.
I was just wondering if you could help us out.

903
01:24:45,056 --> 01:24:48,055
You know, if you come by the
office later, I can give you his application,

904
01:24:48,056 --> 01:24:50,132
and anything else you need,
ok?

905
01:24:58,075 --> 01:25:01,351
You know, it makes you realize how dangerous
this business can be for a woman,

906
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:05,360
I mean, I was in places all alone with
him and he could have killed me.

907
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,461
That's why it might be good if you
started thinking of not being alone anymore.

908
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:21,181
Yeah.

909
01:25:26,227 --> 01:25:28,546
-Sorry to wake you
-No, it's ok.

910
01:25:30,232 --> 01:25:31,532
Thanks again.

911
01:25:41,498 --> 01:25:44,799
Oh my God! I cannot
believe he's not barking.

912
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,623
-Yeah, dogs like me
-What do you mean?

913
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,499
I need to get you towels?
Oh my God!

914
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,766
-There's so much blood, what
are you doing with so much blood!
-I...

915
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:53,786
-Do you wash, wash it and put pressure on it with a towel...
-Leslie.

916
01:25:53,787 --> 01:25:55,763
-Leslie, listen to me!
-What?

917
01:25:56,475 --> 01:26:00,548
Listen, get dressed get into
your car, find a pay phone and call this numnber.

918
01:26:00,549 --> 01:26:02,441
Ok, ok, ok.

919
01:26:02,442 --> 01:26:04,421
You might not get an answer,
but maybe.

920
01:26:04,856 --> 01:26:06,629
-And go straight to work.
-What?

921
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:08,819
-Yes.
-I can't leave you here.

922
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,993
We have to get you
to a hospital. You'll die by the time I...

923
01:26:10,994 --> 01:26:14,384
-Leslie!
-Leslie, go.

924
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,095
Ok.

925
01:26:17,671 --> 01:26:19,962
Ok.
Ok.

926
01:26:27,226 --> 01:26:29,905
Pipsy, you like this one?

927
01:26:30,622 --> 01:26:31,922
Do you make soup?

928
01:26:33,002 --> 01:26:34,302
Of course?

929
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,157
Hi, erm.

930
01:26:37,636 --> 01:26:39,467
My name is
Leslie Rodgers.

931
01:26:39,468 --> 01:26:41,669
Daniel Parmitt
asked me to call.

932
01:26:43,915 --> 01:26:45,251
Yes.

933
01:26:45,252 --> 01:26:49,334
Why don't you go ahead and take a look at
both places again before you make your final decision?

934
01:26:49,969 --> 01:26:51,832
Yeah, I can be there
in a half hour.

935
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,429
Ok.
Bye.

936
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,350
- <i>Oh my God!</i>
- <i>It's a... It's a person!</i>

937
01:27:02,827 --> 01:27:04,899
- <i>Oh no!</i>
- <i>Did you see that?</i>

938
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,853
Oh, that's...
so terrible.

939
01:27:07,854 --> 01:27:08,896
<i>Call 911!</i>

940
01:27:12,955 --> 01:27:14,906
You ladies have a great day.

941
01:27:15,406 --> 01:27:17,249
I thought that guy
sounded like trouble,

942
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:20,794
-I mean, Equador?
-Yeah, trust my luck.

943
01:27:20,795 --> 01:27:22,095
Are you ok?

944
01:27:22,936 --> 01:27:24,236
I'm going out.

945
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:29,274
If anyone from the police
comes, just give them the list of
places I showed Mr. Parmitt, ok?

946
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:34,133
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I just need some air.

947
01:27:48,384 --> 01:27:50,217
I was afraid you were the cops.

948
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,467
What's going on?

949
01:27:57,881 --> 01:27:59,213
Are you a nurse?

950
01:28:00,225 --> 01:28:01,525
I'm Claire.

951
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:07,279
-Leslie.
-Hi.

952
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,404
I named her after
Leslie, the "Y&R" wrestler.

953
01:28:09,405 --> 01:28:12,599
-Mum.
-He sister's named after Jennifer in Valley of the Dolls.

954
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,154
They don't care, Ma.

955
01:28:14,678 --> 01:28:18,406
I used to have a beauty salon,
and the TV was on all day.

956
01:28:19,072 --> 01:28:22,395
-I told you to go to work.
-I was. I did, I...

957
01:28:22,396 --> 01:28:24,078
I w...
I left.

958
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,902
I thought I was calling
somebody to take you to the hospital.

959
01:28:26,903 --> 01:28:30,404
I can't do that, Leslie.
I have something to do tonight.

960
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:31,833
Are you crazy?

961
01:28:32,185 --> 01:28:33,689
You almost died,

962
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:37,265
What do you have?
A mangled hand, a broken rib?

963
01:28:37,266 --> 01:28:39,689
-For this time.
-This is a real man.

964
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:41,801
You are in no
shape to do anything!

965
01:28:41,802 --> 01:28:43,803
You can barely even sit up.

966
01:28:46,432 --> 01:28:49,228
-Would you tell him, please?
-I can't stop him.

967
01:28:49,772 --> 01:28:51,028
He is who he is.

968
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:54,604
Ok.

969
01:28:56,595 --> 01:28:57,468
All set.

970
01:28:58,689 --> 01:29:01,146
Do you want me to call
a taxi or leave you the car?

971
01:29:01,994 --> 01:29:04,445
-Phone a car.
-You're good at that.

972
01:29:05,643 --> 01:29:08,677
Claire?
I didn't think you'd stay.

973
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:12,661
I know.

974
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,758
Will you wait for
me at the fish camp?

975
01:29:18,189 --> 01:29:19,708
You know I will.

976
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:34,593
I left a bag with his
clothes and some stuff in it.

977
01:29:34,893 --> 01:29:35,986
Thank you.

978
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:39,067
Thank you so much
for taking such good care.

979
01:29:39,068 --> 01:29:41,135
Please, it was nothing
Please, please.

980
01:29:41,136 --> 01:29:43,808
-Thank you, bye
-Come back to see me.

981
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:44,929
Bye.

982
01:29:49,077 --> 01:29:50,465
-Bye.
-Bye.

983
01:29:52,528 --> 01:29:53,830
Some soup for you.

984
01:29:56,848 --> 01:29:59,106
That cop
is watching you.

985
01:29:59,793 --> 01:30:02,632
Go back to work.
When you get back, I'll be gone.

986
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:17,099
Right. Everyone gets a weapon
and 2 electric clips.

987
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,899
Carlson, you have to be damn sure
that fire house is empty.

988
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,965
Relax.
It's closed for renovation.

989
01:30:21,966 --> 01:30:24,468
Hardwick, I'm
giving you my best 45.

990
01:30:24,469 --> 01:30:25,390
Let's go!

991
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:55,889
No one's gonna believe you're a fireman,
even volunteers cut their fucking hair.

992
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:58,205
Now, put your hood before
your jacket, show some discipline.

993
01:30:58,206 --> 01:31:00,199
Hey, he looks fine.

994
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,125
I'm more worried about
Hardwick on that goddam boat.

995
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:04,856
Let's go!
C'mon!

996
01:32:05,218 --> 01:32:08,608
-It's getting started at US$ 12m.
-It's mine.

997
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,903
-What?
-It'd look much better on me.

998
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,306
Thinks you're too small.

999
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,898
-That's sensational.
-It's beautiful.
-It's great.

1000
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:22,144
If you'd all please take
your seats, we'll begin.

1001
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:26,237
We're here tonight

Miriam Hugh Clinton.

1003
01:32:28,427 --> 01:32:32,035
Let me introduce our
celebrity auctioneer,

1004
01:32:32,036 --> 01:32:33,202
Lionel Fleming.

1005
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,133
Hello, and welcome!

We're here tonight

1007
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:46,306
to one of the great daughters
of Palm Beach's society,

1008
01:32:46,307 --> 01:32:48,104
Miriam Hugh Clinton.

1009
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,969
Her kind works and,

All right.
Let's go.

1012
01:33:35,861 --> 01:33:37,612
Move it!
Let's go!

1013
01:33:46,642 --> 01:33:49,615
All right, everybody move!
Move away from the building!

1014
01:33:49,616 --> 01:33:52,215
-There are millions of dollars in jewels in there!
-Move over there, Sir!

1015
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:54,823
Officer, get
everyone away from the door!

1016
01:33:54,824 --> 01:33:56,519
-It's empty!
-Don't let anybody in!

1017
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,313
These fumes are toxic!

1018
01:33:58,314 --> 01:34:01,699
You, I want you to put
a perimeter around this building.

1019
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:04,499
Nobody gets in here
but my guys, move!

1020
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,879
Clear it up.
Lock these doors.

1021
01:34:07,641 --> 01:34:08,941
Locking it up!

1022
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:33,213
Hi.

Hardwick's on his way
Time to go.

1025
01:34:44,876 --> 01:34:45,776
Let's go.

1026
01:34:46,357 --> 01:34:48,081
-Let's go!
-Right behind you.

1027
01:34:49,703 --> 01:34:51,688
We've got 2 minutes
to get under water.

1028
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,630
C'mon.
Let's do it!

1029
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:02,944
This is the Palm Beach
county sheriff,

1030
01:35:02,945 --> 01:35:05,044
you've entered
a restrictred area,

1031
01:35:05,045 --> 01:35:07,237
please move
away at once.

1032
01:35:08,315 --> 01:35:10,419
-What the hell is he doing?
-Doesn't he realize...

1033
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:12,702
Sir, there's smoke in that building.
Is there a fire?

1034
01:35:12,703 --> 01:35:16,336
Yes, there is a fire and the
fire department is there to take care of it.

1035
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:26,254
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1036
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,411
Guys, there's West Palm
Beach Department.

1037
01:35:30,412 --> 01:35:32,042
West Palm?
How did they beat us here?

1038
01:35:32,043 --> 01:35:34,467
-But they're already in there.
-Seeing something?

1039
01:35:45,117 --> 01:35:49,298
I told you once,
I need you to leave this area right now or I'll...

1040
01:35:49,299 --> 01:35:52,959
Break the glass
Stand back. Stand back.

1041
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,882
-Two more fire tucks just showed up.
-Look at this dickhead.

1042
01:35:58,518 --> 01:36:02,319
I'm not going to tell you again.
Please leave the area.

1043
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,144
-Do you understand me?
-Sorry Sir. Sorry about that.

1044
01:36:06,145 --> 01:36:07,800
-Thank you.
-Have a good night man.

1045
01:36:07,801 --> 01:36:09,101
Thank you.

1046
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:12,599
-Look, I got a West Palm helmet.
-I got another one.

1047
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,264
Put them down, it's evidence.
This is a robbery.

1048
01:36:15,265 --> 01:36:18,191
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1049
01:36:19,336 --> 01:36:22,100
<i>195.
We're gonna lock down the island.</i>

1050
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,754
<i>Secure the bridges,</i>

1053
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:32,199

1054
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,301
<i>we've got to track them.</i>

Driver's license ma'am, please.

1059
01:37:40,901 --> 01:37:42,583
It's really happening.

1060
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:49,914
Damn!
I'm not gonna let you fuck this up.

1061
01:37:55,337 --> 01:37:56,155
Fuck.

1062
01:38:50,469 --> 01:38:52,648
-They were freaked!
-Tell me about it.

1063
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:00,458
Did we end the job great.

1064
01:39:01,015 --> 01:39:04,549
-Smooth as a baby's ass.
-We are heroes baby.

1065
01:39:05,592 --> 01:39:09,148
The public loves us.
The public loves us!

1066
01:39:09,588 --> 01:39:12,536
Hey, mna, who wants a beer?
Let's celebrate.

1067
01:39:23,146 --> 01:39:24,867
All right, let's check it out.

1068
01:39:25,816 --> 01:39:27,116
What have you got?

1069
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,989
Let's see what we got, baby.
Let's see what we got!

1070
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:32,259
-Yeah!
-Wait just a goddam minute.

1071
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:33,700
Honestly, guys!

1072
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:36,634
Yeah!
Yes!

1073
01:39:37,746 --> 01:39:40,469
-C'mon.
-They're jewels, baby.

1074
01:39:40,816 --> 01:39:42,719
What've you got, Ross?
Let me see it.

1075
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,054
Check it out.
Look at that.

1076
01:39:45,055 --> 01:39:48,480
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-Now we are rich!

1077
01:39:49,571 --> 01:39:51,368
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

1078
01:39:51,369 --> 01:39:55,758
-I'm a real estate agent. I'm minding my own business.
I just came by to check the house!
-Get inside.

1079
01:39:55,759 --> 01:39:59,826
Look what I found.
Can someone tell me who the fuck is she?

1080
01:40:00,267 --> 01:40:02,981
-Who's this?
-Wait, wait, wait.

1081
01:40:02,982 --> 01:40:07,167
-Why the hell did you bring her in here?
-Cos she was peeking through the fucking window.
-I was just checking...

1082
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:10,146
-Sit down, sit down.
-Calm down.

1083
01:40:10,147 --> 01:40:11,899
-Shut up.
-You... you can call my boss.

1084
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,810
Shut up!

1085
01:40:18,698 --> 01:40:21,281
-You know what I'm thinking?
-What?

1086
01:40:21,282 --> 01:40:22,599
-Parker.
-Oh no.

1087
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:25,848
-It's not fucking Parker. You're being paranoid again.
-He sent her in!

1088
01:40:25,849 --> 01:40:28,218
-He's out there somewhere.
-I don't know anybody...

1089
01:40:28,219 --> 01:40:31,404
Shut that fucking hole!
Shut up!

1090
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:36,451
Parker's got to be hurting bad.
He leaked a whole gallon of blood in that hotel.

1091
01:40:36,452 --> 01:40:40,096
-The news said he could barely walk.
-The mother fucker's a rock, man.

1092
01:40:42,169 --> 01:40:45,150
He didn't die...
that fucking bitch!

1093
01:40:45,768 --> 01:40:47,221
-Where is he?
-I don't...

1094
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:49,106
Where the fuck is he?

1095
01:40:49,107 --> 01:40:52,237
-Tell me where he is or I'll shoot you in the fucking...
-I don't know...

1096
01:40:52,238 --> 01:40:55,019
Tell me where he is!
Oh fuck off!

1097
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:57,504
Do you want every cop
in the fucking road here?

1098
01:40:57,871 --> 01:41:00,158
You're right.
You're right.

1099
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:02,950
All right!
Get the fuck off of me!

1100
01:41:07,277 --> 01:41:10,180
You all right?
Here, let me help you.

1101
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:12,857
All right.
Come on now.

1102
01:41:13,784 --> 01:41:15,483
Let's sit down and talk.

1103
01:41:19,701 --> 01:41:21,880
It's ok.
Now listen to me.

1104
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:25,006
You don't want to die, do ya?

1105
01:41:26,430 --> 01:41:27,548
-Do ya?
-No.

1106
01:41:29,657 --> 01:41:31,432
Now tell me where he is.

1107
01:41:33,416 --> 01:41:34,613
I don't know.

1108
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:41,838
Check the house,
every inch.

1109
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:01,144
You know who those belong to?

1110
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,828
No.
I don't have any idea.

1111
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,002
Yeah, you do.

1112
01:43:01,007 --> 01:43:03,220
What's your
connection with Parker?

1113
01:43:03,929 --> 01:43:05,527
Are you fucking him?

1114
01:43:07,131 --> 01:43:09,497
What?
You wanna hit me now?

1115
01:43:11,016 --> 01:43:13,201
Go ahead.
You first.

1116
01:43:14,599 --> 01:43:15,888
Then it's my turn.

1117
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:38,720
-Clear. It's clear on this side.
-He isn't on this side either.

1118
01:43:40,852 --> 01:43:42,163
Where's Ross?

1119
01:43:43,599 --> 01:43:44,342
Ross?

1120
01:43:46,462 --> 01:43:47,181
Ross!

1121
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:51,442
-Fuck.
-Shit.

1122
01:43:53,524 --> 01:43:54,482
Oh shit.

1123
01:43:56,302 --> 01:43:57,637
Go check it out.

1124
01:43:58,182 --> 01:44:01,089
-Me? No fucking way am I...
-Get out!

1125
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:03,062
Get the fucking
gun out of my face.

1126
01:44:05,545 --> 01:44:08,162
Stop pointing the fucking gun at me!
I'm fucking gone!

1127
01:44:08,163 --> 01:44:09,734
Jesus fucking christ.

1128
01:44:13,812 --> 01:44:15,845
If she moves,
shoot her.

1129
01:44:21,234 --> 01:44:25,553
Why don't we just...
unbutton this fucking button right here?

1130
01:44:26,613 --> 01:44:27,340
Yeah.

1131
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,291
Lemme see what you got.

1132
01:44:34,781 --> 01:44:36,992
Bitch!
I'm gonna fuck you and then you die!

1133
01:44:36,993 --> 01:44:39,405
-In your dreams you fat, ugly fuck!
-Fuck you!

1134
01:44:39,406 --> 01:44:41,174
Shut the fuck up!

1135
01:44:41,175 --> 01:44:43,736
Shut your hole
and pay attention!

1136
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,342
Goddammit!
Ross!

1137
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,745
Parker,
we've got the girl!

1138
01:44:59,701 --> 01:45:02,627
You better come out
unless you want to see her dead!

1139
01:45:05,361 --> 01:45:06,169
Parker!

1140
01:45:13,292 --> 01:45:15,095
What the fuck are you doing?

1141
01:45:18,028 --> 01:45:19,329
You bitch!

1142
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:33,869
You're fucking dead!

1143
01:46:11,029 --> 01:46:14,193
Parker, you touch me and
Danzinger will hunt you down!

1144
01:46:14,194 --> 01:46:15,799
He will not rest
until you're dead!

1145
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:19,364
Listen to me, we can split this
up. We can use my connections.

1146
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,897
Do not make me fucking kill her!

1147
01:46:24,898 --> 01:46:27,075
-Oh my God!
-D'ya understand?

1148
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:30,499
-Go ahead.
-I will shoot her...

1149
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,761
Shut the fuck up!
I will shoot her in the fucking head.

1150
01:46:32,762 --> 01:46:35,734
-Don't let him kill me!
-Go ahead.

1151
01:46:41,012 --> 01:46:43,420
Fuck!
Let me explain.

1152
01:46:43,838 --> 01:46:47,559
You were supposed to torch
the hay bales behind the livestock pavilion.

1153
01:46:59,672 --> 01:47:02,037
-C'mon.
-Wait, not so fast.

1154
01:47:03,711 --> 01:47:07,071
-You shouldn't have come here
-I thought you might need help.

1155
01:47:07,072 --> 01:47:09,992
What happened, did you know
that guy's gun wouldn't go off?

1156
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:12,299
When I broke in
the night before,

1157
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:15,166
I bent the firing pins
of most of the weapons.

1158
01:47:17,536 --> 01:47:18,940
"Most of them"?

1159
01:47:41,884 --> 01:47:43,590
This is what's going to happen...

1160
01:47:44,324 --> 01:47:46,110
Take the jewels to your office,

1161
01:47:46,902 --> 01:47:51,403
find an a/c vent and put in the stuff
in it. Put the grating back on and forget about it.

1162
01:47:51,404 --> 01:47:54,740
You don't tell your mother
and you don't check on them to
make sure they're still there.

1163
01:47:56,559 --> 01:48:00,749
In about 3 months...
I'll send someone to get them from you.

1164
01:48:02,009 --> 01:48:06,330
It might take a long time to fense,
but after that done, you'll receive

You can't put that
money in the bank, Leslie.

1166
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:17,131
You can't go on a
crazy shopping spree.

1167
01:48:20,846 --> 01:48:22,146
Ok.

1168
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,626
-How much will it...?
-I get the first US$ 200,000,

1169
01:48:27,627 --> 01:48:29,257
it's my original share.

1170
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:32,142
The next US$ 200,000...

1171
01:48:32,927 --> 01:48:35,193
goes to my partner
who planned the job.

1172
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,945
We split the rest.

1173
01:48:40,498 --> 01:48:41,798
How much?

1174
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:46,432
I'd buy you a showy palace.

1175
01:48:56,982 --> 01:48:59,294
Oh sorry.
Sorry.

1176
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,757
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1177
01:49:06,671 --> 01:49:09,570
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

1178
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:14,604
I'm gonna lie low for
a week or so till things calm down.

1179
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:17,863
I have someone
driving to get me.

1180
01:49:21,246 --> 01:49:22,546
Claire?

1181
01:49:28,817 --> 01:49:30,836
I never did have a
chance, did I?

1182
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:27,635
-Danzinger?
-Yeah.

1183
01:50:30,753 --> 01:50:32,088
Who the hell are you?

1184
01:50:33,427 --> 01:50:34,727
Parker.

1185
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,330
All right.
All right.

1186
01:50:43,331 --> 01:50:45,704
I was gonna give
him 20 cents on the dollar,

1187
01:50:45,705 --> 01:50:49,044
-I'll give you 40.
-It's not about money.

1188
01:51:07,739 --> 01:51:09,852
-Leslie!
-I got it.

1189
01:51:17,658 --> 01:51:19,392
-Good morning.
-Sign please.

1190
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:22,243
-It's heavy.
-Ok.

1191
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:38,686
-Oh my...
-Leslie, who was that?

1192
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:41,919
It's the mail man!

1193
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:44,883
Nothing but bills!

1194
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,437
We've received
diamonds from heaven.

1195
01:51:55,056 --> 01:51:56,714
Bought a new house...

1196
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:59,769
he's putting money
to pay off our debts.

1197
01:52:00,141 --> 01:52:03,651
You know, I believe that man that
we found on the side of the river that day...

1198
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:07,462
he were no man at all.
He was an angel.

1199
01:52:07,463 --> 01:52:09,196
Sit here to test.

1200
01:52:09,982 --> 01:52:13,993
