38

Diana...

867
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:16,271
Diana: Boss, you have some time?
I have something to show you.

868
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:22,472
At first I thought one of the ***
has broken off.

869
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:24,860
But take a look.

870
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:32,701
Peter: Narrow tunnel
with a slight ridge.

871
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:34,503
There's something there.

872
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:46,513
[ Soft music chimes ]

873
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:56,419
Ah.

874
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:57,720
Leaving so soon?

875
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:01,255
Venice is calling.

876
00:40:01,322 --> 00:40:03,190
Mm.
Oh, y-you know what?

877
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:05,192
I'm gonna actually keep that
up here with me.

878
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,693
Okay, sure.

879
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:10,062
You know, it's interesting.

880
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,731
They searched Oswald's house

881
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:15,301
and found several of the things
he was suspected of stealing...

882
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:17,470
jewelry, Egyptian artifacts.

883
00:40:17,537 --> 00:40:20,807
But there was a Matisse...

884
00:40:20,874 --> 00:40:22,041
Matisse?

885
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:23,543
Mm.
Hmm.

886
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,845
It was rumored Oswald had it,
but it wasn't at his house.

887
00:40:25,913 --> 00:40:28,647
That's shame.
It'd be worth a fortune.

888
00:40:28,715 --> 00:40:31,216
Yes, it would. It's about
the size of your box there.

889
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:34,386
I'll keep an eye out.

890
00:40:34,454 --> 00:40:36,154
I could use the reward money.

891
00:40:36,222 --> 00:40:37,989
I'm sure you could.

892
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:40,759
Goodbye, Neal.

893
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:42,461
Alex.

894
00:40:43,897 --> 00:40:44,763
Be careful.

895
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:48,066
You too.

896
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:49,935
If someone's looking for me...

897
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:50,936
They're coming after me, too.

898
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:58,744
That's the last piece
of the music box.

899
00:41:01,748 --> 00:41:04,816
I'm giving up my obsession.

900
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:06,585
You're suggesting
I give up mine?

901
00:41:06,653 --> 00:41:08,420
Kate's gone.

902
00:41:08,488 --> 00:41:09,988
The rest of us are still here.

903
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:25,569
Goodbye, Alex.

904
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:36,845
[ Chiming stops ] [ sighs ]

905
00:41:39,182 --> 00:41:41,417
Whatever this thing's hiding,
it's not the music.

906
00:41:41,484 --> 00:41:44,286
I think it's a keyhole.
A key to what?

907
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:47,423
Could we get it
into X-ray?

908
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:49,191
Not without alerting somebody.

909
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:51,994
I don't want to take a hammer
to it just yet.

910
00:41:52,062 --> 00:41:53,695
Mm.
It could self-destruct.

911
00:41:53,763 --> 00:41:55,364
Wouldn't surprise me.

912
00:41:58,368 --> 00:42:01,770
Let's see if we can find
that missing piece.

913
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:06,308
Maybe our friend
knows where it is.
