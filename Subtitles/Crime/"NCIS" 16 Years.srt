1
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,006
(Clanging)
(Whistling, whooping)

2
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:07,740
Here, snipe!

3
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:09,074
Come here, snipe!

4
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,743
Here, snipe!

5
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:12,344
Come here, snipe!

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,345
Snipe!

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,047
Where are you, snipe?

8
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,315
Hey, uh, dad,

9
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,150
what do snipes
look like again?

10
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,585
Ugly.

11
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,654
Sharp teeth,
beady little eyes.

12
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,406
You'll know one when you
see it. Keep looking.

13
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,157
Run up ahead and see if you can
scare them out of their holes.

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,960
But remember,

15
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,761
they're attracted
to loud noise.

16
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,732
Here, snipe!
Here, snipe!

17
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,035
(Laughter)
Here, snipe!

18
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,403
All right, let's see
how this snipe's looking, huh?

19
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,470
Yeah, come on.
Here, snipe!

20
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,205
(Laughter)
Here, snipe!

21
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,173
Call the boys.

22
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,574
Hey, boys!
Dad, hurry!

23
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,143
I think we found something!
Holy cow!

24
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:49,615
What you got, boys?

25
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:52,217
¶ ¶

26
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,619
oh, my god.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,653
Shh.

28
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,155
Don't look, don't look.

29
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,222
It's gonna be okay.

30
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,791
That's not a snipe.

31
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,327
(Phones ringing)

32
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,796
Tony: Well, that's very nice,
but, you know,

33
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:41,133
when I told you to get buffed,
that's not quite what I meant.

34
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,469
Go ahead, Tony, let's go.

35
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,170
Come on, I can take it.

36
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,405
Might as well get them all done
at the same time.

37
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,673
Nailed it!

38
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,174
(Chuckles)

39
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,393
They're gonna keep coming.

40
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:53,611
Delilah says you cannot spell
manicure without m-a-n.

41
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,880
Tony:
Good for you, Tim.

42
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,682
Denial is the key
to happiness.

43
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,250
Please, like you've never
gotten manicures before.

44
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,251
I've seen your cuticles.

45
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,486
Oh, no.

46
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,121
Dinozzos are
genetically predisposed

47
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,288
to perfect hygiene.

48
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,656
God's gift, I guess.

49
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,258
Although dad has started
getting pedicures,

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,360
but the toes are old.

51
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,629
Oh, hey, bishop.

52
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,564
We need a little
female perspective.

53
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,901
Although Tim is bringing
quite a bit to the game.

54
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,469
Not today, Tony.

55
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,271
You two figure it out.

56
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,245
You okay?

57
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,779
Everything back
to normal at home?

58
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,148
Jake is safe.

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,382
That's all that matters.

60
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,218
Well, that's not
the only thing that matters.

61
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,553
You do, too.

62
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,456
Jake went through
a traumatic experience.

63
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,224
As did you.

64
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,159
And, remember, he wasn't

65
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,493
in the bombing.

66
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,828
Right, um, you know,

67
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,229
can we just not talk
about this right now?

68
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,665
I was hoping for a quiet day.

69
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,501
What?

70
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,869
She said it.

71
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,271
I'm surprised it hasn't
happened sooner, frankly.

72
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,506
What hasn't happened?

73
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,508
It's an NCIS thing, okay?

74
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,178
You never say "good luck"
in the theater.

75
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,546
You never say
"hey, good game,"

76
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,281
to a pitcher who's in
the middle of a no-hitter.

77
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,767
And you never,

78
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,252
ever say what you just said
in the big orange room.

79
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,688
Wow. Superstitious much?

80
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,356
These are not superstitions.
They are facts.

81
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,457
Hmm, okay.

82
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,859
Here's a fact.

83
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,194
We probably won't even
get a case today.

84
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,262
Too late.

85
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,397
Dead body in the Virginia woods.

86
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,965
Let's go.

87
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,569
Nice nails, Tim.

88
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,836
Oh, thanks, boss.

89
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,405
You know, Delilah said...
Of course.

90
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,941
You can't spell manicure
without m-a-n.

91
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,776
(Elevator bell dings)
See that?

92
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,244
Hmm.

93
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,413
(Camera shutter clicking)

94
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,416
(Birds screeching)
(Sighs)

95
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,585
I need to get
out of the city more often.

96
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,853
Clear my head.

97
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,623
Yes, a breath of fresh air
can work wonders.

98
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,826
Did you know that just listening
to the tree branches rustle

99
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:48,994
in the Autumn breeze

100
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,530
can reduce your
blood pressure

101
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,232
by about ten points?

102
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,700
For me it's all about listening
to the zen-like call

103
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,969
of a bird.

104
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,438
(Imitates birdsong)

105
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,939
(Bird repeats song)

106
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,575
That's the warbling vireo,
indigenous to these parts.

107
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,578
Gibbs:
T.O.D., duck?

108
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,680
Uh, I'm going
to let birdman here

109
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:09,982
hazard a guess.

110
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,283
He's doing a night course

111
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,285
in the science
of human decay.

112
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,254
It's fascinating stuff, really.

113
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:19,424
My final essay was entitled
"decomposition composition."

114
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,425
(Chuckles)

115
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,427
Let's see here.

116
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,364
Uh, judging by the minor
putrefaction of the body

117
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,765
as well as the presence

118
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,800
of maggot larvae
on the wound here

119
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,435
and the brown purge fluids

120
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,871
leaking from every orifice,
i would have to say

121
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,973
between 48 and 72 hours.

122
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,708
The bullet pierced
the trachea

123
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,343
and presumably exited
the back of the neck.

124
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,379
And notice
how the extremities

125
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,647
have been eaten

126
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,914
by wildlife.

127
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,717
Fingertips, the ears.

128
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,352
Well, no fingertips, no prints.

129
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,421
I'm go go prep
a DNA test for Abby.

130
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,823
Tony:
State trooper says a car

131
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,759
was towed from the shoulder
of the road just down the hill.

132
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,661
They're still
running the plates.

133
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:58,063
I'll cross-check dmv for
the<i> Buchanan's</i> manifest.

134
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,199
She was a destroyer

135
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,334
in the persian Gulf during
operation desert shield.

136
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:05,304
The ship's unofficial motto was

137
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,406
"defending with honor."

138
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:08,974
(Camera shutter clicks)

139
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,409
McGee:
Boss.

140
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,411
Bolt-action Winchester,
thirty-ought-six.

141
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,879
Definitely been fired.

142
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,315
Okay. Fired at what?

143
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,849
It is deer season.

144
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,551
Guy's not dressed
for deer hunting.

145
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,852
Suicide?

146
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,323
Possibly, but the angle
is unlikely.

147
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,625
I don't know.

148
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,694
Maybe he was sitting here,
just thinking about life,

149
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,896
and thought,
"maybe I can take myself out."

150
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,331
Boom!

151
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,366
Goes right out back
through the neck.

152
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,902
Yeah, and it landed
where exactly?

153
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,573
Hey, boss?

154
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,676
I found the bullet lodged
in this unlucky pine tree.

155
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,777
Dig it out.

156
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,845
Don't damage the bullet

157
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,413
or the tree.

158
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,581
All right.
Hey, McGee,

159
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,450
why don't you do
the digging?

160
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,352
That seems to be
your specialty.

161
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,087
And ruin the manicure?

162
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,421
That's not gonna happen.

163
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,489
Oh.

164
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,361
So if our victim killed himself,

165
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,497
I guess we're looking
at an open-and-shut case.

166
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,100
Quiet day after all.

167
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,468
(Phone chimes)

168
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,937
And that should be our I.D.

169
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,106
(Muttering):
Unbelievable.

170
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,145
Ow!

171
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,980
Told you, be gentle.

172
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,383
Splinter?
It's like the
whole tree went in there.

173
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,450
Look at that.

174
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,386
I better go get
the first-aid kit.

175
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,788
There's a lot of bacteria
in these old tress, Tony.

176
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,857
Might have to amputate.

177
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,925
Well, dots connect.

178
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,427
Car belonged to retired

179
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,496
lieutenant commander
runyan Hayes,

180
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,464
63 years old,

181
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,933
formerly assigned
to the USS<i> Buchanan.</i>

182
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,468
Two days ago,
his granddaughter

183
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,003
reported him missing.

184
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,006
Did you say lieutenant commander
runyan Hayes?

185
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,641
You know him?

186
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,843
Jethro, I need a word with you.

187
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,415
I'm afraid I must
recuse myself from this case.

188
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,749
I don't follow.

189
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,985
Well, because I know far more

190
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:03,588
about this man's murder
than I care to admit.

191
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,501
Did you know, commander,
that the trees

192
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,637
in gettysburg, Pennsylvania,

193
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,441
absorbed thousands of gunshots

194
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,142
in the civil war?

195
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,645
Historians call them

196
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,046
the "witness trees."

197
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,582
Tree's not a witness
unless it testifies, duck.

198
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,616
What do you got?

199
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,118
Well, commander Hayes here,

200
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,488
he did not die
of a self-inflicted gunshot.

201
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,190
I know. What else?

202
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,891
Oh, speak to a man
named Todd Bennett.

203
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,160
He's a fireman in
wolf trap, Virginia.

204
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,563
That's all I'm gonna to say.

205
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,499
I'm going to call another
medical examiner

206
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,234
to take over the case.

207
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,636
I can't let you off
that easy, ducky.

208
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,673
You most certainly can.

209
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,642
How did you know the commander?

210
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,847
Well, it's no secret

211
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,515
that my social life of late

212
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:06,618
has not exactly been<i> en fuego.</i>

213
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:10,255
Come on, duck.

214
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,723
(Chuckles)

215
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,191
You still got it.

216
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,793
Perhaps.

217
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,094
I've tried everything.

218
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,562
Online dating.

219
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,130
That was a fiasco.

220
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,699
Speed dating introduced me

221
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:23,068
to women that I disliked
even faster.

222
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,604
So, I decided to try

223
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,072
mental stimulation,

224
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,274
and I joined a group
of mystery enthusiasts

225
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,643
who solve cold cases.

226
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,512
Amateur detectives.

227
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,813
We call ourselves

228
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,749
"the Sherlock consortium
for investigation."

229
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,552
Three weeks ago,

230
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,554
the commander reached out to us.

231
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,823
He was desperate.

232
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,091
He told us that his son,
Michael, was serving

233
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,227
a life sentence
for a military murder

234
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,297
that Hayes insisted
the boy didn't commit.

235
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,666
He said the guilty man was...

236
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:57,636
Todd Bennett, the fireman.

237
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,271
And he was going
to confront Bennett

238
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,839
and get him to confess.

239
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,674
We advised against it.

240
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:06,745
You think that Bennett
killed Hayes to shut him up?

241
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,882
Oh, oh, but, Jethro,
keep the sherlocks out of this.

242
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,851
Anonymity is

243
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,786
of the utmost importance.

244
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:15,987
Hey, duck,

245
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,689
next time you're feeling lonely,

246
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,058
read a book.

247
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,830
All right, I'm listening.

248
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,065
Oh.

249
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,568
So, our, uh, victim, boss,

250
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,920
is retired lieutenant
commander runyan Hayes.

251
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,271
Fought in three wars on two
continents over four decades.

252
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,975
He worked two jobs to support
his granddaughter,

253
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,944
makaela, she's 17.

254
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,178
What is that?

255
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,980
It's a clicker.

256
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,915
No, on your finger.

257
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,350
It's a banana peel.

258
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,686
Tony got himself an owie.

259
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,020
Tony:
It's an Abby thing.

260
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,221
She told me that there's

261
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,824
these special enzymes
in the banana peel

262
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,626
that help, uh, extract...
DiNozzo.

263
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:55,827
Sit down.

264
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,896
Abby stuff.

265
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,164
Bananas.

266
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,833
Bishop?

267
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,969
That's runyan's son,
Michael Hayes,

268
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,138
inmate number 37260.

269
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,674
In 1999, Michael was a seaman

270
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:13,778
aboard the USS<i> saxton, </i>
when his division officer,

271
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,146
lieutenant junior grade
Brett swannie,

272
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,848
was strangled and killed.

273
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,216
The original suspect
in swannie's death

274
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,351
was a fellow
sailor onboard,

275
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,786
Todd Bennett.

276
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,054
He had an argument
with the lieutenant

277
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,623
the night before
he was murdered.

278
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,475
Bennett was never arrested.

279
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,326
Hairs found on swannie's body
matched the younger Hayes,

280
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,061
and that was that.

281
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,763
As far as Bennett,

282
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,732
he now works as a firefighter

283
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,700
only two miles away from
where the commander was shot.

284
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,836
Bishop, you're with me.

285
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,337
Let's go.
Abby: Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!

286
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,705
Yeah, Abbs, what?

287
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:41,806
I have good news.

288
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,208
It's weird, but good.

289
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,744
Um, the bullet in the tree

290
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,912
did, in fact, come
from commander Hayes's rifle.

291
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,882
The weird good part is
it didn't kill anybody.

292
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,050
Well, how do you know that?

293
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,653
Because there's
no human remains on it.

294
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,820
I mean, there's no way that

295
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,122
it could have passed
through flesh

296
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,890
and not picked up
some tiny little

297
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,759
DNA hitchhikers along the way.

298
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,961
So the commander was killed
by another bullet?

299
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,663
Shot by another gun.

300
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,298
DiNozzo, take McGee with you,
go back to the crime scene.

301
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,933
Find evidence
of another shooter.

302
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,368
Oh, great.

303
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,871
You mean go back to the poison
oak and land of splinters.

304
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:13,872
(Clicks)

305
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:14,906
I'll take it out.

306
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,008
I'm good, boss, thanks.

307
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,810
No, I'm good.
(Knife blade clicks,
retracting)

308
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,815
My version is a lot
more civilized.

309
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,284
Not popular with Gibbs.

310
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,452
Look!

311
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,354
The little guy
worked its way right...

312
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,690
Out of your skin.
(Squeaking)

313
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:32,791
Oh!

314
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,259
Good job, little guy.

315
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,294
Good job!
Okay...

316
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:40,031
Dear noble eastern white pine:

317
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,967
Thank you for
your brave sacrifice.

318
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:46,137
And Tony is<i> very</i> sorry

319
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,806
that he attacked you

320
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:48,840
with his knife.

321
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,775
And we promise

322
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,278
that we will find
and punish the person

323
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,479
that shot you.

324
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,947
The end.

325
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,082
Okay.

326
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,417
Abby loves trees.

327
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,823
(Woodpecker pecking wood
in distance)

328
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,991
I'd like to cut you down
and use you for firewood

329
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,193
all winter long.

330
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,461
Okay, don't even
joke about that.

331
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:10,462
You heard Abby,

332
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,463
you know what
you have to say.

333
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,797
I don't want to say it.

334
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,132
You're gonna say it.

335
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,433
(Inhaling deeply)

336
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,836
Dear noble eastern
white pine...

337
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,104
(Sighing)

338
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,239
...this is from Abby Sciuto.

339
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,076
She said you would know
what to do with it.

340
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,745
There you go.

341
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,179
There, I said it.
Are you happy?

342
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,749
I'm happy, and Abby
will be very happy.

343
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,321
McGee:
All right.

344
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,388
There we go.

345
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,527
Mm.
Trajectory doesn't match.

346
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,095
Well...

347
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,164
Body's over there.

348
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,899
This bullet came
from that direction.

349
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:50,969
Anything?

350
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,370
Uh, not yet.

351
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,772
Hey, look,

352
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,240
you're getting it
hung up on the trees.

353
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,941
Bullets don't bend, McGee.

354
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,912
I found something.

355
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,847
Ooh!

356
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,884
It's a wallet.

357
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,118
Look at that.

358
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,188
It's the commander's wallet.

359
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,790
Ooh.

360
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,859
So, if commander Hayes
was standing here

361
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,994
when he shot his rifle...

362
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,495
McGee:
Most likely at the killer.

363
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,264
The killer
would've fired back,

364
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,799
hitting him in the neck.

365
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,901
Blood spatter would be...

366
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,337
...right there.

367
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,241
There it is.
Bullet hole.

368
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,283
Tony: Bet this bullet has
the commander's DNA.

369
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,251
All we gotta do
is find the gun.

370
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,520
You know what? I'm not too sure
there's a bullet in here.

371
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,956
I think someone dug it out.

372
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,091
(Laughing): McGee, what
are you talking about?

373
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,060
Well, do you see it?
Look...

374
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,162
It's hidden by
that sticky sap.

375
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,832
Tony, if there was a bullet
in there,

376
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,533
I am perfectly capable of...
Ow!

377
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,303
(Tony groans)

378
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,504
Trees.

379
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,876
Faster, ladies!
You're three seconds behind!

380
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,112
Let's go!

381
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,347
Three seconds
could cost a kid his life!

382
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,917
Stop! Let's do it again,
no mistakes!

383
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,619
Gibbs:
Todd Bennett?

384
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,388
NCIS.
Special agent bishop

385
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,290
and Gibbs.

386
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,325
(Indistinct radio
communication in background)

387
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,060
That your truck?

388
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,229
Where's the rifle
for the rack?

389
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,430
I have a permit.

390
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,232
That's not what
i asked you.

391
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,800
Hmph.

392
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,367
There someplace private
we can talk?

393
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,304
There's nothing
my boys can't hear.

394
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,374
You know a retired Navy
officer named runyan Hayes?

395
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,042
Yeah, I know him.

396
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,445
He's been accusing me of murder
for the past 16 years.

397
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:41,546
When was the last time
you saw him?

398
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,047
Couple weeks back.

399
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,350
He showed up here
and wanted me to confess.

400
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,920
Only problem is, I don't have
anything to confess to.

401
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,989
And go!

402
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,559
That's when he took off.

403
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,294
And no, I didn't follow him.

404
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,363
And no, I didn't kill him.

405
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,399
Commander Hayes's death
isn't public information.

406
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,902
How do you know about it?

407
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,503
Private investigator
told me.

408
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,406
What private investigator?

409
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,974
Big government agents

410
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,976
can't even figure out
who's working the case.

411
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,913
You got a name?

412
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,250
(Sighs)
It was a woman. Older.

413
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,451
She left a card.

414
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,957
Ducky:
<i> Membership to the sherlocks</i>

415
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,927
is a closely
guarded secret.

416
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,328
I'll speak to them,
personally.

417
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,563
No, I'll speak to them
personally.

418
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,367
Jethro, that would be
a dreadful... horrible idea.

419
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,236
Why?

420
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:41,406
(Groans) The sherlocks
are some of the most unique

421
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,408
and forward-thinking
criminologists

422
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,542
I've encountered!

423
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,311
But...

424
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,380
(Quietly): They do not
play well with others.

425
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,950
Neither do I.

426
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,318
<i> (Doorbell chimes)</i>

427
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,386
(Clock ticking quietly)

428
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,724
Butler:
Dr. Mallard.

429
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,592
Good evening,
stephenson.

430
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,194
Is this somebody's home?

431
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,996
Oh, it's a family
residence

432
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,298
handed down from generation
to generation.

433
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,299
Hmm.

434
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,467
(Door closes)

435
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,670
(Clock chiming)

436
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,372
Can we just go in, duck?

437
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:25,116
Your secret knock is
"shave and a haircut"?

438
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,417
Irony.

439
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,552
(Lock buzzes, latch clicks)

440
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,423
Donald, you're late.

441
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,731
It looks like
we're right on time.

442
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,215
Walt osorio,
consulting detective

443
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,649
for the Sherlock consortium.

444
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:02,453
Uh, you must be
special agent Gibbs, NCIS?

445
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,189
And special agent bishop.

446
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,091
We're looking for
Judith mcknight?

447
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,626
Speaking.

448
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:12,296
And listening, to hear if you
have anything worthwhile to say.

449
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,232
(Clock chimes)

450
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,666
That's what I thought.

451
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,502
The quiet, brooding type.

452
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,803
Oh, Judith, please!

453
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,406
Anybody want a drink?
I need one.

454
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,708
Did you talk to a fireman
named Todd Bennett?

455
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,510
Don't answer that, Judith.

456
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,578
You have a very
commanding voice,

457
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,447
special agent Gibbs.

458
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,382
And big hands.

459
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,867
Oh, boy.

460
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,351
Ducky:
Fellow sherlocks...

461
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:38,222
I must apologize for breaking
the seal of secrecy,

462
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,459
but NCIS is now formally taking
over the investigation

463
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,728
of lieutenant commander
runyan Hayes,

464
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,730
so, please, please,

465
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,133
hand over any information
that you may have gathered.

466
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,269
Just like that,
eh, Donald?

467
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:54,305
Well, Walter,
you've always know that if

468
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,241
my vocation and avocation
intersect,

469
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,509
then my loyalties...
(Wry chuckle)

470
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,145
Well, they must remain
with NCIS.

471
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,715
Well, according
to city code 348-61,

472
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,685
the Sherlock consortium
is not legally bound

473
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,421
to, quote: Engage in

474
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,423
interagency cooperation.

475
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,792
You're not
a government agency.

476
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:17,462
Actually,
the Sherlock consortium

477
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,163
is a federally
registered...

478
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,298
Who are you?

479
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,499
I'm Lyle.

480
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,800
Shut up, Lyle.

481
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:26,571
Gibbs, there are police files,
attorney e-mails,

482
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,206
divorce papers,

483
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,141
all private documents--
how did you get these?

484
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:33,377
What we do and how we do it
is our business.

485
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,779
Our business now.

486
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,681
Lyle: Hey, we spent days
gathering this evidence.

487
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,116
You can't just take a shortcut

488
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,218
to get to the finish
line before us.

489
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,486
Okay?
Ducky: Lyle...

490
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,354
This is not a contest.

491
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:47,391
You've made your allegiances
very clear, Donald.

492
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,495
Special agent Gibbs, there must
be a way we could work this out.

493
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:55,399
Wait, I just want you to keep it
here, just for... aah!

494
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,535
We're doing this
the hard way.

495
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,239
I like the hard way.

496
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,743
(Handcuffs ratcheting)

497
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,812
(Groans quietly)

498
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,681
So, leader of the wacko brigade
is named Walt osario.

499
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,718
Goes by "consulting
detective."

500
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,554
Same title as Sherlock Holmes,
by the way.

501
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,389
Ex-cop from New Hampshire.

502
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,591
Five years ago,
budget cut forced him out.

503
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,262
Playing the role
of Mr. Watson

504
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,563
is Judith mcknight.

505
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,231
She has no actual

506
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,733
law enforcement experience.

507
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,701
She's an author
of airport

508
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,904
paperback novels.

509
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,572
Don't knock
the Pulp Fiction, bish.

510
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,942
You're talking about McGee's
retirement account there.

511
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,577
That's Judith mcknight.

512
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,946
Judith mcknight?

513
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,448
Diamond delancy
mysteries, no?

514
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,251
14-year-old crime fighting
girl, with pigtails?

515
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,420
And...
Okay, well,

516
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,721
you're missing out.

517
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,423
Mcknight is unbelievable.

518
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,659
Hmm.
And boy, did she hit
the mother lode.

519
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,395
Oh! Well, if she's loaded...

520
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,597
Maybe I can set her up
with my dad.

521
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,399
He's broke.

522
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,501
Anyway, moving on
to Lyle:

523
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,635
Last name unknown.

524
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,937
Date of birth: Unknown.

525
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,805
His only I.D. Card...

526
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,509
Hey! He's a platinum member
of the frequent eater's club

527
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,543
at popper's pizza.

528
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,678
And that's it.

529
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,346
You think he's a threat?

530
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,481
I would say,
to a two-topping
medium pizza,

531
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,217
he's a severe threat.

532
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,952
Those three lunatics
are in the conference room.

533
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,287
Find out what they know
and get 'em outta here.

534
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,923
The three of ya.

535
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,758
Go!

536
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,531
Let me get this bad boy
autographed.

537
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:37,001
Thank you.

538
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,836
Here's some marshmallows.
They're good.

539
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:39,904
No, thank you.

540
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,540
Agent Gibbs?

541
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,908
We appreciate you
calling us.

542
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,244
This has been
a very difficult time.

543
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,578
But as...

544
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,714
Friends of the family,

545
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,849
we are honored to be
makaela's guardians now.

546
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,485
The commander was
a very special man.

547
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,587
He was like another father
to me, in many ways.

548
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,923
We found these in your
grandfather's wallet.

549
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,593
I think he'd want
you to have them.

550
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,998
Makaela (Voice breaking):
I didn't know he kept this.

551
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,934
Proud of his family.

552
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,304
Proud of you.

553
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,941
(Makaela sniffles)

554
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,744
Everything he did,
he did for me or for my dad.

555
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,982
Agent Gibbs,
can I have a moment?

556
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,290
I think I should be the one
to tell Michael about his dad.

557
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,425
You two close?

558
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:35,660
(Scoffs)
We're like brothers.

559
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,962
We served on
the<i> Saxon</i> together.

560
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,531
We went through hell
together.

561
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,866
Every time I'm in town,

562
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:44,535
I still visit Michael,
once a month.

563
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,671
He's one of
the best men I know.

564
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,406
You think he's innocent?

565
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,077
I don't think. I know.

566
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,548
So tell me
about lieutenant swannie,

567
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,550
your division officer.

568
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:02,553
(Sighs) That son of a bitch
still gives me nightmares.

569
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,088
His death?

570
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,023
His life.

571
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,459
He was a sick bastard
who wasn't fit to lead.

572
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,660
We were just kids.

573
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,828
He ruined us.

574
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,697
Are you talking
about the hazing?

575
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:13,798
That I could've dealt with.

576
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,965
It was more...

577
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:16,667
Psychological.

578
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,602
He broke us.

579
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,638
And he broke Bennett, too?

580
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,007
There's only two ways to deal
with someone like swannie--

581
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,642
either beat them, or join them.

582
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,610
Bennett joined him.

583
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:27,745
Commander Hayes
was a good man.

584
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:30,548
A loving grandfather.

585
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,882
All he wanted to know
was the truth,

586
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,050
and look where it got him.

587
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,652
Now makaela's father

588
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,554
is in jail for a crime
he didn't commit,

589
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:37,888
the old man is dead,

590
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,623
and makaela suffers
all over again.

591
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,958
(Phone ringing)

592
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,793
I guess we don't always
get what we deserve, do we?

593
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,830
Yeah, McGee,
what do you want?

594
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,632
Boss, is there any way you can
come to the conference room?

595
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,668
The sherlocks have uncovered
something that you should know.

596
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,136
Are you talking
about commander Hayes?

597
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,471
No, actually,

598
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,705
his son, Michael.

599
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,006
We think he might be innocent.

600
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,544
(Sighs)
(Indistinct chatter)

601
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,613
Gibbs, been out forever...

602
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,948
Special agent Gibbs, we have...
Somebody talk to me.

603
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,650
Other than her.

604
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,552
Runyan Hayes's son, Michael,

605
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,787
was convicted for murdering
his division officer

606
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,922
and we think the forensic test

607
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,592
that linked Michael
to the murder was flawed.

608
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:15,726
Flawed how?

609
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,961
Discredited, Gibbs.

610
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:18,996
As in, it's no longer

611
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,699
an accepted part
of the legal process.

612
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,701
The murder happened in 1999,

613
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,736
before DNA tests
became the standard.

614
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,706
So when the hairs were found
on lieutenant swannie's body,

615
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,124
a test called

616
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,541
the microscopic
hair comparison analysis

617
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,910
was performed.

618
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,013
The test matched the hairs
to Michael Hayes.

619
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,181
And?

620
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,582
And that test couldn't match

621
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,017
a pair of socks.

622
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,452
Take a look at this report

623
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,920
from the national academy
of sciences.

624
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,890
It calls the hair test
"highly unreliable."

625
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,959
And the FBI sent out
this press release,

626
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:53,164
and it says that microscopic
hair analysis is bupkis.

627
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,699
That's not technically
the quote, but...

628
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,903
In the '80s and '90s, there were
more than 3,000 federal cases

629
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,504
involving this hair analysis,

630
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,540
and right now,

631
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,476
the FBI is re-examining
every one of them.

632
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:09,013
Yeah, and that means that
my buddy fornell will be busy.

633
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,849
This is not our problem.

634
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,586
No, Gibbs, it is our problem.

635
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,889
The forensic scientist
who performed the test

636
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,524
and testified
at Michael's trial...

637
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,994
...was Abby Sciuto.

638
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,510
I knew it. I knew it.

639
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,011
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

640
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,480
Abbs...

641
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,914
I knew this would happen.

642
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,583
Ow.

643
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,686
When I saw that press release,

644
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:51,188
I went back and I found
12 cases where I used

645
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,624
microscopic hair analysis.

646
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:56,077
I sent them all to the FBI,

647
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,529
and I've been waiting
and waiting and waiting
for the results.

648
00:24:58,531 --> 00:24:59,864
Take a look at this.
Tell me what you see?

649
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,499
Uh...

650
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,267
Two hairs, both brown.

651
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,602
Actually, kind of gray.

652
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,170
(Chuckles)

653
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,639
Forensic scientists compare
ten different attributes

654
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,841
of the hair, including color,

655
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,177
the thickness,
the pigment distribution.

656
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,912
I don't see any gray.

657
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,213
I'd say they're identical.

658
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,849
Wrong.

659
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,151
The one on the left
is yours, Tony.

660
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,053
The one on the right
is McGee's.

661
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,122
How'd you get mine?

662
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,525
I just got it off your jacket
when you first walked in.

663
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:28,659
But that's not the point.

664
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,294
The point is that
i should have known.

665
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,162
Or I should have checked.

666
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,298
Or I should have... something.

667
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,233
Just put it out of your mind

668
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,235
until the FBI finishes
doing their retesting.

669
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,303
When will that be?

670
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:40,170
Two weeks!

671
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,805
I can't wait that long.

672
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,275
I mean, this is my whole world.

673
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:47,144
Can you imagine if I,
if I messed up?

674
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,313
What that really means?

675
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,682
It means that innocent people

676
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:54,118
went to jail because of me.

677
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,154
Because of my mistakes!

678
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,223
<i> (Buzzer sounds)</i>

679
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,292
(Indistinct chatter)

680
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,972
Michael.

681
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,607
What's wrong?

682
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,008
Who is she, Jason?

683
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,911
I'm so sorry, Michael.

684
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,581
Man, what is this?

685
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,849
Listen, I don't know
how to tell you this, okay,

686
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,052
so I'm just going to say it.

687
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:32,756
Your father's dead.

688
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,992
Runyan was murdered.

689
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,230
When?

690
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,599
Hard to tell.

691
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,233
About a week.

692
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:46,136
They found him
in the woods.

693
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,705
Bennett do this, too?

694
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:50,107
I don't know, maybe.

695
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,775
NCIS seems to think so.

696
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,277
NCIS?

697
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,246
They're helping us
now, Michael.

698
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,948
Okay, th-th-they're
working with us.

699
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,518
No, no.

700
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,087
Michael, everybody's just
looking for the truth here.

701
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,655
Is she one of them?

702
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:05,923
Put her on the phone.

703
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:07,291
Michael.

704
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,360
Do it.

705
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:19,970
Mr. Hayes,

706
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,405
I'm special agent bishop.

707
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,307
Now you listen to me.

708
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,209
You stay away from my family.

709
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,944
Stay away from my daughter.

710
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,245
We're just trying to help.

711
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,380
Oh, like you helped me

712
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,098
back then?

713
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:32,815
Like you listened to me
all those years ago?

714
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,418
We're trying to find
your father's killer.

715
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,786
Like you found

716
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,855
lieutenant swannie's killer,
right?

717
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,323
(Scoffs)

718
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,226
Why don't you just blame me
for my father's murder?

719
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,030
Look,

720
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,998
um, agent bishop...

721
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,767
Right?

722
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,169
You want to help me?

723
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,304
Let me hug my daughter.

724
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,307
This glass, this phone.

725
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:01,879
I haven't held her hand
in 16 years.

726
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:06,417
I just want my baby back.

727
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:10,788
Can... can NCIS help me do that?

728
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,794
(Dramatic music playing)

729
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,362
(Knocking at door)

730
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,564
It's open!

731
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,765
(Door creaks open)
Judith:
Special agent Gibbs.

732
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:25,169
There is no Gibbs here.

733
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,904
(Door closes)

734
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,106
We just need three minutes
of your time.

735
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,477
You got two.

736
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,746
Nice place.

737
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:38,415
Looks like one of those
make-believe houses

738
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,451
that they used to nuke
in the desert in the '40s.

739
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,286
Judith:
Mm, I like it.

740
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,488
Just needs a woman's touch.

741
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,989
You know,
you're a good sport.

742
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,157
I know you don't want

743
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,159
anything to do with me.

744
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,161
Even though I could keep you

745
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,198
like the triple-crown stud
that you are.

746
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,499
How did you find my house?

747
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:56,867
Walt:
Former p.D., remember?

748
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,870
I could find a flea
on a rat's anus.

749
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,240
Brought you a peace offering.

750
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,374
Pegged you

751
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:07,745
as a jerky guy
the second we met.

752
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,047
Minute, 30.

753
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,181
I'll get right to it.

754
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,850
Look, we all
want the same thing here.

755
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:16,053
Justice
for commander runyan Hayes,

756
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,388
and now for his son,
Michael, too.

757
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,024
We're asking NCIS
to consider

758
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,962
formally reopening
the 1999 murder investigation.

759
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,463
What's in the basement?

760
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,031
Hey! None of your business.

761
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,199
Come back here.

762
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,201
Is it your naughty room?

763
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:34,104
Want to know my safe word?

764
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,407
Kielbasa.

765
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,444
You know what
your problem is, Gibbs?

766
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,546
Yeah, the three of you.

767
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:43,447
The law.

768
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,450
Got to abide by it, right?

769
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,418
But the law can also

770
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,054
be an impediment
for those people

771
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:54,124
trying to uphold it.

772
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,926
Makes things tough
to get done,

773
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:57,795
if you know what I mean.

774
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,429
40 seconds.

775
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:02,966
The Sherlock consortium doesn't
need to play by the rules.

776
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,535
How do you think
we got fireman

777
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:06,503
Todd Bennett's divorce papers?

778
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,506
He has a history of
domestic violence.

779
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:12,509
My gut tells me
he killed commander Hayes.

780
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,211
Okay, but he's got an alibi

781
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,013
for the night
the commander died.

782
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:18,182
Got 15 witnesses to back him up.

783
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,951
Which is why you couldn't get
a warrant to search his house.

784
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:24,555
But let's say we
search his house.

785
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:26,390
Well, then I'd have
to arrest you.

786
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:27,524
Team up with the sherlocks.

787
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:28,926
What do you say?

788
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,994
No.

789
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,497
Well, you can think
about it.

790
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,898
Hmm.

791
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,569
(Sighs)
It's been really nice

792
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:41,004
talking to you, sunshine.

793
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,474
I hope we get
to do it again soon.

794
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,577
Just the two of us.

795
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,612
I'm asleep, right?

796
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,915
This is a dream.

797
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,986
Close your eyes

798
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:58,222
and keep dreaming.

799
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:59,623
It gets better

800
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,892
and better.

801
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,463
(Door opens)

802
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,432
¶ ¶

803
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:09,600
you happy now, bishop?

804
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:11,535
(Scoffs)
Two unsolved murders,

805
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,503
Abby's in hell,
I'm in pain,

806
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,639
NCIS is teaming up with
a bunch of fruitcakes.

807
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,241
It's armageddon.

808
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:19,409
I didn't do this.
Ha!

809
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,612
Well, the banana peel
didn't work this time.

810
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:24,615
Abby says raisin enzymes
do the same thing.

811
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,283
But the splinter's

812
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,452
not coming out.

813
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:29,620
No. No.

814
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:32,089
You cannot blame me
for your finger, too.

815
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,357
Yes, I can.
Absolutely, he can.

816
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,626
(Sighs) Okay.

817
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:38,962
I'm not saying
i believe in this voodoo stuff,

818
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:41,899
because I don't.

819
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,902
But if I did,

820
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,637
is there something I could do
to reverse the curse?

821
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,172
No. (Mouths)

822
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,941
Well, there is one
thing she could do,

823
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,376
but I don't think
she'd like it.

824
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,077
No.
What?

825
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,312
It's too awful.

826
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,915
(Bell jingling)

827
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,285
What do we got?

828
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,419
We've got this.
Thanks.

829
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:06,590
Okay, I give up.

830
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,292
Tony:
It's a silicone impression

831
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,027
of the hole in the tree made
by the mystery bullet

832
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:11,061
that killed the commander.

833
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,963
Mcmoldmaker and I

834
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,932
grabbed it when we were
in the woods together.

835
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,434
McGee: Abby was hoping to use
it to figure out striations,

836
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,403
but these grooves
did not come from a bullet.

837
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,605
They were made by a car key,
probably the only tool

838
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,941
the killer could find to dig
the bullet out of the tree.

839
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:26,109
And what kind of car does
that key fit?

840
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,312
Impression wasn't clear enough
to pin down.

841
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:30,180
But Abby made
a list of possibilities.

842
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,115
Mostly trucks
and luxury vehicles.

843
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,451
Why are you telling me this
and not Abby?

844
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,287
Abby's not doing too well.

845
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,989
She locked herself in her lab.

846
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,524
Spent the night there
last night, boss.

847
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:42,192
Yeah, she won't rest
until she finds out

848
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,994
if Michael Hayes
is innocent.

849
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,662
The FBI is handling that.

850
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,397
Yeah, but it's gonna
take two weeks,

851
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,032
so we can either
wait for the FBI,

852
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:52,035
or we can do the DNA tests
ourselves, today.

853
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,604
All we need
is Michael's DNA.

854
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,373
Prison probably has
that record on file.

855
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,109
How far is the prison
from here?

856
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:00,143
Hour and a half.

857
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,278
Start driving.

858
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,980
I'll make the call.

859
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,014
(Phone beeps)

860
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,450
Gibbs:
Abbs!

861
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,151
Found you.

862
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,354
It's a... it's a little
cluttered in here.

863
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:11,722
Ya think?

864
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:14,091
I'm just...
Going over a few...

865
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,326
Old cases.

866
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,529
Actually, every case
I've ever worked on.

867
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,731
Why?

868
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,699
Triple checking all my work.

869
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,401
It may take a few days.

870
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,753
Days?

871
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,104
(Sighs)
You want to talk about days?

872
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:29,339
How about 5,953 days

873
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:33,343
that Michael Hayes has been
sitting in prison because of me.

874
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,345
Because of a flawed test.

875
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,381
A flawed test that I conducted.

876
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,383
It only matters that
you did your best.

877
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,485
No... (Groans)

878
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:45,422
Gibbs, no, that is what you say
to someone who fails.

879
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,759
I mean, I know... I did my best.

880
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:51,461
And I know that sometimes
mistakes are made.

881
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,264
And I know Michael Hayes
might be guilty, anyway.

882
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,200
But if I know all that, then...

883
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:00,570
Why can't I... breathe?

884
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,173
Come here.

885
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,243
All right.

886
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,444
Please...

887
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:10,614
Gibbs, just... fix this.

888
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:13,383
You always fix things.

889
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,819
Please, fix this, too.

890
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,554
I'm trying.

891
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,628
I am trying, Abbs.

892
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,565
(Indistinct background
radio communication)

893
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,333
Tony:
NCIS.

894
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,603
You here for the couple?
Bishop: Couple?

895
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,172
What couple?

896
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,574
Well, figure since you're
Navy agents, you heard.

897
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:39,543
Michael Hayes's parents

898
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:40,544
just came to visit.

899
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:43,413
Mm... his mother
died years ago,

900
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,182
and his father
just passed away.

901
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:46,383
We know.

902
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:47,451
That's why we detained them.

903
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:48,785
Who are they?

904
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,353
Won't talk.

905
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:53,490
Only said they're
on a mission for NCIS.

906
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:54,624
Bring in the couple.

907
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,759
(Over radio): Copy that.
(Sighs)

908
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,160
We searched them.

909
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,129
Lady kind of liked it.

910
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:00,397
Found a weapon.

911
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,531
A weapon?

912
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,333
Scissors--

913
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,134
said they wanted
to give Hayes a haircut.

914
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:06,236
Oh...
(Quiet chuckle)

915
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,571
Like we'd ever
let them near him.

916
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:08,605
(Lock buzzes, latch clicks)

917
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,107
Oh, here they are now.

918
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,544
(Sighs)

919
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,813
So what do you want us
to do with these two?

920
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,525
How could you?

921
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,228
You jeopardized
our entire case.

922
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,663
There are rules for a reason.

923
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,632
A man's life is at stake here,

924
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:39,236
not to mention the career of
a gifted forensic scientist

925
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,404
who's now adrift in
a sea of self doubt.

926
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:42,873
Sorry...
I'm sorry, Donald.

927
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,508
Oh, please.

928
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,710
You should have left them
to rot in jail.

929
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:48,211
Ah, ease up on 'em, duck.

930
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,147
They did the wrong thing
for the right reason.

931
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,882
Well, don't you
go soft on me, now.

932
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:53,683
Hey, just to be clear,

933
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,352
you're yelling at them,

934
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:58,155
and not me, right?

935
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,290
Oh, shut up, Lyle.

936
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,591
(Door closes)

937
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,694
Donald's right,
we overstepped our boundaries.

938
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:06,163
Mm-hmm.

939
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:09,366
So why are you so calm,
agent Gibbs?

940
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:12,402
They got Michael Hayes's DNA.

941
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,937
Ms. Sciuto is, no doubt,

942
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:17,174
running the new DNA test
on it right now.

943
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,943
Walt, I will bet you were
one hell of a detective.

944
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,912
Peanut butter...

945
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,680
Peanut butter.

946
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,183
What?

947
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,553
Sorry.

948
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:32,189
I noticed agents
DiNozzo and McGee

949
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,724
uh, had tree sap
on their shoes,

950
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,259
from their time
in the woods.

951
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,962
Which is pretty
observant of me, right?

952
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:41,248
So, anyway,

953
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,533
i-i researched how to get sap
off of leather,

954
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,936
and... it's peanut butter.

955
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:47,737
It's the creamy kind,
not chunky.

956
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:48,905
(Phone beeps)
Lyle...

957
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:49,973
I know.

958
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,692
Shut up?

959
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:53,410
(Phone beeps)
No. You just solved a murder.

960
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:54,744
Hey, DiNozzo,

961
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,379
I need your finger.
Where are you?

962
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,583
Did he just say
you solved a murder?

963
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:03,286
Abbs.
Gibbs.

964
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:04,454
It's not a match.
I know.

965
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:06,289
(Sighs heavily)

966
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,959
This is a perfectly
accurate DNA test.

967
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,894
There's no way
it can be wrong.

968
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,796
It's not a match
to the original hair.

969
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,664
I know, I know.
Michael Hayes is innocent.

970
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,216
What are we gonna do?

971
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:17,767
I need you to focus.
We're gonna catch a killer.

972
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,003
How?
If I give you
a sample of sawdust,

973
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:22,272
could you match it
to a type of tree?

974
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,273
Oh, yeah.

975
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:24,808
I can do better than that.

976
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,342
I can tell you the exact
tree that it came from.

977
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,345
How?

978
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,346
DNA, Gibbs, it's in
every living thing.

979
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,348
(Computer blipping)

980
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,683
Actually, DNA from a tree

981
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,518
is very similar to human DNA.

982
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,987
Good! That's great,
Abbs, great.

983
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:39,689
Well, but I mean,
to get a match

984
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,675
I would need
the sawdust,

985
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,660
and I'd need a sample from
the tree that it came from.

986
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,362
Uh... be back in five minutes.

987
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:50,667
Boss cut me.

988
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:52,269
Head slaps are one thing, but...

989
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,371
Don't you think I've
suffered enough, bishop?

990
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,039
You know what, bishop?

991
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,674
You're the only one
that can fix this.

992
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:58,675
Yeah...

993
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:00,443
Okay.

994
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,715
Attention, squad room.

995
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:06,916
Louder!
Louder!

996
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:10,020
(Loudly):
Attention, squad room!

997
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,723
I, Eleanor bishop,

998
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,926
am asking the spirits
of criminal science

999
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,329
for a really hectic day.

1000
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:20,897
A-a crazy day, where

1001
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:24,401
lots of things go terribly,

1002
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:26,403
terribly wrong.

1003
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:27,437
There you go.

1004
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,406
Thank you.

1005
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,474
(Elevator bell dings)

1006
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:33,710
Never know, it might work.

1007
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:34,944
(Whispering):
Here comes our guy.

1008
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,446
Thanks.

1009
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:38,581
Jason:
Excuse me.

1010
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,083
Agent Gibbs asked me
to come in.

1011
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,051
Ah, yes, Mr. tupperman.

1012
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:42,385
He's expecting you.

1013
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,420
Hi, Jason. How are you?

1014
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:44,754
Oh.

1015
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,456
Would you like
a glass of water?

1016
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,857
Thank you.

1017
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,930
Perfect. Thank you.

1018
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,765
McGee: I noticed,
coming in this morning--

1019
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,600
it's pretty crowded out there.

1020
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:59,436
Did you find parking okay?

1021
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:00,470
Sure, yeah.

1022
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,505
No, I just used your valet.

1023
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,875
What is this?

1024
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:07,410
Hey, tupperman...

1025
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:11,414
...there is no valet.

1026
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:20,123
<i> Jason (Recorded): When they</i>
<i> arrested Michael, on the ship,</i>

1027
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:23,426
<i> in 1999, I wanted to confess</i>
<i> there and then.</i>

1028
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,730
And every day, I woke up,
i told myself

1029
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,131
I was gonna
tell the truth, but...

1030
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:31,801
I don't know, I just...
I couldn't do it.

1031
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:35,472
I do not regret killing
lieutenant swannie.

1032
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:39,442
But I do regret allowing my
best friend to take the fall.

1033
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:43,513
For 16 years, Michael and i
lived the wrong lives.

1034
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,465
(Recorder beeps off)

1035
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,416
So how did Gibbs come
to suspect tupperman?

1036
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:49,119
Tree sap.

1037
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,954
Yeah, when Gibbs noticed

1038
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,622
the dark stains
on tupperman's shoes,

1039
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,858
he didn't think
anything about it

1040
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,860
until Lyle, here,

1041
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:59,028
saw the same stains...

1042
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,598
On the shoes of agents
McGee and DiNozzo.

1043
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,400
It's circumstantial.

1044
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:07,904
Yes, until Ms. Sciuto
matched the sawdust

1045
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,440
in the teeth of
tupperman's car keys

1046
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,008
with the splinter...

1047
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,711
In agent DiNozzo's finger.

1048
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:17,514
DNA proved that they both came

1049
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,616
from the same
white eastern pine

1050
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:23,553
that stood directly behind
where the commander was shot.

1051
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:25,722
The witness tree...

1052
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:27,991
Did, in fact, testify.

1053
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:30,827
And fireman Bennett
had nothing to do with it?

1054
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,763
Oh, once a scapegoat,
always a scapegoat.

1055
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,502
Where's my Gibbs?

1056
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,504
He sends his regrets.

1057
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:42,505
Oh.

1058
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:43,873
Oh, it's fine.

1059
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,175
I'll be seeing
lots of him, anyway.

1060
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:48,545
Agent McGee and i
are collaborating

1061
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,046
on a new crime novel,

1062
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:51,714
and I'm basing
my main character

1063
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:55,752
on a silver-haired devil
short on words,

1064
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,555
but his eyes say plenty.

1065
00:40:58,557 --> 00:40:59,622
(Chuckling)

1066
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,857
Heavens.

1067
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,892
Please, keep me out of it.

1068
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,794
Of course.

1069
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,630
And, uh...
Please accept my resignation.

1070
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,566
Donald! No!

1071
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,100
I'm sorry, Walter,

1072
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,869
the-the-the conflict
of interest

1073
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:14,504
weighs too heavily on me.

1074
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:15,905
I've made up my mind.

1075
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:19,476
But i-i understand,
from the house rules,

1076
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:20,977
I can name an apt replacement?

1077
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,712
Is that true?

1078
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,248
My house, my rules.

1079
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,934
Ducky:
So...

1080
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:30,619
I would like to pass
the magnifying glass to someone

1081
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:34,657
who I know shares
your unique enthusiasm.

1082
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:36,960
(Knocking "shave and a haircut")

An allergic reaction

Clear your racks,
