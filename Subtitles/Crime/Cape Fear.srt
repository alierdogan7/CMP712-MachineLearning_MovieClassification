00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,388
I always thought that
for such a lovely river,

3
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,958
the name was mystifying:
"Cape Fear."

4
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:54,063
When the only thing to fear on
those enchanted summer nights...

5
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,574
was that
the magic would end,

6
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,510
and real life
would come crashing in.

No, no.

Yeah, like an arrow.

'Cause you've

Is marriage synonymous

No, no, no.

which is a kind
of reminiscence,

and we have to attempt
something in the same style.

143
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,124
What's it about,
your reminiscence?

144
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,167

You know, the alternative
was to expel her.

from the college...

156
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,765

You and I smoked
dope in our time.

162
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:06,045
In some cultures,

00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,916
<i>Leave the light off.</i>
<i>Leave it off.</i>

172
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,054
I saw him when the
fireworks went off.

173
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,284
[Whispering]
What?

174
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,918
I think I talked to him
this afternoon.
You know him?

175
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,995
I want you the hell
off my property!

176
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,909
He's gone.

177
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,412
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>He said, "I'm gonna make</i>
<i>you think about loss, "</i>

178
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,650
or "I'm gonna make you
learn about loss."

179
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,420
Something like that.

180
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,926
That's very poetic.

181
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,930
Who is he, and where
did he come from?
<i>He's from...</i>

182
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,263
Leigh, get the dog off.
Ben, get down.

183
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,769
<i>He doesn't</i>
<i>mind me at all.</i>

184
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,169
<i>It's your dog.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

185
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,730
He shouldn't be up
on the table.

186
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,778
<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>dog hairs in your tea.</i>
Get down.

187
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:23,975
<i>Where's he from?</i>
He's from the hills,
Pentecostal crackers.

188
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,143
What was he
in prison for?

189
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:32,020
I think it was battery.
<i>You think it</i>
<i>was battery?</i>

190
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,994
Did he batter a man?
Did he batter a woman?
<i>I don't know.</i>

191
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,896
It was 14 years ago.
You know, it's kinda...

192
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,662
<i>I really</i>
<i>don't remember.</i>

193
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,000
What does he
want with you?

194
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,632
<i>He's just tryin'to bug us.</i>
<i>Just messin'around.</i>

195
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,575
He's an ex-con,
so he's just...

196
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:57,240
You know, he's probably
upset at the lawyer.

197
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,444
Yeah, your clientele.
<i>Yeah.</i>

198
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,550
<i>Bye, Dad.</i>
Bye, Danny.

199
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,855
<i>You look tired.</i>
Thanks.
I needed that.

200
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,360
I don't want
to alarm her,

201
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,863
but I'd rather Danny
didn't wander alone...

202
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,161
on her soul-searching
walks in the woods,

203
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,429
at least till I've
started a few things.

204
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,495
What if she takes
Benjamin with her?
Ben, our guard dog?

205
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,437
What's he gonna do,
lick him to death?

206
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,909
<i>Just tell her.</i>
<i>I hardly know anything</i>
<i>about the man.</i>

207
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,640
I don't mean his biography,
just there's some creep around.

208
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,740
If you see him again,
call the cops and
then call me.

209
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,842
What about a weapon?

210
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,548
In case things get
exciting around here.

211
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,956
Would you feel more secure with
a loaded gun in the house?

212
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,518
We'd end up using it
on each other.
Or Danny would.

213
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,793
He's not gonna do anything.
He just got out of prison.

214
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,697
<i>He doesn't want</i>
<i>to go right back.</i>

215
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,265
Call Lee Heller.
Lee's a colorful character,

216
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,468
but he's still the best
criminal lawyer in the state.

217
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,670
Good.
<i>Get me Lee Heller.</i>

218
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,545
You defended this guy,
right?
<i>Right.</i>

219
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,550
So what makes you think
he wants to harm you?

220
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,279
Yesterday I was
getting in my car.

221
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,914
The guy comes up.
We have a conversation.

222
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,015
He says to me,
"You're gonna learn about loss."

223
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,462
That'd hardly qualify under
the terrorist threat statutes.

224
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,363
Come on, Tom!
The guy's an ex-con!

225
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,368
You know as well as I do
what that means.

226
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,303
Last night, there he was
behind our house.

227
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,341
- Attempted b and E.
- No, not exactly.

228
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,867
He was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property.

229
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,744
<i>That's not even</i>
<i>trespassing, Sam.</i>

230
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,216
What can I say?
Get a restraining order.

231
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,652
I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in ten days.

232
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:47,021
<i>Good.</i>
<i>Anything I can do.</i>

233
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,255
Tom, 14 years ago...

234
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,422
in this case,

235
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,729
I had a report
on a victim.
<i>It was a rape case.</i>

236
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,599
That's right, rape and
aggravated sexual battery.

237
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,298
I had a report
on this victim,

238
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:05,673
and it came back that
she was promiscuous.

239
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:09,475
And, uh...
I buried it.

240
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,447
Whew.

241
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,487
<i>Anybody else</i>
<i>know?</i>
No, I buried it.

242
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,649
I didn't show it to the client,
to the prosecution.

243
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,126
But if you had seen
what this guy had
done to this girl...

244
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,561
"In every criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have...

245
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,067
the assistance of counsel
for his defense."
<i>I know the 6th Amendment,</i>

246
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,999
but I believe in
the 6th Amendment.

247
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,128
That's why I left
the public defender's office.

248
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,142
Some folks just don't have
the right to the best defense?

249
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,678
<i>Of course they deserve</i>
<i>the best defense!</i>

250
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,182
But if you had seen what
he did to this girl...
<i>Buried the report.</i>

251
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,308
If it was your
own daughter, Tom...

252
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,786
Buried the report.

253
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,415
Jesus, Sam.

254
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,289
Oh, God.

255
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,098
But I don't see
how he could know that.

256
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,100
He was illiterate.

257
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,001
I had to read everything to him:
The probable cause affidavit,

258
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:10,064
the arrest reports,
everything.

259
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,940
There's no way
he could know that.

260
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:28,416
Danny, it's so quiet out here
and the light's so perfect.

261
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:32,862
Why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?
<i>Why?</i>

262
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,922
I told you why.

263
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,232
Well, is it because
he's like a flasher
or just a peeper?

264
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,535
What do you know about that?
A flasher?

265
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,406
You don't think I've
been flashed before?

266
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,106
I didn't mean to insult you.
I'm sure you've been flashed.

267
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,116
If you want to come out,
come on out.

268
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,119
Do whatever you want.

269
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,951
Oh, but don't
go outside.

270
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,894
<i>Afternoon,</i>
<i>Counselor.</i>

271
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,702
What do you want,
Mr. Cady?

272
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,732
<i>[Cady]</i>
<i>Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm!</i>

273
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,540
They're great at that age,
ain't they?

274
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,548
All those discoveries
ahead of them.

275
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,811
You're lucky,
Counselor.

276
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,149
My own daughter,
she don't even know me.

277
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:32,088
After I went inside,
her mama told her I was dead.

278
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,091
Which,
in a way, I was.

279
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,960
Look, Mr. Cady,
I realize that you suffered.

280
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:43,365
I understand your problem,
but I mean, why me?

281
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,131
I was your lawyer.
I defended you.

282
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,537
Why not badger the D.A.
Or the judge?

283
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,008
"Badger"?
Why not them?

284
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,513
Badger.
Why not?

285
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,038
Best I remember, they was just
doin' right by their jobs.

286
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:02,314
I didn't do my job?
Is that right?

287
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,254
I pleaded you out to
a lesser included offense.

288
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,758
You could've gotten rape
instead of battery.

289
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:12,525
I'd have been up for parole
either way in seven years.
<i>Rape is a capital offense.</i>

290
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,122
You could've gotten life.
You could've done death.

291
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,192
You could be sittin' on
death row right now.

292
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,907
I learned to read
durin' my stretch.

293
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,603
First,
<i>Spot Goes to The Farm,</i>

294
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:32,048
then <i>Runaway Bunny,</i>
then law books, mostly.

295
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,176
Did you know that after
I discharged you,

296
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,345
I acted as my
own attorney?

297
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,651
Applied several times
for an appeal.

298
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,659
No, I didn't
know that.

299
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,319
Mm-hmm.

300
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,523
So, here we are...
two lawyers,

301
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,658
for all practical purposes,
talkin' shop.

302
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,227
How much do you want,
Mr. Cady?

303
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:57,298
How much do I want what?
How much money
do you want?

304
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,005
Money? Counselor,
do I look destitute to you?

305
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,243
I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.

306
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,252
You ever been a woman?

307
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,778
A what?
A woman.

308
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:16,658
Some fat, hairy,
ugly hillbilly's wet dream.

309
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,762
I realize that you suffered.
There's no question about that.

310
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,271
You don't know what
sufferin' is, Counselor.

311
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,899
Like it says
in Galatians 3:

312
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:34,878
"Have ye suffered
so many things in vain?"

313
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,675
I learned from the get-go
in the joint...

314
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:41,618
to get in touch with the
soft side of myself,
the feminine side.

315
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,658
Well, I'm open to some
sort of discussion...

316
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,695
on compensation.

317
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,129
What shall be my
compensation, sir,

318
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,532
for being held down and
sodomized by four white guys?

319
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,594
Or four black guys?

320
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,833
Shall my compensation
be the same?

321
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:06,309
What is the formula
for compensation, sir?

322
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:10,337
How about
$ 10,000 in cash?

323
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,048
Do l...

324
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,720
Let's just
break that down.

325
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,226
That figure just came
to the top of my head.
Let's break it down.

326
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:26,560
For argument's sake,
let's say $20,000, $30,000.

327
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,361
I'll tell you what,
let's say $50,000.

328
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,801
$50,000 into 14 years.

329
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,704
Fourteen years
times 365 days...

330
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,709
I'd say is about
5,000 days.

331
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:43,407
You divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $ 10 a day.

332
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,144
That's not even
minimum wage!

333
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,552
To say nothing about the family
that I lost, the respect.

334
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,852
I don't think you really,
really understand...

335
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,119
what we're talkin'
about here.

336
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,127
Fourteen years.

337
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,856
<i>[Beeping]</i>

338
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,057
Whoops!
Uh-oh!

339
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,862
Gotta git. I'm late
for another appointment.

340
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,409
Sam, my man,
I got some good news.

341
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,740
I got the bank,
the account number.

342
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,042
I'll call your
son-in-law's lawyer.

343
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,446
<i>Mr. Bowden?</i>
<i>Your wife's on line one.</i>

344
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,644
Ask her to hold.
I gotta make a call.

345
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,983
I wouldn't make that call.
The way I'd handle...

346
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,988
<i>Mr. Bowden,</i>
<i>she says it's urgent.</i>

347
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,461
Yeah?

348
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,966
<i>[Leigh]</i>
<i>These kind of horrible,</i>
<i>high-pitched howls.</i>

349
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,094
They sounded like
he was screaming.

350
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,368
And then Danny came
running in, and...

351
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,968
I called the vet.

352
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,503
And then it was
so weird, because...

353
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:55,947
it was like he was
winding down,

354
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,923
just winding down
like an old clock.

355
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,858
And then all of a sudden
he just stopped.

356
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,123
He had this kind of...

357
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,861
his eyes just wide open,
and this kind of...

358
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,436
surprised look.

359
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,899
<i>And then...</i>

360
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:25,275
And then he died.

361
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,980
He just died, before
the vet even got here.

362
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,751
What'd the vet say?

363
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,657
That he was poisoned.
<i>Poisoned?</i>

364
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,661
What kind of a poison?

365
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:41,631
I don't know
what kind of poison.
<i>Jesus, Leigh!</i>

366
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,691
I told you not
to let him out!

367
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,033
- I didn't let him out!
- Then how?

368
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,630
<i>[Door Slams]</i>

369
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,200
I've got an English Setter,
so I don't cotton
to dog killers.

370
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,543
Trouble is, poisoning
a dog is just a fine.

371
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,742
But if he's unemployed,

372
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,809
he's gotta have money
or we'll bust him for vagrancy.

373
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,253
We'll give him
a full-body strip search.

374
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,383
Jerk a knot
in his tail.

375
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,519
All right.

376
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:15,259
<i>[Lieutenant]</i>
<i>We got so many ways on the books</i>
<i>to lean on an undesirable.</i>

377
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,860
<i>He'll feel about as</i>
<i>welcome around here as</i>
<i>a case of yellow fever.</i>

378
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:22,805
<i>- Hands against the wall.</i>
<i>- Spread 'em!</i>

379
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,934
That him?
One-way mirror.

380
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,469
He doesn't know
you're here.
Yeah, that's him.

381
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,038
Get the shirt off.

382
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,142
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>hurry up.</i>

383
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,655
<i>Just pass it</i>
<i>over to him.</i>

384
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,883
<i>Hand it to me.</i>

385
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,688
<i>Knock off</i>
<i>the shoes.</i>

386
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,628
<i>Hand 'em to</i>
<i>the other officer.</i>

387
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,859
<i>Pass 'em to him.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

388
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,663
<i>Let's put the arms out.</i>
<i>Put the arms out straight.</i>

389
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,236
<i>- Roll your palms.</i>
<i>- Do what he says.</i>

390
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,848
<i>Turn around, slow.</i>

391
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,618
Sheesh.

392
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,354
I don't know whether
to look at him or read him.

393
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,265
<i>Stand still.</i>

394
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,603
<i>One more step for you.</i>
<i>You know the routine.</i>

395
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,407
<i>Against the wall.</i>

396
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,877
We searched his apartment.
His car registration,
everything's in order.

397
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:38,848
<i>There's no guns or any weapons,</i>
<i>but we found these.</i>

398
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,678
<i>Cady's</i>
<i>savings account.</i>

399
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,156
<i>$30,000?</i>

400
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,058
His mother died,
the farm got sold.
He got the proceeds.

401
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,222
Well, he's got money.
Where does that leave us?

402
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,131
<i>We nail him for the dog.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

403
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,136
You let the dog out.
Cady abducted him.

404
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,401
No, uh...
we didn't let the dog out.

405
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,635
Cady came
into your house?

406
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,405
That's illegal entry
with intent!
No, no, no.

407
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,209
But he didn't come
into the house.

408
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:14,445
I don't know exactly
how he did it,

409
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,181
I just know
that he did it.

410
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,018
That's not good enough,
Mr. Bowden.

411
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,650
You're a lawyer.
You damn-well know that.

412
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,627
<i>Get off the pants.</i>

413
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:33,503
He's gonna screw up.
The Sheriff assured me
that they always do.

414
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,335
He's gonna get
the message in
no uncertain terms.

415
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,375
I'd still like
to kill him.

416
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:45,682
## [Drum And Fife]

00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,963
<i>[Leigh]</i>
<i>Danny, how come you</i>
<i>didn't join up with them?</i>

418
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,560
You can tap.
You can do that.

419
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,264
You can tap.
Dance.

420
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,503
I wanted to once,
but I don't know.

421
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,877
Son-of-a-bitch!
What?

422
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:31,558
He's staring at you.
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

423
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,626
What the hell
are you doin'?

424
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,070
Mmm, hot as a firecracker
on the 4th of July.

425
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,041
<i>You're damn lucky</i>
<i>to have her, boy.</i>

426
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,599
Son-of-a-bitch!

427
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,910
- Where the hell did he go?
- Son-of-a-bitch!

428
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,345
Watch my arm.
It might be broke.

429
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,914
What's with you, buddy?
You have no right to be
pushin' me around.

430
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,517
I was just watchin'
the parade.

431
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,497
Son-of-a-bitch!
<i>What are you gettin'</i>
<i>so upset about?</i>

432
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,056
You're lucky
I don't sue you.

433
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,897
All right,
all right!

434
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,904
<i>Settle down!</i>

435
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,566
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>I'm settled down.</i>

436
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,439
Sam, what are
you doing?
It's nothing.

437
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,707
Who was that?
Let's go.

438
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,079
<i>The fellow with the tie.</i>
<i>His wife took him away.</i>

439
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,675
<i>I think he really</i>
<i>hurt his arm.</i>

440
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,687
Mom.

441
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,618
<i>That's a strong drink</i>
<i>you've got there.</i>
<i>You said it.</i>

442
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:39,595
Just put a goldfish in it
and you'll be fine.

443
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,824
You seem to be having
a good time.

444
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,065
I've been
practicing.
<i>Practicing for what?</i>

445
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,073
<i>How to fall on</i>
<i>the floor?</i>
A life of debauchery.

446
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,472
Debauch...

447
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:55,069
Debauchery.
It's a three-syllable word.

448
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:59,845
Making fun of me?
That's okay, no problem.

449
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,716
I made you blush.
Blush?

450
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:06,416
You're now the color
of your shirt: Scarlet.

451
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,025
I had no business
getting stuck on a
guy who was married.

452
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,997
You certainly did not.
I don't know
what I was thinking.

453
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,193
God only knows.

454
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,702
Aren't I the bozo
on this bus?

455
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:24,174
Lest you think that I slept
with this particular...

456
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,472
That's your business.
That's not mine.

457
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,171
I don't want it to sound
like I've been through...

458
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,704
<i>a bus load of'em.</i>
That's the way
it sounded to me.

459
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,649
He was the first.
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

460
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,347
He was, I swear.

461
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,323
Tell it to
the judge.

462
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,488
Actually, the rat
stood me up today.
<i>Did he?</i>

463
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,727
What a shame.
I know.

464
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,929
Now it's my turn.
Where are you from?
Where am I from?

465
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,995
You're gonna love this.

466
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:59,237
I'm from, uh... Georgia State
Correctional Facility.

467
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:09,742
<i>You think I'm jokin'.</i>
<i>I just got released from prison.</i>

468
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,254
Oh, my God.

469
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,916
This is the way my day's
been turning out.

470
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,086
<i>Actually, it reminds</i>
<i>me of a joke.</i>

471
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,322
Do you want
to hear it?
<i>Tell me.</i>

472
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,887
Liven up the night.

473
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:25,026
An unmarried woman, uh...
wait, that's not it.

474
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,004
Get the joke straight,
darlin'.
Shut up!

475
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,132
An unmarried woman,
she meets a guy,

476
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,803
and he tells her he just
got out of prison.

477
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,312
"What'd you do?"
She asks.

478
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:40,442
"I hacked my wife into 52
pieces with a chain saw."

479
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,579
She says... She says,
"So, you're single?"

480
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,987
That's even
funnier!
Thank you.

481
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:51,154
Could I ask you something?
What did you do?
<i>I knew you were gonna ask.</i>

482
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,561
I hacked my wife
into 52 pieces.

483
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,861
I was afraid you were
gonna say that.

484
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,130
I'm a very small person,
so maybe...

485
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,195
Well, maybe I can hack you
into 40 pieces.

486
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,807
What did you do,
really?

487
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,781
No, really,
but what did you do?

488
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,945
There was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant.

489
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,716
And so when they came
to arrest us,

490
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,920
this macho sheriff got rough
with the lady behind me,
so I popped the bastard.

491
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,428
So they gave me
a little time for it.

492
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,794
I'm drinking
a Sea Breeze.

493
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:30,356
I hope you can
afford them.
You gotta stay sober.

494
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,734
If you ain't sober,
you're takin' your chances.

495
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,273
'Cause I'm just

00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:15,344
<i>I'm so sorry</i>
<i>about this.</i>
I feel the same way.

662
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,282
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>Well, are you really</i>
<i>determined about...</i>

663
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,290
<i>movin'back</i>
<i>to Connecticut?</i>

664
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,622
<i>[Lori]</i>
<i>I've thought</i>
<i>about it a lot.</i>

665
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,787
<i>I think it's probably</i>
<i>the best thing.</i>

666
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,798
<i>I thought that maybe</i>
<i>I could go back to school.</i>

667
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:33,769
<i>I'm really gonna</i>
<i>miss you, though.</i>
Excuse me, Lori.

668
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,362
That sounds
real good.
<i>Yeah?</i>

669
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,704
That's gonna work out fine.
I'll get back to ya.

670
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,710
All right, bye.

671
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:48,111
Well, I just don't know
what I hate more,

672
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,018
that insipid tone
or your stupid,

673
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,648
sophomoric
infidelities.

674
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:57,660
Who was that, huh?
The girl that got beat up?

675
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,162
Yes, Lori Davis.
I already told you.

676
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,596
She works at
the County Courthouse.

677
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,430
And what?
You're fucking her?

678
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,764
Oh, no.

679
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,637
Interesting choice, Sam.
Calling from our bedroom phone.

680
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,938
<i>Why is it</i>
<i>that whenever...</i>

681
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,478
I have a private
phone conversation,

682
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,413
you assume that I'm
fucking someone?

683
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,950
That's why that psychopath
chose her, right?

684
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,248
<i>Yes, that's why</i>
<i>he chose her.</i>

685
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,450
But I'm not fucking
her in any way.
Uh-huh.

686
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,459
You sleazy
son-of-a-bitch!

687
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,620
You son-of-a-bitch!
Damn it!

688
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:35,290
You son-of-a-bitch!
Stop it!
Leigh!

689
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,697
<i>Danny's right</i>
<i>downstairs.</i>

690
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:41,465
Oh, honey,
there's nothing the matter.

691
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,701
Yeah, I can see, Dad.

692
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,300
<i>You promised to leave</i>
<i>that shit in Atlanta.</i>

693
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,777
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>What shit?</i>

694
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:53,613
##

695
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,881
<i>[Leigh]</i>
<i>Christ, what a waste.</i>

696
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,855
The humiliation we went through
confessing our dirty secrets...

697
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,289
in those horrible sessions
with Dr. Hackett.

698
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,795
We talked that one damn
incident to death.
<i>Why did you bother?</i>

699
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:10,027
<i>Because you asked me...</i>
I mean, why did you bother?
Why did you bother!

700
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,625
Why did you bother
with you and me?

701
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,365
With the marriage?

702
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,306
Uprooting me and Danny,
moving?

703
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,742
That's what we decided to do!
You said you wanted to get out!

704
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,508
You don't get it.
What is it
I don't get?

705
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:28,381
<i>- What don't I get?</i>
<i>- Why put us through that!</i>

706
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,186
Nadine?
It's Danny.

707
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,955
Nothing.

708
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:40,656
I'm just losing
my mind here.

709
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,790
You don't have the balls
to walk out,

710
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,834
if that's what
you wanted.

711
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,837
Like I was gonna split
with you acting the way you act.

712
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,373
Acting?
You did some acting.

713
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,271
I don't remember
doing any acting.

714
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,277
You don't remember?
Let me refresh your memory.

715
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:59,907
Do you remember not
taking any work?
Not fixing any meals?

716
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,451
I'm not on
fucking trial here!

717
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,181
Do you remember crying
every morning and evening?

718
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,382
Do you remember that?

719
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,558
I scared you, huh?

720
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,359
What did
you think, Sam?

721
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,060
You thought maybe
I was gonna kill myself?

722
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,399
<i>Over you?</i>
Well, who else?

723
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,062
You pompous ass!

724
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,630
You wouldn't leave
the bedroom!

725
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,903
I wish you could
say the same.

726
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,411
<i>Isn't this what</i>
<i>Dr. Hackett talked about?</i>

727
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:32,448
Diggin' up the past.

728
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,009
The relevant issue is whether
I've been messin' around,

729
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,146
and I have not been.

730
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:42,249
<i>As far as this girl goes,</i>
<i>she's just a kid.</i>

731
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,351
That shouldn't
stop you.

732
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:48,194
She's a baby!
You gravitate to people
in the same profession.

733
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,857
You gravitate to women.

734
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,868
I'm a lawyer, she's a clerk.
She looks up to me!

735
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,770
She's just infatuated.
I can't help that!

736
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,305
Look, Leigh.
I'm scared.

737
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,815
This whole
thing has...

738
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:12,646
I keep feeling that there's some
animal out there, stalking us.

739
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,716
I think he wants to
hurt us in the worst way.

740
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:20,229
And that's got me
frightened to death.

741
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,729
You really are scared,
aren't you?
Oh, yeah.

742
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:30,170
Somebody finally
got to you.

743
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,673
Look, Leigh,

744
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,939
I think that this guy
beat and raped her...

745
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,038
because he knew that
she wouldn't testify,

746
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,606
that she wouldn't
press charges.

747
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,879
Because she knows
the system.

748
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,353
I mean,
she works in it.

749
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,721
She knows
that she'd be on trial.

750
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,226
And then, because she
wouldn't testify,

751
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:55,163
you would assume that there was
something going on between us...

752
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:59,293
and it would
cause a rift.

753
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:04,633
And that we'd be much more
vulnerable to him.

754
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:14,206
I'm glad we talked about this,
because we can work together.

755
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,218
We can beat that
son-of-a-bitch,

756
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,983
the two of us, together,
working as a team.

757
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:23,549
Oh, boy!
Jesus.

758
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,822
Oh, yeah,
this is great.

759
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,194
This is somethin' else.

760
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,825
Oh... shit!

761
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,505
<i>And here you go.</i>
I'm sorry.
I haven't ordered yet.

762
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:49,075
That fellow over there
sent this over, paid for.

763
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,212
Which one?
<i>That guy that's</i>
<i>just leaving.</i>

764
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,858
Excuse me.

765
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,418
Hey, Cady!
Come here.

766
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,487
<i>Wait a second.</i>

767
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,227
I've been in a real
bad mood lately.

768
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,236
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?

769
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:10,501
- No.
- Get the hell outta here.

770
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:14,135
<i>I don't mean this town.</i>
<i>I mean the whole state.</i>

771
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:18,113
<i>I don't wanna see ya, hear ya,</i>
<i>and i don't wanna smell ya.</i>

772
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,274
Are you my friend?

773
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,375
No, I'm not
your friend.

774
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,386
I thought maybe
you were my friend,

775
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,979
because I like to plan my
comin's and goin's with friends.

776
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,992
But if you're not my friend,
I'd call that presumptuous.

777
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,190
I'd call it downright rude,
'cause I ain't your porch-baby.

778
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,697
Well, gee-golly-gosh.

779
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,929
I sure am sorry I offended you,
you white-trash piece of shit.

780
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,766
Ooh, I got the all-over
fidgets on that one!

781
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:44,636
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shiverin' all over.

782
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:49,611
<i>It's not necessary to lay</i>
<i>a foul tongue on me, my friend.</i>

783
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,615
I could get upset.
Things could get outta hand.

784
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,651
And then
in self-defense,

785
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,449
I could do somethin' to you
that you would not like.

786
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,547
You feel squirrelly.
You just jump.

787
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,422
You threatenin' me?

788
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:06,428
- You threatenin' me?
- You catch on fast.

789
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,329
'Cause I'm well within
my rights to be here.

790
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,833
And if I stay here,
what you gonna do?

791
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,336
I don't give a rat's ass
about your rights.

792
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,429
You watch your step.

793
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,371
What you gonna do,
arrest me?

794
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:22,037
You a cop, or were
you not good enough
to remain on the force?

795
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,512
That's the feelin'
I'm gettin' here.

796
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,412
Hope you enjoyed
your breakfast.

797
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:39,259
Ma'am,
this belong to you?

798
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:43,197
<i>Can I help you?</i>
<i>I just found it.</i>
<i>Thought you might need it back.</i>

799
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:47,930
If a dogcatcher comes across
a dog without a license,

800
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,370
he's liable to think
it's a stray...

801
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,670
<i>and do</i>
<i>God-knows-what to it.</i>

802
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,267
You know, um...

803
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,745
Our dog is...
He passed away.

804
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,044
<i>What a shame.</i>
Yeah.

805
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,677
A man's best friend.
A woman's, too.

806
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:06,620
<i>Even without closin'my eyes,</i>
<i>I can picture him...</i>

807
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,683
Big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet.

808
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,752
Keepin' you company while
you're tryin' to finish up...

809
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,298
those pesky,
little sketches.

810
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,531
Oh, you're Max Cady,
aren't you?

811
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:26,773
<i>Get the hell outta here</i>
<i>before I call the police!</i>

812
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,038
<i>I'm not doin'nothin'.</i>

813
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,774
I'm just givin' you back
your dog collar.

814
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,873
You want to
look around?

815
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,214
Go ahead, Mr. Cady,
take a good look.

816
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,254
Nice house.

817
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,290
Yeah, it is a nice house.
You satisfied now?

818
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,658
<i>Or is there more,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

819
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,993
<i>Is that it?</i>

820
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,362
There is gonna be more,
isn't there?

821
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,027
You won't stop
until you're happy.

822
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:56,368
How can I be happy, Leigh,
when you're not happy?

823
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,738
You don't know
anything about me.

824
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,367
I know what I see,
ma'am.
<i>Yeah?</i>

825
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,036
Mm-hmm.

826
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,112
I wanted to know
what you looked like.

827
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,242
I've been waitin'
to see your face,

828
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,981
but now that I see you,
you are just repulsive.

829
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:15,422
<i>I understand.</i>
<i>I'm not your type.</i>

830
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:18,723
No.
<i>All that prison time</i>
<i>made me coarse.</i>

831
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:22,026
Guess I'm covered in
too many tattoos.

832
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,589
There's not a whole
lot to do in prison...

833
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:27,569
but desecrate your flesh.

834
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,037
<i>It didn't have to be that way</i>
<i>for either of us...</i>

835
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,540
<i>if your husband hadn't</i>
<i>betrayed us both.</i>

836
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,510
Who knows? We might've
been different people.

837
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,139
We might've been happy,

838

<i>Yo, Sam!</i>

840
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,730
I thought I'd
catch you here.

841
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:02,795
Well, that little
smart aleck made me.
He what?

842
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,807
It wasn't my fault.
He was lookin' to be covered.

843
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:09,140
There is a lot of cutsie-cutsie
in that little prick.
I told ya.

844
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,804
You know where he was?

845
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,974
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra,

846
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,041
by Friedrich Nietzsche.

847
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,986
He's this German philosopher.
Said that God is dead.

848
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,354
We can keep goin' this way,
but it's gonna get expensive.

849
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:26,919
I'm not so concerned about days.
Stay on him a few more nights.

850
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,761
Do you really want
to resolve this situation?

851
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,269
I'd love to resolve it.
<i>Then I've got</i>
<i>a suggestion.</i>

852
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,998
There's men that can
be hired, by me,

853
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:38,666
to do a little
hospital job on Cady.

854

about here?

855
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,341
Two pieces of pipe,
a bicycle chain.

856
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:51,444
Sam, he won't be
so scary after that.

857
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,716

<i>See the book you have,</i>
<i>Thomas Wolfe?</i>

950
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:14,501
It's all about self-discovery,
the inner voyage.

951
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:18,631

952
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,835
Eugene's journey...

953
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:25,142
It was really, uh,
mystical, you know.

954
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:27,944
And it was almost like
a pilgrimage?

955
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,077
Almost like a cop-out,
if you ask me.

956
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:34,817
Those were the facts
of Wolfe's life.

957
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,826
The novel is what you would call
a "roman a clef."

958
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,863
<i>You know what</i>
<i>that is?</i>

"<i>Plexus, Nexus,</i> and <i>Sexus."</i>

963
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:59,308
No.
<i>You haven't</i>
<i>read that?</i>

964

You're missin'
something.

965
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:07,485
Well, you know what?
I did read <i>Tropic of Cancer.</i>

966
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,583
Just parts of it though,
'cause, uh...

967
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,561
I had to sneak it off
my parents' shelf, you know?

968
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:18,532
But, his descriptions are
pretty vivid, I would say.
<i>Yeah.</i>

969
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:21,365
In one of the novels,
I don't recall which,

970
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:24,372
he describes an erection
as a piece of lead
with wings on it.

971
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,840
I didn't read
that part.

972
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,742
<i>Of course not.</i>
<i>You're not allowed.</i>

973
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,212
Your parents don't want
you to achieve adulthood.
That's natural.

974
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,444
They know the pitfalls
of adulthood, all that freedom.

975
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,611
They know it
only too well.

976
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:41,316
<i>Temptation to stray,</i>
<i>deflecting their guilt</i>
<i>and anger onto you...</i>

not even a crime...

<i>Yeah.</i>

982
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,077
I don't know, but...

983
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,477
If I told you,
you gonna get mad at me?

984
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:07,311
No.

985
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,521
I'm from a black forest.

986
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,459
That's funny.

987
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,761
You're not the
drama teacher, are you?

988
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,495

So, you're that guy that's
been hanging around the house?

991
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:38,380
You're the one that
killed my mom's dog?

992
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:40,847
Your mom's dog was killed?

993
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,544
Yeah.

994
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:45,212
I didn't even know
anything about that.

995
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:48,746
That's a shame.
That's a damn shame.

996
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,521
Yes, it was.

997
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,085
<i>What kind of dog</i>
<i>was it?</i>
Um...

998
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,723
I don't know.
He was just...

999
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,529
He was fluffy and...

1000
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,900
Fluffy?

1001
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:04,769
Mm-hmm.

1002
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,999
So you didn't do that?

1003
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,272
Of course
I didn't do that.
