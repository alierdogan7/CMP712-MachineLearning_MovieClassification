00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,756
Carter, what d'you reckon?
Nice bit of glass, eh?

2
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,552
Yeah, it's a nice ring.

3
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,013
Just don't feel the same way about you,
Miller. Sorry, mate.

4
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,223
Yeah, it's for Sue.
Cost me two months' wages.

5
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,517
I'm gonna pop the question.

6
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:07,479
- Oh, Miller.
- What's up? I thought you'd be happy.

7
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,024
Problem is she's a six out of ten, man.

8
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,859
- Right, Sim?
- Yeah, a six.

9
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,694
Six and a half.
And I'm being generous there, mate.

10
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,778
You what?

11
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,240
If you're gonna tie the knot with someone,
make sure they're a nine or a three.

12
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:21,327
A stunner or a complete shitter.

13
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:26,332
If you fall in the middle you're fucked, mate.
It's never gonna last.

14
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:30,461
- That's bollocks, man.
- I'm talking bollocks, yeah?

15
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,298
All right, we'll ask the others.
Oi, text Clarkey. Ask her.

- Get over to the wall!
- Get on the floor!

Look at that gold!

26
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:29,270
Got a text from Carter.
Wants us to score Miller's girlfriend out of 10.

27
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,562
Don't know. I ain't slept with her.

28
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,773
Oi! It's based on looks.

29
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,942
Four and a half in a balaclava.

30
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,028
- What about you, Lewis?
- Don't know her.

31
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:41,365
What about me, then?
What would you rate me?

32
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:47,121
Well, if it was prick size I'd give you a two,
but since we're talking about faces,

33
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,206
I'll give you a two.

- Average?
- Yep.

39
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:02,970
Not low enough to be grateful to you

40
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,473
and not high enough
to make you grateful to her.

41
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,434
Fucking recipe for disaster.

42
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,853
What about your girl then?
What does she score?

43
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,022

Yeah, nice work, Regan.

62
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,896
But did you really have to
destroy the whole place in the process?

We got the villains, didn't we?

Well, I got the headache of explaining
why you smashed their heads in

65

on our back again.

an armed robbery in progress.

we gotta play the game.

sticking in the back of your nut.

00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,881
It's a private bank, innit? Private security.

173
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,924
And this lot ain't got a license
to carry firearms,

174
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,427
so, what? Pistols and cable ties
would keep them quiet.

175
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,679
Driver out the front,
two to three through the door,

176
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,056
neutralise the desk clerk, dominate the room

177
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,683
and disorientate the security.

178
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,226
You'll need one geezer to hold the floor,

179
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,395
while the other two take the lift
up to the strong room.

180
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,024
But only after collecting all mobiles
and depositing them over there.

181
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,401
Got London Underground
situated conveniently close by.

182
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:06,823
Again, if it all goes tits up out the front,
I'd definitely use that as a possible route.

183
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,453
As for the loot,
I'd settle on any high-denomination bills.

184
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,499
Nice to see you learnt something
in your childhood, George.

185
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,086
Yeah, well, you gotta act like a criminal
to catch one, don't you?

186
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,212
(CHUCKLES)

187
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,257
Officers, Mr. Bledisloe is here to see you.

188
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,802
- I'd much rather talk to you.
- Unlikely.

189
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,387
What about me?

190
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,937
Regan. Flying Squad_

191
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,774
Just a routine check.
What do you actually do here?

192
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,442
I'm the manager.

193
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,986
No, I mean, what does the bank do?

194
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,656
We're a private clearing bank.

195
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:52,702
We hold large amounts of foreign currency
for mostly Middle Eastern clients.

196
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,081
We work with Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Dubai...

197
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,457
How large?

198
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,794
On the right day and the right week,
up to 10 million in cash.

199
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,629
And you ain't got proper security?

200
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,297
- Yes, we do.
- No, you ain't.

201
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,050
They'd shit theirself
with a 9-mil in the back of the canister.

202
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,301
We're not a High Street bank.

203
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,805
If you was, there'd be a blag here every week.

204
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,140
And who's intending to "blag" us?

205
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,102
As I said, this is just a routine check.

206
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:21,314
We tend not to invite police in the bank
too often, it can unnerve the staff.

207
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,066
No one invited us.

208
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,904
Very well, if there's nothing else...

209
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,908
What a cunt!

210
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,576
- I like him.
- You would.

211
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,662
- He's got panache.
- (SCOFFS)

212
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,831
Oi. You want me to stick someone on here
and watch it?

213
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,917
Yeah, Wextru.
He likes sitting on his arse doing nothing.

- Jack.
- Jack.

217
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,693
How's it going, Lewis?

218
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,779
How's life at the sharp end?

219
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:15,160
Must be run off your feet catching all them
criminals from behind the desk.

220
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,914
I don't need to be on the streets
to make arrests, Jack.

221
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,251
There's an abundance of criminals
amongst the police keeping me busy,

222
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,836
you know that.

223
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,964

Grow up, Jack. He's not stupid.

229
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,206
Don't give him a reason to look up your skirt.

230
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,459
As long as he ain't looking up your skirt.

231
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,266
Come on.

You go left and I'll go right.

234
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,989
We wouldn't want anyone to think
we're banging each other, would we?

235
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,870
- Aye, aye.
- ELLIS: All right, guv?

236
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,289
- What you got?
- Sign.

237
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,958
Lovely.

238
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,627
Me and Regan went down to QTZ today.

239
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,295
What's QTZ?

240
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,799
- It's a private bank in Trafalgar Square.
- Never heard of it.

241
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,136
The reason you've never heard about it
before is 'cause it's private.

242
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,387
Funny.

243
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,599
Anyway, Regan wants you to go down there
and put the place under observation.

244
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,476
- Why me?
'WhY "Of you?

245
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,903
Morning, Sweeney.

246
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,700
Good job yesterday. Top drawer.

247
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,578
Got a friend with me here today.

248
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:26,499
I know it's hard enough what we do
without being observed as we do it,

249
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,084
nevertheless,

250
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:32,255
I'd like you to give a warm welcome
to Detective Ivan Lewis from Internals,

251
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,175
who I know some of you already know.

252
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,428
So no larking about.
Give him what he needs, okay?

253
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,430
Thanks, Haskins.

254
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,642
- Jack, nice to see you again.
- How you going?

255
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,771
I'll make this brief.
I'm not here looking for scalps.

256
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,902
All right? I'm not here to shut you down.
I'm just here to observe.

257
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:59,199
Observe how you operate and, if need be,
suggest some adjustments to your approach

258
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,493
and maybe make some recommendations
of how to improve,

259
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,704
enhance the unit's success rate.

260
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,331
Success rate?

261
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:10,543
We've just taken out an armed robbery
with no civilian casualties.

262
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,713
The week before that, a security van attempt.

263
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,340
And all suspects are in custody.

264
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,051
Now, have you got a problem with that?

265
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,345
- No, Jack.
- Good.

266
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:26,184
Oh, and by the way, um,
people who don't know me call me Regan.

267
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,897
(STIFLED LAUGHTER)

268
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,274
The problem...

269
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:38,363
The problem is
the significant number of legal cases

270
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,907
that's mounting against your unit.

271
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,912
And these exclusive
and, frankly, exorbitant Sweeney offices

272
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,998
- funded by the tax payer with...
- it's the tax payer we look after.

273
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,542
It causes resentment
in other departments, you know?

274
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,420
- Oh, fuck!
- The problem is the, er...

275
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:59,092
Methods and tactics you employ.

276
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,053
I mean, there's even talk of baseball bats.

277
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,307
Pick axe handles being used
to attack suspects.

278
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:11,020
The problem is the collateral damage
that's left in your wake...

279
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,440
The problem is people like you
that don't let us do our fucking job.

280
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:17,860
- Easy, Jack.
- Oh, I'm being fucking easy here.

281
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,990
Carter, your lot supposed to be somewhere?

282
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,158
Combat training, sir.

283
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,869
Give me five, will ya?

284
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,416
Don't go too far, George.

285
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,549
So what is it then, Lewis?

286
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,134
What do you want to see?
Your name up in lights,

287
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,428
with a medal pinned on you
for bringing down the Flying Squad?

288
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,138
Regan. Leave it.

289
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,889
Yeah, all right.

290
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,641
What are you like?

291
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,686
You wanna be the little man
that brought down the Sweeney?

292
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,898
Is that it? It's people like you
who want to make us obsolete.

293
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:59,986
'Cause we still do the things
that you can only fucking dream of.

294
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,325
Now, do you wanna take us on?

295
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:09,787
Well, you can have a go.
I mean, other people have had a go.

296
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,789
Have you got big bollocks?

297
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:15,710
Have you? You got big fucking nuts?
Let's have a look at them.

298
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,715
No, I don't think you have.

299
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,431
Tell me something, Lewis.

300
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,685
Is your problem with the job or with me?

301
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,029
The job.

302
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:48,117
It transpires that some of these ingots
went missing from a crime scene.

303
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:53,915
It's also emerged that
everybody but the Sweeney was searched.

304
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,167
So what?

305
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,046

Day in and day out, I'm undermanned,
under-armed and underpaid.

309

I fight crime on the street, not from
behind a fucking desk where I can hide.

310
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:25,530
So do something useful, Lewis,
like catch real fucking criminals.

00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,666

Well, I need something.

- Yeah.

- I'm thinking Italian tonight.

out by Heathrow.

- Yeah.
- it was torched using phosphorus.

332
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,269
It was stolen out of Manchester
about a week ago

333
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,730
and it was reported, and the plates changed.

There's nothing out of the ordinary.

- All right, guv?

Ta.

340
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:11,464

a Smithy or a high-powered Browning.

00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,717
Gonna run a check on the spent cases
now, I'll get back to you ASAP.

342
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,261
But judging by the circumference
of the exit wound,

343
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,597
I'd say they were using dumdums.

344
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,724
- REGAN: They don't mess about, do they?
- Don't fucking mess about.

345
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:25,936
Guv, I found a shaped charge, what's left of it.

346
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,650
Fucking hell, Ellis. You should be
wearing a glove if you're touching that.

347
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,944
What a stain to have on your soul, eh?

348
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:38,199
Take someone's life for a couple of
hundred grand's worth of stones.

349
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,827
I mean, you'd just leave the fucking work
and walk, wouldn't you?

350
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:42,995
Yeah.

351
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,378
Looks like they panicked
when the hold-up alarm went.

352
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,380
Why else would they top her?

353
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,964
Got any ideas?

354
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,135
REGAN: That was blown in 2000.

355
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,304
That was blown the same year.

356
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:02,848
That was blown the following year.

357
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,142
And that was blown today.

358
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,065
What do you notice
about the shaped charges?

359
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,865
- They're all the same.
- Well done, Grasshopper.

360
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,867
Now, see him?

361
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:25,287
I gave him his first two sentences
when he was just a teenager.

362
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,790
He robbed a post office
while he was still at school.

363
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,959
He's a fucking torpedo.

364
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:37,425
Francis Allen. Six years for armed robbery
and attempted murder.

365
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:41,262
Back behind bars
one week after release for another robbery.

366
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,974
Gets parole. After that the trail goes cold.

367
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:49,186
He progressed to, er,
running guns for the Provos.

368
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,896
Earned an absolute fucking fortune

369
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,025
supplying breakaway paramilitary groups,
you know,

370
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,737
with small firearms, light weaponry.

371
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,782
He's got links in Eastern Europe,
Chechnya, Russia, Serbia.

372
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:04,160
By all accounts,
he went to ground in Montenegro.

373
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,662
- So why come back now?
- Don't know.

374
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:11,125
Rob a shitty little low-end jewellers?

375
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,460
Hmm.

376
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,880
He's either done all his beans and gone skint,

377
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:20,176
or an opportunity came his way
and he simplyjust couldn't say no.

378
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,553
Well, let's find him and ask him.

379
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,930
Shake a few trees, see what falls out.

380
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,850
And get Simmonds
to go down Hatton Garden,

381
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,935
see if anyone's tried to fence that bit of tom.

382
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,729
- I'm on it.
- Oi!

383
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,940
I'll pick up the new motor,
flop on a few grasses.

384
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:37,234
Someone's got to know if he's come back.

385
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:38,527
You look excited.

386
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:42,114
Yeah, Francis Allen, guv.
Looks like he's come out of retirement.

387
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,282
I need a word.

388
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,368
- I'm jogging on.
- Regan! I said I need a word.

389
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,537
Now.

390
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,540
Yes, guv.

391
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,545
What's up?

392
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,300
You're playing with a straight bat,
aren't you, Jack?

393
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,468
What?

394
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:06,388
Reassure me that Lewis and his boys
have got nothing on you.

395
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,849
Nothing that can come back and haunt us.

396
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,351
Nothing, no.

397
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:17,066
His team are taking it more seriously
than I anticipated.

398
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,700
- No.
- Good.

399
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:29,787
All right, nail your boy for the robbery.
I'm sure this'll be forgotten about.

400
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,288
- Can I splice now?
- Yeah.

401
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,581
Lovely.

402
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,051
- What do you know about Allen?
- He's a slag.

403
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,555
- You close?
- Nah, I gave him his first bit of porridge.

404
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,933
Thought it would be a matter of time
before I saw his fucking face again.

405
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,687
See, cats like Allen, they can't help theirself.

406
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,438
You look excited.

407
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,275
Sorry, it's your tits.

408
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,611
They don't stick out as much as your belly.

409
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,907
What you saying? I gotta lose a bit of weight?

410
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,952
As long as you don't lose your charm as well.

411
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:18,127
I suppose I could, erm,
lose a couple of kilos for you.

412
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,546
Oh, I'm touched.

413
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,007
- I wish I fucking was.
- You're about to be.

414
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,717
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Here we go.

415
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,886
Oh! Eyes on the road.

416
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,355
- How do you wanna play this?
- Very low key. No trouble.

417
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,649
- Members only.
- Move.

418
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,526
I said, members... (SCREAMS)

419
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,445
We're the Sweeney, son.

420
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,489
Get out of the fucking way
or else I'll break your legs.

421
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,409
Listen up!

422
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,495
Now, calm down, we're not here for drugs.

423
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,124
- What do you want, Regan?
- Not you, you fucking grass.

424
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,503
Fucking hell, Regan. Who dug you up, then?

425
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,591
- What do you want?
- Francis Allen. Where is he?

426
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,345
Leave it out. He ain't been about for years.

427
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,971
You know that.

428
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,016
Well, maybe he just came back.

429
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,602
What do you know about a jewellery robbery?

430
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,021
Innocent girl got one in the back of the nut.

431
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,648
Ring any bells?

432
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,818
Would you like me to jog
your fucking memory?

433
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:28,155
Leave it out, Regan.
You got nish, and you know it.

434
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:31,867
Why don't you take
this fucking little drat and piss off?

435
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,036
Well, I'm gonna enjoy this
a lot more than you are.

436
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,122
Yeah, you think you're gonna enjoy what?
What...

437
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,707
Fucking witch!

438
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,127
(GROANS)

439
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:45,047
Nobody takes liberties on my patch.

440
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:50,177
If I find out you or any one of these slags
know about Allen and his bit of work,

441
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,515
I'll hit you so fucking hard,
you'll wish you were already in prison.

442
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,733
What a fucking world this is.

443
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,237
- What you looking at?
- Hiya.

444
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:16,328
I don't understand. Why would someone
tell you where our man is,

445
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,663
and no one wants to talk to me?

446
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,498
What? Am I losing my touch here?

447
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,751
What can I say? I just come about it
from a different angle than you, that's all.

448
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,837
- You know, ask them nicely.
- REGAN: Oh, <i>fuck!</i>

449
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,755
Anyway, my new mate here...

450
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,881
- You all right, mate?
- Just bring me up.

451
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,967
Just on the phone, one sec.

452
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,512
He reckons our boy Allen's got
a little bolt-hole in the countryside.

453
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,682
Little anonymous gaff
in the middle of nowhere.

454
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,892
I reckon we should get down there, soon as.

455
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,773
<i>REGAN: Report to me anything you see.
Do not come off of Channel 6.</i>

456
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,152
<i>Do not compromise our play.</i>

457
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:53,615
This is Francis Allen we're dealing with.
He's a very capable and dangerous man.

458
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,952
He has killed and he will kill again.

459
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,457
(REGAN SIGHS)

460
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,792
Where the fuck are you?

461
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,926
CARTER: Been here fucking hours.

462
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,767
Do you think he's even in there?

463
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,978
Well, we'll know one way or the other,
won't we?

464
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:27,066
He's really got under your skin,
hasn't he, this one?

465
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,738
I can't have animals running about,
killing innocent girls

466
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,616
and thinking they can get away with it,
George.

467
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,576
Not while I'm Sweeney.

468
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,039
(SIGHS) Fuck me.

469
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,918
Guv, can I ask your advice on something?

470
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,712
Yeah, go on, knock yourself out, Ellis.

471
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:54,259
What would be the best way
of asking Lewis out on a date?

472
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,641
- Lewis?
- Yeah, Nancy.

473
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:06,105
Got a fierce crush on her.
Been thinking about asking her to dinner.

474
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,608
I wouldn't bother if I was you, Ellis.

475
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:13,904
Well, I fancy her loads and it looks like
her marriage is going down the shitter, so...

476
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:18,367
Listen, that's a work colleague of ours
you're talking about here, yeah.

477
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,620
Stop being so unprofessional.

478
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:25,415
Oh, who cares? I'm nuts about her.

479
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,042
Ellis, shut it.

480
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,591
I just really wanna fuck her.

481
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,135
Oh, fucking hell.

482
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,345
And how would you feel
if you ever got the chance, Ellis?

483
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,390
Oh, Jesus. I'd be up on the back of her
like a Jack Russell with two mickeys.

484
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,809
- Oh, nito. Nito!
- (BANGING ON VAN DOOR)

485
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,394
It's Simmonds.

486
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,397
Oi, oi, saveloy!

487
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,399
Where's Wextru?

488
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,192
You sent him to stick a bank
under observation.

489
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,944
Fuck the bank, I want him here.

490
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,155
What about if Allen comes?
I want the whole team here.

491
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:59,825
- George, get on the blower.
- Here, americano, two sugars.

492
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,495
And an organic soya latte for you, guv.

493
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,830
Oh.

494
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:09,042
Soya? Since when did you start
drinking fucking soya?

495
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,003
Oh, fuck me.

496
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,838
She got you on the healthy milk now,
has she?

497
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,715
- Who's that?
- No one.

498
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:18,719
Is it that serious? Is it fucking soya serious?

499
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:22,890
(SIGHS) Well, judge for yourself.
She's coming to dinner.

500
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,020
I will have the prawn cocktail for starters.

501
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:33,859
Then beef lasagne, some chips
and some garlic bread, please. Eating for two.

502
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:38,655
Oh, um, I'll have the deep-fried brie to start

503
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:42,117
and then the um, oh, roast loin of pork

504
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:46,038
and a side of chips.
Can I get some mayonnaise with that as well?

505
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,540
I will have... What's a whitebait?

506
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,877
Them little tiny little fishes
with little miserable looks on their faces...

507
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,087
- Yes, darling.
- ...we had in Greece?

508
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:57,633
I like them. We had them in Greece.
I'll have some of them.

509
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,761
I'll also have rigatoni and meatballs.

510
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,347
Can I have escalope?
Veal escalope on the side.

511
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,098
God, I'm starving.

512
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,771
A bit of garlic bread, I think. Yeah.
What are you having?

513
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:15,984
Um...

514
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,492
I'll have the pear and walnut salad.

515
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,869
All right.

516
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,996
Cheers, mate.

517
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:38,340
- Did you tell Jack yet, darling?
- No.

518
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,802
George has applied for a promotion to DS.

519
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,138
They're hearing it, too.

520
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,015
Marvellous.

521
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,021
How's Neil doing at school, Meg?

522
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,316
Piss off, Jack.

523
00:37:56,984 --> 00:38:00,279
You never asked about him before.
Anyone would think you cared, mate.

524
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,905
Just enquiring.

525
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,783
So George tells me you're married, Nancy?

526
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,619
Yes. But Jack's a better fuck.

527
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,961
That's a good one.

528
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:20,340
I'm only joking. Just that, you know,
I'm in the final stages of a marriage.

529
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:24,594
The only thing keeping us together
is the roof over our heads. So...

530
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:50,203
Fuckin' hell. No danger of you and me
getting it on tonight, is there?

531
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,289
I'm trying here. I'm fucking trying.

532
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,166
You might lose it before you get me into bed.

533
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,169
I've got more chance of losing a stone.

534
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,643
If you was looking at what I was looking at,

535
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:16,271
you'd know why I was so excited.

536
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,580
CARTER: Sure it was Allen?

537
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,042
WEXTRU: Yeah. He pulled up
in a Range Rover and went in with a suitcase.

538
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,294
CARTER: Could be the jewels.

539
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:51,973
Positive ID.

540
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,643
Guess who just woke up.

541
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,066
- We've gotta fucking go now, Carter.
- Wait.

542
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:05,529
Listen, Jack, we're gonna miss the boat
on this one if we don't go now.

543
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,822
Hold up.

544
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,032
Who's this?

545
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:15,163
<i>REGAN: Nobody move.
Unidentified vehicle approaching.</i>

546
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:19,418
Roger that.
We're in position and we're ready to move.

547
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,547
That's gotta be them, innit?

548
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,007
It's the rest of the firm.

549
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,927
Move into position.

550
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,348
<i>Remember, this lot don't mess about,
so hit 'em hard and fast.</i>

551
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,851
<i>Dominate and pacify.</i>

552
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:39,271
I've got a fuckin' hard on, I'm telling you.

553
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:46,361
Simmonds, with me. Ellis, along the wall.
Come on.

554
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,332
Armed police!

555
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,168
Go, go, go, go!

556
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,509
Get up, you...

557
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,764
Ellis, one coming your way!

558
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,226
- Don't fucking move!
- Go, fuck off!

559
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:58,975
Carter, in pursuit of Allen!
Get in the gardening van and cut him off!

560
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,104
Can you hear me? George?

561
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,440
Fuck it!

562
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,707
Oh, fuck!

563
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,432
(CARTER LAUGHING)

564
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,605
Where was you?

565
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,776
- (BUZZING)
- (GROANS)

566
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,528
(CARTER LAUGHING)

567
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,201
Put your trousers on. You're nicked.

568
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,746
I'm gonna rub you right up.
You're gonna get plenty of porridge, son.

569
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,748
Keep fucking moving.

570
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:08,336
Keep your fucking head round that way.

571
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:36,573
- Do you want a cigarette?
- I don't want fucking nothing from you, mate.

572
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:45,123
Look, Freddy, I'm sure your whole life
you've been told not to talk to the police.

573
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:49,502
You live by a code.
Honour amongst thieves and all that.

574
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:52,047
Believe it or not, I respect that.

575
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,884
But, you see,
your code's already been broken.

576
00:43:56,384 --> 00:44:00,138
'Cause armed robbery is one thing
and murder is another.

577
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:05,435
You know, I ain't got a clue
what you're talking about.

578
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,895
I was at a barbecue.

579
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,063
Bang!

580
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,655
I wonder how it would really feel
to be shot in the head. Point blank.

581
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:20,992
One minute
you're going about your business,

582
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:25,455
buying a present for a friend, the next...

583
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,165
- Bang!
- ...nothing.

584
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:31,753
Gone. A full stop on an ordinary life.

585
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,467
A bit funny, innit,
you all meeting round Allen's this morning?

586
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,178
I told you. I was at a barbecue, gavver.

587
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,889
- Bollocks.
- Why don't you check the shopping bags?

588
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,558
You think I carry fucking pork chops around
with me for the fun of it?

589
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,769
Listen to me,
I went round there for a barbecue.

590
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,563
Bollocks.You went round to Allen's house
for your lick of the lolly.

591
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:54,693
I've got a bag full of peppered steaks
and sausages out there. Go and have a look.

592
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,820
What the fuck happened to you, Allen?

593
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,989
I used to think you was a bit of a player
a few years ago.

594
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:04,202
Now you're turning over
two-bob jewellery shops.

595
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,664
And killing punters.

596
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,875
- You the trigger man, then?
- No comment.

597
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,294
You like killing innocent women?

598
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:17,549
She was only buying a present
for a fucking friend, you scum!

599
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:18,800
Twenty-three years old.

600
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:25,223
Shaped charge like that is only available
from an industrial builders' merchants.

601
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,017
Oh, and you need a ticket for that.

602
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:33,481
It's, um, a specialist skill set.

603
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,490
Only someone with a criminal
or military history would be capable.

604
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,743
Oh, and you weren't in the army, was ya,

605
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:48,037
'cause I stuck you in the fucking shovel?
(CHUCKLES)

606
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,917
- Come here.
- What's up, man?

607
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:55,420
You see, Mr. Guilty Murderer,

608
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:58,465
I'm the kind of person, I want to see
those responsible brought to justice,

609
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:01,134
but, you, you're the kind of person,

610
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:05,805
if you had any information on someone
like that, you'd keep it to yourself.

611
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,903
The wrist. May I?

612
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,617
Knock yourself out.

613
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:38,046
Do you know what that is?

614
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,424
It's a watch mark tan line.

615
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,802
Know why?

616
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,850
'Cause I've been in the sun.

617
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,353
So?

618
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,397
So you can sit there
and say anything you want about me

619
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,316
and that bit of work,

620
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,402
you can tell me it's my MO,

621
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,448
how it could have only come from me,

622
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:13,665
fingerprints, DNA, shaped charge.

623
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:14,833
Yeah.

624
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:18,920
There is one fact you're overlooking, Regan.

625
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,255
Oh, what's that?

626
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,882
One piece of undeniable evidence

627
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:26,177
that anyjury in the land
will chuck out of court.

628
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:28,263
Go on.

629
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:31,766
I was on my yacht,

630
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,603
lying in the sun.

631
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,150
You're gonna have to do better than that, son.

632
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:44,904
Why don't you ask your sidekick
to bring my mobile phone in here?

633
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:46,322
Please.

634
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,163
George? Bring this slag's mobile in, will you?

635
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,084
I know it's you.

636
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,670
When I put you away, it will be for so long,

637
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:04,966
next time you come out,
you'll be walking on fucking sticks.

638
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,136
Maybe.

639
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,813
Go on, dig an 'ole for yourself.

640
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:52,180
It's me, on board my yacht.
Moored off the coast of Montenegro.

641
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:04,734
The time and date's at the top of the screen.

642
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,195
Hmm.

643
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:10,198
- But you saw that, didn't you, Regan?
- Yeah.

644
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:18,122
<i>HASKINS: Regan, quick word.</i>

645
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,417
I'll be right there, guv.

646
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,260
Keep your nut on him.

647
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,140
You seem like a smart man, Francis.
You shouldn't underestimate me.

648
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,227
I ain't no one's sidekick.

649
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,357
What you got?

650
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,694
The electronic strip on his passport

651
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:51,489
confirms he was out of the country
at the time of the robbery.

652
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:55,076
He re-entered the night Wextru saw him
with a suitcase.

653
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,914
I think you've got the wrong man.

654
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:03,459
Anyone could have carried his passport.

655
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,462
You know what he's capable of.
It's a move, guv.

656
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,381
It doesn't look like a move from here.

657
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,926
And you know we only have him in custody
for 24 hours.

658
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:15,096
I just need one more little piece
of evidence to tie him to the crime.

659
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,056
Get it quickly, Regan.

660
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,059
You don't charge him by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow,
he's a free man,

661
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:22,770
and you're sitting in a pile of shit.

662
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:47,086
I'm sick of sneaking about in the shadows.

663
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:50,840
I want you to leave him.
I want you to live with me.

664
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:53,509
What? Here in a Holiday Inn?
It's not that easy.

665
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:55,428
I'll get a gaff.

666
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:02,560
We can set up shop together, you and me.
I mean, we're good together.

667
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:07,231
You make me feel, um...

668
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:11,527
Hungry-

669
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,911
Just think about it.

670
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,583
Come, get back into bed, Jack.
You're stressed.

671
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,045
Nah. I've got this slag in a cell.

672
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,131
I know he's fucking playing me.

673
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:35,718
I just can't link him to the crime,
but I know he done it.

674
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:36,928
I know, Jack.

675
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,430
- I just want to put him away.

That's why it was so easy to find him.
