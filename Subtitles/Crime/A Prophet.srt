1
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,667
<i>Take these handcuffs off!</i>

2
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,333
<i>Think you can shut me up?</i>

3
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:59,250
<i>Go fuck yourself!
Take off these handcuffs, faggot!</i>

4
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,625
<i>I'll remember you two cunts!</i>

5
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:05,958
<i>Easy!</i>

6
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,792
Don't touch me!
Hands off!

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,792
I can walk by myself.

8
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,667
Fuck off, asshole.

9
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,708
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,333
<i>Take off the handcuffs first.</i>

11
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>Take them off.
Or I won't go in there.</i>

12
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,625
<i>How dumb do I look?</i>

13
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,708
<i>Take off these handcuffs!</i>

14
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,958
So Malik, are you listening?

15
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,375
Do you understand me?

16
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,458
I understand I got six years.

17
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,417
You're an adult now.
You go to the joint.

18
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,333
You're in with the big guys.

19
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,792
Here... Sign here.

20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,708
What is it?

21
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,333
For legal aid.

22
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,833
- Is it money?
- Money for me.

23
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,542
So I get reimbursed.
Sign here.

24
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,917
Money for you?

25
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,167
Thank you.

26
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,167
Hands up.

27
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,375
Higher.

28
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,458
Palms out.
Shake your hair.

29
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,333
Mouth open.

30
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,875
Tongue out.

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,333
Turn around.

32
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,958
Bottom of your feet.

33
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,125
The other.

34
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,167
Bend over.

35
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:37,917
Cough.

36
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,792
No money in here.

37
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,750
For when you get out.

38
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,375
Give him a uniform and shoes.

39
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,458
These are garbage.
Can't have them here.

40
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,458
Any family on the outside?

41
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,375
No, sir.

42
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,458
- No one to wire you money?
- No, sir.

43
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,542
Friends inside, or enemies?

44
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,458
No one, sir.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,708
You start under observation.

46
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,042
So we can make an evaluation.

47
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,458
See how you fit in.

48
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,042
Then you'll get a permanent cell.

49
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,958
Are you religious?

50
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,458
Your religion.

51
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,958
Do you go to prayers?

52
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,583
Any dietary requirements?

53
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,708
Nothing unusual, sir.

54
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,042
Do you eat pork?

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,042
No. Yeah...

56
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,292
How will you get money wired to you?

57
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,542
I don't know.

58
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,917
You want to work?

59
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,500
- What do you do besides attacking cops?
- I didn't do a thing!

60
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,458
Vocational training?
Anything?

61
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,750
Keep to the side, please.

62
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:19,375
Boss!

63
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,458
You the new guy?

64
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,083
You're in the workshop.

65
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,792
Got anything from outside?

66
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,167
Cell phone, hash, pills?

67
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,708
What the hell?
I got nothing at all.

68
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,708
You get money orders?
Any friends outside?

69
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:11,458
What do you want?

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,042
I want your sneakers.
They're nice.

71
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,125
Can I have them?
I'll give you flip-flops.

72
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,792
Go fuck yourself.

73
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,083
Faggot!

74
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,083
Dirty bastard!

75
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,292
<i>In your cells. Lock-up time.</i>

76
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,625
<i>Lock-up time.</i>

77
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:29,625
Line up.

78
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:36,875
Cesar!

79
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,750
Go get Cesar!

80
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,917
The guy on the right.

81
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,708
Why is that dirty Arab here?

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,583
They probably brought him in
for the Farraldo trial.

83
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,042
Luciani. Infirmary.

84
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,292
Luciani. Consultation.

85
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:48,958
So?

86
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,958
They brought him in
for the Farraldo trial.

87
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,500
His lawyer plea bargained.

88
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,792
Got a lesser sentence.

89
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,125
He's here till the trial.

90
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,958
Jacky Marcaggi wants you to bump him.

91
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,292
When is the trial?

92
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,042
The 14th.

93
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,833
In ten days?

94
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:14,167
Short notice.

95
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:17,708
Does he suspect anything?

96
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,917
The usual.

97
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,375
Like any rat.
He asked to transfer to the Muslims.

98
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:25,125
And if he gets solitary,

99
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,125
we lose our chance.

100
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,458
He stays in his cell all day.

101
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:42,708
Sees no one.
Never goes out. Doesn't eat.

102
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,875
He requested cellblock B with the Muslims.

103
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:53,042
We have to do it in his temp cell.

104
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,375
Hit and run?

105
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,042
We can't risk one of ours.

106
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,958
Keep your ears open.
We'll find a way.

107
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,542
Any contacts in A?

108
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,583
Besides the porter, no one.

109
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,958
Open up! Dinner!

110
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,542
The door should already be open.

111
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,458
Yeah, I know.

112
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,875
- Not eating?
- No. Just some bread.

113
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,042
Bread.

114
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,500
The other one.

115
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,833
Enjoy.

116
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,042
- When is mail?
- Morning.

117
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,167
- How's it going?
- Fine.

118
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,500
Bread?

119
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,542
Enjoy.

120
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,833
What the fuck?

121
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,958
I recognize you.

122
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,542
We're neighbors.

123
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,125
What's your name?

124
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:15,750
What's it to you?

125
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,125
What block were you assigned to?

126
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,917
You know yours?

127
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:22,792
Yeah, B.

128
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,250
Ask for B.
It's for us brothers.

129
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,625
Come closer.

130
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,500
I said come closer.

131
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,792
Want some hash?

132
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,542
Yeah, hash. Yes or no?

133
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,125
Yeah, but... I have no money.

134
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,875
We'll work it out.

135
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,292
What do you mean?

136
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,958
I'll bribe a guard and you come suck me.

137
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,458
- What?
- Suck me off.

138
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:50,500
Fuck off, asshole!

139
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,292
I should suck you?
Motherfucker!

140
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,083
Go fuck yourself!

141
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:56,750
Shut your face!

142
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,042
Faggot!

143
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,458
You okay?

144
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,792
See you in the yard.

145
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,125
This way.

146
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,875
How old are you?

147
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,125
Nineteen. Why?

148
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,167
Don't look at me.
Look at the guy next to me.

149
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,958
Look at me.

150
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,875
I hear you got six years.

151
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,583
That's a long time.

152
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,292
You think you can last here
without protection?

153
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,833
I'll manage.

154
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,250
- What do you want?
- To protect you.

155
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:57,958
- You speak Arabic?
- Sure I do.

156
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,125
The guy in the shower yesterday...

157
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,125
You know him?

158
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,500
What did he want?

159
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,708
He wanted to talk.

160
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,333
Don't look at me, I said.

161
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,000
I want you to keep it up.

162
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,750
Get close with him, make friends.

163
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,417
Why?

164
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,958
You're going to kill him.

165
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,417
Let him go.

166
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,625
Come closer.

167
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,000
Closer. Next to him.

168
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,083
You can handle it.

169
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,917
You won't be alone.
We'll help.

170
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,417
Just remember one thing.

171
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,875
Now that you're in on it,
if you don't kill him, I kill you.

172
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,792
Okay, now beat it.

173
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,667
Got it?

174
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,750
Beat it and keep quiet, understood?

175
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,000
I can't kill anyone...

176
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,958
<i>Yes?</i>

177
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,792
Can I speak to the director?

178
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,625
<i>There's a procedure.
First you request an appointment.</i>

179
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,542
The warden...

180
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,750
Can I talk to the warden?
Right now.

181
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,833
- <i>What for?</i>
- I need him!

182
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,625
<i>Let me check.</i>

183
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,750
I have a problem.

184
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,792
We run this place.
What do you want from us?

185
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,500
Nothing?
So shut up and do as we say.

186
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,208
Reyeb is wary.
He won't let you in so easily.

187
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,500
Are you listening?

188
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,167
I'll start over.

189
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,750
Are you watching?

190
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,625
He won't let you in easily.

191
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,167
You can't be carrying anything.

192
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,125
Talk to him. Act natural.
About your mother, visitors...

193
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,750
Talk normally.

194
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,167
Cut here.

195
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,167
You stroke his balls.

196
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,833
Put a hand on his shoulder.

197
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,708
Spring up and do it.
Get it?

198
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,708
So it's okay for the hash.

199
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:42,333
Can't hear you!

200
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,833
It's okay for the hash.

201
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,083
Okay, I'll tell the hack.

202
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,333
Step back.

203
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,583
What?

204
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,500
Step back, I said.

205
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,917
Turn around.

206
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,333
Turn around!

207
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,833
Lower your hands.

208
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,375
Guard!

209
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,250
Is that him?

210
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,458
El Djebena, move it!

211
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,750
Give us a minute.

212
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,292
Trouble in the workshop?

213
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,542
- What did he do?
- Kicked a guy.

214
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,042
You kicked a guy?

215
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,083
What did he do to you?

216
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,542
Nothing?

217
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,625
He did nothing and you kicked him?

218
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,875
Know what I think?

219
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,250
You did it to go to the hole.

220
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,000
Am I wrong?

221
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:42,417
Think we won't call on you there
to do what we asked?

222
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:43,750
Is that it?

223
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,458
Bitch!

224
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,500
Piece of shit!

225
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,792
Asshole!

226
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,042
Stop it, Cesar!

227
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,625
He's going to bleed, so watch out.

228
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Check the bottom of your shoes.

229
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,917
Leave the blade in his hand.

230
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:25,125
Your turn now.
You be the girl.

231
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,708
Try harder or it'll never work!

232
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:49,625
Go on.

233
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,583
Good.

234
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,292
Let's go.

235
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:11,875
Come in.

236
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,542
Don't move.

237
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,125
Hands up.

238
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,042
Hands up, I said!

239
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,750
Sorry, not everyone here is a friend.

240
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,042
I call the shots.

241
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:41,083
Sit down.

242
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:43,417
There, on the bed.

243
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,792
The bed, I said!

244
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,458
Want something?

245
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:49,500
Water?

246
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:50,750
Kawa?

247
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:52,667
Coffee.

248
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,583
Interested?

249
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,417
- In what?
- The books.

250
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,000
Like to read?

251
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,083
I don't know.

252
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,667
Don't know what?

253
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,083
You can't read, right?

254
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,917
It's not too late.

255
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,917
There's a prison school.

256
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,125
You can learn in here.

257
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,083
Sugar?

258
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,042
The idea is to leave here
a little smarter.

259
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:54,625
Here.

260
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,125
I see you in the yard.

261
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,083
Always by yourself.

262
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:08,250
Always in the same clothes.

263
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,250
No friends here? No one?

264
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,500
I'm in transit.

265
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,542
Just passing through.

266
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,125
I can leave you some books.

267
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,583
You can always learn to read.

268
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,708
Shut your fucking trap!

269
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,458
You okay?

270
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:43,417
Are you okay?

271
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,792
What are you doing?

272
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:48,792
Come.

273
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,042
From Cesar Luciani.

274
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,792
You're now under his protection.

275
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,750
I saw your form.
You barely filled it out.

276
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,125
Are you interested?

277
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,417
So why not fill it out?

278
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,292
I don't understand.

279
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:53,792
Want to learn?

280
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,917
You wrote your name,
so you can write a little.

281
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:01,917
Yeah, a little.

282
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,583
When did you stop school?

283
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,000
When I was eleven.

284
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,833
Can you recognize an "Exit" sign?

285
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:14,333
French your mother tongue?

286
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,625
With your parents was it French, Arabic?

287
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,750
I wasn't with them.

288
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,875
Which did you speak first?

289
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,417
Both.

290
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,625
Where was your school?

291
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:32,917
The juvenile center.

292
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:38,333
There's a word with an "A,"
but it's not pronounced.

293
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,750
The fourth word.

294
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,583
The fourth word.
Which word is that?

295
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,417
"Dans."

296
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,708
Let's go back to the second word.

297
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,333
The second word...
Go on...

298
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,417
"Canard."

299
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:56,917
This word contains two syllables.

300
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,083
"Ca...

301
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,667
nard."

302
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:05,208
Repeat it for me,
separating both syllables.

303
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:08,417
Great.

304
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,792
In the first syllable,

305
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,292
is the "A" in the beginning

306
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,250
or at the end?

307
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,750
Happy birthday, brother.

308
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:49,917
ONE YEAR

309
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,667
Stop it! Stop it!

310
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,583
Aren't you ashamed?

311
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:02,250
Who's their security crew?

312
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,083
- You know them?
- Who?

313
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:06,500
The Muslims.

314
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:13,125
These fucking Arabs!

315
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,083
At least dogs fuck in silence.

316
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:31,542
Three euros 40!

317
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,875
How much is that?

318
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,042
How much in francs?

319
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,125
Money's money.

320
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,875
Twenty francs?

321
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:42,542
Give me the cookies.

322
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,333
Can you shop for me?

323
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:46,250
You bummed off me last time.

324
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,000
- I didn't.
- Ask him!

325
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:49,250
What do you want?

326
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,875
Soap, granola and Coca Cola, please.

327
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:53,625
- No Coke.
- Why not?

328
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,417
Not on my commissary card!

329
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:58,792
- But it's for me.
- Don't be a pain in the ass!

330
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:00,208
Stop bumming off us!

331
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,250
Bum off your people.

332
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:04,792
Or your friends outside.

333
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,917
It pisses me off he's here!

334
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,708
He's not one of us.

335
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,333
Let him clean up if you want.

336
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,125
But when he's done, he's out.
Dirty Arab!

337
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,500
You done? Get out.

338
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,417
Fuck off!

339
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:55,917
Go fuck off.

340
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,250
Dirty Arab!

341
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:12,458
How much time do you have left?

342
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,792
Another two...

343
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,917
three years.

344
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,083
And you...

345
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,792
Rabbia: Rage.

346
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:28,042
Rabbiosu...
In a rage, furious.

347
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,458
Raccia...

348
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,083
To caw.

349
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,250
Who cares?

350
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,708
Radica: Root.

351
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:04,208
Electricity is like water in a circuit.

352
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:06,708
Whatever the size of the pipe,

353
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,625
the flow-rate is constant.
Same here.

354
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:13,417
The current remains the same
at I1, I2 and I3.

355
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,667
You have to replace "he" by "we."

356
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:16,625
Understand?

357
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:18,875
"He ate first." Go on.

358
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:20,417
"We eat first."

359
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:25,083
You're right for "we," but "eat"...
What's the past tense?

360
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,083
"We ate."

361
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,292
Good job. "We ate" is the past.
Now try the subjunctive.

362
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:37,750
"Would...

363
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:39,833
"that we eat."

364
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,250
People say that?

365
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,750
It's wild.
I never did but they do.

366
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:48,292
One day I saw a job ad.
For security guard.

367
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,708
I didn't have a dog.
So I bought one secondhand.

368
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:54,583
I didn't know, so I got a Rottweiler.

369
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,208
Know what they're like?
And his name was Tyson.

370
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:02,792
He came with the name: Tyson.
He was huge!

371
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:05,417
See this?

372
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,750
This was the size of his poops.

373
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:11,417
He took enormous dumps...
Bigger than mine.

374
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:15,583
So I work in a store.
A big supermarket.

375
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,917
I leave the dog to sniff around.
I go outside.

376
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,500
For a cigarette.

377
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,250
Then I try to go back in.

378
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:24,750
I couldn't.

379
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,875
He didn't always recognize me.

380
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:28,917
Your own dog?

381
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:32,250
But he was crazy.
Tyson was a psycho.

382
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:35,833
I go inside
and he comes charging towards me.

383
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,875
I panic, reach out my arm.

384
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,667
He grabs me like this.

385
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,417
I take out my mace, spray him.

386
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:46,500
He lets go. I run out, scared shitless.
What do I do?

387
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:48,000
I leave him inside.

388
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,583
Soon the employees start coming.

389
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,417
I didn't know they used
a back door to go inside.

390
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:57,500
The hound had a field day.

391
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,125
He tore every last one to pieces.

392
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:06,042
He was like Karim in cellblock B.

393
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,667
Why are you here?

394
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,083
Returning books.

395
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,417
Move it.
You, come with me.

396
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,875
Why are you with him?

397
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,833
- He's a brother.
- He's a Corsican!

398
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:25,875
Dirty bastard!

399
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:26,917
Pig!

400
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,917
You calling me a pig?

401
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,083
Who's the pig?

402
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,750
Calling me a pig?

403
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,417
I'm a pig?

404
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:37,708
Let go of me!

405
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:42,750
This isn't right!

406
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,792
It's not Corsica here!

407
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,125
You're being disrespectful.

408
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:54,958
El Djebena!

409
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,042
Tell your boss there's a new hack to meet.

410
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:06,625
Got the papers?

411
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:09,625
They're not in yet.
I got the laundry.

412
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:11,792
Make coffee.

413
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:13,542
For everyone?

414
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,250
Did you see Ilbanez?

415
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,125
He'll come by later with the new hack.

416
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:35,417
Luciani.

417
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:36,750
Vettori.

418
00:41:37,292 --> 00:41:39,125
- Antarro.
- Santi.

419
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:40,833
- Ceccaldi.
- Profundi.

420
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,333
Mosconi.

421
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,250
Pilicci.

422
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,250
- Valpato.
- Corleoni.

423
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,042
El Djebena.

424
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:57,958
<i>Homeland Security announced</i>

425
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:01,792
<i>that Corsicans will serve prison time
closer to home.</i>

426
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
<i>The ruling was made public today,</i>

427
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:09,750
<i>the culmination of the reshuffling,
advocated by Nicolas Sarkozy,</i>

428
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,583
<i>of France's political prisoners.</i>

429
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,458
<i>No comment, as of yet,
from the Corsican Nationalist Front.</i>

430
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:17,750
<i>Cesar!</i>

431
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,208
<i>You there?</i>

432
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,792
<i>Hear the news?</i>

433
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:34,833
<i>When do we get out?</i>

434
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:38,125
When the law is cleared
at the cabinet meeting.

435
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,458
<i>Soon?</i>

436
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:44,500
I have no idea.

437
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,792
Luciani. For Mr. Sampiero.

438
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:03,375
I can at least tell you
who's not concerned.

439
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,958
You're not. You know it.

440
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:11,458
Pilicci, Antarro and Prof neither.
You all screwed up bad.

441
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:15,708
Back then it wasn't called screwing up.

442
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:20,625
Santi and Vettori are up for parole,
so for them...

443
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:27,000
You're saying I'm going to die alone here.

444
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,458
Don't talk like that.

445
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:35,417
You're not alone.
You carry weight outside.

446
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:39,625
And here?

447
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:42,500
Here!

448
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:46,458
Guard, I've put up three of these.
It's a lack of respect.

449
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,292
Seriously.

450
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,792
You work for Imam Moussab?

451
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:54,500
He helps rehabilitate sick inmates.
He got me a job.

452
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:58,792
I work for him a little.
Some day I'll have a real job.

453
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:02,167
- You're sick?
- That's why I got pardoned.

454
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,542
You're leaving?

455
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:08,750
You got AIDS?

456
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:12,292
Of course not! Don't say that.
Are you crazy?

457
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,125
What do you got?

458
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,125
Testicle cancer.

459
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:24,000
Cancer on your balls?

460
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:27,250
Stop shouting!
Why not make an announcement?

461
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,500
Besides, it's over.

462
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,292
So you're better.

463
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:32,542
Thank God. I am.

464
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:34,958
Does it hurt?

465
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,125
No, it doesn't.

466
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:40,375
The chemotherapy hurts.
You lose your hair.

467
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:43,292
You feel like you're 80.
Always tired.

468
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:47,458
Otherwise, thank God, it's over.
I can even have kids.

469
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:53,625
For your balls, brother.

470
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:54,833
Good going.

471
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,250
What's your sign?

472
00:44:58,583 --> 00:44:59,583
Cancer!

473
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,125
I'm just teasing.

474
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,042
I'm Aries.

475
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:11,583
<i>So long, Cesar!</i>

476
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,625
<i>Take care, my friend!</i>

477
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:17,625
We won't forget you, Cesar!

478
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,167
Be strong, Volfoni!
See you in Bastia!

479
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:15,958
You keep the phone on you?

480
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,542
Why not leave it with someone else?

481
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:45,208
I speak Corsican.

482
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,625
I speak your language.

483
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,375
When I was on the phone,

484
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,917
did you understand?

485
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:03,000
You spoke to a "lawer."

486
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:05,125
A what?

487
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,625
A lawyer?

488
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:12,792
Who taught you?

489
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,458
You... and the others.

490
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,167
I was watching, listening.

491
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,292
You mean spying.

492
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:22,208
I wasn't spying at all.

493
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:23,917
I was learning. Listening.

494
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:25,542
You were here...

495
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:30,333
If you weren't spying,
what were you doing? Making fun?

496
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,750
If I was making fun,
I'd never have told you.

497
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,125
So why tell me?

498
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,833
Because the others left?

499
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:42,125
Look at me, you Arab!

500
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,292
Because the others left?

501
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:45,625
Right?

502
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:46,458
Yeah.

503
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,750
Does anyone else know?

504
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,292
It has a life of its own.

505
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,417
Come sit down.

506
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,000
Sit your ass down!

507
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:17,458
You keep it now.

508
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,375
Hold onto it but don't use it.

509
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,125
All hacks aren't like Ilbanez.

510
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:27,167
If they find it, you do hole time.

511
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:31,750
You keep on doing the laundry,
cleaning up...

512
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:37,125
Ilbanez will transfer you
to the cell next door.

513
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,917
I'll have you made porter.

514
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,125
You'll get paid, shop at the commissary,
walk anywhere you want.

515
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,958
You'll be my eyes and my ears.

516
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:53,792
And the others?

517
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,125
What, my friends?

518
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:58,792
You watch them too.

519
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:06,417
Are you happy? You look upset.

520
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,792
I'm fine.

521
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:09,833
So say so.

522
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:27,208
EYES AND EARS

523
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,000
What does Cesar say?

524
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,750
The lawyer will help your brother.

525
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:46,792
He doesn't give a shit about my brother.

526
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:50,208
My wife left 10 messages.
He never called back.

527
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:53,583
Santi and Castelli, same thing.

528
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,917
No news. Nothing.

529
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:57,958
Play your card.

530
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:53,583
Did you jerk off?

531
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:54,833
JORDI THE GYPSY

532
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:57,125
<i>I like porn set in castles.</i>

533
00:51:57,292 --> 00:51:59,542
The girls are fancier, cleaner.

534
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:01,292
How often did you come?

535
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:05,042
- When?
- Fuck that!

536
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,708
Who cares when?
Give me that.

537
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,125
Remember with the driver?

538
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,792
She has the stick shift in her pussy.

539
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,792
He fucks her from behind,
slaps her ass.

540
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,750
And when she blows the blonde's husband!

541
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:22,625
Then she walks in with her big dog.

542
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:28,958
I'll give you the rest tomorrow.

543
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,000
You make a lot dealing?

544
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:36,292
Not much.
Enough to shop and buy my own dope.

545
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:37,958
To shop...

546
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,958
You want to work together?

547
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:48,000
I don't understand your game.

548
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:50,792
- No game.
- You work with the Corsicans.

549
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,625
I work for myself.

550
00:52:52,917 --> 00:52:56,750
You don't know everyone in C.
You don't sell to everyone.

551
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,375
What will you do after?

552
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,458
When you get out, what'll you do?

553
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:18,833
I don't know. You?

554
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:22,833
Same thing as in here, only bigger.

555
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,000
Hash?

556
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,458
Yeah, hash.

557
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,292
I'll move big loads.

558
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,417
Marbella-Paris, three cars.

559
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,417
600 kilos each trip.

560
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,125
Don't believe me?

561
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:43,625
I'm just trying to picture 600 kilos.

562
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:49,458
It's like this.

563
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,125
You can't see anything behind it.

564
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:36,333
<i>I got it.</i>

565
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:58,708
<i>They died for no reason!</i>

566
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:02,292
<i>It's you who killed them!</i>

567
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,125
Still need me?

568
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:41,250
You know about my business?

569
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:43,625
- You said to butt out.
- Come on...

570
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:48,125
I don't know. Stuff with Italians.
Casinos in the south.

571
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,458
What is it?

572
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:56,708
How much longer are you in for?

573
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,167
Three years. Minus good behavior.

574
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:00,500
You've done half.

575
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,542
You can get leave days.

576
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,833
- Did you apply?
- The lawyer does that.

577
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:09,458
Did he apply for it?

578
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:11,333
Why are you asking?

579
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:20,250
Fill out a parole application.
I'll have it treated in priority.

580
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:23,125
In the meantime you can go on leave.

581
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:26,208
You go out for me, you come back,

582
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:28,458
and you get paid.
What do you say?

583
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:30,750
What's the risk?

584
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:34,042
There is no risk.
Staying here is the only risk.

585
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,917
By the time the judge gets it,
studies it,

586
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:53,208
requests additional information,

587
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:56,917
you won't have an answer
for five or six months.

588
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,958
I said an answer,
not necessarily a good one.

589
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,833
Got a card with your number?

590
00:57:05,042 --> 00:57:06,167
Give it here.

591
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,625
A lawyer named Sampiero will call you.

592
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:18,292
Give him whatever he asks for.

593
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:19,958
Do everything he says.

594
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:22,583
File the case once he prepares it.

595
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,042
He'll pay you.

596
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:26,333
And for the judge?

597
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:29,125
Don't worry. He'll explain.

598
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,125
Who's he?

599
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,333
Who are these guys? These thugs?

600
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,625
You didn't say it was like this.

601
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:46,625
You know what may happen to me?
Disbarment!

602
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:48,583
I don't need that.

603
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,417
Too late.

604
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:51,625
You're in.

605
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:56,125
For now on, you're a model prisoner.

606
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:01,875
You're a porter.
Be the best in the prison.

607
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:07,000
Study for your tests.
As for the phone, let Antarro keep it.

608
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:08,417
He'll suspect something.

609
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:11,333
I'll say you pissed me off.
He'll believe it.

610
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,375
<i>Salam.</i>

611
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,083
<i>It was great getting your letter.</i>

612
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:27,042
<i>First, I hear from you.</i>

613
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:30,458
<i>Second I see you've made
a lot of fucking progress.</i>

614
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,708
<i>You write like a pro and I'm glad.</i>

615
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,875
<i>At least I served a purpose.</i>

616
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,083
<i>I can tell you now...</i>

617
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,833
<i>it was no piece of cake.</i>

618
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,500
<i>As for what you asked,</i>

619
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,417
<i>I'll try.</i>

620
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,500
<i>I'll send in the request</i>

621
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:45,958
<i>and come visit.</i>

622
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:48,167
<i>Life here isn't great.</i>

623
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:53,208
<i>I'll spare you the "It's better in there"
but honestly,</i>

624
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:54,708
<i>it's tough.</i>

625
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:58,792
<i>Djamila works part-time
and with the kid it's a pain.</i>

626
00:58:59,917 --> 00:59:03,542
<i>As for me, Imam Moussab's center
found me a job.</i>

627
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,875
<i>In telemarketing.</i>

628
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,792
<i>It pays like shit,
but I shut up and do the work.</i>

629
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,625
<i>Keep your chin up!
Your brother, Ryad.</i>

630
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,625
Girls, Martine.
Guys, Jean-Pierre.

631
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,208
A question.

632
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,167
- What's your name?
- Ryad Mnaili.

633
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:21,625
Jean-Pierre, here.

634
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:24,583
You're allowed two mistakes.

635
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:27,625
Careful, put your hand under his head.

636
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:34,625
Issam... meet Malik.

637
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:36,042
Your godfather.

638
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:51,375
It's a car repair shop.
The owner agreed to hire you.

639
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,625
He'll meet you on your leave day.

640
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:57,542
He's the guy who fixes the Imam's cars.

641
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:00,167
He's hired other guys from center.

642
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:04,500
Know what you're doing for them?

643
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:06,917
You don't mind?

644
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:09,958
I get out, get paid.

645
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:12,875
If it's too risky for you now,
just say so.

646
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:17,375
Risky? Are you crazy?
I'm being rehabilitated.

647
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:19,125
Aren't we rehabilitating?

648
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:27,083
Just outside Paris,
they spot the radar, slow down.

649
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,500
All of a sudden,

650
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,333
the car breaks down.

651
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:34,292
It glides along a little.
Where does it stop?

652
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,708
<i>Next to a gas station!</i>

653
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:39,500
<i>The guys get out, start pushing.</i>

654
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:41,292
<i>Guess who comes to help?</i>

655
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:43,000
<i>Go on, take a guess.</i>

656
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:44,458
- Who?
- Guess!

657
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,583
I have no idea.

658
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,708
Customs, buddy! Customs!

659
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:52,417
<i>100 kilos.
They confiscated 100 kilos.</i>

660
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,500
So what's the point?

661
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:26,042
You're going out.

662
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,667
You know what I want.

663
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:31,292
We're in business.
Don't you smoke my hash every day?

664
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:35,792
So I go in the hole for your swag?
Just for a few joints?

665
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:37,458
God damn it!

666
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:39,125
Back in your cell.

667
01:01:39,292 --> 01:01:40,750
- My dessert, sir!
- Inside!

668
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:48,125
What does the prosecution say?

669
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:51,667
In light of the case, I'm not opposed

670
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,625
to granting leave days to Mr. El Djebena.

671
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,708
But he can't stay out over twelve hours

672
01:01:58,292 --> 01:02:00,917
and must sign in at a local precinct.

673
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:04,667
Thank you, sir.
Anything else to add?

674
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,917
Show in the detainee.

675
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:13,542
Hello, Mr El Djebena.

676
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,917
I will grant you a leave day.

677
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:20,292
You leave at 7 a.m.
and must be back at 7 p.m.

678
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:46,167
That's fucking disgusting.

679
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:48,125
Do something.

680
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:24,000
The door.

681
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,917
- Have a good day.
- Good day, sir.

682
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,208
Roll up the window.

683
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,167
Your phone. That's my number.

684
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:34,583
So you can reach me.

685
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:38,708
Can you stop by and meet Djamila?

686
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:41,208
She's all alone.

687
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,667
Got a TV in your cell now?

688
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:57,542
For the day?

689
01:04:58,333 --> 01:04:59,417
Until seven.

690
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:45,167
How's Cesar?

691
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:47,292
He was okay yesterday.

692
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:51,208
You'll drop this off somewhere for us.

693
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:54,292
- And then?
- Then you come back.

694
01:05:55,292 --> 01:05:56,750
Cesar said you ask no questions.

695
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:59,042
Cesar said I'd be paid.

696
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,708
For afterwards. Okay?

697
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:08,750
What are we going to do there?

698
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,000
Wait till he comes back.

699
01:06:11,292 --> 01:06:12,917
And if something goes wrong?

700
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:17,208
Who cares?

701
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,458
Middle of nowhere.

702
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:37,167
There, on the right.

703
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:38,750
Here, here. On the right.

704
01:06:38,917 --> 01:06:40,333
Pull over.

705
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:48,167
There's a car in front.

706
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:12,125
He's Arab!

707
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:13,958
The courier.

708
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:15,292
Should I let him in?

709
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,125
What the hell?

710
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:38,708
Who are you?

711
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:40,458
Malik El Djebena.

712
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:41,875
Who sent you?

713
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:43,000
Luciani.

714
01:07:43,917 --> 01:07:45,667
Luciani's in the joint!

715
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:46,958
Who the hell are you?

716
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:49,000
I do time with him.

717
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:51,833
Are you in jail or out?

718
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:53,833
I'm on leave for the day.

719
01:07:54,042 --> 01:07:56,125
You work for those scumbags?

720
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,875
I work for no one.
I work for myself.

721
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:00,917
They say deliver, I deliver.

722
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,583
Is it all there?

723
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,833
Yeah.

724
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,333
Can I go now?

725
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:10,958
Forgetting something?

726
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:13,083
Don't you know about the swap?

727
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:28,458
Let's get going.

728
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,292
Shut up.

729
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:53,917
Call Cesar...

730
01:08:56,042 --> 01:08:58,417
You have to call Cesar.

731
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:18,292
It's me.

732
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,583
I've got a problem.

733
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:22,875
I'm not alone.
I'm with Santi.

734
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:57,833
Rue de Madrid. They're waiting.

735
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:01,250
We have to go.
Can you make it back alone?

736
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:04,167
- Message for Cesar?
- I'll call him.

737
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:06,500
Make sure you get back on time.

738
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,042
We may be working together again.

739
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,167
- What is it?
- You know...

740
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:15,333
God damn!

741
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,625
- How much is there?
- 25 kilos.

742
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:24,708
There's this too.

743
01:12:27,917 --> 01:12:28,917
5000.

744
01:12:31,292 --> 01:12:34,375
5000 euros... and 25 kilos of hash?

745
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,750
All in one day?

746
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:40,292
We get guys to stock and sell.
We supply.

747
01:12:41,292 --> 01:12:43,917
We use convoys and buy at the source.

748
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:45,667
The gypsy has contacts.

749
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,333
We need three big cars.
Paris-Marbella, in one night.

750
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,083
The first car scouts.

751
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,292
The second car carries the load.

752
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,417
Further back, an escort vehicle.

753
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,917
<i>The cars stay in touch all night long.</i>

754
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,458
Each car is one exit apart.

755
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:05,750
Hold on, I've never done this before.

756
01:13:05,917 --> 01:13:07,292
So what's the problem?

757
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:08,750
Neither have I.

758
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:12,583
You run the projects, me the prison.

759
01:13:12,875 --> 01:13:15,542
I'll cut a deal with inmates on leave.

760
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:19,667
Jordi knows a trucker
who delivers to the prison.

761
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:24,500
We put half the money back in
and split the rest in three.

762
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,250
Sounds good.

763
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:30,458
Wire some to my commissary account.
For the rest we'll see.

764
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:33,500
- What time is it?
- 6:45.

765
01:13:35,417 --> 01:13:36,917
Let me tell you something.

766
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:38,875
Let me tell you.

767
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,625
Come out whenever you want!

768
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:47,458
- Watch out.
- You too.

769
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,917
El Djebena, Malik.
35-114T.

770
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,208
- Was it for training?
- Auto repair.

771
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:02,125
- You like car repair?
- Yeah, whatever.

772
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:04,625
I'm rehabilitating.

773
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,583
Bend over.

774
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,458
Cough.

775
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,833
Sampiero said I might do it again.

776
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,708
What do you think?

777
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,083
It's cool.

778
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:17,542
You see?

779
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,250
Who did you see besides Sampiero?

780
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:23,875
My friend.
The one who got me the job.

781
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:26,458
Is there a problem?

782
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:32,125
I want it clear.
Your prison leave belongs to me.

783
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:33,542
Period.

784
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:36,000
Here, I keep on being your "Arab?"

785
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:37,958
Yes, you do the shit-work.

786
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:54,542
Names in the upper right-hand corner
and fold it backwards.

787
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:57,208
You have one hour for the French.

788
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,042
We'll do Economics last.

789
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:02,917
- We write on the pages?
- Yes, directly on the exam.

790
01:15:10,792 --> 01:15:13,208
ECONOMICS

791
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:39,875
Buddy!

792
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,583
I heard from your mother.

793
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:10,250
Gentlemen, take your seats.

794
01:16:10,417 --> 01:16:12,542
I'll hand out the Economics exam.

795
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:17,625
El Djebena.

796
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:18,792
Morning, sir.

797
01:16:22,292 --> 01:16:24,625
- Batteries?
- The big ones.

798
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,625
- Malik.
- Sophie.

799
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:20,167
Am I crazy or do they keep multiplying?

800
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:23,792
Soon they'll bring out the rugs.

801
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:27,333
Before, we ruled the yard.

802
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,000
Good thing they're dumb.

803
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:36,417
If they stopped thinking
with their balls,

804
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:38,958
they'd have evolved more.

805
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:44,458
You should walk over there
and check things out.

806
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:46,542
I don't think so.

807
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:49,667
What do you mean?

808
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:55,000
You want me to go get beat up?

809
01:17:55,167 --> 01:17:56,958
Why would they beat you up?

810
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:59,417
Are you crazy?
For them I'm Corsican.

811
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:04,333
They don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground!

812
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:17,792
Send a few hacks there.

813
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:21,458
To mess with them.
They'll eat out of your hand.

814
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:24,792
Thatta boy.

815
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:30,375
Just another Arab thinking with his balls.

816
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,167
YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE

817
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:26,042
<i>Let me introduce you to some friends.</i>

818
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,333
<i>Marbella, man!</i>

819
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:29,167
<i>This is Khalid!</i>

820
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,125
<i>Yo, bro!</i>

821
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:34,375
<i>This is Mishka!</i>

822
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,083
<i>This is Damien.</i>

823
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,542
<i>And here's Olivier.
Say hi to Malik.</i>

824
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,250
<i>What's your name?</i>

825
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:41,833
<i>My name is Fernanda!</i>

826
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:43,125
<i>And I like cock!</i>

827
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,083
<i>Marbella!</i>

828
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,500
Over in cellblock B...

829
01:19:58,083 --> 01:20:02,292
What do the Muslims do?
Smuggle in stuff? Drugs?

830
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,708
They toe the line.

831
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,833
Really?
You got nothing on them?

832
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:12,250
Don't you think it might be good

833
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:15,375
to send in a couple high-strung guys?

834
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:17,500
To mess with them a bit.

835
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,583
Why mess with them?

836
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:21,333
Why?

837
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:26,500
To show who's boss, whose hand to kiss,
whose back to rub.

838
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:28,375
Isn't it obvious?

839
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:32,375
Before there were twenty of you.
Now five.

840
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,375
See the difference, or not?

841
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,333
What kind of difference?

842
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:44,000
I can't do for five
what I did for twenty.

843
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:48,125
So why the hell are you here?

844
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,000
Want a transfer?
I'll tell Marcaggi.

845
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:51,958
I'll be okay.

846
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,125
You'll what?

847
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:55,042
I'll manage. I'll see what...

848
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:56,542
You'll manage?

849
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,208
Use your head.

850
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,000
Tomorrow tell me

851
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:02,625
what you can do for me.

852
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,750
We have a problem, brother.

853
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,167
File a complaint.
What can I say?

854
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:43,708
Maybe Luciani can do something.

855
01:21:44,792 --> 01:21:45,708
I don't get it.

856
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:50,208
First I'm their lapdog
and now I should kiss their asses?

857
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:53,208
Don't do it for me,
do it for the brothers.

858
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:58,167
So I should make up
for being their slave by being yours?

859
01:21:58,417 --> 01:22:00,417
If you want a favor, learn to ask.

860
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,042
What do you want?

861
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:06,542
What can I get out of it?

862
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:07,708
Respect.

863
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:09,375
Do I look Corsican?

864
01:22:09,542 --> 01:22:11,542
Are you getting a big head?

865
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:14,542
I'll see what I can do.

866
01:22:34,542 --> 01:22:35,583
Luciani.

867
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:46,750
You meet here now?

868
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,333
It's heated. It's cozy.
Nice ocean view.

869
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:52,333
Sit down.

870
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,583
I'm fine here.

871
01:22:54,792 --> 01:22:56,208
What do you want?

872
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,708
I have a problem in Marseille.

873
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:03,375
One of yours.
Brahim Lattrache.

874
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:06,500
I want a message delivered to him.

875
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:10,625
Tell him Luciani
will talk one on one, okay?

876
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:13,375
I'll see.

877
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,333
What about the hacks?

878
01:23:17,167 --> 01:23:18,292
I'll see.

879
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:22,208
Brahim Lattrache in Marseille.

880
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:30,917
See the guy in red?

881
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:34,042
He'll turn around and start over.

882
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,125
Those two, running...

883
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:42,750
See the small one with the beanie?

884
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:45,000
He'll do push-ups.

885
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:51,708
Check out the game.

886
01:23:52,042 --> 01:23:53,708
Watch the hoop.

887
01:23:58,083 --> 01:23:59,417
Missed. Up yours!

888
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:01,542
Him.

889
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:11,583
For me you don't see anything?

890
01:24:16,042 --> 01:24:17,750
Yes... snow.

891
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:39,500
Okay! I'll pull over!

892
01:24:41,792 --> 01:24:43,042
Go fuck yourself...

893
01:24:44,792 --> 01:24:46,042
Faster, faster!

894
01:24:50,917 --> 01:24:51,625
Okay!

895
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,875
<i>They let one car pass 
then ambushed Riyad.</i>

896
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:00,958
Took him along with the hash.

897
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:03,083
Now they want money.

898
01:25:04,042 --> 01:25:05,500
Who are these guys?

899
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:06,875
What do you know?

900
01:25:07,042 --> 01:25:11,417
Nothing. Just their boss.
Named Latif, the Egyptian.

901
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,375
From the south side.

902
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:16,333
They use the same route,
know the lowdown.

903
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:20,875
What about the dough?

904
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:25,708
Give them everything they want.

905
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:28,333
Sir!

906
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:29,958
Hear from your friend?

907
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,000
No news. What can I do?
It's been three days...

908
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:34,708
Calm down!

909
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:37,000
It's crowded here and we got hash.

910
01:25:37,167 --> 01:25:38,792
If someone knows the Egyptian,

911
01:25:38,958 --> 01:25:41,208
we'll hear about it, don't worry.

912
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:43,375
When we find him, it'll hurt!

913
01:25:45,417 --> 01:25:47,708
- And the Muslims?
- Coming along.

914
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:50,917
Go see them... and take care of it.

915
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:10,042
I have a favor to ask.

916
01:26:10,292 --> 01:26:11,292
What is it?

917
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:13,208
I need info on someone.

918
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:15,917
- Who?
- A black. Latif the Egyptian.

919
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:17,083
Latif?

920
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:19,208
What can I do?

921
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:21,708
Tell me who he knows in here.

922
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,208
His brother-in-law.

923
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:33,208
What was the trade-off?

924
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:35,042
Nothing. That's my business.

925
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:35,875
See him?

926
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:39,333
The one over there.

927
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,208
The blue beanie.

928
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:44,708
And the other two...

929
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,375
are they his guys?

930
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:47,500
Looks like it.

931
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:49,208
Are the Muslims helping?

932
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,208
They're giving us two guys.

933
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:55,208
No problem.
If it's planned well, it'll be fine.

934
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:26,875
Shut your mouth!

935
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:36,542
Sir!

936
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:40,208
It's his ankle.
He has to see a doctor.

937
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:08,333
The lights!

938
01:28:23,792 --> 01:28:25,042
Mohammed Gazil?

939
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:26,333
You know the Egyptian?

940
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:29,083
- You know him?
- Yes.

941
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:30,167
Sit down.

942
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:36,792
Is Ouassila Gazil your mother?

943
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,375
It's her address on the visitor list?

944
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:40,792
Look.

945
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:45,000
Want to see her alive?

946
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:49,417
Tell Latif I want my friend
and my stuff back.

947
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,333
Call.

948
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:03,875
Where were you?

949
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:05,500
At the registry office.

950
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:07,625
Did it go well?

951
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:10,208
- Have you eaten?
- I need to see a guy.

952
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:13,208
He'll wait.
Come and have a coffee.

953
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,292
Help yourself.

954
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,875
I wanted to talk about something.

955
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:35,375
I saw you with that tall guy,
the Gypsy, in the yard.

956
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:39,500
What's your thing? 
Hashish? Pills?

957
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:41,833
Hash.

958
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:43,708
A lot?

959
01:29:44,167 --> 01:29:45,500
You want your share?

960
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:49,000
It's your business.
It concerns you.

961
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:52,417
- How do you get it in?
- Visiting rooms, kitchens.

962
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:53,708
So you got guards.

963
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,875
A delivery guy.
Frozen goods.

964
01:29:57,542 --> 01:29:59,042
So that's how it works.

965
01:29:59,208 --> 01:30:00,375
For the time being.

966
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,375
What happens if you get nailed?

967
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:13,042
It's the hole.

968
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,625
And then no more leave.

969
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:21,333
What did I tell you last time?

970
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:24,958
I said to watch your step.
Don't risk your leave.

971
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:27,750
What do you do?
You beat up guys.

972
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:30,375
You make the law.
What's your game?

973
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:34,125
You're of use if you go on leave, Djebena.

974
01:30:34,292 --> 01:30:37,000
If you don't, then what good are you?

975
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,042
Get lost.

976
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,417
Get lost!

977
01:31:07,792 --> 01:31:09,042
Bastard!

978
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:16,500
I'm gonna kill you...

979
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:29,417
No longer scared of me?

980
01:31:34,625 --> 01:31:37,042
If you can walk around this place,

981
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,375
it's because I had you made porter.

982
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:42,125
If you eat...

983
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:46,500
it's thanks to me.
If you dream, think, live...

984
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:48,000
it's thanks to me.

985
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:52,792
You say you got no guards.
Dumb shit!

986
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,833
The name Luciani
is branded on your face!

987
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,875
You live off me, Djebena!

988
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:05,292
People look at you and see me.

989
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:08,292
Otherwise what would they see?
Can you tell me?

990
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:39,917
Are you here?

991
01:34:29,167 --> 01:34:30,083
Come here.

992
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,375
Isn't this enough?

993
01:34:34,542 --> 01:34:36,042
Come here, I said.

994
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:38,708
I have something funny to tell you.

995
01:34:45,542 --> 01:34:47,083
You're going to Marseille.

996
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,542
On your next leave,
you go to Marseille.

997
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:56,083
Brecourt-Marseille in one day?

998
01:34:57,708 --> 01:35:01,208
There's a flight at 9 a.m.
Return at 3.

999
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:04,708
There, you'll meet Brahim Lattrache.

1000
01:35:06,292 --> 01:35:07,875
Am I carrying something?

1001
01:35:10,042 --> 01:35:11,917
You talk, you listen.

1002
01:35:12,167 --> 01:35:16,042
See what it'll cost
to cut off ties with the Italians.

1003
01:35:19,292 --> 01:35:22,208
Tell him I'm willing to negotiate

1004
01:35:22,375 --> 01:35:24,792
without Jacky Marciaggi and the others.

1005
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:30,167
As for your pay and your trip,

1006
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:32,292
Sampiero will contact your pal outside.

1007
01:35:37,167 --> 01:35:38,875
Ever taken a plane?

1008
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:27,208
Have a nice day, Truette.

1009
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:28,750
Have a nice day, El Djebena.

1010
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,125
Good day, sir.

1011
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:31,708
Open up, please.

1012
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:05,375
When you pick me up, be on time!

1013
01:37:05,542 --> 01:37:07,375
Careful! Don't talk like that!

1014
01:37:07,542 --> 01:37:10,208
How should I talk?
I take all the risks!

1015
01:37:10,417 --> 01:37:12,125
Yeah, okay, I understand.

1016
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:15,000
This car is bullshit!

1017
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:17,208
Fucking patrol bait!

1018
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:21,042
- You're getting dumb.
- Enough already.

1019
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:22,292
Enough what?

1020
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:27,042
Why are you bossing me around?
If you want out, say so.

1021
01:37:28,958 --> 01:37:30,417
Save it for Latif's trunk.

1022
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:02,125
Get Latif out of your head.

1023
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:06,125
I'll find him and waste his ass.

1024
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,167
You'll waste no one.

1025
01:38:08,708 --> 01:38:10,833
Wake up.
Business has stalled.

1026
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,333
It's not personal.
That fucker blocked everything.

1027
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,583
We got the hash back
but can't move it.

1028
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:22,917
They even fuck with us in our projects.

1029
01:38:23,833 --> 01:38:25,292
I swear, I'll waste him.

1030
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:27,958
Fuck it...

1031
01:38:30,167 --> 01:38:32,167
You look like a lawyer.

1032
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,208
You're boarding at 9:55,
gate 33, terminal 2.

1033
01:38:47,917 --> 01:38:48,792
Enjoy your flight.

1034
01:39:06,542 --> 01:39:07,542
Step forward.

1035
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,125
Arms out.

1036
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:55,292
Your hands!

1037
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:56,167
What for?

1038
01:40:56,333 --> 01:40:57,375
Your hands.

1039
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:48,958
Move.

1040
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:06,167
Is this necessary?

1041
01:42:07,542 --> 01:42:08,875
Doesn't bother me.

1042
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,000
What does Luciani want?

1043
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:14,958
To know your price
for pulling out with the Italians.

1044
01:42:16,167 --> 01:42:20,167
He'll guarantee your take
on the slot machines.

1045
01:42:21,333 --> 01:42:23,167
What's he guaranteeing with?

1046
01:42:23,333 --> 01:42:24,875
His commissary card?

1047
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:27,167
With the Council.

1048
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:29,167
His offer's backed by Marcaggi

1049
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:31,292
and the Corsican Council.

1050
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:37,458
How long have you known him?

1051
01:42:38,708 --> 01:42:39,958
Since prison.

1052
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,167
Worked for him ever since?

1053
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:47,917
It just happened...

1054
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:49,292
Got there, started working.

1055
01:42:52,292 --> 01:42:53,333
Does he protect you?

1056
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:55,375
I work. No protection.

1057
01:42:55,542 --> 01:42:58,458
- You're their Arab. They protect you.
- No, I work.

1058
01:42:59,333 --> 01:43:00,458
What's the price?

1059
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:03,375
You rat?

1060
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:05,125
Run errands?

1061
01:43:06,667 --> 01:43:08,292
- Suck them?
- What the hell?

1062
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:14,958
Why does an Arab work for Corsicans?

1063
01:43:15,167 --> 01:43:16,292
You belly-dance?

1064
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:18,333
You their waitress?

1065
01:43:19,375 --> 01:43:21,708
I had a friend there.
Never got out.

1066
01:43:23,458 --> 01:43:24,708
Named Reyeb.

1067
01:43:25,542 --> 01:43:29,917
Sound familiar?

1068
01:43:32,167 --> 01:43:33,958
Did Luciani have him wasted?

1069
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:38,583
What do you know?

1070
01:43:49,333 --> 01:43:50,625
Animals coming!

1071
01:43:50,792 --> 01:43:51,625
Watch out!

1072
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:06,792
Over there! Two more!

1073
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:09,417
Kill it!

1074
01:44:25,417 --> 01:44:26,792
What's your thing?

1075
01:44:27,417 --> 01:44:28,667
How do you do it?

1076
01:44:29,292 --> 01:44:31,333
What are you?

1077
01:44:31,792 --> 01:44:33,292
A prophet or what?

1078
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,000
I did Reyeb.

1079
01:44:43,542 --> 01:44:45,292
Fuck, you've come a long way.

1080
01:45:14,417 --> 01:45:15,875
What's your name?

1081
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,958
Malik.

1082
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:20,292
I'll wash your shirt and your pants too.

1083
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:23,458
- The pants aren't dirty.
- Are you sure?

1084
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:25,750
Then just give me your shirt.

1085
01:45:49,458 --> 01:45:51,333
Here's your shirt, my son.

1086
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:55,292
I washed it but the bloodstains
won't go away.

1087
01:46:03,792 --> 01:46:05,083
Prophet!

1088
01:46:05,875 --> 01:46:09,083
Tell me something.
Some Muslims asked me about Luciani.

1089
01:46:09,292 --> 01:46:10,167
Was that you?

1090
01:46:13,083 --> 01:46:15,000
You talk with Muslims, Corsicans,

1091
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:16,708
you come here...

1092
01:46:17,792 --> 01:46:19,167
Straddling everyone.

1093
01:46:19,583 --> 01:46:21,792
It's not too great on your balls.

1094
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:24,708
Talk to Lingherri too?

1095
01:46:28,333 --> 01:46:30,667
The Italians have a Corsican snitch.

1096
01:46:30,792 --> 01:46:32,292
Does your boss know?

1097
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:34,417
Are you sure?

1098
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:35,583
Positive.

1099
01:46:35,958 --> 01:46:37,292
Know him well enough?

1100
01:46:41,917 --> 01:46:43,667
So tell that to Luciani.

1101
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,292
I accept his offer on one condition.

1102
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:50,292
He finds the snitch
and he cleans house.

1103
01:46:55,583 --> 01:46:56,792
I have a favor.

1104
01:46:57,417 --> 01:46:59,458
I got trouble with a guy in Paris.

1105
01:46:59,625 --> 01:47:02,125
Named Latif the Egyptian.
You know him?

1106
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:04,542
What can I do?

1107
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Can you tell him we know each other?

1108
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,333
That we work together?

1109
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:14,292
Work together...

1110
01:47:15,292 --> 01:47:16,667
What do you think?

1111
01:47:23,125 --> 01:47:25,167
Let's get sucked before you go.

1112
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,917
- Can I stay on the beach?
- As you like.

1113
01:48:09,958 --> 01:48:10,917
Hurry!

1114
01:48:15,667 --> 01:48:16,917
Did it go okay?

1115
01:48:25,667 --> 01:48:27,917
You and Latif will meet and talk.

1116
01:48:28,708 --> 01:48:31,333
Seriously?
I'm gonna meet that asshole?

1117
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:35,375
Lattrache will contact him.
He'll accept.

1118
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:38,625
He's involved?
You saw him for the Corsicans.

1119
01:48:39,167 --> 01:48:41,208
He needs Luciani, we need Latif.

1120
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:42,875
We help each other.

1121
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:45,917
Work out a deal.

1122
01:48:46,167 --> 01:48:50,542
We go partners, pool everything.
Hide-outs, cars, suppliers.

1123
01:48:51,542 --> 01:48:53,750
We take over the market and we rule.

1124
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,167
You know what you're asking me?

1125
01:48:57,417 --> 01:49:00,333
We'll settle our scores
when the time's right.

1126
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,000
Now we'll do it this way.

1127
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,208
I'm sick again.

1128
01:49:12,625 --> 01:49:14,625
I did tests. They're not good.

1129
01:49:15,167 --> 01:49:16,417
I need more chemo.

1130
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:23,667
Will you be okay?

1131
01:49:29,458 --> 01:49:31,333
Take care, brother.

1132
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:38,792
You're 30 minutes late.

1133
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:40,292
You know the rules.

1134
01:49:40,458 --> 01:49:42,625
I removed car doors all day long.

1135
01:49:42,792 --> 01:49:44,083
Spread your legs.

1136
01:49:45,375 --> 01:49:48,375
I'll let it go for now.
Think about your parole.

1137
01:49:48,542 --> 01:49:49,500
Damn it!

1138
01:49:49,667 --> 01:49:50,667
Check the time!

1139
01:50:08,417 --> 01:50:12,458
I don't give a fuck
about Marcaggi's thanks.

1140
01:50:12,958 --> 01:50:15,875
All I want is for him to move his ass

1141
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,792
and settle this thing.

1142
01:50:19,625 --> 01:50:22,958
As we speak one of our guys is sleeping

1143
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:26,125
with the Italians.
I want to know who.

1144
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,583
Does he know?

1145
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:29,583
Yes.

1146
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:30,792
So?

1147
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:33,417
He's dealing with it.

1148
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:36,708
It concerns him and him alone.

1149
01:50:36,875 --> 01:50:39,625
It was the same for Lattrache.

1150
01:50:40,083 --> 01:50:41,750
You know who he is?

1151
01:50:42,083 --> 01:50:43,167
No.

1152
01:50:46,292 --> 01:50:47,167
Hold on, Cesar.

1153
01:50:47,958 --> 01:50:50,375
Jacky wants you to stay out of this.

1154
01:50:50,542 --> 01:50:52,375
Not to the side, not far.

1155
01:50:52,542 --> 01:50:53,792
Out!

1156
01:50:56,167 --> 01:50:58,750
He says if you need anything...

1157
01:50:58,917 --> 01:51:00,958
I'm okay.
Don't put yourself out.

1158
01:51:07,792 --> 01:51:09,125
Here's some good news.

1159
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:13,083
You asked about creating a hotel company.

1160
01:51:14,292 --> 01:51:17,375
I think I found someone.
A Basque in Pamplona.

1161
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,208
Why do you say "good news?"

1162
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:22,917
You told me to look.

1163
01:51:23,083 --> 01:51:26,083
We're talking about Jacky, Sardinia, casinos,

1164
01:51:26,583 --> 01:51:28,000
you tell me to butt out

1165
01:51:28,208 --> 01:51:30,917
and all of a sudden: "Good news."

1166
01:51:31,083 --> 01:51:32,625
It wasn't good before?

1167
01:51:32,917 --> 01:51:33,958
It was.

1168
01:51:34,667 --> 01:51:36,583
So why "Now some good news?"

1169
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,417
I didn't say "now."

1170
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,542
- I can tell you two good things.
- Can you? It's been ages!

1171
01:51:45,625 --> 01:51:46,708
Thanks, sir.

1172
01:52:02,875 --> 01:52:03,958
Give me the papers.

1173
01:52:12,417 --> 01:52:14,625
You get the scores?

1174
01:52:14,792 --> 01:52:16,083
Which game?

1175
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,125
Why do you make the coffee?

1176
01:52:28,792 --> 01:52:30,875
Why still act like a servant?

1177
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:36,875
You go out for me,
you see Sampiero, you see Lattrache.

1178
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:40,375
You deal with my business...
the casinos.

1179
01:52:40,542 --> 01:52:41,958
The Lingherris.

1180
01:52:43,417 --> 01:52:46,375
And when I ask for a coffee,
you hop to it.

1181
01:52:57,792 --> 01:52:59,292
Nothing to say?

1182
01:53:00,333 --> 01:53:01,792
What's the question?

1183
01:53:02,458 --> 01:53:04,625
Why I do it or how it makes me feel?

1184
01:53:05,333 --> 01:53:06,708
I do it because you ask.

1185
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,458
Want to know how I feel?

1186
01:53:09,625 --> 01:53:10,875
I couldn't care less.

1187
01:53:13,208 --> 01:53:14,625
Still need me?

1188
01:53:15,792 --> 01:53:18,375
You're the one who needs me!

1189
01:53:21,708 --> 01:53:22,667
Can I go?

1190
01:53:33,125 --> 01:53:34,375
Can you hear me?

1191
01:53:35,375 --> 01:53:36,792
When do you see Latif?

1192
01:53:37,875 --> 01:53:41,125
Listen to me.
Give my share to Imam Moussab.

1193
01:53:41,417 --> 01:53:42,625
Give it all to him.

1194
01:53:44,917 --> 01:53:47,417
I have no fucking idea.
Try the mosque.

1195
01:53:47,583 --> 01:53:51,958
I just want the money to get to him,
on behalf of Malik El Djebena.

1196
01:53:52,708 --> 01:53:54,583
He'll know how to find me.

1197
01:53:55,125 --> 01:53:58,792
Do as I say.
Then leave me a message.

1198
01:54:28,625 --> 01:54:30,708
Move your fat ass, nigger!

1199
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:42,875
- Better?
- I'm fine.

1200
01:55:38,917 --> 01:55:41,875
That money at the mosque...
Is it from you?

1201
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:43,958
Is it dirty money?

1202
01:55:44,125 --> 01:55:46,000
Of course it's dirty!

1203
01:55:47,292 --> 01:55:50,917
But it's better in his hands
than in mine.

1204
01:55:51,125 --> 01:55:53,292
You think the Imam will take it?

1205
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,625
That depends on you, guys.

1206
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:03,000
I understand what you do here,
and I respect it.

1207
01:56:03,125 --> 01:56:04,708
But you're not in power.

1208
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:07,583
The Corsicans control the guards.

1209
01:56:08,708 --> 01:56:10,125
You pray in pigsties,

1210
01:56:10,333 --> 01:56:12,417
sleep in shit-holes.
You stand up

1211
01:56:12,583 --> 01:56:13,917
and get knocked back down.

1212
01:56:14,333 --> 01:56:17,292
Maybe the Imam could use that dirty money.

1213
01:56:19,125 --> 01:56:19,917
What do you want?

1214
01:56:21,292 --> 01:56:24,750
Same as you, Hassan.
A better life for me and my friends.

1215
01:56:24,917 --> 01:56:27,292
Do I look stupid? All you want

1216
01:56:27,458 --> 01:56:29,125
is to use us, no more.

1217
01:56:29,333 --> 01:56:30,292
So?

1218
01:56:31,667 --> 01:56:33,333
As long as we're all happy.

1219
01:56:38,083 --> 01:56:38,708
Listen.

1220
01:56:38,917 --> 01:56:41,917
Go straight to the Imam again
and you're dead.

1221
01:56:42,417 --> 01:56:44,250
You talk money with me.

1222
01:56:44,583 --> 01:56:45,917
It's between us. Okay?

1223
01:56:50,875 --> 01:56:54,250
Is that why you gave the Imam money?
To meet with me?

1224
01:56:57,542 --> 01:56:58,417
Thug to thug?

1225
01:56:58,542 --> 01:56:59,250
Cut the shit!

1226
01:56:59,917 --> 01:57:01,417
Just kidding.

1227
01:57:38,042 --> 01:57:40,917
CHRISTMAS

1228
01:57:57,292 --> 01:58:00,125
Handmade.
Without gifts it's not Christmas.

1229
01:58:04,708 --> 01:58:07,542
I'm the gift. 100% handmade.

1230
01:58:07,708 --> 01:58:09,458
What a gift!

1231
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:11,875
No care packages?

1232
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:13,542
Help yourself.

1233
01:58:18,417 --> 01:58:20,333
Is wild boar pork?

1234
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:22,917
Are you kidding?

1235
01:58:24,625 --> 01:58:27,500
Can we stop?
Can you and I talk sincerely?

1236
01:58:30,583 --> 01:58:31,792
Why?

1237
01:58:34,250 --> 01:58:36,625
I'm going to ask a favor of you

1238
01:58:36,792 --> 01:58:38,875
not because you work for me,

1239
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,833
but because I trust you.

1240
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,750
Understand the difference?

1241
01:58:46,125 --> 01:58:47,625
I'm not sure.

1242
01:58:54,917 --> 01:58:57,917
I saw Vettori. He got some info.

1243
01:58:58,125 --> 01:59:01,000
We know who's talking to the Lingherris.

1244
01:59:01,625 --> 01:59:02,917
Form a team.

1245
01:59:03,292 --> 01:59:05,083
What are your guys like?

1246
01:59:06,083 --> 01:59:08,417
- A team for what?
- To whack them.

1247
01:59:08,792 --> 01:59:09,625
The Lingherris?

1248
01:59:09,792 --> 01:59:12,125
The Lingherris and Jacky Marcaggi.

1249
01:59:12,833 --> 01:59:14,333
Whack Marcaggi?

1250
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:16,292
Whack your boss?

1251
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:18,542
No one must know.

1252
01:59:19,333 --> 01:59:21,917
You, me, Vettori and no one else.

1253
01:59:22,708 --> 01:59:24,292
It'll take place in Paris.

1254
01:59:24,667 --> 01:59:27,625
Vettori will give you what you need.
He'll supervise

1255
01:59:27,792 --> 01:59:29,708
but we remain invisible.

1256
01:59:30,292 --> 01:59:31,875
Can you do this for me?

1257
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,292
Any plans for when you get out?

1258
01:59:58,083 --> 02:00:02,417
When we get the casinos,
we'll need someone to run them...

1259
02:00:03,792 --> 02:00:05,042
with Lattrache.

1260
02:00:24,333 --> 02:00:25,125
We'll do it.

1261
02:00:25,333 --> 02:00:26,458
We'll do it!

1262
02:00:26,625 --> 02:00:27,583
I have six months.

1263
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:30,125
Three up and about.

1264
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:31,625
Maybe they're wrong.

1265
02:00:32,042 --> 02:00:34,708
Give me a break.
What's the problem?

1266
02:00:34,875 --> 02:00:36,042
Whacking those guys?

1267
02:00:36,417 --> 02:00:37,792
Keep it down.

1268
02:00:37,917 --> 02:00:39,083
We don't know them.

1269
02:00:39,292 --> 02:00:40,500
What do we care?

1270
02:00:41,083 --> 02:00:43,042
Think about when you get out.

1271
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:45,917
I won't be around.

1272
02:00:46,292 --> 02:00:49,083
You can think about your future.
I can't.

1273
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:50,500
Malik...

1274
02:00:50,917 --> 02:00:51,917
There's Djamila.

1275
02:00:52,083 --> 02:00:53,125
There's my son.

1276
02:00:53,333 --> 02:00:55,708
What will I leave them?
A fridge? A TV?

1277
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,917
What are you talking about?

1278
02:00:58,917 --> 02:01:00,792
You'll be talking care of them.

1279
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:05,417
That's what I'm asking.

1280
02:01:06,542 --> 02:01:08,625
Go tell them it's a deal.

1281
02:01:08,792 --> 02:01:10,000
We'll do it.

1282
02:01:33,917 --> 02:01:35,792
I spoke to my friend outside.

1283
02:01:36,417 --> 02:01:37,417
We'll do it.

1284
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:40,125
He'll tell me when he finds the guys.

1285
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,542
I'll call my man.

1286
02:01:42,708 --> 02:01:46,667
Give me your friend's number.
Vettori will contact him.

1287
02:02:50,625 --> 02:02:52,000
Ever try this?

1288
02:02:53,917 --> 02:02:55,458
I'll give you a little.

1289
02:04:41,083 --> 02:04:42,500
Are you listening?

1290
02:04:42,833 --> 02:04:44,458
We're heading for disaster.

1291
02:04:44,625 --> 02:04:47,875
Our guys are fine for hash.
For the rest, they suck.

1292
02:04:48,125 --> 02:04:51,000
You wanted to do this.
Just figure it out!

1293
02:04:51,125 --> 02:04:52,500
I can't control them.

1294
02:04:52,917 --> 02:04:55,458
When they saw the guns, 
they lost it.

1295
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:57,792
Right away, like kids.

1296
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,458
That asshole Vettori treats us like shit.

1297
02:05:00,667 --> 02:05:04,583
During recon, they fought.
Now Khalid wants to kill him.

1298
02:05:07,125 --> 02:05:08,125
Change guys.

1299
02:05:08,333 --> 02:05:09,417
Now?

1300
02:05:09,542 --> 02:05:11,083
- For a contract?
- Who cares?

1301
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:15,083
One minute.

1302
02:05:22,417 --> 02:05:24,625
I've lost time and money with them.

1303
02:05:26,042 --> 02:05:27,750
Look at the state he's in!

1304
02:05:27,917 --> 02:05:28,917
Watch your mouth!

1305
02:05:29,125 --> 02:05:30,917
I'll put him out of his misery!

1306
02:05:31,083 --> 02:05:32,875
- Hands off!
- Cool it!

1307
02:05:34,917 --> 02:05:37,833
Shut up!
We'll do it, but our way.

1308
02:05:38,417 --> 02:05:40,708
I'm just explaining. Can I?

1309
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:45,833
Listen to me.
We're going to kill them.

1310
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:47,208
Promise me.

1311
02:05:47,417 --> 02:05:50,708
We'll kill them
but they can't see it coming.

1312
02:05:50,917 --> 02:05:52,917
Now I'll slap you.
Look down.

1313
02:05:53,333 --> 02:05:54,042
What?

1314
02:05:54,208 --> 02:05:56,333
I'll slap you and you look down.

1315
02:06:00,458 --> 02:06:01,917
Now he gets it.

1316
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:03,667
Let's move on.

1317
02:06:18,333 --> 02:06:22,458
Pick me up without the others.
You and I will take care of it.

1318
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,208
Will you be able to?

1319
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:33,542
Guard!

1320
02:06:34,583 --> 02:06:38,000
Going to the half-way house
is part of your rehabilitation.

1321
02:06:38,625 --> 02:06:41,667
Yes, Your Honor.
It's a center for convicts...

1322
02:06:41,833 --> 02:06:44,083
I know the Imam Moussab's center.

1323
02:06:45,417 --> 02:06:47,292
You've requested two days.

1324
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,708
That seems a bit much.

1325
02:06:50,083 --> 02:06:53,417
I propose a one-day training module.
Seven to seven.

1326
02:06:54,458 --> 02:06:56,458
- Will that do?
- Yeah, very well.

1327
02:07:11,417 --> 02:07:13,542
<i>Mohammed, peace be with Him,</i>

1328
02:07:13,708 --> 02:07:16,667
<i>arrived on the mountain top
and fell asleep.</i>

1329
02:07:17,083 --> 02:07:20,292
<i>The angel Gabriel appeared.</i>

1330
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:23,000
Know what he told him?

1331
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:25,792
He said:
"Recite. Recite, Mohammed.

1332
02:07:25,917 --> 02:07:28,083
"Recite for God who created you.

1333
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:30,000
"He created mankind from nothing.

1334
02:07:30,125 --> 02:07:33,583
"Recite what he taught you
with his writings."

1335
02:07:36,042 --> 02:07:37,333
Wondrous!

1336
02:07:38,250 --> 02:07:40,292
Wondrous, my brother!

1337
02:08:02,750 --> 02:08:03,667
The door.

1338
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:12,917
Have a good day.

1339
02:08:28,083 --> 02:08:29,792
- Where are the others?
- In back.

1340
02:08:59,458 --> 02:09:01,208
The car comes from here.

1341
02:09:03,417 --> 02:09:05,250
One bodyguard, one driver.

1342
02:09:05,458 --> 02:09:07,625
The bodyguard opens the doors.

1343
02:09:11,542 --> 02:09:13,125
He has a bullet-proof vest.

1344
02:09:13,792 --> 02:09:15,458
We let them come out.

1345
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:19,417
We pop the guard, then them.

1346
02:09:22,417 --> 02:09:23,333
Let's go.

1347
02:10:18,083 --> 02:10:18,792
It's them.

1348
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:20,333
They're coming.

1349
02:10:20,708 --> 02:10:21,417
Black Chevy.

1350
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:23,500
Let them get out.

1351
02:10:24,833 --> 02:10:26,083
I'll do the bodyguard.

1352
02:10:51,792 --> 02:10:53,042
What the fuck?

1353
02:11:40,417 --> 02:11:42,458
Move it! Come on!

1354
02:11:45,708 --> 02:11:46,792
See them?

1355
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:51,208
Okay, now I see them.

1356
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,708
- Three cars ahead.
- Catch up!

1357
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:02,417
They're turning.

1358
02:12:02,833 --> 02:12:04,542
What now? They're stopping!

1359
02:12:04,833 --> 02:12:07,250
- Go on, I'll kill them!
- Kill who?

1360
02:12:07,458 --> 02:12:08,667
It's an armored car!

1361
02:12:09,708 --> 02:12:11,500
It's an armored car, I said.

1362
02:12:12,125 --> 02:12:14,417
Unless you kick them out,
we're fucked.

1363
02:12:22,208 --> 02:12:23,458
What's he doing?

1364
02:12:24,125 --> 02:12:25,250
Buying cigarettes.

1365
02:12:40,583 --> 02:12:41,458
I'm going.

1366
02:12:42,125 --> 02:12:43,417
What are you doing?

1367
02:13:34,417 --> 02:13:35,583
Marcaggi, down!

1368
02:13:37,625 --> 02:13:38,750
Get down!

1369
02:14:11,042 --> 02:14:12,250
I can't hear!

1370
02:14:13,083 --> 02:14:14,833
Can't hear a thing!

1371
02:14:42,583 --> 02:14:43,667
It's not my blood.

1372
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:45,500
It's theirs.

1373
02:15:03,583 --> 02:15:05,833
You pigs, we fucked you over!

1374
02:15:15,875 --> 02:15:17,292
Are you Jacky Marcaggi?

1375
02:15:19,083 --> 02:15:21,833
Don't talk! I can't hear!
Just nod.

1376
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,125
Know him?

1377
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:28,417
Your pal Luciani sent us to kill you.

1378
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:31,208
I won't. I'll leave him to you.

1379
02:15:31,708 --> 02:15:32,875
Take your revenge!

1380
02:15:33,083 --> 02:15:34,500
Let's beat it.

1381
02:16:09,625 --> 02:16:10,542
You sleeping?

1382
02:16:11,375 --> 02:16:13,500
No, I'm not.
I'm exhausted.

1383
02:16:15,375 --> 02:16:16,792
Did you talk to Djamila?

1384
02:16:16,958 --> 02:16:19,000
I'll sleep in the kid's room.

1385
02:16:20,792 --> 02:16:23,083
You don't want to go back tonight?

1386
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:24,750
I'll go tomorrow.

1387
02:16:26,958 --> 02:16:28,500
You'll do hole time.

1388
02:16:29,417 --> 02:16:31,833
While they tear each other apart.

1389
02:16:34,208 --> 02:16:35,583
You need anything?

1390
02:16:40,542 --> 02:16:42,333
I'm not doing the chemo.

1391
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,583
It's hopeless anyway.

1392
02:16:58,708 --> 02:17:00,000
Watch your sleeve.

1393
02:17:00,208 --> 02:17:02,167
You're wiping your plate.

1394
02:17:07,083 --> 02:17:08,542
Eat some, Ryad.

1395
02:17:09,125 --> 02:17:10,167
I'm eating.

1396
02:17:10,375 --> 02:17:11,583
Want something else?

1397
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:12,750
No thanks.

1398
02:17:13,333 --> 02:17:15,667
- Good?
- Delicious, thanks.

1399
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:37,542
El Djebena, Malik.
35-114T.

1400
02:19:51,875 --> 02:19:56,500
40 DAYS 40 NIGHTS

1401
02:21:34,708 --> 02:21:36,000
You there?

1402
02:22:25,542 --> 02:22:27,000
Are you there?

1403
02:26:02,833 --> 02:26:05,500
Make sure it's all there and sign here.

1404
02:26:32,792 --> 02:26:33,750
Garbage.

1405
02:26:51,833 --> 02:26:53,542
Your release form.

1406
02:26:54,750 --> 02:26:55,667
The door.

1407
02:26:57,667 --> 02:26:59,333
Good luck, El Djebena.

1408
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:01,708
Good day, sir.

1409
02:27:29,583 --> 02:27:30,542
How are you?

1410
02:27:36,292 --> 02:27:37,500
It's cold.

1411
02:27:37,667 --> 02:27:38,583
Freezing.

1412
02:27:39,875 --> 02:27:41,625
Not a time to be outside.

1413
02:27:48,125 --> 02:27:49,917
- You came by bus?
- Yes.

1414
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:53,792
When's the next one?

1415
02:27:53,958 --> 02:27:55,417
In half an hour.

1416
02:27:57,917 --> 02:27:59,167
Want to walk a bit?

1417
02:27:59,333 --> 02:28:00,500
If you like.

1418
02:28:01,833 --> 02:28:03,375
Where will you live?

1419
02:28:05,667 --> 02:28:09,625
Come home. I'll take the kid.
Use his bedroom.

1420
02:28:09,792 --> 02:28:12,167
- I don't want to impose.
- You're not.

1421
02:28:52,375 --> 02:28:58,167
A PROPHET
