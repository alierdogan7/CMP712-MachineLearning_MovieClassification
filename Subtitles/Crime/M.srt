1
00:01:54,404 --> 00:02:03,779
Just you wait a little while,
The nasty man in black will come

2
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:12,480
With his little chopper,
He will chop you up!

3
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:14,081
You're out

4
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,773
Stop singing that awful song

5
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:41,441
Don't you hear me?

6
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:47,017
Always that awful song

7
00:02:54,564 --> 00:03:03,404
Just you wait a little while,
The nasty man in black will come

8
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:35,993
What's the matter?

9
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,505
l told those kids to stop
singing that awful song

10
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:43,043
But they keep singing
it over and over

11
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,477
As if we haven't heard
enough of that murderer

12
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:49,550
Oh, leave them be

13
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,018
lf they're singing, at
least we know they're okay

14
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:55,953
Yes, l guess you're right

15
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:32,116
10,000 Marks Reward
WHO lS THE MURDERER?

16
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:35,189
Since June 11, little
KLAUS KLAWlTZKY and

17
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:37,952
his sister KLARA have disappeared

18
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:41,255
Evidence leads us to believe
the children were victims

19
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:44,298
of a similar crime
committed last fall

20
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:47,994
against the DOERlNG sisters

21
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:51,833
What a pretty ball!

22
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:56,972
What's your name?

23
00:05:58,248 --> 00:05:59,875
Elsie Beckmann

24
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,679
Did Elsie come with you?

25
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:34,214
No, she didn't

26
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:06,245
Thank you

27
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:20,055
A thrilling new chapter!
Passionate, moving, sensational

28
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,059
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke

29
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:29,601
-Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.
-Yes?

30
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:31,838
Have you seen Elsie?

31
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:35,110
Didn't she just come up
the stairs?

32
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:38,471
No, she isn't here yet

33
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:40,639
She won't be long now.
Good-bye, Mrs. Beckmann

34
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,643
Good-bye, Mr. Gehrke

35
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:56,615
Extra! Extra! Extra!

36
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:59,380
New crime!

37
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,386
Who is the murderer?

38
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,928
Because the police have not
published my first letter

39
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:15,537
l am writing today
directly to the NEWSPAPERS

40
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:18,239
Continue your investigations

41
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:20,602
Everything will happen

42
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:24,440
just as l have told you.
But l have not yet finished

43
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:34,848
10,000 MARKS REWARD
Who is the murderer?

44
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:39,256
Christ! Here we go again.
lt's horrible

45
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:41,862
10,000 Marks
The lettering is too small

46
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:43,794
We can't read it

47
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:46,161
Hey, you, read it out loud

48
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:48,860
-''The unknown murderer''.
-Let him read! Hey! Quiet!

49
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:52,201
''The terror in our town
has found a new...''

50
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:58,945
Certain evidence leads us
to believe that the murderer

51
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:04,849
is the same one who has
already killed eight children

52
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:07,046
We must remind you again

53
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,324
that a mother's first duty
is to guard her children

54
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:15,658
from the danger which
always threatens

55
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:21,802
Also, the danger is often
hidden in some attractive bait

56
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:29,104
Candy, a toy, and fruit can be
the murderer's weapons

57
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:31,675
True, true!

58
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:36,748
Come on! Come on!
Read, read on

59
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,945
Okay, okay. ''The anxiety of
the general public is very high

60
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:43,387
because the police have not yet
completed their investigations

61
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,392
But the police are faced
with an almost impossible problem.''

62
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:53,730
''The criminal has left no clue.
Who is the murderer?''

63
00:11:54,871 --> 00:12:01,367
What is he like?
Where is he hiding?

64
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:04,707
No one knows.
Still, he is one of us

65
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:07,577
ls it your neighbor?

66
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:13,715
Yes, that's right

67
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:16,452
Why look at me when you say that?

68
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:19,652
-You know very well.
-What do l know very well?

69
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:25,627
-Think about it.
-What are you saying?

70
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:31,736
l saw you go up those stairs
behind that little girl

71
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:34,399
What?! You are crazy,
you dirty swine!

72
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,137
Who's a swine? Me?
Or a man who chases little girls?

73
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:40,680
You bastard! You swine!

74
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:42,482
Murderer!

75
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,578
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

76
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:49,387
l'll see you in court.
l'll see you in court

77
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:53,117
Now, now, gentlemen! Calm down!

78
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:56,394
Slanderer!

79
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:59,530
Trying to ruin my reputation

80
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:01,397
Slanderer! Terrible man!

81
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:05,872
The police listen to him!
They're searching my house!

82
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:08,573
How awful! What a shame!

83
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,212
Searching a man's house
because of an anonymous letter

84
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,510
Mr. Jager, calm down!
We're only doing our job

85
00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:20,217
When we are so upset?
Scared about the children

86
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:24,485
Look, that's why the police
must follow every clue

87
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,288
Any man in the street
could be the guilty one

88
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:32,393
Can you please tell me
what time it is?

89
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:33,693
Yes, my child

90
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:44,439
Now, my child, go home.
Where do you live?

91
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:48,478
What's it to you
where the kid lives?

92
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,322
Why were you bothering that kid?

93
00:13:53,923 --> 00:13:58,917
But - but - l did nothing!
What do you want with me?

94
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:01,521
Just you wait and see

95
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:04,689
Let me go!
lt's an outrage!

96
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,062
-What's going on?
-lt's an outrage!

97
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:08,635
What does he want?

98
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,238
Don't get so excited

99
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:12,273
Punch him in the face!

100
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:15,272
-Bothering children.
-Acting like a big shot!

101
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:18,174
Let me go! l did nothing!

102
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,372
You wanted to get her
alone, didn't you?

103
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,915
Yes, then kill her like
all the others, right?

104
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:27,954
lt's the murderer! lt's him!
Hold him! Call the police!

105
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:31,684
No police around when you
need them. Officer, officer!

106
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:37,356
Move along please,
move along now. Don't block!

107
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:41,663
You can catch pickpockets but
you'd better get the murderer

108
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:44,462
What? ls he the murderer?

109
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:49,107
Move along now.
Come on, get a move on

110
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:06,118
MURDERER WRlTES TO NEWSPAPERS

111
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:23,807
lt's a terrible scandal

112
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:26,743
This will have a bad effect

113
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:32,320
on public opinion, lnspector.
lt's very serious

114
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:37,786
But, sir, we cannot stop the
murderer from writing letters!

115
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,590
This man is a mental case

116
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:42,856
He gets a kick from

117
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:46,832
seeing himself in the papers

118
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:50,763
We immediately got in touch
with the newspaper

119
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,400
They sent us the original letter.
The lab is working on it

120
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:59,241
Of course, you can't get good
fingerprints from a postcard

121
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:03,977
which went through so many hands

122
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:09,087
We'll compare the results
with our archives

123
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:15,390
We must try everything
to find a clue or a lead

124
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:18,192
Then, we'll send the letter
to the graphologist

125
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:30,603
The very particular shape
of the letters...

126
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,178
do you follow me?

127
00:16:32,882 --> 00:16:39,082
indicates in this man a very
strong and pathological sexuality

128
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:49,420
Some of the broken letters

129
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:54,558
reveal an actor's personality

130
00:16:54,737 --> 00:17:02,041
which can be indolent
or even lazy

131
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:15,489
ln the whole, the handwriting
shows clear signs of insanity

132
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:23,929
Yes, lnspector, certainly.
You and your men are very good

133
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,160
But, nevertheless, results,
we must have results

134
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:29,827
Results!

135
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:37,678
Minister, my men are only
getting 12 hours sleep a week

136
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:41,714
as well as searches
on the spot, Minister

137
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:46,650
They start their shift
already tired

138
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:52,187
Don't forget, this job
is nervously trying

139
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:56,491
especially when the success
rate is so low

140
00:17:56,765 --> 00:18:00,223
The homicide officers work
restlessly

141
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:04,702
They're always on alert

142
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:10,311
following any clue,
even the slightest one

143
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:13,312
that may lead us to our man

144
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:17,618
Minister, consider their findings
on the scene of the crime

145
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:26,022
We find, for instance,
behind a hedge

146
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:31,997
a little white paper bag

147
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:36,096
Clearly it held the candy

148
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:45,242
ln a corner, we found some
crumbs and some sugar grains

149
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:50,075
Within a radius of 2 kilometers,
we have searched

150
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:54,450
in all the candy shops to find out
where the bag came from

151
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:56,252
But in vain

152
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:01,227
Every day the search widens

153
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:12,741
but, of course, no one
remembers anything

154
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:22,941
Nevertheless, we keep on
searching, getting nowhere

155
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:31,822
without much hope of
finding a solution. Our men...

156
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:36,863
What good is that?
l know you're trying

157
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:44,529
but an unknown murderer
terrorizes the town

158
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:47,972
A town of four million
and your police are failing

159
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:58,147
Minister, you don't seem to
understand the difficulties

160
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:05,417
Only on the way home
of the missing child

161
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:12,191
we got fifteen different
testimonies

162
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:17,431
Just listen: ''Testimony 1478
in the Beckmann murder case...''

163
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:19,903
-You know nothing.
-More than you, Sir!

164
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:24,375
Gentlemen! Can't you agree
what color hat

165
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:29,245
that little girl wore
when you saw her?

166
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,744
Of course, lnspector, it was red

167
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,252
-lnspector, it was green.
-lt was a red hat!

168
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:35,856
lt was a green hat!

169
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:44,793
Stop! lt's hopeless.
Thank you, gentlemen

170
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:48,599
-Next witness.
-Of course, lnspector

171
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:53,572
if you listen
to a color-blind man!

172
00:20:53,776 --> 00:21:00,682
The police have investigated
over 1,500 clues

173
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,183
Documents fill 60 volumes.
We have all available men

174
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:10,692
We have systematically
combed all adjoining areas

175
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:14,590
Every thicket, every piece
of undergrowth, every bush

176
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:21,760
in every hole,
we might find something

177
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:27,507
We sent out police dogs.
The best trackers are on the scent

178
00:21:27,676 --> 00:21:31,476
to no avail.
Since the murderer's first crime

179
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:37,810
police have inspected all
the flop-houses every night

180
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:40,853
and checked the identity
of every vagrant

181
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:45,790
Such measures hurt our popularity
and make people nervous

182
00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:51,622
But we watch all railway stations
and raid the underworld hangouts

183
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:58,000
Despite all this, the police haven't
succeeded in finding anything

184
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:32,065
The police. Get back!

185
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:06,189
Let me go, you dirty bastard!
Let me go!

186
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:13,003
Please let me go, won't you?
You son of a bitch! Let go!

187
00:24:18,313 --> 00:24:20,941
Let her go, you filthy pig!

188
00:24:21,116 --> 00:24:22,344
Quiet! Quiet!

189
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,814
The head cop!

190
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:31,225
Quiet!
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

191
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:34,487
Police orders: nobody leaves.
Get your papers ready

192
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:53,137
Quiet! C'mon kids,
let's not be stupid

193
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:55,374
lt's Fatty Lohmann!

194
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:58,551
Loh-mann, Loh-mann, Loh-mann!

195
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,280
Loh-mann! Loh-mann!

196
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:09,192
Quiet! Quiet!

197
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,100
You'll wear yourselves out

198
00:25:13,235 --> 00:25:14,634
lt would be better if
you got the murderer

199
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:16,703
Yes! Much better!

200
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:23,037
Quiet! Be reasonable!

201
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:31,514
Spread out. All of you spread out.
C'mon, papers out!

202
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,150
-l haven't got any.
-Show me your papers

203
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:37,187
Please let me go, lnspector

204
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:43,492
Show me your papers

205
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:46,096
-l think we know each other.
-Yes, we do

206
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:48,929
To the headquarters!

207
00:25:49,104 --> 00:25:50,867
With all this mess, not a client!

208
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:56,974
Don't make any trouble. No papers
and you go to headquarters

209
00:25:57,145 --> 00:26:00,205
l am innocent

210
00:26:00,449 --> 00:26:02,007
Don't talk nonsense

211
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:07,451
Quiet! Show me your papers

212
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:11,990
Don't push. lt's everybody's turn

213
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:18,324
-Have you got your papers?
-l can't go around

214
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,832
with my birth certificate.
That's asking too much

215
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:23,300
-Don't mess with me.
-That's asking too much, lnspector

216
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:24,837
Headquarters for you

217
00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:26,768
Look here, it's disgusting

218
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:22,153
Poor workmanship, old boy.
You've had it. To headquarters

219
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:24,896
Better luck next time, Willie

220
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:26,055
Shut your face!

221
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:27,928
Next

222
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:32,132
Fancy boy

223
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:50,924
What's wrong?

224
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:54,559
Pop Lohmann's got him

225
00:27:57,499 --> 00:28:00,127
''Unsolved burglary at a fur shop.''

226
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:05,973
Well, l guess l'd better
take you down to headquarters

227
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:09,838
But... my papers are in order

228
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:10,978
Next

229
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:13,878
No luck, huh?

230
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:19,220
Papers

231
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:20,352
l have none

232
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:21,913
Headquarters

233
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,288
No luck

234
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,986
Next, come on, let's go

235
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:44,595
This is wrecking our business,
Sarge, trouble every night

236
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:47,674
You can't have ten minutes
peace anymore. Give us a break!

237
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:54,042
lt's no joke for us either,
out every night

238
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:56,945
Of course, but you're
drivin' away my clientele

239
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:59,484
and the guy you're looking
for ain't here

240
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:04,853
Do you know how mad everyone
is about this guy who's causing

241
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:10,794
a raid every night? 'Specially
the girls. Sure, they solicit

242
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:18,565
but believe me, everyone
is a little mother at heart

243
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:24,609
l know a lot of crooks, get sort
of tender when they see kids

244
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:31,352
lf they catch that bastard
they'll wring his neck

245
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:33,679
Ready to go, Sarge?

246
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:35,280
Good night

247
00:30:46,234 --> 00:30:50,967
So it's the Crocodile tonight.
Two loads for the nick

248
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:59,410
What's keeping Schranker?

249
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,813
ls it three o'clock yet?

250
00:31:05,153 --> 00:31:06,415
l'll find out

251
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:16,992
Hello, the exact time, please.
Two minutes to three

252
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:18,256
Thank you

253
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:11,380
There are more police on
the street tonight than whores

254
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:15,353
Wherever you spit, cops

255
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:18,492
Even when you've got a broad,
they don't leave you alone

256
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:20,618
They've gone nuts. All they
think about is the murderer

257
00:32:20,962 --> 00:32:23,988
l have a little six-year-old and
every night l have to look under

258
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:28,092
the bed and in the closet to see
if the murderer is hiding there

259
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:33,266
You can't even do your job.
The police are everywhere

260
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:36,604
There's no privacy anymore.
l'm fed up with it

261
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:39,145
Tell us something new

262
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:47,152
What's keeping Schranker?

263
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:48,788
Maybe he's been caught

264
00:32:49,991 --> 00:32:56,658
Not him. He did a bank job in
London. Scotland Yard trapped him

265
00:32:57,165 --> 00:33:04,571
There he was, hands up, back to
the wall, millions of cops around

266
00:33:04,772 --> 00:33:09,436
two seconds later there were
two corpses and he'd beat it!

267
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:11,545
The best man between
Berlin and San Francisco

268
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:15,480
Six years they've looked and they
haven't caught him yet

269
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,312
Haven't caught him yet,
but dogs can kill wolves

270
00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:19,453
Shut up

271
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:36,360
The suspense is killing me.
He's always right on time

272
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:41,264
God be praised!

273
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:42,534
At last!

274
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:46,140
Well, hello! You've finally come.
Good afternoon

275
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:48,579
Are you crazy? Close the curtains

276
00:34:11,372 --> 00:34:13,840
Gentlemen, the meeting
can now begin

277
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:16,840
According to regulations,
l confirm that the leadership of

278
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:19,639
every organization in
our union is represented

279
00:34:19,814 --> 00:34:23,648
l assume you are all authorized
to vote on behalf of your members

280
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:28,686
Good. Let's not be held up
by procedure

281
00:34:28,856 --> 00:34:34,658
We all know why we are here.
Some non-member is screwing up

282
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:42,962
our affairs. Daily raids by
the police for the child murderer

283
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:48,775
interfere with our business.
We can't put up

284
00:34:48,943 --> 00:34:57,976
with this pressure any longer
in every hotel, cafe or pad

285
00:34:58,886 --> 00:35:02,117
This state of affairs must not
be allowed to continue

286
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:05,884
We have to put things right
again or we'll all be ruined

287
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:13,726
Our funds are exhausted.
We'll have to use money allocated

288
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:21,967
for our colleagues' wives who
are being ''hosted'' by the state

289
00:35:22,343 --> 00:35:24,834
Furthermore, our reputation
is suffering

290
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:27,573
Gentlemen, the cops are looking
for the murderer in our ranks!

291
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:32,679
When l run into a cop while on
business, he knows the risk

292
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:37,881
and so do l. lf one of us dies,
OK, that's a risk one takes

293
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:42,462
lt can happen. But you and l are
not on the level of this murderer

294
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,689
Absolutely!

295
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:47,323
We are doing our job,
we have to make a living

296
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:50,960
But this monster has no right
to live. He must disappear!

297
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:53,869
He must be eliminated,
without pity, without scruples

298
00:35:57,812 --> 00:36:03,978
Gentlemen, our members have
to carry on normal business

299
00:36:04,152 --> 00:36:08,748
without being handicapped
by nervous policemen

300
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:14,653
l ask you for advice

301
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:21,992
l suggest a closer watch on
lD cards, systematic searches

302
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,833
and police raids. More raids,
and much tougher ones

303
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:32,476
Spies. We need spies among
the police to give us warnings

304
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:35,376
The girls must take a little more
notice of the cops

305
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,075
We get into trouble because one
of the girls has talked too much

306
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:41,450
to her cop boyfriend. Now the girls
have to tell us what gives

307
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:55,834
We must be allowed to search
any house, apartment, back yard

308
00:36:56,003 --> 00:36:59,495
in order to find a clue

309
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:09,340
We have contacts, we have to make
a statement to the press

310
00:37:09,817 --> 00:37:17,690
we have to tell them that
we condemn the bastard too

311
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:23,355
We should make it known that
he isn't in the underworld

312
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:35,841
l'm sure it's a man who looks
like he wouldn't hurt a fly

313
00:37:36,711 --> 00:37:40,807
ln his normal state, he might
even play marbles with the kids

314
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:53,190
or cards with his wife.
Otherwise, murderers like Grossmann

315
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:57,024
or Haarmann couldn't live
for years like they did

316
00:37:57,231 --> 00:38:00,462
without their neighbors
suspecting them at all

317
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:04,867
We have to get that across
to the public. They must help

318
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:11,010
Don't talk to me about the
public helping. lt disgusts me

319
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:14,046
just to hear them talk.
Excuse me, Chief!

320
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:23,156
But it's the truth. Christ! Help
from the public brings no clues!

321
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:28,491
Just a pile of letters with
the most incredible accusations!

322
00:38:28,696 --> 00:38:29,663
Quite true

323
00:38:30,198 --> 00:38:34,362
Calls to the police the moment
a garbage man crosses a yard!

324
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:41,001
But when we need accurate
information, they can't remember!

325
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:48,547
They've seen nothing. That's
help from the public for you

326
00:38:49,984 --> 00:38:56,150
You're exaggerating
a little, Lohmann

327
00:38:56,624 --> 00:38:58,990
No, he isn't

328
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,792
Most of the people
don't feel concerned

329
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:10,262
The majority of them
doesn't realize

330
00:39:10,438 --> 00:39:18,675
that a child disappearance
is also their problem

331
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:30,023
l've got an idea! Let's get
one of those guys, a telepath

332
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:33,490
one who finds handkerchiefs and
pocketbooks that have been hidden

333
00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:36,459
l don't think the reward is enough

334
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:42,064
Chief, we have to offer a real
fortune for the murderer

335
00:39:42,236 --> 00:39:44,101
None of this is getting
us anywhere

336
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:47,736
-That won't do any good.
-What's your idea?

337
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:50,605
Well, we just can't wait until the
police decide to arrest the fellow

338
00:39:53,614 --> 00:40:01,953
The difficulty in solving crimes
like this comes from the fact

339
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:07,220
that the criminal and the victim
are connected only by chance

340
00:40:07,962 --> 00:40:11,591
An instantaneous impulse
is the killer's only motive

341
00:40:11,832 --> 00:40:15,598
We find the victim, we
identify him, then we find out

342
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:24,041
when he was last seen.
Then, nothing more

343
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,608
Children disappear

344
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:33,650
and you know what state
we find them in

345
00:40:37,658 --> 00:40:42,152
if we find them

346
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:51,768
And the killer... as we know,
in this kind of crime

347
00:40:51,939 --> 00:40:55,375
never leaves a mark behind

348
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:59,735
This is what makes our job so hard
and our success so rare

349
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:03,145
The police have been looking
for eight months

350
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:07,550
Now, they'll catch him
only by luck

351
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:11,158
-We can't wait for that.
-We'll be ruined before then

352
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:12,792
Then what will we do?

353
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,203
We'll have to catch him ourselves

354
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:40,982
Yes! We must. That's it

355
00:41:42,256 --> 00:41:50,755
There is still one possible way!
The guilty man must have

356
00:41:50,965 --> 00:42:00,306
a record somewhere. A man
that disturbed must have come

357
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:09,405
upon the law before. We've
got to contact every clinic

358
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:17,922
every prison, every asylum.
We'll have to make inquiries

359
00:42:18,092 --> 00:42:24,258
about everyone freed as harmless
but with the same

360
00:42:24,465 --> 00:42:32,497
pathological condition
as the killer

361
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:41,444
Every square foot must
be permanently watched

362
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:45,016
From now on, no child takes a
step without us being warned

363
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:47,586
OK, but how do we do it?

364
00:42:47,722 --> 00:42:51,249
There must be people who can
go everywhere, not be noticed

365
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:54,326
who can follow children
without arousing suspicion

366
00:42:54,495 --> 00:42:58,363
who can follow children
right up to their front doors

367
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:03,128
People no one would suspect

368
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:07,604
But who? People like that don't
exist. Who could do it? Who?

369
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:15,541
The beggars.
The beggars' union can do it

370
00:43:55,489 --> 00:44:03,624
-Sausage going up.
-God! This cheese smells good

371
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:10,798
That finishes you

372
00:44:20,815 --> 00:44:22,783
Stop snoring!
You'll wake up the lice

373
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:38,155
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16

374
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:25,139
Now we must take the back yards

375
00:45:25,613 --> 00:45:29,515
Yes, from number 1 to 88

376
00:45:33,354 --> 00:45:34,378
Next

377
00:45:39,894 --> 00:45:43,796
You are responsible for the
courtyards in every block, 1 to 88

378
00:45:43,964 --> 00:45:44,862
Right!

379
00:45:45,266 --> 00:45:51,762
-What's next?
-89 to 196 High Street

380
00:45:51,939 --> 00:46:01,075
89 to 196 High Street.
What's your union number?

381
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:04,445
3, 7, 95, Emil Dustermann

382
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:14,753
3, 7, 95, Dustermann, Emil

383
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:23,461
There you are, Emil.
Maybe you'll win 15,000

384
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:27,997
Touch wood!

385
00:47:09,883 --> 00:47:12,374
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

386
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:16,583
Thank you

387
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:12,907
''When searching homes, we must
look for any clue which could

388
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,844
establish where the murderer's
letter to the papers originated

389
00:48:16,016 --> 00:48:18,507
lf there is an old wooden table,
if there is a red pencil

390
00:48:18,685 --> 00:48:22,416
or writing paper of the same type.
lnquiries must be discreet.''

391
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:23,578
ldiot

392
00:48:39,006 --> 00:48:44,444
And here's a list of mental
patients who have been let out

393
00:48:44,611 --> 00:48:48,604
as cured or harmless
in the last five years

394
00:48:49,316 --> 00:48:52,649
Reports from every institute,
private and public

395
00:49:05,032 --> 00:49:09,298
And that's a list
of their present addresses

396
00:49:45,105 --> 00:49:46,072
Good morning

397
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:48,001
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

398
00:49:48,242 --> 00:49:49,334
What?

399
00:49:49,843 --> 00:49:52,277
Does Mr. Beckert live here?

400
00:49:52,446 --> 00:49:55,677
l'm afraid l can't hear you.
l'm a bit hard of hearing

401
00:49:55,883 --> 00:49:59,250
As if l couldn't tell.
Does Mr. Beckert live here?

402
00:50:00,554 --> 00:50:04,854
Oh, Mr. Beckert... Yes...
But he has just gone out

403
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:08,128
Too bad, l wanted to see him

404
00:50:09,163 --> 00:50:11,427
l'm from the lncome Tax office

405
00:50:11,665 --> 00:50:16,796
Oh, good God! Tax people?
Would you like to wait?

406
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,699
Yes, thank you

407
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,478
-Please take a seat.
-Thank you

408
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:45,195
Like something to read?

409
00:50:45,365 --> 00:50:46,354
Thank you. You're most kind

410
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:54,469
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler, does
Mr. Beckert take this paper?

411
00:50:54,641 --> 00:50:57,906
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine

412
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:07,391
Mom! l was looking for you

413
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:11,970
You don't have to do this!
You know why

414
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,677
Good evening.
What would you like?

415
00:54:58,885 --> 00:55:00,512
Coffee

416
00:55:01,288 --> 00:55:03,882
No... a vermouth... no, a brandy

417
00:55:30,217 --> 00:55:31,445
There you are

418
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,050
Another one

419
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:13,718
The bill!

420
00:56:14,528 --> 00:56:17,088
Two brandies. 1.65, please

421
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,526
Thank you very much

422
00:56:27,807 --> 00:56:31,675
Number 24: Beckert.
He does not take the Courier

423
00:56:31,845 --> 00:56:36,373
A walnut table with a cloth.
No red pencil or traces of one

424
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:41,214
No writing paper. ln the waste
basket, a printed ad and

425
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:44,915
a postcard with flowers
and ''Regards, Paul'' on it

426
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:47,651
but no address of sender.
An empty cigarette pack

427
00:56:47,827 --> 00:56:50,660
Ariston brand, a bag of candy
with the candy store name on it

428
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,825
Wait a moment...

429
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:02,302
Ariston, did you say?

430
00:57:05,946 --> 00:57:11,680
Ar-is-ton...

431
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:18,324
That rings a bell... Ariston

432
00:57:24,331 --> 00:57:29,997
Hello. Get me the file on
the Marga Perl murder. Hurry

433
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:33,765
Thank you very much

434
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:47,878
That's funny.
l've heard that before

435
00:57:51,057 --> 00:57:56,791
lt was... it was...

436
00:58:17,183 --> 00:58:18,844
Hey! Henry!

437
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:27,483
What is it?

438
00:58:28,995 --> 00:58:34,126
Listen a moment. Someone
whistling. Can you hear him?

439
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,329
There

440
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:44,769
He's just stopped. Did you see him,
the guy who was whistling?

441
00:58:44,978 --> 00:58:48,209
-Yes, l can still see him.
-Yes?

442
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:52,681
Yes. He's talking to a little
girl and walking her down the street

443
00:58:52,852 --> 00:58:56,413
-After him and don't let him go!
-But why?

444
00:58:56,589 --> 00:59:04,587
The day Elsie Beckmann was killed,
someone bought a balloon

445
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:07,392
He was with a little girl

446
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:16,168
and he whistled just like that!

447
01:00:45,398 --> 01:00:49,391
Damn it, man! Are you crazy
throwing peels on the ground?

448
01:00:49,803 --> 01:00:52,237
l might have broken my neck!
Unbelievable

449
01:00:52,539 --> 01:00:57,169
l should report you to the police,
you're a menace to the public

450
01:00:59,546 --> 01:01:00,535
Uncle

451
01:01:14,994 --> 01:01:19,931
There! That's it. They found
three cigarettes butts

452
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:24,365
at the scene of the crime.
Aristons!

453
01:01:25,972 --> 01:01:32,070
Yes, the cigarettes are the same,
but there's no old wooden table

454
01:01:33,413 --> 01:01:41,218
Of course, he could have written
that letter somewhere else

455
01:01:43,957 --> 01:01:47,791
Heavens, the windowsill!

456
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,775
You're right

457
01:02:05,411 --> 01:02:07,174
Just a minute

458
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:16,320
A red pencil!

459
01:02:19,092 --> 01:02:24,553
God, at last we're getting
somewhere

460
01:02:25,131 --> 01:02:30,694
Yes, yes, what?
They have his trial!

461
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:35,363
-Have they found him?
-The beggars found him

462
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:38,203
-He was talking to a little girl.
-They put a mark on him

463
01:02:38,378 --> 01:02:41,040
Can't you be quiet?
What's that?

464
01:02:41,915 --> 01:02:45,544
They are following the sign.
He isn't out of sight for a second

465
01:02:47,654 --> 01:02:49,485
He's being watched

466
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:59,217
-Uncle.
-What is it?

467
01:03:59,392 --> 01:04:01,121
You're all dirty

468
01:04:01,694 --> 01:04:02,661
Where?

469
01:04:03,162 --> 01:04:04,789
There, on your shoulder

470
01:04:09,035 --> 01:04:11,094
Here, l'll wipe it off

471
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:20,875
-What's the matter?
-Come on, let's go

472
01:05:53,072 --> 01:05:55,597
He hasn't come out yet
or we would have seen him

473
01:05:55,775 --> 01:05:58,869
He must be in the courtyard,
he didn't come out this way

474
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:00,342
He must be somewhere

475
01:06:05,284 --> 01:06:08,685
Maybe he's hiding
inside the building

476
01:06:28,774 --> 01:06:29,604
Closing time!

477
01:06:30,009 --> 01:06:32,603
He mustn't get out
with everyone leaving

478
01:06:32,778 --> 01:06:34,746
Christ! Here come
the first ones already

479
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:36,608
Let's go out in the street

480
01:06:36,782 --> 01:06:38,181
Keep a sharp lookout

481
01:07:03,276 --> 01:07:07,804
Turn off the light or he'll suspect
something when he comes back

482
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:14,475
What time is it?

483
01:07:16,422 --> 01:07:17,650
Nearly 6:30

484
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:41,904
He must still be in the building,
anyway, he didn't come out

485
01:07:43,149 --> 01:07:51,579
Ok, Ok, yes... No, just a moment

486
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:55,452
The beggars have gone for more
help to search the whole area

487
01:07:55,695 --> 01:07:57,754
The murderer must still be
in the building

488
01:08:03,803 --> 01:08:05,236
What sort of place is it?

489
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:15,213
Nothing but offices. l don't
know what's in the cellar

490
01:08:16,215 --> 01:08:19,116
There's a branch of the savings
bank on the ground floor

491
01:08:19,285 --> 01:08:23,551
and from the first to the fifth,
nothing but offices

492
01:08:23,723 --> 01:08:25,884
above that are lofts

493
01:08:31,364 --> 01:08:32,490
Look at that. lt ain't possible

494
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,060
Anyone there?

495
01:08:44,744 --> 01:08:46,109
Anyone there?

496
01:09:04,997 --> 01:09:08,228
What next? Anyone there?

497
01:09:19,211 --> 01:09:25,377
Damn carelessness,
all that trouble for one door

498
01:09:46,772 --> 01:09:49,263
Yes, good

499
01:09:49,442 --> 01:09:52,070
Looks like that guy
is really cornered now

500
01:09:52,244 --> 01:09:54,235
l think we should tip off
the cops right away

501
01:09:54,413 --> 01:09:56,847
-l agree.
-Now then, listen carefully

502
01:09:57,583 --> 01:10:01,747
Hello. Just a moment. What?
Ok, call me right back

503
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:03,445
What is it? What's the matter?

504
01:10:03,622 --> 01:10:05,852
Are you crazy or something?

505
01:10:06,025 --> 01:10:08,255
The police? No. We're going
to get that guy ourselves

506
01:10:08,828 --> 01:10:10,227
Listen... now, the time is

507
01:10:12,098 --> 01:10:12,928
8:00

508
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:18,467
Good. Then at 9:00, 10:00, 11:00!

509
01:10:42,828 --> 01:10:45,991
Good evening. Did you know
your gates are not closed?

510
01:10:46,265 --> 01:10:48,825
What? But that's impossible!

511
01:10:49,802 --> 01:10:52,669
l've only just... But it is

512
01:10:55,474 --> 01:10:57,465
Open up, and no noise!

513
01:10:58,577 --> 01:11:00,408
Are you going to open up?

514
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,008
Come on, get it open

515
01:11:03,182 --> 01:11:04,149
Get a move on!

516
01:11:32,878 --> 01:11:34,778
How many watchmen are
there in the building?

517
01:11:38,317 --> 01:11:40,376
Ok, so you don't want to answer?

518
01:12:17,456 --> 01:12:19,617
There are two watchmen
on their rounds

519
01:12:43,249 --> 01:12:44,773
Bloody hell!

520
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,782
Damn it

521
01:13:10,776 --> 01:13:12,539
Shit!

522
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:12,936
Careful with the lights.
And don't walk like elephants

523
01:14:13,672 --> 01:14:15,537
-What's the story?
-He isn't in the basement.

524
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:17,801
We went through it
and found nothing

525
01:14:18,477 --> 01:14:20,945
Friede and Auguste are still
going through the boiler rooms

526
01:14:21,914 --> 01:14:22,881
Wait

527
01:14:23,082 --> 01:14:24,379
That's the last one

528
01:14:24,817 --> 01:14:26,478
Go up and join Emile.
He needs help

529
01:14:26,652 --> 01:14:27,448
Go on, get a move on!

530
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,725
Schranker sent me

531
01:14:36,128 --> 01:14:39,393
Good. Listen carefully

532
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:43,767
lt's a new type of time switch

533
01:14:45,004 --> 01:14:48,963
Here's a general plan here.
lf the time switches aren't set

534
01:14:49,141 --> 01:14:53,771
they automatically go off at the
nearest police station. Get it?

535
01:14:56,882 --> 01:14:58,213
Have you got it?

536
01:14:58,917 --> 01:15:00,282
What do you think l am,
some kind of a nut?

537
01:15:03,088 --> 01:15:06,421
-He isn't in the boiler room.
-Fine

538
01:15:06,825 --> 01:15:08,690
We moved all the coal

539
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:15,593
Are you nuts?

540
01:15:16,568 --> 01:15:21,301
What if the door is wired up?
Want to get the police here?

541
01:15:22,675 --> 01:15:26,668
Well, we have to get in if we're
going to search the whole place

542
01:15:26,879 --> 01:15:30,610
But not by the door, you ass!
Use the office on the floor above

543
01:15:30,783 --> 01:15:31,943
Go through the ceiling

544
01:16:15,394 --> 01:16:17,225
Right, let's go

545
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,240
Hey! What's up?

546
01:17:10,849 --> 01:17:13,477
Hey! Answer me. What's happening?
Paul - tell us

547
01:17:13,652 --> 01:17:15,085
What's going on?

548
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,051
l heard some banging!

549
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:19,214
-What did you say?
-What's the hurry?

550
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:30,463
l must see Schranker!

551
01:17:31,703 --> 01:17:36,834
He's in the attic! l heard him
knocking. He's in the attic!

552
01:17:52,424 --> 01:17:53,721
Keep quiet

553
01:18:42,441 --> 01:18:43,874
Get on with it, then

554
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:45,168
He must be there

555
01:18:46,812 --> 01:18:48,143
There's the switch

556
01:18:50,115 --> 01:18:51,412
Force the locks

557
01:18:57,022 --> 01:18:58,614
Come on. Hurry up!

558
01:19:05,597 --> 01:19:09,055
l've got him.
He's in the attic

559
01:19:09,234 --> 01:19:11,498
l heard someone hammer
l told Schranker immediately

560
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:14,468
He's up there with 8 men.
They'll get him any moment

561
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,870
l just came down to tell you

562
01:19:17,242 --> 01:19:20,268
lf l hadn't been alert, we'd
have looked for him for hours

563
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:21,309
Look out! The watchman!

564
01:19:26,752 --> 01:19:29,380
3... 1... 4

565
01:19:29,988 --> 01:19:31,250
314

566
01:19:42,367 --> 01:19:44,631
Let's get out of here!

567
01:19:44,803 --> 01:19:49,137
The cops will be here any
moment. The watchman rung in

568
01:19:49,308 --> 01:19:51,242
Let's get out of here!

569
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:57,979
Stop! Quiet! We've got
5 more minutes and 6 more

570
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:00,880
compartments to search. Carry on.
Get on with it. Only hurry!

571
01:20:01,053 --> 01:20:02,884
Out of the way.
You can't do it that way

572
01:20:10,963 --> 01:20:12,089
He's not in here

573
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:13,094
Next door!

574
01:20:13,565 --> 01:20:14,930
Come on. Quicker

575
01:20:20,405 --> 01:20:21,599
Not here either

576
01:20:21,807 --> 01:20:23,069
Come on, keep it up! Next door

577
01:20:29,548 --> 01:20:31,573
Quick! We've only got
about 3 minutes left

578
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,944
Hurry up! Quickly!

579
01:20:34,386 --> 01:20:37,412
This one hasn't got a padlock,
he must be here. Go on, open it!

580
01:20:37,589 --> 01:20:40,057
lt's locked from the inside,
let me do it!

581
01:20:40,225 --> 01:20:41,749
Hurry up, only one minute left!

582
01:20:45,864 --> 01:20:48,332
Here he is, here he is,
the dirty bastard!

583
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:51,802
Get going, hurry up -
Everybody out!

584
01:20:53,905 --> 01:20:58,467
Go on - move!
Hurry up, quickly!

585
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,775
Christ! Get out while
you can, you fool!

586
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:08,177
-Anybody left?
-A few up top, they're on the way

587
01:21:09,955 --> 01:21:12,082
No reason for you to wait for them.
With or without that guy

588
01:21:13,158 --> 01:21:15,683
lt doesn't matter, get away.
What are they up to? Christ!

589
01:21:16,728 --> 01:21:19,424
Bloody hell! At last! Thank God!

590
01:21:57,335 --> 01:22:03,740
Hey! He's not down here.
Who's pulled up the ladder?

591
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:08,575
Who's pulled up the ladder?

592
01:22:11,049 --> 01:22:11,947
Bunch of morons

593
01:22:27,732 --> 01:22:28,596
Hello

594
01:22:28,934 --> 01:22:30,231
Hands up

595
01:22:30,735 --> 01:22:34,364
How can l put my hands up when
l'm trying to hang onto the ladder?

596
01:22:34,606 --> 01:22:35,664
Get out of there

597
01:22:46,151 --> 01:22:48,085
For once, l'm innocent

598
01:22:49,488 --> 01:22:50,921
As a newborn babe

599
01:22:55,427 --> 01:23:00,956
This will surprise you, Franz,
but l believe you

600
01:23:03,969 --> 01:23:09,066
Well, then everything
is in order. l can leave then

601
01:23:09,307 --> 01:23:10,865
One minute

602
01:23:14,012 --> 01:23:15,104
Cigarette?

603
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:16,940
Oh, boy

604
01:23:29,027 --> 01:23:31,120
l'll take your word for it

605
01:23:32,731 --> 01:23:39,102
On condition you tell me

606
01:23:40,906 --> 01:23:47,641
who was the man you were
looking for and found there?

607
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:53,674
l don't understand, lnspector.
A man, you said?

608
01:23:55,387 --> 01:23:59,847
l know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake

609
01:24:00,392 --> 01:24:04,488
l know nothing, nothing at all

610
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:11,926
Of course. Only l don't understand
why you are covering up

611
01:24:12,137 --> 01:24:18,042
for the gang who left you
in the lurch. Funny friends!

612
01:24:18,276 --> 01:24:22,872
Leaving you right in
it and running off. Bah!

613
01:24:26,117 --> 01:24:30,247
That won't wash with me,
lnspector

614
01:25:04,222 --> 01:25:05,985
After all, l'm not risking
very much

615
01:25:06,925 --> 01:25:11,487
Maybe a little bit of damage.
But nothing was stolen

616
01:25:11,663 --> 01:25:15,929
Of course, something was stolen.
ln fact, a good deal

617
01:25:16,101 --> 01:25:21,801
What? Stolen? How much?

618
01:25:22,207 --> 01:25:25,176
lf you talk, l'll tell you

619
01:25:26,311 --> 01:25:28,802
l've already told you,
l don't know anything

620
01:25:31,383 --> 01:25:43,159
All right. Well, think about it.
lt's amazing what one remembers

621
01:25:44,562 --> 01:25:51,968
when one is left alone
for an hour or two

622
01:25:54,205 --> 01:25:54,967
Take him away!

623
01:26:11,556 --> 01:26:13,353
Send the night watchman in here

624
01:26:16,861 --> 01:26:18,795
Get the watchman Damowitz

625
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:26,759
Sit down

626
01:26:29,507 --> 01:26:35,104
Now then, you said in your
statement - Listen carefully

627
01:26:35,313 --> 01:26:38,043
You may have to repeat it
under oath

628
01:26:41,052 --> 01:26:42,417
You clearly heard

629
01:26:43,288 --> 01:26:47,622
one of the burglars say to another,
''we've found him

630
01:26:48,093 --> 01:26:51,460
l've discovered the guy.
He's in the attic.'' ls that correct?

631
01:26:52,263 --> 01:27:01,331
Yes, lnspector. Yes, l'll swear
to whatever you want

632
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:09,002
Right. You may go home now.
But please be ready to testify

633
01:27:09,547 --> 01:27:15,315
Of course, lnspector.
Good day, lnspector

634
01:27:31,236 --> 01:27:34,228
Tell me, is lnspector Lohmann
in the building?

635
01:27:35,673 --> 01:27:41,111
He's talking to someone? No,
it doesn't matter. l'll come up

636
01:27:44,449 --> 01:27:53,221
What? Good. Hasn't come in yet.
You're watching Mrs. Winkler?

637
01:27:56,327 --> 01:27:57,589
Come in

638
01:28:04,002 --> 01:28:06,470
We've surrounded the whole block

639
01:28:06,638 --> 01:28:08,936
lf he wanted to get home,
he'd run into us

640
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:11,839
Now you have to wait

641
01:28:12,644 --> 01:28:14,908
l'll be in my office
if you have some news

642
01:28:20,084 --> 01:28:20,948
Hell...

643
01:28:27,892 --> 01:28:28,984
What do you want?

644
01:28:29,894 --> 01:28:34,763
l wanted to ask you a favor

645
01:28:38,603 --> 01:28:40,036
Disgusting

646
01:28:40,839 --> 01:28:43,569
l wanted to ask you

647
01:28:43,741 --> 01:28:46,005
Anyway, read a bit of that

648
01:28:52,851 --> 01:28:54,648
-Reports?
-Yes

649
01:28:55,353 --> 01:28:57,344
Burglary in an office block

650
01:29:04,863 --> 01:29:06,023
Bennostrasse?

651
01:29:07,031 --> 01:29:08,726
That's a very quiet neighborhood

652
01:29:10,602 --> 01:29:12,900
Perhaps it's not as quiet
as all that

653
01:29:14,839 --> 01:29:16,636
Hell, this is becoming serious

654
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,878
Did they intend to empty
the whole place, then?

655
01:29:29,554 --> 01:29:32,387
What can they have been
looking for in the coal?

656
01:29:34,192 --> 01:29:36,990
Look at that. lt's incredible

657
01:29:40,031 --> 01:29:42,022
Good Lord!

658
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:47,031
This is madness!

659
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:55,142
Ah, now it makes sense.
They were after the safe

660
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,311
Good God! What's it all about?

661
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:01,347
l don't understand it at all

662
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:06,852
They haven't even attacked
that one. Are they all crazy?

663
01:30:09,594 --> 01:30:11,528
Well, l'll be damned!

664
01:30:12,063 --> 01:30:18,935
Well, what have you got to say?
Nothing stolen, but a man taken

665
01:30:20,038 --> 01:30:20,834
Fantastic!

666
01:30:21,973 --> 01:30:25,033
And Franz the burglar
was arrested. lsn't talking

667
01:30:25,243 --> 01:30:28,838
Frightened, evidently.
Actually, l know him well

668
01:30:29,013 --> 01:30:31,481
He's one who'd rather jump
from the fifth floor

669
01:30:31,649 --> 01:30:33,276
than get mixed up in a murder

670
01:30:35,687 --> 01:30:40,886
Could we set a trap for him?

671
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:45,320
Could you help me, Lohmann?

672
01:30:49,167 --> 01:30:52,728
l see what you're getting at

673
01:30:55,173 --> 01:30:58,267
Let's take a look at this Franz

674
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,212
You're wanted for questioning

675
01:31:05,216 --> 01:31:09,846
What? Four people for me?

676
01:31:10,021 --> 01:31:11,010
Come on

677
01:31:34,112 --> 01:31:40,813
The murder squad?
lnspector Karl Lohmann

678
01:31:46,824 --> 01:31:51,989
What do you want with me?
What's the murder squad want?

679
01:32:03,408 --> 01:32:08,436
Yes, old boy, your case has been
passed over to me now

680
01:32:10,081 --> 01:32:17,647
But why? What for?

681
01:32:20,358 --> 01:32:23,794
You did your work
a little too well

682
01:32:30,134 --> 01:32:32,193
One of the watchmen

683
01:32:42,213 --> 01:32:43,441
Dead?

684
01:32:48,453 --> 01:32:53,550
Planning and assisting with a
murder. lt's a bad show, Franz

685
01:32:53,758 --> 01:32:58,320
l can't go on with it. l don't
want to have anything to do with it

686
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:01,763
l'll tell you everything,
everything l know

687
01:33:02,767 --> 01:33:05,235
Very wise, but unfortunately
too late

688
01:33:05,403 --> 01:33:08,736
lnspector, it can't be too late...
Please, lnspector

689
01:33:08,906 --> 01:33:13,002
lt isn't possible! Listen,
l'm going to tell you everything

690
01:33:13,945 --> 01:33:17,381
Even who we were looking for
in that damn building

691
01:33:17,548 --> 01:33:18,480
Well, then

692
01:33:20,518 --> 01:33:21,780
The child murderer

693
01:33:31,763 --> 01:33:36,564
What? What? Who?

694
01:33:36,801 --> 01:33:39,167
The child murderer, lnspector

695
01:33:45,443 --> 01:33:46,637
Wait

696
01:34:05,329 --> 01:34:06,887
This had to happen to me!

697
01:34:10,935 --> 01:34:13,460
Of all people

698
01:34:21,479 --> 01:34:22,844
Sit down

699
01:34:27,318 --> 01:34:31,220
Now, we're going
to have a little talk

700
01:34:31,956 --> 01:34:33,753
lf you want to, lnspector

701
01:34:33,925 --> 01:34:38,089
And mind you, don't lie.
OK, let's start

702
01:34:39,096 --> 01:34:43,556
What have you do to with the
murderer, and where'd you take him?

703
01:34:46,938 --> 01:34:52,535
Well, lnspector, you know the old

704
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:55,178
distillery of Kuntz and Levy?

705
01:34:56,414 --> 01:35:00,783
-The one that went bankrupt?
-Yes. Since then

706
01:35:00,952 --> 01:35:04,479
the building's been abandoned
and nobody cares

707
01:35:41,025 --> 01:35:46,691
What do you want with me?
Let me go! Let me go!

708
01:35:46,864 --> 01:35:50,493
l've done nothing to you,
let me go, you swine!

709
01:35:50,668 --> 01:35:51,896
Let me go!

710
01:35:54,305 --> 01:35:56,364
What do you bastards want with me?
What do you want?

711
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:29,297
Help!

712
01:36:29,974 --> 01:36:34,104
Help! Let me go. l want to
get out. Get me out of here

713
01:36:34,278 --> 01:36:35,939
Let me out!

714
01:36:38,549 --> 01:36:40,744
You will not get out of here

715
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:48,122
But gentlemen, l don't even
know what you want me for

716
01:36:48,326 --> 01:36:54,265
l beg you, set me free.
There must be some mistake

717
01:36:59,203 --> 01:37:06,609
No, no. No mistake.
lmpossible. There's no mistake

718
01:37:12,783 --> 01:37:16,116
No mistake

719
01:37:21,158 --> 01:37:25,857
Do you recognize it? lt's a
balloon like the one you gave

720
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:27,691
little Elsie Beckmann!

721
01:37:28,032 --> 01:37:29,795
A balloon like that

722
01:37:38,209 --> 01:37:40,473
Where did you bury little Martha?

723
01:37:46,283 --> 01:37:51,778
But l never...
l never even knew her

724
01:37:52,857 --> 01:37:55,826
You never knew her?

725
01:37:58,629 --> 01:37:59,960
And what about this one?

726
01:38:02,266 --> 01:38:04,131
And this one?

727
01:38:06,904 --> 01:38:08,166
You didn't know
this one either, huh?

728
01:38:09,507 --> 01:38:12,874
Stop him, stop him...
Don't let him get away

729
01:38:19,683 --> 01:38:21,548
Let me go!

730
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:46,005
You have no right
to treat me this way!

731
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:48,075
We'll show you what right we have!

732
01:38:48,279 --> 01:38:50,474
You have no right to hold me here

733
01:38:51,182 --> 01:38:54,015
Right? Someone like you
has no rights. Kill him!

734
01:38:54,185 --> 01:38:56,153
Yes, kill him!

735
01:38:57,588 --> 01:38:59,715
We must treat him like
a mad dog. Crush him!

736
01:39:11,335 --> 01:39:16,864
You talk of rights.
You will get your rights

737
01:39:17,942 --> 01:39:21,810
We are all law experts here

738
01:39:24,982 --> 01:39:27,473
from 6 weeks in Tegel prison

739
01:39:27,818 --> 01:39:30,514
to 15 years in Brandenburg

740
01:39:33,657 --> 01:39:39,789
You will get your rights,
you will even get a lawyer

741
01:39:41,632 --> 01:39:43,600
Everything will be done
according to the rule of law

742
01:39:44,368 --> 01:39:47,428
A lawyer? A lawyer?
l don't need a lawyer

743
01:39:47,605 --> 01:39:50,438
Who is accusing me?
You, maybe? You?

744
01:39:53,711 --> 01:39:58,375
Just a moment. lf l were
you, sir, l'd keep quiet

745
01:39:58,883 --> 01:40:02,478
Your life's at stake,
in case you didn't know it

746
01:40:03,721 --> 01:40:05,416
Who are you?

747
01:40:08,225 --> 01:40:12,889
l have the dubious honor
of being your defense counsel

748
01:40:14,198 --> 01:40:16,223
But l'm afraid it won't be
much use to you

749
01:40:18,669 --> 01:40:23,197
But, but... Do you want to kill
me? Murder me, just like that?

750
01:40:23,407 --> 01:40:26,433
We just want to render you harmless

751
01:40:28,212 --> 01:40:30,680
But you'll only be that way
when you are dead

752
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:33,248
But if you kill me,
it'll be cold-blooded murder!

753
01:40:36,587 --> 01:40:39,488
l demand that you hand me over
to the police

754
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,659
l demand to be handed over to
the jurisdiction of common law

755
01:40:50,968 --> 01:40:55,701
That would suit you, wouldn't it?
Then you'll invoke paragraph 51

756
01:40:55,873 --> 01:40:59,707
And spend the rest of your life
in an institution at state expense

757
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:04,538
And then you'd escape,
or else get a pardon, then

758
01:41:04,715 --> 01:41:07,912
there you are, free as air,
with a law-protected pass

759
01:41:08,085 --> 01:41:14,354
because of mental illness,
off again, chasing little girls

760
01:41:14,525 --> 01:41:16,425
We're not going
to let that happen

761
01:41:16,694 --> 01:41:19,219
We must make you powerless.
You must disappear

762
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:20,021
Yes, disappear!

763
01:41:20,264 --> 01:41:23,427
l can't help what l do

764
01:41:28,739 --> 01:41:35,406
l can't help it, l can't...

765
01:41:36,547 --> 01:41:42,076
The old story, we never
can help it in court

766
01:41:48,892 --> 01:41:52,726
What do you know about it?
Who are you anyway?

767
01:41:53,797 --> 01:42:06,141
Who are you? Criminals?
Are you proud of yourselves?

768
01:42:06,677 --> 01:42:11,307
Proud of breaking safes
or cheating at cards?

769
01:42:12,082 --> 01:42:16,280
Things you could just as
well keep your fingers off

770
01:42:16,587 --> 01:42:21,115
You wouldn't need to do all that
if you'd learn a proper trade

771
01:42:21,292 --> 01:42:25,422
or if you'd work. lf you
weren't a bunch of lazy bastards

772
01:42:25,596 --> 01:42:31,728
But l... l can't help myself!
l have no control over this

773
01:42:31,902 --> 01:42:39,570
this evil thing inside me,
the fire, the voices, the torment!

774
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:47,910
You mean to say
that you have to murder?

775
01:42:53,357 --> 01:42:58,795
lt's there all the time, driving
me out to wander the streets

776
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:09,205
following me, silently,
but l can feel it there

777
01:43:10,174 --> 01:43:18,980
lt's me, pursuing myself

778
01:43:19,616 --> 01:43:24,485
l want to escape, to escape
from myself! But it's impossible

779
01:43:24,655 --> 01:43:33,893
l can't escape. l have to obey it.
l have to run... endless streets

780
01:43:34,898 --> 01:43:37,992
l want to escape, to get away

781
01:43:38,802 --> 01:43:43,933
And l'm pursued by ghosts.
Ghosts of mothers

782
01:43:44,108 --> 01:43:47,202
And of those children...
They never leave me

783
01:43:47,745 --> 01:43:58,053
They are there, always there...
Always, except when l do it

784
01:43:59,456 --> 01:44:01,481
When l...

785
01:44:09,032 --> 01:44:11,023
Then l can't remember anything

786
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:21,710
And afterwards l see those posters
and read what l've done

787
01:44:22,913 --> 01:44:27,475
Did l do that? But l can't
remember anything about it

788
01:44:28,585 --> 01:44:33,887
But who will believe me?
Who knows what it's like to be me?

789
01:44:34,057 --> 01:44:42,624
How l'm forced to act... How l
must... Must... Don't want to

790
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,964
Must! Don't want to, but must!
And then... a voice screams

791
01:44:47,137 --> 01:44:49,401
l can't bear to hear it

792
01:44:50,007 --> 01:44:54,410
l can't go on

793
01:45:02,019 --> 01:45:06,319
The accused has said that
he cannot help himself

794
01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:14,159
That is to say, he has to murder.
As this is the case

795
01:45:14,331 --> 01:45:16,094
he has pronounced
his own death sentence

796
01:45:17,034 --> 01:45:23,963
Someone who admits to being
a compulsive murderer

797
01:45:24,141 --> 01:45:27,872
should be snuffed out,
like a candle

798
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:32,575
This man must be
wiped out, eliminated

799
01:45:32,816 --> 01:45:35,546
Perfect! Just what l think!

800
01:45:41,425 --> 01:45:43,985
l wish to speak

801
01:45:44,161 --> 01:45:45,788
The defense lawyer will speak

802
01:45:48,565 --> 01:45:56,529
Our very honorable president,
who is, l believe, wanted

803
01:45:56,707 --> 01:45:59,335
by the police for three murders -

804
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:00,807
That's got nothing to do with it

805
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:07,015
...claims that because my client
acts under an irresistible impulse

806
01:46:07,184 --> 01:46:09,015
he is condemned to death

807
01:46:09,186 --> 01:46:10,448
He is right!

808
01:46:11,588 --> 01:46:16,958
He is mistaken. Because it is
that very fact that clears him

809
01:46:17,127 --> 01:46:18,355
Just a minute, enough!

810
01:46:19,029 --> 01:46:20,394
Mad old drunk!

811
01:46:20,664 --> 01:46:26,193
ls this very obsession which
makes my client not responsible

812
01:46:26,637 --> 01:46:32,132
And nobody can be punished
for something he can't help

813
01:46:32,476 --> 01:46:34,569
-Ridiculous!
-Do you suggest

814
01:46:34,745 --> 01:46:36,679
that this brute should get off?

815
01:46:38,181 --> 01:46:42,584
l mean this man is sick.
A sick man should be handed over

816
01:46:42,753 --> 01:46:46,314
not to the executioner,
but to the doctor

817
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:48,387
Can you promise he'd be cured?

818
01:46:48,592 --> 01:46:50,423
What use are asylums, then?

819
01:46:50,761 --> 01:46:52,922
And what would happen
if he escaped?

820
01:46:53,096 --> 01:46:55,792
Yes. Or if they released him
as harmless? And what if

821
01:46:55,966 --> 01:46:59,367
the compulsion to kill returns?
Another man-hunt for months

822
01:46:59,570 --> 01:47:02,869
Paragraph 51 again. The asylum,
then another escape or release

823
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:07,409
Then the compulsion all over again,
and so on, and on

824
01:47:08,979 --> 01:47:16,385
No one can kill a man who isn't
responsible for his actions

825
01:47:16,553 --> 01:47:20,284
Not the state,
and certainly not you

826
01:47:21,858 --> 01:47:27,057
The state must see that this man
becomes harmless and no longer

827
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:30,996
is a danger to his fellow citizens

828
01:47:35,539 --> 01:47:39,771
You've never had children, huh?
So you haven't lost any

829
01:47:42,012 --> 01:47:50,579
But if you knew what it's like
to lose one... Go ask the parents!

830
01:47:51,521 --> 01:47:55,355
Ask them what those days
and nights were like when

831
01:47:55,525 --> 01:48:00,963
they didn't know what had happened.
And then when they finally knew

832
01:48:01,365 --> 01:48:03,458
-Ask the mothers!
-She's right!

833
01:48:06,803 --> 01:48:10,637
Do you think they'll have mercy?

834
01:48:11,074 --> 01:48:13,235
-She's right.
-l'll say she is

835
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:15,901
-No mercy! No pardon!
-Give the murderer to us

836
01:48:16,246 --> 01:48:18,009
Kill the beast!

837
01:48:18,181 --> 01:48:21,344
-Crush the brute!
-Kill him! Beat him!

838
01:48:28,925 --> 01:48:32,224
All that won't silence me

839
01:48:35,999 --> 01:48:42,495
l won't allow a crime to be
committed in my presence

840
01:48:43,206 --> 01:48:46,175
l demand that this man...

841
01:48:47,377 --> 01:48:53,009
that this man be granted
the protection of the law

842
01:48:54,117 --> 01:48:58,315
l demand that this man be
handed over to the police

843
01:48:58,588 --> 01:49:01,955
-To the police!
-Filthy stooge

844
01:49:28,585 --> 01:49:30,450
ln the name of the law

845
01:49:54,111 --> 01:49:55,305
ln the name of the people

846
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:00,416
This won't bring back
our children

847
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:14,590
We, too, should keep a closer
watch on our children
