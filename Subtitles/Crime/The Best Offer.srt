1
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,547
(man) Pinewood marriage chest
with groove joinery

2
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:55,419
and hand-forged hinges
in the shape of tulip buds.

3
00:00:57,514 --> 00:00:59,172
Walnut sideboard.

4
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:01,670
16th-century French decorations

5
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:04,761
of herms
and griffin-shaped cartouches.

6
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,011
Embellished deplorably
in the 19th century.

7
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:13,920
A pair of oak veneer cabinets
in the Flemish style.

8
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:15,755
Upper section with two doors,

9
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,213
featuring carved anthropomorphic
figures and caryatids.

10
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:27,803
Something wrong, Mr. Oldman?

11
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,709
Is it important?

12
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:52,881
lf you were kind enough
to let me have this as a gift,

13
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:55,046
I'd be delighted to accept.

14
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:57,214
I don't remember that.

15
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:59,344
It may look like mouldy wood,

16
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:01,634
but centuries ago,
beneath the mould,

17
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:04,128
there must have been a painting.

18
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,673
- Good evening. How are you?
- Very well.

19
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,676
The management
and staff of Styrorex

20
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,466
would like to offer our best wishes,
Mr. Oldman.

21
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:11,961
Happy birthday, Mr. Oldman.

22
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,971
This year, our chefs wish
to dedicate in your honour

23
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:17,675
an ancient recipe
of a Renaissance dessert

24
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:20,300
made of choux cream
and bitter almonds.

25
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,085
Enjoy.

26
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:34,968
- (woman) Most likely a rash.
- (woman 2) lt must be that.

27
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:55,088
Was it not to your taste,
Mr. Oldman?

28
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:58,878
Quite the contrary, but you see,
my birthday is tomorrow.

29
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:03,263
It is now 10:35pm
and I'm very superstitious.

30
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:05,054
Pretend I had accepted.

31
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:10,303
The day after tomorrow, then.

32
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:16,421
The director of the Vatican Museum
wants you to call him back.

33
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:19,299
The reliquary attributed to Cellini,
I presume.

34
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,215
The report on this is ready.

35
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:24,091
There's a pile of gifts.
What shall I do with them?

36
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:26,503
Send them to my house
except the mobile.

37
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,718
- Only one this year.
- (phone rings)

38
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,714
Good. Word's out that I hate them.

39
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,336
Unless you've changed your habits,
you'll have to answer that.

40
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:36,551
It's the first call on your birthday.

41
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:38,883
Tradition.

42
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:43,585
Hello.

43
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:46,050
(woman) I have no wish
to waste your time.

44
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,877
- Who's speaking?
- It's me, Claire Ibbetson.

45
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,678
Please don't hang up on me.

46
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:53,631
You're Mr. Oldman's secretary,
aren't you?

47
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:56,376
You can speak to me.
It makes no difference.

48
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:59,803
You see, I... I don't know anybody.
I'm on my own.

49
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:02,674
I'm sorry, Miss lbbetson,
this is not a helpline.

50
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:04,884
I'm not explaining myself very well.

51
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,626
I'm not in the habit
of speaking to people much.

52
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:10,507
That's a considerable stroke
of good fortune.

53
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,382
- Talking to people is perilous.
- I'm desperate...

54
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:15,960
You made the call
so you're running the risk.

55
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,674
It's about the furniture
of my parents' villa.

56
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:21,880
They... about a year ago.

57
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:24,176
- You see?
- I understand.

58
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,757
An estate of great...

59
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,466
I've always heard it referred to
as being of...

60
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,012
Extremely valuable.

61
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,847
Very rare pieces,
including paintings.

62
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,716
Unfortunately,
I have no photographs.

63
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,050
So what?

64
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:40,753
To be honest, I haven't decided yet,
but I would like to have a...

65
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,300
Oh, I'm out of my depth.
What's the word?

66
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:45,509
- Valuation.
- Exactly.

67
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,046
That is why I asked
to speak to Mr. Oldman.

68
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:52,340
Does Mr. Oldman have the pleasure
of knowing you?

69
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:55,216
Oh, no, not at all.
He doesn't know me.

70
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,260
But... but I know a lot about him.

71
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:01,754
Mr. Oldman's assistants
are responsible for assessments.

72
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,758
- I'll put you through.
- Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

73
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,051
I must speak
to Mr. Oldman in person.

74
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:11,220
Mr. Oldman never presides
over early appraisals.

75
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:13,345
But you see, before he died,

76
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:16,132
Dad told me that
if I decided to sell everything,

77
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:19,303
I should entrust the auction sale
to Mr. Virgil Oldman.

78
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,003
- In his opinion, the best.
- Sold!

79
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,304
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to present lot 231,

80
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,710
a refracting elongated telescope
constructed by Galileo Galilei.

81
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,093
It's still in perfect working order.

82
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,835
Can we open bidding,
please, at 1,000,000?

83
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,261
- 1,100,000.
- 1,100,000. 1,200,000.

84
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:45,134
1,300,000.

85
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,097
1,500,000 back in the room.
1,600,000.

86
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,256
1,700,000.
1,800,000 in the room.

87
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:55,798
1,900,000. 2,000,000.
At 2,000,000.

88
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:57,590
- (sneezing)
- Gesundheit. Was that a bid?

89
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:02,510
(laughter)
At 2,000,000. 2,100,000.

90
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:04,961
2,300,000 on the telephone.

91
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:07,799
2,500,000. I can sell it. 2,700,000.

92
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:11,427
At 2,700,000.
Any more? Are we all done?

93
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:13,511
At 2,700,000.

94
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:16,255
Sold. Congratulations, sir.

95
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:18,427
Lot 232.

96
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:22,460
Disciple of Boris Gregorian, Thurst.
Oil on canvas, 60 x 70.

97
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:24,635
This one will go to the best offer.

98
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,720
1,000. 2,000.

99
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,752
3,000. 4,000. 5,000 online.

100
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,052
6,000. 7,000.

101
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:41,713
8,000. 9,000 on the telephone.

102
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:44,467
10,000 back in the room.
11,000 online.

103
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:48,176
12,000. 13,000 online.
14,000. 15,000.

104
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:51,547
- This is not doing my neck any good.
- (laughter)

105
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:53,589
At 15,000.

106
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,967
20,000. At 20,000.

107
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,797
Any more? Sold!

108
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,926
(thunder rumbles)

109
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:58,218
(thunder cracks, rain falls)

110
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,755
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. Very.

111
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:20,804
You never miss a trick,
do you, governor?

112
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:26,338
- Who is it really?
- Yansky.

113
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,092
A Russian painter
who died in the late '30s.

114
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:31,344
An outstanding landscape painter.

115
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:36,301
But among his many landscapes,
he painted three portraits.

116
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:39,172
Only three in his whole life.

117
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,846
And this is one of the three.

118
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:46,553
It's double, alright?

119
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:49,589
How long have
we known each other?

120
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:50,967
Quite a while.

121
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:54,711
We've pulled off some sharp tricks
time after time.

122
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,506
Remember Milo Hensen?

123
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,761
You were the only one who knew
he was going to be big.

124
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,466
We got that portrait of his mother
for a song

125
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:06,094
from under the noses
of that bunch of idiots.

126
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:07,763
Must be worth a fortune now.

127
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,335
You almost sound bitter
you didn't get more.

128
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,209
Have we ever talked about money,
you and me?

129
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:15,924
- Honestly, no.
- It's been good enough for you.

130
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:18,336
It's been good enough for me,
you misery.

131
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:20,670
What matters is that you're satisfied.

132
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,089
My only regret is never being able
to persuade you

133
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,635
that my paintings are evidence
of a great artistic talent.

134
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,501
A love of art
and knowing how to hold a brush

135
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:32,179
doesn't make an artist.

136
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:35,547
You need an inner mystery.
A knack you've never possessed.

137
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:38,964
You're right. Double wasn't enough.

138
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:29,635
(choral music)

139
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:58,386
(Virgil, angrily)
In my 36 years in this business,

140
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:02,169
never has anyone had the gall
to keep me waiting 40 minutes.

141
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:05,013
It's a disgrace.
A display of bad manners.

142
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,419
(Claire) Let me explain.
I tried to call.

143
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,670
- There's no excuse.
- I tried to call.

144
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:11,635
Never come near me again.

145
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:14,672
Nobody answered and
I don't have your mobile number.

146
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:16,920
I do not possess a mobile phone.

147
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:24,584
(knock at door)

148
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:27,376
lt's the lbbetson woman
on the phone.

149
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,381
- Tell her to go to hell.
- She's crying.

150
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,006
Serves her right.

151
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,335
She was hit by a car
on her way to meet you.

152
00:14:34,513 --> 00:14:37,380
So much the worse for her.
It's no concern of mine.

153
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,089
She was left unconscious.

154
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:42,463
She was lying in a pool of blood
when the ambulance arrived.

155
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:46,169
Alright. Put her through.

156
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,469
(telephone rings)

157
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:55,043
- Yes?
- (Claire, crying) Please forgive me.

158
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:59,754
I had no intention
to be in any way disrespectful.

159
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,884
Nothing too serious, I hope.

160
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:05,420
No. Fortunately,
they'II... they'll let me out tomorrow.

161
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:08,713
Good.
I hope you make a speedy recovery.

162
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:10,925
Would you consent
to a new appointment?

163
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:15,005
- Please. (weeps)
- Alright.

164
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,170
But I'm sending an assistant.

165
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:20,344
I hope it's the same one
I spoke to last time.

166
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,257
What do you mean?

167
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:27,593
Well, I can't explain it,
but I understood from the outset

168
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:31,258
that voice could only
have been yours, Mr. Oldman.

169
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:34,090
(woman) Truly surprising,
wouldn't you say?

170
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:37,047
We think we'll be able
to bring out the whole face,

171
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:40,302
part of her dress
and the left side of the background.

172
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:43,796
(woman) Incredible. But what made
Mr. Oldman think that?

173
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:46,715
- What period is it from?
- Too soon to say.

174
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:49,423
Perhaps Mr. Oldman
will be able to work this out

175
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:51,717
more quickly and better than us.

176
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:56,091
- It's a fake.
- How is that possible?

177
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,544
- It's beautiful!
- I didn't say it wasn't.

178
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,214
I said it wasn't authentic.

179
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:02,757
From an analysis
of the pigments and wood,

180
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,961
we thought it was pre-17th century.

181
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:07,673
- Even older.
- Then it must be worth something.

182
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:12,384
It is a work by Valiante,
the female forger of the 16th century.

183
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,006
She copied masterpieces,

184
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,632
but couldn't sign them
as she was a woman,

185
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,050
so she marked them
with a personal code

186
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,088
hidden in the folds of the drapery

187
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:23,674
or in this case,
in the gaze of the subject.

188
00:16:23,971 --> 00:16:27,088
The beam of light on the iris
is nothing if not a V.

189
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:28,720
That is Valiante.

190
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:33,461
It is worth something,
but nothing compared to the original.

191
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:58,379
- Are you Mr. Oldman's assistant?
- Yes.

192
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,966
I'm Fred, the caretaker.
Pleased to meet you.

193
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:05,513
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

194
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:07,418
And Miss lbbetson?

195
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:09,965
She sends her apologies,

196
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:12,708
but overnight,
she was running a temperature.

197
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:16,502
She should have called me.
Spared myself a wasted trip.

198
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,510
Well, give her my best wishes.

199
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:21,346
She asked if you would go ahead
with valuation.

200
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:23,669
She's instructed me
to show you around.

201
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:27,425
Everything's at your disposal.
Come with me.

202
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:34,548
Miss lbbetson was hoping
to meet your boss.

203
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,802
It doesn't matter.
Your mistress didn't show up either.

204
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:39,132
Fair enough.

205
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:41,591
I suppose
it'll get the job done quicker.

206
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:44,174
(laughs)

207
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:49,422
Forgive the mess.

208
00:17:50,554 --> 00:17:54,465
It's gone to wrack and ruin ever since
Miss lbbetson's parents died.

209
00:17:56,554 --> 00:17:57,798
Let's go up.

210
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:01,634
How long since the owners died?

211
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:04,553
By the look of it,
you'd think it was centuries ago,

212
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:06,344
but it's only been one year.

213
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:10,334
First Mrs. Ibbetson and then,
scarcely 45 days later,

214
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:11,756
poor Mr. Ibbetson.

215
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:14,596
You have a good look.
Take your time.

216
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:16,718
Just getting these curtains open.

217
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:20,129
Too many windows in this room.

218
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:26,966
Okay.

219
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:34,130
How many brothers and sisters
does Miss lbbetson have?

220
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:35,845
None. She is an only child.

221
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:37,879
- Is she married?
- No.

222
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:40,673
- Has she ever been?
- No, no.

223
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:43,050
I don't think
she even has a boyfriend.

224
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:46,551
- Grandparents, aunts, uncles?
- No, none at all.

225
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:49,595
As far as I know,
Miss lbbetson is on her own.

226
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:54,751
So many rooms.

227
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,542
You know, I've never managed
to count them all.

228
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,799
Have there been other valuations
before me?

229
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:19,506
Absolutely none. Yours is the first.

230
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:22,636
Miss lbbetson is extremely fond
of this house.

231
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:24,463
Maybe too fond.

232
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:27,552
She'd prefer to keep everything,
but what can you do?

233
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:30,678
The empire crumbles.
A woman on her own can't cope.

234
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,052
Is she thinking of putting
the house up for sale as well?

235
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:37,840
That, I don't know. Maybe a part of it.

236
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:40,045
She won't get rid of the whole place.

237
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,088
What kind of work does she do?

238
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:45,670
I couldn't say.
I only dealt with her parents.

239
00:19:48,638 --> 00:19:50,924
- May I see the cellars?
- It's this way.

240
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:53,761
It's a long way down.

241
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:00,299
Go ahead.

242
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:45,084
I honestly don't get it.

243
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:48,469
In the time I've known you,
I've never seen you beaten.

244
00:20:48,763 --> 00:20:51,677
I've watched you produce
all manner of gadgets

245
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:53,801
from most unremarkable ironwork.

246
00:20:54,096 --> 00:20:56,715
Optical, arithmetical devices,
water clocks...

247
00:20:57,013 --> 00:21:01,302
Even that hairdryer that probably
dried the locks of Jules Verne's wife.

248
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:04,843
But you've nothing to say
about this curious contraption?

249
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,886
I'm surprised that
an art connoisseur like yourself

250
00:21:08,054 --> 00:21:10,886
can get so carried away
by a banal piece of ironwork.

251
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:13,721
It's not the object
that arouses my curiosity,

252
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:15,261
but it's contradiction.

253
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:18,505
- Contradiction?
- Look.

254
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,092
I found it in this position
in contact with damp flooring,

255
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:26,298
but the rust is all along the top
of the cogs, nowhere near the damp.

256
00:21:26,596 --> 00:21:27,709
What does this mean?

257
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:30,466
The object hadn't been there
for very long.

258
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:34,591
It got rusted in some other place.
Or someone turned it upside down.

259
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:38,093
That's all, nothing more than
a useless exercise in deduction.

260
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:39,922
Hi. Did you manage it?

261
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:41,375
Did you ever doubt me?

262
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:44,256
This works perfectly now.

263
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,922
And I transcribed
the recording from the tape.

264
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:50,133
You're a genius.
How much do I owe you?

265
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:51,678
Oh, nothing.

266
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:53,719
Maybe you'll invite me out.

267
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:54,966
Count on it.

268
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,875
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes, you can!

269
00:21:58,221 --> 00:21:59,382
That I am good at.

270
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:01,546
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

271
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:05,335
William-Adolphe Bouguereau.
The Birth Of Venus.

272
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:09,334
Authentic.

273
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:16,418
Umberto Veruda,
The Honest, 1890.

274
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:37,630
(Claire) You've been
the talk of the town lately.

275
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:39,629
I hoped to see you
on TV.

276
00:22:39,804 --> 00:22:42,636
I don't like to appear.
I prefer to remain in shadow.

277
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:44,380
We're much the same that way.

278
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,260
That doesn't mean we'll agree.

279
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:48,503
My secretary's been looking for you.

280
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:51,677
How do you know that a painter
will become collectable?

281
00:22:51,846 --> 00:22:55,460
Intuition, which also makes
me doubt your intentions.

282
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:59,678
Sorry for that impression but I've
entrusted you with my belongings.

283
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,173
That's not how it works.

284
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,297
There must be a signed contract
before the inventory.

285
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:07,173
It takes time,
and unless you stop fooling around

286
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:10,048
and decide to come out
it will never get started.

287
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,295
Go ahead with the inventory.

288
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:13,928
I'll meet you at the villa.

289
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:15,719
We'll reach an agreement.

290
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:17,297
You have my word.

291
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:19,711
- (man) Take these.
- (man 2) Yes.

292
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:20,966
Be careful!

293
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:23,258
I'm not sure
but it looks German to me.

294
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:25,918
Austrian. Careful with that.

295
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:28,300
It's 11:00
The appointment was 8:30.

296
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:32,132
She's not answering.
She said she'll come. She'll be here.

297
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:34,675
The piano doesn't need restoration.

298
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,876
Quite so.

299
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:38,092
We have to check it
but there's no key.

300
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:39,506
But here it is.

301
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,551
Last time there was no key.

302
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:42,799
Looks good.

303
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,963
(worker) Mr Oldman!

304
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:47,093
Would you help me
with the bookcase?

305
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:50,214
Italian bookcase, wood. First half
of...

306
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,418
Who smashed this?

307
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,919
Nobody, Mr Oldman,
it was already broken.

308
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:56,051
Is this part of the house inhabited?

309
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:57,418
Why?

310
00:23:57,596 --> 00:23:59,503
There have been some changes.

311
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:01,043
No, no, Mr...

312
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:03,295
I'm sorry, I'm not sure of your name.

313
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:04,750
I thought you were...

314
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:06,553
It doesn't matter who I am.

315
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:08,261
Nobody lives here.

316
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:11,961
Be that as it may, if your mistress
is not here by midday

317
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:14,970
I will have no option but to
suspend operations.

318
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:21,216
(Fred) Mr Oldman!

319
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,168
Miss lbbetson.

320
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,384
(Claire)
Hello, Mr Oldman?

321
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:32,007
Mr Oldman, can you hear me?

322
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,794
Mr Oldman, I apologise.
What must you think of me?

323
00:24:35,971 --> 00:24:38,755
Spare me
the self-serving justifications.

324
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:39,959
Let me speak.

325
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:43,503
I cannot touch your things
without a contract. Is that clear?

326
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,547
Would you leave it on the table
in the hallway?

327
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:49,209
I'll sign it.
I accept all your conditions.

328
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,094
Yes, but I do not accept yours.

329
00:24:51,263 --> 00:24:54,675
I will not do business
with a silly, superficial phantom.

330
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:55,924
(crash)

331
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:57,755
(Fred shouts) Be careful!

332
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,133
I understand your exasperation.

333
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:03,089
But please believe me
I didn't mean anything by it.

334
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:07,505
It's been a series of unfortunate,
unintentional mishaps.

335
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:10,002
So what exactly happened today?

336
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:14,255
My car was stolen and I had to go
to the police to report it.

337
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,501
Which police station did you go to?

338
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,670
The one in the city.
- Whereabouts?

339
00:25:20,013 --> 00:25:22,631
- On the main square.
- Which square?

340
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:25,133
(echoing)
No more interrogation!

341
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:27,627
No more!
Who do you think you are?

342
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:30,092
(crash echoes around room)

343
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:34,469
Are you here, Miss lbbetson?

344
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:36,877
What kind of question is that?

345
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:38,251
Are you here?

346
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:40,752
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

347
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:43,133
- lf you're here, come out now.
- Stop it!

348
00:25:43,304 --> 00:25:46,586
Explain the meaning of this game
which I do not find amusing.

349
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,800
Call me tonight. I'll explain.

350
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:50,345
(hangs up phone)

351
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:54,086
(Robert) lt's the same material

352
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,052
and the same workmanship too.

353
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,259
These belong to the same system.

354
00:25:58,596 --> 00:26:01,167
There's no signature,
no inscription?

355
00:26:01,513 --> 00:26:07,094
I mean when I've got the rust and
the oxidisation off the other piece.

356
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:09,543
There's nothing.

357
00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:14,841
I can do the same with these but, I
mean, right now I can't see anything.

358
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:16,754
(whistles)

359
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:20,503
What have you found?

360
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:24,046
The technique, how the cog
has been attached to it's axis.

361
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:26,792
It's really old.
I've never seen it before.

362
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:29,092
Here, look. Have a look.

363
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,132
It's 18th century.

364
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:41,461
We could be onto
something big here.

365
00:26:41,638 --> 00:26:43,509
Could you guess what it is?

366
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:48,004
Three pieces of the mosaic
is not enough, Mr Oldman.

367
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:52,506
In the last few years
the old couple were unwell.

368
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,966
The house was in
a terrible state then.

369
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:59,752
Mr lbbetson always said
that they'd have to sell something.

370
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:02,051
And Miss Claire. How old is she?

371
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,510
About 27.

372
00:27:06,888 --> 00:27:09,293
What else can you tell me
about her?

373
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:10,798
Nothing really.

374
00:27:11,138 --> 00:27:14,384
I've never had much to do with her.
I don't really know her.

375
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:18,880
And yet you've been in the service
of the lbbetsons for about 10 years.

376
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:23,840
(Fred) Well, 11 years to be exact.

377
00:27:24,221 --> 00:27:26,128
I don't have much to do with her.

378
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:28,757
I talk to her often
at all hours but...

379
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:30,470
But?

380
00:27:30,804 --> 00:27:32,842
I've never seen her.

381
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:36,717
- How could that be?
- It's the truth. Not once.

382
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:38,595
Why?

383
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:45,378
Because Miss Claire
suffers from a very strange illness.

384
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:49,422
- (Claire) Hello.
- Good evening. It's Oldman.

385
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:51,053
I was expecting your call.

386
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:54,800
I have no wish to quarrel
and I'm sorry if I was rude today.

387
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:56,049
It doesn't matter.

388
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:59,089
But if I confirm I am available,
at the same time

389
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:02,710
I cannot permit this joke in poor taste
to continue any longer.

390
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:05,673
I wish you to stop
all involvement in my affairs.

391
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:07,552
I apologise for the trouble.

392
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:09,676
Send me your bill.
Good night.

393
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:11,090
(hangs up)

394
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:20,091
(Virgil) Lot 93. Valiante.
Portrait of a Lady.

395
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:21,293
16th century,

396
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:24,967
inspired by the Portrait of
a Young Girl by Petrus Christus.

397
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:26,251
Oil on wood. 30 x 40.

398
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:29,001
I have here an opening
bid of £20,000.

399
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:31,881
- (man) £22,000.
- £22,000.

400
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:35,005
£24,000. £26,000 on the telephone.

401
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:38,343
£28,000 in the room. £30,000.

402
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:40,469
£35,000. Thank you, sir.

403
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:44,545
£40,000 on the telephone.
£45,000 in the room.

404
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:46,048
£50,000.

405
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:50,879
£55,000. £60,000.
£65,000 on the telephone.

406
00:28:51,221 --> 00:28:53,840
£70,000. At £70,000.

407
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:58,136
Any advance on £70,000? £75,000.

408
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,508
£80,000 on the telephone.
Any more?

409
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:02,551
All done at £80,000.

410
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:04,546
All done at £80,000.

411
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:08,589
£90,000. Any more?

412
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:10,881
Sold.

413
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:14,792
- Thank you, sir.
- (woman) I bid £90,000 too.

414
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:18,089
Mr Oldman should have been
aware of that.

415
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:21,960
I don't believe so, Mrs Derain.
Mr Whistler bid £90,000.

416
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,586
- He was the only one.
- (man) They bid simultaneously.

417
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:28,168
(woman) She got her bid in first.
I saw it.

418
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:29,886
What should we do?

419
00:29:30,054 --> 00:29:34,427
I'm the biggest collector of Valiante
forgeries and I'll sue you!

420
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:38,342
You were too slow, Billy! You didn't
get in with your bid in time.

421
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,385
And you were too late. Too late.

422
00:29:40,554 --> 00:29:42,841
You didn't keep up with me
for God's sake!

423
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:46,011
She was behind me.
If I'd seen I'd have bid again.

424
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:48,218
You're losing it!

425
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:49,501
Maybe you're right

426
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,298
but it's not the first time
we've messed up.

427
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:56,133
It's the way things go. Never went
into a rage like this before.

428
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,719
That wasn't a Valiante forgery.

429
00:30:00,054 --> 00:30:02,507
It was the genuine one
by Petrus Christus.

430
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:05,799
It'll be worth £8 million.

431
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,629
Woe be me.

432
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:13,218
I'm sorry. Honestly.

433
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:17,885
But even when we lost
Van Gogh's Lady With The Fan

434
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:19,879
you didn't take it this hard.

435
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:22,427
What's going on, Virgil?

436
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:28,301
(woman) 642.

437
00:30:28,471 --> 00:30:30,011
729.

438
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:33,924
918.

439
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:36,335
1,011.

440
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,009
1,119.

441
00:30:40,346 --> 00:30:42,669
1,320.

442
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:45,252
1,404.

443
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:47,800
- What will you have?
- (woman) 1,581.

444
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,001
Tea, thank you.

445
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:54,171
(woman) 8,109.

446
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:56,468
8,725.

447
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:59,885
(man) Sorry, darling, 8,625.

448
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:02,625
(woman) 8,725!

449
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:05,086
8,725.

450
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,300
(man 2) Take a closer look,
you moron.

451
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:10,719
(man) Shit! You're right, 8,725.
Well done, girl!

452
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:12,345
That's it?

453
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:25,803
- (woman) Bye!
- (woman 2) Bye!

454
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,797
(Robert) I gave them a clean
with this special fluid.

455
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:34,846
And I have studied them
by the millimetre

456
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:37,299
and look what's come up.

457
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:39,376
Vaucanson.

458
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:43,631
I can't believe it!
Jacques Vaucanson.

459
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:45,960
18th century constructor
of automata.

460
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,053
When I was a student
I did my thesis on him.

461
00:31:49,388 --> 00:31:51,213
That's incredible!

462
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:54,551
One of his most famous androids
even managed to talk.

463
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:57,968
Exactly.
People would pay to ask it questions.

464
00:31:58,138 --> 00:32:03,008
The android would move its head,
bow, and give its reply.

465
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,259
I bet there was someone inside.

466
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:06,886
You know, a dwarf maybe.

467
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:10,751
Just like Edgar Allan Poe suspected
with Maelzel's Chess Player.

468
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,133
More than likely.

469
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:15,591
But the mystery
that nobody could explain

470
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:18,595
was how Vaucanson's
automaton always got it right.

471
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:22,253
Of course there was trickery
in making the automaton talk.

472
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:25,463
Everything it said was true.

473
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:28,838
You bring me all the pieces.

474
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:33,089
I promise to put them back together
exactly how Vaucanson had them.

475
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:34,506
I don't doubt it

476
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,796
but I fear I've lost my chance
to get the missing pieces.

477
00:32:38,138 --> 00:32:40,756
They must be in the same place
you found these.

478
00:32:41,096 --> 00:32:43,335
And all I need is 80%
of the elements,

479
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:46,380
and I can work out the rest
and rebuild it myself.

480
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:48,461
- It's not that easy.
- (horn beeps)

481
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:52,092
I'm sorry. That's my girlfriend.

482
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,048
Hey, Sarah, this is Mr Virgil Oldman.

483
00:33:00,304 --> 00:33:01,927
Pleased to meet you, Sarah.

484
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:05,129
It's a pleasure. Robert has told me
so much about you.

485
00:33:05,304 --> 00:33:08,302
Don't young people talk about
more exciting things?

486
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:10,296
Why don't you eat with us?

487
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:12,841
That's very kind.
Another time, thank you.

488
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,674
Alright, we won't insist.
We'll promise.

489
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:17,719
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

490
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:27,508
Cancel New York and tell
the Alphasons to meet us here.

491
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:29,504
We called the meeting.

492
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:32,755
So we've changed our minds.
Is that a problem?

493
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,293
Alright, Mr Oldman.

494
00:33:39,346 --> 00:33:41,052
Claire lbbetson phoned.

495
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:43,542
What does she want now?

496
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,795
She asked you to meet her
at 2:30.

497
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:47,927
Meet her where?

498
00:33:48,263 --> 00:33:50,170
At the lbbetson villa.

499
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:51,755
Where else?

500
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:52,504
(Claire) I'm extremely grateful to you
for coming, Mr Oldman.

501
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:56,217
How did you know it was me?

502
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:58,592
Fred has a limp. You don't.

503
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,303
Ah.

504
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:04,755
To be honest I didn't expect
you'd want to speak to me.

505
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:09,757
I know you can't stand my excuses.
If I were you, I wouldn't either.

506
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:11,208
In fact, your beh...

507
00:35:11,388 --> 00:35:12,549
How should I put it?

508
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:14,344
Speak frankly. Don't worry.

509
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:18,632
I won't deny that your whimsical
little ways

510
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:20,261
are getting a bit tiresome.

511
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:23,886
I hope not too tiresome.

512
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:29,428
But I wanted to say sorry
for... well, my behaviour.

513
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:33,967
Typical of a "silly, superficial
woman", as you put it.

514
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:36,886
Why do you systematically
avoid meeting me?

515
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:39,175
Nothing personal, believe me.

516
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,834
Why would you want to do
business with a person

517
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:44,170
who arouses such aversion in you

518
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:46,917
that you can't even look him
in the face?

519
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:50,339
It's hard to explain. You won't
believe me anyway.

520
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,052
If I didn't believe you, I wouldn't be
here playing hide and seek.

521
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:56,678
I don't meet many people.

522
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:00,085
It's been a long time now.

523
00:36:00,263 --> 00:36:03,260
I see nothing serious in that.

524
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,626
Everyone has moments

525
00:36:04,804 --> 00:36:07,506
when they prefer solitude
to the multitudes.

526
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,511
I haven't left this house
since I was 15.

527
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:14,509
- I don't think I understand.
- You understand perfectly.

528
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:16,255
This is my room.

529
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,048
If there's somebody in the house
or in the villa,

530
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:21,258
I lock myself up in here.

531
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,126
I've always done that,
even when my parents were here.

532
00:36:25,304 --> 00:36:26,927
I hardly ever saw them.

533
00:36:27,096 --> 00:36:28,293
I don't see anybody.

534
00:36:29,262 --> 00:36:30,341
But why?

535
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:33,713
Why do you go around with
your hands covered by gloves?

536
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:36,885
lt's a question of hygiene.
I don't see the connection.

537
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:38,926
You're afraid to touch others.

538
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,382
To touch their possessions
disgusts you.

539
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:44,589
I'm afraid of going to places
where others live.

540
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:47,547
These seem to me
very similar personal choices.

541
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:52,418
You'd like me to believe you haven't
walked a street in 12 years?

542
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:53,959
I see you know my age.

543
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:58,215
Being a hermit and employing
a caretaker doesn't add up.

544
00:36:58,554 --> 00:37:01,836
I walk about quite a bit,
if that's what you want to know,

545
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:05,129
inside the villa
when there's nobody here,

546
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:08,255
which is often now,
but I never go out.

547
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:11,585
The very idea paralyses me.

548
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:16,300
I hope you understand me now.

549
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:19,920
I hope that, within the limits
of your work, you'll help me.

550
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:23,218
You have my word, Miss lbbetson.

551
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:26,800
As to any agreement between us,
I leave it to you to set your fee.

552
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:28,250
I trust you blindly.

553
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,551
Leave the contract on the table.

554
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:35,713
You'll find it signed next time.

555
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,464
Now, please, I'm very tired.

556
00:37:50,263 --> 00:37:52,549
Apart from your fondness
for my gloves,

557
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:54,925
what made you decide
to call me again?

558
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:56,423
I haven't been kind.

559
00:37:57,554 --> 00:38:00,967
I was taken by the way you
were looking at my house yesterday

560
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:02,547
from the bar opposite.

561
00:38:06,388 --> 00:38:08,343
You found the missing pieces.

562
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:12,127
In the meantime
make do with this one.

563
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:14,378
How much would the
automaton be worth

564
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:16,841
if we manage to make it work?

565
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:18,920
Think of a really, really high figure.

566
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:23,549
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

567
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:25,967
You've probably pitched it
too low.

568
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,053
You're good at talking
without saying anything.

569
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:31,508
I'll take that as a compliment.

570
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:34,460
Should things go
the way I trust they will,

571
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:36,675
you'll be very handsomely rewarded.

572
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:40,958
I didn't mean to talk about money.
It's a real privilege for me.

573
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:42,714
Where did you find these?

574
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,254
There are very precise rules
in the world of antiques.

575
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:48,716
It's forbidden to reveal
one's sources.

576
00:38:57,388 --> 00:39:00,302
There's a few more gears
but bigger in that corner.

577
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:04,002
Gather them together. I'll take
care of the cataloguing myself.

578
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:05,209
Of course.

579
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:07,543
Candlesticks.

580
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,470
- Which period?
- 17th-century. Repair.

581
00:39:12,388 --> 00:39:13,466
(Fred) Mr Oldman.

582
00:39:19,304 --> 00:39:20,583
(Claire) Mr Oldman.

583
00:39:21,763 --> 00:39:22,924
Yes.

584
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:26,094
What have you decided
about the furniture in this wing?

585
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,336
We're only drawing up
the inventory.

586
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:30,633
Later you can tell me
what to leave out.

587
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:31,882
Thank you.

588
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:38,089
Listen, Miss lbbetson, I can't help
thinking about your situation.

589
00:39:38,263 --> 00:39:40,668
I'm sorry to have
intruded on your thoughts.

590
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:42,422
That's not the point.

591
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:45,215
I've been wondering how you
can live like this.

592
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:47,461
I'm organised and self-sufficient,

593
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:50,470
I don't need any help
but I appreciate your concern.

594
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,965
You're welcome.

595
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:57,298
- See you soon, then.
- Have a good day.

596
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:00,799
Mr Oldman!

597
00:40:02,888 --> 00:40:04,261
Your contract.

598
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:22,004
I read it and it seems fine to me.

599
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:24,876
I initialled every page
and signed the last.

600
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:26,879
That's how it's done, isn't it?

601
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:28,168
Perfect.

602
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:30,632
But your personal details
are missing.

603
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:35,880
Take them from my passport.

604
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:48,461
But it expired quite some time ago.

605
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:52,217
- Personal details never expire.
- That's true enough, I suppose.

606
00:40:52,388 --> 00:40:55,255
I was just a girl then
but it'll do for your purposes.

607
00:41:10,221 --> 00:41:13,089
I wanted to mention
that in certain critical cases

608
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:16,011
my advice is to proceed
directly to restoration.

609
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:17,376
You know best.

610
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:20,303
It means the whole thing
will take a little longer.

611
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:22,794
We can widen
the scope of the valuation.

612
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:24,251
I understand.

613
00:41:39,388 --> 00:41:41,461
You dye your hair.
I never noticed.

614
00:41:41,804 --> 00:41:45,466
I'm disgusted by people
who don't trust their own hair!

615
00:41:45,638 --> 00:41:48,470
I don't trust people who think so
much of themselves

616
00:41:48,638 --> 00:41:50,463
that they won't come outside.

617
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:55,833
Ah, sir, there'll be no more
caretaker service as from Monday.

618
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,964
I'll just come in to bring
Miss lbbetson her shopping.

619
00:41:59,138 --> 00:42:02,254
- The matter is of no interest to me.
- These are the keys.

620
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:07,464
- Why give them to me?
- It's what Miss lbbetson wanted.

621
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:10,505
In case you needed access
for further inspection.

622
00:42:13,346 --> 00:42:15,420
When you come in, slam the door,

623
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:18,216
otherwise she'll get scared
and panic.

624
00:42:30,638 --> 00:42:32,344
(Robert) I'm going off my head

625
00:42:32,513 --> 00:42:35,261
trying to work out the alignment
of these devices,

626
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,131
trying to figure out
which one fitted into which.

627
00:42:38,304 --> 00:42:40,674
- That can't be easy.
- But not impossible.

628
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:44,632
You know,
gearboxes are like people.

629
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:47,758
If they've been together
long enough,

630
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:50,418
eventually,
they take on each other's forms.

631
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:55,671
So, you believe time can make
any kind of cohabitation possible?

632
00:42:55,846 --> 00:42:57,422
Yeah, well, absolutely.

633
00:42:57,763 --> 00:43:01,009
You've reminded me of a friend
who met a much younger girl.

634
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,720
She had agoraphobia.

635
00:43:03,054 --> 00:43:05,210
Fear of open spaces
and distances?

636
00:43:05,554 --> 00:43:09,500
Exactly. She lived for years locked
up in an apartment on her own.

637
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:15,010
Recently, she gave him the keys
to her house and ever since,

638
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:17,335
he's been in a state of...

639
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,303
...permanent anxiety.

640
00:43:23,096 --> 00:43:26,592
What did I tell you? Now
he'll be constantly worried about her.

641
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:28,007
He'll be thinking,

642
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:32,043
"What does she need, shampoo,
medicine, tights... yoghurt?"

643
00:43:32,388 --> 00:43:33,928
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

644
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:36,297
I'm not so sure.

645
00:43:36,638 --> 00:43:38,427
Tell your friend to stay calm,

646
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:41,428
'cause time is already
working on their gearboxes.

647
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:52,592
And there you are, Mr. Oldman.

648
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:59,839
- (Claire) Are you angry with me?
- Why should I be?

649
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:02,583
- What I said about your hair.
- Not at all.

650
00:44:03,638 --> 00:44:04,965
I was just calling to ask

651
00:44:05,138 --> 00:44:09,297
if you wish the sale of the furniture
to be identified by your family name.

652
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:11,343
Or do you prefer anonymity?

653
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:14,048
- Anonymity, anonymity.
- Good.

654
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:17,004
This time, I did see you.

655
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:18,672
- Oh?
- On TV.

656
00:44:18,846 --> 00:44:21,844
I don't generally give interviews
but I was forced to.

657
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:23,838
You're more intriguing this way.

658
00:44:24,013 --> 00:44:26,679
You'll be a great success
with the ladies.

659
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:29,050
(Virgil) So, we go to Lot 132.

660
00:44:29,221 --> 00:44:31,756
Gustave Rett,
Portrait of a Woman With a Hat.

661
00:44:32,096 --> 00:44:37,168
1956. Oil on canvas. 80 x 100 cm.

662
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:39,716
This one goes to the best offer.

663
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:41,677
£10,000.

664
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,920
(ringing tone)

665
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:54,960
Fred, any news from Miss lbbetson?
She hasn't answered in days.

666
00:44:55,138 --> 00:44:57,377
It's a while
since I heard from her.

667
00:44:57,554 --> 00:44:59,379
I've been in bed all week, ill.

668
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:01,510
Who's been bringing her food?

669
00:45:09,596 --> 00:45:10,875
Miss lbbetson?

670
00:45:17,596 --> 00:45:19,136
Miss lbbetson?

671
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:31,592
Miss lbbetson? Answer me!

672
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,383
- (Claire gasps)
- Claire?

673
00:45:39,096 --> 00:45:40,470
Claire, are you alright?

674
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:43,760
(Claire shouts) Oh, no. Please!

675
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:45,884
- No. It's me, Claire.
- Get out!

676
00:45:46,054 --> 00:45:47,926
- It's me, Mr. Oldman.
- Go away!

677
00:45:48,096 --> 00:45:50,382
- Listen to me, it's Mr. Oldman.
- Get out!

678
00:45:50,554 --> 00:45:53,090
There's nobody else here.
Calm down.

679
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:55,300
What's wrong?
Tell me what happened.

680
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,047
I wasn't well.

681
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:00,258
I didn't know who to call.

682
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:01,591
Nobody answered.

683
00:46:01,763 --> 00:46:04,085
(sobs) And then I fell.

684
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:07,214
I fell and I hit my...

685
00:46:07,554 --> 00:46:09,260
- Open the door.
- (cries)

686
00:46:09,596 --> 00:46:11,136
You need to see a doctor.

687
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:14,138
No, please! (yelps) Please!

688
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,794
Please, no!

689
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:22,092
Can you fix a broken auctioneer
as well?

690
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:24,219
I wouldn't know where to begin.

691
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:26,877
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Oldman.

692
00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:30,669
Is something wrong? You seem
more preoccupied than usual.

693
00:46:30,846 --> 00:46:32,801
Too many woodworms
and spider webs

694
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:35,210
and too few masterpieces.

695
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:36,928
Could we put it that way?

696
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:40,792
- So, how's our toy coming along?
- Ah.

697
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:44,052
Well, I've managed to put
some sections back together.

698
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:49,626
But, I mean, there's just still
too many pieces missing.

699
00:46:50,763 --> 00:46:52,552
The entire exterior.

700
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:55,720
We can't establish
what kind of character he is.

701
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:58,543
Like my friend
and his girl in the tower.

702
00:46:58,888 --> 00:47:01,755
Yeah, maybe, although
we've never seen our android.

703
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:04,085
We're still groping around
in the dark.

704
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:05,803
So is he.

705
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:08,460
He speaks to her
through a closed door.

706
00:47:08,804 --> 00:47:10,878
- Closed door?
- Yes.

707
00:47:11,054 --> 00:47:15,130
If anybody moves in the house,
she barricades herself in her room.

708
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:19,630
- He's never seen her face?
- Not only him, no-one has.

709
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:22,802
That's like when two young people
meet on the internet.

710
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:26,254
They get to know each other,
then reveal themselves.

711
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:28,135
She won't reveal herself.

712
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,173
Maybe he hasn't
got a good strategy.

713
00:47:32,638 --> 00:47:36,217
So, it's more difficult for my friend
to succeed in his enterprise

714
00:47:36,388 --> 00:47:39,339
than for us to reconstruct
the Vaucanson automaton?

715
00:47:39,513 --> 00:47:43,341
Depends on the number of rusty
pieces you're able to bring me.

716
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:45,053
Well...

717
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,803
...here's one more.

718
00:47:49,804 --> 00:47:51,297
That's a mobile phone.

719
00:47:52,596 --> 00:47:53,626
This is brand new.

720
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:57,086
I'm the one that's rusty
because I don't know how to use it.

721
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:00,380
Could you teach me
before your girlfriend gets here?

722
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:15,044
(mobile phone rings)

723
00:48:19,471 --> 00:48:21,959
- Hello.
- (Claire) Good evening, Mr. Oldman.

724
00:48:22,138 --> 00:48:24,507
It's Claire Ibbetson.
Am I disturbing you?

725
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:26,634
- No, not at all, Miss lbbetson.

726
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:30,300
I told you, from now on,
you can call me any time you like.

727
00:48:30,471 --> 00:48:32,011
I wanted to thank you for...

728
00:48:33,138 --> 00:48:34,714
...everything, really.

729
00:48:34,888 --> 00:48:38,300
No need. All that's important
is you're feeling better now.

730
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:41,469
Yes, it was just a small cut
on the head. I'm much better.

731
00:48:41,638 --> 00:48:44,422
I wanted to tell you,
I looked over the inventory.

732
00:48:44,763 --> 00:48:47,002
Oh! What do you think?

733
00:48:48,263 --> 00:48:50,585
You've done a great job.
Really, you have.

734
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,960
But I'm troubled
by so many doubts.

735
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:57,834
I'm not sure if it's a good idea
to sell. What would you advise?

736
00:48:58,013 --> 00:49:00,797
I couldn't say. I don't know
what your plans are.

737
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,708
Why did you decide
to sell in the first place?

738
00:49:03,888 --> 00:49:07,751
Out of necessity in order to start
life afresh or another reason?

739
00:49:08,096 --> 00:49:10,051
All of the above, I suppose.

740
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:13,254
I'd even sell the house.
It's too big for me now.

741
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:17,091
Sometimes, I feel as though
I were in a public square.

742
00:49:17,263 --> 00:49:19,300
I'd like something smaller.

743
00:49:19,471 --> 00:49:21,378
But the idea of having to leave here

744
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:23,841
and go somewhere else
fills me with dread.

745
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:25,635
How would I manage it?

746
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:29,086
Wear blindfolds? Have myself
carried out while asleep?

747
00:49:29,263 --> 00:49:32,593
I'd get into a state and end up
putting everything off.

748
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:38,630
You have all the time in the world
to make up your mind.

749
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:41,880
- You think?
- Well, until the catalogue is printed.

750
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:46,167
Don't torment yourself.
Think of yourself, your future.

751
00:49:46,346 --> 00:49:48,420
That's the biggest torment of all.

752
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:50,919
When I think about it,
I can't even work.

753
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:53,501
I didn't know you were working.

754
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:58,004
I write. I write novels, stories,
things like that.

755
00:49:58,346 --> 00:50:00,467
I'd like to read them. I'll buy some.

756
00:50:00,804 --> 00:50:03,209
Luckily for us,
you'll never manage to.

757
00:50:03,554 --> 00:50:04,928
Why not?

758
00:50:05,096 --> 00:50:08,841
Because I write under a pseudonym
and I loathe what I write.

759
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:12,177
Artists always loathe
what they make, Miss lbbetson.

760
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,301
Yesterday, you called me Claire.

761
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,297
I wasn't aware.
I was in a state of alarm.

762
00:50:19,471 --> 00:50:21,841
- Sorry.
- I'd like you to continue.

763
00:50:23,304 --> 00:50:27,298
"I'd like you to continue."
She said it to him, just like that.

764
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:29,011
Well, what did he say?

765
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:32,177
He was taken back but he went
along with what she wanted.

766
00:50:32,512 --> 00:50:33,970
What else could he do?

767
00:50:34,304 --> 00:50:37,385
I'd have asked her to do the same,
call me by my first name.

768
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:39,047
That's not his style.

769
00:50:39,221 --> 00:50:42,172
Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

770
00:50:42,346 --> 00:50:44,751
Then he'll never get her out of there.

771
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:48,093
(automaton) I don't
think my friend intends to court her.

772
00:50:48,263 --> 00:50:51,177
I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

773
00:50:51,346 --> 00:50:52,543
Horrible voice!

774
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:56,134
I'd have thought he'd at least
have desired to see her face.

775
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:59,136
'Desired's probably
not the right word.

776
00:50:59,304 --> 00:51:03,215
Curious to see her, perhaps.
Yes, I could understand that.

777
00:51:03,388 --> 00:51:06,469
But the chances of it happening
seem to be really remote.

778
00:51:06,638 --> 00:51:07,965
There might be a way.

779
00:51:08,304 --> 00:51:10,627
Just depends on how brave
your friend is.

780
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:14,418
- (Virgil) The French bureau.
- (Claire) Yes.

781
00:51:14,596 --> 00:51:18,459
- The table with the roll top.
- No, I'd like to keep that.

782
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:21,553
That's it.
Next time, we'll do the paintings.

783
00:51:21,888 --> 00:51:23,795
- OK.
- One last thing, Claire.

784
00:51:23,971 --> 00:51:27,834
You'll have to decide whether we do
the photography here or in a studio.

785
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:31,130
In a studio. I don't want
many people around the house.

786
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:34,138
That's the best solution.
Well, I'm off now.

787
00:51:34,304 --> 00:51:37,219
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Mr. Oldman.

788
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,426
When will we next see each other?

789
00:51:41,763 --> 00:51:46,420
You mean, when do you see me?
Since I am not given that privilege.

790
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:49,842
- Forgive me.
- But soon.

791
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:53,085
- Have a good day.
- You too.

792
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:22,417
(mobile phone rings)

793
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:30,757
Hello?

794
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:59,254
- I can't believe it.
- I couldn't sleep at night, Virgil.

795
00:53:59,429 --> 00:54:02,510
I had to do something to make
you forgive me.

796
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:04,421
But how did you get it?

797
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:07,844
I heard that Mrs. Durane
had fallen on hard times,

798
00:54:08,013 --> 00:54:12,717
so I persuaded her to sell it to me
for £250,000.

799
00:54:12,888 --> 00:54:15,092
Hmm, not exactly cheap!

800
00:54:15,263 --> 00:54:17,253
I thought it was a reasonable price.

801
00:54:17,596 --> 00:54:19,586
You were talking about £8 million.

802
00:54:19,763 --> 00:54:22,002
This way,
everyone gets a good deal.

803
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:25,260
How much do you want, Billy?

804
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,048
I don't want a penny more
than I gave the old girl.

805
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:30,258
Now you're really losing your grip.

806
00:54:30,596 --> 00:54:32,752
I just want to get back
to where we were.

807
00:54:33,096 --> 00:54:35,845
How was your friend,
your accomplice,

808
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:38,217
your trusted procurer of women?

809
00:54:39,804 --> 00:54:43,584
lf you're doing this to win back my
trust, it's been a bad deal for you.

810
00:54:45,263 --> 00:54:47,300
You never lost it in the first place.

811
00:54:47,638 --> 00:54:49,545
- Oh!
- (laughs)

812
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:54,135
(Robert laughs) This is great.
This is great!

813
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:56,213
You found important stuff.

814
00:54:56,388 --> 00:54:58,259
Best bit is this.

815
00:55:00,554 --> 00:55:03,422
- An ear.
- A step forward, wouldn't you say?

816
00:55:03,763 --> 00:55:06,216
I'd say!
I'd say we're at a turning point.

817
00:55:06,388 --> 00:55:07,631
Look.

818
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:15,469
- Huh?
- Excellent.

819
00:55:15,804 --> 00:55:18,293
The pieces are attracting each other.

820
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:19,501
So...

821
00:55:20,846 --> 00:55:24,093
How did things go with your... friend?

822
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:30,423
How many seconds did it take you
to realise I was talking about myself?

823
00:55:30,596 --> 00:55:32,421
Quite a few, to be honest.

824
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:35,215
Let me confess,
I didn't follow your advice.

825
00:55:36,304 --> 00:55:40,345
There was something too contorted
about it, too imprudent.

826
00:55:40,513 --> 00:55:42,089
Yeah, OK, I see your point.

827
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:02,795
(ringing tone)

828
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:07,255
(woman) The mathematical set
of a six-day week.

829
00:56:08,513 --> 00:56:13,502
The mathematical set
of a 51-minute hour.

830
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:17,672
- What will you have, sir?
- Tea, please.

831
00:56:18,013 --> 00:56:19,968
Have you thought of anything else?

832
00:56:20,138 --> 00:56:22,756
The length of a point.
The direction of a circle.

833
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:25,169
- (ringing tone)
- Your tea's ready, sir.

834
00:56:25,346 --> 00:56:29,091
The edge of a circumference.
The centre of space.

835
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,546
- The area of a segment.
- Amazing. Well done!

836
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:39,298
The vertical position of a sphere.

837
00:56:41,221 --> 00:56:43,970
I brought the furniture
and painting valuations.

838
00:56:44,138 --> 00:56:47,550
Look at them carefully because
you'll have to authorise them.

839
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:51,667
- I don't know a thing about this.
- I know. Trust me, Miss lbbetson.

840
00:56:51,846 --> 00:56:54,678
You've been spending time
in the cellars recently.

841
00:56:54,846 --> 00:56:58,507
- Is that why you changed the locks?
- I change them every six months.

842
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:04,255
And I take care to double-check,
compare and correct

843
00:57:04,596 --> 00:57:07,380
when dealing with
odds and ends in cellars.

844
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:10,007
It's how I work.
If it upsets you, speak now.

845
00:57:10,388 --> 00:57:14,049
You'll find the new keys on the table.
Please take them.

846
00:57:18,471 --> 00:57:20,592
Thank you for your trust.

847
00:57:20,763 --> 00:57:22,919
Were you offended
at being locked out?

848
00:57:23,096 --> 00:57:24,293
No, but I was worried.

849
00:57:25,638 --> 00:57:28,719
You're right, I should have told you.
I'm sorry.

850
00:57:30,846 --> 00:57:34,425
Claire, you're ruining your life
for reasons which are beyond me.

851
00:57:34,763 --> 00:57:38,342
This illness of yours is so absurd,
it almost seems unreal.

852
00:57:40,013 --> 00:57:42,631
My mother thought
I was faking it the first time.

853
00:57:42,804 --> 00:57:44,178
We were abroad.

854
00:57:44,346 --> 00:57:47,344
I was so afraid of walking
at the foot of the Eiffel Tower

855
00:57:47,513 --> 00:57:48,922
that it paralysed me.

856
00:57:49,096 --> 00:57:52,047
I started screaming,
fell to the ground.

857
00:57:52,221 --> 00:57:55,421
I was just a little girl, but it kept
happening more and more

858
00:57:55,596 --> 00:57:57,136
and she had to believe me.

859
00:57:57,304 --> 00:57:59,094
Has there ever been an open space

860
00:57:59,263 --> 00:58:01,632
where you weren't overcome
by anxiety?

861
00:58:01,804 --> 00:58:06,545
Only one. During a school trip
to Prague. I was 14.

862
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:09,007
The square
with the astronomical clock.

863
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:13,173
I must have walked across it
a hundred times. It was beautiful.

864
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:16,629
I remember a restaurant
with very strange decor.

865
00:58:17,846 --> 00:58:21,294
If there's one place in the world
I'm nostalgic for, it's that.

866
00:58:21,471 --> 00:58:22,928
I was really happy there.

867
00:58:24,346 --> 00:58:26,751
It was called Night and Day.

868
00:58:28,221 --> 00:58:31,172
- You've never been back?
- Never.

869
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:36,376
Why not go now?
I'd be happy to take you.

870
00:58:41,513 --> 00:58:45,506
Well, you don't seem too pleased.
We're almost there.

871
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:49,921
Our automaton is about
to emerge from the shadows.

872
00:58:50,096 --> 00:58:52,501
No, I'm delighted.
You're a force of nature.

873
00:58:54,804 --> 00:58:56,048
It's just that...

874
00:58:57,221 --> 00:58:59,010
...this is one of those evenings

875
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:01,715
when one feels like this contraption
here...

876
00:59:07,763 --> 00:59:08,924
...incomplete.

877
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:13,177
Why did you never marry?
You know, never have kids?

878
00:59:13,471 --> 00:59:14,964
The regard I have for women

879
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:18,135
is equal to the fear
I've always had of them...

880
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,793
...and to my failure
to understand them.

881
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:24,133
If that's the rule, then Miss lbbetson

882
00:59:24,304 --> 00:59:27,752
gives every impression
of being the exception.

883
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:29,091
I'm afraid so.

884
00:59:29,263 --> 00:59:31,965
Have you really never
set eyes on her?

885
00:59:32,137 --> 00:59:33,299
Just once.

886
00:59:34,346 --> 00:59:35,720
What's she like?

887
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:39,549
I suppose feeling a certain interest
in a person

888
00:59:39,721 --> 00:59:43,300
necessarily engenders
a conviction that she's beautiful.

889
00:59:43,471 --> 00:59:45,129
Up to a point.

890
00:59:46,888 --> 00:59:50,549
It's her birthday in two days.
I'd like to get her something useful.

891
00:59:52,013 --> 00:59:54,964
I don't think useful
is probably your best approach.

892
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:56,761
- No?
- Not the first time.

893
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:59,927
It's better to get her something
more... traditional.

894
01:00:05,013 --> 01:00:06,209
Morning, sir.

895
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,463
Hello, sir.

896
01:00:10,804 --> 01:00:13,672
Hey, Mr. Oldman.
Look what I found in the cellar.

897
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:17,216
I saw you were interested
in this old junk.

898
01:00:18,596 --> 01:00:20,717
The supports for
the Murano chandelier.

899
01:00:21,054 --> 01:00:23,009
My colleagues couldn't find them.

900
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:26,379
- I can put them in your car.
- That's very kind.

901
01:00:28,138 --> 01:00:29,381
Wait.

902
01:00:31,138 --> 01:00:32,299
Oh, thanks.

903
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:35,793
Morning, Mr. Oldman.

904
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:40,794
I took the liberty of remembering
it's your birthday.

905
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,672
Happy birthday, Claire.

906
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:48,385
(Claire) I read
the valuation documents.

907
01:00:48,554 --> 01:00:50,794
Did you manage to understand
some of it?

908
01:00:50,971 --> 01:00:53,008
Of course.
Ridiculous sums of money.

909
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:56,177
Even a backwards child
would know she's being cheated.

910
01:00:56,346 --> 01:00:59,178
They need interpretation.
They're starting bids.

911
01:00:59,346 --> 01:01:02,427
- There'll be higher bids later.
- Suppose there aren't!

912
01:01:02,596 --> 01:01:05,345
Unlikely, but in that case,
we'll even things out.

913
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:07,835
We'll raise the margins
on other pieces.

914
01:01:08,013 --> 01:01:10,631
A gamble? Where I'm the only one
that can lose?

915
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:13,885
You're trying to cheat me.
It's all to your advantage.

916
01:01:14,054 --> 01:01:15,677
You're a fucking thief!

917
01:01:16,846 --> 01:01:19,595
I'm willing to resign
the commission forthwith.

918
01:01:20,804 --> 01:01:21,834
Huh!

919
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,424
I'll have them replace all your
mediocre bric-a-brac immediately.

920
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:30,215
And do me the favour
of disappearing completely

921
01:01:30,388 --> 01:01:31,845
from the face of the earth!

922
01:02:16,429 --> 01:02:17,970
1984, sir.

923
01:02:24,388 --> 01:02:26,343
(mobile phone rings)

924
01:02:34,971 --> 01:02:37,969
- Hello.
- (Claire) I behaved so badly.

925
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:46,344
I feel so stupid. I constantly have
to offer justifications.

926
01:02:48,804 --> 01:02:51,340
I've never been given flowers
before.

927
01:02:51,513 --> 01:02:56,419
I don't know what this says to me.
(sobs)

928
01:02:58,221 --> 01:03:01,882
There's no need for this display
of anguish. I'm not angry with you.

929
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:05,670
(Claire sobs)

930
01:03:05,846 --> 01:03:08,334
My birthdays have always been
so horrible.

931
01:03:10,179 --> 01:03:11,885
And you...

932
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,511
Since you came along...

933
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:17,589
...you've turned my life upside down.

934
01:03:20,304 --> 01:03:23,053
The other day, I went downstairs.

935
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:28,298
I opened the main door
and looked out onto the garden.

936
01:03:29,971 --> 01:03:32,424
- Did you go out?
- No.

937
01:03:34,304 --> 01:03:36,094
I was afraid.

938
01:03:36,263 --> 01:03:37,803
I felt terrible.

939
01:03:39,638 --> 01:03:41,758
But I never even got that far before.

940
01:03:45,804 --> 01:03:47,345
Do you want me to come over?

941
01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:50,885
I already know it's pointless.

942
01:03:51,054 --> 01:03:54,135
There are new treatments
nowadays. They might help you.

943
01:03:54,304 --> 01:03:56,591
I'd rather talk to you
than to some shrink.

944
01:03:58,054 --> 01:04:00,969
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Yes.

945
01:04:04,638 --> 01:04:07,208
I see you brought up
the portrait of the dancer.

946
01:04:07,388 --> 01:04:10,136
- It's something I want to keep.
- No great value.

947
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:13,255
(laughs) It's a portrait of my mother.

948
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:15,633
She was about my age
when she had it done.

949
01:04:19,763 --> 01:04:21,172
Do you look like her?

950
01:04:21,346 --> 01:04:24,842
- She was prettier, I can assure you.
- I cannot judge.

951
01:04:34,388 --> 01:04:35,880
Alright, Claire. I'll go.

952
01:04:36,054 --> 01:04:39,254
Don't hesitate to call
if you need anything at all.

953
01:04:39,429 --> 01:04:41,503
Thank you, Mr. Oldman.
See you soon, I hope.

954
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:20,053
(door slams)

955
01:05:23,971 --> 01:05:25,629
(phone rings)

956
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:32,385
(Claire) Hello? Oh, it's you, director.

957
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:35,251
No, I would've called you,
it's just that...

958
01:05:35,429 --> 01:05:38,261
...clearing the furniture
has been complicated.

959
01:05:39,721 --> 01:05:42,091
Yes. Oldman is dealing with it.

960
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:46,751
What's he like?
Not as old as you might think.

961
01:05:47,138 --> 01:05:50,882
He dresses in an odd way,
but he's still a good-looking man.

962
01:05:51,263 --> 01:05:53,218
I know I can trust him.

963
01:05:53,388 --> 01:05:56,718
(laughs) Why? Are you jealous?

964
01:05:57,346 --> 01:06:00,178
In love? No, I don't think so.

965
01:06:00,388 --> 01:06:03,136
He's too put off by my illness,
like everybody.

966
01:06:03,304 --> 01:06:05,129
(loud crash, Claire exclaims)

967
01:06:05,304 --> 01:06:07,709
Oh no, it's nothing.
I... I hurt my foot.

968
01:06:08,054 --> 01:06:09,713
Can we talk later?

969
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,220
(groans)

970
01:06:35,346 --> 01:06:36,590
Who is it?

971
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:39,011
Who's there?

972
01:06:40,013 --> 01:06:42,548
No, get out!
No, please, get out!

973
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:45,257
(shouts) Go away! Get out!

974
01:06:45,638 --> 01:06:48,635
Get out! Please, leave me alone!

975
01:06:50,513 --> 01:06:52,053
(screams) Get out!

976
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:56,261
(voice echoes) Get out!

977
01:07:02,888 --> 01:07:05,376
(phone rings)

978
01:07:11,429 --> 01:07:15,375
- Hello?
- (Claire) Please, help me, please.

979
01:07:15,638 --> 01:07:18,208
Calm down, Claire.
What's happened?

980
01:07:18,471 --> 01:07:21,173
You have to help me!
Help me!

981
01:07:21,429 --> 01:07:24,344
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Please.

982
01:07:28,388 --> 01:07:30,461
(breathes heavily)

983
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:10,168
(pants)

984
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,470
Claire!

985
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,625
- It's me. I'm here. What's happened?
- There's somebody in the house!

986
01:08:25,846 --> 01:08:28,879
- Please get them out!
- Calm down. There's nobody here.

987
01:08:29,054 --> 01:08:31,424
- There's someone in the house!
- Calm down.

988
01:08:31,763 --> 01:08:34,796
It was me before, Claire.
It was me.

989
01:08:36,387 --> 01:08:37,928
It was me.

990
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:43,250
I hid in the room so I could see you.

991
01:08:45,762 --> 01:08:47,220
You were spying on me?

992
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:50,420
(angrily) You were spying on me?

993
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:52,470
(shouts) Get out!

994
01:08:52,638 --> 01:08:55,754
I want nothing more to do with you!
Get out!

995
01:09:04,334 --> 01:09:05,792
(door opens)

996
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:08,448
(Claire) Please, Virgil. Don't go.

997
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:12,992
(Claire sobs)

998
01:09:26,209 --> 01:09:29,326
Believe me,
I don't normally behave like this...

999
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:32,458
(Claire) Neither do I.

1000
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:36,576
So I'm bound to make some
mistakes...

1001
01:09:39,043 --> 01:09:42,574
...but nothing in the world
would make me want to hurt you.

1002
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:47,033
It's just that I can't help myself.

1003
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,123
I need to see you.

1004
01:10:27,668 --> 01:10:29,493
(Virgil) You should've seen her.

1005
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:33,660
Pale, like a Durer etching.

1006
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:37,540
She had the look of some creature
terrified of the universe.

1007
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:40,625
And I could read my own terror
in her eyes.

1008
01:10:40,959 --> 01:10:45,498
Every man on earth would like to be
as terrified as you at this moment.

1009
01:10:48,668 --> 01:10:50,208
(sighs)

1010
01:10:53,626 --> 01:10:56,410
- You've worked a miracle.
- It's too soon to tell.

1011
01:10:56,793 --> 01:11:00,454
And you be careful, alright?
This is when mistakes occur.

1012
01:11:00,793 --> 01:11:02,748
When you think you've made it,

1013
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:04,916
that is when you lose strategy.

1014
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:09,197
- And what strategy would that be?
- Never stop surprising them.

1015
01:11:09,376 --> 01:11:13,998
Do things they couldn't have
foreseen. Take a gamble, run a risk.

1016
01:11:14,334 --> 01:11:17,167
You're asking me to behave
in a way that isn't me.

1017
01:11:17,501 --> 01:11:19,575
That's why you have to do it.

1018
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,125
As long as you're playing
according to her rules,

1019
01:11:23,293 --> 01:11:26,493
you're always gonna make her
feel like... like a patient.

1020
01:11:26,668 --> 01:11:29,073
She needs to be treated
like a woman.

1021
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:01,908
What do you think? Do you like it?

1022
01:12:05,751 --> 01:12:07,292
I don't know.

1023
01:12:08,584 --> 01:12:10,125
What do you think?

1024
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,117
lt looks marvellous on you, Claire.

1025
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:15,499
Perhaps the smaller size?

1026
01:12:16,376 --> 01:12:18,995
Yes. I think so too.

1027
01:12:32,709 --> 01:12:35,542
It's been a long time
since I got a present like this.

1028
01:12:37,168 --> 01:12:40,580
- Long overdue, don't you think?
- I don't know.

1029
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,708
(sighs) I'm a little,
you know, taken a back.

1030
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:49,283
(footsteps approach)

1031
01:12:50,751 --> 01:12:52,789
- I'm sorry, I can't...
- What?

1032
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:55,906
Oh, certainly.

1033
01:12:56,793 --> 01:12:59,707
I'm sorry.
I didn't understand.

1034
01:13:08,293 --> 01:13:11,374
I don't honestly know
if I deserve all this.

1035
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:17,163
(Virgil) Let me be the judge of that.

1036
01:13:35,668 --> 01:13:38,334
If we don't set a date
for the Stockholm auction,

1037
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:39,994
they'll shoot themselves.

1038
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:42,656
It's too far.
Let them shoot themselves.

1039
01:13:45,418 --> 01:13:48,581
We have to schedule the meeting
with the Hermitage

1040
01:13:48,918 --> 01:13:51,667
and the auctions in
San Francisco and Madrid.

1041
01:13:51,834 --> 01:13:53,292
Ditto. Too far away.

1042
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:57,116
- We can't abandon them.
- There are auctioneers galore.

1043
01:13:57,293 --> 01:14:00,207
They'll find someone else
and it will cost them less.

1044
01:14:00,376 --> 01:14:01,655
As you wish.

1045
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:09,164
Lambert, are you married?

1046
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:12,538
Yes. Nearly 30 years.

1047
01:14:12,876 --> 01:14:15,411
What's it like, living with a woman?

1048
01:14:15,793 --> 01:14:17,665
Like taking part in an auction.

1049
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:21,498
You never know if yours
will be the best offer.

1050
01:14:48,293 --> 01:14:49,869
- This one.
- Very well, sir.

1051
01:14:51,626 --> 01:14:54,541
What do you think?
Have I made myself pretty?

1052
01:14:56,334 --> 01:14:58,823
- Beautiful. You've done very well.
- Liar.

1053
01:14:59,001 --> 01:15:01,371
- Claire.
- I haven't done this for years.

1054
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:04,707
I've forgotten how to do it.
I look like a monster.

1055
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:07,791
Trust me. Some practice
and you'll be wonderful.

1056
01:15:07,959 --> 01:15:10,413
And you'll take me to
one of your auctions,

1057
01:15:10,584 --> 01:15:12,492
and to galas with elegant people,

1058
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:16,282
and to the most refined restaurants
in the world.

1059
01:15:16,626 --> 01:15:20,620
That's the reason for your
presents, isn't it, Virgil?

1060
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:24,831
To help me recover little by little,
and then take me out.

1061
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:26,957
Isn't that right?

1062
01:15:29,376 --> 01:15:30,833
No!

1063
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:33,241
Claire. Don't be like this.
Let's talk.

1064
01:15:33,543 --> 01:15:35,617
(loud rock music)

1065
01:15:37,501 --> 01:15:41,744
Maybe we did get the last moves
wrong. I was a bit rash.

1066
01:15:42,126 --> 01:15:43,619
Don't blame yourself.

1067
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:47,158
It's always her who manages
to pull everything apart.

1068
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,705
Robert. My aunt's gone missing
again.

1069
01:15:49,876 --> 01:15:51,582
- You're kidding.
- Pardon me.

1070
01:15:51,918 --> 01:15:55,034
- We found her in Central Park.
- I'm sorry, Terry.

1071
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:58,124
It was no good
trying to reset this thing.

1072
01:15:58,293 --> 01:16:01,623
It was much more easy
just to make a new one.

1073
01:16:01,793 --> 01:16:04,328
This one has a much wider range.

1074
01:16:04,668 --> 01:16:06,991
She can go off
and you won't lose touch.

1075
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:09,870
Just make sure
you reprogram the PC, okay?

1076
01:16:10,043 --> 01:16:12,199
I can manage that.
You're an angel.

1077
01:16:13,126 --> 01:16:14,916
- Thanks, darling.
- No worries.

1078
01:16:15,793 --> 01:16:18,625
- I'll see you tomorrow night, yeah?
- Yeah.

1079
01:16:20,793 --> 01:16:25,995
You need an idea that'll excite her
but at the same time reassure her.

1080
01:16:26,209 --> 01:16:30,783
Yes, but she'll still see through it
as some deceitful therapy.

1081
01:16:31,084 --> 01:16:34,450
- You should invite her to dinner.
- Yes! Noma in Copenhagen!

1082
01:16:34,793 --> 01:16:37,328
At the climax of the evening,
by candlelight,

1083
01:16:37,668 --> 01:16:39,954
tell her that she's beautiful.

1084
01:16:40,293 --> 01:16:42,414
And after
you'll have coffee with us?

1085
01:16:42,751 --> 01:16:44,292
Why not?

1086
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:50,582
Joking apart, I'd be glad
if you did see her, hear her talk.

1087
01:16:50,959 --> 01:16:53,792
I'm sure you'd understand
far more than I.

1088
01:16:55,584 --> 01:16:57,622
Who said anything about joking?

1089
01:16:59,168 --> 01:17:03,375
(Woman) 129,403.

1090
01:17:03,543 --> 01:17:05,249
BARMAN: Your champagne.

1091
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:07,914
- Thank you.
- (man) Calculate this.

1092
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:14,831
(Woman) 12,624,831.333.

1093
01:17:15,168 --> 01:17:17,075
- (door closes)
- (patron cheers)

1094
01:17:17,251 --> 01:17:18,792
(man) Unbelievable!

1095
01:17:24,334 --> 01:17:25,910
You're radiant, Claire.

1096
01:17:27,959 --> 01:17:29,369
You did all this?

1097
01:17:29,543 --> 01:17:32,245
I can turn my hand
to interior decorating.

1098
01:17:41,209 --> 01:17:44,705
You've done a wonderful job, Virgil.
Thank you.

1099
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:54,241
I can't tell you how long I've wanted
to spend time alone with you.

1100
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:58,080
Somewhere quiet,
far from the madding crowd.

1101
01:17:58,293 --> 01:18:00,367
(Claire giggles)

1102
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:02,542
(pours drink)

1103
01:18:03,501 --> 01:18:05,575
(Virgil) To your serenity, Claire.

1104
01:18:08,168 --> 01:18:09,874
To your irony, Virgil.

1105
01:18:15,918 --> 01:18:18,288
- Now I feel I can finally tell you.
- What?

1106
01:18:18,626 --> 01:18:21,161
You are more beautiful than the
dancer.

1107
01:18:23,876 --> 01:18:25,369
VIRGIL: Dinner is served.

1108
01:18:25,751 --> 01:18:28,240
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.

1109
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:30,954
I warn you, as a waiter
I'm not the best.

1110
01:18:31,293 --> 01:18:33,663
I offer no guarantees.

1111
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:37,493
- I'll take the risk.
- Somewhat foolhardy of you.

1112
01:18:38,126 --> 01:18:41,159
- Why?
- lf the service is not to your liking,

1113
01:18:41,334 --> 01:18:43,491
next time I'd have to
make a reservation

1114
01:18:43,668 --> 01:18:45,291
at the best restaurant in town.

1115
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:50,080
Let's not ruin this evening, Virgil.

1116
01:18:50,251 --> 01:18:53,699
- Please, let's not talk about me.
- Alright.

1117
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:56,709
Instead I'd like you to tell me
about your past.

1118
01:18:57,084 --> 01:19:00,284
You see, there's nothing
very original about my life.

1119
01:19:00,626 --> 01:19:03,743
A child loses his parents,
a horrible orphanage...

1120
01:19:04,084 --> 01:19:07,497
The only point of interest is
that the nuns would punish the boy

1121
01:19:07,668 --> 01:19:11,080
by making him work with a restorer
who had a workshop there.

1122
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:13,159
That's beautiful.

1123
01:19:13,334 --> 01:19:15,539
He loved to observe
this craftsman,

1124
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:19,538
so the little boy got up to
all sorts of mischief

1125
01:19:19,709 --> 01:19:22,624
to ensure he'd be punished
as often as possible.

1126
01:19:22,793 --> 01:19:24,618
So he became acquainted with art,

1127
01:19:24,959 --> 01:19:28,740
techniques of painting,
how to tell a forgery from an original

1128
01:19:28,918 --> 01:19:30,707
etc., etc.

1129
01:19:30,876 --> 01:19:35,866
(Claire) In an old article of yours
I found on the internet, you said,

1130
01:19:36,209 --> 01:19:39,456
"There's something authentic
in every forgery."

1131
01:19:39,793 --> 01:19:41,202
What did you mean?

1132
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:43,450
When simulating another's work

1133
01:19:43,834 --> 01:19:47,745
the forger can't resist the temptation
to put in something of himself.

1134
01:19:47,918 --> 01:19:51,034
Often it's just a trifle,
a detail of no interest.

1135
01:19:51,376 --> 01:19:52,952
One unsuspected stroke,

1136
01:19:53,126 --> 01:19:56,373
by which the forger inevitably
ends up betraying himself,

1137
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:59,992
and revealing his own,
utterly authentic sensibilities.

1138
01:20:00,959 --> 01:20:03,199
I really love the way you talk.

1139
01:20:03,543 --> 01:20:05,913
You couldn't have been
more convincing.

1140
01:20:06,084 --> 01:20:07,874
Huh? A born seducer.

1141
01:20:08,209 --> 01:20:12,250
- So you'd give me a pass?
- A+. With distinction!

1142
01:20:12,584 --> 01:20:15,203
Sorry, you've been
a bit neglected lately.

1143
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:19,620
You haven't said
anything about Claire.

1144
01:20:20,418 --> 01:20:24,079
If I didn't know about her problems,
I'd say she was normal.

1145
01:20:24,459 --> 01:20:27,790
And she's much more beautiful
than you described.

1146
01:20:28,126 --> 01:20:30,579
Really. I liked her.

1147
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:32,706
You're going to make me jealous?

1148
01:20:32,876 --> 01:20:36,123
lf you want my advice,
you pray that girl never gets better.

1149
01:20:36,459 --> 01:20:39,030
Do you want lots 87 and 88
done separately?

1150
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:41,579
No, together. That's important.

1151
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,950
How can I help you?

1152
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:54,073
- It's about Robert.
- What's going on?

1153
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:57,458
Don't be afraid to tell me.

1154
01:20:59,584 --> 01:21:02,417
We're not getting on so well,
that's the problem.

1155
01:21:02,751 --> 01:21:05,121
All those girls hovering around him...

1156
01:21:06,376 --> 01:21:07,917
I guess I'm just...

1157
01:21:08,501 --> 01:21:10,124
...l'm afraid of losing him.

1158
01:21:11,209 --> 01:21:13,081
Is there anything I can do?

1159
01:21:14,418 --> 01:21:15,958
Do you want me to talk to him?

1160
01:21:18,084 --> 01:21:22,208
For a while now he's been
talking about someone called Claire.

1161
01:21:24,668 --> 01:21:26,208
Claire?

1162
01:21:27,168 --> 01:21:29,040
I don't understand

1163
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:33,618
With him everybody's got to
be on their guard, all the time.

1164
01:21:33,959 --> 01:21:35,701
That goes for you, too.

1165
01:21:36,584 --> 01:21:38,291
(Sarah sobs)

1166
01:21:38,626 --> 01:21:40,498
I feel so stupid.

1167
01:21:43,793 --> 01:21:46,162
Promise me you won't say a word
to him.

1168
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:48,909
I promise.

1169
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:56,614
(Robert) Have you been
waiting long?

1170
01:21:56,793 --> 01:21:59,542
lf you'd phoned,
I wouldn't have kept you waiting.

1171
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:02,376
- I prefer to see you.
- Is something wrong?

1172
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:04,617
My assistant will come by today.

1173
01:22:04,793 --> 01:22:07,791
Kindly hand over the
Vaucanson as it is.

1174
01:22:07,959 --> 01:22:10,033
Alright. Whatever you want.

1175
01:22:10,376 --> 01:22:12,865
Tell him how much you're owed.
He'll pay you.

1176
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:16,914
Aren't I at least due an explanation?

1177
01:22:17,084 --> 01:22:20,035
You're not the trustworthy man
I thought you were.

1178
01:22:22,043 --> 01:22:25,408
(Claire) lt's weird seeing them so
perfect and polished up.

1179
01:22:25,751 --> 01:22:27,208
It's as if they weren't mine.

1180
01:22:38,418 --> 01:22:40,455
I believe nothing is missing.

1181
01:22:41,626 --> 01:22:43,249
There is something missing.

1182
01:23:03,793 --> 01:23:07,952
How could you have lived
the best years of your life in here?

1183
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:11,826
I don't know. I don't know.

1184
01:23:12,543 --> 01:23:14,083
It was just the right thing.

1185
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:19,119
"Was."

1186
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:22,458
lt still is.

1187
01:23:22,793 --> 01:23:24,333
It always will be.

1188
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:26,625
Always.

1189
01:23:33,668 --> 01:23:37,365
You have to get out of here.
You have to do it by yourself.

1190
01:23:38,376 --> 01:23:40,248
I don't have the courage.

1191
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:45,665
It's a spider's web that
I don't know how to break free of.

1192
01:23:50,126 --> 01:23:52,531
It's an old collection
my father was fond of.

1193
01:23:52,876 --> 01:23:54,997
I never did understand what it was.

1194
01:23:55,918 --> 01:23:58,241
- (phone rings)
- (Claire sighs)

1195
01:24:02,168 --> 01:24:04,870
(Claire) Hello?
Good morning, director.

1196
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:07,831
Yes, I'm nearly finished.

1197
01:24:08,584 --> 01:24:11,073
But I would like to rewrite
the last chapter.

1198
01:24:11,751 --> 01:24:13,825
A more upbeat ending.

1199
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:17,790
If that's all you want...

1200
01:24:18,626 --> 01:24:21,541
Yes. Talk to you soon. Thanks.

1201
01:24:22,376 --> 01:24:23,538
(Claire hangs up)

1202
01:24:23,876 --> 01:24:27,242
I wouldn't rule out them
being part of something valuable,

1203
01:24:27,418 --> 01:24:29,455
but exactly what I couldn't say.

1204
01:24:29,793 --> 01:24:32,281
- I often wonder if...
- What?

1205
01:24:32,584 --> 01:24:35,499
lf you're more interested
in my furniture than in me.

1206
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:39,325
How could you say that?

1207
01:24:41,168 --> 01:24:44,082
I shouldn't have let you in here.
I shouldn't have.

1208
01:25:07,626 --> 01:25:10,079
I've found all the missing pieces.

1209
01:25:10,376 --> 01:25:12,663
How do you feel about
finishing the job?

1210
01:25:13,543 --> 01:25:15,450
Well, it's your problem.

1211
01:25:15,793 --> 01:25:17,451
(crackling of solder)

1212
01:25:17,626 --> 01:25:19,664
Sarah came to see me
a few days ago.

1213
01:25:19,834 --> 01:25:22,074
She was upset
about your relationship.

1214
01:25:25,543 --> 01:25:29,951
- Are you here to advise me now?
- No, you're the expert on women.

1215
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,959
Alright.
We can pick up where we left off.

1216
01:25:34,293 --> 01:25:35,454
On two conditions.

1217
01:25:35,793 --> 01:25:39,454
You just stop involving me
in your private life.

1218
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:41,788
And the second?

1219
01:25:47,626 --> 01:25:49,083
Is that you take this back.

1220
01:25:54,501 --> 01:25:58,116
I didn't get excited about
your Vaucanson for the money.

1221
01:26:01,584 --> 01:26:03,492
I brought it back. It's in the car.

1222
01:26:03,834 --> 01:26:05,659
And the new pieces too?

1223
01:26:06,001 --> 01:26:10,077
You'll have to be patient for those.
They're tied up with my private life.

1224
01:26:10,418 --> 01:26:13,250
I don't know
and I don't want to know.

1225
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:18,750
If you were forced to choose
between Claire and the automaton,

1226
01:26:19,084 --> 01:26:20,992
which would you take?

1227
01:26:28,376 --> 01:26:31,742
- This one.
- An excellent choice, Mr. Oldman.

1228
01:26:32,084 --> 01:26:33,411
If it's the wrong size,

1229
01:26:33,584 --> 01:26:36,701
please inform the lady to pass by
whenever she wishes.

1230
01:26:36,876 --> 01:26:38,582
Thank you, I'll let her know.

1231
01:26:38,918 --> 01:26:40,624
Claire? lt's me.

1232
01:26:55,959 --> 01:27:00,700
- (rock music playing)
- Claire! I've brought lunch.

1233
01:27:10,334 --> 01:27:11,875
Claire!

1234
01:27:13,501 --> 01:27:18,324
- (suspenseful music)
- Claire, answer me!

1235
01:27:20,043 --> 01:27:21,583
Claire!

1236
01:27:23,293 --> 01:27:24,833
Claire!

1237
01:27:26,668 --> 01:27:28,208
Claire!

1238
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:35,410
Are you down here?

1239
01:27:40,918 --> 01:27:43,620
(shouts) Claire!
(echoes)

1240
01:28:19,334 --> 01:28:21,325
Have any of you seen a woman

1241
01:28:21,501 --> 01:28:24,416
going out the gate
of the villa across the road?

1242
01:28:24,584 --> 01:28:26,042
No, I can't say I have.

1243
01:28:26,376 --> 01:28:29,409
Has anybody seen someone
coming out of the villa?

1244
01:28:29,751 --> 01:28:32,500
A young woman.
Medium height, light hair.

1245
01:28:32,834 --> 01:28:35,323
- A bit pale.
- I think I saw her.

1246
01:28:35,668 --> 01:28:36,947
I didn't see her go out,

1247
01:28:37,126 --> 01:28:39,330
but she was walking away
from the gate.

1248
01:28:39,668 --> 01:28:41,954
- When?
- This morning at breakfast.

1249
01:28:42,293 --> 01:28:45,456
- What else can you tell me?
- She seemed a bit weird.

1250
01:28:45,793 --> 01:28:50,118
- Weird? Which way did she go?
- That way. Towards the park.

1251
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:52,201
231.

1252
01:28:52,543 --> 01:28:55,790
- (tires screech, horn sounds)
- (driver, angrily) Idiot!

1253
01:28:55,959 --> 01:28:57,784
(ring tone)

1254
01:28:57,959 --> 01:29:00,164
- (Robert) Hello? Virgil?
- She's gone.

1255
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:02,953
- Who? What's going on?
- Claire's disappeared.

1256
01:29:03,126 --> 01:29:05,994
I've looked.
They saw her leave this morning.

1257
01:29:06,334 --> 01:29:08,657
- Do you want me to come over?
- Please.

1258
01:29:11,543 --> 01:29:13,083
Has this happened before?

1259
01:29:13,251 --> 01:29:15,407
She never even appeared
at the windows.

1260
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:17,125
Just behind the shutters.

1261
01:29:17,459 --> 01:29:19,699
Did she have friends
she could go to?

1262
01:29:20,043 --> 01:29:24,332
She'd talk to people on her
computer under different names.

1263
01:29:24,668 --> 01:29:28,247
- She can't have gone far.
- Let's hope so.

1264
01:29:28,584 --> 01:29:30,622
I've already been round three times.

1265
01:29:30,793 --> 01:29:33,079
(phone rings)

1266
01:29:33,251 --> 01:29:35,041
- Hello?
- (Lambert) Mr. Oldman.

1267
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:37,994
- Listen, has Miss lbbetson phoned?
- No.

1268
01:29:38,168 --> 01:29:40,870
- lf she calls, let me know.
- I will.

1269
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:44,823
Mr. Oldman, I wouldn't like
to think you'd forgotten.

1270
01:29:45,001 --> 01:29:46,873
Forgotten what?

1271
01:29:47,209 --> 01:29:49,911
(crowd murmurs)

1272
01:29:54,293 --> 01:29:57,705
- (man) There he is. Here we go.
- Lot number one.

1273
01:29:58,043 --> 01:30:02,083
Late Baroque, Venetian,
mid-18th-century mirror.

1274
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:04,372
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,

1275
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:07,707
with adornments,
floral motifs and festoons.

1276
01:30:08,043 --> 01:30:09,749
(speak indistinctly)

1277
01:30:09,918 --> 01:30:11,458
Upper frame richly...

1278
01:30:16,168 --> 01:30:18,040
(sighs)

1279
01:30:19,709 --> 01:30:22,458
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,
with adornments,

1280
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,368
floral motifs and festoons.

1281
01:30:24,543 --> 01:30:26,913
Upper frame richly
engraved with whirls.

1282
01:30:27,084 --> 01:30:28,542
Can we say 130,000 euros?

1283
01:30:29,668 --> 01:30:31,244
140,000 euros.

1284
01:30:31,584 --> 01:30:33,907
150,000 euros.
Gentleman on my left.

1285
01:30:34,084 --> 01:30:36,122
160,000 euros. Lady up the back.

1286
01:30:36,501 --> 01:30:40,625
170,000 euros.
180,000 euros on the telephone.

1287
01:30:40,959 --> 01:30:44,539
200,000 euros.
Gentleman on my left in the room.

1288
01:30:44,709 --> 01:30:46,914
220,000 euros.

1289
01:30:47,084 --> 01:30:50,201
250,000 euros on the tele...
(PHONE RINGS)

1290
01:30:50,543 --> 01:30:53,576
(Fred) Still nothing, Mr. Oldman.
I'll keep looking.

1291
01:30:53,751 --> 01:30:56,370
- Robert's looking further afield.
- Alright.

1292
01:30:56,543 --> 01:30:59,327
- I'll call you later.
- Alright

1293
01:31:01,709 --> 01:31:04,411
- He's gone crazy.
- 280,000.

1294
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,872
310,000. Any more?

1295
01:31:07,751 --> 01:31:10,038
- Sold!
- (phone rings)

1296
01:31:10,376 --> 01:31:14,240
(Robert) I'm doing the rounds
of the hospitals, but there's nothing.

1297
01:31:14,418 --> 01:31:15,615
Just keep looking.

1298
01:31:15,793 --> 01:31:18,411
- We'll find her. I'll keep in touch.
- Thanks.

1299
01:31:19,459 --> 01:31:21,035
Lot number 2.

1300
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:24,124
A 17th-century
Fassadenschranke wardrobe

1301
01:31:24,293 --> 01:31:26,118
in walnut, maple, oak and ash.

1302
01:31:26,293 --> 01:31:28,959
The carved frame
surmounts an inlaid stripe,

1303
01:31:29,293 --> 01:31:32,575
and two doors engraved
with architectural motifs,

1304
01:31:32,918 --> 01:31:34,908
surrounded by carvings of fruit.

1305
01:31:35,251 --> 01:31:38,368
Three spiralled,
tapered columns flank the doors.

1306
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:41,743
(crowd laughs)
The lower body has two drawers.

1307
01:31:42,084 --> 01:31:43,542
(crowd laughs)

1308
01:31:44,751 --> 01:31:45,948
And um...

1309
01:31:50,501 --> 01:31:53,618
There's nothing for it
but to call the police.

1310
01:31:53,793 --> 01:31:56,660
It'll be all over the papers.
They'll drag me into it.

1311
01:31:56,834 --> 01:31:58,292
Let's wait a bit longer.

1312
01:31:58,626 --> 01:32:00,202
What do you hope will happen?

1313
01:32:00,543 --> 01:32:03,873
That she'll come back... or turn up.

1314
01:32:05,209 --> 01:32:07,876
Or they'll find out where she is.

1315
01:32:08,043 --> 01:32:11,788
Someone with her problems
doesn't just disappear into thin air.

1316
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:14,033
Well, that depends.

1317
01:32:14,376 --> 01:32:16,248
No matter how deeply rooted it is,

1318
01:32:16,418 --> 01:32:19,202
sometimes a phobia
can just disappear by itself.

1319
01:32:19,543 --> 01:32:21,201
So, why did she run away?

1320
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,497
Maybe something happened
between you

1321
01:32:23,834 --> 01:32:26,405
that drove her
to take that kind of decision.

1322
01:32:26,584 --> 01:32:29,867
You know perfectly well
that's impossible.

1323
01:32:30,043 --> 01:32:32,875
You're the only person
who knows everything

1324
01:32:33,043 --> 01:32:34,749
that happened between us.

1325
01:32:36,168 --> 01:32:38,123
(engine revs outside)

1326
01:32:38,293 --> 01:32:40,532
Excuse me a minute.

1327
01:32:40,709 --> 01:32:42,250
(door opens)

1328
01:32:43,584 --> 01:32:45,125
(door closes)

1329
01:32:46,793 --> 01:32:48,748
(indistinct arguing outside)

1330
01:32:51,793 --> 01:32:53,700
(indistinct arguing)

1331
01:32:57,501 --> 01:32:59,657
(phone rings)

1332
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:02,999
- Hello?
- (Lambert) I'm sorry, Mr. Oldman.

1333
01:33:03,168 --> 01:33:05,573
I've called
all the publishers in existence

1334
01:33:05,751 --> 01:33:07,789
but none of them knows
who she is.

1335
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:10,199
They said that often
even they don't know

1336
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:13,540
the identity of authors
who use pseudonyms.

1337
01:33:13,876 --> 01:33:16,032
I'd never have guessed that you

1338
01:33:16,209 --> 01:33:18,663
would have ended up
in a mess like this.

1339
01:33:18,834 --> 01:33:22,615
- I don't know how I can help you.
- All you had to do was listen.

1340
01:33:22,959 --> 01:33:25,116
Ah.

1341
01:33:25,293 --> 01:33:29,749
Considering the lady's illness,
it seems highly unrealistic

1342
01:33:30,084 --> 01:33:31,909
that she's just run away.

1343
01:33:33,209 --> 01:33:37,618
I'd say, I don't know,
she'd been abducted or something.

1344
01:33:37,959 --> 01:33:40,874
That's not likely.
I don't think she had any enemies.

1345
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:44,575
It could be somebody became
so besotted with her

1346
01:33:44,751 --> 01:33:46,327
and carried her off by force.

1347
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:50,080
- But who?
- I've had my doubts about Robert.

1348
01:33:50,418 --> 01:33:51,448
The young guy?

1349
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:54,791
The way you describe him,
he doesn't seem the type.

1350
01:33:55,126 --> 01:33:58,290
From the literary point of view,
he fits the bill.

1351
01:33:59,418 --> 01:34:01,455
The young knight
rescuing the damsel

1352
01:34:01,626 --> 01:34:05,074
from the clutches of the old man
incapable of love.

1353
01:34:05,418 --> 01:34:08,167
Literature, exactly.

1354
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:10,492
Don't go overboard, Virgil.

1355
01:34:10,834 --> 01:34:14,117
She could have had her own reasons
for disappearing.

1356
01:34:14,459 --> 01:34:16,948
I can't imagine what reasons.

1357
01:34:17,293 --> 01:34:20,493
Recently, she's been experiencing
emotions and feelings

1358
01:34:20,668 --> 01:34:22,954
that are incompatible with flight.

1359
01:34:23,293 --> 01:34:25,283
I wouldn't be so sure,
if I were you.

1360
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:28,115
Human emotions
are like works of art.

1361
01:34:28,459 --> 01:34:30,166
They can be forged.

1362
01:34:30,334 --> 01:34:34,245
They seem just like the original,
but they're a forgery.

1363
01:34:36,793 --> 01:34:40,739
- Forgery?
- Everything can be faked, Virgil.

1364
01:34:41,084 --> 01:34:44,035
Joy, pain, hate.

1365
01:34:45,584 --> 01:34:48,038
Illness, recovery.

1366
01:34:49,584 --> 01:34:51,658
Even love.

1367
01:35:06,793 --> 01:35:09,328
(phone rings)

1368
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:11,243
- Hello?
- (Robert) Listen.

1369
01:35:11,418 --> 01:35:13,953
There's something
that hadn't occurred to us.

1370
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:18,167
Are you sure there are
no other secret rooms in the villa?

1371
01:35:18,334 --> 01:35:20,455
FRED: I don't remember
any other doors

1372
01:35:20,626 --> 01:35:22,830
like the one to Miss lbbetson's room.

1373
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:26,491
Claire!

1374
01:35:26,668 --> 01:35:31,372
The only place we haven't looked at
is the attic... if you want?

1375
01:35:37,334 --> 01:35:40,167
(Virgil) Did you know
that Miss Claire was a writer?

1376
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:42,905
(Fred) I heard her parents
talk about it.

1377
01:35:43,084 --> 01:35:46,118
(Virgil) She used a pseudonym
for her books.

1378
01:35:46,293 --> 01:35:50,203
(Fred) I never knew that.
I've never seen the books.

1379
01:35:50,543 --> 01:35:52,284
She never wanted them here.

1380
01:35:52,626 --> 01:35:54,000
(Virgil) Claire!

1381
01:35:55,293 --> 01:35:58,575
(Fred) We're wasting time.
There are no other secret rooms.

1382
01:35:58,751 --> 01:36:00,327
(Claire) You've come back.

1383
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:02,326
- (Fred) We should...
- Quiet!

1384
01:36:02,668 --> 01:36:03,995
(Claire) You've...

1385
01:36:05,168 --> 01:36:06,577
You've come back.

1386
01:36:06,751 --> 01:36:08,623
You've...

1387
01:36:10,668 --> 01:36:12,493
You've come back.

1388
01:36:12,834 --> 01:36:14,208
You've...

1389
01:36:14,376 --> 01:36:16,034
Claire?

1390
01:36:21,376 --> 01:36:25,073
Claire, I can feel you're there.
Answer me.

1391
01:36:27,543 --> 01:36:29,035
(Claire) You've come back.

1392
01:36:31,876 --> 01:36:34,957
- You've come back.
- Of course I have.

1393
01:36:36,293 --> 01:36:37,951
Were you afraid I wouldn't?

1394
01:36:42,543 --> 01:36:44,415
(door opens)

1395
01:36:49,918 --> 01:36:52,869
(Claire) I thought
you'd abandoned me.

1396
01:36:53,043 --> 01:36:56,539
- Like last time.
- Last time?

1397
01:36:56,876 --> 01:36:59,708
When we got back from Prague.

1398
01:37:02,876 --> 01:37:04,203
Claire.

1399
01:37:26,126 --> 01:37:28,200
I will never abandon you.

1400
01:37:31,751 --> 01:37:35,282
(Claire) I'd been happy in Prague
in that very odd restaurant.

1401
01:37:37,959 --> 01:37:40,874
I was there with my first
and only boyfriend.

1402
01:37:43,043 --> 01:37:44,666
He was older than me.

1403
01:37:49,543 --> 01:37:52,245
When we got back
from that excursion,

1404
01:37:52,418 --> 01:37:55,332
one afternoon,
we were walking in the city centre.

1405
01:37:58,168 --> 01:38:00,242
A car crashed into us.

1406
01:38:01,418 --> 01:38:05,163
When I came to,
he wasn't there anymore.

1407
01:38:24,626 --> 01:38:26,498
(water tinkles)

1408
01:38:26,668 --> 01:38:31,041
I went back home
and I never went out again.

1409
01:38:59,418 --> 01:39:01,574
(Virgil) I've never slept
with a woman.

1410
01:39:01,918 --> 01:39:04,916
In fact, I didn't close my eyes.

1411
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:08,747
I spent the whole night
just looking at her.

1412
01:39:09,084 --> 01:39:13,327
- It was wonderful.
- Well, welcome to the grown-up club.

1413
01:39:13,668 --> 01:39:16,452
You've succeeded
in making her fall in love.

1414
01:39:18,168 --> 01:39:20,040
I had a good teacher.

1415
01:39:22,543 --> 01:39:24,699
I understood where the dwarf hid.

1416
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:27,910
Look, there must have been
a sunken pedestal here.

1417
01:39:28,251 --> 01:39:29,874
He would crouch in there

1418
01:39:30,043 --> 01:39:32,448
and his voice would reverberate
in the body.

1419
01:39:32,626 --> 01:39:34,416
It must have made an impression.

1420
01:39:34,751 --> 01:39:36,872
Do you think love can be faked?

1421
01:39:39,584 --> 01:39:41,456
(scoffs)

1422
01:39:41,626 --> 01:39:44,458
In keeping with what you say
about art forgeries,

1423
01:39:44,793 --> 01:39:47,116
I'd say it can't be completely faked.

1424
01:39:47,459 --> 01:39:49,497
If one could say love is a work of art.

1425
01:39:49,834 --> 01:39:52,323
It'd be amazing if it were,
wouldn't it?

1426
01:39:52,501 --> 01:39:54,373
lt could be sold off at an auction.

1427
01:39:54,709 --> 01:39:58,371
The highest bidder could relive
the greatest love stories.

1428
01:39:58,543 --> 01:40:01,031
I hope I haven't destroyed
your love story.

1429
01:40:01,376 --> 01:40:03,283
No problem. No problem.

1430
01:40:03,626 --> 01:40:06,031
A new valve, two hinges, one fuse...

1431
01:40:06,209 --> 01:40:08,663
It'll be good as new.
Just like the first day.

1432
01:40:09,001 --> 01:40:11,324
What do you think
you're going to do now?

1433
01:40:13,293 --> 01:40:15,616
I want to coax her out.

1434
01:40:15,959 --> 01:40:19,823
Yeah, I wouldn't push too hard
if I were you.

1435
01:40:20,168 --> 01:40:22,242
She's too fragile.

1436
01:40:22,584 --> 01:40:26,957
You'll see. When you least expect it,
things will fall into place naturally.

1437
01:40:27,293 --> 01:40:30,990
- (rain pours)
- (car alarm beeps)

1438
01:40:36,626 --> 01:40:40,667
- (fast footsteps approach)
- (Virgil grunts)

1439
01:40:42,126 --> 01:40:46,036
(Virgil) No!
(car alarm sounds)

1440
01:40:56,793 --> 01:40:58,333
(groans)

1441
01:40:59,876 --> 01:41:03,407
(thunder rumbles)

1442
01:41:16,543 --> 01:41:18,332
(thunder rumbles)

1443
01:41:28,209 --> 01:41:30,283
- (groans)
- (ring tone)

1444
01:41:34,334 --> 01:41:38,494
- (Claire) Hello? Hello?
- (Virgil mumbles indistinctly)

1445
01:41:38,668 --> 01:41:41,500
Virgil? Virgil, is that you?

1446
01:41:43,001 --> 01:41:45,075
(thunder rumbles)

1447
01:42:13,876 --> 01:42:16,543
Virgil! Virgil!

1448
01:42:22,709 --> 01:42:24,617
Virgil?

1449
01:42:45,251 --> 01:42:47,041
Help! Help!

1450
01:42:48,376 --> 01:42:50,911
- (nurse 1) Hold it up!
- (nurse 2) lt is up!

1451
01:42:51,293 --> 01:42:53,959
(nurses speak indistinctly)

1452
01:43:20,168 --> 01:43:22,917
(Claire) Why don't you love it?

1453
01:43:23,084 --> 01:43:26,913
I've never felt it to be a real home.
More like a hotel.

1454
01:43:27,251 --> 01:43:29,372
You come home a night,
sleep if you can.

1455
01:43:29,543 --> 01:43:31,913
Next morning,
you're off somewhere else.

1456
01:43:33,251 --> 01:43:35,325
Let's go back inside.

1457
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:40,490
Seems to have been planned
to welcome a lot of people.

1458
01:43:40,668 --> 01:43:44,033
Yes, but the plan was never realised.

1459
01:43:44,209 --> 01:43:46,876
Except for the inaugural reception.

1460
01:43:47,209 --> 01:43:49,165
I was so distrustful of other people

1461
01:43:49,334 --> 01:43:54,039
that I kept them away from
the perimeter of my personal hotel.

1462
01:43:56,334 --> 01:43:58,206
I was a fool.

1463
01:43:59,668 --> 01:44:01,244
Even now, I still get upset

1464
01:44:01,418 --> 01:44:04,700
when I see the housekeeper
and the maids walking about.

1465
01:44:04,876 --> 01:44:06,950
After dinner, I send them home.

1466
01:44:08,501 --> 01:44:11,036
I wasn't wrong when I said
we were very similar.

1467
01:44:11,209 --> 01:44:12,951
Yes, you were right.

1468
01:44:14,626 --> 01:44:16,700
And thanks to you, I understood.

1469
01:44:34,918 --> 01:44:37,536
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll soon find out.

1470
01:44:39,751 --> 01:44:43,661
Close your eyes.
I'll tell you when you can open them.

1471
01:44:47,084 --> 01:44:48,826
(electronic beep)

1472
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:55,000
Don't be afraid. I'll lead the way.

1473
01:44:55,168 --> 01:44:58,450
I never liked games
where you had to close your eyes.

1474
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:01,495
(keypad beeps)

1475
01:45:05,751 --> 01:45:09,282
- Mind the step.
- Gently, please.

1476
01:45:13,501 --> 01:45:14,745
We're almost there.

1477
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:17,785
Stop now.

1478
01:45:20,084 --> 01:45:21,791
Open your eyes.

1479
01:45:29,626 --> 01:45:31,332
I don't believe it.

1480
01:45:34,834 --> 01:45:36,327
It's overwhelming.

1481
01:45:36,959 --> 01:45:39,282
I've been collecting them
all my life.

1482
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:44,374
So, I'm not the first.
You have had other women

1483
01:45:44,709 --> 01:45:47,079
Yes.

1484
01:45:47,251 --> 01:45:49,822
I've loved them all
and they loved me back.

1485
01:45:50,168 --> 01:45:52,289
They taught me to wait for you.

1486
01:45:54,126 --> 01:45:55,951
And now that you're here,

1487
01:45:56,126 --> 01:45:58,330
we'd like you to come
and live with us

1488
01:45:58,501 --> 01:46:00,954
and make this beautiful hotel
your home.

1489
01:46:02,501 --> 01:46:04,042
Oh, Virgil.

1490
01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:09,198
If anything should ever happen to us,

1491
01:46:09,376 --> 01:46:11,450
I want you to know that I do love you.

1492
01:46:13,668 --> 01:46:15,291
I love you too.

1493
01:46:15,459 --> 01:46:19,121
The catalogue for the sale
of the paintings and furniture

1494
01:46:19,293 --> 01:46:20,785
of lbbetson Villa is ready.

1495
01:46:20,959 --> 01:46:24,407
Congratulations. It's a lovely volume.
(Robert) About time!

1496
01:46:26,084 --> 01:46:29,118
I wonder who'll buy
this wonderful stuff... Oh, sorry.

1497
01:46:29,293 --> 01:46:32,623
I can't conceal my anxiety to know
what you think about it.

1498
01:46:43,459 --> 01:46:45,000
Well, don't you like it?

1499
01:46:47,709 --> 01:46:49,083
No, it's just that...

1500
01:46:51,084 --> 01:46:53,869
...ever since I decided
to come and live with you...

1501
01:46:55,459 --> 01:46:59,156
...l've been thinking I... don't want
to sell anymore.

1502
01:47:01,543 --> 01:47:03,913
I'd like to leave everything
the way it was.

1503
01:47:10,751 --> 01:47:11,829
I understand.

1504
01:47:12,876 --> 01:47:13,906
Are you sure?

1505
01:47:14,751 --> 01:47:17,286
Believe me, if I were you,
I'd do the same thing.

1506
01:47:19,459 --> 01:47:22,825
Tomorrow, everything
will be back in its place.

1507
01:47:25,876 --> 01:47:27,038
Alright, Virgil!

1508
01:47:31,751 --> 01:47:35,910
To the most tortured and most
fortunate catalogue of my career.

1509
01:47:36,084 --> 01:47:37,743
That's saying something.

1510
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:39,955
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

1511
01:47:41,543 --> 01:47:43,948
And since you've become
my family...

1512
01:47:45,834 --> 01:47:48,536
...I too have an important
announcement to make.

1513
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:51,580
Next week,
I have an auction in London.

1514
01:47:51,918 --> 01:47:55,283
It will be the finest of my career
and the very last.

1515
01:47:58,209 --> 01:47:59,868
(indistinct chatter)

1516
01:48:01,001 --> 01:48:03,833
They say he's been seen
recently in female company.

1517
01:48:04,001 --> 01:48:05,743
- Who? Virgil?
- Yes.

1518
01:48:05,918 --> 01:48:10,042
It's finally come home to him that the
worst sexual perversion is chastity.

1519
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:13,870
(Claire) How is it going
onstage for the last time?

1520
01:48:14,043 --> 01:48:17,906
I've never felt better. There's
a whiff of anticipation in the air.

1521
01:48:18,084 --> 01:48:20,371
All my colleagues
have come to see me off.

1522
01:48:20,543 --> 01:48:21,917
That's nice of them.

1523
01:48:22,084 --> 01:48:25,913
This affection is because they won't
have to put up with me anymore.

1524
01:48:26,084 --> 01:48:28,075
(Claire laughs)

1525
01:48:28,251 --> 01:48:31,498
Anyhow, I'm happy, Claire.
I just wish you were here.

1526
01:48:31,668 --> 01:48:33,125
Me too.

1527
01:48:33,293 --> 01:48:36,741
But I'm not ready to travel yet.
I got dizzy in the car yesterday.

1528
01:48:36,918 --> 01:48:40,449
Don't let it get to you. We have
all the time in the world to travel.

1529
01:48:40,626 --> 01:48:42,782
- We're ready, Mr. Oldman.
- I'm coming.

1530
01:48:43,668 --> 01:48:45,872
Have you heard
from our young friends?

1531
01:48:46,043 --> 01:48:48,827
Constantly.
I'm never left on my own.

1532
01:48:49,001 --> 01:48:51,039
Good. Give them my love.

1533
01:48:52,209 --> 01:48:54,876
- I can hear you've got to go.
- Yes.

1534
01:48:55,959 --> 01:48:59,491
- But I can't wait to get back home.
- Good luck, my darling.

1535
01:49:00,459 --> 01:49:02,913
£12,100,000.

1536
01:49:06,084 --> 01:49:07,494
Any more?

1537
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:11,781
£12,300,000.

1538
01:49:13,084 --> 01:49:14,625
Any advance?

1539
01:49:17,626 --> 01:49:20,115
£12,500,000 on the telephone.

1540
01:49:21,626 --> 01:49:23,617
Any more?

1541
01:49:23,793 --> 01:49:26,411
All done at £12,500,000.

1542
01:49:26,751 --> 01:49:30,247
Sold for £12,500,000.

1543
01:49:31,584 --> 01:49:34,950
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.

1544
01:49:47,293 --> 01:49:50,623
- Good to see you.
- Thank you. Not a bad price.

1545
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:53,116
Can I say hello to you in public?

1546
01:49:53,293 --> 01:49:55,283
Oh, Billy.

1547
01:49:55,626 --> 01:49:59,750
You were fantastic, my friend! I'm
happy for you. I'm going to miss you.

1548
01:50:00,084 --> 01:50:02,289
You say it like
we'll never meet again.

1549
01:50:02,709 --> 01:50:04,202
Of course we will.

1550
01:50:04,376 --> 01:50:07,907
But I'm feeling nostalgic
thinking about all our exploits.

1551
01:50:08,626 --> 01:50:10,533
- You'll get over it.
- Virgil?

1552
01:50:11,668 --> 01:50:14,452
To remind you of
what a great artist I could've been

1553
01:50:14,793 --> 01:50:18,656
if only you'd believed in me,
I've sent you one of my paintings.

1554
01:50:18,834 --> 01:50:20,624
I promise I won't burn it.

1555
01:50:30,918 --> 01:50:32,458
Claire.

1556
01:50:34,001 --> 01:50:35,542
Claire, I'm back!

1557
01:50:37,543 --> 01:50:39,083
Hello?

1558
01:50:42,293 --> 01:50:45,160
- Have you seen Miss Claire?
- (housekeeper) No, sir.

1559
01:50:45,543 --> 01:50:47,083
Claire?

1560
01:50:48,709 --> 01:50:50,119
Where are you?

1561
01:50:51,876 --> 01:50:53,038
Claire?

1562
01:50:54,251 --> 01:50:57,035
(housekeeper) Mr. Oldman,
she must have gone out.

1563
01:50:57,376 --> 01:50:58,833
It was the same yesterday.

1564
01:50:59,001 --> 01:51:02,331
Sarah and Robert came to get her,
then came back for lunch.

1565
01:51:02,501 --> 01:51:03,745
Alright.

1566
01:51:24,418 --> 01:51:25,958
(electronic beep)

1567
01:52:23,501 --> 01:52:26,285
- (string snaps)
- (music starts to play)

1568
01:52:27,209 --> 01:52:29,117
(Robert's voice) "There is always

1569
01:52:29,293 --> 01:52:32,326
"something authentic
concealed in every forgery."

1570
01:52:32,501 --> 01:52:35,914
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1571
01:52:36,084 --> 01:52:38,289
"There is always something
authentic

1572
01:52:38,459 --> 01:52:40,249
"concealed in every forgery."

1573
01:52:40,418 --> 01:52:42,290
I couldn't agree more.

1574
01:52:42,459 --> 01:52:45,078
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1575
01:52:45,251 --> 01:52:47,455
"There is always something
authentic

1576
01:52:47,626 --> 01:52:49,368
"concealed in every forgery."

1577
01:52:49,543 --> 01:52:51,415
I couldn't agree more.

1578
01:52:51,584 --> 01:52:54,203
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1579
01:52:54,376 --> 01:52:56,497
"There is always something
authentic

1580
01:52:56,668 --> 01:52:58,374
"concealed in every forgery."

1581
01:52:58,709 --> 01:53:02,703
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1582
01:53:02,876 --> 01:53:05,032
"There is always something
authentic

1583
01:53:05,209 --> 01:53:06,916
"concealed in every forgery."

1584
01:53:07,084 --> 01:53:09,122
I couldn't agree more.

1585
01:53:09,293 --> 01:53:11,330
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1586
01:53:11,501 --> 01:53:14,949
"There is always something
authentic concealed in every..."

1587
01:53:31,459 --> 01:53:35,453
Good morning, Mr. Oldman.
We have visitors today.

1588
01:53:35,626 --> 01:53:38,743
Isn't this nice?
Look who's come to see you!

1589
01:53:46,293 --> 01:53:48,449
How are you, Mr. Oldman?

1590
01:53:53,084 --> 01:53:54,826
I've brought your mail,

1591
01:53:55,168 --> 01:53:58,450
some newspapers
and a few magazines.

1592
01:54:16,793 --> 01:54:18,830
(tyres screech)

1593
01:55:25,334 --> 01:55:29,198
A few days ago, they brought
some furniture to the villa opposite.

1594
01:55:32,751 --> 01:55:33,913
Did you notice?

1595
01:55:34,709 --> 01:55:37,577
I think so,
but I don't see much from in here.

1596
01:55:38,293 --> 01:55:39,323
Ask her.

1597
01:55:47,376 --> 01:55:48,785
Claire?

1598
01:55:48,959 --> 01:55:51,413
Listen to what
this gentleman wants to say.

1599
01:55:52,543 --> 01:55:53,573
(Claire) Yes.

1600
01:55:54,959 --> 01:55:56,369
And the day after,

1601
01:55:56,543 --> 01:55:59,790
other workmen came
and took everything away again.

1602
01:56:01,918 --> 01:56:03,458
The day after?

1603
01:56:04,751 --> 01:56:08,697
In 18 months,
three deliveries and three removals.

1604
01:56:11,668 --> 01:56:13,954
I was here a while ago.

1605
01:56:15,251 --> 01:56:17,455
- Do you remember?
- Nine.

1606
01:56:19,918 --> 01:56:23,864
- What do you mean?
- You've been here nine times.

1607
01:56:25,918 --> 01:56:27,375
Today makes 10.

1608
01:56:27,709 --> 01:56:31,324
I was wondering if you saw
a woman leave the villa.

1609
01:56:32,584 --> 01:56:35,784
Medium height, light hair,
a bit pale?

1610
01:56:37,084 --> 01:56:40,948
- Yes.
- That time was 231.

1611
01:56:42,543 --> 01:56:44,000
Are you sure?

1612
01:56:44,334 --> 01:56:45,993
Then another six.

1613
01:56:46,834 --> 01:56:51,788
In a year and a half,
I saw her go out 237 times.

1614
01:56:52,168 --> 01:56:53,577
(barman) What did I say?

1615
01:56:53,751 --> 01:56:56,204
She's a phenomenon,
remembers everything.

1616
01:56:58,251 --> 01:56:59,792
It's not possible.

1617
01:57:02,334 --> 01:57:04,455
You were at the villa 63 times.

1618
01:57:04,793 --> 01:57:08,703
36 during the day and 27 at night,

1619
01:57:09,043 --> 01:57:11,366
excluding the night
of the accident.

1620
01:57:12,834 --> 01:57:16,247
- One, four, four.
- One, four, four?

1621
01:57:16,584 --> 01:57:18,824
The telephone number
for the ambulance.

1622
01:57:20,293 --> 01:57:21,869
The villa is free now.

1623
01:57:22,251 --> 01:57:25,166
If you're interested,
I'll get you a good deal.

1624
01:57:26,793 --> 01:57:29,411
- Who owns it?
- Me.

1625
01:57:30,626 --> 01:57:32,700
But I don't know what to do with it.

1626
01:57:33,793 --> 01:57:36,459
I often rent it out to cinema people.

1627
01:57:37,376 --> 01:57:38,750
Cinema people?

1628
01:57:39,334 --> 01:57:42,285
For the past two years,
it's been taken by the engineer

1629
01:57:42,459 --> 01:57:44,995
who does the lift
that takes me up to my house.

1630
01:57:45,793 --> 01:57:47,499
He's really nice, that boy.

1631
01:57:48,418 --> 01:57:50,076
He can do anything.

1632
01:57:50,251 --> 01:57:52,740
There's nothing he can't fix.

1633
01:57:53,334 --> 01:57:56,665
And he's always kissing me.
(giggles)

1634
01:57:56,834 --> 01:57:58,624
Bringing me flowers.

1635
01:57:59,876 --> 01:58:02,116
(ethereal instrumental music)

1636
01:58:47,834 --> 01:58:49,908
(ringing tone)

1637
01:59:06,959 --> 01:59:08,500
(music intensifies)

1638
02:00:29,584 --> 02:00:31,658
(Claire moans)

1639
02:00:43,959 --> 02:00:47,740
(loudspeaker) The Paris Express
is now arriving at platform seven.

1640
02:00:49,209 --> 02:00:50,916
Your attention, please.

1641
02:00:51,084 --> 02:00:53,917
The Berlin-Prague Arrow
is running 40 minutes late

1642
02:00:54,084 --> 02:00:55,281
due to fog on the line.

1643
02:00:57,126 --> 02:00:58,667
Come in, sir.

1644
02:01:00,001 --> 02:01:02,371
We furnished it
exactly as you requested.

1645
02:01:03,793 --> 02:01:06,281
And tomorrow, your trunks
will be delivered.

1646
02:01:06,459 --> 02:01:09,576
And later, I'll pass by
with a copy of your contract.

1647
02:01:09,918 --> 02:01:13,283
If there's anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

1648
02:01:19,751 --> 02:01:21,292
Oh, Virgil.

1649
02:01:22,709 --> 02:01:26,917
If anything should happen to us,
I want you to know that I do love you.

1650
02:01:27,251 --> 02:01:29,704
(ethereal instrumental music)

1651
02:02:38,793 --> 02:02:41,707
- (indistinct chatter)
- (bell rings)

1652
02:02:46,793 --> 02:02:48,416
(bell rings)

1653
02:02:54,168 --> 02:02:56,242
(clocks ticking)

1654
02:02:57,543 --> 02:02:59,617
(indistinct chatter)

1655
02:03:06,168 --> 02:03:08,242
(loud ticking)

1656
02:03:10,959 --> 02:03:14,455
(indistinct speaking)

1657
02:03:50,709 --> 02:03:52,783
(waiter) Are you on your own, sir?

1658
02:04:03,418 --> 02:04:06,120
No. I'm waiting for someone.

1659
02:04:14,251 --> 02:04:16,325
(instrumental music)

1660
02:04:30,584 --> 02:04:32,658
(indistinct speaking)

1661
02:04:51,626 --> 02:04:53,700
(clocks ticking)
