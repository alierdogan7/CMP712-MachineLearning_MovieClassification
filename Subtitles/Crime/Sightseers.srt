00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,451
(continues wailing)

00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,341
(quietly) Mum? Mum?

4
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,473
Mum?

5
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,225
Mum?

6
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,145
Mum?

7
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,362
Mum?

8
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,982
Mum? Mum?

9
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,740
Mum?

10
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,200
You all right?

11
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,380
I was just thinking about Poppy.

12
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,672
She was me only friend.

13
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,426
Aw, Mum. I'm your friend.

14
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,599
You're not a friend.
You're just a relative.

15
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,106
I'm 34 years old!

16
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,731
And I've found someone who likes me,
and I like him,

17
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,611
and I'm going on holiday with him.

18
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,940
You're running away

19
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,076
from your... guilt!

20
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,114
Don't do that with Poppy's lead, Mum.

21
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,638
<i>(Carol)
You've always had lovely hair, Tina.</i>

22
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,136
<i>(Tina) It is quite thick, isn't it?</i>

23
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,637
<i>(Carol) Yes.</i>

24
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:41,473
<i>I've always admired your hair
being thick, because mine's so thin.</i>

25
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:48,651
<i>I think you might have a few split ends.
Better watch that.</i>

26
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,822
- Any more bags you want taking?
- (Tina) Well,

27
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,821
- I might want a couple more towels.
- (Chris) No, not in there.

28
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,615
(Chris) You didn't tell me
your mum was an artist.

29
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,829
<i>(Tina) What?</i>

30
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,664
Look at these.

31
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,462
(whispers) Chris, don't go in there.

32
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,589
- (mumbles) Why not?
- Come out. Chris.

33
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,337
What's going on?

34
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,919
(Chris) I'm just admiring
your artwork, Carol. It's fantastic.

35
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,130
I don't want anyone in my room.

36
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,930
Chris was just saying how talented
he thinks you are, Mum.

37
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,226
(Carol) It's my private sanctum.
I don't want anybody looking.

38
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,850
Well, no one's looking
in your sanctum, Mum.

39
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,057
So I'll just... Shall I leave you, then,
to look at your brushes?

40
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,734
I'll just sit for a few minutes, yes.

41
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,187
- Okay.
- I could do with a cup of tea.

42
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,443
- I'll get you one, Mum.
- That'd be nice.

43
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,196
- I'm shutting the door now.
- That's okay.

44
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,697
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,779
Okay, Mum, bye.

46
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,284
Bye.

47
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,574
- All right?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,079
Good.

49
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,754
(both chuckling)

50
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,298
- I've always wanted a boy in my bed.
- Come on.

51
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,000
<i>- Have you?
- Yeah. I was never allowed.</i>

52
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,677
I've always wanted to be in this bed.

53
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,972
- This is Jonty.
- Oh, he's putting me off.

54
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,595
(Tina laughing)

55
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,100
- (Chris) I like this room.
- Do you?

56
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,935
- Mmm.
- I hate it.

57
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,358
Why?

58
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,653
<i>(Tina) Well, I like the bits.</i>

59
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,363
(Chris) Makes me think of you
when you were a kid.

60
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,072
<i>(Tina) At the same time, if it was
all destroyed, I'd be quite happy.</i>

61
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,122
(Chris) So what were you like
when you were a little kid, then?

62
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,872
<i>(Tina) Unhappy.
(Chris) You didn't like school?</i>

63
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,828
- (Tina exhales)
- I know, nor me.

64
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,789
What were you like at school, Chris?

65
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,716
I wasn't like anything.
I was, like, invisible.

66
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,419
<i>(Tina) What about you being ginger?</i>

67
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,596
<i>(Chris) Well, that's a problem, yeah.</i>

68
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,469
<i>(Tina) That's not invisible, is it?</i>

69
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,846
<i>(Chris) No, but I wanted to be.</i>

70
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,892
Oh, I don't think it's safe
going off with him.

71
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,814
It is safe!

72
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,770
I know about all kinds of people who've
had very bad experiences in caravans.

73
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,275
Like who?

74
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,652
Well, Louise.

75
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,825
<i>She fell out of it, didn't she?</i>

76
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,530
<i>Oh, I don't know. I mean, you've gone
far too fast with him far too soon.</i>

77
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,330
<i>You hardly know him.</i>

78
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,499
<i>(Tina) You look like you...
you don't trust him.</i>

79
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,080
<i>(Carol) I don't.</i>

80
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,709
<i>(Tina) Just let him get on with it.</i>

81
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
(Carol) Well, I'd like to know
what he's getting on with.

82
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,507
- Well, he's packing.
- How much of our stuff has he got?

83
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,676
Mum, he hasn't got any of your stuff.
Don't be silly.

84
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,936
<i>(Chris) All right, uh, toothbrush?
(Tina) Yeah.</i>

85
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,562
<i>- And a sponge?
- Yeah.</i>

86
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,735
- Umbrella?
- Yes.

87
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,402
- Uh, wash bag?
- Yes.

88
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,862
- What's that? What's that?
- Potpourri.

89
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,160
And what are you bringing that for?
We don't need potpourri.

90
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,660
I don't think I could cope
without potpourri, Chris.

91
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,117
You're gonna have a woman's touch
on this holiday, Chris.

92
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,746
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping.

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,328
(chuckles) Oh, Chris.
Don't look at my bum.

94
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,505
<i>- I'm not looking at your bum.
- You are.</i>

95
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,503
<i>- Just son' of loomed into my vision.
- (Tina laughing)</i>

96
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,380
(clattering)

97
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,506
Milady.

98
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,935
- Bye, Mum.
- You'll be back.

99
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,933
I will, Mum, in a week.

100
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,308
Okay, well, we'll see you then, Carol.

101
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,189
I'll bring her back safe,
don't you worry.

102
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,317
Hey, I understand
you collect snow globes.

103
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,899
I don't like you.

104
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,778
Okay, well, see you, then.

105
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,492
(engine starts)

106
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,161
Show me your world, Chris.

107
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,334
Well, I thought we'd start
with Crich Tram Museum.

108
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,878
- Great.
- Murderer.

109
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,082
It was an accident, Mum.

110
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,586
So were you.

111
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,501
(Chris) Don't listen to her.

Ah, sharpens the mind.

00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,507
Poppy loved mints.

131
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,345

So, ladies and gentlemen,
this is, um,

135
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,799
one of about 1,200 tram cars
of this type, of type E1,

136
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,633
built, um, by London County Council

137
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,594
from about 1912 onwards.

138
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,931
Out of those 1,200 trams,
only two have survived.

139
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:03,020
(Chris) You know, mobility,
the key to personal opportunity.

140
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,528
It's why I favour the Abbey Oxford
as a caravan.

141
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,904
So I'm the captain of me own fate.

142
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,536
Excuse me, you dropped your wrapper.

143
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,205
Your wrapper.

144
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,380
I said, you dropped your wrapper.

145
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,051
You see that? Do you see that?

146
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,416
(Chris sighs) You just
don't expect to see that, do you?

147
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,415
No. He was a pig, Chris.

148
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,124
He was a pig in clothes.
I don't want this to ruin our holiday.

149
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,750
You expect that of a kid
who doesn't know any better.

150
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,255
- (shushing)
- But that's a bloody grown man.

151
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,961
He must be, what, 35,
something like that?

152
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,589
- Yeah, you don't expect it.
- Behaving like that in front of...

153
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,345
- He's setting an example to kids...
- I know, it's terrible.

154
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,768
And we're in a place where there's...
It's a bloody heritage place.

155
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,265
- I know. Shh. I know.
- I just cannot...

156
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,766
Maybe you'll feel better
if you have a scone.

157
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,181
- No. No.
- Do you want a scone?

158
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,108
No! They've not been preserved
for hundreds of years

159
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,940
- so that wankers like that...
- Shh. Shh.

160
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,103

Yeah.

166
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,330
Wait here, won't you?

167
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,196
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy
the museum if you're in this state.

168
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,031
I'll have to come home, then.

169
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,411
Chris is up there, he's looking at me.
I don't...

170
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,989
Well, no! I'm gonna have...

171
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,042
Well, I'm gonna have to come back, Mum,
'cause I can't leave you in this state.

172
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,009
- Hey, what's up? Oh, come on, what's up?
-(sobbing)

173
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,092
Hey. What's happened?

174
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,223
- What'd she say?
-(sobbing) We have to go home.

175
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,767
Why? What, because of her?

176
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,400
Blue John mines tomorrow. Pencil Museum.

177
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,190
I know how much you wanted to see that.

178
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,903
Got some vouchers as well.
Two-for-one restaurant deal.

179
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,786
They expire in a week.
It's now or never.

180
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,453
(engine revving)

181
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,744
(crunching)

182
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,074
(inaudible)

183
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,914
(inaudible)

184
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,269
He just stepped out, Chris,
and it wasn't your fault.

185
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,437
(Chris sighs deeply)

186
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,280
Maybe you're right.

187
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:20,948
(voice trembling) I just feel so
devastated for his family, you know?

188
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,623
- Maybe your mother was right.
- About what?

189
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,333
About everything!

190
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,085
About everything.

191
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,749
- Chris...
- He's ruined the Tram Museum for me now.

192
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,144
Mint me.

193
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,772
What?

194
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,480
You heard me. Mint me.

195
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,340
(both moaning)

196
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,217
(moaning continues)

197
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:29,183
(moaning continues)

198
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,477
<i>"Dear Mum, I'm not coming home.</i>

199
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,397
<i>"Yorkshire is lovely.
Not like you said at all.</i>

200
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,151
<i>"They can smile,
and they do sell my pasta sauce.</i>

201
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,870
<i>The caravan bed is quite short,
but Chris is a sensitive lover.</i>

202
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,328
<i>"Hope you can be happy for me.
Love, Tina."</i>

203
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,847
<i>(Tina) Right, well,
they've only got two spots left.</i>

204
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,385
One by the Dingley Dell
and one by the bogs.

205
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,554
(Chris) Um, he's going for Dingley Dell.

206
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,352
Chris, I want Dingley Dell.

207
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,016
I'm gonna get this bloody Dingley Dell.

208
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,944
- Can't we go around it?
- Just hold on, I'm gonna do it.

209
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,733
- Go around them. Go around.
- We'll make it.

210
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,856
- Go that way.
- I will, just wait there, wait...

211
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,026
- Just go around it.
- Okay! Hold on.

212
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,569
Oh, Chris! Don't look at them, Chris.

213
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,700
- (gasps) Oh, I just...
-(whooping)

214
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,575
(tyres skidding)

215
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,080
(both laugh)

216
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,582
Fuck you!

217
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,499
I am the best. Get in.

218
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,340
<i>- Now, see that'?
-Y es.</i>

219
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,593
Plug that into that
little hole over there. Right?

220
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,425
Why?

221
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,724
You don't need to know why. Just do it.

222
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,931
- Okay?
- The little hole.

223
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,769
The little hole.

224
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,574
Turn it round so that fits
in that little bit there.

225
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,196
- That hole...
- No, I wanna do it.

226
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,279
- Okay.
- This is a ridiculous plug, this.

227
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,282
Never seen anything like it.

228
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,122
-(clicks)
-(Chris) There we go.

229
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,704
- I did it. (chuckles)
- Brilliant.

230
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,422
I'll just sort that out.

231
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,763
Chris?

232
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,633
What?

233
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,555
It's a bit eerie, isn't it?

234
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,553
Yeah, I suppose it is, yeah.

235
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,439
I didn't think it would kill him,
did you, Chris?

236
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,895
Well, there's loads of stuff
under a caravan that'll kill you.

237
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,894
I'll have nightmares
about that tonight now.

238
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,982
Oh, you're not gonna go under a caravan,
are you?

239
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,655
You're gonna be in the driving seat.

240
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,736
In the car, with me.

241
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,782
Well, not driving.
I mean, in the passenger seat.

242
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,746
I'll do the driving.

243
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,087
(Chris) Bit of a mess, actually.

244
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,007
There we go, good as new.

245
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,261
(Chris) This is exactly
how I imagined it.

246
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,769
There's no one sticking their nose in.

247
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,346
No one penetrating the mind.

248
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,142
<i>(sighing) I'll have to sort
all of this out all again.</i>

249
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,312
(Chris) Take the noble English oak,
Old Knobbley.

250
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,940
That won't stab you in the back
or belittle your five-year plan.

251
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,867
I mean, where am I supposed to put that?

252
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,531
- That tree won't...
- There isn't anywhere.

253
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,495
- There's just no surfaces.
-...steal things that belong to you

254
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,203
and put them in another place
just to piss you off.

255
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,661
That tree won't involve itself
in low-level bullying

256
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,293
that means you have to leave work.

257
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,717
I've got a confession to make.

258
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,337
Chris. Not a wheat intolerance?

259
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,679
No. It's, uh, it's not just
an erotic odyssey we're on.

260
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,685
(disappointed) Isn't it?

261
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,222
Well, it is.
I mean, that's a big part of it, but...

262
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,390
(inhales) Er, I'm writing a book.

263
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,983
- Are you?
- Yeah.

264
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,357
I thought I'd just have
a bit of a sabbatical.

265
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,069
You know, a bit of time off work
and, you know, find my voice.

266
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,492
But, uh, I've had a bit of a problem
with writer's block.

267
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,366
You know, been...
creative constipation.

268
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,076
I hooked up with you at capoeira

269
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,076
and I realised you were exactly
what I needed. You know, a muse.

270
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,043
- Am I your muse?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,247
- Chris!
- How do you feel about that?

272
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,919
I've never been a muse before.

273
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,637
No? I've never had a muse before.
It's great. Yeah.

274
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,679
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

275
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,928
- What's the book about?
-(drums playing faintly)

276
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:40,514
<i>Just sort of making inroads into
my own mind and taking notes as I go.</i>

277
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,223
Do you know what I mean? It's fantastic.

278
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,150
I'm really pleased with
what I've come up with so far.

279
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,445
<i>-(Man) Knock, knock.
-(Chris) Oh, hello.</i>

280
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,942
Settled in?

281
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,524
(Chris) Yeah, we have, thanks.
Yeah, lovely spot.

282
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,029
- Not bad, is it?
- Yeah.

283
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,283
Just doing my rounds.
Sorry about the racket.

284
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,205
-(Chris) Yeah.
- Festival in the yurt field.

285
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,204
-(Chris) Who are they?
- Uh, well, they're shaman.

286
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,753
They're sort of priests. Shamans.
They're from Portsmouth, you know.

287
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,706
- Uh-huh.
-It's just a little festival.

288
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,382
Keeps them all happy, doesn't it?
You know.

289
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,175
And how long are they
gonna be drumming for?

290
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,219
Well, just this evening.

291
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,047
- Okay?
- Thanks a lot, mate.

292
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,348
- All the best.
- Yeah.

293
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,142
- Bye.
- Pleasure.

294
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,142
He seemed nice.

295
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,020
(disdainfully) Yurts.

296
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,665
(Chris) There's a stream
down here somewhere.

297
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,497
I need some proper boots, Chris.

298
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,332
(Chris) Yeah,
brought my last girlfriend.

299
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,837
Oh.

300
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,056
Yeah, I think this was it.

301
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,218
This is a ditch, Chris.

302
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,231
<i>(woman) I thought he said on the phone
we'd be at the Dingley Dell.</i>

303
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,658
-(man) I know, darling.
- We're right by the loo.

304
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,407
- Well, that'll be handy.
-shall I take some light stuff, darling?

305
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,365
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Sterling Elite 90, isn't it?

306
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,869
Sorry?

307
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,622
Sterling Elite 90.

308
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,166
Yeah. Yes.

309
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,626
How'd you find it
on the petrol consumption?

310
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,215
Uh, not too bad, actually.

311
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,968
Takes her less fuel to pull
than some of the older models.

312
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:42,302
Yeah, you're probably right, yeah.
We use loads of petrol. Don't we, Tina?

313
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,307
Yeah, we love it.

314
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:49,267
Hey, do you mind if we have
a little look inside? Is that all right?

315
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,772
<i>(both) Um___</i>

316
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,070
<i>- I'll only be a second.
-(man) A quick look wouldn't hurt.</i>

317
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,147
<i>(Chris) Yeah.
(woman) Okay. Fine.</i>

318
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,529
(Chris) We really appreciate it.
Be fantastic to have a look in there.

319
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,485
Sorry, do you mind
just slipping those off?

320
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,821
- I saw you come out of the toilet block.
-(Chris) Mmm-hmm.

321
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,827
(Tina gasps)

322
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,627
It's beautiful in here.
It's just like a hospital.

323
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,375
-It's all oak.
-(dog barking)

324
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,627
(Chris) What's this, then?

325
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,128
<i>(man) It's a stereo unit.
It's a bit delicate.</i>

326
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,836
<i>(Chris) Is it?
(woman) It's German. German.</i>

327
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,338
There's no buttons on it.

328
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,265
(chuckles) Well, it's voice-activated.
Don't... Sorry...

329
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,015
- POPPY
-(woman) You all right, Banjo?

330
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,516
Are you in there?

331
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,975
(indistinct chattering on TV)

332
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,866
<i>-(Carol) Tina?
- What?</i>

333
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,490
Have you had all the Senokot?

334
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,952
- No.
-(doorbell rings)

335
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,502
- Hello.
- Hi. My name's Chalid Sulinan.

336
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,505
I work for CACSA,
raising money for child soldiers.

- Aren't you naughty?

339
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,638
Okay. (clears throat) I have got some...

340
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,060
POPPY. Come on!

341
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,937
(barking playfully)

342
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,358
She's... She's like that.
Come on! Yeah!

343
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,103
You're distracting me now, Poppy.
Go on.

344

Sorry, do you mind not opening that one?</i>

349
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,624
God... No!

350
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,882
We don't give him junk food!

351
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,668

00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,559
- Cheap crisps are full of horrors.
-(woman) I know.

354
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,855
It'll be nice when you've
decorated it a bit, this place.

355
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,183
Oh, well, we don't like clutter.

356
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,938
No, no, no, you don't want clutter.

357
00:23:55,017 --> 00:24:00,820
You just want some plants and cushions
and pictures and a tablecloth there.

358
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:04,823
Yeah, well, that would be clutter,
though, wouldn't it? (sighs)

359
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,252
I'm really sorry about that.

360
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,171
(chuckling nervously) Sorry, sorry.
That's really embarrassing.

361
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,920
- Never mind.
- Sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

362
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,385
It's fine.

363
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,843
Uh, you'll have to pop over
to Dingley Dell sometime.

364
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,851
But, uh, if the caravan's rockin',
don't come a-knockin'.

365
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,231
Ha. Um, we're pretty intent
on doing some serious walking.

369
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,528
(disinterestedly) Yeah. Are you?

370
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,836

371
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,545

374
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,804
I didn't like their caravan.

Oh, sorry, yeah.
No, I'll get cleaned up in a minute.

00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,351
You getting any inspiration?

446
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,859
- Chris.
- Hang on.

447
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,657
- Chris. Chris.
- Shut up, will you?

448
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,284
- Taste that.
-(shushing)

449
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,111

- Fuck!
- What?

452
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,664
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- What is it?

453
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,374
Every time I think I've found my oeuvre,
someone shits on it.

454
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,209
Well, I wouldn't shit on you, Chris.

455
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,635
Not unless you asked me to.

456
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,384
Everyone else seems to find it
so easy to express themselves.

457
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,381
I mean, even you've got your knitting,
haven't you?

458
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,969
But the thing is, Chris,
I'm your muse now.

459
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,974
And we've got Banjo.

460
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,398
So everything will be perfect.
You just need to be a bit more patient.

461
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,987
- There's something in me, Tina.
- I'll help you squeeze it out.

(Tina) Anything?</i>

464
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,906
How much is that?

465
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,040
-60 quid.
- No, you can't have that.

466
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,746
I need walking boots, don't I?

467
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,248
Well, we'll get
the walking boots as well.

468
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,581
<i>(woman) You want a good tread.</i>

469
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,086
Okay-

470
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,883
- You heard about the man, didn't you?
- No.

471
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,345
He slipped on the crag
and went off the cliff yesterday.

472
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,393
- Did you not hear about that?
- No! Did he hurt himself?

473
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,929
Head smashed like a pumpkin.

474
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,853
That's why I'd never have
stone flooring.

475
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,106
Although I do love
that French farmhouse look.

476
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,607
Yeah, it's terrible, isn't it,

477
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,780
when people don't have respect
for the power of nature?

478
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,448
Can't find his dog.

479
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,744
Well, it probably committed suicide.
Dogs will do that.

480
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,452
Tina, why don't you try these?
Look. Give them a go.

481
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,539
-(chuckles) Oh, Chris.
- Eh? Why not?

482
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,234
(birds squawking)

483
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,169
<i>(Tina) I've got some sad news.
It's about your father.</i>

484
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,670
He's dead.

485
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,641
(whimpering softly)

486
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,437
Hey. Don't dwell on it.

487
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,988
- How'd it go?
- I had a word.

488
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,986
How'd he take it?

489
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,988
Well, he's all right.
He's a bit shaken but...

490
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,570
- Is he?
- Come on. Come on.

491
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,704
This was a 13th-century ruin
founded by monks. (chuckles)

492
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:22,580
Yeah, maybe I should do
an abbot detective story or something.

493
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,423
What do you think
happened to Ian, Chris?

494
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,210
- Chris?
- Huh?

495
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,840
Chris.

496
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,551
- What do you think happened to Ian?
- What?

497
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,267
(camera clicking)

498
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,849
Do you think Banjo
had something to do with it?

499
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,768
Well, yeah, he's probably capable.
He's an animal, isn't he?

500
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,980
Do you think he might have pushed him?
'Cause he was an abused dog.

501
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,026
There might be, uh, blood
on the paws of that dog,

502
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,329
but it's smug complacency
that killed Ian, I tell you that.

503
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,038
Janice looked frigid as well,
didn't she?

504
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,332
(stone grinding)

505
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,632
Chris, look, it's coming out.

506
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,213
(bell tolling)

507
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,517
(Chris) I'm a monk.

508
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,186
<i>(man) Well, who's this little chap?
Let's have a look.</i>

509
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,686
Oh, POPPY-

510
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,736
- Oh, you're sweet, aren't you?
-(chuckles)

511
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,404
This is Barney.
Barney, come and say hello.

512
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,106
<i>(Tina) Barney.
(woman) Come and say hello.</i>

513
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,736
<i>(Tina) Say hello to Barney.</i>

514
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:36,946
- Aw! They love each other. Don't they?
-(woman) Well, they're a bit shy.

515
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,703
Yeah, well, often it's like that
when it's love at first sight.

516
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,375
-Isn't it, Chris?
- What?

517
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,044
-It's like you and me when we met.
-(man) They're not fighting, anyway.

518
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,669
-(Tina) Speechless. Yeah, speechless.
- Speechless, yeah.

519
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,426
Look at that graffiti there.
"Rob loves Kerry."

520
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,062
My husband's researching for his book.

521
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,560
Oh, really?

522
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,983
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I am, yeah.

523
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,685
Actually, it's his third.

524
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,896
You've certainly picked
an interesting spot.

525
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,652
<i>(woman) Are you staying nearby?</i>

526
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,153
Well, actually we're mobile.

527
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,902
(Tina grunting)

528
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,655
(moaning)

529
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,625
Oh, God, Chris,
this is just how I imagined it.

530
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,420
(beeping)

531
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,002
-(whimpering)
-(mattress banging)

532
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,758
(beeping)

533
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,260
-(ringing)
-(Tina grunting)

534
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,591
(beeps Off)

535
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,052
(grunting)

536
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,400
(both moaning)

537
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,022
(both grunting)

538
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,958
(Chris) For Christ's sake!

539
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,336
- Get off!
- What did I do?

540
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,084
Not you. Bloody Banjo.

541
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,631
Poppy!

542
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,629
He's a fuckin' pervert.

543
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:22,509
Get in there. Get in there.
Go on, Banjo. Get in the bloody car.

544
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,256
Chris?

545
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,343
Come on.

546
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,514
(Tina whooping)

547
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,896
-(whooping)
-(Chris chuckling)

548
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,857
- I can fly!
- Whoa!

549
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,272
I can fly, Chris.

550
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,650
- Whoo!
-Vvhooamhool

551
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:23,445
Chris? Which button do I press?

552
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,615
Oh, it's okay, I've done it.

553
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,288
Yeah, Poppy!

554
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,082
Chris, there's quite
a nice one of you here.

555
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,087
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

556
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,802
Whoo! (chuckles)

557
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,006
Chris, these are a bit saucy,
these ones.

558
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,987
This is not my vagina!

559
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,111
This is not my vagina!

560
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,238
I don't know what you mean.

561
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,537
Janice doesn't look
very frigid to me, Chris!

562
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,492
In fact,
she looks like a very happy girl.

563
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,621
No, that's...

564
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,671
No wonder, when you look at Ian.

565
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,920
That's not Ian. That's me, that.

566
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,502
Were you shagging Janice?

567
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,551
-(chuckles) What are you talking about?
- Were you shagging Ian?

568
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,883
- Don't be stupid.
- Were you shagging both of them?

569
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,967
- Ah, come on.
- Are you gay?

570
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,430
- What? You know I'm not gay.
- Why are they at a wedding?

571
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,559
What wedding?

572
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,018
(sobs) Did you go to a wedding
with Ian and Janice, Chris?

573
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,977
- I didn't.
- Was... (sobbing)

574
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,072
(sobbing stops)

575
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,158
What's going on here?

576
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,906
I wouldn't look. Don't.

577
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,614
Did you kill Ian?

578
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,460
Yeah. Well, I mean...

579
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,713
Why'd you do that?

580
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,133
I didn't mean to.
It was just an accident.

581
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,220
And that just happened.

582
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,389
Can't do things like that.

583
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,222
It's gonna ruin the holiday.

584
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,637
I just did... I did that for you.

585
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,075
<i>(female newsreader on TV)
The council had fought an injunction</i>

586
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,248
<i>to remove Mr Andrews
and begun proceedings to evict him.</i>

587
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,283
<i>The house has been condemned,
as it was erected</i>

588
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,912
<i>without proper planning permission.</i>

589
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,505
<i>Police now think that Ian Worthing,</i>

590
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,424
<i>whose body was found at the base
of a Yorkshire crag yesterday,</i>

591
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,596
<i>could have killed himself
because of mounting financial pressures.</i>

592
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,683
- Oh! Buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

593
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,931
- No wife?
- No, no, she's, uh...

594
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,763
she's back at the, uh, caravan tonight.

595
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,272
- Oh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

596
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,774
- Yeah, so's Joan.
- Is she? Yeah, yeah.

597
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,478
We both said what a nice couple
we thought you were.

598
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,276
Oh, did you? Oh, that's very nice.
Cheers, yeah.

599
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,983
Yeah, no, I love her. Yeah.

600
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,361
<i>Yeah, we're in love.</i>

601
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,372
Yeah, I love her.

602
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:32,218
<i>Hi, Chris, it's me. It's... It's Tina.
I'm just, um...</i>

603
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,137
I'm just having fun in the caravan.

604
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,641
<i>Um...</i>

605
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,058
<i>I'm just wondering where you are.</i>

606
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,821
<i>It's very cosy,
and We made some dinner.</i>

607
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,692
<i>Come back?</i>

608
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,009
Ooh, steady. Are you okay?

609
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,511
Yeah.

610
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,513
Got a bit carried away. (chuckles)

611
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:19,272
<i>- I'll get the car in the morning.
- Come on. There you go.</i>

612
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,901
- Thanks for bringing him back, Richard.
- Oh, pleasure.

613
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,769
- You take it easy.
- You're a legend, mate.

614
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,695
(chuckles) Good luck with the ley lines.

615
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,527
Yeah. See you, mate.

616
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,238
(car driving away)

617
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,364
Oh, I think I've got a Iey line
running through me head. (chuckles)

618
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,704
(voice breaking) I thought you'd gone.

619
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,194
Chris, Poppy's stopping.

620
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,069
Poppy's stopping, Chris.

621
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,196
Yeah, good girl.

622
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,115
Aw! You having a little poo? Well done.

623
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,710
Excuse me.
You are going to pick that up?

624
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,370
Well, I haven't, I've... Chris?

625
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,757
This is a site of natural beauty
and geographical interest.

626
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,252
I think you need to sort that out.

627
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,888
- I didn't do that.
- Uh, you need to pick it up.

628
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,137
- I can't... Well, I can't.
- Why? Why can't you?

629
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,473
Well, I haven't got the proper things
to do it with.

630
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,222
Why didn't you bring the proper things
with you if you're out with your dog?

631
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,981
Well, I did bring the proper things...

632
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,100
(sobs)
...but I'm not having a very good day.

633
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,610
-(Chris) Good morning.
- Chris.

634
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,613
- Good morning.
- He's told me I've got to pick that up

635
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,944
-with my fingers.
-well, a dog does a shit.

636
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,817
You know, you can't do much
about that, mate.

637
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,660
You can pick it up
and you take it away with you.

638
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,280
Well, I would have the bags,
but they're in the bloody car

639
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:02,326
that you've left, drunk,
outside some pub that we can't...

640
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,669
- We don't even know where the pub is.
- Tina, I know where the car is.

641
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,332
- No, you don't.
- I do. I know where it is.

642
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,627
- We are lost, Chris! Lost!
- I know where it is.

643
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,466
- I know... Look, Tina.
- You don't.

644
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,843
Look, I'm sorry, but if you don't
pick up this excrement immediately,

645
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,633
then I'm gonna have to inform
the National Trust.

646
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,093
Actually, do you know what?
I don't think you are sorry, mate.

647
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,804
I don't think you're sorry, either.

648
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,468
- Did he touch you?
- What?

649
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,805
- Don't know. Wasn't concentrating.
- Have a think.

650
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,693
Can you remember everything?

651
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,274
Uh, yes. Yes, he did touch me.

652
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,486
- Oh... (stammers) This is preposterous!
- What else did he do?

653
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,119
-(softly) He, urn...
- Details.

654
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:42,783
(whispering) ...tried to put
Poppy's balls in his mouth.

655
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,494
- Did you go to a private school?
- That is totally irrelevant, but yes.

656
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,879
Yeah, I thought so. It's the tone.
It's the entitlement you got...

657
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,373
I'm entitled to walk
in the countryside...

658
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,045
- Yeah, you're superior.
-...without having to encounter

659
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,668
-dog excrement.
- You're not entitled

660
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,882
-to be a bloody bully, mate...
- Put your stick down, for starters.

661
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,676
-...bullying my girlfriend.
- Leave the turd where it is.

662
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,181
I will point this stick at you!

663
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,683
They still think
it's their country, don't they?

664
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,684
<i>(man) It should be for people
that at least respect the countryside.</i>

665
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,220
See how far his A level
in Classics gets him

666
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:05,892
-when China owns the whole of the UK.

Report that to the National Trust, mate.

679
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,943
You know, 300 years ago

680
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,735
his ancestor would have strode
down a path just like this, you know,

681
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,530
and he'd have seen some common strumpet
like you and he'd have gone,

682
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,069
"I'm gonna have a bit of that."

683
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:04,030
And I'd have had to have stood by
and watched him.

684
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,746
'Cause I'd have been a serf and he'd
have been the bloody lord of the manor.

685
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,086
And they call them "the good old days".

<i>(Tina) I suppose.</i>

687
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,709
If you look at it that way,
you were defending my honour.

688
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,509
Oh, don't thank me,
thank the democratic process.

689
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,888
Never thought about murdering
innocent people like that before.

690

he's a Daily Mail reader.</i>

691
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,027
Perspective.
Grab it with both hands, it's free.

692
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,193
See if he's got any sandwiches.

693
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,948
(Chris) Oh, thank Christ.

694
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,615
(sighs) Fucking hell.

695
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,583
I know, get your notebook out.

696
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,290
- Huh?
- Get your notebook out.

697
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,797
Come on, write down your ideas.

698
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,926
Just write down what's happened and
all your feelings and stuff like that.

699
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,636
- Yeah?
- Mmm!

700
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,638
- All right.
- Go on, get it down.

701
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,261
Oh, my God, Chris.

702
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,763
I'm musing.

703
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,647
I'm musing right now. Do you feel it?

704
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,152
My God, I feel amazing.

705
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,151
(sighs) Christ, that was hard.

706
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,828
I don't think I'll get
anything more out today.

707
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,656
I think you've found your oeuvre, Chris.

708
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,624
You're not gonna tell, are you?

709
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,332
No.

710
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,349
What are you looking at me
like that for?

711
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,394
This will put 'em off the scent.

712

713
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,848
Come on, give us a hand.

716
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,201
(Chris) If you could wish for anything,
what would it be?

717
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,875
Well, if I tell you, Chris,
it won't come true.

718
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,958
I just wanna be feared and respected.

719
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,586
It's not too much to ask
from life, is it?

720
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,597
Can't look at that any more.

721

730
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:47,021
(Chris) Ah, that is very nice.
Very nice indeed.

731
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,282
Hey, turn round. Turn round.

732
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,113
Why?

733
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,082
- There you go.
- Ooh!

734
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,201
- What do you think? Eh?
- It's an owl.

735
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,711
It's nice, innit?

736
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,219
Excuse me.

737
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,756
Sorry, mate.

738
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,725
Guys! Dinner in five minutes!

739
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,626
All right, mate?
Not seen one of these before.

740
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,297
It's a prototype.

741
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,967
Yeah, all the things that...
You know, all your practical stuff,

742
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,931
you keep down at the end by your feet.

743
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,682
Do you? Is that where you've got
your toolbox and stuff?

744
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:00,511
Yeah, yeah, I keep it down there,
like our wind-up torch and that,

745
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,437
-and, uh, my stove.
- Yeah?

746
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,939
Chris!

747
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,104
I'm ready!

748
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,403
...glass fibre epoxy struts,
as used in spacecraft extendable masts.

749
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:10,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

750
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,856
- I'm Chris, by the way.
- I'm Martin. Nice to meet you.

751
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,692
- Yeah, nice to meet you. Yeah.
- Yeah, you.

752
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,743
- Yeah, I was in plastics.
- Was ya?

753
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,366
Yeah, extrusion blow moulding.

754
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,322
No. Cor, they're given an hard time,
ain't they?

755
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,704
But, here, let's face it,
they're here to stay, mate.

756
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,251
Yeah, preaching to the choir, mate.

757
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,749
Right, yeah, yeah. Nice one. Yeah.

758
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,498
It looks like an alien's coffin.

759
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,630
I call it the Carapod. You know,
what with the ground displacement

760
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,008
of persons due to the instability
of geopolitics,

761
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:39,092
I'm hoping that this will become a whole
new way of living for economic migrants.

762
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,643
We're trying a whole new way of living.
Aren't we, Chris?

763
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,392
- Oh, are you?
- Tina hasn't travelled much.

764
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,475
Right, right, yeah. I hear you.
Hey, uh, you back later for a beer?

765
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,151
Oh, I don't really drink much but, um,

766
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,694
always up for a bit of smoke,
if you know what I mean.

767
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,362
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, great.
- Yeah? Great.

768
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,860
- Nice one.
- Cheers, Martin.

769
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,361
- Cheers. Chris?
- Yeah.

770
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,909
Yeah. Take care.

771
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,746
Right.

772
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,583

773
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,088

774
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:17,138
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
One in the pink,

775
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,722
-one on the sink!
-(all) One on the sink!

776
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,175
-(Chris) It's crazy, this.
- Thank you.

777
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,931
- Madam.
-(chuckles)

778
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,104
Thank you very much.
Uh, can I just ask you, actually,

779
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,182
I've got this, er...
I've got this voucher

780
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,393
-that I picked up about a week ago.
- Oh, right.

781
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:35,482
Hey, that dress looks a lot better
on you than it did on your mother.

782
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,490
I haven't got any knickers on.

783
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,951
Oh, clear, it looks like
your knife's fallen off the table.

784
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,709
I'll just have to go and pick it up.

785
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,878
I might be five minutes or so.

786
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,559
Can't see anything.

787
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,972
Well, I'm wearing tights.

788
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,023
You know all that stuff
that's been happening, you know...

789
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,771
It's all right, Chris.

790
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,946
It's all right,
because I understand you.

791
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,528
- And I know you...
- Do you?

792
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:23,158
...and I get it, 'cause it's just about
personal empowerment, isn't it?

793
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:27,413
It's just expressing yourself
and thinking outside the box.

794
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:31,621
And I've been in a box.
I don't wanna go back to the box, Chris.

795
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,082
I'd rather die. Do you know that?

796
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,171
You'd rather die?

797
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:42,055
Yeah. How romantic would that be?
If we both just died together.

798
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:46,681
Well, I mean, going to salsa's romantic.
We could maybe try that first.

799
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,014
What you're doing is
you're giving to the world.

800
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,232
Take carbon footprints.

801
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:55,895
By reducing people's lifespans,

802
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:58,481
technically,
you're reducing their emissions.

803
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:04,783
What, so you're saying that...
murder is green?

804
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,996
Hmm, I hadn't thought of it like that.
Thanks.

805
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,922
- This beard turns me on, Chris.
- I love it when you do that.

806
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,760
(women laughing)

807
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,385
- Ginger-minger!
-(all cheer)

808
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,511
What's the favourite thing I like to do?

809
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,688
Yeah. With me.

810
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,182
- Oh, well, that's obvious, innit?
-(chuckling)

811
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,609
- Put the bins out.
-(laughing)

812
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:41,236
I like to put the bins out...in my pants
and then have you come over

813
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,363
and rub bin juice all over me leg.

814
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,411
(laughing) What's bin juice?

815
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,079
You know, that bit that you get
at the bottom of the bin

816
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,623
-when all that stuff drips out.
- Oh, yeah.

817
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:51,416
(overlapping chatter)

818
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,084
- That was Dave!
- Wasn't his real name...

819

Don't be sick.

01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,468
You are really bloody stylish,
aren't you?

1010
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,383
- I know.
- Look at that! That's your style?

1011
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,639
Look, it's nothing personal.

1012
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,259
It's just,
you're a negative influence on me.

1013
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,935
Do you know that?

1014
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,813
I've done more murders
in the last fucking three days

1015
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,482
than in the entire six months
since I got made redundant.

1016
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,310
- Redundant?
- Yes.

1017
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,983
You said you'd taken a sabbatical.

1018
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:35,152
It doesn't matter.
You can't help it, you're evil.

1019
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:37,992
Maybe even a witch.
Yeah, you're a witch.

1020
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,494
You're a bloody witch.

1021
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:52,378
I don't think anyone
will be able to see him.

Yeah, bit off the beaten track, innit?

Come on, let's get you in the warm.

- Glad you made it, mate.

1051
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,632
Yeah, well, it's lovely
to be here, mate.

1052
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:15,437
You know, with a sort of marketing
strategy and a good production schedule,

1053
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,730
I think we could
make it work, yeah. Yeah.

1054
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,682
Actually, I was thinking
of going to see this guy in Spain.

1055
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:23,235
He's got, um, some amazing ideas
about combi-power inverters.

1056
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,404
- I mean, you must know about them.
- Yeah. Oh, right, cool, yeah.

1057
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,198
Well, here's to Carapod International.
Eh? Cheers.

01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,033
- Brilliant.
- Yeah, yeah.

1060
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:35,535
I'm going for a piss.

1061
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,241
Yeah, yeah, fine.

1062
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:40,748
It's, uh...

1063
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:44,128
Sorry, it's a bit squished in here.
Sorry. Um, just... (snorts)

01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:45,758
Yeah, he's a lovely bloke, isn't he?

1065
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:48,928
Oh, honestly, I'm so happy
I bumped into you guys.

1066
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,677
You know, I really need
a business partner, you know,

1067
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,508
'cause I come up with the ideas

1068
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:56,390
but I'm not good
at the organisational end of things.

1069
01:15:56,469 --> 01:16:00,599
So, you know, and, uh, I really bonded
with little Banjo over here.

1070
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:02,103
Who?

1071
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:06,438
That's his name, isn't it?
It's just that Chris said it was...

1072
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,359
Did he?

1073
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,901
(stammering nervously)
So did I get that wrong?

1074
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,746
Do you know what it's like
to be a woman, Martin?

1075
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,248
(chuckles) Uh, no. No.

1076
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,838
I do.

1077
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,336
Fine.

1078
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,509
It's not too bad, actually.

1079
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,507
Yeah, I imagine, yeah, yeah.

1080
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,759
He can be very controlling.

1081
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,758
- Really? Right. I...
- Very domineering.

1082
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:39,725
- Well, he's... Yeah.
- But you're not like that, are you?

1083
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:43,308
No, no. Me, I'm a pretty
easy-going guy really, yeah.

1084
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,688
Haven't you got lovely eyelashes?

1085
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,611
- Have I?
- Mmm.

1086
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,530
- Thanks very much. Yeah.
-(whispering) Kiss me.

1087
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:55,744
Martin, did you hear me?

1088
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,203
- Kiss me, Martin.
- Um...

1089
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,875
Just quickly before he comes back.

1090
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,541
- All right, mate?
- All right?

1091
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,089
- What?
- Cheers.

1092
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,011
- Cheers, yeah.
- Cheers. Here's to you.

1093
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:18,388
What?

1094
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:23,188
Martin just said
some filthy things to me, Chris.

1095
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:26,275
Yeah? Well, do tell. (chuckles)

1096
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,274
He said I was a dirty, slutty bitch.

1097
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,402
And he wanted to fuck me.

1098
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,702
And he said he wanted to shit
in my mouth and in my underwear,

1099
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:42,826
<i>and he said he wanted to shit in my hand
and make me use it as a brown lipstick.</i>

1100
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,545
(stammering) Mate, I... I...

1101
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:51,084
You know,
if Martin really said these things,

1102
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:55,968
then I've got no objection, in theory.

1103
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,431
- In theory?
- Yeah.

1104
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,264
What about practice, Chris?

1105
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,103
- Right. Um...
- Chris.

1106
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:15,366
Um, I'm gonna go to bed now, all right?
I'm... (exhales)

1107
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,614
Yeah, it's probably best,
actually, mate. Yeah, yeah.

1108
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,616
Yeah, it's been a long day.
Yeah, yeah, so I'll just...

1109
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,368
Yeah, I think we're probably
gonna turn in, too. So...

1110
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,701
Yeah, can I just...
Yeah, can I just, uh...

1111
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,286
Will you let Martin out, please?

1112
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,923
Right, cheers then, yeah.
See you in the morning.

(door closes)

1114
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,515
Why are you behaving
like that in front of Martin?!

1115
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:43,014
Why can't I have a friend?
You've got that bloody dog, Banjo!

1116
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:46,347
- POPPY!
-It's called Banjo!

-Banjo! '

1118
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:51,402
Just stop saying that
in front of the dog.

1119
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,104
You're giving him an identity crisis.

1120
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:57,237
How is he gonna have an identity crisis,
Chris, when he's a stupid fucking dog?
