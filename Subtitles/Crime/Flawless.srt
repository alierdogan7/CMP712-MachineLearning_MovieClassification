Well, yes.

Hold on one second.
One second.

Whoo! We should be careful
what we wish for. Hmm.

the early sixties,

started breaking
the boundaries,

the modern woman.

A lot of people who
turned up in our research

but you're...

29
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,580

to paint a picture.

You're hired by the London
Diamond Corporation.

32
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,660
It's number one in the world.
It is the fifties.

33
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,020
It's a fiercely
male-dominated environment.

34
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,740
You take on the men.

35
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,180
You battle your way up
and become... a manager.

Well, that's not going to
impress anyone these days,

37

but you were the only female
manager that had ever existed

38
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,340
in that company and I want
to know your story.

set foot in this city

are leading the charge.

for U.N. sanctions.

renewing their contracts.

if the soviets broke away,
it would be disastrous.

84
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,980
They could align
with Botswana,

or even Angola.

86
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,820
Combined production
would exceed our own.

87
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,260
We would no longer
control global supply.

88
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,100
The cartel collapses
and prices would free fall.

well above market.

break ranks.

No, he's
thinking straight.

In addition to being
several years my senior,

110

better suited to the position.

for themselves?

we simply extend it.

were on their way
here to sever all ties?

disassociate with London Diamond,

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,980
I've ever met,
and she's American.

181
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,020
Ran circles around
the lot of us at Oxford.

182
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,700
Of course I don't
talk to her anymore.

183
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,740
She turned me down
for dinner three times.

184
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,500
I was just
testing his resolve.

185
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,180
If he had tried one more
time, I would have said yes.

186
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,060
I'm with allied banking
heading up syndications.

187
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,940
We've just been sweating
over your accounts.

188
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,740
A lot of ice down there.

189
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,060
No doubt impressive, but
it's making people nervous.

190
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,180
But now I know you're here,

191
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,940
I can sleep a little easier.

192
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,220
Um, unless of course you're
considering a career change,

193
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,300
with allied banking,

194
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,820

can also be arranged.

195
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,140
Henry: Earliest and brightest
as usual, Miss Quinn.

196
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,700
Oh, I do my best, Henry.

197
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,660
Thank you.

198
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,900
No, you won't.

199

[Dramatic music playing]

200
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,500
Miss Quinn.
Miss Quinn.

201
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,780
Why don't we sit
in there?

202
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,220
Mr. Hobbs?

203
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,860
Yes.

204
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,660
Mr. Hobbs, I'm flattered,

205
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,540
but I'm... I'm... I'm
really not looking.

206
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,820
Oh, please... please
don't panic, Miss Quinn.

207
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,620
I'm... I'm a happily
married man.

208
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,420
And I wouldn't be
so courageous.

209
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,540
I... I have a proposal
to put to you.

210
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,660
It's... it's a trifle.

211
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,780
Just give me
five minutes. Please.

212
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,060
Come and sit.

213
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,700
It's something
I do to get sympathy.

214
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,300
War wound. The Blitz.

215
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,660
My wife and I, we went
for some music at Wilton's.

216
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,380
Very explosive performance.

217
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,100
Anyway, we both
survived that one,

218
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,500
only to find out that my wife
was living on borrowed time.

219
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,340
I thought you were
happily married?

220
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,780
Oh, I am, Miss Quinn.

221
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,380
And I always will be.

222
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,660
Are you always in the habit of
reading private correspondence?

223
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,060
Would you hold these
for me, please?

224
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,820
Correspondence?

225
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,980
This is more like
a diary of frustration.

226
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,940
"Number of Lon Di
subsidiaries worldwide 1,223."

227
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,820
"Number of female
Managing Directors, 0."

228
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,340
That first number
is not correct.

229
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,940
It's 1,224 now,

230
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,780
but the other number,
that is quite accurate.

231
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,340
You've succeeded
in arousing my curiosity.

232
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,580
Now, I'm wondering
what it is you want.

233
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,780
Well, I... I think the
question is, Miss Quinn, is,

234
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,860
what is it
that you want?

235
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,860
Hey, this is ridiculous.

236
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,460
They're... they're going
to knock over a bank

237
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,180
in the middle of London
in broad daylight.

238
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,860
I could have
your job for this.

239
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,860
Yeah, and they might
just give it to you.

240
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,260
I know that you've been
passed over six times

241
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,140
in the last three years

242
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,460
for someone less
qualified than you.

243
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,860
You know this has
been illuminating,

244
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,180
but I am really
am very, very busy.

245
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,380
Miss Quinn, please.
Please sit down.

246
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,820
Please sit down. Please.

247
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,940
I... I haven't got
to my point yet.

248
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,100
They're going
to fire you.

249
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,300
Excuse me?

250
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,660
Yes, your ingenious
Russian proposal.

251
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,180
How do you know
about that?

252
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,660
How do you know
all of my business?

253
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Shh!
Shh!

254
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,860
I'm only trying to help.

255
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,700
You know,
it's extraordinary

256
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,780
the conversations people will
have in front of their cleaners.

257
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,740
It's like...
like we don't exist.

258
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,460
What conversations?

259
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,940
Well, I'm not a businessman,

260
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,500
but I certainly
got the gist of it.

261
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,780
What conversations?

262
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,100
Well, the Russians
won't accept your plan

263
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,060
unless it's kept secret
among senior staff...

264
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,340
and only
the senior staff.

265
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,940
They don't seem to think
that you qualify.

266
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,260
Well, I don't believe you.

267
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,380
Well, uh, you...
you're probably right.

268
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,660
The ramblings
of an old man, eh?

269
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,580
Who would notice?

270
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,180
Hey, this is a good bit.

271
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,460
Look there.

272
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,980
Would you like a peanut?

273
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,220
Oh, is MKA in?

274
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,180
He's just left.
That's odd.

275
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,420
Someone from the Prime
Minister's Office is in the lobby.

276
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,700
Says he has
an appointment.

277
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,780
Hmm.

278
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,180
Oh, no, that's
not right at all.

279
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,340
Ahem.

280
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,580
Well, I seem
to be the end

281
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,660
of the whole restaurant.

282
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,340
You look wonderful.

283
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,660
Well, I heard reinvention
was the latest craze.

284
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,740
Thought I'd try
it on for size.

285
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,180
Thank you for seeing me.

286
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,060
Well, don't thank me
too quickly.

287
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,820
Um, ahem.

288
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,300
It's bad news, I'm afraid.

289
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,220
We can't offer you a position.

290
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,380
Really, why not?

291
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,820
There's a conflict
of interests.

back to the Boer War.

We funded Ernest Ashtoncroft's
first diamond mines 70 years ago.

294
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,140
Well, it's done
all the time.

295
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,980
You simply ask their
permission to speak with me.

296
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,300
Say I know nothing
about it, unsolicited.

297
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,700
That sort of thing.
I did.

298
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,020
Look, and I tell you this
in confidence as an old friend.

299
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,260
But they're saying you're
grossly incompetent.

300
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,500
Claim you botched their
relations with the Russians.

301
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,020
That is absolutely
ridiculous.

302
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,780
I am sorry.

303
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,460
Word came down quietly you
are not to be touched by us

304
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,300
or in all likelihood by anyone
doing business with Lon Di.

305
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,700
Well, that's every
last company on earth.

306
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,100
You said you, um,
had something else to discuss.

307
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,140
Well, I... I feel
stupid now.

308
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,060
I was going to finally
accept your offer of dinner.

309
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,380
Well, that, um, would have
to be unadventurous.

girls to prove it.

over one Sunday.

Mmm, good soup.

315
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,060
Very early
and very long.

the afternoon off.

Oh, I never gamble.

320
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,700
Not on dogs, cards,
or strangers.

321
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,140
You were right.

322
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,500
Was I?

323
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,420
Why do you want to steal
from the company?

324
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,820
Who said I did?

325
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,300
Hypothetically.

326
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,580
War and plunder,

327
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,260
the two most reliable
sources of income.

328
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,340
I didn't realize
we were at war.

[Bell ringing]

330
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,340
In six months' time

331
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,900
I shall retire
to a hearty pat on the back

a situation
in dire need of attention.

334
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,020
So money, plain
and simple?

335
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,380
Suppose I wanted to do
something for my wife.

336
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,500
Your wife
who died 15 years ago?

337
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,220
The one you're
happily married to?

338
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,180
Lovely. You did
your homework.

339
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,740
I guess you would.

340
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,580
What else
did you uncover?

341
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,980
That you're far
from stupid,

342
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,220
and you were forced to
apprentice under your father,

with the drinking problem.

344
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,820
Oh, yes, married at 21 and years
later when your wife became ill,

345
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,420
you took the night job
at London Diamonds

346
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,980
so you could spend
your days by her side.

347
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,220
You never did use
those qualifications.

348
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,940
Clever, Miss Quinn.

349
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,260
Clever.

00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,980
How do you know
I won't turn you in?

351
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,060
Are we still speaking
hypothetically?

352
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,540
I mean, what makes you think
you can pull off such a thing?

353
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,100
Well, simply because
I have a plan.

354
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,620
What I propose involves
the least possible risk

355
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,620
because we don't have to
change our normal routines.

356
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,740
Each night at 9:00...

357
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,740
they lock the front doors,

358
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,420
which means,
that for 10 hours,

359
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,380
no one can go in
or out of the building.

360
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,020
They increase the security
on the main floor

361
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,820
but on the lower floor they
just keep these two guards,

362
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,180
here and here
by the lift,

363
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,500
which is the sole
point of access.

364
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,380
You intend to go
for the vault?

365
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,900
That's where
the diamonds are.

366
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,180
You can't be serious.

367
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,180
Generally, each evening I
start on the fourth floor

368
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,740
and work
me way down, see?

369
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,540
Nice day today.

370
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,780
Once through
the outer floors

371
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,820
I'm escorted
to the sub basement.

372
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,300
The next few hours are
spent on rubbish collection,

373
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,460
mopping, waxing, minor
repair and maintenance.

374
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,820
During that time,
I'll work mostly unattended.

375
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,420
Once an hour or so,
someone checks up on me.

376
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,580
Otherwise, I'm
left entirely to myself.

377
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,860
I mean, in theory,

378
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,060
I could take off all my
clothes and walk around naked.

379
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,820
A frightening thought,
Miss Quinn.

380
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,420
Don't dwell on it.

381
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,300
I'll try not to.

382
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,500
I've saved the vault
hallway for last.

383
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,580
The long corridor that leads
to a circular door,

384
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,060
behind which

385
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,500
lies one of the largest singular
deposits of riches on earth.

386
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,540
For 16 years
I've been working

387
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,860
within a hare's
breath of that door,

388
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,340
and for 16 years I've never
opened it, not once.

389
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,620
You couldn't if you wanted
to, not without the codes.

390
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,500
The codes are changed weekly
and entrusted to only two people.

391
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,620
Mr. Eaton, lifelong company
servant, portrait of reliability.

392
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,100
Rumor has it that the swiss use
his pulse to set their clocks by.

393
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,740
And, of course, Sir Milton
Kendrick Ashtoncroft,

394
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,300
aging ruler of everything
that daylight touches.

395
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,660
And you plan to obtain
the codes how?

396
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,780
That's where you come in,
Miss Quinn.

397
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,740
Until recently, this was
supposed to be a solo operation.

398
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,900
A year ago, quite by accident,

399
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,060
I discovered that Sir Milton kept
the codes concealed in his desk.

400
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,100
Then some months back,
they were gone.

401
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,460
Night after night,

402
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,540
I searched the office,
but they never turned up.

403
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,580
Why'd you wait?

404
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,380
Why not do it while
you had the chance?

405
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,580
Oh, I've asked myself that
question a thousand times.

406
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,060
I told you, I'm...
I'm not courageous.

407
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,140
But my hesitating
will be your gain.

408
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,380
Will it?

409
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,740
And what will
that require?

410
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,180
Here, proof of conviction.

411
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,260
You are on the, uh,
guest list, are you?

412
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,460
It's business.
I'm expected.

413
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,420
We're entertaining
the Russians.

414
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
You suspect he keeps
the codes at home?

415
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,100
On Saturday, go to his study

416
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,460
and look under the center
drawer in his desk.

417
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,940
This is ridiculous.

418
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,620
Say I did find the codes

419
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,500
and you were able to slip in
and out of the vault undetected.

420
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,060
How would you get the
diamonds out of the building?

421
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,820
How much will it hold?

422
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,700
How much would
you like it to hold?

423
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,220
What's the price of revenge?

424
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,620
Difficult, eh?

425
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,580
Would a million pound do?

426
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,180
Each?
I should think so.

427
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,820
They wouldn't even
notice that much.

428
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,100
Well, by then...

429
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,660
I'll be retired and
you'll have been let go.

430
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,820
Why should I trust you?

431
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,540
The same reason
I have to trust you.

432
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,020
We have the same objective.

433
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,780
Oh, you make it all
sound so easy.

434
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,940
Is that a yes?

435
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,340
No, it isn't.

436
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,740
Be sure to wear
something nice.

437
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,900
Good evening, sir.

438
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,020
Come on in.

439
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,420
The Russians here?

440
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,580
[Classical music playing]

441
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,220
To pressurized carbon.

442
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,660
Here here!

443
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,020
Now that's
a sight worth seeing.

444
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,500
Sir Clifton Sinclair, our
very own insurance man,

445
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,500
making a rare trip down from
his ivory tower at King's Row.

446
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,620
No doubt losing sleep over our
somewhat top heavy inventory.

447
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,460
Oh, I don't think Sinclair's
the type to lose sleep.

448
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,300
It's rather unnerving
to consider a man

449
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,220
with that history as London
diamond's greatest guarantor.

450
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,140
Ooh, you didn't know.

451
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,260
He was mixed up in all
those insurance scandals

452
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,460
before the national
health service.

453
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,380
Of course, he's
completely innocent,

454
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,060
or he was never prosecuted.

455
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,300
Otherwise, we wouldn't
do business together.

456
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,340
Allow me to present
Vladimir Dmitriev,

457
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,740
head of the Soviet
Diamond Authority.

458
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,540
Mr. Chanson,
my second in command.

459
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,660
How do you do?

460
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,300
And miss
Laura Quinn,

brightest gems.

[Speaking Russian]

463
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,420
Ballet, vodka, diamonds,

464
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,580
the three things closest
to the Russian soul.

465
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,860
And which do you prefer?

466
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,300
Diamonds, of course.

467
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,700
I'll drink to that.

468
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,460
My lord!

469
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,660
And what would you have
done had I said ballet?

470
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,140
I would ask you to dance.

471
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,420
Of course, I have
ulterior motives.

472
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,660
And, um, what makes
you think I don't?

473
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,380
I shall miss her.

474
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,780
How's the old man
bearing up?

475
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,700
Oh, I expect
he'll outlive us all.

476
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,140
Well, I only ask because
I should think hoarding

477
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,540
basically a worthless commodity
would be very bad for his heart.

478
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,980
What am I doing?

479
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,620
I ask myself that
repeatedly.

480
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,260
Sorry.
I didn't see you.

481
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,180
Purely by design.

482
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,260
You've stumbled into my lair,
my sanctuary of sorts.

483
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,460
Yes, I think I know
what you mean.

At least the evening
is a success.

no expense.

Never does,
always first class,

00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,500
so long as it's discreet
and doesn't attract attention.

488
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,340
Yes, he's famous
for his discretion.

489
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,340
Is it true he paid 100
pounds to the families

who died in protest?

does such a thing?

the heat in my office.

Uh, Miss Quinn,
do you want...

499
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,420
more or less heat
in your office?

500

If we do this, I want
to know every last detail.

502
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,740
Ok.

Cameras in the building?

510
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,180
Yes, inside, outside,
halls, lobby.

No, but
the vault corridor.

513

security guards staring

of diamonds all day.

515
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,260
Can you blame them?

516
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,260
Oh, security cameras,
goodness gracious.

517
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,780

think up next?

around them?

No, absolutely not.

530
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,740
And you came all the way
over to the wrong side

531
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,180
of town to tell me...

532
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,180
when you could've
told me tonight.

533
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,220
You've seen a way,
haven't you?

534
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,980
I have not, Mr. Hobbs.

535
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,540
Your tenacity reminds
me of my wife.

536
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,060
Why are you being
so persistent?

537
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,500
Because I hate
English winters.

538
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,540
Now, tell me how
it can be done.

539
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,540
All right. There's
one possibility,

540
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,780
but I'm telling you,
it won't work.

541
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,620
Although there are eight
cameras in the sub basement,

542
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,380
only four images are on
screen at any one time.

543
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,580
Four on, four off,

544
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,140
and since the images cycle
in 15-second intervals,

545
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,660
they reappear
in the order they leave.

546
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,260
So each image
is off-screen for...

547
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,700
60 seconds, yeah?

548
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,100
Yeah, 60 seconds,
but that's not enough time.

549
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,220
Enough time?

550
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,580
I'll be in that vault
in 10 seconds flat.

551
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,340
You can't be standing
outside the vault

552
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,780
when the image goes
off screen

553
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,380
and be nowhere in sight
when it reappears.

554
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,300
You have to start
at the end of the corridor,

555
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,660
and that's 40 yards long.

556
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,380
Well, I don't have
a problem with that.

557
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,140
With all due respect,
Mr. Hobbs,

558
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,220
you can hardly walk,
let alone run.

559
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,420
I'm telling you,
I can do it.

560
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,740
This has gone too far.

561
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,460
I'm sorry.

562
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,660
You're involved now,
whether you like it or not.

563
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,060
I beg your pardon.

564
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,300
You gave me the code, Miss
Quinn, so you're involved.

565
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,500
Make no mistake.

566
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,820
I'm going through
with this.

567
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,420
And don't you pretend
to me that you don't want it,

568
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,340
because you want
it more than I do.

569
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,180
You want a life that means
something that adds up.

570
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,180
And you know that this is the
only way you're going to get it.

571
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,140
Miss Quinn,
you said it yourself.

572
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,820
They're never going
to notice it.

573
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,980
This is how it'll work.

574
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,460
Tomorrow we'll
synchronize our watches,

575
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,660
but it has
to be tomorrow

576
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,380
before they realize
the flaw in the system.

577
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,620
At the exact moment you're
at the vault corridor,

578
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,180
I'll call
the guard station.

579
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,980
That should buy you at
least 30 more seconds.

580
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,980
When this is over, I think
best we not speak again.

581
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,380
Evening, Miss Quinn.

582
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,140
Evening, Henry.

583
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,300
Evening, Henry.
Albert.

584
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,580
Evening, Miss Quinn.
May I?

585
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,220
What's the word,
Henry?

586
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,140
Ask me again on Friday.

587
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,340
Good night, sir.

588
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,460
Good night.

589
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:27,980
Ah!

590
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,820
Ah!

591
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,300
Damn it.

592
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,180
[Telephone ringing]

593
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,340
Willis.

594
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,060
Hello?

595
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,620
[Traffic drowning dialogue]

596
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,100
[Music drowning out dialogue]

597
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,500
Man: Halt!

598
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,500
I'm afraid
there's a problem.

599
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,140
If you won't mind,
come along with me.

600
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,100
Uh...

601
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,460
Mr. Lewis, I'm afraid.

602
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,460
God knows what
that man ingests.

603
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,300
Would you mind?

604
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,500
I'll, uh,
leave you to it.

605
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,980
Mr. Hobbs.

606
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,140
Morning, Miss Quinn.

607
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,220
How are things
this morning, Henry?

608
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,100
In a word, dull.
