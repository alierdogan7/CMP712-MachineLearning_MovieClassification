1
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,792
Bye, honey.

2
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,670
See you at six o'clock
at the station.

3
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,268
To speak properly it is necessary
to enunciate every syllable.

4
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,355
Example: 20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

5
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,274
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

6
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,798
Example: 20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

7
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,192
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

8
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,670
- This is like a lavender.
- Yes, it goes well with white.

9
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,670
Exquisite combination, Mr. Siegel.
Just as tasteful as always.

10
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,349
- Mr. Siegel. Floor please, madam?
- Penthouse.

11
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,593
lf we make love,
it'll be the only time.

12
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,759
- What if you like it?
- l know l'll like it.

13
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,229
- l got off on the wrong floor.
- You'd better get back on.

14
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,148
- Don't stop ...
- ls that hurting?

15
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,997
Meyer, l've got half an hour.
l've got ten minutes of sunlamp ...

16
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,391
All right,
l'll do the sunlamp on the train.

17
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,236
Of course l'm alone.
She was an hour ago.

18
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,755
l've got to do it.

19
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,277
Call Charlie. He likes to take a nap
when there's going to be trouble.

20
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,115
Ben, it really affects my opinion
of your ability to administrate -

21
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,836
- when you get yourself involved in
this type of detail. Right, Charlie?

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,549
- Of course.
- See what l'm talking about?

23
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,395
- You just shook his head.
- What else was l gonna to do?

24
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,670
Count to 53.

25
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,912
- Good evening, Mr. Siegel.
- Hi, give that a brush for me.

26
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,919
- Weren't you going to California?
- l came to give you a present.

27
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,433
- Present?
- Yeah, open it.

28
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,159
- l don't get it.
- We hired you to do a job.

29
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,558
We pay you a nice salary,
we throw in a piece of the action -

30
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,429
- and you pay us back
by stealing from us.

31
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,832
Do you want the shirt off my back?
l'd be happy to give it you.

32
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,151
Here, from Sulka's.
They're the ones l wear.

33
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,075
lf l'd taken longer, l'd have
bought some pants and some suits.

34
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,349
But l can give you some tips.
Let me see your shoes.

35
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,197
l don't want to be rude to you,
but they don't go with anything.

36
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,349
$3,900 we paid three guys to take
care of this. Why are we here?

37
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,993
You know his thinking process.
Ben has only one problem.

38
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,517
The same problem he had when
we were kids together on the street.

39
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,956
He doesn't respect money.

40
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,353
But that's for summer ... and you
don't have to worry about summer.

41
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,116
lf it was just business, l'd sell
insurance or import dresses.

42
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,193
The key to taking over Jack Dragna's
Southern California rackets -

43
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,718
- is to come in smooth. Approach
him like we want to be a partner.

44
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,271
The guy's been running the rackets
for 20 years with no competition.

45
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,112
- Except for Mickey Cohen.
- So we move in amiably.

46
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,592
- What about the bars and clubs?
- Fifty-fifty.

47
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,070
We move in,
but we don't ruin anything.

48
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,190
- Joey A. knows Jack Dragna.
- Jack's a cold-blooded killer.

49
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,593
You've got to be careful. Don't say
nothing he'd take offence at.

50
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,550
- What are you smiling at?
- Nothing.

51
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,113
- Why can't we go to California?
- Maybe next time.

52
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,716
When you get to Los Angeles,
don't call George.

53
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,476
He's a movie star now, and attracts
more attention than Roosevelt.

54
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,468
- This has to be quick and quiet.
- And amiable.

55
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,910
Very funny.1 2 days.

56
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,791
Four days out. Four days
of diplomacy. Four days back.

57
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,718
- Ben, could l talk to you a minute?
- After l say goodbye to the family.

58
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,755
l'll miss you.

59
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,550
When l get you on the phone,
tell me what presents you want.

60
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,596
- l already know what l want.
- Don't tell me now. Think about it.

61
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,073
- l need money, Ben. $50,000.
- For what?

62
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,678
The cops, the D.A., the FBl.
They're threatening to lock me up.

63
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,197
They're no good, these people,
except assistant D.A. Allen Stein.

64
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,352
Jewish kid.
His family's from Bedford Street.

65
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,911
What happened to the 50,000
for the armoured truck heist?

66
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,757
lt's gone. You know me with money,
l blew it at the track.

67
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,233
Are you saying that if you don't
get it you're going to rat on me?

68
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,838
You? Never. l love you, Ben.
l would never rat on you.

69
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,275
You ain't gonna kill me, are you?

70
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,713
l'm going to try very hard
to forget that this ever happened.

71
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,040
- l owe you my life, Ben.
- l'd say that's a fair assessment.

72
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,556
Bend your knees, Harry.

73
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,192
When you jump from the train, bend
your knees to soften the impact.

74
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,070
Okay, Ben. Sure thing.

75
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,795
This has been four of the most
wonderful days l've ever spent.

76
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,715
A lot of it
was in the motion of the train.

77
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,596
He knows you. Are you somebody, too?
l love you, George.

78
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,835
- You look like a million bucks.
- You're looking good yourself.

79
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,471
Well, that's what they pay me for.
Okay, we're moving on here.

80
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,798
You're at the Beverly Hills Hotel,
bungalow five.

81
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,755
l know you said four days,
but l reserved six.

82
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,309
- Jack Dragna's the kingpin here.
- He runs a nice little operation.

83
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,712
<i>You've got a city with 3 million
people and his operation is little?</i>

84
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,078
Less to worry about. l'll drop you,
then run back to the studio.

85
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,710
- Why don't l go with you?
- lf you like.

86
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,678
Hank's my friend. A dame like you
will give him a lot of headaches.

87
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,594
- l'm on to you.
- The blueprints are all drawn.

88
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,032
- New cigarette.
- She's eaten a whole cigarette.

89
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,955
Forget that you've ever seen him.
Here, get what l mean?

90
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,715
Take that money
and buy yourself some manners.

91
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,639
To waste on you?

92
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,918
Two bucks for one beer
and some phoney champagne?

93
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,595
Here's half a buck.
Split it between you.

94
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,632
Two bucks for one beer
and some phoney champagne?

95
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,874
- Here's half a buck.
- You're so cheap you're wholesale.

96
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,476
Don't forget, mister,
l asked you nice.

97
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,831
Rolling, quiet please.

98
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,750
Benny, you want to hit somebody
with a chair?

99
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,559
With this
l can hit home runs all night.

100
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,998
- Take this in case l come back.
- Can't l have a line?

101
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,833
Honey, he's the star.

102
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,040
- That was impressive, Georgie boy.
- l'm a pro.

103
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,430
- That was impressive, Georgie boy.
- l'm a pro.

104
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,708
May l?

105
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,350
lf you want an answer,
finish the question.

106
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,990
- Light your cigarette?
- Sure.

107
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,388
l thought you were going to ask me
something a little more exciting.

108
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,348
- Like what?
- Use your imagination.

109
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,753
- l'm using it.
- Let me know when you're finished.

110
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,433
ls she a bit player?

111
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,277
Flamingo? Not for Joey Adonis.
That's Virginia Hill.

112
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,350
Joey's crazy. No woman is worth
a bullet between the eyes.

113
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,155
lt depends on whose eyes
and which woman.

114
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:15,074
Why is Ben Siegel so interested in
a gal who's going with his friend?

115
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,916
Joey A? He's just an associate.
Are you still going with him?

116
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,477
lf it were New Year's Eve, he'd be
my date. Who would your date be?

117
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,634
Wife. Esta. E-S-T-A.

118
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,954
l'll bet Esta lives her life
faithful to her one and only Ben, -

119
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,039
- who plays around like a jackrabbit
and lies through his teeth.

120
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,558
- l don't lie to Esta.
- Do you confess your sins to her?

121
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,513
What exactly does Mr. Esta
want from Miss Virginia?

122
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,153
Mr. Esta can't imagine anything
he doesn't want from Miss Virginia.

123
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,995
- Are you ready for a divorce?
- Never.

124
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,312
You're pretty ferocious
where Mom is concerned.

125
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,190
The rest of the time you're just
a sweet-talking, fuck-happy fellow -

126
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,114
- with some good dialogue.
Dialogue's cheap in Hollywood.

127
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,432
Why don't you run outside
and jerk yourself a soda?

128
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,153
How would someone go about
getting a screen test done?

129
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,469
- Do you know someone who wants one?
- No, l'm just interested.

130
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,235
What about Virginia Hill?
Does she have a future in movies?

131
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,399
l'm not sure of my own future.
Lana Turner lives there.

132
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,472
Cesar Romero lives there.

133
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,872
Gary Cooper is there on the right.
He paid 45 grand.

134
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,635
- Houses bring that kind of money?
- Sure, and more.

135
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,078
- Who's is that?
- Lawrence ... The opera singer.

136
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,156
- Not Melchoir, the other guy.
- Lawrence Tibbett? Stop.

137
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,996
- What are you doing?
- Paying my respects.

138
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,559
l'm looking for Lawrence Tibbett.
My name's Ben Siegel.

139
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,554
- ls he expecting you?
- Not unless he's psychic.

140
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,350
Would you excuse me a moment?

141
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,158
- How far is your house from here?
- Half a mile. What are you doing?

142
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,634
Mr. Siegel.

143
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,952
You have no idea
what an honour it is to meet you.

144
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,069
l took my family to hear you sing
''Rigoletto'' at the Met last year.

145
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,110
- lt was a great evening.
- You overwhelm me, Mr. Siegel.

146
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,549
- That's beautiful.
- Are you related to Bugsy Siegel?

147
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,832
- ''Bugsy''? What do you mean?
- l beg your pardon.

148
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,391
A bug is nothing.
The word has no meaning.

149
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,797
A bug is a colloquialism.
lt has no basis in reality.

150
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,238
lnsects include a wide variety
of living creatures.

151
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,597
None of them can be called a bug!

152
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,912
l certainly didn't mean
any offence, Mr. Siegel.

153
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,192
Mind if l look around, Larry?

154
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,037
- Do you mind if l call you Larry?
- All my friends call me Larry.

155
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,677
- What brings you to L.A., Ben?
- Curiosity.

156
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,635
A wonderful house. What do you
think of the Beverly Hills Hotel?

157
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,271
- lt's the best hotel in town.
- A bungalow or a suite?

158
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,077
- A bungalow. Which do you have?
- l don't. You do. Bungalow 5.

159
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,596
- l don't understand ...
- l'm buying this house.

160
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,709
- This house isn't for sale.
- Sure it is. Everything's for sale.

161
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,112
- How much do you want?
- Mr. Siegel ...

162
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,158
- Ben.
- Ben ...

163
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,313
Why are you looking at me like that?
Are you going to hurt me?

164
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,314
l would protect you
from anyone who tried to hurt you.

165
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,514
Your voice makes life justifiable.
l'm just trying to give you money.

166
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,036
- What did you buy it for?
- $35,000.

167
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,716
But that was a few years ago.
l could probably get $40,000.

168
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,750
lt's not really a financial issue,
Mr. Siegel. Ben ...

169
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,798
One, two, three, four ...

170
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,032
That's $50,000. ls that enough?

171
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,309
This should be a pleasurable day
for the both of us. Here's $60,000.

172
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,031
lt makes me sick inside when l don't
bring pleasure to someone l admire.

173
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,199
Doesn't this bring you pleasure?
Why don't l see you smiling?

174
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,594
- You spend money like crazy.
- So? lt's only dirty paper.

175
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,276
- You'll only be here for four days.
- Maybe l'll stay a little longer.

176
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,598
- l've got to get to Jack Dragna's.
- l'll drive you.

177
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,189
No, this is business.

178
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,034
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

179
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,597
- Louie.
- What the hell is this?

180
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,837
l'm looking for Jack Dragna.
l'm Ben Siegel.

181
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,828
l'm Lou, Jack's brother.
l'll tell Jack you're here.

182
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,636
He'll just be a few seconds.
Jack's finishing eating.

183
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,113
We run a smooth little operation.
With all due respect to Lansky, -

184
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,637
- Luciano, Joey A., and whoever
the fuck else you represent, -

185
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,713
- l suggest you spend your time here
looking for broads.

186
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,079
We've got the finest in the world.
l understand that's what you like.

187
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,074
l can help you out
with phone numbers.

188
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:02,196
But if you want to do business,
l'm completely disinterested.

189
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,115
''Uninterested.''
Disinterested means impartial.

190
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,758
You've got two alternatives:
You and your guys can work for us.

191
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,469
Your little operation
will then be a big operation.

192
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,078
20 betting parlours, not three.
Owning your own wire service.

193
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,518
lt means taking risks.
Meyer, Charlie and l, we take 75%.

194
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,435
You keep 25%, but that's got to be
three times more than you make now.

195
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,395
- What's the second alternative?
- The second alternative ...

196
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,558
The second alternative is here.

197
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:47,118
- Squeeze the trigger and kill me.
- Kill you, that's an alternative?

198
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,428
- You've an unusual sense of humour.
- What they say about you is true.

199
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,273
You're out of your fucking mind.

200
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,600
Take another five seconds
to make your selection.

201
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,512
l guess that means you're working
for us. May l have my gun back?

202
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,116
Let's get started. Time is vicious
when taken for granted.

203
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,355
Bugsy, if we break off this thing
with Transcontinental ...

204
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:39,518
l'll assume you didn't know
that no one calls me that.

205
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,073
- Very nice meeting you, Jack.
- The fucking guy's crazy.

206
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,839
- Should l shoot him in the back?
- Lansky and Luciano would flip.

207
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,912
Play along.
Sooner or later he'll blow his lid.

208
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,074
When we get him,
nobody will give a fuck.

209
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,311
- Hello?
- Virginia, it's Ben ...

210
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,953
Meyer, l know we said 1 2 days.
Things got a little complicated.

211
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,156
Was that good?
You're from ''The Herald'', right?

212
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,275
See that they run that, and not one
of those sinister mugshots.

213
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,711
- l'll try my best.
- l'd really appreciate it.

214
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,350
- May l have the next dance?
- Charmed. Have you met Mr. Siegel?

215
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,150
- l've been admiring his movements.
- My husband. Count Di Frasso.

216
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,394
l'm surrounded by titles.
How can l pick one up?

217
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,195
Darling, get him a title.
Make him a duke.

218
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,148
Why not?

219
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,952
- Are you ready to come to ltaly?
- ltaly! l'll get my parachute.

220
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,315
That's wonderful.

221
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,878
You know who one of the count's
best friends is?

222
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,759
Mussolini.

223
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,240
No ... That clown knows Mussolini?

224
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,548
Do they play golf together?
Tell jokes about the gas chambers?

225
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,073
- l stay out of politics.
- Politics? This is war.

226
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,109
He's Hitler's partner, and this
effete count pals around with him?

227
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,990
Don't get worked up over something
you can't do anything about.

228
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,630
This is Hollywood.

229
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,316
Telephone call from Mr. Dragna.
l've placed a phone at your table.

230
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,150
Have you met our number-one
crime fighter James McWilde?

231
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,957
- He's up for re-election as D.A.
- l wish l could contribute.

232
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,915
You can contact Donald Mitchell.
He handles all the money.

233
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,640
Have him call me in the morning.

234
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,828
lf you'll excuse me, l see about
six women that need to talk to me.

235
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,437
Mr. McWilde, as a man of the world,
what do you make -

236
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,388
- of all these friends of Mussolini
flitting around America?

237
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,717
Are you talking about spies?

238
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,475
Come Jim, the senator
would like a word with you.

239
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,714
- Keep me posted on that.
- l will, we've got to do something.

240
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,072
See the redhead?

241
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,237
Put it in her hand.

242
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,676
What is it?

243
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,109
<i>This cocksucker Mickey Cohen
robbed our gambling joint of $56,000.</i>

244
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,832
<i>I tell you, this time
I'm going to get him.</i>

245
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,350
l'll see you.

246
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,392
- How do you know it was Cohen?
- He had a mask on, but the voice.

247
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,078
He robbed five guys of $56,000
and got away scot-free?

248
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,119
- He took us by surprise.
- lt certainly seems like it.

249
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:09,436
- He'll be dead within 2 4 hours.
- No, l want to talk to him.

250
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:17,950
- You say 56,000?
- The exact figure was 56,1 43.

251
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,551
<i>Mussolini and Hitler
must be stopped.</i>

252
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,675
Hello ...
Hi, honey.

253
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,715
Maybe you should stop thinking about
when l'm coming back to Scarsdale.

254
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,919
Start thinking about when you
and the girls will come out here.

255
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,469
As soon as possible.

256
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,350
But is this is the right time
to take the kids out of school?

257
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,275
Maybe we should play it by ear
and see what happens.

258
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,911
We don't have
to settle everything now.

259
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,790
All right, we'll see each other
before you know it.

260
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,112
Right? l love you too, Esta.
Goodnight.

261
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,559
Ronald, turn off the projector!

262
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,196
Ronald? Where are you?

263
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,393
- Am l coming at a bad time?
- Not at all. Come on in.

264
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,996
l don't want to interrupt
your pantomime.

265
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,952
What are you watching?

266
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:38,390
A newsreel, but it's over.
Why don't you come on in?

267
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,272
- Too fast with the ring?
- Nothing's too fast that fits.

268
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,597
Do you always carry around
a spare ring?

269
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,117
l figured l'd run into you.
Would you ever have called me?

270
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,070
l was planning to wait a while.

271
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,800
About ten years.

272
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,753
Why?

273
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,311
lf all we're going to do is bring
each other misery and torment ...

274
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,830
Why would we
bring each other misery and torment?

275
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:23,831
We both want what we want whenever
we want it, and we want everything.

276
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,155
- That doesn't sound too promising.
- That's what l'm saying.

277
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,035
- Then why did you come?
- Well, it wasn't caution.

278
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,995
- What about Joey A.?
- Does he bother you?

279
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,079
ls it your conscience or are you
worried about your business?

280
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,676
l haven't thought it through
that clearly.

281
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,756
lf he knew l were here, he'd only
be thinking about who to kill first.

282
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,037
Do you want to kiss me
as much as l want to kiss you?

283
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,591
How do you know
l want to kiss you at all?

284
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,270
l really don't think we should
go through with this, do you?

285
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,876
ls that yes or no?

286
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,958
Both.

287
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,874
- You pack quite a punch.
- That was a slap.

288
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,953
lf l'd punched you, you'd be
stretched out across the floor.

289
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,989
You're right about everything.
Right about the misery and torment.

290
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,357
l'm sure you're right
about what you want.

291
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,355
Do you always talk this much
before you do it?

292
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,435
l only talk this much
before l'm gonna kill someone.

293
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,113
Hey, Georgie boy.
Did you find Mickey Cohen yet?

294
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,797
Biltmore Health Club at one o'clock.
We meet him there.

295
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,359
Pick me up at noon. Good.

296
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,156
You still think we'll only bring
each other misery and torment?

297
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,909
With a few distractions in between.

298
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,516
You call what we've been doing
distractions?

299
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:39,277
- Thank you, the feeling's mutual.
- Good, that's the way l like it.

300
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,115
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

301
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,239
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

302
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,710
- What time is it?
- One thirty.

303
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,077
The little schmuck
is half an hour late.

304
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,677
Who's a little schmuck?
Who are you referring to?

305
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,913
- You'd better show me some respect.
- You've got it backwards.

306
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,518
Unless your idea of showing
a man respect is to rob him.

307
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,118
Who said l robbed?
Everything l've got is mine.

308
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:22,829
- Yes, you stole it from me.
- What's mine is mine.

309
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,358
l understand from Jack Dragna
you stole 56,000 and change.

310
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,433
The lying fat fuck!
lt was 42, not 56.

311
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,390
- l thought you didn't steal it.
- lf l had, it would have been 42.

312
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,633
lf l were you, l'd give that money
back by seven o'clock tonight.

313
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,588
Fuck you!
Look at me, fuck you!

314
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,276
lf l was you, l'd shut
my fucking mouth and watch my step.

315
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,833
- l could blow you away.
- Aren't we in a public place?

316
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,278
We'd both be better off
if you'd tone down your rhetoric.

317
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,151
We'd both be better off if
l never saw your fucking face again.

318
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,236
- Don't laugh, this guy's deranged.
- Go get him back. Hurry up.

319
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,914
Jack ... it's Ben.

320
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:30,309
The Cohen thing is under control.
Be at my house at 7:30 tonight.

321
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,398
How do you remember
all the fucking lines from a movie?

322
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,674
Make it quick, will you?
l've got a hot date waiting for me.

323
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,116
<i>l bet you do have
a hot date waiting for you.</i>

324
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,035
- Are you making fun of me?
- You must have women lined up.

325
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,479
When l go out with a broad,
you can bet she'll be a star.

326
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,795
Betty Grable or Ava Gardner.
l don't go for them tarty broads.

327
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,590
- What tarty broads?
- That Shirley, Luciano's piece.

328
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:18,075
That nutty broad Joey A. goes out
with, Victoria Hill. That blonde ...

329
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,357
<i>Virginia Hill.
Why would you call her a tart?</i>

330
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,998
That's what she is. Joe Epstein,
the drummer Gene Krupa, -

331
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,554
- the bullfighter from Mexico ...
This conversation is beneath me.

332
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,475
l'm expanding,
and if l'm going to expand, -

333
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,553
- should l expand with guys who got
taken, or the one who took them?

334
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,716
- What's in it for me?
- Money. $5,000 a week.

335
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,280
- Does that include a blow job?
- Watch your mouth, he'll plug you.

336
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,830
He can't. He needs me.
Ain't you been listening?

337
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,437
You're too busy learning lines from
those fairy acting jobs you do. Ten.

338
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,275
Okay, but l want the $42,000 you
stole back by seven o'clock tonight.

339
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,519
l put up my life and my liberty
on that fucking score.

340
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,832
20. l wouldn't kick back
the whole 42 for my mother.

341
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,993
A penny less, we've got no deal.

342
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:34,709
- Krupa and a bullfighter?
- lt ain't exactly confidential.

343
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,908
Krupa l know about ...
and a couple of bullfighters.

344
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,353
- A couple of bullfighters?
- That's what l've heard.

345
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,149
She is who she is.
What man ever changed a woman?

346
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,950
l don't go by what other men have
done. l believe in fresh starts.

347
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,518
Without them you and me would have
been history before we were 1 9.

348
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,752
l hope you like scampi
served on a bed of soft brown rice.

349
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,277
Rimmed by carrots and peas.

350
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,109
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

351
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,074
Come on, eat.
lt'll make you big and strong.

352
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,392
What do you think of bullfighting?

353
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,272
- lt's a while since l tried it.
- What are your memories?

354
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,275
- Dangerous ... and fun.
- What about drums?

355
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,588
- What about drums? l'm a singer.
- You ever sing with a drummer?

356
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,511
l've sung with all kinds of
musicians. Your dinner's going cold.

357
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,949
Did you think l was a virgin?

358
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:08,075
l just thought maybe there
was somebody you hadn't fucked.

359
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,630
That's not pleasant.

360
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,954
Listen, we've both fucked around.
You want to trade stories, fine.

361
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,319
We can also put the past behind us,
but don't play sulky little games.

362
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,600
lf what we share isn't good enough,
then we should call it quits now.

363
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,436
- What'll it be?
- How about iodine?

364
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,151
You need soap and water. And wash
out your mouth, too. l'm going home.

365
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,359
Wait. Come here.

366
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,436
Let go of me.
l'm not staying here.

367
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,960
Get your hands off me, damn it!

368
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,513
Get off me.
l'm never coming back.

369
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,832
Benny.

370
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,512
- You okay?
- l'm fine.

371
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,911
- 42,000 on the nose.
- Thank you very much.

372
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,277
This is Virginia Hill.
Mickey Cohen.

373
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,558
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
l've heard a lot about you.

374
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,429
- Can l come in?
- Could l take a rain check?

375
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,434
Not under the circumstances.
What happened to your head?

376
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,031
A vicious insect.
l'll see you in the morning.

377
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,997
Hey, gumba, kiss my tukus!

378
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,270
Fucking Jew prick.

379
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,639
- Did you ever meet Jack Dragna?
- No.

380
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,830
l've got to speak to him alone.
Wait for me, please.

381
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,118
ln there.

382
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,473
- The cocksucker dished it back.
- Every cent.

383
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,992
l'll be a son of a bitch.
How did you get him to go along?

384
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,756
He brought me the money
and l gave him a job.

385
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,832
He'll be running my operation.

386
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,309
- That's my job.
- No, you work for him now.

387
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,589
- l'm missing something.
- Yeah, about $ 1 4,000 and change.

388
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,390
The 1 4,000 you stole from us,
after the 42 that Mickey took.

389
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,680
- Wait a minute ...
- Do you want to fuck me?

390
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:51,394
- Of course not.
- You're sure? Do you wanna rape me?

391
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,519
- This is crazy.
- Answer me. Do not lie to me.

392
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,832
You stole from me.
Stealing is a form of rape.

393
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,278
Did you think you could get away
with stealing from me?

394
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,433
From Meyer Lansky,
Charlie Luciano and me?

395
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,593
That you could rape us
and humiliate us?

396
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,799
Did you think you could
get away with that? Don't lie!

397
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,599
Do not lie to me!

398
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,998
So you raped us even though
you thought we would catch you?

399
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:30,030
- lt wasn't like that.
- What was it like? Answer me!

400
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,749
Did you think
you could get away with it or not?

401
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,993
- Did you?
- l won't ever do it again.

402
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,109
You won't do it again.
How do you know l won't kill you?

403
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,949
l'm begging you, Ben. Don't.

404
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,908
Do you want to kill me?
You want another chance?

405
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:57,349
l'll tell you something: You can't.
No one can. l can't kill me.

406
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,355
See. Now, try it.
Come on, give it to me.

407
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,153
What is it? Are you afraid to die?
Crawl.

408
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,440
Now, bark like the dog that you wish
you were decent enough to be.

409
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,230
Bark! Crawl and bark.

410
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,833
More, let me hear that bark.

411
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,150
Yes, that's good. More!

412
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,313
Oink like the treacherous,
devious pig that you are.

413
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,910
Come on, get around there.

414
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,868
Oink now!

415
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,757
Get up!

416
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,870
Now look me in the eye.

417
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,391
Go home, get the money you stole
and bring it to me.

418
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:13,558
- This goes back in the safe.
- Thanks, you can count on me.

419
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,431
We'll see. Everybody needs
a fresh start once in a while.

420
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,195
Get out.

421
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,434
Are we going to eat?

422
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,356
Who was the Countess Di Frasso?

423
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:52,719
Who is she? She's the wife
of Count Di Frasso.

424
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,510
- l danced with her at Ciro's.
- l know you danced with her.

425
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:04,950
The countess's husband, the count,
is a very good friend of Mussolini.

426
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,591
- He's Mussolini's friend.
- l got it. So what?

427
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:17,198
Hitler and Mussolini are destroying
the world. l can stop Mussolini.

428
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:24,078
What do you mean?
Kill Mussolini?

429
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,518
You are going to kill Mussolini
in the middle of a war?

430
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,195
That is the most ludicrous excuse
l've ever heard.

431
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,115
lf you want to fuck some countess,
at least have the guts to say it.

432
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,877
- l'm hatching a secret plan.
- You're full of secrets.

433
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,112
- Nothing's out in the open.
- Like what?

434
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,671
Me.
You're afraid of being seen with me.

435
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,719
You told me you don't
keep any secrets from Esta.

436
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,830
- That's different.
- l don't want to be a secret.

437
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,959
- Give me a chance.
- You've had your chance.

438
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,193
- We never go anywhere.
- All right, we'll go everywhere.

439
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:15,230
Give me a chance. Everybody
deserves a fresh start once in a while.

440
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,671
- Come on, sugar.
- l can't. You don't understand.

441
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:35,278
l can't ...
l'm really much too nervous.

442
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,637
- Come on.
- l thought l could, but l can't.

443
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,828
- You can't what?
- Now l've seen the plane, l can't.

444
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,436
l never have ... been on a plane.

445
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,879
- You haven't? One second ...
- l can't control what you do.

446
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,995
l can't be with you every second.
Go without me.

447
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:03,593
- We're gonna run out of gas.
- The rules of aerodynamics ...

448
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,839
lt makes no difference.
l'm not going on the plane.

449
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,757
Ben, let's go.

450
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,070
Time is money.

451
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:40,996
- This is boring. l have to pee.
- lf we'd flown, we'd be there now.

452
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:46,678
- l don't even know why l came.
- Why did l come?

453
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,118
You can't run an operation
in Nevada and never go there.

454
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,352
We drove five and a half hours
for this canker sore?

455
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,753
There's a steady profit
coming out of this joint.

456
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,992
Customers have nowhere else to go.

457
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,278
This is a dump.
You should get rid of it.

458
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,600
- The upkeep is almost zero.
- Who'd have thought it?

459
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:48,394
- Looks don't matter, money does.
- Looks matter. lt should be burnt.

460
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:54,835
- l wouldn't go that far, Victoria.
- What? Call her Virginia.

461
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,198
- l called her Virginia.
- You called me Victoria.

462
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:05,151
- l called you Victoria?
- lt's Virginia. Who do l talk to?

463
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:07,520
l have no need
to hear what you have to say.

464
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,717
l have no need
to hear what you have to say.

465
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,715
- Who took whose advice?
- Don't embarrass me like that.

466
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,475
- l was right.
- The place should have stayed open.

467
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,918
- Why did you close it?
- Because it was a canker sore.

468
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:29,478
- But l'm not your fucking puppet.
- You need to be told what to do.

469
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,156
Or maybe you want to continue
dodging your way through two lives.

470
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,472
Checking at home in Scarsdale
whenever you get too lonely.

471
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,790
Or maybe you're getting old.

472
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,239
That's it. l've taken enough shit
from you, and it's gonna stop now.

473
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,234
- Hot air in a hot desert.
- lt's gonna stop right now.

474
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,077
Don't talk to me about Scarsdale,
it's none of your business.

475
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,992
Talking to me about Scarsdale ...
Who the fuck do you think you are?

476
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,951
- What is he doing?
- Looking for a place to pee.

477
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,831
l got it! l had this vision.
Like a religious epiphany.

478
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,279
- Are you talking about God?
- lt's the best idea l ever had.

479
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,718
Yeah, well l just had
the greatest idea l ever had.

480
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,195
- lsn't she magnificent?
- Just what l've been looking for.

481
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,273
A broad to leave me in the desert,
to die and be eaten by vultures.

482
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,795
You'll remember this day.

483
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,551
Benjy, what would we do in ltaly
with all the bullets flying around?

484
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,038
What we would do?
We would meet Mussolini.

485
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,550
You are outrageous.
That's what l love about you.

486
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,953
<i>- Why do you want to meet the Duce?
- My friends could use his help.</i>

487
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:20,593
Could your husband arrange that,
or is his reputation exaggerated?

488
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,712
My husband could get you this close
to Mussolini any time he wishes.

489
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,635
And he will wish to do
whatever l say.

490
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,436
You know what my intuition
tells me about you?

491
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,269
That you always get
whatever you want.

492
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,955
Don't deny it.
l find your confidence irresistible.

493
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:53,235
l'm sucked in by it. Helpless,
if you must know the truth.

494
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:12,389
We have a few wrinkles to iron out,
but my secret plan is going through.

495
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,712
l'm going to New York tomorrow,
so this is hello and goodbye.

496
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,077
l've got some problems in New York.

497
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:26,155
Charlie's been arrested.
Harry Greenberg, my old friend ...

498
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:31,792
- l think he testified against him.
- Am l supposed to be interested?

499
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,191
What does your friend do,
sticks knives into animals?

500
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:40,070
He's the guitarist.
Flamenco-Flamingo.

501
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,755
You're not actually going
to spend the night with this creep?

502
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,191
What l do with my time and my body
is my business.

503
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,193
l demand satisfaction.

504
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:57,038
Go back to your countess.
l hope she gives you syphilis.

505
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,358
- l'm asking Esta for a divorce.
- You'd better get to a phone.

506
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,439
- Good luck.
- Virginia ...

507
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,833
l was wearing a blue silk shirt?
l don't even own one.

508
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,875
''Brandishing a .45 menacingly.''

509
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,397
What an outrageous fabrication.
lt wasn't a .45, it was a .38.

510
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:26,395
l was not brandishing it.
l was concealing it subtly.

511
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,518
What kind of people write this?

512
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:34,430
l agree with you 1 00%.
They've got no morals, those people.

513
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:43,670
What we heard is true. Charlie's in
jail because of this stool-pigeon.

514
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,232
You know this Harry Greenberg?
You don't?

515
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,709
l know him.

516
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:59,352
Mickey, l'm getting a divorce.
That's why l'm making this trip.

517
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,276
- Definitely?
- Definitely.

518
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,996
- l'm sorry to hear that.
- Why?

519
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:20,235
To see a family break up like that.
What's got to be has got to be.

520
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,276
- l know what you're doing.
- Don't come one step closer.

521
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,836
You're writing ''Happy Birthday,
Millicent'' on my cake.

522
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,788
Get out of here ...
Set the table.

523
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,074
- Where are the presents?
- With the potatoes.

524
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,875
Honey, move the thing in the middle.

525
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,069
- l hope we're not disturbing you?
- lt's Millicent's birthday party.

526
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,792
- There's a matter we must discuss.
- Good, come on in.

527
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:23,231
Make yourselves at home.
l'll be right with you.

528
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,238
Guess who that is. Meyer, Joey A.,
Frank, Gus, Vito and Moe.

529
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,520
- This night was for ourselves.
- l planned a meet tomorrow, but ...

530
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:41,199
- lt's Millicent's birthday.
- They've got a business problem.

531
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:46,434
Finish the cake, put the candles on,
l'll be right back.

532
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:53,353
l have to tell you l got rid of
that seedy canker sore in Vegas.

533
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,115
You had no right
to give that casino up.

534
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,796
- Casino? lt was an outhouse.
- You should have consulted us.

535
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:06,636
- That's the arrangement we've got.
- l have no arrangement with you.

536
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,753
But don't worry, l'll tell you
what l'm to build in its place.

537
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,552
You'll understand for the first time
what the word transcendent means.

538
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:23,114
Meyer ... l have found the answer
to the dreams of America.

539
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,756
You want to be
a little more specific?

540
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,229
The Flamingo.

541
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:35,999
- People dream about sex and money.
- Are you building a whorehouse?

542
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,188
A hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.
A place where gambling is allowed.

543
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,916
The whole territory is wide open.
A palace, an oasis, a city.

544
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:51,950
When the Hoover Dam is finished,
electrical power will be available.

545
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:56,113
The Hoover Dam and fucking
are connected how?

546
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,158
Air-conditioning.
The wave of the future.

547
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,472
Every room will be 72 degrees
at all times.

548
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,154
We'll put Monte Carlo to shame.

549
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:10,273
Wall-to-wall carpeting,
ltalian marble, stables.

550
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,113
A train from L.A. to Vegas.

551
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,193
Planes back and forth.
We'll have our own airport!

552
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,319
lt's a good place to trap people in
to take their money.

553
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,996
- ls that what you're getting at?
- Much more.

554
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,993
l've got to get that.

555
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,879
l got it!

556
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:37,028
Mickey, have you got someone
across the street?

557
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,028
Call Warner Brothers, call Ciro's.
Call me if anybody's seen her.

558
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,590
No, not five minutes. One minute.

559
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,313
Sit tight, honey.
Let me just see how they're doing.

560
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,951
Oh, that looks great.
Your mother's a real artist.

561
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,152
l've got these guys going
on this thing.

562
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,472
The children don't have the patience
that some adults do.

563
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,832
You finish the candles in here
and l'll finish up out there.

564
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,754
Don't move, birthday girl.

565
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:21,756
l don't understand this desert idea.
Let's concentrate on Cuba.

566
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,118
There's legalized gambling next to
Florida. lt's like another state.

567
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,354
lt's not another state. A foreign
country can always throw you out.

568
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,672
<i>Nevada is another state
and it's open.</i>

569
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:41,517
lf we follow the hotel with schools,
and churches and synagogues, -

570
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,470
- we'll be in charge before
you know it ... of the whole state!

571
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,958
- We'll have a stake in the country.
- You planning to run for president?

572
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:57,992
We can help to choose the president
if we control a state.

573
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,039
Where do you think the money
for this is going to come from?

574
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,830
l'll be working for the partners,
so the money should come from them.

575
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,595
- Them meaning you.
- How much are we talking about?

576
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,788
- One million dollars.
- What about the publicity?

577
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,190
Ben's famous in California.

578
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:23,309
Famous is good for Clark Gable,
but for you it's not good.

579
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,278
Our gambling will be legitimate.

580
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:30,228
Meyer, we've known each other
since we were too young to fuck.

581
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:36,191
When did l ever ask you to leap
ahead with something on faith?

582
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:40,478
Never, but l'm asking you now.
Do this.

583
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:51,232
You've got 65 guys on the payroll
and nobody can find Virginia?

584
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:57,678
l cannot function effectively
when l'm in a state of ignorance.

585
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,871
Find her.
