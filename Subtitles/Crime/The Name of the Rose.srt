discovered the body...

to avert suspicion falling on him.

on the translator's desk.

last night and read it.

by some agonizing pain...

And, in fact, I am wearing them now
on my nose as I write these lines.

02:07:15,085 --> 02:07:20,798
Then he embraced me fondly,
like a father, and sent me on my way.

1209
02:07:20,966 --> 02:07:24,510
I never saw him again and know not
what became of him...

1210
02:07:24,678 --> 02:07:28,348
...but I pray always that God
received his soul and forgave...

1211
02:07:28,515 --> 02:07:33,853
...the many little vanities to which
he was driven by his intellectual pride.

1212
02:07:34,355 --> 02:07:39,275
And yet, now that I am
an old, old man...

1213
02:07:39,443 --> 02:07:44,322
...I must confess that of all the faces
that appear to me out of the past...

1214
02:07:44,490 --> 02:07:48,076
...the one I see most clearly
is that of the girl...

1215
02:07:48,243 --> 02:07:54,707
...of whom I've never ceased to dream
these many long years.

1216
02:07:54,875 --> 02:07:58,586
She was the only earthly love
of my life...

1217
02:07:58,879 --> 02:08:03,549
...yet I never knew
nor ever learned her name.
