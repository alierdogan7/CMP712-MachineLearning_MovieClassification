00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,127
- Why?
- I was just curious.

354
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,366
My momma tried to kill me
when I was real little.

355
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,646
She put a pillow over my face,

356
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,371
because she cared more about herself
than her little baby.

357
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,683
She didn't love me like a momma
should love a little baby.

358
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,081
And she was happy,
because she thought she'd done it.

359
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,447
And then I couldn't grow into
something better than she'd been.

361
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,441
She hadn't done it.
She didn't send me back to Him.

362
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,762
She just made me sick.
Made me not be for a while.

maybe you could tell us the questions

-we need to ask.
- It's pretty simple.

that I'm going to perform.

I won't give you many details
on my activities,

the better for everyone involved.

Now I only have a couple of rules
that I insist on sticking to.

394

- Insist.
- CHRIS: Okay. Yeah.

Yeah.

That's not our problem.

We have a problem with the advance.

- No exceptions.
- Sir, let me explain.

417
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,121
One of the reasons
we're interested in having this done

418
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,682
is my mother holds
a very large insurance policy.

419
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,727
They usually do.

420
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,928
Now we thought
if we can guarantee payment

421
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,082
after the policy has been covered...

422
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,084

for discussion.

'Cause I'm his wife, like he said.

1216
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,326
Did you advise Ansel
against the idea?

1217
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,366
No.

1218
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,487
Why?

1219
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,770
You could have told him
Chris would fuck it up.

1220
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,407
It's none of my business.

1221
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,323
But it is, isn't it?

1222
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:17,449
I mean, it is your business.

1223
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,730
What are you getting at?

1224
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,086
If you were going to
share in the money,

1225
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,686
then it is your business, isn't it?

1226
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,481
Yeah, I don't know.

1227
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,531
Yet you did not advise Ansel,
your husband, against it.

1228
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,967
Look, I wanted some of that money,
all right?

1229
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,611
If Chris could pull this off
then I...

1230
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,444
Were you gonna split Ansel's share

1231
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,524
or were the four of you
gonna split it evenly?

1232
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,204
- We didn't discuss that.
- I'm sure you did.

1233
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,682

(SIGHS)

1235
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,326
Well, I assumed
that I would take a fourth.

1236
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,488
JOE: Not one-half of one-third.

1237
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,769
SHARLA: No, a fourth, four ways.
JOE: Instead of one-sixths.

1238
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,571
One-sixths.

1239
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,884
No. Four ways.

1240
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,962
So the remainder of the money

1241
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,203
would be split evenly
after I'd been paid my fee.

1242
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,808
-$25,000.
- Right, right. Right.

1243
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,805
- Yeah, right after you were covered.
- Which means equal shares.

1244
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,563
What would those four equal shares
come out to?

1245
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,241
- I haven't done the math.
- Well, then do it with me. Right now.

any of that money!

1253
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,200
Ah. Mmm.

1254
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,806
- So Ansel gets the cheque.
- Dottie.

1255
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,247
- Dottie.
- Look, if the cheque is for 100,

- How much?
-25.

1260

-50 thousand.
- That much.

01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,646
-50 minus your 25.
- Right, minus my 25,

1262
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,285
but you said 100, didn't you?

1263
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,885
Yeah, however much, minus your money.

No, but you said 100.

And I deserve my payment in full.

1393
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,882
Because of a misunderstanding
with the insurance,

1394

I won't receive any cash
for my services.

1405

We're leaving here.

1562
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,091
We should let Dottie decide.

1563
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,730
Dottie doesn't have
a say in the matter.

1564
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,241
- Oh, I believe she does.
- You believe wrong.

1565
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,402
Dottie, go get your stuff.

She's my retainer.

1577
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,683
Deal's off.
You're gonna have to eat this one.

1578
