I've done some work for him.

351
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,340
We have to find out where he stands.

352

I want you to wait for me here.

00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,530
- Sure.
- I won't be long. You'll be all right?

happened. How you holding up?

Sorry to make you wait so long, Mike.
Come on in.

I'd like to work for you.

372
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,890
Well, that's very interesting.

373
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:47,650
And in return, I'd like you to turn a
blind eye to what I have to do.

374
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,500
And what is that?

375

Is one more body
gonna make a difference?

377
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,900
This is a good proposal, Mr. Nitti.

378
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,730
I will work only for you,
and you know I can do a good job.

379

you come work for us. But not like this.

383

Let me explain something to you that
maybe you haven't realized.

384
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,220
All these years, you've been living
under the protection...

385

...of people who care about you.

386
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:40,810
And those same people
are protecting you now, including me.

387
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,820
So if you go ahead with this,
if you open that door...

388
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,050
...you're walking through it alone.

389
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,970
And all that Ioyalty, all that trust,
will no longer exist for you.

390
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:02,970
And Mike, you won't make it.
Not on your own.

391
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,740
And not with a little boy.

392
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,330
You're protecting him already?

to see you.

395
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:28,580
I appreciate that.
Now I suggest you drive yourself back.

396
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,410
Go home, Mike.
Go home and bury your wife and child.

01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:27,140
Me too.

700
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:34,930
So, what do you like?

701
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,620
Huh?

702
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:42,380
What subjects do you like...?
Did you like in school?

703
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,980
Bible history, maybe.

704
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:49,900
Why?

705
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,890
I like the stories.

706
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:57,620
Peter was good at math.

707
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:02,380
Was he?

708
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,380
Did you like Peter more than me?

709
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,300
No.

710
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:22,610
No, Michael.

711
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,860
I loved you both the same.

712
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:30,530
But you were...

713
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,100
You were different with me.

714
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:37,740
Was I?

715
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:50,180
Well...

716
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:56,420
Maybe it was because Peter was just
such a sweet boy, you know?

717
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,810
And you...

718
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,380
You were more like me.

719
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:13,860
And I didn't want you to be.

720
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,620
I didn't mean to be...

721
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:22,780
...different.

722
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:28,580
Okay.

723
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,700
Good night, Pa.

Good night.

Get your things.

726
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,100
We're leaving.

727
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:58,780
We left you something.

You're a smart man, Michael.

731
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:22,460
I wanna talk.

732
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:24,810
Here?

733
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:26,980
Downstairs.

734
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:56,060
I didn't think I'd see you again.

Read this.

736
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:03,860
Connor's been stealing from you
for years.

737
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:09,420
He keeps accounts open under the names
of dead men. Men like the McGoverns.

738
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,620
I stood there and helped him
kill Finn to line his own pockets.

739
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:18,410
I thought I was working for you,
but I wasn't.

740
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,460
You think I'd give up my son?

741
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,580
He was betraying you.

742
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:25,180
I know.

743
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,220
Now, listen to me.

744
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:31,380
I tried to avoid more bloodshed.
You wouldn't accept that...

745
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:35,580
...so I did what was necessary.
But I've always loved you like a son.

746
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:40,180
And now I'm telling you,
leave before it's too late.

Think.

748
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,300
Think.

749
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:48,740
They're protecting him now, but when
you're gone, they won't need him.

750
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:53,100
- This ends with Connor dead regardless.
- That may be...

751
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,380
...but you are asking me...

752
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:59,900
...to give you the key to his room
so you can walk in...

753
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:03,420
...put a gun to his head
and pull the trigger. I can't do that.

754
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:08,130
- He murdered Annie and Peter.
- There are only murderers in this room.

755
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,530
Michael, open your eyes.

756
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:15,580
This is the life we chose,
the life we lead.

And there is only one guarantee:
None of us will see heaven.

758
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:24,260
Michael could.

759
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:30,290
Then do everything that you can
to see that that happens.

760
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:33,900
Leave.
I'm begging you.

761
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,730
It's the only way.

762
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,940
And if I go?

763
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:44,140
Then...

764
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,980
...I will mourn...

765
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:49,860

Just one last thing,
and then it's done.

769
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,260
Go back to bed, Michael.

that my father's only fear...

...was that his son
would follow the same road.
