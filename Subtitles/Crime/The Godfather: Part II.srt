1
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,229
Mr Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,

2
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,750
you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

3
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,473
That's right.

4
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,233
But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organisation.

5
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,073
No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.

6
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,635
What was your position?

7
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,158
At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.

8
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,477
- What is that?
- A button, you know, Senator.

9
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,830
No, I don't know. Tell me.

10
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,479
When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?

11
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,954
Mr Questadt.

12
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,836
You mean you kill people?

13
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,670
You kill people at the...
behest of your superiors.

14
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,639
Yeah, that's right.

15
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,119
And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?

16
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,073
Yeah, Counsellor. Michael Corleone.

17
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,512
Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?

18
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,676
No, I never talked to him.

19
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,475
Mr Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?

20
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,831
- Do what?
- Could you expand on your answer?

21
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,750
I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?

22
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,837
Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.

23
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,272
Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!

24
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,189
You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.

25
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,389
Tell me something, Ma.

26
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,119
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

27
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,519
He was being strong...

28
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,914
Strong for his family.

29
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,832
But by being strong for his family...

30
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,070
...could he...

31
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,039
...Iose it?

32
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,277
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

33
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,399
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

34
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,597
No, I meant...Iose his family.

35
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,869
But you can never lose your family.

36
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,910
Times are changing.

37
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,190
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

38
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,630
Take it as a gift.

39
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,079
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

40
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,279
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

41
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,677
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

42
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,269
She's in bad trouble.

43
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,190
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

44
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,434
He told her to get rid of the animal.

45
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,157
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

46
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,319
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

47
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,311
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

48
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,150
I'm so ashamed!

49
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,309
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

50
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,996
I'm sorry, but...

51
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,519
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

52
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,233
I can't move!

53
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,550
I want you to talk to him!

54
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,911
Tell him I want to stay here!

55
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,470
What's your landlord's name?

56
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,955
His name is Signor Roberto.

57
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,350
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

58
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,675
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

59
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,314
A real pig-sty, eh?

60
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,509
My name is vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

61
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,917
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

62
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,398
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

63
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,639
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

64
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,833
I already rented the place
to another family.

65
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,434
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

66
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,273
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

67
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,232
So let her stay.

68
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,715
Impossible.

69
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,989
Are you Sicilian?

70
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,475
No, I'm Calabrese.

71
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,752
We're practically paesani,
do me this favor.

72
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,276
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

73
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,359
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

74
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,154
How much more a month?

75
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,670
Five bucks.

76
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,593
Here's six months increase in advance.

77
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,713
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

78
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,878
Come see me in another six months.

79
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,276
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

80
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,879
The dog stays.

81
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,435
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

82
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,431
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

83
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,676
Do me this favor.

84
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,510
I won't forget it.

85
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,199
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

86
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,473
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

87
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,594
What a character!

88
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,916
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

89
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,039
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

90
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,678
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don vito.

91
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,915
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

92
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,475
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

93
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,470
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

94
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,717
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

95
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,832
Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!

96
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,911
Because after all, Don vito,
money isn't everything.

97
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,270
Can I sit down?

98
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,956
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

99
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,830
The rent stays like before!

100
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,796
I'll even lower it.

101
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,994
I'll lower it $5.

102
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,953
I'll lower it $1 0!

103
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,229
Can I offer you some coffee?

104
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,395
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

105
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,719
You'll have to excuse me for now.

106
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,233
I wish I could stay longer!

107
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,757
Just call me and I'll be here!

108
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,077
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

109
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,469
- vito, what do you think?
- We'll make a big business!

110
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,559
Would you speak up, please?

111
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,034
New York City.

112
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,596
- Are you the son of vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.

113
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,270
- Where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.

114
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,112
Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?

115
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,790
Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.

116
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,918
Mr Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness' statement.

117
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,989
For years many of my constituents
have been of ltalian descent.

118
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,156
I've come to know them well.

119
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,111
They have honoured me
with their support and their friendship.

120
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,269
I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are ltalian-Americans.

121
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,790
However, Mr Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings,

122
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,676
in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.

123
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,838
Before I leave, I do want to say this,

124
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,999
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever

125
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,760
a slur upon the great ltalian people.

126
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,952
I can state from my own knowledge
and experience

127
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,870
that ltalian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,

128
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,198
patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.

129
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,076
It would be a shame, Mr Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples

130
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,430
to give a bad name to the whole barrel.

131
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,794
Because from the time of Christopher
Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi,

132
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,956
to the present day,

133
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,233
Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation.

134
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,669
They are the salt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.

135
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,069
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

136
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,159
Mr Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.

137
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,310
We have testimony from
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.

138
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,513
He stated that you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in the country.

139
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,070
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

140
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,750
He testified that you are personally
responsible

141
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,191
for the murder of a New York
police captain in 1 947,

142
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,836
and with him a man
named virgil Sollozzo.

143
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,395
- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.

144
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,512
Is it true that in the year 1 950

145
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,794
you devised the murder of the heads
of the "Five Families" in New York,

146
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,276
to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?

147
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,517
- It's a complete falsehood.
- Mr Questadt.

148
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,191
Is it true you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las vegas?

149
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,229
No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hotels there, but very little.

150
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,799
I also have stock in lBM and lT&T.

151
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,758
Do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in New York State?

152
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,473
No, I do not.

153
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,831
Senator, my client would like to
read a statement.

154
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,353
Mr Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.

155
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,112
Sir, my client has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.

156
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,917
He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement should be heard!

157
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,550
No, I'll allow Mr Corleone to read
his statement. I'll put it in the record.

158
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,318
In the hopes of clearing
my family name,

159
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,195
to give my children their share
of the American way of life

160
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,358
without a blemish on their name
and background,

161
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,509
I have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation.

162
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,919
I consider it a great personal dishonour
to have to deny that I am a criminal.

163
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,157
I wish to have the following noted
for the record:

164
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,194
That I served my country faithfully
in World War Two

165
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,349
and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defence of my country.

166
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,153
That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.

167
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,148
That no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy,

168
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,797
whether it is called Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name,

169
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,195
has ever been made public.

170
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,349
I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth
Amendment, although I may do so.

171
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,433
I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me,

172
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,078
and if they do not, I hope they will have
the decency to clear my name

173
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,750
with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it.

174
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,479
I'm sure we're impressed. Particularly
with your love for our country.

175
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,274
We'll be in recess until 1 0 a.m. Monday,

176
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,996
when we will produce a witness who'll
corroborate the charges against you.

177
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,115
At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.

178
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,598
I remind you that you're still
under subpoena. Adjourned!

179
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,436
Ten-to-one shot, you said.
He would take the Fifth, and I'd lose.

180
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,077
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

181
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,317
- Well, just get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah.

182
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,556
You've got a big day tomorrow.

183
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,196
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

184
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,037
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

185
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,199
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

186
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,349
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

187
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,596
Come on! I saw this 1 9 times.

188
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,275
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

189
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,438
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

190
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,077
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

191
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,033
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

192
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,879
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

193
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,230
Some deal!

194
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,435
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

195
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,188
- How did they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

196
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,278
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.

197
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,438
He thought you double-crossed him.

198
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,837
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared,

199
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,600
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

200
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,749
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

201
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,958
The FBl has him airtight. He's on
an army base, 24 hour guards.

202
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,910
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

203
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,038
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

204
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,710
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

205
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,993
Roth, he... played this one beautifully.

206
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,679
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

207
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,920
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

208
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,835
We have time.

209
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,998
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

210
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,073
I didn't know all that much.

211
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,876
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

212
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,073
Anything you can tell me now?

213
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,994
They've got Pentangeli.

214
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,635
I didn't know it was going to be
a hit, Mike.

215
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,990
I swear to God I didn't know.

216
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,838
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

217
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,518
He said that he wanted to talk.

218
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,950
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

219
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,433
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

220
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,269
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations,

221
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,632
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast...

222
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,589
...it would be good for the family.

223
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,398
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

224
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,275
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

225
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,429
- I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
- Taken care of me?!

226
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,309
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

227
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,957
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

228
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,319
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

229
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,278
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."

230
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,199
"Let Fredo fetch somebody at the airport!"

231
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,478
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

232
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,832
- It's the way Pop wanted it.
- It's not the way I wanted it!

233
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,670
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

234
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,589
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

235
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,909
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

236
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,397
The senate lawyer, Questadt...
He belongs to Roth.

237
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,358
Fredo...

238
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,148
...you're nothing to me now.

239
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,349
Not a brother, not a friend.

240
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,998
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

241
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,838
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

242
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,474
I don't want you near my house.

243
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,837
When you see our mother, I want to
know in advance, so I won't be there.

244
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,675
You understand?

245
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,191
Mikey.

246
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,838
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

247
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,430
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

248
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,599
- Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
- Frankie Five-Angels...

249
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,594
This committee will come to order!

250
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,913
- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.

251
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,635
- Where were you born?
- Pontenegro, it's outside of Palermo.

252
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,796
Where do you live now?

253
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,949
I live in an army barracks
with the FBl guys.

254
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,198
We have here a witness
that will further testify

255
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,475
to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal
empire that controls all gambling.

256
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,550
This witness has had no buffer between
himself and Michael Corleone.

257
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,513
He can corroborate enough charges

258
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,157
for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against Michael Corleone.

259
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,191
- Senator.
- Thank you, Chairman.

260
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,833
Mr Pentangeli...

261
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,593
Mr Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

262
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,351
Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,

263
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,917
and under vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?

264
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,028
I never knew any Godfather.

265
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,511
I have my own family.

266
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,229
Mr Pentangeli, you...

267
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,353
You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.

268
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,836
I ask you again, sir, here and now
under oath,

269
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,751
were you at any time a member of a crime
organisation led by Michael Corleone?

270
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,313
I don't know nothing about that!

271
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,789
I was in the olive oil business
with his father,

272
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,514
but that was a long time ago.

273
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,511
We have a sworn affidavit.

274
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,352
Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.

275
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,031
Do you deny this confession, and do
you realise what will happen if you do?

276
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,232
The FBl guys promised me a deal,

277
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,878
so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.

278
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,834
But it was all lies. Everything!

279
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,676
They kept saying,

280
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,670
"Michael Corleone did this"
and "Michael Corleone did that".

281
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,788
So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"

282
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,518
Mr Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentleman sitting to your left?

283
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,110
I can answer that.

284
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,278
His name is vincenzo Pentangeli.

285
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,598
- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.

286
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,471
- Will he come forward and be sworn?
- He doesn't understand English.

287
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,195
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

288
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,710
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

289
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,310
- He knows nothing about this?
- To my knowledge, nothing.

290
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,270
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.

291
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,471
- The witness is excused.
- Senator!

292
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,990
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

293
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,314
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

294
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,308
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hello, darling.

295
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,070
The children are outside. We're going.

296
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,914
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

297
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,035
Rocco?

298
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,514
I'll be in my room, Mike.

299
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,158
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

300
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,636
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

301
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,909
I'm very happy for you.

302
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,398
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

303
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,197
- Why don't you sit down?
- No, I'm not going to stay long.

304
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,949
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

305
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,950
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

306
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,038
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

307
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,671
- I wasn't going to say anything...
- What do you mean, "too late"?

308
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,394
What really happened with Pentangeli?

309
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,949
- His brother came and helped him.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.

310
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,958
Where is he now?

311
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,674
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

312
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,749
All he had to do was show his face.

313
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,996
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

314
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,269
Don't tell me you're going.
Not you, not the kids. No.

315
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,148
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.

316
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,069
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

317
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,795
Things between men and women
will not change.

318
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,709
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

319
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,835
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

320
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,077
- Anthony is not fine!
- I don't want to hear about it.

321
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,989
- Anthony is...
- I don't want to hear about it!

322
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,236
Over!

323
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,759
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

324
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,075
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

325
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,836
Kay...

326
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,636
We're leaving tomorrow.

327
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,352
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

328
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,112
- Michael, you haven't heard me.
- Kay, what do you want from me?

329
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,395
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

330
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,433
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

331
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,349
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

332
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,430
Don't you know that?

333
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,832
Kay...

334
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,031
In time, you'll feel differently.

335
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,353
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

336
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,237
I know that.

337
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,311
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

338
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,633
Yes.

339
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,954
I know what that meant to you.

340
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,633
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

341
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,559
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

342
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,234
I'm going to change.

343
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,193
I'll change. I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

344
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,958
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage...

345
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,430
...and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and l.

346
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,719
- We'll go on.
- Oh, Michael!

347
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,070
Michael, you are blind.

348
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,155
It wasn't a miscarriage.

349
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,833
It was an abortion.

350
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,549
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

351
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,316
Something that's unholy and evil!

352
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,873
I didn't want your son, Michael!

353
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,358
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

354
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,155
It was an abortion, Michael.

355
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,793
It was a son - and I had it killed
because this must all end!

356
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,234
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

357
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,674
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

358
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,351
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

359
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,791
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

360
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,152
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

361
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,396
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

362
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,439
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

363
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,638
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

364
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,798
My partner in America, in New York.

365
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,275
His name is vito Corleone.

366
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,119
We'll send him olive oil from here.

367
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,197
To his company in America.

368
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,758
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

369
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,279
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

370
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,753
Where is this young man
from New York?

371
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,236
Have him come closer.

372
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,956
I can't see him so good.

373
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,198
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

374
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,116
Bless you!

375
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,353
What's your name?

376
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,511
You took the name of this town!

377
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,517
And what's your father's name?

378
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,235
His name was...Antonio Andolini.

379
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,319
Louder, I don't hear so good.

380
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,511
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

381
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,393
...and this is for you!

382
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,108
Michael, say goodbye.

383
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,030
Hi, Al.

384
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,553
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

385
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,873
Tom, where's Mike?

386
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,833
Waiting for you to leave.

387
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,672
- Can I talk with him?
- Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

388
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,397
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

389
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,275
Michael, it's Connie.

390
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,711
Michael...

391
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,995
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

392
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,108
Is Kay coming?

393
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,158
No.

394
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,317
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

395
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,274
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

396
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,352
That's right.

397
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,317
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

398
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,230
Please, I want to talk to you.

399
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,954
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

400
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,474
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know...

401
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,596
...that I could hurt you.

402
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,672
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

403
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,789
And I forgive you.

404
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,233
Can't you forgive Fredo?

405
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,831
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

406
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,549
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

407
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,196
Connie...

408
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,034
Tom, sit down.

409
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,036
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

410
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,677
- Did you hear about it?
- I hear that he's in lsrael.

411
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,631
The High Court in lsrael
turned down his request to live there.

412
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,276
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

413
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,074
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

414
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,751
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

415
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,748
- They turned him down.
- He's going to try Panama.

416
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,557
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

417
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,231
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

418
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,273
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

419
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,439
- That plane goes to Miami.
- That's right. That's where I want it met.

420
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,680
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
lnternal Revenue, Customs and FBl.

421
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,838
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

422
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,592
- There's no way we can get to him!
- Tom, you surprise me.

423
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,876
If anything in this life is certain...

424
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,197
...if history has taught us anything...

425
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,868
...it's that you can kill anyone.

426
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,556
- Rocco?
- Difficult. Not impossible.

427
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,990
Good.

428
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,356
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

429
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,517
I thought you were going to tell me that
you're moving your family to vegas...

430
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,710
...and that you'd been offered the vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

431
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,839
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

432
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,679
- Let's do business.
- All right.

433
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,674
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

434
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,431
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
Are they worth it, are we strong enough?

435
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,591
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

436
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,874
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

437
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,760
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

438
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,999
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress,

439
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,158
and move them all to Las vegas.

440
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,950
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?

441
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,356
So...you're staying?

442
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,156
Yes, I'm staying.

443
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,995
What do you want me to do?

444
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,111
Hey, Anthony...

445
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,991
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

446
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,555
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

447
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,228
You know, when I was your age...

448
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,273
... I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

449
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,750
I was the only one that caught a fish.

450
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,593
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

451
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,755
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

452
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,396
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

453
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,719
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

454
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,389
- Do you want to try it out on the lake?
- Okay.

455
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,352
What else have you got?

456
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,354
Everything will be okay.

457
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,269
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah, don't worry.

458
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,156
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

459
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,237
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

460
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,230
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

461
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,638
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

462
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,797
Tom...

463
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,114
...what do I do now?

464
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,717
Frankie...

465
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,954
You were always interested
in politics and history.

466
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,676
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

467
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,316
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

468
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,999
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organisation of the families,

469
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,399
basing them on the old Roman legions,
with "regimes", "capos" and "soldiers".

470
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,674
- And it worked.
- Yeah, it worked.

471
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,750
Those were the great old days,
you know.

472
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,872
We was like the Roman Empire.

473
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,356
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

474
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,517
Yeah...

475
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,995
...it was once.

476
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,356
Frankie...

477
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,116
When a plot against the Emperor failed...

478
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,676
...the plotters were always
given a chance...

479
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,870
...to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

480
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,036
Only the rich guys.

481
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,995
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

482
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,149
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

483
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,393
And their families were taken care of.

484
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,191
That was a good break, a nice deal.

485
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,239
Yeah.

486
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,116
They went home...

487
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,118
...and sat in a hot bath...

488
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,709
...opened up their veins...

489
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,480
...and bled to death.

490
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,599
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

491
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,195
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

492
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,517
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

493
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,560
- See you, Tom.
- Addio, Frankie.

494
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,598
Kay... You have to go.

495
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,629
- So pretty...
- Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

496
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,595
Anthony... Kiss Mama goodbye.

497
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,799
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

498
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,835
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony... I love you, Anthony.

499
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,235
Kay, please.

500
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,871
All right.

501
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,510
Mary, come here.

502
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,192
Anthony...

503
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,233
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

504
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,356
Easy.

505
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,712
Anthony! Anthony!

506
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,832
- He's here, we're going fishing.
- No!

507
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,474
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

508
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,557
Shit!

509
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,476
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

510
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,394
- I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

511
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,273
Hey, Anthony...

512
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,632
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

513
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,874
Let's go.

514
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,399
- Mr Roth, I must take you into custody.
- I understand.

515
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,558
What's your reaction
to the lsraeli High Court ruling?

516
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,399
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

517
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:31,515
I went to lsrael to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

518
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,796
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

519
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,272
Frankie!

520
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,279
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

521
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,916
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

522
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,476
I came home to vote
in the presidential election,

523
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,911
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

524
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,075
Jesus Christ.

525
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,511
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

526
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,037
Blessed art thou amongst women.

527
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,198
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

528
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,393
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

529
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:36,509
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

530
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,920
- You know my brother Fredo.
- Sure.

531
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,557
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

532
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,832
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.

533
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:52,318
- Say hello to Carlo. He's good-looking?
- Yes.

534
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:56,354
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

535
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,509
Sit down. Talk to each other.

536
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,836
Hey, Mr Einstein...

537
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,435
- The cake.
- Sally, get in here!

538
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,631
- I was scared.
- Come on.

539
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,471
- Where's your father?
- Christmas shopping.

540
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,910
Let's see that thing.

541
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,316
That's nice!

542
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,195
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

543
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,238
- What is that? Rum?
- Yeah.

544
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,197
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

545
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,914
He's not ugly...

546
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,792
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

547
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,470
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

548
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,194
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

549
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,678
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

550
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,316
- 30,000 enlisted this morning.
- Bunch of saps...

551
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,830
- Why are they saps?
- Let's not talk about the war.

552
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,758
You talk to Carlo.

553
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,397
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.

554
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,956
- That's Pop talking.
- You're right, that's Pop talking!

555
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,550
- They risk their lives for their country.
- Country isn't your blood.

556
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:28,437
- I don't feel that way.
- Then quit college and join the army!

557
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,039
I did.

558
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,198
I've enlisted in the Marines.

559
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,391
- Why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

560
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,639
- Pop managed to get you a deferment.
- I didn't ask for it.

561
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,796
I didn't want it.

562
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,795
Come on! Knock it off!

563
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,549
- Punk!
- Sonny, sit down.

564
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,510
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

565
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,354
Go and show Carlo the tree.

566
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,876
Nice.

567
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,470
Nice.

568
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,638
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

569
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,834
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

570
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,076
Don't encourage him!

571
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,840
Get me a drink. Go on!

572
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,756
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

573
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,953
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

574
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,349
You've talked to my father
about my future?

575
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:53,474
- My future.
- Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

576
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:59,073
- I have my own plans for my future.
- Did you go to college to get stupid?

577
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,077
He's here!

578
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,791
Come on.

579
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,831
Stupid!

580
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,670
Surprise!

581
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:36,073
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

582
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,796
That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...
