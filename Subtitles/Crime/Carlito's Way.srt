01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:12,992
l'm sorry.

988
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:22,585
Well, it's just not a simple question.

989
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,214
-l just can't answer it like. . .
-That's all right,

990
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:28,550
-you don't have to. . .
-There it is.

991
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:30,635
You don't have to answer.

992
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:38,184
When l was a kid in East Harlem,

993
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:41,729
the wops said,

994
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:45,608
no spics could go east of Park Avenue.

995
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:51,114
Spooks said
no 'Ricans west of Fifth Avenue.

996
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,450
That don't leave you
much room to maneuver.

997
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:58,663
Say you want to go to Central Park,
play with the ducks. You're shit out of luck.

998
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:01,332
So what do you do? You go anyway.

999
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:05,295
l'm up on 1 06th Street,
Central Park, near the lake.

1000
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:09,966
l get caught by these Copiens. Right?
They surround me.

1001
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:12,927
So l get my blood up, pull out my blade.

1002
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:15,430
l said, "Come on !
l'll take any one of you mothers!"

1003
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:20,310
They say, "No, man. We're gonna kill
your ass." Out comes the zip gun.

1004
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,812
Homemade gun.

1005
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:27,609
You pull the hook back,
catch that bullet square, ping.

1006
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:30,987
Hit you in the head, man,
you got serious problems.

1007
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,948
That was the last chase on me like that

1008
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,035
because from then on
l carried my own piece.

1009
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:42,582
Guys went down, yeah, but it ain't like,
you know, you just

1010
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,877
decide one day, and then that's it. No.

1011
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:51,382
You just do what you gotta do to survive.

1012
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:56,721
Somehow, you know,
you just end up where you are.

1013
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,769
So everybody ends up where they are.

1014
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:04,437
Everybody.

1015
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:09,859
Only l'm gettin' out. l'm gonna rent cars.

1016
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:14,405
What are you laughing at?

1017
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,575
Everybody laughs at that. That's a dream.

1018
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:19,744
l know, l'm sorry.

1019
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:22,080
Didn't you ever have a dream?

1020
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:23,915
Of course l did.

1021
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:29,587
The Diamond Room isn't exactly
the end of my rainbow, you know.

1022
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,005
lt's just. . .

1023
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:34,258
l don't know.

1024
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:42,850
Just sometimes l hear myself talk

1025
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:52,068
about new agents and auditions,
and l'm trying to be so optimistic.

1026
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,366
Then l think,

1027
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,661
"Why should l be so optimistic?"

1028
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,383
Yeah, l had a dream, Charlie

1029
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,804
but now l'm awake.

1030
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,017
And l hate my dream.

1031
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:39,490
Maybe it's time l started thinking
about doing something else.

1032
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,663
Maybe someplace else, too.

You should tell him what you think.
Why hold somethin' like that inside?

Why not get something like that

Sit down !

Come on, everybody.

You're a beautiful woman.

-No, l don't.
-Good.

1090
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:35,810
Just asking 'cause of our little boat trip
tomorrow night.

1091
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,019
Just drop it.

1092
01:28:37,104 --> 01:28:41,273
Just tryin' to cover all the bases.
lt's comin' up, you know.

01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,863
You two going somewhere?

1094
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,492
No big deal. Just a little boat ride.

1095
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:55,496
Why don't you just let it go?
lt's dull what you're doin'.

1096
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,498
-What's the problem?
-lt's just fuckin' dull.

1097
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:00,126
-l'm just askin' a simple question.
-No, you're not.

1098
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,795
-What's the matter?
-You're actin' like an asshole.

1099
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:07,466
lf a guy's goin' on a boat, you wanna know
if he gets seasick. lt could be important.

1100
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:08,968
What boat?

1101
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,724
What boat are you talking about?

1102
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,232
What boat, Charlie?

1103
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:42,710
lf you ever talk that shit again
in front of her, l'm gonna kill you.

1104
01:29:48,467 --> 01:29:50,134
What's the matter with him?

1105
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:54,972
l don't like him.

1106
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:59,560
-l didn't like him the minute l met him.
-You're just not listenin' to me.

1107
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:03,606
All right.

1108
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,276
So what is this boat thing?

1109
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:11,489
What is that asshole manipulating you into?
Tell me.

1110
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:15,076
Just helpin' him out with something,
that's all. l owe him.

1111
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,494
You owe him?

1112
01:30:17,788 --> 01:30:20,206
He's a fucking cokehead !

1113
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,709
l can't believe you hang around
with that guy.

1114
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,045
He's sick.

1115
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:29,507
He's gonna get you killed,
or sent back to prison.

1116
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,509
He saved my life!

1117
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:35,387
So now you have to pay him with it?

1118
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:40,935
Jesus Christ, Charlie,
you give me this whole song and dance

1119
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:44,271
about how you're out of that shit,
but you're not.

1120
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:47,316
Song and dance? What does that mean,
"song and dance"?

1121
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:49,360
You're not.

1122
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:52,530
Where'd you get that? From what?

1123
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,619
-Why did you drag me into this?
-Drag you into what?

1124
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:02,123
Why did you make me believe all the crap
about Bahamas and paradise?

1125
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,043
l feel ridiculous!

1126
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,213
'Cause you haven't changed !

1127
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,757
You haven't changed a bit!

1128
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,682
What the fuck are you tryin' to tell me?

1129
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:24,311
That my gettin' out is just some bullshit,
fantasy trip l'm layin' on you?

1130
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,939
ls that what you're sayin'?
How could you say that?

1131
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:30,234
How can you say that
when you know how close l am?

1132
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:33,863
How could you say those words to me?

1133
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:38,576
l gotta do this, just this one thing,
and then l'm out.

1134
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:41,287
-l owe Dave.
-You don't owe him shit!

1135
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:43,831
You think you do. That's the problem.

1136
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,293
-That's why nobody like you gets out.
-You're not listening.

1137
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:51,088
Everything you learned
in the neighborhood, every instinct

1138
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,632
won't do anything but get you killed !

1139
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:56,886
How do you know what l learned
in my neighborhood?

1140
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,221
This is stupid what you're saying.

1141
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:01,557
l know how this dream ends.

1142
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,685
lt isn't in paradise.

1143
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:11,859
lt ends with me carrying you
into Sutton Emergency Room

1144
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,361
at 3:00 a.m.

1145
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,741
And standing there,

1146
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,577
crying like an idiot

1147
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:27,082
while your shoes fill with blood and you die.

1148
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:31,879
-You won't listen to me. . .
-'Cause you're bullshitting me!

1149
