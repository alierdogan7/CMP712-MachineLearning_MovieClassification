As was I.

Um, I hate to be indelicate,
but Henrik promised me something

1010
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,173
when I agreed to do this.
Yeah, Wennerström.

1011
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,315
I need to know what he has
on him. Now. In case, um...

In case he dies?

1013
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,916
Well, that is indelicate.
And I apologize.

1014
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:48,612
I don't know what he has
on him, if you're asking me.

1015
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:53,090
And he can't tell you
in the condition he's in, so...

1016
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,821
We also didn't discuss
who I'd report to if something
should happen to him.

1017
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,830
Oh, well, you'd report to me,
of course.

1018

going to come of this, don't we?

No. No, we don't know that.

to share your report with me.

The investigator's name.
That is her name, yes?

1034

See, I can't find any record of her,
and I'm pretty good at that.

1035
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:53,915
Would it matter what her name is?
If I wanted to speak to her, yes.

only have come from one place.

1044
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:18,678
The reason you can find
no record of her is because
her records are sealed.

1045
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,339
She's a ward of the state.
What's that gotta do with anything?
