1
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:37,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
TIE ME UP / TIE ME DOWN

2
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:48,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go see the director
when you're finished.

3
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,574  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will do.

4
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come in.

5
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:01,417  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hi.

6
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:05,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Sit down.

7
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The judge...

8
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:12,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
says you're free to leave now.

9
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:16,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He thinks you may join society
as of today.

10
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:18,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Great!

11
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:21,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No need to run away again.

12
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're free, Ricky.

13
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,341  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Freedom...

14
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
also means solitude.

15
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I won't be there to protect you.

16
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:37,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'll have to answer...

17
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for your actions
like any other citizen.

18
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't worry, I'll manage.

19
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are your plans?

20
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:47,536  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get a job, a family,
like any other regular guy.

21
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:49,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're not a regular guy.

22
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:52,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The judge says I am.

23
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What does he know!

24
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:07,053  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There are 50,000 pesetas.

25
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:09,461  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's for the drawings...

26
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:13,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the mad passionate moments
you brought me.

27
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks.
I promise not to spend them.

28
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:19,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't be silly.

29
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:23,475  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'll need money
until you find a job.

30
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:28,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's a list of places
where you can apply.

31
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:31,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now go,
and don't ever come back.

32
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I told you to leave!

33
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:53,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
First let me thank you
for everything.

34
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:19,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Running away, are you?

35
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:21,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The judge's letting me go.

36
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm fit to join society.

37
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:26,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Society...

38
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:29,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I used to belong to society once.

39
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:32,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was a Gourmets' society.

40
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:33,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They tried to poison me.

41
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,609  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd be careful if I were you.

42
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:40,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come here, look.

43
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:43,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here.
It's free.

44
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:49,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it?

45
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:53,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The Society's membership card.

46
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,623  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cards are always handy.

47
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:59,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Any credit cards?
- None left.

48
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,607  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm expecting a delivery.

49
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:03,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, see you.

50
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:56,090  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- How much is that?
- A fiver, honey.

51
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:59,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's a fiver, Mom?
- Five hundred, darling.

52
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hi.

53
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll be right with you.

54
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your change.

55
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:17,447  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good-bye.

56
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:22,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What will it be?
- The heart in the window.

57
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- How much is it?
- Five hundred.

58
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:34,732  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- My bus!
- Don't you want it wrapped?

59
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"Barajas Studios"...

60
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:01,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"Therapeutical shooting.
Marina Osorio."

61
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:14,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina!

62
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:18,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll take off my panties,
they show.

63
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:22,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's worse, showing your panties
or your twat?

64
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Speaking of which...

65
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:27,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I promised Maximo we'd do something
at tonight's party.

66
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,783  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Like what?
- Sexy but simple.

67
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:32,552  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like in the good old times
at the cabaret.

68
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I've forgotten how.
- Bullshit!

69
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:38,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A little tit here,
a little tac there...

70
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:40,633  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll kill two birds with one stone.

71
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Both Maximo and the producer
will be thrilled.

72
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whatever you say, boss.

73
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:47,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina...

74
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I didn't tell you...

75
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,605  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm so proud of you.

76
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:53,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Silly!

77
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:55,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Make it last.

78
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,247  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You lay it on too thick.
- I've got to lay something.

79
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,221  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I better lean on them
if we wanna finish today.

80
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:06,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We could sing that one.

81
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:50,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here's something for you.

82
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cool!

83
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,141  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After my stroke,
half of my body was paralyzed.

84
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:13,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So I thought I'd better hurry...

85
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,019  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and do another film,
before the other half went.

86
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,182  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Certainly.

87
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:20,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here I am,
doing my posthumous work.

88
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:24,127  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But you look so alive
in your own electric chair.

89
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I like that, electric chair...

90
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:28,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Sorry, I meant that--
- But you're right.

91
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Since I've been stuck
in this chair...

92
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I feel hornier than ever.

93
00:11:34,107 --> 00:11:37,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My wife says
I'm regressing into childhood.

94
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,140  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She may be right.

95
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:43,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After a stroke, you gotta learn
everything again...

96
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
how to speak...

97
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:47,777  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to read, to write...

98
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:50,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to dance but, above all...

99
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that you want to keep on living.

100
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Which, in my case,
means making movies.

101
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:56,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What a lovely thing to say!

102
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:59,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The knives...
The fake one.

103
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It doesn't even fool her!
- Sure it does!

104
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It doesn't!
These props stink.

105
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:12,136  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What about the couch?
- Later.

106
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Later, when?
- Later!

107
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,573  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have you seen Marina?

108
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:22,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How would you define
<i>Midnight Phantom?</i>

109
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:25,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, I'd say it's a b-movie.

110
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aren't you worried about making...

111
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
your comeback with a b-movie?

112
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've always wanted to do one.

113
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:33,456  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina!

114
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:36,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But I'm afraid it's turning out
to be rather personal.

115
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:39,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A personal b-movie?
How's that?

116
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:43,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By putting one's heart,
and one's genitals on the line.

117
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You're known as a women's director.
- Genitals remind you of women?

118
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, but why choose...

119
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:53,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a porn actress
who's known to be a junkie?

120
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,692  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you want
to get out of here alive...

121
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
don't mention the words
"porn" and " junkie" again!

122
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:30,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Hi, Maximo.
- Hello.

123
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:34,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Do we start shooting?
- The set isn't ready.

124
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,058  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- How's your toothache?
- Not so good.

125
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They still haven't brought you
an aspirin?

126
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:40,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Carlos!

127
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:45,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait! You'll wreck the set!
Come this way.

128
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Jump! But careful,
you're very fat.

129
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

130
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:56,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I promise not to mention
"porn" and " junkie" again.

131
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,717  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's better.

132
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Who's she?
- A journalist.

133
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Which scene is next?
- My death.

134
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:08,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How will you play dead?

135
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:10,887  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now that you mention it...
What kind of face...

136
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:14,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
do I have when he stabs me
on the couch?

137
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:20,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Osvaldo!

138
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:23,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look! Like her.

139
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,536  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Osvaldo!
- Don't say "Osvaldo."

140
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:30,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't say "Osvaldo."

141
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:36,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like this?

142
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's pissed.

143
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:43,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maximo, what scene do we shoot?

144
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- The one with the phone.
- And then?

145
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:48,730  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is worse than a circus.

146
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How can you concentrate?

147
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:53,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As a kid, I used to work
in a real one.

148
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was a rodeo type of thing.

149
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I had a lasso...

150
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and some supposedly wild horses...

151
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and I'd round them up,
tame them...

152
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:04,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, I am.

153
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:07,008  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did I say?

154
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You tamed, lassoed and jumped...

155
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:12,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And then, I'd line them up,
and walk on top of them...

156
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
striking poses, you know?

157
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,461  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And when I...
- Excuse me.

158
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come and tell me about it.

159
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:23,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I ran around
in a little short skirt...

160
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:25,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and my hair came down to my ass.

161
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:26,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If I had been there...

162
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:33,545  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Osvaldo...
Don't you recognize me?

163
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:37,481  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It's me, Montse.
- Boy! You're changed!

164
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I gained a little weight
since we split.

165
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:45,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You've spread a bit too.
- I sure have!

166
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:48,052  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mind if I interview you?

167
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:51,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You're a journalist now?
- And you're an actor?

168
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:54,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Kids, I gotta speak to you later.

169
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:57,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Okay, what's next?
- Wait...

170
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
something's cooking.

171
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:02,574  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Maximo, we gotta talk.
- Excuse me.

172
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:05,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My boots!

173
00:16:05,878 --> 00:16:09,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The producer's wife likes the couch.
She wants it.

174
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:12,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- So what?
- It might get splattered...

175
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:14,146  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in the final slaughter.

176
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,380  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Very likely.

177
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:18,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's hard stabbing a girl
without spilling blood.

178
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,488  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You better talk to him.
- He doesn't want any blood?

179
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,188  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sure he does, lots.
But not on the couch.

180
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:26,891  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'll change the ending.
- You won't change a thing!

181
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I never liked it.
- You loved it.

182
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:30,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to change it.

183
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You got the new dialogues?
- In a minute.

184
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look, I want you to make your movie.

185
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:39,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why should you compromise just because
her twat's dripping for the couch?

186
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:42,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Forget it, Lola.
I've got a better ending!

187
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:45,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina, you won't die.
I'll save you.

188
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No stabbing?

189
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:50,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shit, I had gotten used to the idea.
So now what?

190
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:52,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can you stand your toothache?

191
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:53,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not really. Why?

192
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It gives you the perfect expression
for the scene.

193
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- As long as it's there...
- Thanks, love!

194
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He'll be the end of my career.

195
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:05,460  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's the nicest director
I've ever had.

196
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:08,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The trouble is,
he'd like to be even nicer.

197
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:10,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And to top it,
you took off your panties!

198
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- So what?
- He sees you...

199
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:15,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
gets inspired,
wants to save you...

200
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:18,108  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and it all gets changed on me!

201
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:38,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's you.

202
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,672  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, I feel much better.

203
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:47,410  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, thank the police on my behalf.

204
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,472  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not today, better tomorrow.

205
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:52,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I need to sleep.

206
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,287  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Darling, I'm afraid
the whole future is ours.

207
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Of course I worship you!

208
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:06,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me about the gruesome details
tomorrow.

209
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,228  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, I worship you.

210
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:11,930  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, love...

211
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:13,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
good-bye.

212
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out of there.

213
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,307  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I knew you'd come.

214
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You knew even though
they told you I had died?

215
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You wouldn't die...

216
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,725  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
without saying good-bye.

217
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not here to say good-bye...

218
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but to take you away with me.

219
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:50,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where to?

220
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:55,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To a very quiet place
where we can be happy.

221
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What?

222
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,616  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
First take off your mask!

223
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:03,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Show me your face!

224
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:07,819  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have no face.

225
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:10,657  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, you have something.

226
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:14,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I may as well get used to it,
if you're taking me away.

227
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you really want to see it?

228
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I do!

229
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:26,733  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't.

230
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:29,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look at my body,
my body is alive...

231
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:35,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but my face...

232
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:38,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
is that of a corpse!

233
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You offer me death,
but death rarely brings happiness.

234
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:08,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cut! That's a wrap.

235
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Go help the actress.
- Hold on!

236
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nobody move!

237
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:17,284  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My walkman and Osvaldo's money
are missing!

238
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:20,025  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- The handcuffs too!
- And several props!

239
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And my 10,000 pesetas!

240
00:20:22,434 --> 00:20:24,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, not that, I took them.

241
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give it back and I promise
there'll be no reprisals.

242
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:29,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm responsible for all this!

243
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:32,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd love to take things too,
but I don't.

244
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:34,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've been divine.

245
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Who took the stuff?
- Relax, Lola...

246
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:39,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the movie's done,
you won't lose your job.

247
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:41,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I guess so.
- Let's celebrate.

248
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Who was it?
- Let's have some champagne.

249
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,254  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, alcohol might loosen
some tongues.

250
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,939  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't stare at me.

251
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:38,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not...

252
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:42,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I admire you.
- Well, don't.

253
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's the hurry?

254
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,982  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm soaked.
What do you want?

255
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, nothing.
You wouldn't like it.

256
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:54,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't tell me then.

257
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,687  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You'll come to the party?
- Sure.

258
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,770  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hi.

259
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:14,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sorry.

260
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can I speak to you for a second?

261
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:18,541  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not now, some other time.

262
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:22,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina! Look! Look!

263
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:23,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look at me!

264
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:26,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look!

265
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:35,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I won't eat them.

266
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:37,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You got keys to my place?
- Of course.

267
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:41,202  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You've lost yours?
- I can't find them.

268
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:44,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Try and use your head.
- See you, Marina.

269
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:47,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By the way, I wish
you'd come to the party.

270
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:51,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't. I don't want to.
I won't discuss it.

271
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,908  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Now what?
- My pay.

272
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:06,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Where's the car?
- Down there.

273
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:10,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

274
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's its name?
- Paquita.

275
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:14,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Like my niece.

276
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,141  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Show me your hoof.

277
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Poor baby! She's got a calk!

278
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:22,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's that?

279
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
An abscess.

280
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Better unshoe her.
- Who'll pull the cart?

281
00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:30,420  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you don't,
gangrene will set in.

282
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:32,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Make a plaster
with bran and vinegar...

283
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:35,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
stick it on sackcloth
and wrap her hoof with it.

284
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:38,661  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Remove it 24 hours later,
and clean it with iodine.

285
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:40,164  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And then, let it dry.

286
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:43,167  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right, Paquita? Tell them
they're taking advantage of you.

287
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:44,725  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I mean it, she could die.

288
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:47,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Thanks a lot, miss.
- Bye, Paquita.

289
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:51,272  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The young lady's right.

290
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:52,901  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
See?

291
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,733  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Filled chocolates.

292
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maximo's too much.

293
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:28,489  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Who is it?
- Pepe, your neighbor.

294
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:31,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hi. Where are you going?

295
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:35,270  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Somewhere far away to forget
that nightmarish film.

296
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well!

297
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give my mail to Lola,
she's got my address.

298
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:41,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Fine.
- Marina...

299
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you were absolutely marvellous.

300
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:47,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Really?
- You bet!

301
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I listened to Maximo
even when I didn't understand him.

302
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:53,716  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'll tell me your secret
when I get back.

303
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- When's that?
- In a couple of weeks.

304
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:58,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Enjoy yourself...

305
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:02,092  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- and screw a lot.
- If I do, I won't come back.

306
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What a one-track mind.

307
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:24,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it, Pepe?

308
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:29,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's up?

309
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:31,052  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Relax!

310
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:33,290  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's going on?

311
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:35,625  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My keys!

312
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,035  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't scream!

313
00:27:53,352 --> 00:27:54,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I warned you!

314
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:01,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I warned her.

315
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I told her not to.

316
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,180  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who are you?

317
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,242  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your attacker.

318
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does it hurt?

319
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:33,348  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Damn!

320
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:35,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out or I'll call the cops!

321
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:39,327  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I didn't mean to hurt you,
but you started screaming.

322
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:40,888  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out!

323
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Man! This looks like a drugstore!

324
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:45,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bastard!

325
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:49,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You broke my tooth!
- I told you I'm sorry.

326
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:52,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I bet you are.

327
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:19,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You wanna fuck me?

328
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get it over with!

329
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:24,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Relax.

330
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:26,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll fuck when the time comes.

331
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:29,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do you want?

332
00:29:31,183 --> 00:29:33,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll tell you...

333
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:36,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but let's lie down on the bed.

334
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:39,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch out for the glass.

335
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I tried to speak to you on the set.
You didn't listen.

336
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:03,741  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I had to kidnap you,
so you'd know me.

337
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:09,144  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sure you'll get to love me
as I love you.

338
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:16,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm 23 years old.

339
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:19,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've got 50,000 pesetas.

340
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:21,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have no one in the whole world.

341
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:25,329  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll try to be a good husband...

342
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:27,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and a good father to your kids.

343
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:50,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're the thief?

344
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:52,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You ignored me.

345
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:54,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You did the handstand.

346
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,497  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, once in a while,
I'm a show-off.

347
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your face looked familiar.

348
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:02,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We met before...

349
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:05,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a year ago,
at a bar called "Lulu."

350
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:07,441  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Remember?

351
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I had run away from the hospital.

352
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:15,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We met at Lulu's...

353
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
came to your place
and we screwed.

354
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:26,820  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I said I'd come back
and protect you.

355
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:28,661  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Many have told me that!

356
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:32,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But I'm here to prove it.
Quit throwing things around!

357
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:44,941  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you like the heart?

358
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not bad, huh?

359
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:18,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I know you understand</i>

360
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:22,484  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>My heart is heavy</i>

361
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:27,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>But when I am at your side</i>

362
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:31,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>My sorrow flies away</i>

363
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:36,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Things will be done your way</i>

364
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:40,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>It is your fault</i>

365
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:45,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>If my soul awaits you</i>

366
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:48,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Awaits you once more</i>

367
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's a sweetie.

368
00:32:51,182 --> 00:32:54,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>How could I ever stand</i>

369
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Living without you?</i>

370
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,025  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>How could I ever wait?</i>

371
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>How could I resist?</i>

372
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:13,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Sadness and despair</i>

373
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:18,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Have overwhelmed me</i>

374
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:23,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Ever since you left</i>

375
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:25,845  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I've forgotten what living means</i>

376
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:58,981  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't get it,
you've taken four pills.

377
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:02,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Painkillers don't work.

378
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why not?

379
00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:07,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was hooked on smack.

380
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:11,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When you're used to heroin,
painkillers don't do shit.

381
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,293  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I had no idea.

382
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:18,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Morphine would help,
or something.

383
00:34:18,503 --> 00:34:19,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Morphine?

384
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:22,006  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where would I find it?

385
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:26,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The doctor who detoxed me
could give us something.

386
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:28,612  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We can't go there.

387
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, God!

388
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:37,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What would you say?
Meet a friend who kidnapped me?

389
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:40,090  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Of course I wouldn't!
- What then?

390
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nothing! I swear it!

391
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:45,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She only lives three blocks away.

392
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:48,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please, I can't stand it.

393
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,858  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't stand it!
I really can't!

394
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:55,632  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Besides, it's your fault!

395
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:01,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right.

396
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:04,007  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you try to fool me...

397
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:07,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I swear I'll do us both in,
got it?

398
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get dressed.

399
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:11,822  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go on.

400
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've got a pretty body.

401
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:43,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't bother,
I hid all the blades.

402
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:49,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Put some make-up
on your bruises.

403
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I like being in the bathroom
with you...

404
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
like a married couple
getting ready to go out.

405
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:07,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina, it's me, Lola.
Get the phone.

406
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:08,602  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're really something!

407
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,046  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I had to sing on my own.</i>

408
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:13,345  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If we hold hands,
the handcuffs won't show.

409
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:16,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>...wondered about you.</i>
<i>I said you had a toothache.</i>

410
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:17,821  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Who is it?
- My sister.

411
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:19,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

412
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:23,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>- ...your old habit...</i>
- Wait.

413
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:26,052  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>If you've done something silly,</i>
<i>don't worry.</i>

414
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>You were doing so well.</i>

415
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:32,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, darling.
See you tomorrow.

416
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:34,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gimme a drink.

417
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:38,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What?
- Let me see, a beer.

418
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:42,006  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I may not like your face,
but your ass is another story.

419
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Maximo, for heaven's sake!
- Gimme a drink, Apache.

420
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:46,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You've had enough.
Forgive him, Lola.

421
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:49,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm drinking too,
and I don't mess with his stroke.

422
00:36:49,354 --> 00:36:50,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want my drink.

423
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:54,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your ass and my stroke
are part of our culture.

424
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:57,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's true.
You were great, Lola.

425
00:36:57,395 --> 00:37:00,626  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Thanks.
- But we miss Marina.

426
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:02,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's keeping her?

427
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,536  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I just talked to her. That rain scene
made her toothache worse.

428
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:10,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He told me all about it,
it must be lovely!

429
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:13,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sure, it's great hanging
under the rain...

430
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:15,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
like <i>A Man Called Horse.</i>

431
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lola, please forgive...

432
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:19,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
my typically alcoholic aggression.

433
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:22,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You're forgiven.
- I can't stand your face...

434
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:25,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but your tits
are something else.

435
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's true.

436
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:31,661  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We shouldn't have come.

437
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:34,226  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't say that.

438
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:37,291  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What if there's someone?
- She lives alone.

439
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:39,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But she could have somebody now.

440
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on! I'll ask her.

441
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:47,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- It's me, Marina.

442
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:48,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Come in.</i>

443
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you alone?

444
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:53,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Like a dog.</i>
<i>Come on up.</i>

445
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:54,408  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right.

446
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:56,419  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How dare you?

447
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:11,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't try anything funny, okay?

448
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:15,303  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it?
You scared me.

449
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:17,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I got a terrible toothache.

450
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:20,134  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What an abscess.
The daddy of them all.

451
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:21,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm glad it's just that.

452
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:24,982  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Hi, I'm Berta.
- Ricky. Glad to meet you.

453
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,983  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on in.

454
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:30,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've taken four Fiorinals, but...

455
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:33,856  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I warned you that the first months...

456
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:35,825  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch the table!
It has a mind of its own.

457
00:38:35,893 --> 00:38:39,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After all you sniffed,
analgesics are useless.

458
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give me something.

459
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me see...

460
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:45,730  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How about Sosegon?

461
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:48,067  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's nothing worse
than a toothache.

462
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:51,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- An earache is pretty bad.
- What about a colic?

463
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:54,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Never had one.
- Well, I have.

464
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:58,247  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen, take it for a couple days,
no more...

465
00:38:58,316 --> 00:38:59,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you can get hooked on this too.

466
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:03,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I know you, you're such a hog.
Isn't she?

467
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:06,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did she hit you?

468
00:39:07,592 --> 00:39:10,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I bumped into something.
- What a pair!

469
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:19,062  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Want a joint?

470
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:22,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- No, thank you.
- No, thanks.

471
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You look real uptight, Marina.

472
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:26,141  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take it easy.

473
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,145  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Why are you so nervous?
- I can't stand it!

474
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:31,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's too much.
Gimme something now.

475
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:33,109  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A shot?

476
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dolantine should help.

477
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:39,714  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, dear!
You're a born dope fiend!

478
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The babies woke up,
I'll go rock them.

479
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Don't, Berta!
- Why?

480
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:58,341  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hang on...

481
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:00,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll go.

482
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't mind?

483
00:40:06,884 --> 00:40:08,977  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's so cute your guy.

484
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:15,253  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You haven't taken anything?
You're acting real weird.

485
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:18,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Show me. It's okay.

486
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You hopheads are so...

487
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:22,095  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What cops?
- Shut up!

488
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:28,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My babies!

489
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:31,099  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why did you pick them up?

490
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:34,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I couldn't help myself.

491
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:35,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My cuties!

492
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:37,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mommy...

493
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:42,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Relax, love, the pain
will go away soon.

494
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ready, Marina?

495
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:48,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's go, Ricky.

496
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:58,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you looking at?
I'm here!

497
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:00,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't fuck around!

498
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:03,133  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Let go of my hand!
- The handcuffs will show!

499
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:05,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's no one around.

500
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:09,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- How can that be?
- Weekend, August, vacation.

501
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:11,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The pain's gone.

502
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:13,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can tell by your face.

503
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Want to buy the medicines anyway?

504
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:19,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gimme your hand and shut up,
all right?

505
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:33,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Someone's ringing.
- Let them!

506
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,301  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hear moans.

507
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:46,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It could be an emergency.

508
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:48,047  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A junkie most likely.

509
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Goddamn motherfuckers!

510
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:58,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Careful.

511
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:01,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"No to rheumatism..."

512
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:05,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ma'am!

513
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:14,535  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What is it?
- We need some Sosegon.

514
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:17,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't have any.

515
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:20,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Lady, this isn't a hold-up.
-Just in case.

516
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:22,410  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've got a legal prescription.

517
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:25,011  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Call the doctor
if you don't trust us.

518
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:27,580  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't have any.
Anything else?

519
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Some tape.

520
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:35,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What for?
- Be quiet.

521
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:44,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can find Sosegon
in the Chueca Square.

522
00:42:44,942 --> 00:42:48,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- The drugstore's open there?
- What drugstore?

523
00:42:48,379 --> 00:42:51,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You buy it off the street.
You can find...

524
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:55,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
all the pills you need
on the black market.

525
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:07,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Wait, there's no rush.
- Don't push your luck.

526
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:11,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What is it?
- I don't wanna go inside.

527
00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:13,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What do you want?
- I want you to let me go.

528
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:15,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Impossible.

529
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:19,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Be sensible.

530
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:22,771  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you want another broken tooth?

531
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,179  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're going home.
Come.

532
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:26,648  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on.

533
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:47,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
C'mon!

534
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:03,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And now what?

535
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:07,050  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll take off your handcuffs,
so you can get comfortable.

536
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:09,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What for?
- I'll go get those pills.

537
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You lie down and wait for me.

538
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:20,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Turn around, I don't want you
to see me naked.

539
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:22,330  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sure, sorry.

540
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:26,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't happen to have some rope...

541
00:44:26,444 --> 00:44:28,173  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or something to hang clothes with?

542
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:29,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What for?

543
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:33,545  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This will do...

544
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:35,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not enough.

545
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:38,687  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A rope, a cord, something?

546
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:40,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What will you do?

547
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:19,952  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Need anything?

548
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:24,061  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you want to write, to chat?

549
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:26,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Play a game?

550
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:31,670  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Call me if you need me.
- Okay.

551
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:43,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Years ago, when a bullfighter
got top honors...

552
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:46,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
his fans would carry him home.

553
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:48,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They'd wait until he came out
on the balcony...

554
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:51,256  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to offer him a last cheer.

555
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:55,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

556
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:59,501  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I suppose because I'm close
to the balcony...

557
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,471  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and I'd like for you
to be on the street...

558
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and speak to me.

559
00:46:04,942 --> 00:46:06,341  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina...

560
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,344  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's me, Maximo.

561
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:13,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I don't know if you have</i>
<i>a toothache or what.</i>

562
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,580  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>You don't want to answer?</i>
<i>Fine.</i>

563
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:20,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>But if you're running away from me,</i>
<i>tell me why.</i>

564
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Anyway...</i>

565
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:25,860  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>give me a ring tomorrow.</i>

566
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I'll be either at home</i>
<i>or editing. Bye.</i>

567
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:47,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My moustache will fall off.

568
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:55,386  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You got Sosegon?
- No, but I got hash and scag.

569
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:57,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The chick on the bike
covers pills.

570
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:04,661  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thanks.

571
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:08,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You! The one on the bike!

572
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:10,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Got any Sosegon?

573
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:13,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't shout, asshole!

574
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:15,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cool it.

575
00:47:15,112 --> 00:47:16,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I just asked if you had any.

576
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:19,847  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- How many do you want?
- Don't know, a few...

577
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:21,612  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My girl's got a toothache.

578
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:23,846  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You got any dough?

579
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,352  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here's more.

580
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:30,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait for me in the square,
I'll be right back.

581
00:47:49,146 --> 00:47:52,980  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I told you to wait.
- Now that I'm here, gimme the pills.

582
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- How many?
- Gimme all you've got.

583
00:47:56,554 --> 00:47:58,419  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you doing?

584
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:00,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bastard!

585
00:48:03,494 --> 00:48:05,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What've you got there?
- What do you think?

586
00:48:05,863 --> 00:48:07,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you show your face again,
I'll kill you!

587
00:48:20,477 --> 00:48:21,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's me!

588
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:43,459  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look what I brought you.

589
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:47,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I bet you'll like it.

590
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's out cold.

591
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:52,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right.

592
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll untie you...

593
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:57,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
just so you don't think I enjoy...

594
00:48:58,048 --> 00:49:00,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
making you suffer.

595
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:02,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's see...here...

596
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,045  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's gonna wake up.

597
00:49:07,491 --> 00:49:10,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wake up, don't wake up, wake up...

598
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:23,731  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Careful not to touch her pussy...

599
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:25,570  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's it!
Don't wake up...

600
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:27,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't wake up.

601
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The gag...

602
00:49:35,019 --> 00:49:37,920  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Better leave it on,
she's got some mouth.

603
00:49:38,422 --> 00:49:40,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well...

604
00:49:40,224 --> 00:49:42,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
let's rest a little.

605
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What a night.

606
00:49:55,306 --> 00:49:59,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The nights I've dreamt
of lying here with you!

607
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:10,419  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Christ! What a hard-on!

608
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:19,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll jerk off.

609
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:23,262  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Kind of embarrassing
with her here though.

610
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:27,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nah, I'd better sleep.

611
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:15,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's up?

612
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:21,082  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The pain's back.

613
00:52:21,151 --> 00:52:25,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And you thought maybe
the keys would help, right?

614
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, I took the stuff you brought.

615
00:52:28,325 --> 00:52:31,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is that how you thank me?

616
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:33,190  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You dumb shit!

617
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:37,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can't you see it's a trick?
That I was testing you?

618
00:52:47,311 --> 00:52:51,008  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How long before
you fall in love with me?

619
00:52:51,081 --> 00:52:55,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When will you see
no one's gonna love you like I do?

620
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:19,974  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Poor thing.

621
00:53:20,043 --> 00:53:23,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's more a love story
than a horror story.

622
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's hard to tell them apart.

623
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:27,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We got a blockbuster.

624
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:29,916  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's wrong, Lola?
- Nothing.

625
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:31,921  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You look worried.
- I got a hangover.

626
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:34,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Have a Bloody Mary.
- That's all I need.

627
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:36,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Order one for me,
I need it.

628
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'll order it.
- One for me too.

629
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:41,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay. Anything else?
I'm off.

630
00:53:41,899 --> 00:53:43,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The mag stock.

631
00:53:43,901 --> 00:53:45,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ask Marina to call me.

632
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:48,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What for?
- I need to speak to her.

633
00:53:48,272 --> 00:53:50,331  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm on my way to her place.

634
00:53:50,407 --> 00:53:52,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Want me to come?
- No, better not.

635
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:55,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have her call me.

636
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:56,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I miss her.

637
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll tell her.

638
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:41,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The washer's worn out.

639
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay.

640
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:54,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Breakfast.
What are you doing?

641
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:00,175  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hang on, wait.

642
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:02,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Sorry.
- I gotta piss.

643
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:06,674  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All you have to do
is tell me.

644
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,685  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And if you're gagged,
raise your hand.

645
00:55:12,756 --> 00:55:15,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you like the drawing I've made?

646
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:36,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Turn off the tap!

647
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was trying to help.

648
00:55:39,816 --> 00:55:42,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Listen to me.
- What?

649
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:45,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll never love you!

650
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:46,883  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ever!

651
00:55:50,227 --> 00:55:53,060  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't say that yet.

652
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:55,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll never love you!

653
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:57,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Clown!

654
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who asked you to take care of me?

655
00:56:01,271 --> 00:56:04,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To protect me?

656
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:06,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To be my husband
and father to my kids?

657
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:08,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who did?

658
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:11,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And your 50,000 pesetas?

659
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:14,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Keep them!
Spend them on someone else!

660
00:56:19,423 --> 00:56:20,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bitch!

661
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:42,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does it hurt?

662
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:47,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll go out and get
some antibiotics...

663
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and a washer.

664
00:56:49,786 --> 00:56:51,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A washer?

665
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:54,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, for the kitchen tap.

666
00:56:56,093 --> 00:56:57,685  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have...

667
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to tie you up a little.

668
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,892  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lie down, please.

669
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,137  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please.

670
00:57:11,408 --> 00:57:13,308  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sit up, please.

671
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I don't like tying you up.
- Well, don't do it.

672
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:20,812  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shut up!

673
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:26,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Want anything?
- Some other tape.

674
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:29,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This one's skinning me alive.

675
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:36,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm very upset.

676
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:42,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Think a little.
I know you got problems...

677
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but try and put yourself
in my place.

678
00:57:47,644 --> 00:57:50,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How would you feel
after what you told me?

679
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:53,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After all I did for you.

680
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:58,016  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've been mistreated,
but never that badly.

681
00:58:04,127 --> 00:58:05,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anyway...

682
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:08,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
can't you try...

683
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:12,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to be a little less selfish...

684
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:15,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and think a little about others?

685
00:58:18,508 --> 00:58:22,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nobody had ever called me a clown!

686
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:27,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"I'll never love you, ever..."

687
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:30,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, we'll see.

688
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:57,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's busy.

689
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:14,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll deal with you later.

690
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:55,236  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina! Are you there?

691
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:58,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's me, Lola.
Marina, please!

692
01:00:36,379 --> 01:00:38,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Paper ones, extra-porous ones
for sweaty people...

693
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:41,540  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
anti-allergic ones,
silk ones for parties...

694
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:45,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What is it for?
- You know, for the face.

695
01:00:45,622 --> 01:00:48,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This one with holes
sells pretty well.

696
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:53,487  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Is it for your scratch?
- No, it's for a girl.

697
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:55,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This one's soft.

698
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:59,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It's fine. I'll take it.
- Anything else?

699
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:02,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah...some antibiotics
for a bad tooth.

700
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:04,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
An infection?

701
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:50,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"Marina, how can you disappear
without a word?"

702
01:02:50,146 --> 01:02:52,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I'm so worried.</i>

703
01:02:52,982 --> 01:02:55,780  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>If this goes on,</i>
<i>I'll have to call the cops.</i>

704
01:02:55,852 --> 01:02:57,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>We wouldn't want that.</i>

705
01:02:57,687 --> 01:03:00,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I don't care what it is,</i>
<i>we can always solve it.</i>

706
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:02,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>You're what counts.</i>

707
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:05,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Don't be a fool, call me.</i>

708
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:08,059  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Don't try and fix it</i>
<i>on your own.</i>

709
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:11,567  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I'll share any cold turkey with you.</i>

710
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:14,034  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>But say something, darling. Lola.</i>

711
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:27,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've got a surprise.

712
01:03:28,885 --> 01:03:33,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll take the gag off later,
first the surprise.

713
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:49,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Relax, it's a nice surprise.

714
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:21,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Well, how do you like it?
- I've been here before.

715
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:30,709  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Careful.

716
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,213  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's it.

717
01:04:33,316 --> 01:04:36,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aren't you scared
someone will find us?

718
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:40,088  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's why we moved,
who'd look for us here?

719
01:04:41,057 --> 01:04:43,685  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ricky, I'm not as lonely as you.

720
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have a job, a family.

721
01:04:45,595 --> 01:04:49,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sooner or later,
they'll look for me.

722
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:55,929  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll leave soon then.

723
01:04:57,207 --> 01:04:59,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your sister came.

724
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:03,101  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I didn't want to tell you,
but we almost met.

725
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:09,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I know!

726
01:05:09,619 --> 01:05:13,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Call her and tell her
you've gone with friends.

727
01:05:13,656 --> 01:05:17,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That way, she'll stop worrying.

728
01:05:17,126 --> 01:05:19,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You mean it?
I can call her?

729
01:05:19,996 --> 01:05:22,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just to calm her.

730
01:05:25,134 --> 01:05:27,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you try something...

731
01:05:29,272 --> 01:05:31,172  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll slit your throat.

732
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:33,266  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And then my own.

733
01:05:33,977 --> 01:05:35,410  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina...

734
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:37,139  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I got nothing...

735
01:05:37,213 --> 01:05:39,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
so I lose nothing.

736
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:43,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't touch it!

737
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:46,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't mess with the pepper!

738
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:52,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give it here.

739
01:05:52,962 --> 01:05:55,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Stop it!
<i>- Mom?</i>

740
01:05:55,365 --> 01:05:58,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It's me, Marina.
<i>- Hi, Marina. How are you?</i>

741
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:02,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
-Just fine, and you?
- So so...

742
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:05,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Goddamn it! Let me be!
<i>- What is it?</i>

743
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:08,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your niece wants to know
who I'm speaking to.

744
01:06:09,045 --> 01:06:11,775  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mom, tell Lola I'm not in Madrid.

745
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:13,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll tell her.

746
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:17,019  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've gone to the country
to rest a little.

747
01:06:17,086 --> 01:06:19,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>- Good idea.</i>
- What's for lunch?

748
01:06:19,922 --> 01:06:21,287  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop it!

749
01:06:21,357 --> 01:06:23,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What a brat!

750
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:28,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll sure be glad when her mother
comes back and takes her away.

751
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:29,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anyway, there's "pisto."

752
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:31,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
"Pisto."

753
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:34,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It smells good.
- But I can't come.

754
01:06:35,038 --> 01:06:36,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't worry.

755
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:40,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll put some in the fridge
for when you come back.

756
01:06:40,877 --> 01:06:44,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't have a phone here,
but I'll call you.

757
01:06:44,247 --> 01:06:46,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll be waiting.

758
01:06:46,149 --> 01:06:48,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to hear from you.

759
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:51,620  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>- Don't you forget me.</i>
- I won't, Mom.

760
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:54,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Mom...
<i>- What?</i>

761
01:06:55,825 --> 01:06:58,623  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I love you a lot.
<i>- Me too.</i>

762
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:01,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>- Take care of yourself.</i>
- I will, Mom.

763
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:04,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>-A big kiss.</i>
- Bye, Mom.

764
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:21,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Why do retired Germans dance</i>
<i>in Benidorm...</i>

765
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:26,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>while the poor Spanish retirees...</i>

767
01:07:33,663 --> 01:07:35,221  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Because German retirees...</i>

768
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:38,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>think about their future</i>
<i>when still young...</i>

769

<i>while Spaniards...</i>

<i>Spaniards...</i>

773
01:08:17,607 --> 01:08:18,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Next.

774

<i>The Geribank's Retirement Plan...</i>

776
01:08:28,117 --> 01:08:31,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are your plans for the future?

777
01:08:31,788 --> 01:08:34,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll get married
and have two or three kids.

778
01:08:34,657 --> 01:08:38,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Two or three kids?
- Or more, if need be.

779
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:44,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And how will you feed us?

780
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:46,628  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll find a job.

781
01:08:46,702 --> 01:08:50,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll go to Australia,
they need people there.

782
01:08:50,773 --> 01:08:53,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But first,
we'll go to my hometown...

783
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:55,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I haven't been back
since I was three.

784
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Does it still hurt?
- Yeah, kind of.

785
01:09:01,818 --> 01:09:03,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can I help?

786
01:09:04,954 --> 01:09:06,478  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know.

787
01:09:06,556 --> 01:09:08,751  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe some horse...

788
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:12,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It would kill the pain?
- I'm positive.

789
01:09:14,697 --> 01:09:17,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'll go get some.
- Thanks.

790
01:09:29,745 --> 01:09:31,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can you help me?

791
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:35,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't you mind
if I see you naked?

792
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:44,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can manage.

793
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:54,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A comfortable knot...

794
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:58,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Not too tight, please.
- This rope's the best.

795
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:01,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So's the tape.
I tested it when buying it.

796
01:10:03,145 --> 01:10:05,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
See you later.

797
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:08,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Want it open?

798
01:10:15,024 --> 01:10:17,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can watch the stars
while you wait.

799
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:37,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Man, I think he's pretty worried...

800
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:40,505  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
about calling the elections.

801
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm worried too, man,
I got plenty of problems.

802
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:47,111  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, but if he ain't worried...

803
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:48,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
then we ain't got nothing
to worry about.

804
01:10:48,824 --> 01:10:51,019  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You believe that crap?
- Yeah.

805
01:10:51,093 --> 01:10:55,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hell, man, I'm working my ass
like a slave.

806
01:10:55,965 --> 01:10:58,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- But if he wins the elections...
- Got any smack?

807
01:10:59,035 --> 01:11:02,368  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, but how much do you want?

808
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:05,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Don't know, the minimum?
- A 5,000 pesetas bag?

809
01:11:05,341 --> 01:11:08,071  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- All right.
- Wait here...

810
01:11:08,144 --> 01:11:10,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll go get it.

811
01:11:25,895 --> 01:11:28,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll be over there.

812
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:40,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wanna bang me for 5,000 pesetas?

813
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:42,407  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What d'you mean?
I won't pay 5,000...

814
01:11:42,478 --> 01:11:47,040  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- 4,000, in case of herpes.
- It's not the money.

815
01:11:47,116 --> 01:11:50,051  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
if I had to pay every time, hell!

816
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:53,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My girl's got a toothache,
she's waiting for me.

817
01:11:53,756 --> 01:11:55,781  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So what?

818
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:59,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's the one who attacked me.

819
01:11:59,629 --> 01:12:03,121  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- The one with the moustache?
- Maybe he shaved.

820
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,291  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait here.

821
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:07,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You're crazy!
- Maybe, but I ain't paying.

822
01:12:07,637 --> 01:12:10,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- So, we meet again?
- Do I know you?

823
01:12:10,606 --> 01:12:13,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't you?
You roughed me up last night!

824
01:12:17,246 --> 01:12:18,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After him!

825
01:13:19,842 --> 01:13:21,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I told you I'd kill you.

826
01:13:23,612 --> 01:13:26,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What did you find?
- Subway tickets.

827
01:13:26,716 --> 01:13:29,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- 5,000 pesetas.
- Toothpicks. Gimme the dough.

828
01:13:29,685 --> 01:13:32,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Nah. We split it.
- Like hell! He robbed me.

829
01:13:32,088 --> 01:13:34,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, you don't.

830
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:37,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take his coat or screw him.

831
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:39,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I prefer his boots.
- Sold!

832
01:13:39,862 --> 01:13:41,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Gimme the dough.
- What about me?

833
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:44,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You had your fun, sadist.
- That's true.

834
01:14:38,053 --> 01:14:40,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What happened?

835
01:14:40,422 --> 01:14:42,947  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I got attacked and robbed.

836
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,390  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Even your boots!

837
01:14:46,462 --> 01:14:50,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- But why?
- I couldn't get your stuff.

838
01:14:50,766 --> 01:14:53,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't, I'll do it myself.

839
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:11,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me help you.

840
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:31,864  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Those animals!

841
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:47,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- That reminds me of my parents.
- What does?

842
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:52,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My Mom used to shave my Dad
on the porch back home.

843
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:55,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's all I remember.

844
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:17,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Does it hurt?
- Not at all.

845
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:33,331  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Boy, what it's taken!

846
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:43,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know where to put my hands.

847
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:44,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait, wait.

848
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Listen...
- What?

849
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:49,076  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Should we do it?

850
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:52,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- We can stop.
- No, no way.

851
01:16:54,123 --> 01:16:57,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The only thing the bastards
didn't touch was my cock.

852
01:16:57,192 --> 01:16:59,183  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll put it inside.

853
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:58,216  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't pull out.

854
01:18:02,191 --> 01:18:05,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Now I know.
- What?

855
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:07,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I remember you.

856
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:10,864  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't get it.

857
01:18:10,933 --> 01:18:14,096  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When you kidnapped me,
you said we had done it.

858
01:18:14,169 --> 01:18:16,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I said I didn't remember.

859
01:18:16,372 --> 01:18:18,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, now I remember all right.

860
01:18:18,874 --> 01:18:20,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's more like it.

861
01:18:26,015 --> 01:18:27,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Let's move up.
- Where?

862
01:18:27,282 --> 01:18:28,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Up.
- Up?

863
01:18:28,684 --> 01:18:31,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't move. Stay inside.

864
01:18:33,756 --> 01:18:36,748  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Does it hurt?
- I don't know.

865
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:37,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait.

866
01:18:40,295 --> 01:18:42,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't move.

867
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:48,933  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't come.

868
01:18:56,545 --> 01:18:59,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Don't come.
- I'm not!

869
01:19:00,015 --> 01:19:02,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't laugh, it'll slip out.

870
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:16,623  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait, don't move.
Stay inside.

871
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:19,200  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't pull out.

872
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:43,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I didn't want to wake you.
- What's that?

873
01:19:43,759 --> 01:19:45,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A map of my life.

874
01:19:45,828 --> 01:19:46,760  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Show me.

875
01:19:46,829 --> 01:19:48,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look.

876
01:19:48,797 --> 01:19:51,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just imagine
my life's a subway line.

877
01:19:53,469 --> 01:19:56,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
First stop:
orphaned at three years old.

878
01:19:57,072 --> 01:19:58,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Orphanage.

879
01:19:58,707 --> 01:20:02,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I escaped when I was eight.
Reformatory. More escapes.

880
01:20:02,811 --> 01:20:06,941  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Mental hospital at sixteen.
- What a career!

881
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:09,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There, I get on well,
and learn lots of trades.

882
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:12,578  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Locksmith's the best,
breaking in and out.

883
01:20:12,654 --> 01:20:15,680  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So I ran away every so often,
but I always came back.

884
01:20:15,757 --> 01:20:16,849  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why?

885
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:20,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I had nowhere to go.
The director, she liked me.

886
01:20:20,896 --> 01:20:23,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's why you're such a good lay.

887
01:20:24,066 --> 01:20:25,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
With them, it was different.

888
01:20:25,601 --> 01:20:30,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Were there many directors?
- No, but lots of nurses.

889
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now I understand.

890
01:20:33,142 --> 01:20:34,507  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go on.

891
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I escaped a year ago
and met you.

892
01:20:39,581 --> 01:20:42,141  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That stop changed my life.

893
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:44,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All I thought about was you.

894
01:20:44,353 --> 01:20:48,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thinking took up all my time,
and I stopped acting crazy.

895
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:52,290  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The judge came over,
gave me a test...

896
01:20:52,361 --> 01:20:53,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and said I was normal.

897
01:20:53,929 --> 01:20:56,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They let me go.

898
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:58,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
End of the line.

899
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:02,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You.
- Me.

900
01:21:12,981 --> 01:21:15,142  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't leave her hanging there.

901
01:21:15,984 --> 01:21:17,576  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I need another scene...

902
01:21:17,653 --> 01:21:19,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or two.

903
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:23,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Someone find Marina.

904
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:25,917  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If it's a question of money,
I'll pay for it.

905
01:21:25,994 --> 01:21:28,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- With what?
- Money's not the problem, Maximo...

906
01:21:28,497 --> 01:21:31,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but everything has a limit.

907
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Perfection's my only limit.

908
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:38,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do I have to remind you
of your duty as a director?

909
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My duty is to warn you
the film has no ending.

910
01:21:42,477 --> 01:21:44,138  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just add "The End."

911
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:47,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I won't discuss it.

912
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:49,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're going too far!

913
01:21:49,785 --> 01:21:51,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll be in the bar,
meet me there.

914
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay. Can someone grab the mags?
Thanks, love!

915
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:57,250  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's with your sister?
Why doesn't she phone?

916
01:21:57,326 --> 01:21:59,351  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't know!
I'll go see what he wants.

917
01:21:59,428 --> 01:22:02,886  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, hurry, he might not hire you
for his next film.

918
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:06,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you're doing it,
I'd rather direct traffic!

919
01:22:06,435 --> 01:22:08,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Enough, Maximo.

920
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:13,299  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's he got against me?
- It's not you.

921
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:15,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He doesn't want
to finish the film...

922
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:17,611  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
because he knows
it's his last one.

923
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I know he's unbearable...
- I'll say.

924
01:22:20,449 --> 01:22:22,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- He's fighting death.
- Yes, but...

925
01:22:22,884 --> 01:22:26,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can't you tell Marina
to call him?

926
01:22:26,455 --> 01:22:28,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Marina's disappeared.
- What do you mean?

927
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:32,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I haven't seen her since the last day
of shooting. Nobody knows where she is.

928
01:22:32,227 --> 01:22:35,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You two talked that night.
- I lied to you.

929
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:37,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Have you called the police?
- Well, no.

930
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:40,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You see, the police...
Well, I prefer not to.

931
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:41,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I see.

932
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:54,307  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Move. Set the table.

933
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:02,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look.

934
01:23:03,925 --> 01:23:06,291  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here's Granadilla, my hometown.

935
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:08,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not far from Plasencia.

936
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,221  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll steal a car tonight.

937
01:23:10,299 --> 01:23:12,324  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not with that face,
you won't!

938
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:14,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I got balls.
You don't wanna go?

939
01:23:14,836 --> 01:23:17,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not in a stolen car,
I don't.

940
01:23:17,139 --> 01:23:20,597  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll take a bus,
but we're going.

941
01:23:24,613 --> 01:23:27,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The pain's gone, right?

942
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:31,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- My whole body hurts.
- We'll leave tomorrow.

943
01:23:47,803 --> 01:23:48,929  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's your door.

944
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You knew it! That's why
you didn't want to leave!

945
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:45,292  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I swear I didn't!
- You tricked me, you whore!

946
01:24:46,695 --> 01:24:49,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't hit me!
How could I know she had the keys?

947
01:24:49,431 --> 01:24:53,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You talked to Pepe!
You could have guessed it!

948
01:24:55,704 --> 01:24:58,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Don't hurt Lola!
- Shut up!

949
01:25:09,785 --> 01:25:12,151  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll be right down!

950
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,245  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Move your ass, lady!

951
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:16,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I heard you!

952
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:30,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's gone.

953
01:25:43,885 --> 01:25:45,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No need to shout like that!

954
01:25:45,554 --> 01:25:47,419  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I just went up to...
- C'mon, lady!

955
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:49,821  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't push me,
or I'll stay double-parked!

956
01:25:49,891 --> 01:25:53,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Like hell you will!
- Watch your language!

957
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take your damn hands off my car!

958
01:25:56,364 --> 01:25:58,025  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'm gonna burn it!
- You are?

959
01:25:58,099 --> 01:26:02,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Maybe I'll burn you!
- Women!

960
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:05,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I won't say what I think,
else I'd be saying it too macho!

961
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:21,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've got to go,
we can't wait any longer.

962
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:24,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Whatever you say.
- I'll go get a car.

963
01:26:24,626 --> 01:26:27,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I've got a little money.
- We'll need it...

964
01:26:27,696 --> 01:26:29,459  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but we also need a car.

965
01:26:29,531 --> 01:26:30,691  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay.

966
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:34,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you wait for me here...

967
01:26:34,803 --> 01:26:37,772  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or will you run away?

968
01:26:37,839 --> 01:26:39,067  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know.

969
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:41,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Better tie me.

970
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:48,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tie me up!

971
01:27:17,512 --> 01:27:19,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This will be the last time.

972
01:28:16,838 --> 01:28:20,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shit! I forgot the damn radio!

973
01:28:56,111 --> 01:28:57,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here it is.

974
01:28:58,847 --> 01:29:00,678  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm wetting my pants.

975
01:29:22,003 --> 01:29:23,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Weird...

976
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:52,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pepe? Is that you?

977
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:56,659  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come in.

978
01:30:00,341 --> 01:30:02,366  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What happened?
- I got kidnapped.

979
01:30:02,444 --> 01:30:04,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Untie me.

980
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:07,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Kidnapped? But where?
- Here and at home.

981
01:30:07,716 --> 01:30:08,740  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who did it?

982
01:30:08,817 --> 01:30:11,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Later.
He'll be back any minute.

983
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:14,383  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The kidnapper?
Let's go!

984
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:16,890  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You look awful.
Did you take any dope?

985
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:18,858  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll get my purse.

986
01:30:18,927 --> 01:30:20,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What about all this blood?

987
01:30:20,895 --> 01:30:23,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm responsible for all of this.

988
01:30:34,676 --> 01:30:35,802  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My walkman!

989
01:30:35,877 --> 01:30:38,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Leave it,
I'll buy you another one.

990
01:30:40,115 --> 01:30:43,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't get it.
What is it, Marina?

991
01:30:43,785 --> 01:30:46,481  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I love him.
- What?

992
01:30:46,554 --> 01:30:49,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I love him.
- The man who kidnapped you?

993
01:30:49,758 --> 01:30:51,225  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're crazy! Let's go!

994
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:54,159  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How can you love someone
who ties you up?

995
01:30:54,229 --> 01:30:56,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you think that's normal?

996
01:30:56,364 --> 01:31:00,061  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's probably the shock,
no one's that warped.

997
01:31:00,135 --> 01:31:04,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll go to the roof
and into the other building.

998
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:05,428  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
C'mon!

999
01:31:44,712 --> 01:31:46,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hurry!

1000
01:32:15,877 --> 01:32:17,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hurry up, get inside!

1001
01:32:23,685 --> 01:32:25,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>The line from Granadilla to Marina...</i>

1002
01:32:35,697 --> 01:32:37,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How do you feel?

1003
01:32:37,699 --> 01:32:39,064  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fine.

1004
01:32:39,133 --> 01:32:42,102  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I brought you
a sleeping pill. Here.

1005
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:44,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Thanks, Lola.
- All right...

1006
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:47,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
tell me all about it.

1007
01:32:48,943 --> 01:32:51,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't you trust your sis?

1008
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:57,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It isn't easy to explain.
- How did it happen?

1009
01:32:58,219 --> 01:33:00,687  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The night of the party...

1010
01:33:00,755 --> 01:33:03,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pepe rang the bell
to say good-bye.

1011
01:33:03,725 --> 01:33:07,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When it rang again,
I thought it was him.

1012
01:33:07,295 --> 01:33:10,753  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You shouldn't have opened.
- Yeah, but I did.

1013
01:33:10,832 --> 01:33:12,697  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I started screaming and he hit me.

1014
01:33:12,767 --> 01:33:14,530  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How terrible!

1015
01:33:14,602 --> 01:33:18,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- He didn't mean it.
- Like hell he didn't!

1016
01:33:19,407 --> 01:33:22,001  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When I regained consciousness...

1017
01:33:22,076 --> 01:33:24,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he told me
he had kidnapped me...

1018
01:33:24,078 --> 01:33:26,808  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
so I could get to know him well.

1019
01:33:28,116 --> 01:33:32,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He told me he was 23,
and had 50,000 pesetas...

1020
01:33:32,253 --> 01:33:35,222  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that he had no one...

1021
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:37,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and that he'd be a good husband...

1022
01:33:37,992 --> 01:33:40,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and a good father to my kids.

1023
01:33:41,229 --> 01:33:42,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What a mess!

1024
01:34:17,598 --> 01:34:19,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Eleven.

1025
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:24,459  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He can't hear you.
Go on up.

1026
01:35:37,678 --> 01:35:38,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ricky!

1027
01:35:43,718 --> 01:35:44,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina!

1028
01:35:47,688 --> 01:35:49,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You came!

1029
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:53,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
With my sister. She wants us
to live with my family.

1030
01:35:53,394 --> 01:35:56,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Your family?
- And yours from now on.

1031
01:35:58,366 --> 01:35:59,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on.

1032
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:02,292  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's go.

1033
01:36:06,307 --> 01:36:09,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Lola, this is Ricky.
- Hello.

1034
01:36:09,277 --> 01:36:12,440  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Here, this is yours.
- Thanks. Anything else?

1035
01:36:16,017 --> 01:36:17,575  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is that all?

1036
01:36:17,652 --> 01:36:19,449  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hang on.

1037
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'm sorry about all this.
- So am I. Don't let it happen again.

1038
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:25,616  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mind sitting in the back?

1039
01:36:25,693 --> 01:36:27,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What about your car?
- I stole it.

1040
01:36:27,762 --> 01:36:30,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I thought so.
Well, someone will take it.

1041
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:34,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By the way, there's never been
a thief in my family.

1042
01:36:34,435 --> 01:36:38,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on! What about Dad,
may he rest in peace?

1043
01:36:38,106 --> 01:36:40,233  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One was enough!

1044
01:36:40,308 --> 01:36:42,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marina says
you're a good locksmith.

1045
01:36:42,977 --> 01:36:45,172  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That, a plumber, a carpenter...

1046
01:36:45,246 --> 01:36:47,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- An electrician, a mason...
- Perfect!

1047
01:36:48,049 --> 01:36:50,210  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll find you a job
in no time.

1048
01:36:50,284 --> 01:36:53,014  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I suppose you don't mind
working, do you?

1049
01:36:53,087 --> 01:36:55,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I want to work.
- Good.

1050
01:36:55,756 --> 01:36:58,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When we get home...

1051
01:36:58,092 --> 01:37:00,720  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
not a word about the kidnapping
to my Mom.

1052
01:37:00,795 --> 01:37:02,092  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't worry.

1053
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:05,162  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is the exam over?

1054
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:10,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, gimme a kiss,
I'm not that bad!

1055
01:37:10,571 --> 01:37:13,131  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You two sure had me worried.

1056
01:37:13,207 --> 01:37:15,198  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's hear some music.

1057
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,401  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>When I lose all the games</i>

1058
01:37:43,538 --> 01:37:47,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>When I sleep</i>
<i>in the arms of solitude</i>

1059
01:37:48,309 --> 01:37:52,405  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>When I find no more ways out</i>

1060
01:37:53,347 --> 01:37:56,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>And night won't let me rest</i>

1061
01:37:58,286 --> 01:38:02,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>When silence frightens me</i>

1062
01:38:02,957 --> 01:38:06,950  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>When I no longer stand on my feet</i>

1063
01:38:07,962 --> 01:38:11,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>When memories rebel</i>

1064
01:38:12,767 --> 01:38:16,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>And push me against the wall</i>

1065
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:18,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I will survive</i>

1066
01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:21,374  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>And fight for life</i>

1067
01:38:21,442 --> 01:38:23,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I will turn</i>

1068
01:38:23,311 --> 01:38:26,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>Into steel and brace myself</i>

1069
01:38:26,347 --> 01:38:31,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>And even if life's wind</i>
<i>blows harder</i>

1070
01:38:31,185 --> 01:38:36,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I'll be like the reed that bends</i>
<i>but does not break</i>

1071
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:37,887  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I will survive</i>

1072
01:38:37,959 --> 01:38:40,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>And fight for life</i>

1073
01:38:40,861 --> 01:38:42,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it, silly?

1074
01:38:43,531 --> 01:38:45,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We get along just fine!

1075
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,768  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
C'mon, baby!

1076
01:38:50,671 --> 01:38:54,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
<i>I will survive</i>

1077
01:40:47,655 --> 01:40:51,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
