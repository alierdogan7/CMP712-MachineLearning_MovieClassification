Come on, Gupta, get the kind
with the fresh ones!

169
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,834
Damn right I want to! You know why?
Because that's a real guy.

170
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,791
He worries about paying the rent...

171
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,639
...he bleeds when he gets shot,
pukes when he gets sick.

172
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,356
Nick! Spielberg's wife just had a baby.
Should I send that wine and cheese?

173
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,075
Yeah, and some of those muffins
and a note, something personal.

174
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,192
Not too personal. He forgot
to mention me in his AFI speech.

175
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,276
- Add my name.
- OK.

176
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,916
People come to see your movies
because you make them happy.

177
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,352
Call me crazy, but I don't see America
coming out in droves to see you puke.

178
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,118
Besides, they want
Mel Gibson for the role.

179
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,755
- Is it about asses? Is it a butt movie?
- Get up, get up.

180
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,236
The director'll be back in two weeks.

181
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,920
- They'll close the deal.
- Good afternoon, Mr Lang.

182
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,917
Wait a minute. Did you say two weeks?

183
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,476
Two weeks is perfect. Two weeks is
enough. I wanna test for the part.

184
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,352
Test? No, no.

185
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,789
- Ange, listen to me.
- You listen to me!

186
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,115
My mind is made up.
This means too much to me.

187
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,800
I'll pay for the damn test myself!

188
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,870
They'll try to get you
for less, a lot less.

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,390
Ange, please, hold it for one second.
Let me show you something.

190
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,675
Rosalie, please, can you... I got this
off the dish last night. You gotta watch it.

191
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,793
<i>(TV) Four times this Party Crasher
has alerted you...</i>

192
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,354
<i>...before killing someone,
and he still got away.</i>

193
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,870
<i>- You care to comment on that?
- Tie your dick in a knot!</i>

194
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,072
Freeze! Slow-mo, slow-mo.

195
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,069
- Isn't that incredible?
- Uh-huh.

196
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,070
Research, Ange.

197
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,191
Look at this face. Look at those eyes.

198
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,517
That's my character. That's my guide.
That's Ray Casanov.

199
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,200
That's the face of a man
who's been to the edge...

200
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,835
...a man who's tasted fear!
- And vomit.

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,629
I wanna go to New York tonight.
Call the studio. Get 'em to set it up.

202
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,873
I wanna spend two weeks with this guy.
I wanna eat, sleep, breathe John Moss.

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,719
If I can taste his world,
if I can walk his beat...

204
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,593
...if I can get under his skin,
I will nail this part.

205
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,518
- Nickie, I love you.
- I love you too, Ange.

206
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,429
Reality check - you can't leave town.
Your movie opens Friday.

207
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,438
- So what?
- I already booked Johnny, Barbara...

208
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,154
...Phil, Arsenio. Woo-woo-woo-woo!

209
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,589
Tell 'em to run an old one.
They're all the same.

210
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,280
- They just ask about the paternity suit.
- Suits.

211
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,994
What if this cop doesn't
want you tagging after him?

212
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,716
Ange, get real. Two pros exchanging ideas.
Why wouldn't he wanna do it?

213
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,717
Bullshit!
I mean that with all due respect.

214
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,233
There's no way on earth I am gonna
baby-sit some Hollywood rump wrangler.

215
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,478
- I'm on a murder investigation.
- You have no vote. You're off the case.

216
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,310
Look at you. You're all busted up.

217
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,034
If it weren't for Lang,
you'd be on injured leave.

218
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,435
Christ, you can't pull me off this case.

219
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,279
This Party Crasher has
whacked out seven people...

220
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,356
...four of 'em in front of us!

221
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,835
He's nuts! I looked in his eyes.
Know what I saw?

222
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,599
Pleasure. He likes it.
He's gonna do it again. Soon.

223
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,837
Moss, you're off.
Mayor Dinkins insisted.

224
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,556
Evidently this Hollywood actor
asked for you by name.

225
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,354
- What?
- Yes. Come in.

226
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,358
Benny. Wait for me outside.
I gotta talk to you.

227
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,509
All right, here's the story.
Pooley takes over for you.

228
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,712
You are breaking in a new
partner named Ray Casanov.

229
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,116
The guy just wants to blend in,
be another cop on the job...

230
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,196
...so nobody knows he's Nick Lang.

231
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,357
- Yes, sir.
- And Moss, no action.

232
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,916
<i>This guy gets his hair
messed up, we're all in deep shit.</i>

233
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,393
Yes, sir.

234
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,432
- Hey, John.
- Captain?

235
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,394
You got two ways to deal with this. You
got the easy way, you got the hard way.

236
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,991
John, do us all a favour
and make the right choice.

237
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,078
- I always do.
- Good.

238
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,516
Son of a bitch!

239
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,473
Hi, I'm looking
for Lieutenant Moss.

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,150
Oh, God. You...

241
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,356
He's over there relaxin'.

242
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,518
<i>- (Billy) Moss!
- What? What?</i>

243
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,716
You got company.

244
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,636
Hi, John.

245
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,869
Susan. Hi, I...

246
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,597
...didn't expect to see
you here this morning.

247
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,674
- Thank you, Billy.
- Aw, wanna be alone?

248
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,674
I tried calling you yesterday
and this morning.

249
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,509
I got your messages. I would have called
you at home, but I lost your number.

250
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,596
That happens. I lost my keys last week.

251
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,952
- Actually, my daughter Bonnie lost it.
- You know, kids.

252
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,280
Yeah. I wanted to let you know I wasn't
mad, even though you didn't show up.

253
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,269
I didn't think you were one of those
Cro-Magnon jerks who stands people up.

254
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,071
- These are yours, right?
- No, I quit. I don't smoke.

255
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,593
Hi.

256
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,358
Thank you, Benny.

257
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,754
- Bye.
- Bye.

258
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,428
Anyway, I know where you work
cos I saw you on the news.

259
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,240
- You did?
- Yeah.

260
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,999
Good thing Bonnie didn't see you.
I read lips.

261
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,509
Oh, no. That was taken
out of context.

262
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,952
Those reporters can be
real assholes, real irritating.

263
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,796
Hey, hey.

264
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,749
- I wanted to see how you were doin'.
- I'm OK. I'm doing good.

265
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,956
It's not like I wanted to go out...

266
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,197
...tonight... around 8.00.

267
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,356
Oh! Oh. Yeah, well.

268
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,755
So what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

269
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,711
- Tonight?
- Around 8.00.

270
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,479
As a matter of fact, I have no plans.

271
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,429
Great. I'll call you, and we'll make
a plan for a place to go.

272
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,511
OK. All right.

273
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,916
<i>(whistling)</i>

274
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,435
Give me a kiss, baby.
Take a bow, baby.

275
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,790
<i>(Benny) Yeah, yeah! Way to go.</i>

276
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,909
Hey, Moss, heard you got yanked. Sorry.

277
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,076
Hey, that's too bad, John.

278
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,394
You gotta be Casanov.

279
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,516
Fucking A.

280
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,517
Hey, Casanov. You look
a lot like that actor.

281
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,234
- Yeah, Nick Lang.
- Only shorter.

282
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,592
<i>(Grainy) A lot shorter.</i>

283
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,439
OK, ladies, let's get
some real work done here.

284
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,111
Tea break's over. Party Crasher briefing
in the squad room. Let's go.

285
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,471
Psst.

286
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,636
I really am Nick Lang.

287
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,392
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

288
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,996
Aagh!

289
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,278
Lieutenant Moss, I haven't been
this jazzed since the Golden Globes.

290
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,755
I mean, a cop like you
showing me the streets.

291
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,236
The two of us comparing scars.
I have had a couple of scrapes myself.

292
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,909
<i>I got rope burns on Smoking Gun II.
I chafed for a month. It was terrible.</i>

293
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,157
This place is great.
The look, the textures...

294
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,872
<i>- (farts)
... the aroma.</i>

295
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,549
I mean, it's like a movie,
it's so real.

296
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,399
And you don't have
to worry about me screwing up.

297
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,149
I did my homework. I know
police procedures, police lingo...

298
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,236
Hey, homeboy!

299
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,279
I'm in great shape. My trainer's
got me on Nautilus and the StairMaster...

300
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,630
...so you don't have
to worry about Nick Lang.

301
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,435
Son of a bitch!
Caught me off guard there.

302
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,871
You know, Lieutenant,
I can't help but notice...

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,675
...that I'm doing most of
the talking here, which is fine.

304
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,837
I guess you're not a morning
person, and can I relate to that!

305
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,875
Before Esperanza brings me that first cup
of cappuccino, I am toast. Forget about it.

306
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,958
It's decaf. My nutritionist
is cutting down my caffeine.

307
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,514
Whoa!

308
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,756
Turned a little early there.

309
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,710
I was wondering. In order to capture
the essence of the police experience...

310
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,434
...do I get a gun?

311
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,755
For realism.

312
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,632
I mean, Lieutenant...

313
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,196
...it's not like
I'm gonna use the thing.

314
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,393
Although bullets would be nice.

315
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,433
Not if you tied my tongue
to your tailpipe and drove me...

316
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,358
...naked across a field of
broken glass. No, no, no!

317
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,119
- Is this about the actor?
- I gave the maggot a chance.

318
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,435
I got to the bathroom and back.

319
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,030
He doesn't belong here.
He belongs in never-never land...

320
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,276
...with his assistants, his maid...

321
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,518
...and the guy who wipes his ass
after he pinches off his loaf, OK?

322
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,712
<i>- This is about the actor.
- He wants to carry a loaded weapon.</i>

323
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,518
- Send that little jizzball in here.
- Thank you.

324
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,870
Excuse me, gents.
Sorry to interrupt.

325
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,275
- Hi, Captain Brix?
- Yeah.

326
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,039
Nick Lang. I understand
you're in on our secret.

327
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,276
Dave Dinkins sends his best, by the way.

328
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,235
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for all your help in making this possible.

329
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,316
I gotta tell you.

330
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,236
My wife's crazy about you.

331
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,517
We are really big fans!

332
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,915
- Well, uh, what's your wife's name?
- Norma.

333
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,033
If it wasn't for people like you and Norma,
I'd be digging ditches. So, thanks.

334
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,273
Hey. Wow. I just got a great idea.
You and Norma...

335
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,197
- Do you have kids?
- Uh, no...

336
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,995
You and Norma come out to the coast,
see the premiere of the movie.

337
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,350
You can stay at my house with me.

338
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,040
- At your house?
- Do you like the beach?

339
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,315
What we talked about, the jizzball thing?

340
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,749
Yeah. Look, um...

341
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,271
- Would you sign this? To Norma?
- Not a problem. Absolutely.

342

343

Bang, bang...

345
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,195
...Nick Lang.

346
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,235
Thank you. Thank you.

347
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,233
- If there's anything we can do...
- You're doing it.

348
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,993
Thanks. OK.

349
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,076
Thanks, John.

350
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,075
"Bang, bang"?

351
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,589
Get my wife on the phone, would you?

352
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,072
Lieutenant, I was thinking.
I don't really need the gun.

353
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,880
It's probably better
to wait a couple of days...

354
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,629
...until I get this cop thing down pat.
- What have you got?

355
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,558
Coroner's report on that guy
the Party Crasher took out.

356
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,796
Of course, I'm off the case.

357
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,593
Safety bullets, hollow points.
That figures.

358
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,790
Custom-made. Look at this thing!

359
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,957
Looks like that Darth Vader thing
we took off the Dead Romeos.

360
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,117
Yeah. Are they buying from
the same guy the Party Crasher is?

361
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,708
- Check this.
- Might have to ask the Dead Romeos.

362
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,752
- Not me, of course. I'm off the case.
- Sorry to hear it.

363
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,471
I'll be introducing my new partner, Ray
Casanov, to the pleasures of a frog dog.

364
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,398
Frog dog, Ray! Mmm, tasty!

365
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,872
- Frog dog?
- Ribbet!

366
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,438
<i>(Moss) Look at this. I'm moving
to Florida, I swear to God.</i>

367
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,279
Get outta the way!

368
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,312
I guess cops can drive
as fast as they want, huh?

369
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,875
Look, Moss, let's get
on the same page here, OK?

370
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,993
I'm sensing that you're not
completely happy with this situation.

371
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,078
That's fine, OK? Cos I'm here
for one reason only.

372
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,754
You are the best. You're a heavyweight.

373
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,269
You're a Yoda among cops.

374
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,113
You know Yoda?
Little guy, big ears, real smart.

375
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,119
So it doesn't matter what you think of me,
cos I have respect for you.

376
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,276
And that is where I'm coming from.

377
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,837
Look, dickwad, I don't give
a rat's ass where you're coming from.

378
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,032
- I just care about where you're going.
- Good, we're talking.

379
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,754
Where do I drop you off?
Where are you staying?

380
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,075
- Give me a name.
- I'm staying with you.

381
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,714
Maybe when my asshole
learns to chew gum.

382
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,879
- I thought this was arranged.
- Nobody arranged jackshit with me.

383
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,198
You know, a lot of people would be
excited to have Nick Lang in their home.

384
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,072
I'll drop you off at their place.

385
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,553
- Listen.
- No!

386
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,670
You listen, you egomaniacal cockroach!

387
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,473
I got yanked off a case so
you could be a cop groupie...

388
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,636
...and now you wanna live in my house?

389
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,958
I got a job to do. I don't have time for
anybody in my house, this car, my life...

390
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,278
...who isn't a) a cop
or b) the Party Crasher. Got it?

391
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,277
So that's what this is about.
You're still after this guy.

392
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,676
Give me the name of a hotel or I bounce
your ass out at the next light.

393
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,916
I dunno. Do you think
that's a good idea?

394
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,759
I don't think Captain Brix
is gonna like it.

395
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,793
I mean, us being separated,
you being back on the case.

396
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,150
Although I'm not
gonna mention anything...

397
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,034
...because if you can't trust
your partner, who can you trust?

- What is that?
- It's a rubber gun. I got it from props.

401
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,354
It'll help me get into character
until I get a gun.

492
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,996
They're blue, right?

493
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,110
You notice something a little
different about our car?

494
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,188
- They stole my bags!
- You shoulda locked 'em in the trunk.

495
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,278
You know, all my clothes were
in those bags. All my stuff!

496
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,356
At least they didn't steal your rubber gun.

497
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,790
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

498
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,354
Look at this. Look at this.

499
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,870
This could be a clue.
I think they're in this bar.

500
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,156
- So?
- So you gotta go in there.

501
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,714
- You gotta get my stuff.
- "Gotta"?

502
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,357
"Gotta"? Listen, Nick.
May I call you Nick?

503
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,596
I'd be happy to help
you with your problem...

504
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,915
...but, first, you gotta fill out a form.

505
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,033
Then I gotta get assigned to the case.
Then you gotta wait a few days, or weeks.

506
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,550
Fine. If that's the way
you wanna be about it, that's great.

507
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,989
Don't worry about it.
I'll go in there.

508
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,078
- I'll get my stuff.
- I cannot wait.

509
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,238
<i>(sirens)</i>

510
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,789
Gee, Moss, we gotta
stop meeting like this.

511
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,435
Look, Benny. I'd appreciate it
if you left me out of the report.

512
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,629
Hi, Grainy.

513
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,880
The captain might not like it, me getting
the new guy shot at on his first day.

514
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,036
- Is that all he wouldn't like?
- What?

515
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,278
If I didn't know you better, I'd say your
mind was still on the Party Crasher case.

516
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,631
- It's a good thing you know me better.
- Yeah, good thing.

517
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,794
So where is Casanov?

518
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,037
<i>(yells)</i>

519
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,551
They didn't have 'em.

520
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,636
<i>(man) And stay the fuck out!</i>

521
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,318
It's been a bad day.

522
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,390
<i>(man) Look at the love boat.</i>

524
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,438
You sure impound didn't have
anything more low-profile?

525
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,632
- Frog dog, Billy.
- I'll have a frog dog too, Billy.

526
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,236
Hi, Bonnie. Is your mother home?

527
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,874
No, this isn't Mr Tibor.
This is...

528
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,753
No, it's not Frankie either.

529
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,032
No, it's not Alphonse. What are these?
Like, guys your mom works with?

530
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,035
No, this is John Moss.

531
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,435
Ah. Well... hello?

532
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,710
<i>(line goes dead)</i>

533
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,877
OK, then I'll call
back later. OK, bye.

534
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,875
- Yo, Bill.
- How ya doin', Lieutenant?

535
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,234
<i>(French accent) Frog dog, huh!</i>

536
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,915
Next time, invite the kid.

537
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,396
- What?
- On your date.

538
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,110
Bring the daughter along.

539
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,513
I don't know what the hell
you're talkin' about.

540
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,715
Oh, do you have any Grey Poupon?

541
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,314
A single mother.
Daughter never had a dad.

542
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,199
Doesn't trust men,
especially ones around her mom.

543
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,871
You wanna get next to this woman,
but you can't catch a break from the kid.

544
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,155
I know, it's a gift.

545
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,073
Why would I wanna bring
the daughter along?

546
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,954
Never mind. What the hell
am I talking about this with you for?

547
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,591
- Banzai!
- Konnichiwa.

548
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,360
- Oh, Bill.
- Oh, Bill.

549
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,480
Good stuff. You eat
like this all the time?

550
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,389
Probably not the best idea...

551
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,797
...from a health point of view.

552
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,388
You know, if you...

553
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,830
...be good to your bowels,
then they will be good to you.

554
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,996
Your nutritionist, right?

555
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,429
Do you want her number, John?

556
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,592
Bravo, Bill!

557
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,870
Oh, Bill, good.

558
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,076
OK. Knock that shit off, all right?

559
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,430
It's like carrying a goddamn mirror around.

560
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,870
Don't eat like me, don't sit like me,
and do not smoke like me.

561
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,877
- I'm trying to quit, anyway.
- Me too.

562
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,514
And don't quit like me either. All right?

563
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,474
- John, an actor's job is to...
- Lang, I don't care.

564
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,273
All right! Just stop!

565
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,595
All right. OK.

566
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,876
Tell me about the Party Crasher.

567
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,152
What's this guy's programme?
He kills four people right in front of you?

568
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,555
- What does it take to do that?
- The guy's nuts.

569
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,719
Too many birds in his antenna. I dunno
what the hell it takes. He's crazy.

570
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,389
- You ever kill anybody?
- Counting today?

571
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,231
John, my character kills a guy,
probably an innocent bystander.

572
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,669
- I wanna know what that's like.
- You can't.

573
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,678
Open up! I wanna know what it's like
to be inside your skin.

574
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,633
I don't want you inside my skin!

575
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,354
It's private. What's in there
belongs to me.

576
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,031
You won't learn what it means to be a cop
by eating hot dogs and asking questions.

577
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,273
We live this job. It's something
we are, not something we do.

578
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,517
When a cop walks up to a car
and has to give a speeding ticket...

579
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,871
...he knows he may have to kill someone
or be killed himself.

580
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,788
That's not something you step into
by strapping on a rubber gun.

581
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,356
You go back to your million-dollar house,
your bimbos and blow jobs.

582
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,471
You get 17 takes to get it right.

583
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,678
We get one take.
It lasts our whole lives.

584
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,597
We mess it up and we're dead.

585
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,112
Fuck, was that great! I'm so...

586
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,519
Look, John. Can you just do
that one more time for me? Please?

587
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,796
John! Oh, well.

588
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,910
John Moss, meaning of life.

589
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,116
John!

590
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,788
<i>(radio) Fourth squad lieutenant. Homicide
in the churchyard. Party Crasher MO.</i>

591
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,436
<i>(Moss) Stay here.</i>

592
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,030
<i>- (Moss) What have you got?
- Same story.</i>

593
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,517
The prick called to say he's coming. The
guy in the church figures it's a crank call.

594
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,269
None of our guys ever had a shot at him.
Some crank call, huh?

595
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,789
What do we know about the victim?
How ya doing?

596
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,833
Neighbourhood transvestite,
entertainer, singer. Never had a chance.

597
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,997
- Still no line on the killer?
- What's this prick doin' here?

598
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,316
Looks like he's got you turned around.

599
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,148
- Hey...
- Hey, go tie your dick in a knot!

600
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,113
Benny, can you write this up?
What's with you?

601
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,435
I can't believe he'd kill in broad daylight.

602
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,869
He's a hambone like you,
he craves attention.

603
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,753
Know what a hambone
hates more than anything else?

604
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,348
- What's that?
- A bad review.

605
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,876
Hey, Frank! Frank!

606
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,712
You want an interview? You got it.
Make sure you get a shot of that body.

607
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,594
Lieutenant Moss. So, what's your
assessment of this Party Crasher?

608
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,553
You don't need a shrink to tell
you he's a raving psycho.

609
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,716
Come to think of it,
he may not even be a man.

610
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,957
I doubt he's got the equipment
for it. He's probably a pervert.

611
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,675
<i>What is your assessment

<i>You got that, you chickenshit,

00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,830
<i>That's a promise from me to you.</i>

626
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,473
Whoa. Look at this.

627
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,918
- When's your housekeeper coming?
- My what?

628
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,314
Well, you know.

629
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,874
You think cops live in filth,
like in the movies?

630
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,151
No, it's just that
you gotta admit, John...

631
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,034
...filth has a certain
reality to it, a certain edge.

632
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,835
Not that this doesn't. I mean,
this is very fresh, very unexpected.

633
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,518
Hey, you play piano?

634
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,916

<i>Where there's smoke...</i>

637
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,990
You know the high part?

638
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,509
My dad played.

639
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,949
Ah! Now that's what I mean.

640
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,596
Cop's dad plays piano.
That's a great notion. I love that.

641
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,349
It's got its own reality,
its own authenticity.

642
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,755
- It's very unexpected...
- It's my life.

643
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,351
Too bad I can't use it.
Nobody'd believe it.

644

billboard down the street.

Hey, John... People find me
wherever I go. It's like a curse.

650
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,434

not having any privacy?

You have seven different

So, a date, huh? It'd be an education
to see what you're like with a woman.

686
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,795
A situation fraught
with sexual tension.

687
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,039
Don't suppose you wanna
make it a threesome, huh?

688
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,073
Eight facial expressions.
Nine. Ten. Wow!

689
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,639
I'll tell you what. I don't
have to go. I'll just...

Rum drinks, fern bar, gerbil racing.

691
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,792
Take that gun out of your pants before
you shoot your dick off. Gerbil racing!

They're my favourite part.

- I hate them.
- Right. OK, good.

Why don't we get a pizza
half with anchovies, half without?

699

Sometimes they slide to the other side.

That's only when the cook
forgets to kill them first.

701
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,356
- You haven't told us how you got hurt.
- A little accident on the job.

702
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,678
A little accident?
This is our third date, our fourth date.

703

where I was born, about my parents...

- How much you weigh.

705

How much I weigh. And I know you're
a cop who hates to talk about himself.

I don't hate to talk about myself.

- Yeah, I do.

708

So I tell you what.

We're not saying a word until
you tell us something personal.

Something you love,
something you hate.

I like Mel Gibson now.

818
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,595
Susan.

819
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,879
Su...

820
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,672
Sss...

821
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,829
Susan. Susan.

822
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,478
- Yes, John?
- Is she...

823
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,280
Are you seeing other men?

824
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,356
No, John. It's only you.

825
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,632
That's why it's so hard.
I want you, John.

826
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,515
But you just won't let me in.

827
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,359
- Thank you.
- Just a little...

828
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,358
- Ridiculous.
- I thought you were quitting for me.

829
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,119
- This is too strange.
- I'll tell you what's strange.

830
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,313
That somebody so strong
isn't confident in who he is.

831
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,671
- That's bullshit!
- Don't take that tone with me.

832
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,712
- Look... honey.
- Honey's good.

833
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:54,789
Ever since my divorce, yes, every time
I get serious about a woman, I get scared.

834
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,435
- How many women have there been?
- None, except for my wife.

835
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,790
- And me.
- And you. I mean, not you...

836
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,673
So how do you know you
get scared every time?

837
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,188
This is just like a woman. You turn it
around, give it a twist, you stick it in.

838
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,630
God! You know what?
I am outta here.

839
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,320
Bye. Keep your little Dubonnet.
I'm gone.

840
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,356
Ah, men.

841
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,916
You son of a bitch!

842
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,636
You son of a bitch!

843
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,795
<i>(grunting)</i>

844
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,311
I can't even go to the bathroom!

845
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,556
Mr Witherspoon?

846
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,430
Not looking for the repeat
customers, huh?

847
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,359
Ohh! Givin' me a hard-on, here.

848
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,917
Try skippin' a few meals. Somewhere,
there's a small country going hungry.

849
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,359
What's the matter with this guy?
Cat got your tongue?

850
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,196
We don't know who got it. Got bit
off in a street fight last year.

851
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,311
He won.

852
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,594
- That's my daughter.
- She's beautiful.

853
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,712
Thank you. She's with me once a month.

854
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,989
- Likes to play while I do business.
- Speaking of business...

855
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,395
Speaking of business.

856
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,308
Our mutual friend indicated to you
that I'm looking for a bored-out. 45...

857
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,876
...that can't be traced, something
that won't blow up in my hands.

858
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,471
I can't help you.
I don't know nothin' from guns.

859
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,239
- Right.
- This man sounds like a cop.

860
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,638
Cop! Why? Cos I don't like being fondled
in public by some fat guy with a crush?

861
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,196
It's a joke.

862
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,596
I got money, plenty of
money, Mr Witherspoon. I got...

863
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,438
Hey! Mr Witherspoon, look.
No, no. It's just...

864
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,196
I got nowhere else to turn.

865
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,514
There's this guy. He's all over me.

866
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,278
It's a friggin' nightmare.

867
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,356
He's forced his way into my life.

868
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,472
He's told me, face-to-face,
that he wants to be me.

869
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,388
He moved into my apartment,
moved into my house, moved into my job.

870
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,875
What's next? You know? My old lady?

871
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,951
I know it. Everywhere I look,
I see his smiling face.

872
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,993
I turn on the goddamn TV and I hear his
voice, ya-ta-ta-ta, at me all the time!

873
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,238
You gotta help me. I have got
to get rid of this guy. Please?

874
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,878
Passionate man!

875
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,033
- Watch Julie for me.
- Thank you.

No, I... I'm not quite sure.

888
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,437
Right. Got it. OK, I'll be there.

00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,391
Uh-huh.

890
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,118
If I'm not still handcuffed
to the goddamn sofaaaaa!

891
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,109
I have to be careful.

892
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,992
You understand.

893
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,874
The police frown on the guns I make.

894
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,635
People have occasionally used them...

895
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,878
...for socially irresponsible acts,
but what am I supposed to do?

896
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,036
Exactly.

897
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,388
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

898
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,354
This is it. This is
just what I was looking for.

899
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,391
It is a beautiful gun.

900
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,830
Oh, by the way, remember
when I said I wasn't a cop?

901
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,432
I was acting. Not bad, huh? No training.

902
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,075
Can you believe people get paid for that?

903
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,111
<i>- (yells)
- Don't even think about it!</i>

904
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,232
You made a gun like this
with a laser sight, for someone else.

905
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,158
Tall guy, muscular build.
You're gonna help me find him.

906
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,637
- What did he do?
- He's been blowing holes in people.

907
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,551
- The Party Crasher?
- Where is he now?

908
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,195
I didn't know. He meets me.

909
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,151
Gives me some design specs.

910
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,394
I do 'em. I figure he was a gun fanatic.

911
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,998
He's waiting for a gun
I got now in the shop.

912
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,312
Well, you're gonna meet him
tomorrow. You got it?

913
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,793
O... O... OK.

914
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,352
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's just been one of those mornings.

915
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,836
- Couldn't get out of bed?
- No. I mean, no.

916
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,351
No, I just... just busy down at
the precinct. You know, this and that.

917
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,353
- Did you order?
- Yeah. I didn't know if you were coming.

918
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,473
It's all right.
I'll just find something real quick here.

919
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,556
All right. OK. Excuse me. Oh!

920
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,511
I, uh... took this perp in this morning...

921
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:14,193
...and I lost the key down a drain
after I un-cuffed him.

922
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,112
OK. Can I have the number six, with
romaine instead of iceberg lettuce...

923
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,073
...sprouts if they're fresh,
and a mustard vinaigrette?

924
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,919
No. You can have
what's on the menu, though.

925
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,191
- Can I have an Evian with lemon?
- I got tap water with ice.

926
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,429
Fine.

927
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,595
<i>(Susan chuckles)</i>

928
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,430
The reason I asked you
here is... well, is John.

929
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,670
- You guys are pretty close, right?
- Oh, yeah. Course.

930
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,075
You might say John's been
a role model for me.

931
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,516
On our first date, I thought
"Wow, who is this guy?"

932
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,238
He was so attentive, he was so giving
and he was such a good listener...

933
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,319
...but by the 2nd and 3rd date, I thought
"I wish this guy would loosen up...

934
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,317
...maybe talk about himself. "

935
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,356
Maybe he's just not interested.

936
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,471
- Oh, he is.
- Yeah?

937
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,160
Susan, believe me.

938
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,829
See, I just met you. How come I
feel closer to you than I do to him?

939
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,678
Well, that's...

940
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,031
- We haven't even slept together yet.
- Well, no, I...

941
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,518
<i>I want to. (chuckles)</i>

942
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,709
I used to have this speech
impediment. I couldn't say no.

943
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,070
Bonnie cured me of that.
She cured me of a lot of things.

944
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,796
Never thought I'd date a cop.

945
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,916
What's it like?

946
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,833
It's kinda hard to put into words.

947
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,475
I mean, we live this job.

948
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,637
It's something we are,
not something we do.

949
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,355
You can't become a cop by strappin'
on a gun and ridin' around all day.

950
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,392
When a cop walks up to
give someone a speeding ticket...

951
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,956
...he knows he might have
to kill someone, or be killed himself.

952
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,198
People think this job is like in the movies,
where you get 17 takes to get it right.

953
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,790
We get one take... and
it lasts our whole lives.

954
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,195
We mess it up...

955
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,197
...and we're dead!

956
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,071
Wow.

957
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,313
I wish John would express himself
like that. You know, like... mm!

958
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,355
I'm sorry. I just get...

959
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,755
It's nice having a police escort home.

960
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,674
- You like kids?
- Yeah, yeah.

961
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,873
Kids are great. They're like little people.

962
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,597
You were a big hit
with Bonnie last night.

963
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,676
Well, Bonnie's great.

964
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,116
Susan, listen.

965
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,996
This isn't right. OK? I know where
this is going and it's all wrong.

966
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,839
- What's all wrong?
- It happens to me all the time.

967
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,919
But it's best if we drop it now,
put it behind us, and nobody'll get hurt.

968
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,076
- Ray, I don't...
- I don't know what it is.

969
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,795
Maybe it's cos I look like Nick Lang.
Women go for that boyish type...

970
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,435
...but it's not fair to John.
- Ray, wait a minute. Did you think...

971
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,630
I mean, this isn't about you...

972
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,399
<i>I mean, you don't think
I'm attracted to you?</i>

973
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,674
You know.

974
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,997
No, no. Come on.
You attracted to me?

975
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,832
- No. Why would you be attracted to me?
- I'm sorry.

976
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,394
Of course, maybe if you got
to know me better.

977
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,028
- What we got here?
- Leave her alone!

978
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,190
Don't worry. Shh. He's a cop.

979
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,435

- You were wrong.

Oh, Ray, what happened? You OK?

1034
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,509
- I'm fine.
- Can I talk to my partner?

1035
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,713
What the hell's going on? Coincidence?
You wanted to see a New York subway...

1036
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,149
...and you happened to be
on the one Susan was on!

1037
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,316
- I invited him to lunch.
- You what?

1038
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,829
- I can explain.
- You don't have to.

1039
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,794
First you bust up our date. Then
you're having lunch with my girlfriend!

1040
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,036
Oh, cut the jealousy bit.
You got no right.

1041
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,237
Take a few pointers from Ray.
He knows how to deal with people.

1042
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,709
And from what I saw,
he's probably a better cop.

1043
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,992
While you were probably trashing pizza
parlours, he was dealing with real felons...

1044
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,997
...without losing his head.

1045
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,314
Goodbye. Call me.

1046
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,035
I can't believe you just...
You just kissed him? You kissed his face?

1047
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,714
And where are my handcuffs?
I have to pay for those!

1048
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:40,039
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Why would you handcuff me to the bed?

1049
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,869
I was good in there, John. Seriously.
We were major cojones!

1050
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,237
So what is this? What? What?!

1051
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,188
I know. OK. I left him on his own.
Guilty as charged, sir.

1052
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,279
But... the guy's OK, right?
Not that that's any excuse.

1053
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,678
You won't like that this happened while
I was working on the Party Crasher case.

1054
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,349
But before you say what you have
every right to say, listen to this.

1055
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,313
I know where the Party Crasher's
gonna be tomorrow.

1056
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,116
If we get every available car, call the
shots ourselves, we can drop him cold!

1057
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,916
- How?
- He's gonna pick up a gun tomorrow.

1058

- No, Moss, you stay with Lang...

1062

01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,555
- What?
- I wanna make a full confession.

1143
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,714
Do I look like a priest?

1144
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,952
Don't try talking me out of it
cos my mind's made up.

1145
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,110
<i>(laughter)</i>

1146
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,470
<i>(man) "Moss, Moss! Help me, Moss!"</i>

1147
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,910
"He's coming straight at me.
What should I do?"

1148
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,474
I come bursting through
the door, like a maniac.

1149
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,479
This imbecile, his eyes are completely
closed, squeezes off a few shots.

1150
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,273
<i>(laughter)</i>

1151
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,671
So I slap my chest, go flying down
the stairs, head over heels...

1152
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,400
...and land right on top of the fuckin' guy.

1153
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,350
Now he's sittin' there...
I'm dyin' on a piss, holding my breath.

1154
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,871
Next thing I know, Moss is going
into this incredible performance, going...

1155
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,514
..."Don't worry, Nick. It's OK."

1156
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,712
"I'll take the fall for you.
You go back to Hollywood. "

1157
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,794
And he believes him!

1158
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,275
It was unreal. He sticks the kid on
a plane and he gets him outta his hair.

1159
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,836
- Moss is back on the case.
- He's on that sting operation.

1160
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,993
Nick. Nickie, baby!

1161
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,635
You sharpshooter! We heard about you.

1162
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,115
<i>(laughter)</i>

1163
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,476
"It never happened, Nick.
I'll take the fall for you, Nick. "

1164
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,875
Son of a bitch! You stupid...

1165
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,033
<i>(Moss) Stakeouts. Do you get
haemorrhoids sitting here, like, forever?</i>

1166

<i>(Benny) I think I had 'em
the last 13 years.</i>

1167
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,631
- I hate it.
- Can't do nothin' about it.

1168
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,030
- I might try hypnosis.
- That shit don't work.

1169
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,515
Something's gotta work.

1170
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,835
With you, I don't know what works.

1171
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,916
Love certainly isn't doing it.

1172
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,071
He's half an hour late.

1173
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,829
<i>- (Witherspoon) I don't like it.
- I don't like this either.</i>

1174
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,794
I could've been home watching the Nacho
Prince against the Cuchi Frito Kid.

1175
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,229
WrestleMania 14. Pay-per-view.

1176
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,715
Fuck no. We're here hanging out with you.

1177
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:15,800
Oh, shit. Here he comes!

1178
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,032
Oh, boy. That's him.

1179
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,238
We've got contact.
Stay on your toes. Wait for the signal.

1180
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,349
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you very much.

1181
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,149
It's beautiful!

1182
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,190
Damn it!

1183
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,512
<i>I bet you can hear me, Lieutenant Moss.
I just bet you can.</i>

1184
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,354
I think it's time we had a talk.

1185
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:12,756
I think it's time
we got to know each other.

1186
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,753
You obviously, you just don't
understand what I'm trying to do.

1187
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,590
Don't make me kill him!

1188
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,190
- High noon.
- Moss, watch your ass, man.

1189
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,112
Relax, Benny.

1190
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,196
Yo!

1191
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,156
Close enough.

1192
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,877
I've been looking forward to this...

1193
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,911
...meeting my opponent.

1194
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:05,352
Tell me, Lieutenant,
why are you doing this?

1195
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,471
Doing what, exactly?

1196
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,234
Why are you treating me like a criminal?

1197
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,553
I don't know. Because... you are one?

1198
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,071
No, I'm not.

1199
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,478
You're a police officer. You should
understand what I'm trying to do.

1200
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,835
We're playing the same game, Lieutenant.

1201
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,554
We're hooked into the same programme.

1202
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,960
I haven't done anything wrong. Anything.

1203
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:49,471
I killed a pimp. I killed a drug dealer. I kill
the people that make your life difficult.

1204
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,349
- You killed a four-year-old girl.
- You sacrifice pawns.

1205
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,436
You play chess, Lieutenant?

1206
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,789
I would've been a great cop.
Better than you.

1207
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,953
Because I'm smarter than you.
I'm smarter and I'm better than you are!

1208
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,838
OK. OK. You wanna be a cop? Uh...

1209
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,630
Maybe it's not too late.

1210
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,957
I could put in a word.
We could work something out.

1211
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,710
Hey, Lieutenant... you think I'm stupid?

1212
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,040
I was... hoping you were stupid...

1213
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,549
...but, no, I don't think you're stupid.

1214
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,838
A little crazy, maybe.

1215
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,911
Don't shoot! He'll blow the place up.
I'm standing in the shit.

1216
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,469
Game's over!

01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,670
I'm at the Beacon Theater,

There you are, you son of a bitch!

1227

- Police officer.
- Can I help you?

1228
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,910
- See a man, red shirt, blonde hair?
- No.

<i>If you see him, do not interact with him.</i>

1230
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,079
- Police.
- Yeah, and where's your badge?

1231

Hey, come back here! Shit.

1232
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,114
Move outta the way.
I didn't pay to see your butt.

1233
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,275

Look. I was gonna leave a message

OK, lock it up.

Well, now you know.
It feels like shit, huh?

It's private.

01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,513
Damn! I hate it when he does that!

- Is that male bonding?
- Yeah, that's like talking to my ex-wife.

- Shut up and keep driving.

Slow down. Aaagh!

1287

- I got a month to live, so...
- You're shitting me.

1289
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:04,113
I'm not shitting anything. See, it starts
with the tumour and it goes to the colon.

01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,195
Shh!

1473
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,917
This is all stuff I said to him.
The son of a bitch stole my life!

1474
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:49,874
Would you shut up, Moss?
We're trying to watch the end credits.

1475
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,158
<i># Don't call it a comeback...</i>

1476
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:52,797
<i>#... I been here for years</i>

1477
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,475
<i># I'm rockin' my peers
puttin' suckers in fear</i>

1478
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,034
<i># Makin' the tears
rain down like a monsoon</i>

1479
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,037
He's a lot shorter in real life, OK?

1480
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,474
<i># Explosion</i>

1481
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,555
<i># Overpowerin'</i>

1482
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,557
<i># Over the competition I'm towerin'</i>

1483
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,069
<i># Wreckin' shop
when I drop these lyrics</i>

1484
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,952
<i># That'll make you call the cops</i>

1485
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:12,231
<i># Don't you dare stare
You better move</i>

1486
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:14,476
<i># Don't ever compare me to the rest</i>

1487
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,397
<i># That'll all get sliced and diced</i>

1488
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,158
<i># Competition's payin' the price</i>

1489
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:20,236
<i># I'm gonna knock you out</i>

1490
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,476
<i># Mama said knock you out</i>

1491
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,670
<i># I'm gonna knock you out</i>

1492
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,950

01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,196

1496
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,155
<i># Mama said knock you out</i>

1497
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,874
<i># Don't you call this
a regular jam</i>

1498
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,513
<i># I'm gonna rock this land</i>

1499
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:43,757
<i># I'm gonna take this
itty-bitty world by storm</i>

1500
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:44,995
<i># And I'm just gettin' warm</i>

1501
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:48,396
<i># Just like Muhammad Ali
They called him Cassius</i>

1502
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,909
<i># Watch me bash this beat
like a skull</i>

1503
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,871
<i># That you know I had beef with</i>

1504
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,072
<i># Why do you riff with me,
the maniac psycho</i>

1505
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,758
<i># And when I pull out my jammy
get ready</i>

1506
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,678
<i># Cos it might go blaw!
How ya like me now?</i>

1507
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,950
<i># The ripper will not allow</i>

1508
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:05,036
<i># You to get with Mr Swift</i>

1509
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,434
<i># Don't riff</i>

1510
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,879
<i># Listen to my gears shift</i>

1511
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,797
<i># I'm blastin', outlastin'</i>

1512
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,434
<i># Kinda like Shaft,
so you could say I'm shaftin'</i>

1513
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,152
<i># Olde English filled my mind</i>

1514
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,475
<i># And I came up with a funky rhyme</i>

1515
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,716
