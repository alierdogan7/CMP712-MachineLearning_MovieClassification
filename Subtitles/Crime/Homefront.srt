2
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,862
They're in.

3
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:11,866
- This will make me happy.
- How much do we cook ?

4
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:14,789
This batch will yield 30 pounds.

5
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,954
- Move tweak!
- Are you fucking kiddin' me?

6
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:23,319
Don't be lighting that shit up in here.
Take it outside JoJo.

7
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:24,577
Allright.

8
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,805
The deal we had was 50 keys by a plane JT.
Your guy gets held up in Port Arthur, that is not my problem.

9
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:33,368
Danny will appreciate that.

10
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:37,252
- Everything set?
- Yeah all good . Same plane , same pilot, same price .

11
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:42,215
Fuck this half-ass plane.
We have 20 hardcore motherfuckers who can drive this shit to Tucson.

12
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:45,741
Well my way is the safe way.
Your call , Danny.

13
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:51,207
Look, you're my kid, but we doin' it Daltons way.

14
00:02:52,147 --> 00:02:56,233
Everybody, let's start packin' this shit up.
We're outta here in 30 minutes. Let's go!

15
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,339
Let's roll boys!

16
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,800
DEA!

17
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,382
Don't move! Show me your hands!
Get 'em up! Get on the ground!

18
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,906
Somebody give me a 20 on my agent inside!

19
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:47,124
You were one of us, you fucking rat!

20
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,088
What the fuck was that?

21
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,379
- Jojo , let's get the fuck outta here!
- Drop your weapons!

22
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,039
Freeze!

23
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:10,307
No! He's undercover!
Man down!

24
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,131
Stand the fuck down!

25
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,155
Put your fucking weapons down!

26
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:28,747
Take that motherfucker!

27
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:36,373
All units, I got 2 on the move.
Dark green muscle car heading south-east on Saint Bernard towards MLK.

28
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:40,338
Agent in pursuit. I repeaet : agent in pursuit.

29
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,904
Motherfucker!

30
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,948
There's cops all over the fucking place!

31
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,123
Come on dope, you wanna play chicken motherfucker?
Let's do this!

32
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,502
Out of the car , Danny !
Out of the car!

33
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:29,268
You rat motherfucker!

34
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:35,916
Drop the gun!

35
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:40,159
Drop it JoJo.
Drop the gun! Drop it!

36
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,646
Drop the gun!
Man down!

37
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:49,970
Keep away!

38
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:28,409
You were one of us.
You murdered my son , you motherfucker!

39
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,653
You're dead!
Your kids are fucking dead!

40
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:39,500
He was down. He was down!
He went for his gun. That's protocol, Broker!

41
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:44,585
Broker!

42
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:47,588
Don't walk away from me!
Broker!

43
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:33,296
TWO YEARS LATER

44
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:25,150
- Cool hat.
- Thanks .

45
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,728
- Give it back.
- Are you scared?

46
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:46,452
- I said : give it back.
- You want it? Come get it!

47
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,816
What you gonna do about it?
Cry?

48
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,940
Go on, cry.

49
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,784
- I asked you twice.
- Twice what, loser?

50
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,073
I asked twice.

51
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,142
Yeah, if you're gonna take the job you might as well do it right.

52
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:16,684
There's all kind of wood you can get here.

53
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:20,326
You got virgin Cypress, you got, you got long leaf pine.

54
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,149
You got that punctured treated pine, well that's my favourite one.

55
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,074
Now if anybody wanna use the cheapest shit they can find,
might as well buy that shit from IKEA.

56
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:30,856
Look at this.
Mites done ate all through it.

57
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,463
Wonder why you gotta do the job again every two years.

58
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:37,826
- Look at this.
- Hello?

59
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,193
- Be right there.
- Something wrong?

60
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,635
Something at Maddy's school.

61
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:51,879
- You okay to finish?
- Damn man, I'm working with you, not for you bro.

62
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:57,285
- Hey Broker, don't sweat it, it's probably nothing.
- Yeah, you could be right.

63
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,768
I don't feel calm, so why the hell should I stay calm?

64
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:43,613
No, it's making no logical damn sense.
Now I want this thing settled, and I mean now.

65
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:48,257
- Don't get yourself all wound up like this honey.
- Who is that? Do you know him?

66
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,539
Do you know him ?

67
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,303
Is that the father of that goddamn little girl?
Are you the father?

68
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:57,506
- Mr. Broker?
- What happened?

69
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:01,431
Maddy 's fine. She is in the classroom.
Come with me.

70
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,953
I want to see my boy .

71
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:07,676
Teddy, baby, are you okay?
Does it hurt?

72
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:12,162
He's got blood all over his goddamn new shirt Jimmy.
That's why you gotta watch these sneaky little bitches in playgrounds..

73
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:16,686
Hey? Hey? Hey What? Huh?
Hey what? You wanna say something to me?

74
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:20,289
- I would just let them leave the building.
- Why is the sheriff there?

75
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,176
For Cassie Bodine .
Last time we had to see him with Cassie she threatened the principal.

76
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:27,536
Their son is a special needs case.

77
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:30,980
- By the way, I'm Susan Hetch , the school psychologist.
- Phil Broker.

78
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,063
Listen, you've got a great girl.

79
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:40,692
You allright?

80
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:46,598
- What happened ?
- I warned him two times like I was supposed to.

81
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:51,161
Schoolyard monitor sais she saw Maddy hit Teddy pretty hard.
She knew what she was doing.

82
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:54,005
- He started it, he's a bully.
- Maddy, come on.

83
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:57,928
Maybe this is my fault.
I taught her to defend herself.

84
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,772
- You think it's good teaching your little girl how to fight?
- No.

85
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:04,095
Defend herself though, yeah.

86
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:08,339
Hey Maddy, do you mind waiting in the hall for just a minute?

87
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,501
- Yes , ma'am.
- Thank you.

88
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:19,630
So why did you guys move up here?
It's a little remote for most people.

89
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:23,354
She wanted a horse.

90
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,998
Maddy 's mother grew up around here, so.

91
00:13:27,838 --> 00:13:29,761
It would be a good place
to start rebuilding .

92
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:32,644
Her file sais that your wife died fairly recently.

93
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:36,929
- Last year .
- Yeah, it's been hard on her.

94
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:40,093
Her mom was sick for a while.

95
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:43,934
Anything else?

96
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,545
- Why is he picking on me?
- He picks on you because he thinks you're different.

97
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,907
- But I'm not different.
- Well to him you are.

98
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:00,352
And nothing is happening about it.
So this guy here keeps walking along.

99
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:04,076
- Nothing happening there! Do it!
- All right!

100
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:07,759
- Hey Broker!
- Stand by the car.

101
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,283
- What's wrong?
- Go stand by the car.

102
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,701
- Don't take any shit , Jimmy.

103
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:12,965
Jimmy, back in the truck please.

104
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:19,252
- You owe my son a goddamn apology.
- Take it easy.

105
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:24,157
- Jimmy, back in the truck please.
- Some sneaky little bitch cheap shots my son,

106
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:27,178
 somebody owes us a goddamn apology.
- That's goddamn right!

107
00:14:27,258 --> 00:14:31,183
Don't go there. Please, don't go there.
Get in the truck please , honey.

108
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:33,066
- Don't turn your back on me.
- Honey, baby, get in the truck.

109
00:14:33,187 --> 00:14:34,929
Get him Jimmy. Get him Jimmy!

110
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,533
- Arrest him!

111
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:42,875
Keith, protect him!
What the fuck are you doing?

112
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:45,439
- Get this motherfucker outta here!
- Move away.

113
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,502
- Goddamned, what are you doing?
Keith, what the fuck are you doing?
- Cassie, shut up.

114
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:53,726
- You gonna let him get away with that?
- It's OK, get in the truck.

115
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:56,330
- It doesn't look OK.
- It's OK.

116
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:59,533
- In the truck.
- Do something, will ya?

117
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:02,056
Breathe , Jimmy. Jesus Christ.

118
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,698
Yes , mosy on over.

119
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:10,063
- Am I in trouble here?
- No I saw what happened. He was outta line.

120
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:15,549
You really had to take him down that hard though?
You passed the man in front of his child, Mr. Broker.

121
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:19,153
Is she allright?

122
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:25,159
Are you allright?
So you moved into the old Griffin place a while back?

123
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,044
- What do you do ?- What are you doing to keep busy around here?
- Is there a reason you're asking these questions?

124
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,287
Well, maybe I'm just being friendly.

125
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:35,890
Or maybe I'm bored or maybe I'm curious.
Or whatever. It doesn't matter.

126
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:40,335
- It's my right to ask.
- Things got outta hand sherrif, it won't happen again.

127
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,344
Daddy, there's a bunch of teachers watching us right now.

128
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:18,293
- You're a pussy.
- What?

129
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:21,618
I said you are a motherfucking pussy.

130
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:24,019
That's what you are.

131
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:29,545
You let him make fools out of all of us, in front of everybody.

132
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:33,109
- After half an hour the whole fucking town will know .
- I've lost my godd...

133
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,391
- What Jimmy? You lost what?
- I've lost my balance.

134
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:40,156
- Fucking lost your balance. He spun you drunk, you were on your ass.
- Momma, don't curse.

135
00:16:40,316 --> 00:16:42,680
- Dad tripped just like me.
- What's the plan, Jimmy?

136
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,641
Right now nothing.
We still got Keith on our tail.

137
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:47,444
Fuck Keith.

138
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:53,210
How did he buy that new truck?
That's what I wanna know. How did he buy that new truck?

139
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:56,052
- Who?
- Who? Fucking who?

140
00:16:57,212 --> 00:17:00,176
Him, motherfucker who put you down.
You forgettin' him?

141
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:05,423
My god he put you down so hard.

142
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:15,673
- I gotta see my brother.
- Let's just keep this a familly matter, Cas.

143
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:19,717
What do you call him?

144
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,404
Yeah, now you're acting all big. Fucking idiot.

145
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:18,016
Good afternoon. Little tweaker birds. Kicking up some shit.

146
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:23,220
Why don't you turn that music off?
Turn that fucking music off!

147
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:28,667
Hey, how old are you ?

148
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,710
17.

149
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:35,334
- Allright go on. Get outta here.
- Are you coming...?

150
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:38,037
- They ain't coming. Get the fuck outta here!

151
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,562
As for you guys ...

152
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,097
My name is Gator Bodine.

153
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:00,980
I hope I didn't hurt you too badly, sir?

154
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,126
I just wanted you to get a little taste of what's
gonna happen to you

155
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,367
 if you keep cooking this illegal
substance in my neck of the woods.

156
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:12,753
Look man, we mean no disrespect.
This here is just for us, you know...

157
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:17,197
I don't doubt it. Just fun.
Kids having fun.

158
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:20,640
Enjoying life.
Celebrate.

159
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,125
Well, I'ma warn you.

160
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,966
I've got a 5 gallon can of gasoline out in my truck

161
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,729
that I will happily pour down your fucking throats.

162
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,815
If I ever catch you cooking and stinking up my town again.

163
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:43,143
Stop!

164
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,708
Now listen up.

165
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,792
I don't wanna have to kill a bunch of little kids.

166
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:57,798
You will stand up and run in any direction you please,
just not this one.

167
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,564
Is that clear?
Allright, now get the fuck outta here!

168
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:06,649
Go! Run! Run!

169
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:15,736
Piece a shit kindergarten operation.

170
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,100
Fucking kids stuff.

171
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:24,986
How are the knuckles, bruiser?

172
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:29,552
- Feels fine now daddy.
- Watch out, here comes Maddie Mad Fists.

173
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:33,396
- Dad!Really?

174
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:37,960
Listen...

175
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:40,202
I'm proud you stood up for yourself.

176
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:44,047
You set boundaries with this kid.

177
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:49,892
Sounds like a motorhome. Is he snoring?

178
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:58,941
- Dad? - Yeah?
- Were you scared today?

179
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:04,306
- The truth.
- There's nothing wrong with being a little scared.

180
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,752
- Then why didn't you look scared?
- That's a practice.

181
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:14,796
- Night , Luthor.
- Dad?

182
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:18,841
- Yes?
- What do you think of Mrs. Hetch?

183
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:22,646
- She's... I'd say she's allright.
- You know what I mean.

184
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:27,251
- Yes . I know exactly what you mean.
- Good night.

185
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:46,989
Shit!

186
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:55,679
- You need to cool down.
- I need to cool down?

187
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,562
You think we're gonna be disrespected by some son of a bitch?

188
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:02,206
I ain't sayin'...
But putting your old man on the ground that ain't no  big thing.

189
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:06,330
- When he was talking to Keith...
- What the fuck? The sherrif was there?

190
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,293
I heard him say he was living at the old Griffin place.

191
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:12,536
- Fuck.
- You wanna do some things?

192
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:17,622
- What things?
- Mess with their heads, like you do everyone else.

193
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,148
Hey boss, are we good for tonight?

194
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:27,112
I'll talk to you two in a minute allright?

195
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,956
Good to see you again Cassie.

196
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:35,640
- What the hell is wrong with those two?
- Nevermind.

197
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:38,244
Fucking monkeys is what they are..

198
00:22:39,644 --> 00:22:41,846
- Hey, you look a little jumpy.
- I know.

199
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:47,013
I need something.

200
00:22:47,814 --> 00:22:50,134
Stop my stomach.

201
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:57,382
Want me to beg?

202
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:03,348
No.

203
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:17,363
You know, if I can control, you can control.

204
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,174
- I'll handle that broker thing.
- Thank you.

205
00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:13,180
Planning kids birthday parties,
it's my specialty.

206
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,623
- I'd be happy to take care of it for her.
- Thanks.

207
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:18,345
I'm not very good with these things.

208
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,507
Don't worry, I'm on it, it'll be fine.

209
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,393
She really likes you Susan.
That's a bit of a milestone I'd say.

210
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:28,235
- You think you can talk to her sometime?
- Of course.

211
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,079
Maddy used to talk to her mom for hours.

212
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:36,244
- I think she'd like to talk to a woman more often.
- I'd be happy to.

213
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:39,046
- Thanks.
- One more thing..

214
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:42,931
- People around here can say some foolish things.
- Meaning?

215
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:47,256
It's a bit like Apalachia.
Like feuds, they still exist.

216
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,980
And you 're new here .
So I just think it would be best for Maddy

217
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,263
if you would smooth everything over while still fresh in peoples minds.

218
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,706
These two kids were in a fistfight.

219
00:24:57,306 --> 00:24:59,707
You could go from two kids in a fistfight
to the emergency room that fast.

220
00:24:59,742 --> 00:25:02,150
I didn't know this town had an emergency room.

221
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:05,553
Now you're catching on.
Look, people talk.

222
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:08,478
They decided you're a question mark.

223
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:12,241
Keep it smooth, check.

224
00:25:35,264 --> 00:25:38,467
You want something around here?
I don't think so.

225
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:42,512
Look... What happened there...
I don't want more trouble.

226
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:46,276
Your kid  made the trouble.
Not ours, yours.

227
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:48,878
What do I need to do to make this go away Jimmy?

228
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,762
You?

229
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,769
I want an apology. Full apology.

230
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,132
I want you to apologize to my wife cause it's what's right

231
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:05,696
and my kid too. He saw the whole damn thing.

232
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:10,260
- I apologize for what happened.
- To them too.

233
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:11,863
To them too.

234
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:17,307
We're good now Jimmy?

235
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:22,434
Yeah allright. Go on.

236
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:25,476
It's good enough.

237
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:51,543
Go and pump your own chef, I'll be with ya in a minute.

238
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,188
Goddamn mother freezer!

239
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:15,768
There he is.

240
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,131
Let's go and get this piece a shit.

241
00:27:22,013 --> 00:27:24,096
Hey neighbour, how ya doing?

242
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,021
- Can I get that pump?
- I'm almost done.

243
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:36,027
See I need the goddamn pump right now.
You hear me?

244
00:27:38,631 --> 00:27:41,913
- Can I help y'all out hereyou ?
- No, we don't need your help.

245
00:27:42,555 --> 00:27:45,919
He's done.

246
00:27:52,244 --> 00:27:56,369
- That's 12.84 sir
- I wasn't done yet.

247
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,294
I think you are.

248
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:05,898
Whatever you're thinking, rethink it.

249
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,545
Rethink it. He wants me to rethink it.

250
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,788
You ain't turning that back on.

251
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:17,550
Shit.

252
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:25,119
You fucked up.

253
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:35,128
Why don't we stop on to the other side of the building

254
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:39,654
so I can kick your fucking ass up on over your shoulders.

255
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,562
- They from around here?
- I ain't never seen them.

256
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,728
Who put you up to this?

257
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:17,572
Nobody.

258
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:40,917
Bring that over.

259
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:45,762
Down the tubes.

260
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:54,891
Yes ?

261
00:29:56,091 --> 00:29:58,895
Fuck! How the fuck did that happen?

262
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:03,940
His fucking kid goes to my fucking nephews school.
I don't fucking know!

263
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,585
I'll deal with it. Fuck.

264
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:22,397
Daddy, what happened to your hand?

265
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:26,403
- Right there.
- Oh yeah... Uh...

266
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:31,448
Me and Teedo were trying to pull that
rusty old fence out of the ground.
You know the one behind the stable?

267
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:37,454
We won though.

268
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,477
Afternoon.
Mind stepping out for a minute?

269
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,522
You can stay in there little girl,
this won't take too long.

270
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,128
Is there a problem , sheriff?

271
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:16,052
Well, I got a report of an altercation at the filling station.
You know anything about that?

272
00:31:17,616 --> 00:31:19,618
Anybody pressing charges?

273
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:23,982
- No, nobody's pressing any charges.
- Then there's nothing worth talking about.

274
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,787
What are you, son?
Former military ?

275
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:35,154
Former military , ex law enforcment? Ex what?

276
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,477
Well, if I were ex-military sherrif,

277
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:43,281
I'd probably refer to the answer as
"need to know information".

278
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:47,165
And maybe some people don't need to know.

279
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:51,891
Here's what you need to know Broker.

280
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:56,135
You've got my attention son.

281
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,703
Get that hand looked after.

282
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,833
Are you gonna leave me behind today?

283
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:18,678
I think so .

284
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:23,602
- Making new friends at school?
- Yeah, making a lot of friends.

285
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:27,607
- I learned some cool stuff in science class.

286
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:31,209
Did you know that the trees along the river  are called cypress

287
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,494
-  And they can grow like a 100 feet.
- That's cool.

288
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,939
- Not as cool as snakes.
- Snakes?

289
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:41,900
Yeah. We got Mocassins, Copperheads, Diamondbacks...

290
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:44,424
- No King Cobras, right?

291
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:47,588
Dad, no. King Cobras are like in the Far East.

292
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:49,830
That's a relief.

293
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:58,238
- Dad?
- Yeah?

294
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,042
- Why did we move out here?
- Because there are no King Cobras .

295
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:07,248
Come on. Look at me.
Beautiful house, horse trails, river in our backyard.

296
00:33:07,928 --> 00:33:10,011
Seriously, what else could we ask for?

297
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:13,253
WiFi.

298
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:15,697
- WiFi?
- Yeah.

299
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,382
Anyone home?

300
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,948
The door is open.
Neighbour calling.

301
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:34,395
That was a tie.

302
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,360
Maybe.

303
00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:43,605
Do you know "Grace"?

304
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:48,290
- She new friend from school ?
- A new word I got from class.

305
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:52,734
"Grace".Yeah, that's a good one.

306
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,661
I think mom had that.

307
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:06,068
You have a good memory, Maddy.
She did.

308
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:10,512
The way she dressed , her smile ...

309
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:13,355
Everything about her.

310
00:34:22,284 --> 00:34:26,730
- I miss mom.
- Me too.

311
00:34:33,857 --> 00:34:37,941
I miss her so much my stomach hurts.

312
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:45,588
I get this feeling that she's worried about you.

313
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:50,192
And that she wants you to be happy.

314
00:35:01,044 --> 00:35:03,007
If you're here , I'm happy.

315
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,692
What else could I be?

316
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:07,712
- Wanna catch up?
- I find myself always trying to do that.

317
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,371
Luther!

318
00:36:47,793 --> 00:36:50,557
Easy, boy. Easy.
Easy.

319
00:37:10,255 --> 00:37:13,539
Dad?
DAD!

320
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,544
- Have you seen Luther?
- Luther?

321
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:20,426
- No, sweetie.
- I, I don't hear his bell. I'll go look.

322
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:23,630
Go back inside.
You should be getting ready for bed.

323
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,513
Don't worry, I'll find him.
Go.

324
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:34,881
- Dad, you know I can't sleep without Luther.
- I know. But I need you to try, OK?

325
00:37:37,604 --> 00:37:40,168
- I'll find him.
- And you'll find Bonnie too?

326
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:42,168
Yes. I'll find them both.

327
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:47,175
It'll be OK.

328
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:53,340
Luther!

329
00:37:54,502 --> 00:37:56,584
Luther!

330
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:05,273
Phil Broker.

331
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,870
Motherfucker.

332
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:15,805
Nice hair.

333
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:24,773
For a few years, part of the gang known as the "Outcasts". 
Motorcycle gang led by Danny Turre.

334
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,420
Holy shit.

335
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:37,225
Broker.

336
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:39,709
Very nice to meet you , agent Broker.

337
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:45,634
Luther!

338
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:48,599
Luther!
Come!

339
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:26,516
- Yeah?
- I think I got something big for us.

340
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:28,678
Big like what?

341
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:30,761
Just get over here, as soon as possible.

342
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:35,285
My shift doesn't end for another three hours, 
and I've got to drive from Shreveport.

343
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:38,569
Allright allright allright. Just make it first thing in the morning, OK?

344
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:42,013
Everything is changing.

345
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,989
Remember Jojo? Jojo Turri?

346
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,994
Danny T's boy?
Of course I do.

347
00:40:41,114 --> 00:40:43,635
- The kid was batshit.
- He was.

348
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:47,158
Until he got shot by the police 47 times.

349
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:53,366
Losing your only kid like that...
I hear Danny T is still pretty fucked up about it.

350
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:59,732
Well, they never did catch whoever snithed on Jojo and Danny T.

351
00:41:01,173 --> 00:41:05,817
- And?
- Cause it wasn't just a snitch. It was a goddamn undercover cop.

352
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,262
Read.

353
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:18,873
That guy Broker.
He's the snitch they didn't want showing up in the courtroom.

354
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:22,354
MC Dalton...that's his snitch name.

355
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:26,199
- A state narc's living in Rayville?
- Relax. Relax!

356
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,762
The thing is he's just living low here, with his daughter.

357
00:41:30,203 --> 00:41:32,365
Trust me, this is our shot.

358
00:41:34,248 --> 00:41:36,810
- Hey, how are you doing there Broker?
- Turn that off?

359
00:41:41,975 --> 00:41:44,537
Cut the bullshit.
Get right to it.

360
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:48,261
Some smalltime had him some crack, going back and forth.
Know anything about it?

361
00:41:48,982 --> 00:41:53,106
- I don't know what the hell you talking about.
- This fucking amusing to you clum? You think it's fucking funny?

362
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,032
You got your apology.
Me and my little girl are gonna be left alone in peace.

363
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:02,235
Don't escalate this any more.

364
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:07,122
- And clum, I wan't my kids cat back.
- Cat?

365
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:10,044
- I know nothing about no cat.
- Today.

366
00:42:10,763 --> 00:42:14,007
Nowhere near my place.
You understand me?

367
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,573
Good.

368
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:22,857
A lot of things have changed since you were last here.

369
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:25,180
Check it out. Got glassware, mantles,

370
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,704
 generator, exhaust system.

371
00:42:28,984 --> 00:42:31,025
Got it all going on.

372
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:33,749
Then why the fuck do we need Danny T?

373
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:36,191
We're gonna give him that rat fuck narc

374
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:39,794
in exchange for state wide distribution .

375
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:44,359
Yeah but Gator,
these  guys are fucking bikers, you can't trust them.

376
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,001
You're gonna give 'em this guy,
they're gonna turn around and they're gonna kill him.

377
00:42:47,122 --> 00:42:50,726
- And then you got nothing.
- Look, this means no more small time jobs.

378
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:54,529
No more sweatin' middle man.
All we do is cook, and get paid.

379
00:42:55,331 --> 00:42:58,613
- It's never that easy
- All you have to do

380
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:02,577
islearn a few lines and go talk to Danny T's lawyer.

381
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:07,782
- Like hell I am .
- You use them, Coming back all humble.

382
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:12,548
You're not asking for money.
You're giving Danny this guy as a gift.

383
00:43:13,028 --> 00:43:16,954
- As a favor.
- Gator, that guy is a fucking pig .

384
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,755
Just trust me.

385
00:43:22,718 --> 00:43:25,400
You're gonna get the negotiation of your life.

386
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,734
- Ready for the big day tomorrow?
- It's just a birthday .

387
00:43:38,135 --> 00:43:41,177
Hey come on, it's the tenth anniversary. It's a special one.

388
00:43:41,658 --> 00:43:43,581
I guess.

389
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:48,665
- Look what I found jumping around.
- Jumping around ?

390
00:43:48,866 --> 00:43:50,427
Yes , jumping around.

391
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:56,513
Thanks.
It's nice.

392
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:01,277
I know it's noit as good as the original,
but I though she might fill in until we find Bunny.

393
00:44:08,004 --> 00:44:11,248
You know, I was thinking,
you should have like a birthday party, with your class.

394
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:14,972
- Can Mrs. Hetch come?
- She's the one who planned it.

395
00:44:15,814 --> 00:44:18,815
- My idea , of course.
- Thanks , dad.

396
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:41,358

00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:50,928

402
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:04,823
- You wanna show me ?
- It's a little bit more important than that.

403
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:08,227
It's a gift. For Danny T.

404
00:45:19,398 --> 00:45:21,360
You've got ten minutes.

405

- Hey, a gift?

Take care of this for me.

411
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:10,930

412
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:14,454

00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,582

OK, guess that does it.

419
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:54,175
See you around Mrs. Klum.

420
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:05,786
So I heard something interesting.

421
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:09,110
Oh yeah? Something tells me you're gonna tell me what that is.

422
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:12,755
Oh just that Jimmy Klum got his ass kicked.
So did his kid.

423
00:47:13,234 --> 00:47:16,197
Fascinating. Where did you hear that?

424
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,761
Well I shoot enough pool and drink enough beer in town.
You hear a lil' bit of everything Broker.

425
00:47:21,522 --> 00:47:24,285
By the way that's old news. 
We shook and made up.

426
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,170
Is that what you think?
I got some new news for you.

427
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,652
People around here dont shake and make up.

428
00:47:31,213 --> 00:47:33,215
Never goes away that easy.

429
00:47:33,495 --> 00:47:35,817
It's old school in a feudan sense around here

430
00:47:36,057 --> 00:47:39,062
Yeah, someone broke into our house.
Is that old school?

431
00:47:39,182 --> 00:47:43,584
Yeah it is, that's called payback.
Somebody trying to scare your ass outta here, thats all. You'll be alright.

432
00:47:44,065 --> 00:47:47,069
- Jimmy Klum you mean?
- Fuck no Jimmy Klum's a bitch.

433
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:50,714
Listen I know everybody around here and Jimmy Klum's bitch ass ain't breakin into shit.

434
00:47:52,595 --> 00:47:56,040
- Now his wife brother's a whole different story.
- Who's his wifes brother?

435
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:58,521
They call him Gator for some dumb ass reason.

436
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:01,205
Lives down by the Rayville water share.

437
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,685
Fronts as a boat mechanic.
Can't fix shit.

438
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,329
But the word is he's cooking up that meth.

439
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:13,056
Hey if I were you I'd be real careful around him Broker.
He ain't true you hear me?

440
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:19,703
The sherrif know about him?

441
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:24,028
Know about him? 
Man he and sherrif Keith got it all figured out.

442
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:26,267
You see Gator snitches for Keith.

443
00:48:26,388 --> 00:48:28,592
He throws him all the small fish,
makes his job easy.

444
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:31,834
In turn the sherrif looks the other direction whenever Gator wanna cook.

445
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,077
It's some bullshit.

446
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:38,282
- Yeah thanks for the history lesson.
- Listen I grew up around these rednecks

447
00:48:38,322 --> 00:48:40,443
and I think you ought to know who you're fucking with.

448
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:47,930
Oh and in case you got any interest, 
Gator eats breakfast nearly every day at Layma's cafe, just like me.

449
00:48:49,132 --> 00:48:51,775
Now he dont look like much of nothing, but remember what I told u :

450
00:48:52,737 --> 00:48:54,500
he ain't true.

451
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,224
Crazy waiting to happen.

452
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:07,992
- Hey where are you?
- They set the meet at this fucking coffee shack at Creek Roads.

453
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:09,916
- You know I'm allergic to ths shit right?

454
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,940
Just get it done alright Sheryl.

455
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:14,557
Look at the guy they're sending, Cyrus Hanks.

456
00:49:14,638 --> 00:49:18,483
Are you fucking kiddin' me?
I know him. He's a fucking animal Gator.

457
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:24,208
- He's a fucking stone cold killer.
- Don't worry about any of that, just make it happen.

458
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:28,515
Look at you.

459
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:33,999
- Nice place Cyrus.
- Yeah well, lets just say I'm comfortble around fat people.

460
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,604
They eat the way gamblers play the slots. 
They're fucking oblivious to everything around them.

461
00:50:38,084 --> 00:50:40,646
Plus I love these fucking things.
You hungry?

462
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,089
No, I'm fine.

463
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,371
Sweetheart?
Black coffee with a little honey.

464
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:52,018
 So what's it gonna take to find this rat fuck? You know where he is yeah?

465
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:58,226
- Him and his kid.
- And to get him? You want what exactly?

466
00:51:00,587 --> 00:51:03,991
I don't want anything. He's a narc, he's a gift.

467
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,433
Oh hes a gift? He's a gift.

468
00:51:07,313 --> 00:51:10,157
Since when does a meth whore give away gifts?

469
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:15,523
I spend the last couple of years putting togther the right equipment,

470
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:18,084
 perfect partner, perfect location.

471
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:21,329
All we need is distribution, that's the main thing we're after.

472
00:51:21,568 --> 00:51:24,211
Well you got me fucking fooled Sheryl.

473
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:28,895
Cause underneath this beautiful tweaker body, 
you're a fucking genius.

474
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,063
- Where's the narc?
- Do we have a deal?

475
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:39,746
- Where is the narc?
- Do we have a deal, Cyrus?

476
00:51:45,794 --> 00:51:51,559
You got five seconds before I drill your fucking skull into this
table and then into the fucking floor, you understand?

477
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,523
Don't you fuck with me Sheryl.

478
00:51:56,205 --> 00:51:58,167
Where is the fucking narc?

479
00:52:47,577 --> 00:52:49,659
What are you doing?

480
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,464
- Cleaning.
- Cleaning?

481
00:52:55,585 --> 00:52:57,547
 It's filthy in there.

482
00:52:57,748 --> 00:53:00,991
- I'm glad you noticed.
- What are you doing here?

483
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:06,396
I came to tell you that I dealt with Broker.
The girls father.

484
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:09,560
- I want you to stay away from him.
- Hey you got something for me?

485
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:14,645
Cassie, I'm trying to tell you something. 
Do not go near Broker anymore.

486
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:18,929
- Got it.
- Okay.

487
00:53:20,972 --> 00:53:23,574
- Wow. I'm not holding so I'm sorry, can't help you.
- Not holding.

488
00:53:26,176 --> 00:53:29,460
- Well I think that's fucking bullshit.
- Cassie, why don't you just clean yourself up?

489
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:33,385
- That's fucking bullshit!
- Take a fucking shower and eat a sandwich or something.

490
00:53:33,425 --> 00:53:35,706
You take a fucking shower Gator.
Look at you!

491
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:39,110
Cassie just pull yourself together.
I'm sick of this shit.

492
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:44,236
Teddy's sleeping, if you wake him up it's gonna be like... 
This is gotta stop.

493
00:53:45,237 --> 00:53:48,679
- Don't worry I'm not making a noise. I'm leaving.
No more.

494
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:53,245
We're done. No more Cassie.

495
00:53:57,849 --> 00:54:00,132
- Hey yo Gator.

496
00:54:03,335 --> 00:54:06,659
- How's it hanging man?
- What?

497
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:12,744
- Listen man, I need a favor.
- A favor?

498
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:17,350
Fuck Jimmy you know what I heard? Keeping garbage bins is gone.

499
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,471
Man I need you to stop giving that shit to my wife.

500
00:54:21,674 --> 00:54:24,317
Alright look at her man. She's falling to pieces.

501
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:29,202
Maybe you should do a better job taking care of her.

502
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:41,733
- Were you sleeping?
- Like a baby.

503
00:54:42,694 --> 00:54:46,018
- What you got?
- Gator Bodine. I sniffed around like you asked.

504
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:48,701
A couple of arrests, no convictions.
You want details?

505
00:54:49,863 --> 00:54:52,384
- Nah don't bother.
- But there is something Broker.

506
00:54:52,744 --> 00:54:56,108
 Sheryl Marie Mott.
Ex biker cookie from Shreveport.

507
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:59,193
 Busted twice for smuggling dope into Angola.

508
00:54:59,553 --> 00:55:02,715
One of those times was to your old pal Danny T.

509
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:06,959
All of a sudden, Danny T's skank is hanging out in Rayville.

510
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:11,765
Randy. Randy send me a picture will you?

511
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:15,970
- Yeah first thing at my desk I'll email you Motts file.
- Thanks Randy.

512
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:55,730
So, this guy Cyrus. You know him?

513
00:55:56,731 --> 00:56:00,054
- Yeah I know him.
- Did you fuck him?

514
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,223
Shit.

515
00:56:13,427 --> 00:56:15,630
Fuck!

516
00:56:17,231 --> 00:56:19,273
This should be interesting.

517
00:56:19,675 --> 00:56:22,558
Yeah we've never been properly introduced, you and me.

518
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:26,441
- Is that what this is? An introduction?
- Yeah that's right.

519
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:30,846
Well I won't ask your name.
I personally believe a reputation is the most important thing.

520
00:56:32,047 --> 00:56:34,170
For some people.

521
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,573
Yeah, maybe it should be for you too, 
you've worked up a pretty bad reputation around here.

522
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:40,254
Beating up that poor kids father in front of him.

523
00:56:40,616 --> 00:56:44,540
Pissed of some of the locals.
His daughter beat up Jimmy's kid, do you believe that?

524
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:48,824
Now what kind of parent would
teach a kid to do something like that?

525
00:56:49,945 --> 00:56:53,429
- Look, I don't want anymore problems.
- OK.

526
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:59,635
Anythng else your thinking hard about, 
cause I can smell the wood burning.

527
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:02,679
If someone has an issue with me, keep it there.

528
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,801
- I don't want my kid involved.
- Involved?

529
00:57:07,563 --> 00:57:09,606
I'm a little lost.

530
00:57:11,126 --> 00:57:13,770
Well, let's get you found.

531
00:57:14,571 --> 00:57:16,532
You see the house?

532
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:19,457
 The house where we're living.

533
00:57:20,257 --> 00:57:24,141
The house that was broken into by some pathetic coward.

534
00:57:25,182 --> 00:57:29,266
Who stole a lil' girls toys, a cat. Sliced the tires.

535
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:32,789
See that's my fucking house.

536
00:57:34,711 --> 00:57:37,954
Anyone who comes around again, will find me standing in it.

537
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:41,198
OK.

538
00:57:46,684 --> 00:57:50,448
Well, I thnk your reaching.

539
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:53,771
Connecting dots that are not there.

540
00:57:55,131 --> 00:57:57,254
You're noticed Bodine.

541
00:58:00,138 --> 00:58:04,422
You should tell your little girl to be brave. 
She's got nothing to worry about with such a tough daddy around.

542
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,953
Nice meeting ya.

543
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:21,999
Finish your breakfast.

544
00:58:34,694 --> 00:58:37,616
- Fuck, what are you doing Gator?
- Fuckers making it personal.

545
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:42,140
Yeah well, we're on. 
It's happening tonight.

546
01:02:09,714 --> 01:02:11,635
Luther!

547
01:02:17,482 --> 01:02:19,684
Hey boy.

548
01:02:20,245 --> 01:02:23,127
Put the kitty down. Get up really slow.

549
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,701
Luther!

550
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:41,587
Luther.

551
01:02:43,747 --> 01:02:46,390
- Gotcha.
- Hey Broker.

552
01:02:58,763 --> 01:03:01,006
Broker.

553
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:05,810
How you doing man? Can you hear me?

554
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,814
You in there?

555
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:15,020
Can u hear me? Can you hear me now?

556
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:21,306
Bet you do.

557
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:24,631
It's a tricky thing with this rebar.
Specially the 9 gauge.

558
01:03:25,311 --> 01:03:30,395
You swing it too high, too fast, it takes your whole fucking head of man.

559
01:03:31,717 --> 01:03:34,801
- It's a very delicate operation.
- You did alright though Lou.

560
01:03:36,202 --> 01:03:39,364
Gator'd be pissed if we did something really fucking stupid.

561
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:43,370
He must be pissed of you two. Quite  a lot.

562
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:48,894
That's funny man. You're a funny guy Broker.

563
01:03:49,094 --> 01:03:51,338
You're a really funny fucking guy.

564
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:55,020
- You smartass motherfucker.
- Fucking wiseass.

565
01:03:55,782 --> 01:03:57,784
How do you like that eh?

566
01:04:00,144 --> 01:04:03,750
You know everyone had you taken for a cop,
you walk like a cop

567
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:07,114
you fight like a cop
you even smell like a fucking cop .

568
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:19,086
- Gator be here soon.
- I don't give a shit!

569
01:04:19,286 --> 01:04:23,331
I'm calling the shots.
You hear me? Hey? Can you hear me?

570
01:04:23,491 --> 01:04:27,133
Who's watching your fucking kid eh?
Who's watching your kid?

571
01:04:29,096 --> 01:04:31,778
Your girlfriend? You got a babysitter?

572
01:04:32,779 --> 01:04:37,104
Or is she at home all by herself just waiting on you

573
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:41,788
to come tuck her sorry ass in and read her a bedtime story?

574
01:04:46,754 --> 01:04:48,755
What the fuck?

575
01:04:57,004 --> 01:04:59,087
Motherfucker!

576
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:32,761
I'ma get home. I am gonna tell my girl a bedtime story.

577
01:05:33,923 --> 01:05:36,004
This is how it ends.

578
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,632
Just tell me why we're going. Why?

579
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,356
I owe you an apology I know.
But we don't have time to get into that.

580
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:09,197
- What about school?
- We will send for your records in the morning. It's fine.

581
01:06:09,478 --> 01:06:11,400
Send for? Why are we going?

582
01:06:11,521 --> 01:06:14,844
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong. They need me back in the city. It's new business.

583
01:06:14,885 --> 01:06:18,407
- They need me to review a case.
- No you said mom wanted us to live here.

584
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:23,534
-  That's what you said dad, remember?
- Yeah I did, I did, things changed honey, things changed.

585
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:27,818
 I'm sorry Maddy, I'm sorry.

586
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:31,340
You're a liar.

587
01:06:44,674 --> 01:06:47,317
- Gator.
- You must be Cyrus.

588
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:51,762
- Sheryl has told me a lot about you.
- Has she? Now that is sweet.

589
01:06:54,205 --> 01:06:56,166
Where is the fucker?

590
01:06:56,768 --> 01:06:58,850
He's about 3 miles south, route 12.

591
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:02,412
- A former plantation.
- I can draw you a map.

592
01:07:02,732 --> 01:07:07,178
- Trail. Even the inside of the house.
- Nah I don't need a fucking map. We ain't driving, Gator.

593
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:10,101
Hey, check this one out.

594
01:07:12,022 --> 01:07:14,866
What the fuck is this?
There's so many people here?

595
01:07:14,986 --> 01:07:18,590
- Is this a fucking party?
- I don't fucking know. The motherfucker just showed up with all of 'em.

596
01:07:45,497 --> 01:07:47,540
Ready to show us the way, Gator?

597
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:50,302
No, we're not going.

598
01:07:50,423 --> 01:07:53,025
- Come again?
- Look, first person they're gonna be looking for is me.

599
01:07:53,146 --> 01:07:55,788
So I'm not gonna be anywhere near the site,
I'm gonna be in a public place.

600
01:07:57,790 --> 01:08:01,594
- Guess you don't get to see me shoot the rat fuck in his mouth.
- Guess not.

601
01:08:02,876 --> 01:08:04,958
What about the kid?

602
01:08:06,278 --> 01:08:08,440
It's one stop shopping, right Gator ?

603
01:08:09,922 --> 01:08:12,724
That's right, no loose ends.

604
01:08:15,448 --> 01:08:17,889
- Shes coming with me.
- Nah that's not the deal.

605
01:08:18,009 --> 01:08:20,693
Nah she's gonna show us the way.
