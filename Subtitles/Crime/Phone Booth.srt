should be punished.

04:37:09,901 --> 04:37:11,198
Vietnam?

1057
04:37:11,269 --> 04:37:13,134
Yes, Vietnam.

1058
04:37:13,204 --> 04:37:14,603
I was too young
to go,

1059
04:37:14,673 --> 04:37:16,004
but I've seen
pictures.

1060
04:37:16,074 --> 04:37:18,008
Well, pictures
can't do it, Stu.

1061
04:37:18,076 --> 04:37:20,010
You can't imagine
the fear, the stench,

1062
04:37:20,078 --> 04:37:21,943
pigs eating
Napalm-charred bodies,

1063
04:37:22,013 --> 04:37:23,913
children leaving grenades
in your boots.

1064
04:37:23,982 --> 04:37:25,916
And you got blamed
for the war.

1065
04:37:25,984 --> 04:37:27,952
I came home,
and people spit on me.

1066
04:37:28,019 --> 04:37:29,987
This country
owes you an apology.

1067
04:37:30,055 --> 04:37:32,421
Look, I just had this
vision of you, of a kid,

1068
04:37:32,490 --> 04:37:34,458
coming back
from the war, you know?

1069
04:37:34,526 --> 04:37:35,891
Inured to the killing,

1070
04:37:35,960 --> 04:37:37,552
not able to get work,
isolated.

1071
04:37:37,629 --> 04:37:39,062
I think that
could be made into

1072
04:37:39,130 --> 04:37:40,859
a pretty affecting story

1073
04:37:40,932 --> 04:37:42,832
and, you know, one that
everyone understands.

1074
04:37:42,901 --> 04:37:43,993
And I think cops...

1075
04:37:44,069 --> 04:37:45,696
I think they're on
the side of vets.

1076
04:37:45,770 --> 04:37:47,704
[Laughing]
You are pathetic, Stu.

1077
04:37:47,772 --> 04:37:49,205
Why don't you wake up?

1078
04:37:49,274 --> 04:37:50,866
Napalm-charred bodies?

1079
04:37:50,942 --> 04:37:53,035
I'd have to be 50
to be in that war!

1080
04:37:53,111 --> 04:37:55,102
Look, stop fucking
with my head, please.

1081
04:37:55,180 --> 04:37:56,772
Cover me. I'm going
to go talk to him.

1082
04:37:56,848 --> 04:37:58,372
Shouldn't we wait on
the E.S.U. Negotiator?

1083
04:37:58,450 --> 04:37:59,712
They could take
20 minutes.

1084
04:37:59,784 --> 04:38:01,308
I'm not gonna take
a chance on this one.

1085
04:38:01,386 --> 04:38:03,320
I'm not.
I'm gonna handle this.

1086
04:38:03,388 --> 04:38:06,755
Sir! I'm taking out
my weapon.

1087
04:38:06,825 --> 04:38:09,316
Putting my weapon
down on the car.

1088
04:38:09,394 --> 04:38:11,259
Officer: The captain's going in.

1089
04:38:11,329 --> 04:38:12,455
I'm not armed.

1090
04:38:12,530 --> 04:38:13,895
Yeah, neither am I.

1091
04:38:13,965 --> 04:38:17,332
My name is Ramey.
Captain Ed Ramey.

1092
04:38:17,402 --> 04:38:18,664
What's yours?

1093
04:38:18,737 --> 04:38:19,863
Look, I don't want
to be friends.

1094
04:38:19,938 --> 04:38:21,200
I don't know,

1095
04:38:21,272 --> 04:38:23,172
it looks like you could
use a friend right now.

1096
04:38:23,241 --> 04:38:24,833
Caller: Tell him you've
already got a friend.

1097
04:38:24,909 --> 04:38:26,171
I already
got a friend, okay?

1098
04:38:26,244 --> 04:38:28,303
Is that who you're
talking to on the phone?

1099
04:38:28,380 --> 04:38:29,972
Look, I just want to hear
your side of it.

1100
04:38:30,048 --> 04:38:31,242
That's all.

1101
04:38:31,316 --> 04:38:33,682
I ain't got
no side of it.

1102
04:38:33,752 --> 04:38:35,686
And I didn't
shoot anybody.

1103
04:38:35,754 --> 04:38:37,688
You see a fucking
gun anywhere? Look.

1104
04:38:37,756 --> 04:38:39,087
Felicia: It's in
your back pocket!

1105
04:38:39,157 --> 04:38:41,625
I see it!
He been feeling it!

1106
04:38:41,693 --> 04:38:45,254
Sir, do you have
the weapon in your pocket?

1107
04:38:45,330 --> 04:38:47,821
No. I got a cell phone,
and I got cigarettes.

1108
04:38:47,899 --> 04:38:49,127
I got no fucking weapon.

1109
04:38:49,200 --> 04:38:50,565
Okay. Then what
are you doing

1110
04:38:50,635 --> 04:38:52,034
in a phone booth
making calls?

1111
04:38:52,103 --> 04:38:54,094
Look, you want
to see it? Here...

1112
04:38:54,172 --> 04:38:55,935
Hey! Don't reach
for that!

1113
04:38:56,007 --> 04:38:57,565
- Hold your fire!
- Jesus.

1114
04:38:57,642 --> 04:38:59,166
I don't need
to see it.

1115
04:38:59,244 --> 04:39:00,575
I already know
it's there.

1116
04:39:00,645 --> 04:39:01,976
I got plenty
of witnesses over here

1117
04:39:02,046 --> 04:39:03,411
who saw you use it.

1118
04:39:03,481 --> 04:39:05,506
Look, they didn't see it
because it didn't happen!

1119
04:39:05,583 --> 04:39:06,777
Shut them up!

1120
04:39:06,851 --> 04:39:09,115
He's dead,
but it didn't happen.

1121
04:39:09,187 --> 04:39:10,745
Then who did it?

1122
04:39:10,822 --> 04:39:12,449
Caller:
Mustn't tell him, Stu.

1123
04:39:12,524 --> 04:39:13,957
I don't know.

1124
04:39:14,025 --> 04:39:15,617
Hey, you were
the closest one to him.

1125
04:39:15,693 --> 04:39:16,955
You must've saw it happen.

1126
04:39:17,028 --> 04:39:18,290
Come on,
help me out here.

1127
04:39:18,363 --> 04:39:20,126
Caller: This guy is
getting on my nerves.

1128
04:39:20,198 --> 04:39:21,631
Look, stay the fuck
out of this.

1129
04:39:21,699 --> 04:39:23,758
Who do you keep
talking to on the phone?

1130
04:39:23,835 --> 04:39:25,166
Nobody.

1131
04:39:25,236 --> 04:39:27,966
Your friend, your parent,
your lover... who?

1132
04:39:28,039 --> 04:39:30,337
Caller: Careful, Stuart, careful.

1133
04:39:30,408 --> 04:39:31,841
My psychiatrist.

1134
04:39:31,910 --> 04:39:33,844
[Caller, Laughing] Excellent.

1135
04:39:33,912 --> 04:39:35,345
I should have
thought of that.

1136
04:39:35,413 --> 04:39:37,608
I see. What's this
doctor's name?

1137
04:39:37,682 --> 04:39:39,650
It would be really helpful
to us if we knew that.

1138
04:39:39,717 --> 04:39:41,776
He says
not to tell you.

1139
04:39:41,853 --> 04:39:43,684
It's privileged
information.

1140
04:39:43,755 --> 04:39:46,121
Very good, Stuart.
See, now you're having fun.

1141
04:39:46,191 --> 04:39:47,624
Yeah, whatever
you fucking say.

1142
04:39:47,692 --> 04:39:49,751
Ramey: I respect your
right to privacy.

1143
04:39:49,828 --> 04:39:51,352
I've been through
therapy myself.

1144
04:39:51,429 --> 04:39:53,021
The department...
they provided it for me.

1145
04:39:53,097 --> 04:39:55,657
I know it's not good form
for a cop to be saying that,

1146
04:39:55,733 --> 04:39:57,997
but you know, sometimes,
hey, the circumstances...

1147
04:39:58,069 --> 04:39:59,764
Stress... I had issues.

1148
04:39:59,838 --> 04:40:01,396
I lost my marriage
over it.

1149
04:40:01,473 --> 04:40:04,237
Caller: Tell him not to come
any closer.

1150
04:40:04,309 --> 04:40:05,776
Stu: Look, don't come
any closer.

1151
04:40:05,844 --> 04:40:07,471
Stop right there.
Go back a few steps.

1152
04:40:07,545 --> 04:40:09,137
Go back
to where you were.

1153
04:40:09,214 --> 04:40:10,647
Okay, okay.
Hey, no problem.

1154
04:40:10,715 --> 04:40:13,479
So you got some
intimacy issues.

1155
04:40:13,551 --> 04:40:14,984
I got those, too.

1156
04:40:15,053 --> 04:40:17,647
All I want to know is,
what happened, man?

1157
04:40:17,722 --> 04:40:19,519
Caller: Tell him to read you
your rights.

1158
04:40:19,591 --> 04:40:21,752
I want you to
read me my rights.

1159
04:40:21,826 --> 04:40:23,589
And stop asking
questions.

1160
04:40:23,661 --> 04:40:25,561
You have the right
to remain silent.

1161
04:40:25,630 --> 04:40:27,359
You have the right
to an attorney.

1162
04:40:27,432 --> 04:40:28,694
If you cannot afford one,

1163
04:40:28,766 --> 04:40:30,290
an attorney will be
provided for you.

1164
04:40:30,368 --> 04:40:32,131
All right?

1165
04:40:32,203 --> 04:40:34,831
So now, can you at least
give me your first name?

1166
04:40:34,906 --> 04:40:36,032
Just your first name.

1167
04:40:36,107 --> 04:40:37,335
Caller: Don't tell him.

1168
04:40:37,408 --> 04:40:39,171
It's my right not to
have any first name.

1169
04:40:39,244 --> 04:40:40,836
[Caller Laughing]

1170
04:40:40,912 --> 04:40:41,844
Ramey: No gun, no name.

1171
04:40:41,913 --> 04:40:43,005
Stu: That's right.

1172
04:40:43,081 --> 04:40:45,174
You're a highly
underprivileged person, sir.

1173
04:40:45,250 --> 04:40:46,842
Caller: Demand your lawyer.

1174
04:40:46,918 --> 04:40:48,852
And go get
my lawyer, too.

1175
04:40:48,920 --> 04:40:50,945
I want an attorney
brought down here

1176
04:40:51,022 --> 04:40:52,284
to negotiate
my surrender.

1177
04:40:52,357 --> 04:40:53,619
Caller: Just brilliant, Stu.

1178
04:40:53,691 --> 04:40:54,783
I understand that,
but, uh,

1179
04:40:54,859 --> 04:40:56,121
it's gonna be
very difficult

1180
04:40:56,194 --> 04:40:57,456
to get a lawyer
to come down here

1181
04:40:57,529 --> 04:40:58,553
and risk his life,

1182
04:40:58,630 --> 04:40:59,790
but once you
hand over the gun...

1183
04:40:59,864 --> 04:41:01,525
How can I hand over
the fucking weapon when

1184
04:41:01,599 --> 04:41:03,191
you won't let me put
my hand in my pocket?

1185
04:41:03,268 --> 04:41:04,860
Oh, no, we'll
take it out for you.

1186
04:41:04,936 --> 04:41:07,302
All you have to do is just
step out of the booth

1187
04:41:07,372 --> 04:41:09,567
with your hands raised...
nothing will happen to you.

1188
04:41:09,641 --> 04:41:11,302
It's not gonna work.

1189
04:41:11,376 --> 04:41:12,502
Caller: Stu, Stu, please.

1190
04:41:12,577 --> 04:41:13,601
What?

1191
04:41:13,678 --> 04:41:15,111
Ask him a question for me.

1192
04:41:15,179 --> 04:41:17,477
Ask him if his wife got
tired of sleeping with him?

1193
04:41:17,549 --> 04:41:19,210
I, uh... fuck.

1194
04:41:19,284 --> 04:41:20,751
I can't do that.

1195
04:41:20,818 --> 04:41:22,080
Oh, sure you can, Stu.

1196
04:41:22,153 --> 04:41:23,677
Ask him if
he couldn't get it up,

1197
04:41:23,755 --> 04:41:25,017
if he couldn't
satisfy her.

1198
04:41:25,089 --> 04:41:27,148
Sir, are you going
to step out of the booth?

1199
04:41:27,225 --> 04:41:28,852
- I can't... No.
- Ramey: Is that a "no"?

1200
04:41:28,927 --> 04:41:30,519
You're not stepping out
of the booth?

1201
04:41:30,595 --> 04:41:31,619
Caller: Ask him.

1202
04:41:31,696 --> 04:41:32,924
Is that a "no"?

1203
04:41:32,997 --> 04:41:33,986
Caller: Ask him!

1204
04:41:35,567 --> 04:41:37,364
Both your lives
depend on it.

1205
04:41:37,435 --> 04:41:38,527
Sir?

1206
04:41:38,603 --> 04:41:41,868
Captain, you, uh,

1207
04:41:41,940 --> 04:41:44,204
you couldn't satisfy
your wife sexually?

1208
04:41:44,275 --> 04:41:46,470
[Caller Laughing]

1209
04:41:48,513 --> 04:41:49,673
Excuse me?

1210
04:41:49,747 --> 04:41:51,772
Caller: Ask him if he abuses himself
now that she's gone.

1211
04:41:51,849 --> 04:41:53,646
Does he masturbate
on those lonely nights?

1212
04:41:53,718 --> 04:41:54,844
For God's sake!

1213
04:41:54,919 --> 04:41:56,546
Caller: Say it!

1214
04:41:56,621 --> 04:41:59,454
Say it or I will
blow him away!

1215
04:41:59,524 --> 04:42:01,355
[Gun Cocking]

1216
04:42:01,426 --> 04:42:03,792
So do you
wack off now?

1217
04:42:03,861 --> 04:42:04,828
Hey!

1218
04:42:04,896 --> 04:42:07,057
[Caller Laughing]

1219
04:42:09,267 --> 04:42:12,361
I'm going to see about
that lawyer for you, okay?

1220
04:42:12,437 --> 04:42:13,734
Yes.

1221
04:42:13,805 --> 04:42:15,238
Just relax.

1222
04:42:16,908 --> 04:42:19,741
Caller: Stu, I think
you hurt his feelings.

1223
04:42:19,811 --> 04:42:21,608
I want to know who he's
on that phone with.

1224
04:42:21,679 --> 04:42:22,805
I want a techie here.

1225
04:42:22,880 --> 04:42:25,747
I need to talk to somebody
about that phone.

1226
04:42:25,817 --> 04:42:27,751
Caller: Do you think we went
too far, Stuart?

1227
04:42:27,819 --> 04:42:29,514
Should we
give ourselves up?

1228
04:42:29,587 --> 04:42:30,849
You know,
maybe I'd like someone

1229
04:42:30,922 --> 04:42:32,253
to negotiate
my surrender, too.

1230
04:42:32,323 --> 04:42:33,756
Look, I'm sure we
can work that out.

1231
04:42:33,825 --> 04:42:35,759
Well, I don't want to just
spill my guts to anyone.

1232
04:42:35,827 --> 04:42:37,317
Could you get me
national news?

1233
04:42:37,395 --> 04:42:39,329
I mean, you've got
connections, right?

1234
04:42:39,397 --> 04:42:40,523
Sure.

1235
04:42:40,598 --> 04:42:42,657
Larry King? Could you get
Larry King down here?

1236
04:42:42,734 --> 04:42:44,326
Larry... why the fuck
would Larry King

1237
04:42:44,402 --> 04:42:45,334
come down here?

1238
04:42:45,403 --> 04:42:46,335
Because you're friends.

1239
04:42:46,404 --> 04:42:47,996
Who else
could you get, huh?

1240
04:42:48,072 --> 04:42:49,835
Could you get
Tom Brokaw?

1241
04:42:49,907 --> 04:42:51,841
How 'bout Dan Rather?
Diane Sawyer?

1242
04:42:51,909 --> 04:42:53,843
Look, l... I don't know.
They're busy.

1243
04:42:53,911 --> 04:42:55,401
"I... I... I... busy."

1244
04:42:55,480 --> 04:42:57,345
How 'bout Mike Wallace,
Ted Koppel?

Katie Couric,

Al Roker, anybody?

1247
04:43:00,385 --> 04:43:02,182
Nah! Nobody.

1248
04:43:02,253 --> 04:43:04,721
Face it, Stu,
you're small-time,

1249
04:43:04,789 --> 04:43:06,848
and you've got
a credibility problem.

1250
04:43:06,924 --> 04:43:08,186
Listen,
don't fucking worry

1251
04:43:08,259 --> 04:43:09,590
about my credibility,
all right?

1252
04:43:09,661 --> 04:43:10,923
What about yours?

04:43:14,966 --> 04:43:16,661
You're local news,
Stuart.

1256
04:43:16,734 --> 04:43:18,861
You could never do this
for any of your clients,

1257
04:43:18,936 --> 04:43:20,528
not if your life
depended on it,

1258
04:43:20,605 --> 04:43:22,436
but me,
I've made you famous.

1259
04:43:22,507 --> 04:43:23,872
Stick your head out
a little

1260
04:43:23,941 --> 04:43:25,533
so they can get
a better angle on you.

1261
04:43:25,610 --> 04:43:27,043
They're here
for coverage of me

1262

Caller: How ungrateful.

1264
04:43:29,447 --> 04:43:30,880
Those cameras
will make the police

1265
04:43:30,948 --> 04:43:32,540
very careful, Stuart,
so come on,

1266
04:43:32,617 --> 04:43:33,982
smile a little for them.

1267
04:43:34,052 --> 04:43:35,644
Can you tap into
that phone call?

1268
04:43:35,720 --> 04:43:36,948
Should be no problem.

1269
04:43:37,021 --> 04:43:38,454
Except we'll need
a warrant

1270
04:43:38,523 --> 04:43:40,115
if he's on the line
with his shrink.

1271
04:43:40,191 --> 04:43:42,386
Fuck that, I'm not
gonna jeopardize this

1272
04:43:42,460 --> 04:43:43,893
on a technicality.

1273
04:43:43,961 --> 04:43:45,223
Look, tracing...

1274
04:43:45,296 --> 04:43:47,059
That's not
a violation, right?

1275
04:43:47,131 --> 04:43:48,359
As long as we
don't listen in.

1276
04:43:48,433 --> 04:43:50,128
Okay, this is what
I want you to do.

1277
04:43:50,201 --> 04:43:51,930
I want you to find out
who he's talking to

1278
04:43:52,003 --> 04:43:53,402
and their current
location.

1279
04:43:53,471 --> 04:43:54,403
All right.

1280
04:43:54,472 --> 04:43:55,564
We get that,

1281
04:43:55,640 --> 04:43:57,073
I want somebody
to get over there

1282

and see what everybody
in New York is looking at.

04:44:02,447 --> 04:44:04,347
You're the man, Stuart.

You're the center
of attention.

goes national.

04:44:10,655 --> 04:44:13,488
You're gonna hit
the whole alphabet, Stu.

1290
04:44:13,558 --> 04:44:14,855
Listen, I'll be
forgotten about

1291

in a week.

1292
04:44:16,094 --> 04:44:18,028
No one ever remembers
the name of the victims.

1293
04:44:18,096 --> 04:44:19,358
It's the killers
that get the cover

1294

of <i>Time</i> magazine.

1295
04:44:20,932 --> 04:44:22,866
All right?
Think about it.

1296
04:44:22,934 --> 04:44:24,367
You'd be famous.

Name a victim.
You can't.

1300
04:44:29,574 --> 04:44:30,939
And anyway,
I don't deserve to be

1301
04:44:31,008 --> 04:44:32,270
the center of attention.

1302
04:44:32,343 --> 04:44:33,776
It ought to be you
they're covering.

1303
04:44:33,845 --> 04:44:35,779
No, all that attention
would embarrass me.

1304
04:44:35,847 --> 04:44:37,678
I know exactly the spin
to put on this.

1305
04:44:37,749 --> 04:44:39,683
How your terror inspires
your creativity?

1306
04:44:39,751 --> 04:44:41,378
This could be
a media frenzy.

1307
04:44:41,452 --> 04:44:43,420
All right, you'd get
Barbara Walters,

1308
04:44:43,488 --> 04:44:45,820
Larry King... if you
still wanted him.

1309
04:44:45,890 --> 04:44:47,881
See, that approach
seems predicated

1310
04:44:47,959 --> 04:44:50,393
upon me surrendering myself
without killing you.

1311
04:44:50,461 --> 04:44:52,053
No.

1312

make you sympathetic.

because he was gonna
kill me.

1318
04:45:04,408 --> 04:45:06,501
You killed Leon
to protect me.

1319
04:45:06,577 --> 04:45:08,841
All right? Now,
in a city where nobody

1320
04:45:08,913 --> 04:45:10,676
looks out for anybody,
you took a stand.

1321
04:45:10,748 --> 04:45:12,340
I'm your best witness
to that.

1322
04:45:12,416 --> 04:45:15,317
So you want me to trust you
to get me out of this?

1323
04:45:15,386 --> 04:45:17,183
Y-Yes, I do.
I want you to trust me.

1324
04:45:17,255 --> 04:45:18,517

of him.

Hey, you should've
waited for me

1329
04:45:38,943 --> 04:45:40,877
to initiate contact
with the suspect.

1330
04:45:40,945 --> 04:45:42,310
I already established
some rapport with him.

1331
04:45:42,380 --> 04:45:43,711
I'll let you know
if I need any help, okay?

1332

What, are you grandstanding
for these TV cameras?

1333
04:45:45,249 --> 04:45:47,683
You want to leave this
to a professional.

gets here,

he was in therapy.

It kept me from
picking up a gun,

1404
04:47:55,433 --> 04:47:56,923

would've regretted.

Look, Stu didn't
kill anyone.

1406

Ma'am,
under the circumstances,

1407
04:48:00,504 --> 04:48:02,267
you need to consider
whether your husband

1408
04:48:02,339 --> 04:48:04,204
is exactly who
you thought he was,

1409
04:48:04,275 --> 04:48:05,765
because according
to these witnesses

1410
04:48:05,843 --> 04:48:07,276
right over here,
he has a gun,

1411
04:48:07,344 --> 04:48:08,538
he has used that gun,

1412
04:48:08,612 --> 04:48:11,046
and let's pray to God
that he doesn't use it again.

1413

the first floor of the City Hotel.

within 10 feet of the booth.

securing rooftop positions.

Okay, let me know when
you're in position.

No. We're working on it

04:53:19,656 --> 04:53:21,590
Just tell me what
the fuck you want from me.

1569
04:53:21,658 --> 04:53:22,920
Anything you want.

1570
04:53:22,993 --> 04:53:25,484
Oh. Hello.
There you are.

1571
04:53:25,562 --> 04:53:27,086
I thought I was talkin'
to myself again.

1572
04:53:27,164 --> 04:53:29,496
Anything you want,
I'll do it. Just tell me.

1573
04:53:29,566 --> 04:53:32,126
Tell Kelly
about the real Stu,

1574
04:53:32,202 --> 04:53:33,999
about your little motel.

1575
04:53:35,406 --> 04:53:37,169
And then
you'll let us go?

1576
04:53:37,241 --> 04:53:38,333
Why not?

1577
04:53:42,679 --> 04:53:43,611
Kelly?!

1578
04:53:43,680 --> 04:53:44,977
That's a start.

1579
04:53:45,048 --> 04:53:45,980
Baby?

1580
04:53:46,049 --> 04:53:47,346
- Ramey: Hold her back!
- Officer: Hey!

1581
04:53:47,418 --> 04:53:48,350
I want you
to talk to me!

1582
04:53:48,419 --> 04:53:49,351
- Ramey: Keep her back!
- Yes?

1583
04:53:49,420 --> 04:53:50,580
- Keep her back!
- Grab her!

1584
04:53:50,654 --> 04:53:52,019
I'm listening!

1585
04:53:53,424 --> 04:53:55,085
Kelly, I called
some woman.

1586
04:53:56,260 --> 04:53:58,228
Caller: Every... day.

1587
04:53:58,295 --> 04:54:00,889
Every day. L... I was attracted
to this other woman.

1588
04:54:00,964 --> 04:54:02,124
I called her, and...

1589
04:54:03,534 --> 04:54:06,298
Caller: I wanted
to fuck her.

1590
04:54:06,370 --> 04:54:08,167
And I wanted
to sleep with her.

1591
04:54:10,507 --> 04:54:11,906
No...

1592
04:54:11,975 --> 04:54:13,408
I wanted...

1593
04:54:13,477 --> 04:54:15,308
to fuck... her.

1594
04:54:18,549 --> 04:54:19,481
Say it.

1595
04:54:20,884 --> 04:54:22,146
Say it!

1596
04:54:22,219 --> 04:54:24,813
And I wanted
to fuck her.

1597
04:54:24,888 --> 04:54:25,877
I'm sorry.

1598
04:54:25,956 --> 04:54:29,653
Whatever you did...
I don't care.

1599
04:54:31,061 --> 04:54:32,289
Please... just...

1600
04:54:32,362 --> 04:54:34,353
come out
of the booth. Okay?

1601
04:54:34,431 --> 04:54:35,989
That's all I did.

1602
04:54:36,066 --> 04:54:37,829
That's all I did.
I'm sorry.

1603
04:54:41,438 --> 04:54:43,599
All right, look, l... I've
done what you asked.

1604
04:54:43,674 --> 04:54:45,699
That's it. I've had
enough of this game.

1605
04:54:45,776 --> 04:54:47,471
<i>I</i> haven't.

1606
04:54:47,544 --> 04:54:49,671
You said
you'd let us go.

1607
04:54:49,746 --> 04:54:51,509
I changed my mind.

1608
04:54:53,417 --> 04:54:54,907
You miserable fuck.

1609
04:54:54,985 --> 04:54:56,646
You can't do this!
You can't do this to me!

1610
04:54:56,720 --> 04:54:57,982
Look, I took
all your shit!

1611
04:54:58,055 --> 04:54:59,545
I did everything
you fuckin' asked!

1612
04:54:59,623 --> 04:55:00,647
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1613
04:55:00,724 --> 04:55:01,952
You lied to me. Now
I'm done with this game.

1614
04:55:02,025 --> 04:55:03,754
I've fuckin' had enough.
You go fuck yourself.

1615
04:55:03,827 --> 04:55:04,759
- Later.
- Ha ha ha...

1616
04:55:06,430 --> 04:55:07,624
He hung up.

1617
04:55:07,698 --> 04:55:08,960
Maybe they already
got a trace.

1618
04:55:09,032 --> 04:55:10,260
E.S.U.

1620
04:55:15,405 --> 04:55:16,531
I'm givin'
myself up!

1621
04:55:16,607 --> 04:55:18,268
- First the gun!
- Heads up!

1622
04:55:18,342 --> 04:55:19,934
I want to see you
toss away your weapon!

1623
04:55:20,010 --> 04:55:21,739
Throw the weapon
outside the booth!

1624
04:55:21,812 --> 04:55:22,972
You stay
where you are!

1625
04:55:23,046 --> 04:55:24,308
Hey! First...

1626
04:55:24,381 --> 04:55:26,372
Don't hurt him!
Please don't hurt him!

1627
04:55:26,450 --> 04:55:27,815
There is
no fucking gun!

1628
04:55:27,885 --> 04:55:29,443
You stay right
where you are!

1629
04:55:29,520 --> 04:55:31,681
I want you to turn
around, interlock

1630
04:55:31,755 --> 04:55:33,188
your fingers
behind your head.

1631

04:55:35,692 --> 04:55:38,126
Please! Give them
the gun!

04:55:38,195 --> 04:55:39,526
Kelly, no!

1635
04:55:39,596 --> 04:55:42,224
Get back!
Kelly!

1636
04:55:42,299 --> 04:55:43,960
Hey!
Back her up!

1637
04:55:44,034 --> 04:55:44,966
Freeze!

1638
04:55:45,035 --> 04:55:46,832
Get back!
Get back!

1639
04:55:46,904 --> 04:55:48,064

1640
04:55:48,138 --> 04:55:49,070

1642
04:55:50,741 --> 04:55:52,299
I gotta answer it.

1643
04:55:52,376 --> 04:55:53,308
Freeze!

1644
04:55:53,377 --> 04:55:54,366
Don't move.

04:56:09,826 --> 04:56:11,555
Go ahead.
Answer it.

04:56:11,628 --> 04:56:12,890
Whoa, whoa! What
the fuck are you doin'?!

1654
04:56:12,963 --> 04:56:13,895

1656
04:56:14,965 --> 04:56:16,796

Stu: You fuckin' coward.

1659
04:56:22,839 --> 04:56:24,306
Caller: Hi, Stu.

1660
04:56:24,374 --> 04:56:26,968
Now... you've had
your little tantrum.

1661
04:56:27,044 --> 04:56:28,807
And you said
some things in anger

1662
04:56:28,879 --> 04:56:30,833
that I am willing
to forget.

1663
04:56:32,134 --> 04:56:33,260
Get her back
in the car!

1664
04:56:33,335 --> 04:56:34,768
You're acting like he's
not the fuckin' perp.

1665
04:56:34,837 --> 04:56:37,169
If he's not the shooter,
who the fuck is, huh?!

1666
04:56:41,310 --> 04:56:42,402
Captain, what
the fuck is up

1667
04:56:42,478 --> 04:56:43,775
with the phone
calls, man?

1668
04:56:43,846 --> 04:56:44,972
Caller:
So, can we start over?

1669
04:56:45,047 --> 04:56:46,036
You lied.

1670
04:56:46,115 --> 04:56:47,480
Caller: Well, you can't know
the pain of betrayal

1671
04:56:47,549 --> 04:56:49,039
until you've been
betrayed.

1672
04:56:49,118 --> 04:56:50,380
Sniper up in one
of these buildings,

1673
04:56:50,452 --> 04:56:52,044
so I want you to
talk to E.S.U.

1674
04:56:52,121 --> 04:56:53,520
I want you to get one of
these guys over here...

1675
04:56:53,589 --> 04:56:54,749
This building.

1676
04:56:54,823 --> 04:56:57,348
Start looking up here from
window to window to window

1677
04:56:57,426 --> 04:56:59,291
until you find
the perp, okay?

1678
04:56:59,361 --> 04:57:00,851
I want you
to do it quickly.

1679
04:57:00,929 --> 04:57:02,191
I want you to do it
quietly. All right?

1680
04:57:02,264 --> 04:57:03,196
All right.

1681
04:57:04,533 --> 04:57:06,797
Yo, where's
the E.S.U. Sergeant?

1682
04:57:07,035 --> 04:57:08,559
You said we could go.

1683
04:57:08,637 --> 04:57:09,569
You said
you'd let us go.

1684
04:57:09,638 --> 04:57:11,071
Caller: Relax, Stuart.

1685
04:57:11,140 --> 04:57:13,267
Nobody gets it right
the first time.

1686
04:57:13,342 --> 04:57:14,570
You've done much better
than the others,

1687
04:57:14,643 --> 04:57:16,543
and you will get
another chance to end this.

1688
04:57:16,612 --> 04:57:18,375
I'm just not finished yet.

1689
04:57:18,447 --> 04:57:19,379
Yeah, well, I am.

1690
04:57:19,448 --> 04:57:20,415
There's nothing
keeping me here.

1691
04:57:20,482 --> 04:57:21,949
You mean
besides the fear of death?

1692
04:57:22,017 --> 04:57:23,416
Look, I dive out now,
you got one shot,

1693
04:57:23,485 --> 04:57:24,509
and I'm gonna be
fuckin' dancing.

1694
04:57:24,586 --> 04:57:25,575
You think
you can get me?

1695
04:57:25,654 --> 04:57:28,214
Well, I could go
for some target practice.

1696
04:57:28,290 --> 04:57:29,382
One shot, they'll be
looking for you.

1697
04:57:29,458 --> 04:57:30,789
A second shot, you'd
give yourself away.

1698
04:57:30,859 --> 04:57:32,554
Go on, Stuart.
Hang up.

1699
04:57:32,628 --> 04:57:34,823
Trust your fate to
the friendly men in flak jackets

1700
04:57:34,897 --> 04:57:36,159
with automatic weapons.

1701
04:57:36,231 --> 04:57:38,859
I'm sure you can patch up
that little misunderstanding

1702
04:57:38,934 --> 04:57:40,629
about the dead body.

1703
04:57:40,702 --> 04:57:41,999
The cops can't prove
I killed anyone.

1704
04:57:42,070 --> 04:57:43,162
You had motive.

1705
04:57:43,238 --> 04:57:44,170
No weapon.

1706
04:57:44,239 --> 04:57:46,139
Plenty of
loud-mouth witnesses.

1707
04:57:46,208 --> 04:57:47,175
No gun,
and I walk.

1708
04:57:47,242 --> 04:57:48,174
Are you sure?

1709
04:57:48,243 --> 04:57:49,403
Yes!

1710
04:57:49,478 --> 04:57:51,776
Yeah.
You murder a guy,

1711
04:57:51,847 --> 04:57:53,815
and you forget where
you stashed your gun.

1712
04:57:53,882 --> 04:57:55,816
Why don't you lift
the plastic ceiling panel

1713
04:57:55,884 --> 04:57:57,010
and feel around?

1714
04:57:57,085 --> 04:57:59,280
[Gasps]

1715
04:57:59,354 --> 04:58:00,548
Peekaboo.

1716
04:58:07,095 --> 04:58:08,153
What's up next to
the Florescent bulb?

1717
04:58:08,230 --> 04:58:10,095
Check it out, Stu.

1718
04:58:10,165 --> 04:58:11,757
Cops see me reach
for something,

1719
04:58:11,834 --> 04:58:13,131
and they'll
blow me away.

1720
04:58:13,202 --> 04:58:14,794
Caller: There's only
one way to find out.

1721
04:58:14,870 --> 04:58:17,498
Look, the slugs
from that dead guy,

1722
04:58:17,573 --> 04:58:18,904
they came from
your rifle.

1723
04:58:18,974 --> 04:58:20,100
They're not gonna
match any handgun.

1724
04:58:20,175 --> 04:58:21,733
I've seen enough cop
shows to know that.

1725
04:58:21,810 --> 04:58:23,710
Hollow points
fragment on impact, Stuart.

1726
04:58:23,779 --> 04:58:25,337
There's nothing to match.

1727
04:58:25,414 --> 04:58:27,006
Stu: Only there's no gun
up there.

1728
04:58:27,082 --> 04:58:30,051
Caller: Don't take my word for it.
See for yourself.

1729
04:58:30,118 --> 04:58:32,313
There are rounds left
in it.

1730
04:58:32,387 --> 04:58:33,684
I totally couldn't
give a shit.

1731
04:58:33,755 --> 04:58:35,347
Come on, Stuart.
Don't disappoint me!

1732
04:58:35,424 --> 04:58:36,789
Use your imagination.
You'd shoot me

1733
04:58:36,859 --> 04:58:37,791
if you got the chance,
wouldn't you?

1734
04:58:37,860 --> 04:58:39,157
[Laughs]

1735
04:58:39,228 --> 04:58:41,253
With a big fuckin' smile
on my face.

[Caller Laughs]

1737
04:58:42,564 --> 04:58:45,055
There's the spirit.

1738
04:58:45,133 --> 04:58:46,191
Now, what if I told you

1739
04:58:46,268 --> 04:58:48,896
I was just above the theater,
4 floors up?

1740
04:58:48,971 --> 04:58:51,769
See the pink curtains?

1741
04:58:51,840 --> 04:58:54,104
There you go, Stuart.
Yes.

1742
04:58:54,176 --> 04:58:56,371
Yoo-hoo.

1743
04:58:56,445 --> 04:58:57,377
Yoo-hoo.

1744
04:58:58,814 --> 04:59:02,511
[Caller Chuckles]

1745
04:59:02,584 --> 04:59:04,711
Why would you do that?

1746
04:59:04,786 --> 04:59:07,414
Because it's fun.

1747
04:59:07,489 --> 04:59:09,389
The odds are even now,
Stuart.

1748
04:59:09,458 --> 04:59:11,426
Isn't that what you wanted?

1749
04:59:11,493 --> 04:59:14,291
You know where I am,
and you have a gun.

1750
04:59:14,363 --> 04:59:17,594
If you have it in you,
you can take me down.

1751
04:59:20,802 --> 04:59:22,963
Fuck.
They'd kill me

1752
04:59:23,038 --> 04:59:24,505
before I got off
a shot, you...

1753
04:59:24,573 --> 04:59:26,666
Caller: Aw, you're probably right.

1754
04:59:26,742 --> 04:59:28,232
I'm not really there anyway.

1755
04:59:28,310 --> 04:59:31,040
You would've just spoiled
some nice lady's curtains.

1756
04:59:35,951 --> 04:59:39,216
Looks like someone
watches the news.

1757
04:59:39,288 --> 04:59:40,812
[Caller Chuckles]

1758
04:59:40,889 --> 04:59:41,821
Stu: Who?

1759
04:59:41,890 --> 04:59:44,358
Caller: The motel.

1760
04:59:46,528 --> 04:59:47,460
Oh, God.

1761
04:59:47,529 --> 04:59:48,723
I think she could use
a new head shot.

1762
04:59:48,797 --> 04:59:49,729
Don't!

1763
04:59:49,798 --> 04:59:51,698
Then take down the gun!

1764
04:59:51,767 --> 04:59:53,462
But this has nothing
to do with her.

1765
04:59:53,535 --> 04:59:55,730
She has everything
to do with this, Stuart.

1766
04:59:55,804 --> 04:59:57,203
You're here
because you called her.

1767
04:59:57,272 --> 04:59:58,796
She's here
because you called her.

1768
04:59:58,874 --> 05:00:00,136
Now, take it down!

1769
05:00:01,677 --> 05:00:02,939
Don't make me
hurt Pam, Stuart.

1770
05:00:03,011 --> 05:00:04,774
Take down the gun.

1771
05:00:04,846 --> 05:00:06,473
Sgt. Cole:
Everybody get ready.

1772
05:00:06,548 --> 05:00:07,572
Hold on. Let's just see
what he does, all right?

1773
05:00:07,649 --> 05:00:09,879
Let's just see what
he's doing. Hold on.

1774
05:00:14,089 --> 05:00:15,078
There's nothing there.

1775
05:00:15,157 --> 05:00:16,784
Caller: Nothing
but your fingerprints

1776
05:00:16,858 --> 05:00:19,588
on the finest cop-killer
money can buy.

1777
05:00:19,661 --> 05:00:20,992
Come on, Stu.

1778
05:00:21,063 --> 05:00:22,189
Let's see it.

1779
05:00:22,264 --> 05:00:23,891
Fuck, no.
It's staying there.

1780
05:00:23,966 --> 05:00:26,594
Fine, then someone will
have to take your place.

1781
05:00:26,668 --> 05:00:28,568
Come on, Stu! You're in
a perfect position!

1782
05:00:28,637 --> 05:00:29,569
How do you
figure?

1783
05:00:29,638 --> 05:00:30,696
You get to choose
between them...

1784
05:00:30,772 --> 05:00:32,569
Pamela or Kelly,
or should I choose for you?

1785
05:00:32,641 --> 05:00:36,270
One of them
can take your place.

1786
05:00:36,345 --> 05:00:38,006
Don't do this!

1787
05:00:38,080 --> 05:00:39,104
Stuart,
you've got to be

1788
05:00:39,181 --> 05:00:40,307
more in touch
with your feelings.

1789
05:00:40,382 --> 05:00:41,974
I thought
you only loved Kelly.

1790
05:00:42,050 --> 05:00:42,982
It's true.

1791
05:00:43,051 --> 05:00:44,279
But you lie to her.

1792
05:00:44,353 --> 05:00:45,843
It... It's complicated.

1793
05:00:45,921 --> 05:00:47,252
Then I'll uncomplicate it,
Stuart,

1794
05:00:47,322 --> 05:00:48,254
by removing temptation!

1795
05:00:48,323 --> 05:00:49,654
I say Pam.

1796
05:00:49,725 --> 05:00:51,352
No! Look,
this isn't Pam's fault.

1797
05:00:51,426 --> 05:00:53,792
This is all my fault.
She's... She's innocent.

1798
05:00:53,862 --> 05:00:57,628
Oh. Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Time's running out.

1799
05:00:57,699 --> 05:00:59,166
Okay, Kelly, then.
You decide.

1800
05:00:59,234 --> 05:01:00,929
No! Please!

1801
05:01:01,003 --> 05:01:02,664
Come on, Stu!

1802
05:01:02,738 --> 05:01:03,864
Don't you get the game yet?

1803
05:01:03,939 --> 05:01:06,775
You're a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.

1804
05:01:06,775 --> 05:01:07,298
You're a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.

1805
05:01:07,376 --> 05:01:08,343
Blonde or brunette?

1806
05:01:08,410 --> 05:01:10,139
Time's running out.

1807
05:01:10,212 --> 05:01:12,112
You or them?
Kelly or Pam?

1808
05:01:12,180 --> 05:01:14,273
Kelly or Pam?
Kelly or Pam?

1809
05:01:14,349 --> 05:01:16,647
Come on, Stu.

1810
05:01:16,718 --> 05:01:19,278
Stop this.

1811
05:01:19,354 --> 05:01:20,753
I can't take this
anymore.

1812
05:01:20,822 --> 05:01:22,619
What are you doing?
Get up.

1813
05:01:22,691 --> 05:01:24,249
I was looking
for my ring.

1814
05:01:24,326 --> 05:01:25,350
Get up, Stuart!

1815
05:01:25,427 --> 05:01:26,359
L... l...

1816
05:01:26,428 --> 05:01:27,360
Stand up and be a man!

1817
05:01:27,429 --> 05:01:29,920
You're embarrassing
yourself!

1818
05:01:32,768 --> 05:01:34,235
Captain, yeah,
I got it.

1819
05:01:34,302 --> 05:01:35,564
The rifleman on
the east side of the street

1820
05:01:35,637 --> 05:01:38,265
reports the subject pulled
a small, dark object

1821
05:01:38,340 --> 05:01:39,432
out of his pants pocket.

1822
05:01:39,508 --> 05:01:41,032
All right. You're
lookin' at a suicide

1823
05:01:41,109 --> 05:01:42,542
now on national
fuckin' TV.

1824
05:01:42,611 --> 05:01:44,238
You gonna let me take
this over, Captain?

1825
05:01:44,312 --> 05:01:45,802
Tell everybody
to hold on, all right?

1826
05:01:45,881 --> 05:01:47,041
Tell everybody to
hold their fire.

1827
05:01:47,115 --> 05:01:49,015
Everybody hold.
Stay ready, but hold.

1828
05:01:50,285 --> 05:01:52,583
Caller: Stuart, you're
beginning to annoy me.

1829
05:01:52,654 --> 05:01:55,885
Y-Y-You can't do this.

1830
05:01:55,957 --> 05:01:59,825
Caller: Stu, no more spinning,
no more excuses.

1831
05:02:01,763 --> 05:02:03,697
Oh, what are you doing?
Look, listen.

1832
05:02:03,765 --> 05:02:05,096
Listen,
please listen to me.

1833
05:02:05,167 --> 05:02:06,600
Caller: No more delays, Stuart.

1834
05:02:06,668 --> 05:02:09,159
L... l... I'm on my knees
begging you not to kill me.

1835
05:02:09,237 --> 05:02:11,637
Well, I will if you keep up
this pathetic spectacle.

1836
05:02:13,608 --> 05:02:15,405
Hey, look, from up
in your high window,

1837
05:02:15,477 --> 05:02:16,705
you could kill anyone
on the street.

1838
05:02:16,778 --> 05:02:17,710
Caller: Yes, I know that, Stu.

1839
05:02:17,779 --> 05:02:19,713
And, uh...

1840
05:02:19,781 --> 05:02:21,442
y-you can pick off
any of the cops like Ramey

1841
05:02:21,516 --> 05:02:22,448
with your rifle.

1842
05:02:22,517 --> 05:02:24,212
Shut up and stand up!

1843
05:02:24,286 --> 05:02:25,844
Look,
why threaten Kelly?

1844
05:02:25,921 --> 05:02:27,616
You said you liked
how she sounded

1845
05:02:27,689 --> 05:02:28,917
on the phone
at the store.

1846
05:02:28,990 --> 05:02:29,922
Please don't hurt her.

1847
05:02:29,991 --> 05:02:31,720
Please don't fuckin' hurt
my wife.

1848
05:02:31,793 --> 05:02:33,351
This doesn't have to end
with me shooting you,

1849
05:02:33,428 --> 05:02:34,725
but you're leaving me
no choice.

1850
05:02:34,796 --> 05:02:36,229
Now get up!

1851
05:02:38,300 --> 05:02:39,733
Okay, how does this end?

1852
05:02:39,801 --> 05:02:41,860
Tell me how this ends.

1853
05:02:41,937 --> 05:02:43,905
Caller: The stage is almost set.

1854
05:02:43,972 --> 05:02:45,303
People are gonna be
eating dinner

1855
05:02:45,373 --> 05:02:47,204
watching you die.

1856
05:02:47,275 --> 05:02:49,038
We got a sniper
situation here.

1857
05:02:50,545 --> 05:02:52,035
What about that
phone call earlier

1858
05:02:52,114 --> 05:02:53,274
to your store?

1859
05:02:53,348 --> 05:02:55,213
I got a phone call
this afternoon from somebody.

1860
05:02:55,283 --> 05:02:56,511
I think
it was a prank call.

1861
05:02:56,585 --> 05:02:58,951
He told me Stu would be
calling me from a phone booth.

1862
05:02:59,020 --> 05:03:00,078
How long will it take to
bring up a record

1863
05:03:00,155 --> 05:03:01,486
of Mrs. Shepard's
incoming calls?

1864
05:03:01,556 --> 05:03:02,750
If he's using
that secure line,

1865
05:03:02,824 --> 05:03:04,451
we won't know anything
more than we know now.

1866
05:03:04,526 --> 05:03:05,618
Say he didn't.

1867
05:03:05,694 --> 05:03:06,956
Let's just assume
that he's human,

1868
05:03:07,028 --> 05:03:08,188
makes mistakes
just like all of us.

1869
05:03:08,263 --> 05:03:10,026
I need to
get that number.

1870
05:03:10,098 --> 05:03:11,725
I've been waiting
for that number.

1871
05:03:11,800 --> 05:03:13,062
It was a guy.

1872
05:03:13,135 --> 05:03:15,103
He... He sounded like
mid-thirties.

1873
05:03:15,170 --> 05:03:16,330
Mrs. Shepard, you know
it would be safer

1874
05:03:16,404 --> 05:03:18,929
if you got back
in the car, okay?

1875
05:03:19,007 --> 05:03:20,770
Please get back
in the car.

1876
05:03:20,842 --> 05:03:21,900
I want you to divert

1877
05:03:21,977 --> 05:03:23,444
the incoming
E.S.U. Units

1878
05:03:23,512 --> 05:03:24,809
to Broadway and just
hold them there.

1879
05:03:24,880 --> 05:03:26,142
You want me to start
clearing the streets?

1880
05:03:26,214 --> 05:03:27,272
Yeah, that sounds like
a good idea.

1881
05:03:27,349 --> 05:03:28,338
No, no, no.

1882
05:03:28,416 --> 05:03:29,678
I don't want the sniper
to be aware

1883
05:03:29,751 --> 05:03:30,911
of any of our movements.

1884
05:03:30,986 --> 05:03:32,419
He's already
got position on us.

1885
05:03:32,487 --> 05:03:35,217
Let's not let him know
we know too much, okay?

1886
05:03:35,290 --> 05:03:36,222
I got you.

1887
05:03:36,291 --> 05:03:38,020
- Jonah!
- Yeah?

1888
05:03:38,093 --> 05:03:39,651
Don't look up.

1889
05:03:42,531 --> 05:03:44,863
Give me sharpshooters
looking at those windows.

1890
05:03:44,933 --> 05:03:45,900
You got it, Captain.

1891
05:03:45,967 --> 05:03:47,628
I'm gonna buy us
some time here.

1892
05:03:47,702 --> 05:03:49,329
All right.

1893
05:03:55,610 --> 05:03:57,305
Stu, is it okay
if I come out

1894
05:03:57,379 --> 05:03:58,971
and talk to you
for a second?

1895
05:03:59,047 --> 05:04:00,014
I don't know.

1896
05:04:00,081 --> 05:04:01,013
Caller: This guy
is so lonely.

1897
05:04:01,082 --> 05:04:03,209
All he wants to do
is talk.

1898
05:04:03,285 --> 05:04:05,515
You're walking through
a bad dream,

1899
05:04:05,587 --> 05:04:06,849
and you can't wake up.

1900
05:04:06,922 --> 05:04:08,446
Caller: Okay, now he's really
testing my patience.

1901
05:04:08,523 --> 05:04:10,957
You want to wake up,
Stu?

1902
05:04:11,026 --> 05:04:12,823
I want to,
but...

1903
05:04:12,894 --> 05:04:14,452
l... l...
I got issues

1904
05:04:14,529 --> 05:04:16,121
I can't
talk about.

1905
05:04:16,198 --> 05:04:18,189
That your psychiatrist
on the phone, Stu?

1906
05:04:18,266 --> 05:04:21,360
Yeah. I, uh, I'm
paying him overtime.

1907
05:04:21,436 --> 05:04:24,530
That was pretty brave,
what you did.

1908
05:04:25,607 --> 05:04:28,098
Admitting all that stuff
to your wife.

1909
05:04:28,176 --> 05:04:29,404
It was liberating, right?

1910
05:04:29,477 --> 05:04:31,672
Should've been.

1911
05:04:31,746 --> 05:04:33,839
Maybe if I could be
more honest with my wife,

1912
05:04:33,915 --> 05:04:35,849
you know, then...
then I don't know,

1913
05:04:35,917 --> 05:04:37,782
maybe something would've
turned out different.

1914
05:04:37,853 --> 05:04:39,753
Caller: Oh, please.

1915
05:04:39,821 --> 05:04:40,981
Trust is the key.

1916
05:04:41,056 --> 05:04:42,284
You trust me, Stu?

1917
05:04:42,357 --> 05:04:43,881
Caller: Get this man
a seat on <i>Oprah.</i>

1918
05:04:43,959 --> 05:04:46,154
I want to, but
I got, I got...

1919
05:04:46,228 --> 05:04:47,718
issues I can't
talk about.

1920
05:04:47,796 --> 05:04:50,526
Caller: Yes. Lethal issues.
Tell him to stay back.

1921
05:04:50,599 --> 05:04:52,590
Look, don't come
any closer.

1922
05:04:52,667 --> 05:04:53,964
Hey, I don't
want to cause

1923
05:04:54,035 --> 05:04:55,366
or make anything
harder for you.

1924
05:04:55,437 --> 05:04:57,667
Caller: Pam, Ramey, Kelly,
people on the street.

1925
05:04:57,739 --> 05:04:59,263
You've got a lot of lives
in your hands, Stu.

1926
05:04:59,341 --> 05:05:00,467
Look, I already
told you

1927
05:05:00,542 --> 05:05:01,600
this is a private
conversation.

1928
05:05:01,676 --> 05:05:02,700
Now, what the fuck
do you want?

1929
05:05:02,777 --> 05:05:05,268
I want to let you know
that it's safe

1930
05:05:05,347 --> 05:05:06,371
outside the booth.

1931
05:05:06,448 --> 05:05:07,506
Caller: No, it's not.

1932
05:05:07,582 --> 05:05:08,810
Always get out of the
booth. You can't stay...

1933
05:05:08,884 --> 05:05:10,818
I like it
in the fuckin' booth!

1934
05:05:10,886 --> 05:05:12,148
All right?
It's my whole world.

1935
05:05:12,220 --> 05:05:13,312
Now, this is my booth,
and I'm not coming out

1936
05:05:13,388 --> 05:05:14,514
ever, all right? Never!

1937
05:05:14,589 --> 05:05:16,284
We're not gonna try
to force you to come out

1938
05:05:16,358 --> 05:05:19,327
because then there could be
some kind of miscalculation,

1939
05:05:19,394 --> 05:05:22,727
and then I would never
find out why this happened.

1940
05:05:22,797 --> 05:05:24,958
Stu...

1941
05:05:25,033 --> 05:05:26,523
I'm afraid.

1942
05:05:26,601 --> 05:05:29,126
I'm afraid that I'm
gonna be standing by

1943
05:05:29,204 --> 05:05:33,140
and my men are gonna
shoot some guy,

1944
05:05:33,208 --> 05:05:37,042
and when we find out
what he has in his hand

1945
05:05:37,112 --> 05:05:39,512
once we turn over
his dead body

1946
05:05:39,581 --> 05:05:40,707
and we see the thing

1947
05:05:40,782 --> 05:05:42,647
that he was
threatening people with,

1948
05:05:42,717 --> 05:05:46,153
we realize that it was just
a little black bible.

1949
05:05:46,221 --> 05:05:48,416
Or a cell phone.

1950
05:05:48,490 --> 05:05:50,458
Caller: Don't push me, Stu.

1951
05:05:53,528 --> 05:05:55,587
I'm not gonna
let that happen here.

1952
05:05:55,664 --> 05:05:57,564
All I wanted to make
was a phone call.

1953
05:05:57,632 --> 05:05:58,724
One lousy
phone call.

1954
05:05:58,800 --> 05:06:00,631
Caller: That's enough, Stu.

1955
05:06:00,702 --> 05:06:03,569
Ramey: You got some bad news
on that call, right?

1956
05:06:03,638 --> 05:06:05,003
The worst.

1957
05:06:05,073 --> 05:06:07,200
It made you want to
jump off the edge.

1958
05:06:08,510 --> 05:06:09,704
I've been falling
ever since.

1959
05:06:09,778 --> 05:06:11,370
Caller: I'm gonna
push <i>him</i> over the edge.

1960
05:06:11,446 --> 05:06:12,378
Just say the word.

1961
05:06:12,447 --> 05:06:13,379
[Cocks Rifle]

1962
05:06:13,448 --> 05:06:14,472
It's time to land, man.

1963
05:06:14,549 --> 05:06:17,017
When you hit bottom,
you die.

1964
05:06:17,085 --> 05:06:18,518
I'm your safety net.

1965
05:06:18,586 --> 05:06:21,749
Caller: Oh,
please say the word.

1966
05:06:21,823 --> 05:06:24,053
If I tell you what
you want to know,

1967
05:06:24,125 --> 05:06:25,251
you'll die, too.

1968
05:06:25,327 --> 05:06:26,658
Caller: Exactly.

1969
05:06:29,898 --> 05:06:30,990
I'm going.

1970
05:06:31,066 --> 05:06:31,998
Stu: Good.

1971
05:06:33,868 --> 05:06:34,800
Look, Stu.

1972
05:06:34,869 --> 05:06:37,269
Um, we put a call out
to your lawyer.

1973
05:06:37,339 --> 05:06:39,603
Your wife,
she gave us the number.

1974
05:06:39,674 --> 05:06:45,010
And I got my best men
working on

1975
05:06:45,080 --> 05:06:47,844
bringing him down.
Okay?

1976
05:06:47,916 --> 05:06:50,407
Caller: That's it.
The captain gets a bullet.

1977
05:06:50,485 --> 05:06:51,509
Go on, get out of here!

1978
05:06:51,586 --> 05:06:52,848
D-D-Did you hear
what I said, asshole?

1979
05:06:52,921 --> 05:06:54,354
Get out of here!
Go on, now! Go!

1980
05:06:54,422 --> 05:06:55,855
Enough of this sideshow,
Stu.

1981
05:06:55,924 --> 05:06:56,891
No problem.

1982
05:06:56,958 --> 05:06:58,391
Your sins have
finally caught up to you.

1983
05:06:58,460 --> 05:07:00,360
Oh, so this is all some
religious thing, huh?

1984
05:07:00,428 --> 05:07:02,726
Ah, that would explain it.
Bible-crazed killer picks on

1985
05:07:02,797 --> 05:07:04,389
fashion-obsessed P.R. Guy.

1986
05:07:04,466 --> 05:07:05,933
Tell me
what you want, then.

1987
05:07:06,001 --> 05:07:07,366
What everyone wants...

1988
05:07:07,435 --> 05:07:09,699
For the bad guy
to get what he deserves.

1989
05:07:09,771 --> 05:07:11,204
Go for the gun.

1990
05:07:11,272 --> 05:07:13,001
Kill myself?

1991
05:07:13,074 --> 05:07:16,566
Caller: Yes. It would be a rare,
unselfish act.

1992
05:07:16,644 --> 05:07:17,702
Uhh.

1993
05:07:21,082 --> 05:07:22,208
We got hostile action.

1994
05:07:22,283 --> 05:07:23,910
Hey, hey. Nothing is hostile
until I say it is.

1995
05:07:23,985 --> 05:07:25,543
L... I can't find it.

1996
05:07:25,620 --> 05:07:27,212
Caller: Kelly, Pam...
Bam, bam!

1997
05:07:27,288 --> 05:07:29,552
All right, all right. Look.
I found it. I got it.

1998
05:07:29,624 --> 05:07:30,750
Then let's see it.

1999
05:07:30,825 --> 05:07:31,814
Let everyone see it.

2000
05:07:31,893 --> 05:07:32,985
The cops will kill me.

2001
05:07:33,061 --> 05:07:36,258
Yes. You're talking
prime-time material now.

2002
05:07:36,331 --> 05:07:38,322
All this shit just
to watch me die, huh?

2003
05:07:38,400 --> 05:07:40,334
No. To get you to do
what's right.

2004
05:07:40,402 --> 05:07:43,599
If you want
to save yourself, confess.

2005
05:07:43,671 --> 05:07:45,571
I already told Kelly
everything.

2006
05:07:45,640 --> 05:07:46,664
Everything?

2007
05:07:46,741 --> 05:07:49,835
No. No more excuses
and half-truths, Stuart.

2008
05:07:49,911 --> 05:07:53,711
You look out into those cameras
and you bare your soul.

2009
05:07:53,782 --> 05:07:56,580
TV seems to help bring out
the worst in people.

2010
05:07:56,651 --> 05:07:58,516
You should be fine.

2011
05:07:58,586 --> 05:08:00,019
How those techs doing?
We got anything?

2012
05:08:00,088 --> 05:08:02,181
No, not yet.
Not yet.

2013
05:08:02,257 --> 05:08:04,316
We haven't found
your lawyer yet, Stu,

2014
05:08:04,392 --> 05:08:06,053
but we're
getting close. Okay?

2015
05:08:06,127 --> 05:08:07,355
Caller: Stuart,

2016
05:08:07,429 --> 05:08:11,365
I'm offering you a chance
to redeem yourself.

2017
05:08:11,433 --> 05:08:12,457
Come on, Stu.

2018
05:08:12,534 --> 05:08:14,092
Humble yourself
in front of your loved ones

2019
05:08:14,169 --> 05:08:15,761
and millions of strangers

2020
05:08:15,837 --> 05:08:17,065
and me.

2021
05:08:17,138 --> 05:08:18,867
It's do-or-die time.

2022
05:08:18,940 --> 05:08:21,101
What, you couldn't find
anyone worse than me?

2023
05:08:21,176 --> 05:08:22,905
I'm not, not a murderer
or a child molester

2024
05:08:22,977 --> 05:08:25,207
but a publicist
who has fantasies

2025
05:08:25,280 --> 05:08:26,907
about pretty
little actresses,

2026
05:08:26,981 --> 05:08:29,279
who spends all his money
on Italian suits

2027
05:08:29,350 --> 05:08:31,784
and dry-cleaning so people
will think he's important,

2028
05:08:31,853 --> 05:08:33,946
who doesn't waste his time
being nice to people

2029
05:08:34,022 --> 05:08:35,887
who aren't any use to him.
These are my crimes?

2030
05:08:35,957 --> 05:08:39,154
Stuart,
I know your crimes.

2031
05:08:39,227 --> 05:08:40,489
Tell them.

2032
05:09:04,531 --> 05:09:06,795
I've never done
anything for anybody

2033
05:09:06,867 --> 05:09:08,926
who... who couldn't do
something for me!

2034
05:09:09,002 --> 05:09:10,401
I string along an eager kid

2035
05:09:10,470 --> 05:09:12,904
with promises
that I'll pay him money.

2036
05:09:12,973 --> 05:09:16,136
I only keep him around
because he looks up to me.

2037
05:09:16,209 --> 05:09:19,406
Adam, if you're watching,
don't be a publicist.

2038
05:09:19,479 --> 05:09:20,639
You're too good for it.

2039
05:09:20,714 --> 05:09:24,150
I, uh, I lie in person
and on the phone.

2040
05:09:24,217 --> 05:09:25,809
I lie to my friends.

2041
05:09:25,886 --> 05:09:28,650
I lie to newspapers
and magazines

2042
05:09:28,722 --> 05:09:31,418
who, who sell my lies
to more and more people.

2043
05:09:31,491 --> 05:09:34,756
L-l-I'm just a part
of a big cycle of lies.

2044
05:09:34,828 --> 05:09:36,557
I should be
fuckin' president.

2045
05:09:36,630 --> 05:09:38,962
I wear all this Italian shit
because underneath,

2046
05:09:39,032 --> 05:09:41,330
I still feel
like the Bronx.

2047
05:09:41,401 --> 05:09:44,165
I think I need these clothes
and this watch.

2048
05:09:44,237 --> 05:09:48,264
My $2,000 watch is a fake,
and so am I.

2049
05:09:48,341 --> 05:09:52,402
I neglected the things
I should've valued most.

2050
05:09:52,479 --> 05:09:54,447
I valued this shit.

2051
05:09:54,514 --> 05:09:57,847
I take off my wedding ring
to call Pam.

2052
05:09:57,918 --> 05:09:59,977
Kelly, that's Pam.

2053
05:10:03,590 --> 05:10:04,784
Somebody got a 20
on this Pam?

2054
05:10:04,858 --> 05:10:07,122
Don't blame her.
I never told her I was married.

2055
05:10:07,194 --> 05:10:10,163
And if I did, she,
she would've told me to go home.

2056
05:10:11,865 --> 05:10:13,799
Kelly,
looking at you now,

2057
05:10:13,867 --> 05:10:16,267
I'm ashamed of myself.

2058
05:10:16,336 --> 05:10:17,826
All right?

2059
05:10:17,904 --> 05:10:22,136
I mean, l... I work so hard
on this image,

2060
05:10:22,209 --> 05:10:23,642
on Stu Shepard,

2061
05:10:23,710 --> 05:10:26,144
the asshole who refers
to himself in the third person,

2062
05:10:26,213 --> 05:10:29,341
that I only proved
I should be alone.

2063
05:10:29,416 --> 05:10:32,749
I've been dressing up
as something I'm not

2064
05:10:32,819 --> 05:10:34,081
for so long...

2065
05:10:34,154 --> 05:10:37,351
I'm so afraid you won't like
what's underneath.

2066
05:10:37,424 --> 05:10:39,449
But here I am.

2067
05:10:39,526 --> 05:10:41,084
I'm just flesh and blood

2068
05:10:41,161 --> 05:10:42,992
and weakness.

2069
05:10:43,063 --> 05:10:45,122
I, uh...

2070
05:10:45,198 --> 05:10:47,723
I love you
so fucking much.

2071
05:10:47,801 --> 05:10:49,701
[Sobbing]

2072
05:10:49,769 --> 05:10:55,366
I, um,
I take off this ring

2073
05:10:55,442 --> 05:10:58,934
because it only reminds me
of how I failed you.

2074
05:10:59,012 --> 05:11:00,775
And, uh...

2075
05:11:00,847 --> 05:11:02,678
and l... I don't want
to give you up.

2076
05:11:02,749 --> 05:11:04,444
I want to make
things better,

2077
05:11:04,517 --> 05:11:06,610
but it may not be
my choice anymore.

2078
05:11:06,686 --> 05:11:08,779
You... You deserve better.

2079
05:11:24,304 --> 05:11:27,637
You're not gonna
let me go.

2080
05:11:27,707 --> 05:11:28,639
Caller: No.

2081
05:11:28,708 --> 05:11:31,074
You never were.

2082
05:11:31,144 --> 05:11:32,702
I know a thing about lies,

2083
05:11:32,779 --> 05:11:35,577
and I know a thing or two
about liars as well.

2084
05:11:35,649 --> 05:11:37,139
Then why the confession?

2085
05:11:43,623 --> 05:11:45,921
I didn't do it for you.

2086
05:11:50,530 --> 05:11:51,724
Captain, Captain.

2087
05:11:51,798 --> 05:11:54,733
The call to his wife
originated 2:17

2088
05:11:54,801 --> 05:11:57,099
at a hard line from
the old Barkley Hotel.

2089
05:11:57,170 --> 05:11:58,228
You got a room?

2090
05:11:58,305 --> 05:11:59,795
604.

2091
05:11:59,873 --> 05:12:01,101
Second window
from the corner.

2092
05:12:01,174 --> 05:12:02,641
All E.S.U. Units
still holding.

2093
05:12:02,709 --> 05:12:04,939
Bring 'em in from
the 52nd Street side.

2094
05:12:05,011 --> 05:12:06,273
Cover the windows,
the doors,

2095
05:12:06,346 --> 05:12:08,109
the fire escape,
every goddamn point of exit.

2096
05:12:08,181 --> 05:12:09,113
Right.

2097
05:12:09,182 --> 05:12:10,376
Stu!

2098
05:12:10,450 --> 05:12:11,439
Sgt. Cole: 52nd Street side.

2099
05:12:11,518 --> 05:12:14,316
...your lawyer's
coming down now!

2100
05:12:14,387 --> 05:12:15,877
Now.

2101
05:12:15,956 --> 05:12:18,789
Caller: At least you'll die
with a clean conscience.

2102
05:12:18,858 --> 05:12:20,758
No. You're the one
that's gonna fuckin' die.

2103
05:12:20,827 --> 05:12:22,454
Listen. Listen.
You can hear them right now.

2104
05:12:22,529 --> 05:12:24,121
They're coming up the stairs.
They're coming to get you.

2105
05:12:24,197 --> 05:12:25,630
And you know why?
Because I sent them.

2106
05:12:25,699 --> 05:12:26,893
Stuart, you can't
stop lying, can you?

2107
05:12:26,967 --> 05:12:28,127
What, I can't stop lying?

2108
05:12:28,201 --> 05:12:29,463
They're coming up
the fucking stairs.

2109
05:12:29,536 --> 05:12:30,628
They're coming to get you.
Look around you.

2110
05:12:30,704 --> 05:12:31,830
Look around you.

2111
05:12:31,905 --> 05:12:33,236
That room's getting fuckin'
smaller every second,

2112
05:12:33,306 --> 05:12:34,898
isn't it? Inch by inch.
You know what?

2113
05:12:34,975 --> 05:12:36,408
Until it's not gonna be
any bigger

2114
05:12:36,476 --> 05:12:37,738
than this fuckin'
goddamn booth.

2115
05:12:37,811 --> 05:12:39,403
They're in position.
They're in position.

2116
05:12:39,479 --> 05:12:40,468
- Move!
- Move! Move!

2117
05:12:46,987 --> 05:12:48,318
Caller: No, Stuart.
There's nobody out there.

2118
05:12:48,388 --> 05:12:49,582
There's nobody there?
Listen,

2119
05:12:49,656 --> 05:12:50,918
they're coming through
that fuckin' door

2120
05:12:50,991 --> 05:12:52,253
to put you
out of your misery.

2121
05:12:52,325 --> 05:12:53,587
You only got
a couple of seconds left.

2122
05:12:53,660 --> 05:12:54,922
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna run?

2123
05:12:54,995 --> 05:12:56,758
If this is true, Stuart,
then I have to take

2124
05:12:56,830 --> 05:12:58,092
someone with me,
don't I?

2125
05:12:58,164 --> 05:12:59,256
And since Kelly is
the most important thing

2126
05:12:59,332 --> 05:13:01,596
to you in your life,
I'll take her.

2127
05:13:01,668 --> 05:13:03,966
Take me! Take me!
This is about me!

2128
05:13:04,037 --> 05:13:07,768
I'm the fuckin' one
you want. Take me!

2129
05:13:07,841 --> 05:13:10,105
This is about me!
Come on!

2130
05:13:10,176 --> 05:13:12,303
Take me!
It's me you want!

2131
05:13:12,379 --> 05:13:14,677
[Echoing] Me you want!
This is about me!

2132
05:13:14,748 --> 05:13:15,680
I'm the fuckin' one
you want!

2133
05:13:15,749 --> 05:13:18,980
Come on! Take me!

2134
05:13:19,052 --> 05:13:21,577
[Gunshot]

2135
05:13:26,026 --> 05:13:28,688
[Kelly Screaming]

2136
05:13:48,148 --> 05:13:51,049
This is Captain Ramey.
Somebody talk to me.

2137
05:13:51,117 --> 05:13:53,085
We're too late, Captain.
Son of a bitch psycho

2138
05:13:53,153 --> 05:13:54,586
heard us coming
and slashed his throat

2139
05:13:54,654 --> 05:13:55,586
with
a carpenter's knife.

2140
05:13:55,655 --> 05:13:56,587
What's his condition?

2141
05:13:56,656 --> 05:13:58,590
Critical. He's lost
a lot of blood.

2142
05:13:58,658 --> 05:14:00,148
Get him down here now.

2143
05:14:00,226 --> 05:14:02,091
I don't want nobody
dying on me.

2144
05:14:02,162 --> 05:14:03,288
All right.

2145
05:14:03,396 --> 05:14:05,557
Kelly, where's Kelly?

2146
05:14:05,632 --> 05:14:07,429
Sgt. Cole: Your wife's fine,
all right?

2147
05:14:07,500 --> 05:14:08,990
Now try not to sit up.

2148
05:14:10,804 --> 05:14:11,998
What hit me?

2149
05:14:12,072 --> 05:14:13,767
Rubber bullet.
Figured if someone

2150
05:14:13,840 --> 05:14:15,501
was gonna shoot you,
might as well be us.

2151
05:14:15,575 --> 05:14:17,440
Heh heh. Thanks.

2152
05:14:17,510 --> 05:14:19,910
Uhh, did you get him?

2153
05:14:19,979 --> 05:14:21,173
You did.

2154
05:14:21,247 --> 05:14:22,612
I didn't do anything.

2155
05:14:22,682 --> 05:14:24,115
Gotta give yourself
some credit.

2156
05:14:24,184 --> 05:14:26,049
You got yourself
out alive.

2157
05:14:26,119 --> 05:14:27,780
Doesn't always
happen that way.

2158
05:14:27,854 --> 05:14:29,219
- Kelly: Stu!
- Stu: Kelly!

2159
05:14:29,289 --> 05:14:30,586
Stu!

2160
05:14:30,657 --> 05:14:31,555
- Are you okay?
- It's okay.

2161
05:14:31,624 --> 05:14:32,716
I'm okay.

2162
05:14:32,792 --> 05:14:34,020
Oh, God.

2163
05:14:34,094 --> 05:14:35,220
I was so afraid.

2164
05:14:35,295 --> 05:14:37,729
I thought I wasn't ever
gonna see you again.

2165
05:14:37,797 --> 05:14:38,786
Me, too.

2166
05:14:38,865 --> 05:14:41,425
A lot of things
we got to talk about.

2167
05:14:41,501 --> 05:14:44,095
I only want to talk about
what you want to tell me.

2168
05:14:44,170 --> 05:14:45,899
I want to tell you
everything.

2169
05:14:45,972 --> 05:14:46,904
Everything.

2170
05:14:49,442 --> 05:14:50,739
Get that gurney
over here, please.

2171
05:14:50,810 --> 05:14:51,799
Get over here.

2172
05:14:51,878 --> 05:14:53,038
We lost him.

2173
05:14:53,113 --> 05:14:55,741
Hey.

2174
05:14:55,815 --> 05:14:57,305
Stu: I want
to stand up.

2175
05:14:57,383 --> 05:14:58,372
I got him.

2176
05:14:58,451 --> 05:15:00,248
Yeah, I got
to see him.

2177
05:15:00,320 --> 05:15:01,912
You don't wanna see
this, Mrs. Shepard.

2178
05:15:01,988 --> 05:15:02,920
Yes, I do.

2179
05:15:02,989 --> 05:15:03,921
Okay, take it easy.

2180
05:15:03,990 --> 05:15:04,922
Yes, I do.

2181
05:15:04,991 --> 05:15:05,923
Allow me.
Allow me.

2182
05:15:05,992 --> 05:15:06,924
Go ahead.

2183
05:15:12,832 --> 05:15:14,800
Ramey: You
recognize him?

2184
05:15:14,868 --> 05:15:16,768
Yeah. He... He
was down there

2185
05:15:16,836 --> 05:15:18,497
trying to deliver me
a pizza

2186
05:15:18,571 --> 05:15:21,597
10 minutes before
I got the call.

2187
05:15:21,674 --> 05:15:23,608
I, uh, told him
to fuck off.

2188
05:15:23,676 --> 05:15:25,701
That's enough
these days.

2189
05:15:30,683 --> 05:15:32,878
Just give it
a minute.

2190
05:15:32,952 --> 05:15:34,886
We'll be driving,
and you'll be flyin',

2191
05:15:34,954 --> 05:15:35,886
my friend.

2192
05:15:35,955 --> 05:15:37,217
Whatever you say.

2193
05:16:12,492 --> 05:16:14,756
[Echoing] Nice shoes.

2194
05:16:18,565 --> 05:16:20,760
Italian.

2195
05:16:23,503 --> 05:16:26,438
You hung up, Stu.

2196
05:16:26,506 --> 05:16:29,407
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

2197
05:16:29,475 --> 05:16:34,003
I feel bad
about the pizza guy.

2198
05:16:34,080 --> 05:16:37,277
But I couldn't miss seeing
you and Kelly reunited.

2199
05:16:37,350 --> 05:16:40,786
You don't have to thank me.
Nobody ever does.

2200
05:16:40,853 --> 05:16:43,219
I just hope your
newfound honesty lasts.

2201
05:16:44,524 --> 05:16:46,116
Because if it doesn't...

2202
05:16:46,192 --> 05:16:48,456
you'll be
hearing from me.

2203
05:16:49,729 --> 05:16:50,821
Stu, Echoing: Help.

2204
05:16:52,532 --> 05:16:53,794
[Softly] Help.

2205
05:17:00,873 --> 05:17:03,343
[Gasps] Help.

2206
05:17:03,343 --> 05:17:04,469
[Gasps] Help.

2207
05:17:17,724 --> 05:17:20,158
Caller, Voice-over:
Isn't it funny?

2208
05:17:20,226 --> 05:17:21,989
You hear a phone ring,

2209
05:17:22,061 --> 05:17:24,655
and it could be anybody.

2210
05:17:24,731 --> 05:17:28,497
But a ringing phone
has to be answered, doesn't it?

2211
05:17:31,838 --> 05:17:33,430
[Whispering] Doesn't it?

2212
05:17:37,343 --> 05:17:38,640
