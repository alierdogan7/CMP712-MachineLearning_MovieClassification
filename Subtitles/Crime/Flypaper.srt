(CHATTING INDISTINCTLY)

2
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,587
Make it quick, honey. We're closing.

3
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,760
Well, this is unacceptable.

4
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,963
Because I booked it yesterday.

5
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,925
Yes, a one-hour sunset bliss massage
with Tanya.

6
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,767
No, it has to be Tanya.

7
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,224
I need to know that this bank is secure.

8
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,981
Just trust me. I've upgraded dozens of banks.

9
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,600
- it'll be fine.
- I don't need fine. I need guarantees.

10
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,482
Gordon, you've got them.

11
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,696
It's a security upgrade,
not the end of the world.

12
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,984
I swear, Kaitlin, if he keeps me late again
and I miss Cougar Town,

13
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,610
I am gonna burn this place to the ground.

14
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,863
Oh, I hear you, hon. We've all got plans.

15
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,415
Mr. Sullivan, it's always a pleasure to see you.

16
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,376
REX: Look, I scheduled
this massage a month ago.

17
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,671
No, I need Tanya.
Her hands are like little jackhammers

18
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,502
Well, who can I get?

19
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,086
Jonathan? Well, does he have strong hands?

20
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,340
Hello!

21
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,265
Ooh! Come to mama.

22

Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, oh, oh.

23
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,435
Son of a bitch.

24
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,240
- How may I help you today, sir?
- Change for a hundred.

25
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,653
Absolutely. How would you like it broken?

26
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,746
Seven nickels, 31 quarters and 919 dimes.

27
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,912
What?

28
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,373
Oh, you're right, that's too many dimes.

29
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,617
I'm gonna do 107 nickels,

30
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,830
839 dimes, 29 quarters

31
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,382

Is that Chile?

33
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,261
Brazil.

34
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,099
You know what? I'm never gonna use
the half-dollar pieces.

35
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:05,557
Can I get 101 nickels,
157 quarters and 557 dimes, please?

36
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,351
- Is this a joke?
- No. I just have this thing for coins.

37
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,405
I like their weight, I like their size,
I like the way they jingle in my pocket.

38
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,238
- That's kind of weird.
- What is?

39
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,205
The numbers you mentioned, 101, 157, 557.
They're all prime numbers.

40
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,290
No one's ever noticed that before.

41
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,410
I work with numbers all day.

42
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,329
You do that in your head?

43
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,209
Yes. Good trick at math parties.

44
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,048
- I bet.
- What's your name?

45
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,172
- Kaitlin.
- Kaitlin. I am Tripp.

46
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,345
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi, we don't actually, um,

(LAUGHING)

48
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,306

50
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,736
When are you getting married?

51
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,787
How do you know I'm getting married?

52
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,033
Oh, my wedding gifts.

53
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,461
That's also quite a rock.
Are you marrying Jay-Z or somebody?

54
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,004
My fiancé's well off, yes.

55
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,334
Well off? They're getting married
in Brunei in two days.

56
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,549
My husband won't even take me to the Sizzler.

57
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,966
Oh, he's rich. But is he happy?

58
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,471
We're extremely happy.
How kind of you to ask.

59
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,020
Check Darrien.

60
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,139

Yeah.

Go, go, go!

66
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:59,421
And one, two, three, four, five, six

67
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,630
and one makes seven.

68
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,307
Is there anything else I can do
for you today, sir?

69
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,723
No, I'm good. Thank you.

70
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,971

- You're beeping.
- What? Oh.

73
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,356
Yes, it reminds me to take my meds.

Very nice meeting you, Kaitlin.

Nice to meet you, too, Tripp.
Good luck with your whole thing.

What's it look like, man?
We robbing the bank.

84

Yeah, ain't it sort of obvious
with the guns and everything?

85
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,650
No. This is our job. Stand down.

86
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,816
I ain't see your name on the sign out there.

87

- Proceed as planned.

Stop the security update.

94
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,010
If I don't let the system reboot,
the whole bank will lock down.

We know that. Just do it
or I'll shoot you in the fucking face.

- Do it!
- Okay.

to stand down or you will be fired upon!

Come on, dude, let's get out of here.
There's lots of other ATMs.

but a bystander's been hit.

111

I just wanna check to make sure he's okay.
Okay, I'm coming out.

112
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,702
Don't shoot!

113
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,455
Coming out! Don't shoot.

- I've got a clean shot.
- So does everyone. Just stand down.

115

Just wait. Okay?

- This ever happen to you before?
- Hell no.

117

He's dead.

118
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,930
Look, sometimes that happens
in these crossfire situations.

119
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,056
Don't make a big production out of it, okay?

120
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,517
You're here for the vault, right?

121
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,310
Who the fuck is this guy?

122
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,563
And you guys said something
about going after the ATMs?

123
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,726
Maybe.

124
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,484
So, then what's the problem?

125
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,571
Are you seriously suggesting
that we rob the same bank?

126
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,618
Yeah. Why not?

127
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,492
Just pretend it's two different banks.

128
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,829
This guy's nuts.

GATES: Don't even tell me
you're considering it.

130
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,287
Look, I rather not add any more murders
to my rap sheet.

131
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,582
For fuck's sake, one of them wore shorts
to a bank robbery. We gotta kill them.

DARRIEN: I don't know.
What do you think, old man?

133
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,293
I'm with you, D. I've had my fill of killing.

134
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,467
Why the fuck are we even carrying guns?
Come on, I wanna shoot the motherfuckers!

135
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,306
WEINSTEIN: The guns are for taking
hostages. That was always part of the plan.

136
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,347
Now we just have two more hostages.
Am I right, D?

137
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,768
So what's our plan?

138
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,980
If they wanna rob the bank together,
we rob the bank together.

139
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,475
If they wanna kill us, we kill them first.

140
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,817
Cool plan.

141
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,106
DARRIEN: All right, listen up.

142
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,774
We're gonna take the vault.

143
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,440
You two idiots want the ATMs, that's fine.

144
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,113
Just stay the fuck out of our way.

145
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,653
You got it, big city. Rooty-tooty.

146
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,450
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

147
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,450
What now? What are we supposed to do?
What does he want?

148
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,000
You two, could you...

149
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,954
Does he want us to come over?

150
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,622
It's okay.

151
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,706
You, come here.

152
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,550
Watch him.

153
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,753
Give us a sec.

154
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,973
- You want to come?
- Fuck off.

155
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,218
Put the guns down. Put the guns down.

156
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,178
All right, come here.

157
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,936
Let's introduce ourselves.
There's no reason why we can't be friends.

161
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,317
We wanted something
that goes good together,

162
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,410
and Milk 'N Cookies was already taken.

163
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,820
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

164
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,166
I want all the hostages out here now!

165
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:38,721
All right, everybody.
Cell phones, pagers, fucking Twitter things.

166
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,218
Anything with an on/off switch.

167
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,053
Yeah. And guns, obviously.

168
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,351
Thank you for being a terrible bank guard.

169
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,063
Hey, guys, I gotta get out of here.

170
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,690
Of course you gotta get out of here.
You're a fucking hostage.

171
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,316
Get in there!

172
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,945
Hey. Shut up and don't touch anything.

173
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,704
- Get away from the fucking door.
- Can I...

174
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,706
- Stay away from the door.
- All right!

175
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,050
Please don't kill me on the toilet.

176
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,974
Jesus Christ. It smells like
an arsehole factory in here.

177
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,770
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, mate.

178
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,691
These guys are awesome.

179
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,068
Major league, baby.

180
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:52,708
Obviously on behalf of the bank,
I'm just terribly sorry.

181
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,587
Okay, let me just amend that.
We're terribly sorry.

182
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,098
- Rex, please.
- Hey, everybody, I'm Rex Newbauer.

183
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,433
I'm a loan officer. And we're in luck.

184
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,974
Certified post-robbery counselor.

185
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,939
I've counseled
over 75 bank-robbery survivors.

186
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,479
We're gonna make it here, gang.

187
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:14,946
Now, our primary objective
is to become a cohesive unit.

188
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,776
Sir, may I help you, please?

189
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,608
Our primary goal is to get out of here alive.

190
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,991
Okay, well as an expert
in standard bank robbery procedure...

191
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,988
There's nothing standard
about this bank robbery.

192
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,457
We have two heists going on
at the same time with a dead body,

193
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,167
which basically guarantees
that the bank robbers

194
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,494
are gonna come in here and kill us all.

195
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,920
- What?
- Don't tell me that, man.

196
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,539
That's some bullshit. I don't wanna die.

197
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,295
People, let's stay calm!

198
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,630
(SCREAMS)

199
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,222
Okay. Now, this bank opens at 5:00 a.m.

200
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,524
By that time
my colleagues and I will be long gone.

201
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,314
You're all locked in here, okay?

202
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,194
So, even if you were to get out of this kitchen,

203
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,192
you can't get out of the bank.

204
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,190
So sit down and shut up.

205
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,913
What if one of us has a condition
that requires us to use the bathroom a lot?

206
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,162
Yes, there will be bathroom breaks.
You will not try to escape.

207
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,036
You will not try to contact
anyone outside of the bank.

208
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,586
You will not make noise.

209
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,130
(BEEPING)

210
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,341
Really, a watch alarm?
What are you, like, in the sixth grade?

211
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,045
It just goes off every hour.
It reminds me to take my meds,

212
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,347
which unfortunately I'm out of,

213
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,306
- unless anybody has any Depakene.
- I have Xanax.

214
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,009
I got Ativan and Prilosec.

215
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,598
- I've got a couple of Ritalin.
- I might have a few Prozac.

216
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,806
- I take Adderall and Nasonex.
- Are you kidding me?

217
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:35,064
Shut the fuck up! I just said no talking!

218
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,396
- What's going on?
- We got Oprah's Book Club in here.

219
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,738
Hey, you want me to fuck someone up?

220
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,027
No, we're good. Did you hit
the cameras, phones and computers?

221
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,696
Yeah. You sure you don't want me
to fuck someone up?

222
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,494
Yeah, I just said I didn't.
Go get the Scrambler.

223
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,742
All right.

224
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,541
Jesus Christ, that accent is ridiculous.

225
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,706
JELLY: Before we get started,

226
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,004
let's check on the other guys.

227
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,881
I'm about to start on the torch
in a few minutes.

228
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,762
Make sure the time-lock rig is ready.

229
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,635
PEANUT BUTTER: This Shit is SO dope.

230
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,895
What the fuck?

231
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,390
Hey, no problem, man.

232
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,314
We just come in to peep at your toys.
You is so pimp, man.

233
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,896
- Did you see my face?
- What? No.

234
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,273
Did you see my fucking face?

235
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,732
No, we ain't seen your face.

236
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,905
Hey, hey, admit it. Don't lie to me.

237
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,323
You saw my face, right?

238
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,203
I might've seen your face.

239
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,579
Oh, God damn it!

240
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,579
- Yeah, I seen it, too.
- A very attractive face.

241
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,370
Shut the fuck up! God damn it!

242
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,416
You know what?
You two motherfuckers are like children.

243
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,338
You know, you're worse than my kids.

244
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,886
You do not know what you're doing.

245
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,926
Have you ever even robbed a bank before?

246
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,515
- Like dozens.
- Yeah.

247
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,761
We just pulled this job with
the Callahan Brothers in Dubuque.

248
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,478
- Now that was...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

249
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,978
What the fuck are you doing, man?
See, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

250
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,059
Don't tell me about the other jobs you pulled.

251
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,190
Don't tell me about the people
you pulled them with.

252
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,491
Don't rob a motherfucking bank
without a motherfucking mask.

253
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:08,069
Come on, guys, that's like, uh, Criminal 101.

254
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,162
It's like your tattoos, for instance.

255
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,953
- Oh. You like them?
- Check this out.

256
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,749
You can try and bind me,
but it ain't gonna hold.

257
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,793
(BOTH LAUGHING)

258
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,515
Oh, he didn't get it. Do it again.

259
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,645
No. No, no, no. Wow. No, believe me, I get it.

260
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,647
I think I need to speak slower to you two.

261
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,230
Generally, criminals try and minimize

262
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,486
their distinctive qualities.

263
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,618
So that they can't be identified afterwards.
Come on, guys, what the fuck?

264
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,796
You can try and bind me,
but it ain't gonna hold.

265
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,089
Get the fuck away from me. Both of you.
Get the fuck out of here.

266
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,587
Get the fuck out of here
before I put a bullet in both your asses.

267
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,013
We're going.

268
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,598
You stupid motherfuckers.

269
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,596
(DOOR OPENING)

270
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,762
Now, I know some of you have
husbands and wives

271
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,392
that are gonna panic
when you don't come home tonight,

272
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,849
so we're gonna give you each one phone call.

273
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,442
You will tell your certain someone

274
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,860
that you're spending the night
at a friend's house,

275
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,568
and you will be convincing
or I will blow your genitals off.

276
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,235
Who wants to go first?

277
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,485
You? How about you? No?

278
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,028
Okay, you with the ugly tie.

279
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,378
Hello, darling?

280
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,389
Number two is toast. Three is up.

281
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,439
We're 49 minutes behind schedule. Four-nine.

282
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,727

283

Mother-roo.

284
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,450
All right, now you know
how I usually get the blue stuff, right?

285
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,744
But this, this was on sale.

286
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,989
I love how thrifty you are.

287
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,075
Maybe we ought to read the directions
just to be sure.

288
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,755
What is that, Korean?

289
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,299
No, actually, now that's Chinese, see,

290
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,628
'cause Chinese is a pictogram alphabet.

291
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:33,632
Is it? Well, explosives is explosives.

292
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,389
I, um, am not gonna come

293
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,476
to the airport tonight. I am really sorry.

294
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,441
My mother is sick and I'm gonna stay
with her, and maybe we can go tomorrow.

And I love you. Goodbye.

296
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,150
- I don't have anybody to call.
- Nobody? That's really sad.

00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,906
Just kidding. Go fuck yourself.

298

This is the most pathetic group
of hostages I've ever seen.

- All right, sit down and shut up.
- Sit down and shut up.

00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,960
- I just said that.
- I was just reinforcing your message.

(SIGHS)

302
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,968
Well, as I predicted,

303
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,758
they didn't kill us.

304
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,465
- Tripp? Is it Tripp?
- Mmm-hmm.

305
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,846
Would you like to apologise
for scaring us all half to death?

306
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,973
Why didn't they kill us?

307
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,479
Why do they have to kill us?

308
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,683
They're gonna go down for murder already.
Why not kill all the witnesses?

309
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,312
It's the same charge.
Frankly, that's what I would do.

310
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,527
Well, maybe each gang thinks
that the other one did it

311
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,146
and so they don't have to kill us.

312
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,776
He was deliberately shot.

313
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,612
Until we figure out who he is
and why he killed Jack Hayes,

314
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,113
we're all totally fucked.

315
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,324
- How do you know his name?
- Driver's license.

316
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,122
You stole a dead man's wallet?

317
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,003
Mmm-hmm.

318
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,597
We're in. Gates, you're up.

319
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,856
Jesus Christ.

320
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,189
Remember when you just needed a gun
and a brown paper bag?

321
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,903
Tell me about it.

322
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,361
Do you see a clue?

323
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,413
No. I still don't know
what he does for a living.

324
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,325
There's no business card.
His credit cards and...

325
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,998
That's it, look.

326
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,547
Visa, Citibank,
but no Credit International card.

327
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,706
- So?
- So,

328
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,542
why was Jack Hayes in this bank
if he had no business here?

329
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,423
Maybe he was opening up a new account.

330
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,544
Damn it.

331
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,386
Let's see. Gordon and the
computer guy were over by the mainframe.

332
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,641
Madge was at her station counting money.

333
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,058
The creepy security guard
was standing by the door,

334
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,556
checking out the Swiss Miss,

335
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,645
who was sitting at the loan officer’s desk.

336
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,276
Kaitlin was at her station.

337
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,900
And Jack Hayes was...

338
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,610
No. Jack Hayes wasn't opening up
a new account.

339
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,444
He was loitering
at the cheque-writing counter.

340
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,654
If he was opening up a new account,

341
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,455
he would've gone straight
to one of the bank officers.

342
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,040
Then what was he doing here?

343
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,077
I have no idea.

344
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,505
Hey.

345
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,563
You are totally breathing on me.

346
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,909
What are you doing?

347
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,199
Hello, Tripp.

348
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,826
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for a way out.

349
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,790
Did you not hear the part
where they said they would kill us?

350
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,288
How come you haven't had your ring fitted?

351
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,036
- Excuse me?
- How long you been engaged?

352
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,163
Most women would know the answer
right away.

353
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,338
Why are you marrying Max?

354
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,506
You don't even know him.

355
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,341
I know that he's rich.
I know that he can't match

356
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,960
your hunger for adventure
or your sense of humour

357
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,052
and doesn't understand you sexually.

358
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,474
- She told me Max irons his jeans.
- Madge!

359
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,388
She's worked here two months already
and I've never met him.

360
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,639
- You know what? Enough.
- You know what?

361
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,137
There are four photos
taped to your teller station.

362
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,560
Three are of Brazil. You like adventure.
But Max is not in any of them.

363
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,017
He went with a banana hammock, okay,
and got a bad sunburn.

364
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,192
He stayed in that day.

365
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,562
Fourth one is of you and Max
in front of his mansion.

366
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,898
You look tiny compared to the house,
which tells me you like the house

367
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,028
more than the man putting you in it.

368
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,493
- You know what? Who are you?
- The most interesting thing about you

369
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,912
is that you still work here,
even though you don't need the money.

370
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,489
You're an independent woman. I like that.

371
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,037
- Damn straight, I am.
- I'm sorry. When I'm off my meds,

372
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,538
- I'm not that good with...
- People?

373
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,081
Especially ones I want to sleep with.

374
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,253
And I say things like that.

375
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,964
Oh, God.

376
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,187
Hey. Hey, asshole!

377
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,731
Stop it! Stop it!

378
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,855
- You're gonna get us all killed!
- Would you let go?

379
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,561
- Stop it!
- Rex, let go of my legs!

380
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,312
- Rex, let him go.
- He's gonna get us all killed!

381
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,614
- God.
- Just be quiet up there, son.

382
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,781
All right.

383
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,621
Hey!

384
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,533
They call me Mr. Clean.

385
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,043
So where you from?

386
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,664
- No English.
- Yeah?

387
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:22,428
I've never been to No English.
I hear it's right next to No Problem.

388
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,714
(LAUGHING)

389
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,178
There's a draught.

390
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,438
I'm good.

391
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,071
Make it rain, baby.

392
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:48,405
Rooty-tooty.

393
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,031
(BEEPING)

394
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,837
(SCREAMING)

395
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,639
(GROANING)

396
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,386
Mother-roo.

397
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,764
(GROANING)

398
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,820
Oh, fucking bollocks!

399
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,110
- We have got to kill them now, all right?
- Just relax.

400
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,983
Does the computer still work?

401
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,614
Yeah, it still works.

402
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,953
All right, now how much time
has that set us back?

403
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,828
About an hour or so. I say we forget the vault.

404
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,455
Let's just kill those muppets
and do the ATMs.

405
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,454
- That's blue collar.
- That's blue collar, dude.

406
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,173
Fine, all right, but we still
gotta kill them, all right,

407
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,291
because they're slowing us down.

408
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,965
Put a bullet in their fucking brain. Please.

409
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,888
Did we blow the ATM?

410
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,979
Jesus! Good to see your ugly face!

411
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:04,355
Dude, you just ate three bricks
of plastic explosives.

412
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,323
But did we blow the ATM?

413
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,192
Let me look.

414
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,621
Uh...

415
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,161
You want the good news or the bad news?

416
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,336
Good news.

417
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,003
The good news is we blew the door off.

418
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,677
The bad news is, these ATMs got

419
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,088
two doors.

420
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:32,846
GATES: On your fucking Knees! Go, go, go!

421
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,103
Hey, I ain't even pulled the trigger, man.
The thing just went off.

422
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,351
Hey, I don't care. Now on your fucking knees!

423
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,933
Okay, um...

424
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,647
- Face front?
- Face front!

425
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,904
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Hands on your fucking heads.

426
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,107
They're about to die, dude.
They probably don't need the echo.

427
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,109
You got any ideas, bro?

428
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,367
- See you on the other side, dog.
- That's it?

429
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,873
You're supposed to go
for the brainstem, right?

430
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,913
It's like less diffraction or something?

431
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,544
- Hey, dude?
- Yeah?

432
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,212
Been cool.

433
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,425
Yeah, totally cool.
Wouldn't have done it with nobody else.

434
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,211
Look, maybe this isn't our strongest play,
practically speaking.

435
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,217
Fuck, Weinstein, you said we could kill them.

436
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,886
Now just show me the spot.

437
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,972
Look, next time you guys are
gonna blow something up, you let us know.

438
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,395
Hey, you got it, bro.

439
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:22,104
And I just wanna thank you both
personally for not killing us.

440
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,318
Hang on. We're not doing them now?

441
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,487
You old fucks have completely
lost your heads!

442
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,897
(GUNSHOT)

443

(WOMEN SCREAMING)

444
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,239
What the fuck are you people
doing out of the kitchen?

445
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,867
Yeah, and they can fucking ID us now, man.
We have to kill them all.

446
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,619
(EXCLAIMING)

447
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,078
You missed, be-atch!

00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,499
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

449
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,796
No, he got you, bro.

450
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,790
What? I can't hear you, boy!

451
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,463
- Your ear!
- My what?

452
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,670
- Other ear.
- That's the one.

453
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,133
What?

454
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,260
Get ready to die, jism sucker.

455
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,137
All right, go ahead, shoot him.
Go ahead, do it.

456
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,437
- I will!
- Do it.

457
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,601
Then I'll shoot you and this retarded
cycle of violence can continue forever.

458
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,104
Go on, schmuck, do it.

459
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,273
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Are you trying to get me shot?

460
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,823
No, no, Peanut Butter, don't shoot him.

461
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,117
We're better than that, man.

462
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,704
Okay. Just gonna do a crawdaddy here
and back off.

463
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,956
Just backing on out.

464
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,509
Gates, move the hostages into
that office up there.

465
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,468
Just do it.

466
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,187
You okay, sweet cookie?

467
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,640
My sweet butter cookie?

468
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,993
- (YELLS)
- Jeez!

469
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,198
You killed Jack Hayes?

470
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,251
Why in the fuck is there
a hostage talking to me?

471
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,169
Somebody murdered him,
and they're gonna kill again soon.

472
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,543
Look, you're talking about the guy
in the windbreaker, it wasn't me.

473
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,670
I didn't have an angle on him.
How the fuck did you get out here?

474
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,509
- Who had the angle?
- Get the fuck out of here.

475
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,424
What are you doing here?

476
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,380
- Can you watch the hostages, please?
- Let's go!

477
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,137
All right! Just calm down.
You're really high-strung.

478
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,226
What you need is a sedative.

479
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,347
What is wrong with you? I have a gun
trained on the back of your head.

480
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,347
Yes.

481
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,938
What were you guys talking about in there?

482
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,271
He wanted to know if I thought
you killed the guy in the windbreaker jacket.

483
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,571
- Really?
- Yes.

484
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,616
- Did you?
- No.

485
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:37,944
- We're pros.
- Right.

486
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,246
If one of our guys killed that guy,
you hostages would all be as dead as him.

487
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,081
Right. He was also trying to figure out

488
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,747
why exactly two bank robberies
went down at the same time.

489
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,123
- What, are you joking?
- No.

490
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:51,082
At 7:00 p.m. the computer guy rebooted
the entire security system to new protocols.

491
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,924
- Right.
- The entire security system

492
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,297
was down for two minutes.

493
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,754
I'm shocked there wasn't
a dozen bank robbers in here tonight.

494
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,260
- Darrien should know that.
- Uh-huh.

495
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,849
He does know that, doesn't he?

496
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,560
And you're just trying to get
information out of me.

497
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,636
Yeah.

498
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,513
So did you kill Jack Hayes?

499
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,562
You know, in all my years of taking hostages,

500
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,481
you are by far the most annoying.

501
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,696
Right. Okay. I'm sorry.

502
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,321

(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

505
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,373
Hey, computer guy.

506
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,119
How come you only pressed 10 buttons
when you called your wife before?

507
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,293
What are you talking about?

508
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,959
When everyone else used the phone
they pressed 10 buttons

509
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,582
and then they pressed Send. So that's
11 buttons. But you only pressed 10.

510
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,084
I count everything, okay?

511
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,505
So how come you pretended to call your wife?

512
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,966
Because you sold the information
when the alarms would be down

513
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,514
to one of the criminals,
and then you got greedy

514
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,342
and you sold it again.
Double the cash, double the robbery.

515
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,642
That's why you didn't call your wife.

516
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,811
- Mitchell?
- Want that I should rough him up?

517
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,935
TRIPP: Yeah, it might be good practice
for when the cops show up.

518
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,104
Can we waterboard him?
I saw how to do it on the Discovery Channel.

519
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,857
I just need a mop and some tweezers.

520
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,937
No, no, no, hey, hey, hold it.

521
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,907
I did. I sold the downtime information.

522
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,652
- What?
- But I swear to God, I only did it once.

523
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,779
Okay? And I don't even know who to.

524
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,161
Yeah, I faxed the information.
They paid me in cash.

525
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,454
You've gotta believe me.

526
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,251
Why should we trust you?

527
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,962
No reason.

528
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,963
But I swear to God,
I never meant anybody to get hurt.

529
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,007
And I didn't kill Jack Hayes.

530
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,129
Nobody said you did.

531
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,021
Oh, Jesus Christ, we should be in by now.

532
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,519
Listen, old man, if you wanna
get out your stethoscope and bobby pins

533
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,976
and break into this vault 1970s style,
by all means, have at it.

534
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,273
Otherwise, shut your fucking face, all right?

535
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,735
Jesus fucking Christ.

536
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,278
Come on, baby.

537
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,532
Yes! I'm a fucking genius.

538
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,989
- Oh, good job, my man.
- The dog's fucking bollocks!

539
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,743
Wait, pan left. Pan left.

540
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,875
That's not right.

541
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:59,005
The vault specs said that the clutch
was 5 centimeters. That's way thicker. Shit!

542
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,553
What? How long is it gonna
take to burn through that?

543
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,722
I don't know. An hour or two?

544
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,715
- I mean, do all your jobs run this bad?
- Shit.

545
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,515
I mean, do I have to worry
if there's enough petrol in the getaway van?

546
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,766
Look at me, fucko. We're past the time lock.

547
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:11,938
We don't need you any more.

548
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,107
Are you threatening me, you bald little Jew?

549
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,903
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Relax!
- Bald little Jews have done more for mankind

550
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,896
than any other kind of person, ever!

551
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,113
So go fuck yourself!

552
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,941
Hey, go check on Peanut Butter and Jelly.

553
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,447
Make sure they're not doing
anything retarded. Go!

554
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,245
- Just go.
- Shit.

555
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,115
Relax.

556
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,914
It never ends. Three thousand years
we've been taking this shit.

557
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,460
Yeah, I know, man, I know.

558
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,220
I mean, it's not like I'm an accountant
or a comedy writer or something really Jewy.

559
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,384
I'm a fucking bank robber, for Christ's sake.

560
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,765
You know how many Jewish bank robbers
there are?

561
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,059
- Not many.
- Not very many!

562
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,725
And even in this work environment,
all they see is bagels

563
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,898
and shmear and Goldman Sachs.

564
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,726
Look, we're gonna burn through the clutch,
all right.

565
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,231
It's just gonna take a little bit more time.

566
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,946
I don't know, D.

567
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,234
We always said that we would bail on any job
if the intel sucked.

568
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,993
Already the vault specs are shit.

569
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,240
We're behind schedule.

570
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,785
Our number-three guy Lancelot
is a fucking psycho.

571
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,453
We got two hillbillies in the lobby

572
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,451
playing with weapons-grade
plastic explosives.

573
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,411
Our faces are in the open.

574
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,081
Ten years ago, we would've bailed.

575
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,423
You know I'm right.

576
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,463
Ten years ago we weren't in a recession.

577
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,010
Fucking bubble!

578
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,259
Look, look, listen to me.
I'm about to be 40 in a couple of years.

579
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,677
That's like 80 in criminal years.

580
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,475
Shit, I should be out of the game by now.

581
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,886
But fuck, man,
I need the money more than ever.

582
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,480
You know, I just got my little girl
some fucking braces?

583
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:36,815
- Yeah?
- Yeah, the Invisalign.

584
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,854
- No.
- Yeah, not that cheap ceramic shit, either.

585
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,106
- Nine grand a pop.
- Fuck!

586
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,478
Yeah, tell me about it.

587
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,480
And they call us criminals.
We should've been dentists.

588
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,607
- We should've been dentists!
- You're absolutely right.

589
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,785
Except, well, technically we'd be
orthodontists. But fuck that. Listen.

590
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,280
Go and take the hostages
on a bathroom break, all right?

591
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,328
I'll start on the clutch.

592
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,121
Look, man, we'll get through this.

593
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,128
All right? We always do.

594
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,464
All right?

595
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,473
Okay, so, we're gonna slide this C-4
into that door crack there

596
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,216
and punch the door out.

597
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,927
- Like opening a beer can.
- Yeah. Yeah.

598
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,398
Oh, you fucking mugs are
the worst bank robbers I've ever seen.

599
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,645
- Do you know that?
- JELLY: Yeah?

600
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,695
You Know, you just blew my ear off
like 15 minutes ago, so you'll pardon me

601
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,406
if I just let your little comments
go in one ear and out the other.

602
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,074
(LAUGHING)

603
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,824
What?

604
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,039
You only got one ear, bro.

605
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,542
Hey, it's an expression, dude.

606
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,494
I can't believe you're siding with him.

607
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,046
Listen, we cannot let them divide us, man.

608
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,335
You know they just trying to
lower our ranking.

609
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,638
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

610
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,215
You muppets are ranked?

611
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,720
You bet your sweet ass.

612
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,640
Yes, sir, we are. Higher than you, probably.

613
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,350
Oh, yeah? Do you wanna bet?

614
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,015
- Bring it on.
- Yeah?

615
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,145
Let's go.

616
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,185
GATES: Let's see where we're at.

617
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,438
I did not know they posted the rankings
on the Internets here.

618
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,694
Hey, Jelly, you remember that one website?

619
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,863
Yes. We got cyber-whipped.

620
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,530
- You ever been cyber-whipped?
- No, I have never been cyber-whipped.

621
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,540
PEANUT BUTTER: We got mixed feelings
about the whole experience,

622
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,125
but in a humdrum life,

623
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,086
you gotta take your fantasies
where you can find them, you know?

624
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,381
- See any clues?
- No, I need to get closer.

625
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,128
How are you gonna do that?

626
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,550
I'm working on it.

627
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,219
You doing okay?

628
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,894
Yeah. I'm good. Fine. I'm good.

629
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,305
What are you, like ADD or something?

630
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,435
No.

631
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,442
You don't have to be defensive, Tripp.
We've all got our own stuff.

632
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,565
I'm not squirreling away Xanax for nothing.

633
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,983
Why are you taking Xanax?

634
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,782
Uh, I don't know. Pre-wedding jitters, I guess.

635
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,484
That's because you know
Max is not right for you.

636
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,653
Oh, yes, right, of course.

637
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,909
That must be it. What do you take?

638
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,247
What don't I take?

639
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,665
Street or prescript?

640
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,290
Oh, prescription.
Never trust anything from the street.

641
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,589
What do you take it for?

642
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,919
All right, you don't have to tell me.

643
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,471
Shuts off the TVs.

644
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,967
Hmm. Interesting. Care to elaborate?

645
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,976
How do I explain this?

646
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,351
I've seen hundreds of doctors
and they've given me hundreds of diagnoses.

647
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,353
Without my meds, it's like...

648
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,775
It's like

649
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,363
I'm in front of a lot of TVs,

650
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,860
they're all on different channels.

651
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,784
A normal person can focus on one.

652
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,904
I have to take in all of them at the same time.

653
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,700
Can you turn them off?

654
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,160
No. I wish I could, believe me.
I've tried everything.

655
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,128
(FLUSHING)

656
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,624
Channel surf?

657
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:49,924
No.

658
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,593
- Drag.
- Yes.

659
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,923
Well, you know what they say.
Normal's just a cycle on the washing machine.

660
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,890
To the crazy person, the normal are insane.

661
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,735
GATES: Right, this is the FBI's Most Wanted
for banks.

662
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,984
Number one, Vicellous Drum.
Man, he's overrated.

663
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,533
I don't know, bro. Perfect getaway record.

664
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,203
Highest take-per-heist ratio.

665
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:22,324
And his jobs is planned to a T.
Run like fat people to the buffet.

666
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,164
Yeah, I know, but I mean,
look at that Baltimore job.

667
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,663
Twenty kills?
That seems, you know, excessive.

668
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,841
- Walked away with eight figures.
- Yeah, whatever. All right.

669
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,793
And number two is Mick Nylon and his crew.

670
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,430
And number three is Alexis Black
and she's pretty good for a girl.

671
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,758
And there's Darrien and Weinstein
at number 12.

672
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,344
Now, they've been at it for over 15 years,

673
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,391
so they have a lot more credits than me.

674
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,764
(CLACKING KEYS)

675
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,099
- And there's me, 68...
- Sixty-eight.

676
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,858
...in banks, but I'm 4 in cyber-grift.

677
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,606
Hey! Good for you, there.

678
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,034
Hey, you know what? Now I can go around
and I can say I got my ear shot off

679
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,488
by the fourth-best cyber-grifter in the country.

680
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,241
- Yeah, you could say that.
- Hey, you wanna shoot my pinkie off?

681
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,706
Did you just punch me in the arm?

682
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,083
Did he just punch me in the arm?

683
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,376
Okay, now, where are we ranked?

684
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,090
- Come on.
- All right.

685
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:18,422
We're number 674?

686
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:23,136
Well, they probably ain't took into account
that international job we just pulled.

687
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,555
- We hit a Jiffy Lube in Winnipeg.
- No, it's here.

688
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,438
You got picked up in Saginaw
after your car broke down.

689
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,227
Right. The engine gummed up.

690
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,071
What, your engine gummed up
after robbing a fucking Jiffy Lube store?

691
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,944
You know, it's not that ironic to us.

692
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,080
Oh, God. I broke the chain, man.

693
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,584
They're gonna fucking kill me.
Jesus God in heaven!

694
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,837
Relax. You can always turn
state's evidence and go to jail.

695
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,089
What? Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

696
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,586
Ah, the joint ain't so bad.

697
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,714
Really, it's not as gay as everyone thinks.

698
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,180
Well, for you it might be.
You're pretty rapeable.

699
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,304
(VOMITS)

700
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,600
Come on, man! Gross!
Hey, a little help in here!

701
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,272
(COUGHING)

702
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,436
They figure out you're the snitch, Mitch?

703
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,362
Let's go. Let's go. Move.

704
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,573
- Come on.
- Okay.

705
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,159
Go. Get out of here.

706
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,621
Gates, will you cover the bathroom break?

707
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,331
I gotta get this guy some Pepto.

708
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,418
Oh, sorry, guys. I shall see you later.

709
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:04,194
Set 'em up to knock 'em down.

710
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,164
Okay.

711
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,246
Yeah.

712
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:18,257
Well, guess you did blow the last one.

713
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:22,679
Well, now, you also took one for the team
with your ear and all, so...

714
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,715
I got an idea.

715
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,892
Hey, Bono!

716
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:31,938
What say we borrow one of the hostages?

717
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,807
They is half ours, ain't they?

718
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,898
You wanna pick teams or something? Eh?

719
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,115
- The hottie.
- Mother-roo.

720
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,201
Okay, we'll take the sort of quasi-hottie.

721
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,028
Oh, I think you're a full-on hottie.

722
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,826
GATES: All right, I'll take, uh...

723
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:53,535
Oh, fuck it, cue ball and creepy mustache
with me.

724
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,167
Black chick, freak show
and closet homosexual with them.

725
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,542
- What?
- I need to go to the lavatory.

726
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,628
Didn't you just piss? What, you gotta re-piss?

727
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,713
What, is there something wrong
with your willy?

728
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:09,051
No, I just... I need... I have e bit of e condition.

729
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,851
All right, fuck it, go on.

730
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,731
(DOOR CLOSES)

731
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,273
PEANUT BUTTER: Okay,
now for the sake of team spirit,

732
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,988
- we gonna be called the Badgers.
- Mystic Lightning!

733
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,612
What? No, not Mystic Lightning.
I hate that name.

734
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,325
Oh, so, what, badgers are cool?

735
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,996
Badgers are tunnel-dwelling rodents
who live on garbage and poop, dude.

736
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,914
They are not inspirational animals.

737
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,080
Bro, you got to choose
Peanut Butter and Jelly. I get this one.

738
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,086
Fine.

739
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,548
Okay, so, for our first activity,

740
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,544
we need one very special badger,

741
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,920
preferably who can read Chinese,

742
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,804
to detonate some totally not dangerous
explosives for us.

743
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,095
Dude, if you ask like that,
no one is gonna volunteer.

744
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,478
- I'll do it.
- What?

745
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,101
(WHISPERING) I need to see Jack Hayes.

746
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,978
- See?
- All right.

747
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,272
The man is dead.
There's nothing you can do for him.

748
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,986
- Oh, my God, you like me.
- I do not like you.

749
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,605
- This is really unexpected.
- Oh, my God, I don't like you.

750
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,486
I really didn't think I had a shot.

751
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,199
How is Max gonna react to this?

752
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:10,745
You know what? Fuck off. Go get maimed.
See if I care. Go on, beat it.

753
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,580
- I'm not gay.
- This is not the time.

754
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,785
(DOOR CLOSING)

755
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,265
Okay, now here's what's supposed to happen.

756
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,727
You jam the igniter into the C-4,

757
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,772
you stroll casually to a safe location,

758
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,436
and I press the detonator.

759
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,897
Here's what's actually gonna happen.

760
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:45,280
Igniter into C-4, huge explosion,

761
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,823
and you get launched across the bank

762
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,654
and we find you in a pile of rubble. Okay?

763
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,163
Good luck.

764
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:04,003
Okay, bro, good to go!

765
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,714
(EXHALES)

766
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:11,427
- He is not the smartest badger.
- No.

767
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,815
(BEEPING)

768
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,120
Huh.

769
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,794
Mother-roo.

770
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,894
Son of a bitch!

771
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,565
New rule! From here on out,
we only rob human beings.

772
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,600
This is fucking ridiculous.

773
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:21,542
Locked! Of course they're fucking locked.
Of course.

774
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:25,080
Why does this bank hate us?

775
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,675
Oh, I found some nickels.

776
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:34,214
Fucking nickels.
Stupidest goddamn coin on the planet.

777
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,639
Hey, Jelly.

778
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,515
Things is looking up.
I just found us a bunch of nickels.

779
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,603
(MUTTERING) They shot him from there.

780
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,973
Went through him this way...

781
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,184
Drop the gun, bro.

782
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,188
You heard the man. Drop it.

783
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,945
Put the gun down! Put it down!

784
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,444
Put the fucking gun down, dude.

785
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,824
Yo! Earth to dude!

00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,614
- Drop the fucking gun!
- Drop the fucking gun!

787
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,244
Put the fucking gun down!

788
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,661
- Drop the gun!
- Drop the gun, dude!

789
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,707
What the fuck are you waiting on?

790
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,375
(ALL CLAMORING)

791
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,165
PEANUT BUTTER: Put the gun down!

792
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,791
Guys, what's up?

793
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:13,170
Drop the gun.

794
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,471
This? I found it on him.

795
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:21,854
I ain't interested in the fucking provenance
of the gun. Just put her on the ground.

796
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,314
You gotta be kidding me.

797
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:33,323
Dude, I know that we're sort of
the junior varsity team around here,

798
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,534
but we'd appreciate it
if you'd surrender your weapon to us

799
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,953
when we're holding you at gunpoint.

800
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,327
This fucking thing is FBI issue.

801
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,830
FBI? That's interesting.

802
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,714
Wait a minute.
An FBI agent tried to rob this bank too?

803
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,210
Or he was here investigating somebody.

804
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,678
We have at least five wanted criminals
in this bank. Right?

805
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,969
What the fuck is going on here?

806
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,217
- Bingo.
- You got it?

807
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:03,181
Nope.

808
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,563
I found that missing piece to your ear.

809
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,687
Now, if you gotta faint, I got ya.

810
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:11,687
Okay. Peanut Butter and Jelly came
through the front door there.

811
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,271
Darrien and Gates came down the stairs there.

812
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,573
Bullets flew north-south.
The blood splattered east-west.

813
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,197
If he got caught in the Crossfire,
it'd be north-south.

814
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,028
Darrien and Gates were on the wrong axis.

815
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,741
So were Peanut Butter and Jelly.

816
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,749
The FBI guy, Jack Hayes, was dead center.

817
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,167
With him in that position,
only two guys could've shot him.

818
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,875
Mitchell the computer guy.
But he wasn't armed.

819
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,929
So if you eliminate that option,
there's only one other possibility.

820
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,382
The murderer must be

821
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,303
Weinstein.

822
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,602
(ALL GROANING)

823
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,397
- Weinstein?
- Yeah.

824
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,073
- You absolutely sure?
- Absolutely.

825
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,573
Weinstein, what's your 20? Oh, shit.

826
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,753
Oh, Shit.

827
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,760
Shit, they shot each other.

828
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,175
No, no.

829
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,425
There's no fucking way that this asshole
was able to draw faster than Weinstein.

830
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,260
No way. And where the fuck could
he get a gun and a silencer?

831
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,058
What do you make of this, here, spaceman?

832
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,017
I reckon that Weinstein's pissed because the
computer guy invited two parties to the heist,

833
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,319
and the computer guy, he's mad
because Weinstein killed the FBI guy.

834
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,022
And they both confront each other,
both draw, both die.

835
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,487
Why would Weinstein confront him now?

836
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:41,484
Surprise the bastard.

837
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,195
And why would Weinstein kill an FBI agent
in the middle of a bank heist?

838
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,450
To surprise the bastard.

839
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,995
Weinstein had the computer guy at gunpoint
when he came into the kitchen,

840
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,663
but the computer guy got two shots into him.

841
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,537
Well, maybe someone surprised
somebody else in some other manner.

842
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,964
What if it wasn't a confrontational moment?
What if they were allies?

843
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,040
Hey.

844
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,794
You better watch your fucking mouth
when you talk about my friend.

845
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,004
He would never turn on me, ever.

846
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,724
We've been working together
for 15 years now.

847
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,976
And that means something
in this fucking business.

848
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,638
Besides, the only people that had access
to the kitchen were, uh,

849
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,015
only Peanut Butter, Jelly and...

850
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,565
- And you, Gates...
- Oh.

851
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,271
...had access to the kitchen.

852
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,114
And the hostages upstairs in the ceiling.

853
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,989
Wait a minute. The hostages are crawling
around in the fucking ceiling now.

854
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,529
You see that? This is it. This job is over.

855
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,832
No, no, wait, wait. You, wait here!
Darrien. Darrien, mate, listen.

856
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,700
Listen to me, all right?

857
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,768
That's kind of weird.

858
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,391
Hmm.

859
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:03,150
Well, PB, what are we gonna do now?

860
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,867
I got nothing, bro.

861
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:10,373
Except I'm gonna get this piece of ear
into the freezer up there.

862
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:16,705
Buddy, I swear, if you was a woman,
I'd marry you.

863
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,291
Well, I ain't.

864
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,145
Whoa, bro. You coming downstairs with me.

865
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,066
Where's the clicker?
We need it to get out of here.

866
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,478
So there are a couple more dead bodies.
That means we change the plan, all right?

867
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,279
It doesn’t mean we call off the job.

868
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,820
The plan? You know what they say
about plans, don't ya?

869
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:45,991
No, what do they say?

870
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:49,445
They say if you wanna make God laugh,
tell him all about your fucking plans.

871
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,617
And believe me,

872
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:53,537
that motherfuckers up there
laughing his ass off at us right now,

873
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,494
because ever since we entered
this miserable fucking bank,

874
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,122
nothing has gone according
to the goddamn plan!

875
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,585
Now where's the goddamn clicker?

876
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,753
Weinstein had it, all right?

877
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,459
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
But where did he put it?

878
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,135
I don't know where he put it.
All right, listen, Darrien.

879
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,805
Just listen to me, all right? Just calm down
and listen to me, all right?

880
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,673
We should've gotten out of here
a long fucking time ago.

881
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,475
- No, no, listen, mate.
- it's over.

882
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,972
We need that to bust the clutch, yeah?

883
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,595
Yeah, well, I need it to cut my way out.

884
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,477
Don't fuck me over here, right, 'cause
I wanna stay here and do this bank.

885
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:18,941
The bank job is a bust!

886
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,643
It's not a fucking bust. Listen to me, all right.

887
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,730
Me and you sitting on a desert island
somewhere, "sucky-sucky, 5 dollar,"

888
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,189
lots of birds, all that sort of shit.

889
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,195
Think about it.
It's a good fucking option for you, mate.

890
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,275
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

891
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,157
Oh, look, Darrien, come on, mate.
You blow the fuck...

892
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,113
Darrien! Come on, man.

893
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:34,616
The bolts are retracted. It's just a motor left.

894
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,997
- This will drastically...
- Get the fuck off me!

895
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,211
Look this will drastically
affect your rankings, mate.

896
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,004
That's all I'm fucking saying, all right.

897
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,633
And I thought you people had balls!

898
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,836
You're a fucking disgrace
to black criminals everywhere!

899
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,005
Fuck you.

900
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,641
Shit! Fucking shit!

901
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,779
GATES: I know tonight's been
a complete and utter fuck-up.

902
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,990
But not any more! No, no.

903
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:16,165
Now there is only one robbery team,
the three of us.

904
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,492
Hey, can we be Mystic Lightning?

905
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,704
No, you can't be fucking Mystic Lightning,
you muppet.

906
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,295
(GRUNTING)

907
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,550
No more bathroom breaks.
No more perks, no more cushy treatment.

908
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,549
This shit just got really fucking real!

909
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,766
And because there is now only one army,
there is now only one general.

910
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:40,606
Me, all right? I'm the fucking general.

911
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,064
I'm in complete control.

912
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,903
Nothing happens here without me saying so,
all right?

913
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,069
(SCREAMING)

914
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,115
(ALL SCREAM)

915
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,706
Oh, fucking come on.

916
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:01,369
Honestly, I don't know why I fucking bother.

917
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,507
Now go on, take the hostages
up the office. Go on.

918
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,046
Go on.

919
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,382
All right, everybody, you heard the man.

920
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:18,602
Come on, come on, get moving.
Everybody up the stairs. Let's go, let's go.

921
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,017
Did you rig his blowtorch?

922
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,934
No, I fucking didn't. And I suppose
you wankers didn't either, right?

923
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:25,934
Nope.

924
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,491
So what's next? Do we start with the vault
or do we kill all the hostages?

925
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,404
Oh, uh, definitely the vault.

926
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,366
We find that having hostages around
can be real handy.

927
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:44,332
You can use them as human shields,
or they can fetch stuff for you, like

928
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,540
- bags of money or snacks.
- Fine.

929
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,210
All right, we start with the vault
on one condition.

930
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:56,345
When the time comes to do 'em,
I get to do 'em all.

931
00:52:58,092 --> 00:52:59,139
Yeah?

932
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:03,806
Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.
We ain't really into mass murder.

933
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,233
But if that's part of your MO.,

934
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,189
that's totally cool with us.

935
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,354
All right, let's do it.

936
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,317
Yeah? Come on, let's get to work.

937
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,325
(SIGHS)

938
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,417
You okay?

939
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:27,997
Oh, I'm great. This is so much better
than flying first class,

940
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,873
drinking champagne, going to my wedding.

941
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,631
If you could walk out of the bank
with the money, would you still need Max?

942
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,180
Oh, God. Seriously, Tripp,
you have got to let this go.

943
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:37,973
I can't let anything go. I'm obsessive.

944
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,059
If you had the money,
would you still need Max?

945
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,136
Yes, I would.

946
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,187
- What, to open the door for you?
- Sure.

947
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,227
- To cuddle you at night?
- I'm not so big on cuddling.

948
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,558
Take you to Mom and Dad for the weekend?

949
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,985
- My mom happens to love him.
- You know what the problem is?

950
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,730
Everybody says money can't buy happiness,
but nobody actually believes it.

951
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,324
Tripp, your persistence is touching.
It really is.

952
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,652
But at 5:00 a.m. I walk out of here
and go back to Max.

953
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,320
So you're saying I have until 5:00 a.m.

954
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,247
No! That is not what I'm saying.

955
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:06,998
GATES: Now, since the torch is blown,

956
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,460
we'll use a controlled blast
with your C-4 on the clutch there.

957
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,758
Oh, we all about the controlled blast.

958
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,586
Yeah, that'd be a nice change of pace.

959
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,968
And I just want you lads to know that
I'm not just using you for your explosives.

960
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,557
Oh, we ain't thought that.

961
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,725
Just go and check on that now.

962
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,275
- Ro-sham-bo?
- Okay.

963
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,401
But no pee, no sneak attacks,
no dynamite, no Apache helicopters,

964
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,703
- and no nuclear weapons.
- Just go and check on them, all right?

965
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,577
And kill whoever's up there.

966
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:52,214
Dang! He always throws scissors.

967
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,709
Why do I go with paper? Why, Jelly?

968
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:58,797
Why do you always go with paper? You know
he's going with scissors. Go with rock.

969
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,100
Yo.

970
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:11,980
Hello.

971
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,529
Anybody in here?

972
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,736
Hmm?

973
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,628
Hey, man.

974
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,123
I know you're in here.

975
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,125
I don't wanna shoot you, Tripp. Okay?

976
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,626
I just...

977
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,840
I just wanna rob banks.

978
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,352
And I don't know what's happening any more.

979
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,270
With the heist?

980
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,271
Yeah with the... With the heist.
With everything.

981
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,149
I should be the happiest guy in the world
right now.

982
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,148
I got a great job. I work with my best friend.

983
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,699
The hours, they're ideal.

984
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,360
But we never had to shoot people before,
you know?

985
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,286
We never had to kill anybody before.

986
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,915
Man, can you please just come out of there?

987
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,090
You know, it's weird saying all this stuff
to a photocopier.

988
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:20,719
- Look, I am not trying to be negative, okay?
- Okay.

989
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,804
It's... All I'm saying is

990
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:28,685
maybe I'm not good at robbing banks,
you know?

991
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,726
Maybe this is not what Jesus put me
on this earth to do.

992
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,854
I mean, my grandfather, he sold moonshine

993
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,857
My father was a repeat sex offender.

994
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,234
I mean, being a criminal is in my blood.

995
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,779
But between you and me,

996
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:48,038
it's always been my dream
to work in a water park.

997
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:50,745
I hear you.

998
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,749
You know, for whatever it's worth,
I think you're a really great bank robber.

999
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,914
- You mean that?
- Mmm-hmm.

1000
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,924
I mean, you're not just saying that
'cause I got a gun pointed at your dick?

1001
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,300
No, no. Listen. Nothing that has gone wrong
here tonight is your fault.

1002
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:05,760
You're being sabotaged.

1003
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,342
Here, look. Look at this. Easy.

1004
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,349
- I'm gonna show you something. See?
- Hey!

1005
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,555
Hey, where'd you...

1006
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,182
Oh, man, where'd you get those?

1007
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,355
I stole these from your suitcase earlier.
But listen.

1008
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:21,655
Look, watch. Even with...
Even with a foreign bandwidth interference,

1009
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,116
the detonator should work. Watch.

1010
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,072
Nothing. Who modified this for you?

1011
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,704
- Our point man. Are you okay?
- No. Who's your point man?

1012
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,417
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'm not supposed to tell you that.

1013
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,036
Whoever modified these is trying to kill you.

1014
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,046
It's either your point man or...

1015
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,755
- How well do you know Peanut Butter?
- Hey, bro!

1016
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,589
Me and Peanut Butter, we're like brothers,
you understand me?

1017
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,221
- Yeah! Yeah!
- No, actually my brother is a prick.

1018
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:52,937
Me and Peanut Butter are like a couple of
best-friend gay dudes in a bathtub.

1019
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,522
That's how fucking tight we are. Okay?

1020
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:59,060
Look. There's a lot of money at play.

1021
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,687
You have to look at all the angles.

1022
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:06,283
You know, he did know about that freezer

1023
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,276
even though we had never been
in that kitchen.

1024
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,280
Then again, it is a kitchen.

1025
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,119
- Touché.
- Who's your point man?

1026
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:18,253
Look at me, man. I'm a fucking mess.
You can trust me. Who's your point man?

1027
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,752
All right, fine, here. There. Look at it.

1028
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:29,010
Name's Vicellous Drum. We never met him.

1029
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,638
But his cheques cleared
and his info was straight.

1030
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,768
Never saw a face, just a fax.

1031
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,095
Is getting a fax normal?

1032
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,474
(SCOFFS) Yeah, yeah, you think
everybody'd be into the e-mail, right?

1033
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,477
Nah, see. The cops,
they got a million ways to track that stuff,

1034
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,939
but they kind of skipped
on the anti-fax technology.

1035
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:49,618
You know? Plus, it... Everybody likes
the convenience of a hard copy.

1036
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,079
KAITLIN: I don't mean to frighten you,

1037
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:57,835
but do you think there could be something
to this conspiracy theory?

1038
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,458
(WHISPERING) Well, I don't wanna...

1039
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,591
I don't wanna impugn anyone's character,

1040
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,720
but the other night
I caught Rex measuring the vault.

1041
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,344
I asked him what he was doing
and he said he was trying to see

1042
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,767
if there was enough room
for the new foreign currencies.

1043
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,973
- Oh, my God, that's so weird.
- It is.

1044
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,971
He would know when the system was down.

1045
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,933
Oh, my God, he would.

1046
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:25,021
Well, and of course, as he's had to tell us
multiple times, he's an expert

1047
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,322
at bank-robbery procedure.

1048
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,899
- You're right.
- But, Mr. Blythe...

1049
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,734
- What?
- ...he is such a dork.

1050
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,081
Anyone seen my glucose shot?

1051
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,749
(SIGHING)

1052
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,415
- Oh!
- KAITLIN: Get a chair!

1053
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,669
Oh, my gosh. Oh! You're gonna be okay.
Oh, my goodness.

1054
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,719
Does anybody have any sugar? Rex?

1055
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,803
No, I don't snack.

1056
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,966
KAITLIN: Okay, hold his head. Hold his head.

1057
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,764
Fire! Fire!

1058
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,937
Fire!

1059
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,605
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where's the fire?

1060
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,603
This man needs a glucose shot

1061
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,855
and otherwise he's gonna die,
and I'm gonna go get it

1062
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,273
and you can't stop me. Come on, everybody.

1063
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:09,448
Okay, but where's the fire?

1064
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,734
TRIPP: So, do you work with
this Vicellous Drum guy a lot?

1065
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,032
Yeah. We were decoys for him once.

1066
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,124
He had us rob this Jiffy Lube
while he pulled this big heist downtown.

1067
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:23,379
Bummer is this lube place
has got, like, no cash in it.

1068
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,214
I mean, we scored like 80 bucks Canadian.

1069
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,758
Hey! Oh, Mr. Blythe is having a diabetic fit.

1070
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:31,337
We have to find his shot.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1071
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:39,511
Where's my gun?

1072
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,485
Check under the ledges.
That's where we hid contraband in Joliet.

1073
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,813
Stuck it under there with gum.

1074
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:53,074
Wait. You're an ex-con
and you're guarding this bank?

1075
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:56,115
Yeah. I might've taken
a few liberties on my resume. (LAUGHS)

1076
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,788
- What were you in jail for?
- Not bank robbery.

1077
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,578
I committed other victimless... You know?

1078
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,659
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mail fraud. I did a lot of mail fraud.

1079
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,743
Mmm-hmm.

1080
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,830
- Fine, but they weren't even big banks.
- How many banks have you robbed?

1081
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,540
A few dozen.

1082
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,546
- Oh, my God.
- Relax.

1083
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,386
I'm rehabilitated and shit.

1084
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,423
So, what's your deal? You single?

1085
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,639
TRIPP: I think I found it.

1086
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,481
KAITLIN: Oh, my God.

1087
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,908
Wow, his pulse has come back already.

1088
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,906
(GASPS) He's starting to open his eyes.

1089
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,124
REX: He's a tough old bird.

1090
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:45,960
- Wanna sit up?
- Ready?

1091
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:52,134
All right, I'm closing this door
for the last time. Are we clear?

1092
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:57,306
I said, is that clear, you fucking cunts?

1093
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,675
Oh! Oh, I don't... I don't like that word.

1094
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,931
- What did you just say?
- I don't like the C-word.

1095
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,855
Now you try saying that one more time
and I'll out your...

1096
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,524
I said I don't like the C-word!

1097
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,977
And in America we never use it!

1098
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,937
Oh, good, the fucking hostages are armed.

1099
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:14,690
He got the same type of gun
that you do, Jelly.

1100
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,067
(CLEARS THROAT) That is my gun, dude.

1101
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,904
I suppose you'll be needing this?

1102
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,656
What the fuck is that?

1103
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,459
That is our way out of here.
So what do you want, a cut?

1104
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,832
A conversation outside. Let's go.
Hands over your heads, now!

1105
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,414
Hands over your heads. Let's go, outside.

1106
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,666
(ALL SHOUTING)

1107
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,379
Calm down now, calm down,
you fucking maniac. All right?

1108
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,880
- Tell me about your point man.
- Why?

1109
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,179
Unless you have something to barter with,
you will answer my fucking questions!

1110
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,477
All right, all right.
Weinstein was our liaison, all right?

1111
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,436
- I never met our point man.
- How did you communicate?

1112
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,230
- I'm not gonna tell you that.
- Do you wanna get out of here?

1113
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,852
Do you wanna get out of here? Just do it!

1114
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:50,900
- Answer the question!
- All right. Listen, listen. Look.

1115
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,941
This fax was all we got, all right?

1116
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,861
Now, I'll trade you for the Clicker.
All right, there it is.

1117
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:58,859
- Nice and slow.
- All right, stand up!

1118
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,783
- Now give me the Clicker. Give me the clicker.
- Here's the clicker.

1119
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,204
All right.

1120
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:07,584
- Now give me the fucking gun.
- Whoa! Now, that's Jelly's gun.

1121
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,081
It was his mother's.

1122
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:12,539
Your mother's gun?

1123
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,712
Your mother gave it to you?

1124
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,345
All right, I'm sorry. All right.

1125
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,262
What, are you giving the
fucking hostages your gun now, eh?

1126
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,259
- No, I didn't...
- Are you a fucking...

1127
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:27,934
Have you lost your fucking marbles?
You just lost your gun privileges. Go on.

1128
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:29,848
Go on.

1129
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,183
Jesus. And you.

1130
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,903
If I hear one more fucking peep
out of you, one,

1131
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,947
- then you're a dead man, all right?
- All right.

1132
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,567
- Now get your arse back in there.
- All right, thank you.

1133
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,742
I'm in.

1134
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,487
Jesus.

1135
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,947
Now let's get back to work.

1136
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,408
- Oh, my God!
- What is that all about?

1137
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,331
I just traded the key out of here for this fax!

1138
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:53,755
- And that's a good trade?
- I don't know. That's why I kept the battery.

1139
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,540
Look.

1140
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,589
Listen. Mr. Blythe told me that he saw Rex
measuring the inside of the safe,

1141
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,512
and I noticed that when I asked for the chair,
Swiss Miss brought it right over.

1142
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,215
Speaking of Swiss Miss...

1143
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,929
Hey, Swiss Miss is missing.

1144
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,181
Oh, my God, it's happening.

1145
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,016
- It's happening.
- What is happening?

1146
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,312
- it's happening.
- What?

1147
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:12,478
The faxes. The night-vision goggles.

1148
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:14,943
- Oh, my God, the fucking faxes. The goggles.
- What are you talking about?

1149
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,521
- 155, 70...
- Tripp, stop counting.

1150
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:20,778
- Those faxes... The gun... Huh?
- Tripp, stop! Stop!

1151
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,366
- What?
- Why the fuck did you do that?

1152
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,698
Because I thought it would
help clear your mind.

1153
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,533
No, it doesn't work like that!

1154
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:30,829
For fuck's sake.

1155
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,544
I got 8,000 things going on
in my mind right now,

1156
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,213
and I have to think about the kiss, too?

1157
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,460
Are you kidding me?

1158
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,884
Oh, my God, my brain is gonna explode!

1159
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,836
Oh, God!

1160
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,139
(WHIMPERING)

1161
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:53,231
The dude's crazy but he is very gifted.

1162
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:56,936
I know. He is a bona fide criminal mastermind.

1163
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,279
We're blessed.

1164
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,986
Can we help you?

1165
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,326
Yeah. Get you, you know, like a diet soda?

1166
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:09,239
Will you please just go anywhere else?

1167
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:20,675
One hour left.

1168
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,339
We're gonna make it here, team. I told you.

1169
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,798
So far the only people
that have been killed are criminals.

1170
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:29,180
And they can all go fucking kill each other,
for all I care.

1171
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,012
We're survivors.
Or as I like to call us, hero-vivors_

1172
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:37,647
Everyone, starting tomorrow,
you are getting one week's paid vacation.

1173
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,816
Son of a bitch. I already got next week off.

1174
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,277
Well, then, we're gonna have to
give you another week.

1175
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,024
Thank you.

1176
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,657
We're not safe yet.

1177
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,035
You're that upset
that you were wrong and I was right?

1178
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,207
No. Oh, no!

1179
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,492
(KAITLIN SHRIEKS)

1180
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:58,547
Oh, my God! Oh, God.

1181
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,715
TRIPP: Wait. What’s that in her bra?
MR CLEAN: I'll get it!

1182
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,218
(ALL PROTESTING)

1183
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,469
- Okay.
- Do it.

1184
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:06,671
Oh, this is really gross.

1185
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,927
TRIPP: Go ahead. Pull it. Pull it out. Nice.

1186
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,266
BOTH: She works at a Swiss bank?

1187
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,267
(DOOR OPENING)

1188
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:25,236
Oh, man. What a waste.

1189
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:29,281
PEANUT BUTTER: It's like extra sad
when a hot chick dies.

1190
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:33,577
When a ugly chick dies, it's like,
their life probably sucked anyway,

1191
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,657
so it's no big deal.

1192
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:38,120
But when a hot chick dies,
it's, like, totally tragic.

1193
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:42,795
I know, I mean, hot chicks,
they're like unicorns or leprechauns.

1194
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:46,595
They're rare and they're precious
and they need to be protected.

1195
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,097
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What?

1196
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,800
This is not a robbery.

1197
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:10,452
This is not a robbery! This is not a robbery!

1198
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,621
You're a fucking dead man.

1199
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:15,786
Hakuna matata, motherfucker!

1200
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,208
(CLICKING)

1201
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,671
Just hear me out
and I will return your firing pin.

1202
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,794
All right, yeah.

1203
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:27,468
These are the two faxes
inviting both your teams to rob this bank.

1204
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,337
This is a fax inviting Swiss Miss here.

1205
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:30,463
They're all completely different

1206
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,636
except each one has a blemish
that appears every 3.2 inches.

1207
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,843
It is made when the printing drum
has a scratch on it.

1208
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:36,310
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

1209
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,974
Each one was printed by the same machine?

1210
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,848
You were all invited here by the same person.

1211
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,849
The same person, who?

1212
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,897
- Vicellous Drum.
- MADGE: Who's Vicellous Drum?

1213
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:47,277
The number-one criminal mastermind
in the world.

1214
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,065
He's stupid smart.

1215
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,239
This is not a bank robbery.
This is an organized ambush.

1216
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:53,410
Vicellous Drum has a problem.

1217
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,868
He's gotta kill a bunch of people
who are all connected to him

1218
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:57,657
but he can't look like he's behind it.

1219
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,918
So you're saying that each of us here
is connected

1220
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:02,917
to this Whatever Drum person
for some reason?

1221
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,919
Yes. Here, let me lay it out for you.

1222
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:08,589
If I am right about this,
the FBI agent has been after Drum for years.

1223
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,883
Darrien and Weinstein worked
for Drum before.

1224
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,553
The Swiss bank representative
launders Drum's money.

1225
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,638
Mitchell Wolf is Drum's computer hacker

1226
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,265
Peanut Butter and Jelly have
worked for him as decoys.

1227
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,930
Each one of them could rat him out.

1228
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,515
And as for the rest of you, who knows?

1229
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,566
Maybe Mr. Blythe denied Mr. Drum a loan.

1230
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:25,731
Maybe Madge
and her kind, wonderful, warm tones

1231
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,107
offended Mr. Drum in some way.

1232
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,860
Maybe Mr. Clean flirted with him
in a prison shower

1233
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,700
Give one blowjob in prison
and you never live it down, never.

1234
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,072
Maybe we're all here by accident.

1235
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,536
Like me, just collateral damage.

1236
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,614
Oh, you have gotta be kidding me.

1237
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,540
Lock us in a bank
and hope we all kill each other?

1238
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,955
I mean, that is a sloppy plan,
especially for Drum.

1239
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,504
Which is why he's here, in person.

1240
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:45,830
Oh, come on.

1241
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,883
Just think about it.
The blowtorch, the explosives,

1242
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,636
they all went off at exactly the right time.

1243
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,801
The FBI agent was obviously
the biggest threat to Drum,

1244
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,599
so he had Weinstein take him out first.

1245
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,438
See, that's right. Weinstein
was working for Drum from the beginning.

1246
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,899
So was Mitchell, who knew
when the security system would be down.

1247
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,567
And so Drum killed them next.

1248
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,611
(GUNSHOTS)

1249
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,238
Drum did his best to make it look
like a double murder

1250
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,157
But the clicker that was in Weinstein's mouth

1251
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,538
was a big red flag
that something strange was going on.

1252
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,912
My best guess is that Weinstein must've
hid the clicker in his mouth

1253
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,957
to prevent the real killer, Vicellous Drum,
from getting out of the bank.

1254
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,796
Next, Drum took out Darrien
with a rigged blowtorch.

1255
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:33,177
And then Drum shot the Swiss Miss.

1256
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,253
(GUNSHOTS)

1257
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:36,180
Five down, only eight to go.

1258
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,100
Oh, that is fucking bullshit. You know what?

1259
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,645
That's a nice little story you told, sunshine,
but I've got a vault to blow.

1260
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:45,937
It's not gonna open up. Listen to me.
The money's like flypaper.

1261
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:49,110
It's just a lure to get you here
so Drum can kill you.

1262
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,945
Come on, hell,
there's no money in the bank at all!

1263
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,648
Of course there's fucking money in a bank.
Don't even say that.

1264
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:57,198
No way, dude.
We have worked way too hard for this.

1265
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,779
You are not listening to me.
This is not a bank robbery!

1266
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,078
(ALL COUGHING)

1267
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,715
Well, this is the best damn
non-bank robbery I've ever seen.

1268
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,640
And you said there's
no money in the vault, eh?

1269
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,009
You just don't get it. It's flypaper.

1270
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:22,685
Yeah, eat your words, freak show.

1271
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,567
Mother-roo.

1272
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:33,150
Oh, my God!

1273
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,191
Oh, my God!

1274
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,323
So it doesn't matter that the money is here?

1275
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,696
Vicellous Drum is still gonna
try to kill everybody?

1276
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,248
Yeah. I can't believe nobody's starting
to lose their mind right now.

1277
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:46,580
(GUN COCKING)

1278
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,416
I don't know which one of you
is Vicellous Drum.

1279
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,792
You stay the hell away from me.

1280
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:10,892
Aren't you gonna get a gun?

1281
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,067
No, it doesn't matter.

1282
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,061
Drum's plan was always to
take out numerous armed targets.

1283
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,859
Our only hope is to outthink him.

1284
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,698
So how do you kill a bank full
of armed people?

1285
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,118
Cut off the lights, strap on the night-vision
goggles and take everybody out.

1286
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,571
Jesus Christ,
how'd you come up with that idea?

1287
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,031
In the office you said something about
there being night-vision goggles.

1288
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,537
- Yes, there's a pair in the bathroom.
- So what more do you need?

1289
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,040
Whichever guy goes for the goggles
is Vicellous Drum.

1290
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,996
Or whatever girl.

1291
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:43,387
Drachmas? How the fuck
we gonna fence drachmas?

1292
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,893
(CHUCKLES) Hey, how much you think
we've got here?

1293
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,891
Oh, I reckon about 4 or 5 loads.

1294
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,814
So, let's get cracking, eh? Chop-chop.

1295
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:01,238
Really? Now you decide to save the bank?

1296
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,158
No, man, I wanna go with you.
There's a fucking murderer in here!

1297
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,077
Well, I'm going too. I'm totally freaked out.

1298
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:09,246
- I wanna go with you.
- Don't forget me, motherfuckers.

1299
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,539
Oh, so we're all here.

1300
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:12,962
Why don't we hold hands
as we go up to the roof, eh?

1301
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,587
It's no use, guys.
You're never gonna get out of this bank alive.

1302
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,093
Oh, would you not say ominous shit like that?

1303
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,091
You gonna spook Jelly.

1304
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,257
Actually, Tripp's right.

1305
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,976
Your key won't work.
There's no battery in that Clicker.

1306
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,803
(CLICKING)

1307
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,601
Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

1308
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,894
Now which one of you bastards
has the battery!

1309
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,934
Vicellous Drum.

1310
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,149
- You took the battery to keep us here.
- No...

1311
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,196
Plus you spent half your time
wandering around the bank.

1312
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,153
You could've killed anyone at any time.

1313
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,659
And what's more mastermindish
than setting up the perfect crime

1314
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,161
and then trying to solve it bit by bit?

1315
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:53,127
I cannot believe I kissed you.

1316
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,960
Doesn't take a mastermind
to get under your skirt, sweetie.

1317
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,291
Oh, don't flatter yourself
that you'd ever get that far.

1318
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:01,215
And the rest of you idiots,
if you'd been paying any attention at all,

1319
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:04,514
you would've realised that all
the evidence points to Madge!

1320
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:06,799
No, it don't!

1321
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:12,980
(GROANS)

1322
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,660
MADGE: (SCREAMS)
Who turned out the lights?

1323
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:29,330
GATES: Oh, come on. What the fuck?
Not again.

1324
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:32,166
PEANUT BUTTER: Shoot anything that moves.
Unless it's me.

1325
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,289
JELLY: It's Drum. it's fucking Drum.

1326
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:40,000
(SCREAMING)

1327
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,005
Vicellous Drum.

1328
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,236
Where is he?

1329
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,079
We ain't seen dick-all, bro.

1330
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,500
Drum?

1331
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:36,931
(BEEPING)

1332
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,407
Come on out.

1333
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,613
Come on out!

1334
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,361
PEANUT BUTTER: Come on, Drum.
Come on out.

1335
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:54,491
It's not me. I'm telling you,
I am not Vicellous Drum.

1336
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:58,586
I shut off the lights because I knew the real
Drum would go for the night-vision goggles.

1337
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,624
Then I went up to the bathroom and I waited.

1338
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,509
Oh.

1339
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,937
The sick kindly bank manager
with the heart of gold.

1340
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,891
Everyone's gonna be shocked
when they hear it's you.

1341
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,690
You think so?

1342
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:27,322
Those clowns in the lobby
think you're Vicellous Drum.

1343
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:32,116
So if I kill you, I look more like a hero.

1344
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:36,617
And you kill me, you look
even more like Vicellous Drum.

1345
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,081
So either way, you're just fucked.

1346
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,961
(GROANING)

1347
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:55,267
MR BLYTHE: Very entertaining story, Drum,
but no one's gonna believe it.

1348
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:59,351
Come on out. No more lying.
The game is over.

1349
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,394
KAITLIN: Not so fast.

1350
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:09,024
Tripp and I set you up.

1351
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,071
We knew when the lights went out

1352
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:14,495
that whoever went for
those night-vision goggles was our guy.

1353
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:25,669
You can't kill all of us.

1354
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:26,881
Can he?

1355
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,171
No.

1356
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,927
One million dollars each.

1357
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,717
Untraceable.

1358
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,856
All of you.

1359
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,941
Two million dollars.

1360
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:49,898
TRIPP: Put the gun down!

1361
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:52,821
Put the gun down and we'll talk.

1362
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,370
Ah, fuck it.

1363
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,838
And then there were six.

1364
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,403
- Here, the Clicker.
- Thanks, bro.

1365
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:37,236
Well, I guess that's all she wrote.

1366
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,628
Take it.

1367
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:48,172
- It's insured.
- Mmm-hmm.

1368
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:57,090
FDIC, baby. You got to love the New Deal!

1369
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:00,392
PEANUT BUTTER: (CHUCKLING) Mother-FOO.

1370
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,137
Thanks, badgers.

1371
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,972
I just wanna say one thing.

1372
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,442
From here on out,
me and Jelly is going straight, ain't we?

1373
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:12,147
Yeah. Straight to the Hooters in Cancun!

1374
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,489
(WHOOPING)

1375
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,496
I almost forgot my ear. (LAUGHS)

1376
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:29,163
So after all that,

1377
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:32,167
two guys named Peanut Butter and Jelly
got away with all the money?

1378
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,839
Yeah. It's crazy stupid.

1379
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:37,255
I think they said they
were fleeing to Winnipeg.

1380
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:38,847
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1381
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:40,015
- You are free to go.
- Thank you.

1382
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,218
All right, lock down all northbound routes.

1383
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,303
- Here are your meds, sir.
- Oh.

1384
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,938
Oh, I'll take the Whole thing.

1385
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,143
Suzie, hero is not a word that I would use.

1386
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:53,316
Did I lead my team of hostages through
the darkest night of their lives?

1387
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,235
Yeah, I did my job.

1388
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,316
- I want two months off, paid.
- Yes, ma'am.

1389
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:01,700
I wanna wear jeans five days a week,
not just Friday. And I want LASIK, both eyes.

1390
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,494
Really, guys, you don't have to do this.

1391
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:05,491
It's not a problem, ma'am.

1392
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,201
Well, thank you.

1393
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,749
Thank you.

1394
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:16,885
- There you are, ma'am.
- Good to go.

1395
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:19,179
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Officers.

1396
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,052
Thanks again, Officer.

1397
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:23,634
(GASPS)

1398
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,142
- Oh, shit.
- Wow, what is this?

1399
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:28,851
Is it a toaster?

1400
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:32,026
Is it a gravy boat?

1401
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:36,940
Ooh. Wow, some people like to give cash.

1402
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,610
I never quite bought your cover story.
Didn't ring true.

1403
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:44,113
Then I remembered
Weinstein said he was shocked

1404
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,790
that only two bank robberies
were going down tonight.

1405
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,334
And then I realised there were actually three.

1406
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:50,957
Pretty solid plan.

1407
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,794
Kaitlin Nest, plucky new feller
who married the wrong guy.

1408
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:56,546
Such a sympathetic story.

1409
01:19:56,917 --> 01:20:00,046
Your fake fiancé Max
explains your expensive tastes.

1410
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,597
Your history of exotic travel

1411
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:04,011
explains your sudden trip
to a non-extradition state.

1412
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,765
And your phoney wedding presents
allowed you to walk out of the bank

1413
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:10,139
with hundreds of pounds of cash
without anyone raising an eyebrow.

1414
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,099
You were gonna make your move
around 7:00 p.m.

1415
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:13,396
when all the security went down.

1416
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,569
But Darrien and Drum
and everyone else derailed your plan.

1417
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,191
(LAUGHS) You must've been so pissed.

1418
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:21,234
But you bided your time,
waiting for your opportunity.

1419
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,452
And when I killed the lights,
you took your shot.

1420
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,006
Take it.

1421
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,553
- It's insured.
- Mmm-hmm.

1422
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,966
It's genius, actually.

1423
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,936
No one's gonna open up
a woman's wedding presents.

1424
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:53,398
And then to have the cops carry the money
out of the bank and into the trunk of your car?

1425
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:56,936
Honestly, I think I'm in love with you.

1426
01:20:58,437 --> 01:20:59,609
Too soon to say that?

1427
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:01,611
What do you want, Tripp?

1428
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:04,155
- Isn't it obvious? I want in.
- Really?

1429
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,653
Equal partners. We only work the long con.

1430
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,495
No violence, no bodies.

1431
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:08,956
What makes you think I won't kill you?

1432
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,408
You're not the killing kind.

1433
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,118
Besides, you like me.

1434
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,211
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so. it'll be fun.

1435
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,629
You already know we'd make a great team.

1436
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,210
What do you say?

1437
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:22,965
Are you gonna freak out?

1438
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:25,305
I don't know what you mean. What?

1439
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,976
The last time I kissed you,
you freaked out and it was pretty pathetic.

1440
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:38,985
What's your real name?

1441
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:41,356
Alexis Black, number three in banks.

1442
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,236
Oh, that's so fucking hot.

1443
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,496
(INAUDIBLE)
