getting what I deserved.

in the world,

206

it sort of cancels out the bad.

207
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:30,943
I think I would need
to save a busload of nuns

what's turning out to be

714
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,677
a very hard-earned reward.

715
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:34,589

this asshole to the wall.

716
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,459
I promise you...
for Deb.

called by your given name,

Daniel Vogel?

720
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:54,441
You know, there are several
ways we can do this.

721
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:57,311
Given that we have footage
of you killing other people,

722
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,378
it would be
in your best interest

723
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:00,213
to cooperate.

724
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:02,114
It's up to my lawyer
how cooperative I am.

725
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:03,115
Are you sure?

726
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:04,817
Because if you have any hope

of staying out
of the electric chair,

728
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,354
you should probably
start talking.

729
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:09,822
Just fuckin' admit it.

730
00:35:09,823 --> 00:35:13,058
You killed Cassie,
you killed Clayton.

731
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:14,393
And you shot Deb.

732
00:35:16,362 --> 00:35:18,296
How did you hurt your arm?

733
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:20,632
This?
It's just a scratch.

734
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:23,768
No.

735
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:26,671

737
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:32,376

you fuckin' shot her!

738
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:33,977
And you left her there to die!

739
00:35:33,978 --> 00:35:35,646
Just like you killed
your own mother,

740
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:38,148

to make a case against Saxon.

748
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:11,513
I could leave now for Argentina

749
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:15,183

with a slight headache,

of what he did to Deb

that I went in there.

00:49:15,714 --> 00:49:18,149
[Thunder rumbles]
Please.

897
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,517
Okay, here.

- Hi, Harrison.

00:49:24,722 --> 00:49:25,955
I just want to tell you
one last time

900
00:49:25,956 --> 00:49:27,824
that I love you.

901
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:29,226
I love you too.

902
00:49:29,227 --> 00:49:32,195
I want you to remember that
every single day

903
00:49:32,196 --> 00:49:33,463
until I see you again.

904
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:34,931
Daddy loves you.

[Thunder rumbling]

910
00:51:32,275 --> 00:51:36,011
I destroy everyone I love.

911
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:38,780
And I can't let that happen
to Hannah,

912
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:40,415
to Harrison.

913
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:44,686

I have to protect them from me.

916
00:51:59,668 --> 00:52:00,934
Good morning, Miami.

917
00:52:00,935 --> 00:52:02,370
Hurricane Laura has passed

918
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:04,070
and everything is going
back to normal.

919
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:06,139
There is no longer any threat.

920
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,407
[Newscaster speaking Spanish]

921
00:52:07,408 --> 00:52:09,209
Hurricane Laura
is slowly dissipating

922
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,110
over the Atlantic.
She is heading south...

923
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:12,879
The majority of destruction
is along the harbor.

924
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,747
There have been some reports...

925
00:52:14,748 --> 00:52:17,050
The cleanup has begun
as the city returns to normal

926
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,918
with coast guard teams going
as far north as Daytona Beach

927
00:52:19,919 --> 00:52:21,820
- and as far south...
- Cutter 6, go ahead

928
00:52:21,821 --> 00:52:23,489
and turn to your 1:00.

929
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,424
There's something there.
I can't make it out.

930
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:26,692
Give me a time.

931
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:28,160
Stopping in five seconds.

932
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:30,729
- Okay, I think we got a visual.
- Copy that.

933
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,764
Turning northwest.

934
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:37,068
We've surveyed the wreckage.

935
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:39,704
There doesn't appear
to be any survivors.

936
00:52:39,705 --> 00:52:42,006
We're heading back.

937
00:52:44,743 --> 00:52:46,344

939
00:52:47,646 --> 00:52:49,247
This is
the U.S. Coast Guard.

940
00:52:49,248 --> 00:52:51,215
We just wanted to call
and report the wreckage

941
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:52,816
of Dexter Morgan's boat.

942
00:52:52,817 --> 00:52:54,718
Dexter?

944
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:15,137
[Sighs]

945
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:31,353
Hey, uh, how about we go
get some ice cream, yeah?

946
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:33,564
