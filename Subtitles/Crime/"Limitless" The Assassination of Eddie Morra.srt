1
00:00:00,824 --> 00:00:02,461
Previously on Limitless...

2
00:00:02,462 --> 00:00:04,091
It's about time you and me talked.

3
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:06,585
- Do you know who I am?
- Everybody says you're gonna be president soon.

4
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:08,895
But between me and you, I don't
even know if I'm gonna run.

5
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:10,296
The world needs to be willing to change.

6
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:11,698
And it takes leaders who are willing

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,766
to cut through the noise and play the game

8
00:00:13,768 --> 00:00:15,401
- and win the game.
- And that's you?

9
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:17,136
I think so.

10
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:19,639
You belong to Mr. Morra now, which means

11
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,341
you belong to me.

12
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:24,277
When I'm on NZT, I can think
through all the different

13
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,746
- angles, every perspective.
- Then shouldn't you have known

14
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:29,082
that I was gonna shoot Casey?
You texted me.

15
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:30,783
Yeah, I... I didn't think you'd shoot.

16
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:33,086
Lower your weapon.

17
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:34,854
But I did.

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,638
Sorry, ma'am, gonna have
to take a quick peek.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,374
The senator's giving a
speech a few blocks down.

20
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,008
Senator?

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,411
He, uh, holds office in one
of two legislative bodies

22
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:00,446
that make the laws for this country.

23
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:02,181
I know what a senator is.

24
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,650
Have a nice day, ma'am.

25
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,664
Sir?

26
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,766
They're ready for you.

27
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:56,836
Okay.

28
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,233
Thank you.

29
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,702
Thank you. Please, sit down.

30
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,138
You know, when the wars were done,

31
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,207
they didn't scrap this ship.

32
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,142
They found a new mission for her.

33
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:38,845
The Intrepid was used as a recovery vessel

34
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:40,780
- Piece of glass just caught the light.
- For the Gemini and Mercury...

35
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:42,582
Could be someone with binoculars.

36
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:45,351
I'd like to give the same
dignity to our veterans

37
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:47,620
that we gave to this ship.

38
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:49,555
Someone's taking a shot at me.

39
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:52,758
Call it 3,300 yards.

40
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:57,196
That'd be the longest kill of all time.

41
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:58,931
I hire as many vets as I can...

42
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,333
NZT.

43
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:01,834
Piper.

44
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,669
She'll breathe out before she shoots,

45
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,404
so let's think this through.

46
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:08,241
Not on the table, obviously.

47
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:10,475
I could jump out of the way.

48
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:11,476
__

49
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:13,513
Not bad.

50
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,780
But what if the bullet just grazes me?

51
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:17,281
__

52
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:18,885
Yeah.

53
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:20,419
That'll do.

54
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:55,187
They need you upstairs right now.

55
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:03,763
I saw the news. Of course I did.

56
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,698
The whole city was talking
about what happened

57
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,899
to Senator Morra.

58
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,067
Let's review all the ways

59
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,435
this could go wrong.

60
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,904
Ah. Jarrod Sands, this is Brian Finch.

61
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:13,839
He consults with us on priority cases.

62
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:16,742
Mr. Sands is a security consultant

63
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:18,311
for Senator Edward Morra.

64
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:19,912
Brian and I know each other.

65
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:23,783
We are in a clandestine relationship.

66
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:25,151
The senator and I

67
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:27,320
give him immunity from
the side effects of NZT

68
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,322
in exchange for him reporting back to me

69
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:32,058
on what you lot get up to.

70
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,694
That explains so...

71
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:36,262
so much.

72
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:38,030
Should we just arrest him now, then?

73
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:39,665
If you like.

74
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,368
Or I could take care of him round the back.

75
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,904
Okay, it's not in his best
interest to take that approach,

76
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:46,205
but Rebecca is wicked smart.

77
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,008
What if she figures it out?

78
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,144
The senator's sorry he
can't be here personally.

79
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:54,313
Anything my team can do to assist you.

80
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:57,316
Great. We should also address the fact

81
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:59,919
that you are in a clandestine
relationship with Brian.

82
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,488
I'm guessing you give him immunity

83
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,656
to NZT's side effects

84
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:05,625
and he tells you what we're up to?

85
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:08,060
That is so not true.

86
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:10,429
They know.

87
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:12,898
Once I'm in the car, nuke
the building from orbit.

88
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,901
Yeah, it's the only way to be sure.

89
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:20,573
I imagined it all kinds of different ways.

90
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,875
Can we talk about Senator
Morra's eyes for a second?

91
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:24,276
Amazing, right?

92
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:25,878
Blue.

93
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,782
But what really happened was
Sands basically ignored me.

94
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:31,717
And they talked about hate mail.

95
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:33,986
Senator Morra has some powerful enemies

96
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:35,855
from a few different conglomerates,

97
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:39,592
but personally I'd be surprised
if they'd make a play for him.

98
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:41,427
Was there any evidence at the scene?

99
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:44,430
No evidence was found
at the sniper's nest,

100
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:45,564
and the only information we got

101
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:47,266
from the two security guards on the scene

102
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:48,701
was a basic description of the woman

103
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:50,202
who they think was the shooter, so...

104
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:52,838
Yeah, unfortunately, we've
had to use private security.

105
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,274
It's the best I can do
until the senator decides

106
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:56,809
whether he's gonna run for president.

107
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:58,944
We'll interview everyone
who works at the hotel.

108
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,546
Thank you, everyone.

109
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:04,116
The senator will be sincerely
grateful for your help.

110
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:06,619
- Rebecca?
- Mm-hmm?

111
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,921
Can I have a word, please?

112
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:13,459
How are you holding up?

113
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,061
I'm all right.

114
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:20,666
Boyle was the one who
had to pull the trigger.

115
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:24,270
But you were dating Casey
Rooks, were you not?

116
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:28,441
But it wasn't serious, so
that's why I never filled out

117
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:30,443
the "Status of Relationship" HR form.

118
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:31,844
I...

119
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,348
They're gonna make this
an issue, aren't they?

120
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,384
Like I was trying to hide something.

121
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:39,585
No, they're not.

122
00:06:39,587 --> 00:06:42,421
Because you're gonna sign the form now,

123
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:44,890
you're gonna back-date it,
and I'll make it official.

124
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:47,793
Why would you do that?

125
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:49,528
Because you told me the truth.

126
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,598
And I don't think you did anything wrong.

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,968
Rook's actions were entirely his own.

128
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,370
The form is just a bunch of lawyers

129
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:00,339
trying to save their asses.

130
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,642
Thank you.

131
00:07:03,644 --> 00:07:05,111
Oh, please.

132
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:06,979
I've been single ever
since I joined the Bureau.

133
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,081
Do you think I haven't
slept with anyone here?

134
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:11,350
We're busy.

135
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:13,185
How else are we supposed to meet people?

136
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:23,796
Eyes front, mate.

137
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:25,631
They got cameras in here.

138
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:26,866
I'll tell you everything.

139
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:28,634
If we get a name, you'll
have it right away.

140
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:30,469
I was gonna e-mail you.

141
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,771
Can you hit 15 for me, please?

142
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:33,939
Some friends of mine lately,
we've been playing

143
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:35,474
this board game called Arkham Horror.

144
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,843
It's this cooperative thing
where you work together

145
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:40,579
to defeat the monsters
of the Lovecraft canon.

146
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,181
We could always use a fourth.

147
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:46,085
Oh, sorry, you're probably really busy.

148
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,988
You always
come off as so desperate.

149
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,023
Hey, James, you know what?

150
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,525
That actually sounds pretty awesome.

151
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:54,760
Just give me a text, okay?

152
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:57,596
Oh, wait, I don't have your number.

153
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:00,966
We've got a name.

154
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,803
The woman who tried to shoot
Mr. Morra is Piper Baird.

155
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,271
So you already know who did it.

156
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,405
We're fairly certain.

157
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,507
Piper used to work for Mr. Morra.

158
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:11,577
The parting of ways was not amicable.

159
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:16,348
We supplied her with NZT
until she went a bit mad,

160
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,585
declared war on Mr. Morra and
anyone associated with him.

161
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:22,288
She's been a terrible pain, to be honest.

162
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,024
We're gonna find her, and we're
gonna sort the problem out.

163
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:27,426
But in the meantime,
your job is to make sure

164
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:30,229
that the FBI never learn
the name Piper Baird.

165
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:33,465
So you want me to sabotage
the investigation?

166
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:36,202
If the FBI finds this woman before we do,

167
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:38,637
she can tie the senator to NZT.

168
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,541
Which means Mr. Morra
goes to jail or flees.

169
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:46,979
Which means no more booster shots for you.

170
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:51,250
If she manages to get to Mr.
Morra before we get her...

171
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:53,352
No more booster shots.

172
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:01,961
Until we have Piper Baird,

173
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:04,296
your fate is tied to Senator Morra's.

174
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:05,831
Do what you need to do

175
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,667
to keep them far away from that woman.

What happened with Casey
wasn't anybody's fault but his.

00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,158
that's almost as ridiculous

180
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,893
as somebody trying to put it on me.

181
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,461
Boyle is still upset.

182
00:09:50,463 --> 00:09:52,663
I told him he didn't need to kill Casey.

183
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:54,298
I'm guessing I'll be hearing
about it for a while.

184
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,200
I paid attention with one ear

185
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:58,269
but mostly spent the drive
learning more about the woman

186
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,505
I was supposed to be make
sure Boyle never found.

187
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:03,508
Now I don't know what a typical
assassin's background is,

188
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,710
but I'm pretty sure it
doesn't involve a scholarship

189
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:08,312
to study neurochemistry at Johns Hopkins.

190
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:11,048
Completely normal childhood,
good kid, great student,

191
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,783
but when her mother's Alzheimer's got bad,

192
00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:15,453
Piper dropped out of
school to take care of her.

193
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:17,788
After that, there wasn't much about her.

194
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,124
Not until 14 months ago, anyway.

195
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:22,994
Her boyfriend was stabbed to
death while he was asleep.

196
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,062
Piper was in the apartment, but she ran

197
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:26,597
before the police got there.

198
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,933
She's their top suspect.

199
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:32,103
Spelman?

200
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:33,804
What was that for?

201
00:10:33,806 --> 00:10:36,440
You had that "zoned out"
look while I was talking.

202
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:40,945
...private security...

203
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:43,047
a woman between five four and five six

204
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:46,517
carried eight or so shopping
bags into the suite...

205
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,786
didn't leave much behind
in the way of evidence...

206
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:51,589
A woman brought the rifle in
with a bunch of shopping bags,

207
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:53,324
and we don't know anything else. That it?

208
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:57,662
You know, that "I barely listen to
anything you say" recap thing you do?

209
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:59,764
It's rude.

210
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:14,712
There was no evidence
at all in the suite...

211
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:16,213
Piper's thorough...

212
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:18,482
But I couldn't stop staring at something.

213
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:20,718
There's fresh ink on this drawing.

214
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,553
Actually, I think it's eyeliner.

215
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:24,055
It's barely even dry.

216
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:26,624
I wouldn't have noticed it
if it wasn't for the NZT,

217
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:29,794
which I think is the point...

218
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:31,996
Someone's testing me.

219
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,703
That's Piper.

220
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:40,671
She's on NZT.

221
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,506
Why does she need the laser?

222
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:44,542
Why risk tipping me off?

223
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:47,645
She knew I'd have to be on
NZT to notice the painting.

224
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:49,880
Unless...

225
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:54,552
Dot, dot, dash.

226
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:56,153
That's Morse code.

227
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:58,296
She's sending me a message?

228
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,817
__

229
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:07,031
You okay, Finch? You look kind of pale.

230
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,833
I'm okay.

231
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:11,235
Any brilliant insights?

232
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:13,404
Yeah.

233
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:17,008
The shooter apparently used the balcony.

234
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:23,247
How did we even function
before you came along?

235
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:24,615
Okay, let's head back.

236
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:26,917
All right, I want you to
review the security footage.

237
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,920
See if you have any more of
those... penetrating insights.

238
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,025
Find Sammy DiPietro?

239
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:37,928
She might as well ask me to find Bigfoot.

240
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,733
DiPietro was a union leader
with ties to the Mafia.

241
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:44,402
He vanished in the '70s.

242
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:47,371
Everyone assumes he's dead,
but no one's ever found the body.

243
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:51,942
And why does Piper want
to talk to me, anyway?

244
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:56,113
Okay, you see that, right?

245
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:57,848
Piper's good, but she
couldn't keep her face off

246
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,583
all the security footage.

247
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:01,385
You got to trim those frames out,

248
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:04,021
and you got to find everything
you can about Sammy DiPietro.

249
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:06,624
I don't know why, but Piper's testing you.

250
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:09,260
And if she says you can find
DiPietro, then you can find him.

251
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,438
You heard Sands, man.

252
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,708
You don't have a choice.

253
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,477
Yeah, I know.

254
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,813
It's just that...

255
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:32,283
working against the FBI,
betraying Rebecca...

256
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:36,220
Every time I do that,
it gets a little bit easier.

257
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:44,195
You sure you're not
slowly turning into Finch?

258
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:46,230
Building models with colored yarn?

259
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:49,934
Actually... it's a diagram.

260
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:53,804
But I see your point. Where is Brian?

261
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:55,840
Said he was running down a hunch.

262
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:58,776
For what it's worth,
he seems pretty off his game.

263
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:01,846
Well, maybe he's internalizing
your attitude towards him.

264
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:03,314
He's very sensitive.

265
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,715
Nah, we're fine.

266
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:06,283
How'd it go with Naz?

267
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:08,085
All good. We just...

268
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:09,887
We're finishing up some paperwork.

269
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:12,590
I had some time to do some research.

270
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:13,891
These represent

271
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:16,761
the five longest confirmed
sniper shots of all time.

272
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:18,462
The record belongs to a British officer

273
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:21,532
who served in Afghanistan: 2,700 yards.

274
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:24,902
He beat second place by
a whole football field.

275
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:27,805
This represents the deck of the Intrepid

276
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:30,541
and the hotel where the shot was fired.

277
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:34,211
3,315 yards.

278
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:36,947
She took a shot that would
have beaten the old record

279
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:39,183
by six football fields.

280
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:40,384
Wow.

281
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:42,086
The round was standard.

282
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:43,888
It was fired from an off-the-shelf rifle.

283
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,823
There was no new technology.

284
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:48,759
Nobody could make that shot.

285
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,995
Well, maybe she had some help.

286
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,064
Can you think of anything
that would help someone

287
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:56,600
do something that was otherwise impossible?

288
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:59,537
You're thinking the sniper was on NZT.

289
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:02,106
It's a lot of red yarn.

290
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:05,910
Yeah, and your tape's not as clean
as the way Brian would do it.

291
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,847
"Find Sammy DiPietro."

292
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,983
Sounded impossible at first,
but when you can plow

293
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:14,852
through 50 years of files
in a couple of hours,

294
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:17,888
interesting things can present themselves.

295
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:21,659
Fritz Wunderlich?

296
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:22,960
You know, I was always

297
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,962
more of a Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau man myself.

298
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:27,631
As far as German opera goes.

299
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,333
What do you want, kid?

300
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:32,236
I know you're Johnny "Opera" Velardi.

301
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:34,572
What gave it away?

302
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:36,907
I know you have ties to
the Lotito crime family.

303
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,542
Allegedly. Mmhmm.

304
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:41,612
I'm just a retired truck driver.

305
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:42,913
I know.

306
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,915
And you drove the truck
that carried the body

307
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:47,885
of Sammy DiPietro in a steel drum

308
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:51,889
from where he was murdered
to where they stashed him.

309
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:54,658
Been questioned about
it 15 different times.

310
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,961
Who are you?

311
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:59,797
You certainly
don't look like a Fed.

312
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,765
It's a long story.

313
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,701
Let's just say I'm a concerned citizen.

314
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:07,338
To be clear, I don't think you killed him.

315
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,606
In fact, you probably didn't even know

316
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:09,874
what it was you were transporting.

317
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:14,178
I just want to know where you
drove the truck that night.

318
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,147
Kid, that was 40 years ago.

319
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,550
Even if I could remember
where I drove that truck,

320
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:22,253
why would I start talking
after all this time?

321
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:24,588
'Cause I'm gonna make you
an offer you can't refuse.

322
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:28,492
This is a bootleg that even
you don't have, Johnny.

323
00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:31,795
You didn't know it, but
you were wire-tapped

324
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:34,298
for almost 20 years by the FBI.

325
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:45,743
That's your wife.

326
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:50,180
She's singing to your
son when he was a baby.

327
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:53,150
It's beautiful.

328
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:56,120
It's Puccini.

329
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:58,589
I was sorry to read what happened to her.

330
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:00,958
You know, my aunt had leukemia.

331
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,594
That is the master copy,

332
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:05,596
and it is all yours if you just tell me

333
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,464
where you drove the truck that night.

334
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:12,603
No one will ever know we talked.

335
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:19,510
The night Johnny "Opera"
delivered his truck

336
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:22,179
with its mysterious cargo, he came here.

337
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:24,748
He said a new concrete
floor had been poured.

338
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,118
So somewhere
in all this concrete

339
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,321
lies the body of Sammy DiPietro.

340
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:32,456
But that's not why I'm here.

341
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:44,802
Obviously this is where
Piper's been hiding,

342
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:46,870
but where is she?

343
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,576
__

344
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,821
__

345
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:24,909
Mom?!

346
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,910
Dad?!

347
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,711
Hey! Brian!

348
00:18:27,713 --> 00:18:28,712
Hi!

349
00:18:28,714 --> 00:18:30,381
Hi.

350
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:32,850
Is everything okay here, guys?

351
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:34,551
Of course. Come, sit.

352
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,393
We're just getting to
know your new girlfriend.

353
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:51,086
What's wrong, Brian?

354
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,088
Nothing, it's just...

355
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,356
I'm surprised to see you.

356
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:55,490
Here.

357
00:18:55,492 --> 00:18:57,158
With my family.

358
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,595
How could you not tell us
that you had a girlfriend?

359
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,564
He had this whole
elaborate plan to introduce us.

360
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:05,233
I just... kind of got tired of waiting.

361
00:19:05,935 --> 00:19:08,673
Yes, well, our Brian likes
to do things in his own way.

362
00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:10,427
On his own time.

363
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:13,027
That's okay, I-I think I got
him pretty well figured out.

364
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,563
Piper was just telling
us about your first date.

365
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:17,831
Oh, yeah?

366
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,468
Ah. Oh, well, I assume you're
both gonna stay for dinner.

367
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,104
Oh... I don't know yet, Mom.

368
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,178
Piper...

369
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,181
quick word on the porch, please?

370
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:31,551
Thanks, we'll be right back.

371
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:36,156
I was sensing some tension
between you and your dad.

372
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:37,457
What did you do?

373
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,993
Listen to me, my family
is not a part of this.

374
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,261
You can't really believe that.

375
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,497
Not after being around Morra for this long.

376
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:47,868
Did you tell anyone I was here?

377
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,103
Relax, I just need to know
if you're telling the truth.

378
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:52,639
Does Sands know where I am right now?

379
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,408
No.

380
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,249
I'm not here to threaten you.

381
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:03,650
I'm not gonna hurt your parents.

382
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,319
I just don't have much time.

383
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:06,687
I had to learn everything I could

384
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,155
about the person Morra is working with.

385
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:09,956
Yeah? What did you learn?

386
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,726
Classic middle child, which
explains your need for approval.

387
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,128
On the other hand, your fears of living up

388
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,464
to your successful older
siblings caused you to rebel

389
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,266
and reject mainstream success.

390
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:21,301
"Resorbed Twin."

391
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,303
You really thought that
was a reasonable band name?

392
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:25,772
The most important thing I learned is

393
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:27,774
that you grew up surrounded
by love and support,

394
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:30,410
which suggests a strong moral framework.

395
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:33,113
Why do you care if I have
a strong moral framework?

396
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:34,514
And how long were you in there for?

397
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:35,816
Seven minutes.

398
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,118
And I care because I know how Morra works.

399
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,254
He has a way of corrupting good people.

400
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:41,755
You're one of them.

401
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:43,890
Same way I was.

402
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:48,028
So it's his fault that you
killed your boyfriend?

403
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,597
I didn't kill my boyfriend, Brian.

404
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,099
Morra did.

405
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:53,433
Or his people.

406
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,469
And why would they do that?

407
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:59,439
He came to me when I was
writing my dissertation.

408
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,108
I guess he'd read some of my work.

409
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,743
He told me about NZT,

410
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:04,411
how he was trying to
alleviate the side effects

411
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,046
and how, if I could help him do it,

412
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:08,682
the pill might help my mom.

413
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:13,453
You invented the enzyme?

414
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:15,889
Well, me and some other people.

415
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:17,324
I don't know who they are.

416
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:19,559
Morra kept us all separate.

417
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:21,862
He has this way of...

418
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,998
making people think he's a good person.

419
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,301
How, no matter what he does,

420
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:30,070
it's all for some greater good.

421
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:33,674
And one day, I stopped believing

422
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:35,876
that it was about anything other than him.

423
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,980
So I stole a supply of
NZT and the enzyme...

424
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:45,452
and he framed me for
killing Colin as retribution.

425
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:48,155
That's when I decided
he needs to be stopped.

426
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:51,625
You're running out.

427
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:54,695
Of NZT, or the enzyme, or both.

428
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:56,096
You know, something about the attempt

429
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,431
on Morra seemed desperate.

430
00:21:57,433 --> 00:22:00,000
He has been on NZT longer

431
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:01,568
than any human being alive.

432
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,038
You had to know that he
would see that coming.

433
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,374
But you couldn't wait any longer

434
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:10,077
or you might miss your one shot forever.

435
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,446
I'm close to replicating the enzyme,

436
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:15,182
and when I get there, his
plan to keep NZT to himself,

437
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:16,550
to keep it from doing all the good

438
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:17,918
you and I know it could...

439
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,453
that's all over.

440
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:22,055
If you saw me as a threat,
I'd be dead already,

441
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:23,123
so what is this?

442
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,258
Presumably, you want something from me.

443
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,662
You're under his thumb, same way I was.

444
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:31,365
He took everything from
my life that mattered.

445
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,800
He'll do the same to you, trust me.

446
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:36,203
There's only one way out.

447
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:37,504
What is that?

448
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:41,074
You're going to help me kill Eddie Morra.

449
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:46,246
Where are you going?

450
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:47,781
I can't just leave.

451
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,250
Your mom made meat loaf.

452
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,388
Insiders say they have no idea...

453
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,123
At the end of the night,
I was no closer to knowing

454
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,691
if Piper was a disgruntled former operative

455
00:22:57,693 --> 00:23:00,927
or a victim of Morra and Sands.

456
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,362
If she was close to making that enzyme,

457
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,398
she could be another source
for the booster shot.

458
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,700
She could get me free of the senator.

459
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:10,462
__

460
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:13,076
_

461
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:27,854
I'll co-sponsor a new one,

462
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:29,689
give you 40% of whatever you want,

463
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,758
which is better than 100% of nothing. Okay?

464
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,060
Well, give my best to Diane.

465
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:37,197
He's cheating on his wife.

466
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,298
I bring up Diane,

467
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,633
makes him a little more pliable.

468
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,468
Did you kill Piper Baird's boyfriend?

469
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,439
She found you. I thought she might.

470
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:49,276
What does she want?

471
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:51,545
She wants to use you to get to me?

472
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:54,648
Did you kill her boyfriend?

473
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:59,252
The work we do...

474
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:02,155
it's in the shadows, for now.

475
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:04,591
I operate in the dark because I have to.

476
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:08,328
Look, I'll defend what we're
building to my dying breath,

477
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,596
but I wouldn't kill anyone

478
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:11,465
unless they were threatening
to do the same thing to me.

479
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:13,066
Is that an answer?

480
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:16,369
I didn't kill him. She did.

481
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,507
Piper Baird is brilliant,

482
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:22,709
but she is tortured.

483
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:26,613
And she's a liar.

484
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:30,217
After I cut her off,

485
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,419
she broke into one of my R&D facilities

486
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:34,788
and stole a year's supply of the enzyme.

487
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,124
And now she's running
out and she's desperate.

488
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:42,229
You're torn; I understand.

489
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,830
She's very convincing.

490
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:47,033
But she can't help you, Brian.

491
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:50,437
She doesn't know how to make the enzyme.

492
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:54,508
In a way, you're lucky,

493
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,076
because in this situation,

494
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,479
the right choice is the pragmatic choice.

495
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:04,217
And those don't come along every day.

496
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:22,469
Piper's not done with any of us yet.

497
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:26,907
One thing left for you to do.

498
00:25:31,145 --> 00:25:34,014
And use the NZT wisely.

499
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:36,816
Don't you two know me
better than that by now?

500
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:40,120
I'm not going to mean-mug
you on this one, Brian.

501
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,922
You know full well how this works.

502
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:44,224
You're due another shot soon

503
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:46,860
and this needs to happen.

504
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:49,095
Piper came after us.

505
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:53,366
And now you're the
fastest way to get to her.

506
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,737
Listen, son...

507
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:01,608
defend what we're building, Brian.

508
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,877
When you're done,

509
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:05,312
chuck it in the river.

510
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,780
It's untraceable.

511
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,940
Where the hell have you been?

512
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:35,909
Boyle and I have been
trying you all morning.

513
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,144
Yeah, sorry. I had stuff to do.

514
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:40,780
We got an anonymous tip in
the middle of the night.

515
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:42,066
A woman matching the description

516
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:43,550
the security guards gave you

517
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:45,585
was found hiding in an
abandoned building uptown.

518
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,320
SWAT just picked her up.

519
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:48,888
Boyle's questioning her now.

520
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,592
Who's that?

521
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:55,061
Her name is Brandy Jo Hawkins.

522
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:58,498
She just confessed to
shooting Senator Morra.

523
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:07,414
That woman? Brandy Jo Hawkins?

524
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,383
She obviously didn't shoot Senator Morra,

525
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:11,151
but she makes a great suspect.

526
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:13,954
She was one of the first
female snipers in the military.

527
00:27:13,956 --> 00:27:16,090
She had four confirmed kills in Iraq,

528
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,424
then got kicked out of the military

529
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:18,892
for hitting a superior officer.

530
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:21,061
She was an easy target to be radicalized

531
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:22,429
by a grass-roots militia.

532
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:26,000
The way she told it,
Brandy had means and motive.

533
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:27,835
She knew details.

534
00:27:27,837 --> 00:27:30,304
She said a meth dealer
gave her an NZT pill.

535
00:27:30,306 --> 00:27:33,273
Senator Morra wants the FBI
to stop looking for Piper.

536
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:34,775
Best way to do that?

537
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:37,277
Give them a different shooter.

538
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,481
God knows how he got that
poor woman to take the fall.

539
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:48,022
Okay, so Morra and Sands have their patsy.

540
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:50,357
That leaves one thing on their to-do list.

541
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,725
Piper.

542
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:53,060
They want me to kill her.

543
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:54,395
She wants me to kill them.

544
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:56,363
Who do I side with?

545
00:27:56,365 --> 00:27:57,998
Why should you side with anyone?

546
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,167
I mean, who says you have to commit murder?

547
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:01,702
They do.

548
00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:03,370
They didn't give me an
option of not killing anyone.

549
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:04,838
Exactly.

550
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,073
That's why there's not
even a question here.

551
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:08,542
You dance with the one that brung ya.

552
00:28:08,544 --> 00:28:09,943
And that is Eddie.

553
00:28:09,945 --> 00:28:11,879
Piper says she'll create the enzyme soon.

554
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,247
She says she didn't kill her boyfriend.

555
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,314
But you don't know.

556
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:16,483
The only thing you do know

557
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:18,619
is that Eddie Morra can help you.

558
00:28:18,621 --> 00:28:20,020
That's for certain.

559
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:21,755
I'm pretty sure about one thing.

560
00:28:21,757 --> 00:28:23,924
You're not a killer.

561
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:25,559
No one's a killer.

562
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:28,695
Not until they kill, that is.

563
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:30,464
What are those things you're wearing?

564
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:33,934
All right, obviously I'm
having a hard time with this.

565
00:28:33,936 --> 00:28:35,903
That's why you all are showing up.

566
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:38,672
So if I could just have
a little peace and quiet,

567
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:40,374
- I think that I...
- Excuse me?

568
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:43,544
I'm not sure what I'm doing here,

569
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:45,145
but these things really make me itchy.

570
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:46,346
Join Team Badass, Ike.

571
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:48,348
You get cool leather jackets.

572
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,350
Leather sticks to my skin.

573
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:51,618
All right, enough!

574
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:56,690
Oh, you're making
this too hard, kid.

575
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:59,226
There's no way out of this.

576
00:28:59,228 --> 00:29:00,694
I mean, one way or another,

577
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:03,430
I'm gonna be forced to do
something that I can't.

578
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:06,166
And if I don't, I'll die.

579
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:08,702
And it'll blow back on you guys.

580
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:11,472
- Who do you believe?
- What?

581
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:13,774
That's the first thing you're
gonna have to decide.

582
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:18,112
Is Senator Morra a cold-blooded murderer,

583
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:21,982
or did Piper Baird kill her boyfriend?

584
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:23,217
You're never gonna know,

585
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,052
so you have to go with what you feel.

586
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:28,755
Decide who you believe.

587
00:29:28,757 --> 00:29:30,591
Side with them.

588
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:33,260
And then you can really start thinking.

589
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,240
Brandy Jo Hawkins said

590
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,109
she got NZT from a meth dealer.

591
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:51,078
When's the last time
someone below wholesale

592
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,279
had a pill to sell?

593
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,449
Maybe 18 months? Why?

594
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:58,051
Something's wrong with her story.

595
00:29:58,053 --> 00:29:59,453
Her blood test confirmed

596
00:29:59,455 --> 00:30:01,121
that she had NZT in her system,

597
00:30:01,123 --> 00:30:02,189
but I ran a full battery

598
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:03,390
and something else came back, too.

599
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:05,826
She has Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

600
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:07,027
It's fatal.

601
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:09,596
It plays havoc with your coordination.

602
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:12,633
Yet she managed to get
herself into position,

603
00:30:12,635 --> 00:30:14,201
take an impossible shot,

604
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:15,869
and avoid every surveillance camera.

605
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:17,638
So something's not sitting
right with you, either?

606
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,072
Yeah, well...

607
00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:22,242
It's... she was so smart along the way.

608
00:30:22,244 --> 00:30:24,778
Then, all of a sudden, bam!

609
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,879
An anonymous tip, she's sitting

610
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:27,614
right in our lap, telling us everything.

611
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,116
It just seems too easy.

612
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,752
And you know what else?

613
00:30:31,754 --> 00:30:34,288
Her parents' house

614
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,224
was in foreclosure up until two days ago,

615
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:38,759
right before we picked her up.

616
00:30:38,761 --> 00:30:41,528
The bank settled, supposedly
an accounting error.

617
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,297
Now it's theirs, free and clear.

618
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,266
Well, what if someone settled
the debt against her house

619
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:48,335
and in return, she confessed to a crime

620
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:49,937
she didn't commit?

621
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:52,506
Because of her disease, she'll
be dead within the year.

622
00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:54,474
This way, she gets to leave something

623
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:56,043
for her family.

624
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:57,844
If she's taking a fall...

625
00:30:57,846 --> 00:30:59,146
who's it for?

626
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:03,217
And why would someone on NZT
be targeting Senator Morra?

627
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:26,940
So, you believe me?

628
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:30,344
Yeah, I believe you.

629
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,646
I don't know if I trust you.

630
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:35,849
I came unarmed, just like you asked.

631
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:40,153
You know Morra says you're psychotic?

632
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:43,423
And yet, here we are.

633
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:45,492
Yeah.

634
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:47,494
You know what I think?

635
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:50,130
I think you know what needs to happen.

636
00:31:50,132 --> 00:31:51,465
And I think you know
you're the one to do it.

637
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:54,534
You just need a little help getting there.

638
00:31:56,971 --> 00:31:59,273
He'll take everything that
means anything to you, Brian.

639
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:00,841
He'll do it and he'll say

640
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:03,877
it had to happen to make a better world.

641
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,249
Would you take your hands off me, please?

642
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,684
What is that?

643
00:32:10,686 --> 00:32:11,718
You set me up?

644
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,220
I'm sorry. It was you or me.

645
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:02,469
Wait, no.

646
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:06,073
No!

647
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,589
We got hold of all
the security cam footage.

648
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:28,592
No one saw your face.

649
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:30,460
And...

650
00:33:30,462 --> 00:33:32,162
we had one of our people from the NYPD

651
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:35,532
pull that gun with your
prints off the scene.

652
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:39,302
And there's no trace of you being there.

653
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:42,039
For a botched plan,

654
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:44,207
it went quite well.

655
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:49,112
Drink that.

656
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:52,749
I killed her.

657
00:33:52,751 --> 00:33:55,952
We got a DNA sample.

658
00:33:55,954 --> 00:33:58,522
It was Piper Baird on those tracks.

659
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:01,991
What, you didn't think we'd
double-check your work?

660
00:34:04,595 --> 00:34:06,063
Believe it or not, I know exactly

661
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:09,900
what you're feeling right now.

662
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:13,036
Do you know what I did after my first?

663
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:15,939
I rang my year four teacher.

664
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:19,810
Cried like I was one of the Sabine women.

665
00:34:20,712 --> 00:34:23,013
Why her, I don't know.

666
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:28,151
Practically confessed.

667
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,721
I'm lucky she didn't turn me in.

668
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:35,092
How do you live with it...?

669
00:34:35,094 --> 00:34:36,993
All things pass, Brian.

670
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:39,162
The volume of your feelings right now?

671
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:40,597
They'll go down.

672
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:43,467
This is hard.

673
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,035
But it's like a baptism.

674
00:34:45,037 --> 00:34:47,738
You're an initiate now.

675
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,073
You're a part of the real world.

676
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:53,977
The strong eat the weak.

677
00:34:58,483 --> 00:35:00,684
Same as it ever was.

678
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:11,895
All right, okay.

679
00:35:11,897 --> 00:35:13,797
You picked the wrong day to come in late.

680
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:16,199
Senator Morra came by to
thank us all personally.

681
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,368
Oh, too bad I missed it.

682
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,678
Goatwhore?

683
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,081
Yeah.

684
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,816
I liked them in high school.

685
00:35:32,818 --> 00:35:34,384
It freaks the people around here out,

686
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:37,187
so leave it up.

687
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:38,955
I have a question for you.

688
00:35:38,957 --> 00:35:40,657
You don't have to answer right now.

689
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:42,626
But if you spend some time with it,

690
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:44,628
I think it might help you.

691
00:35:54,038 --> 00:35:56,039
Why are you trying so hard to hold on

692
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,141
to the person you were before NZT?

693
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,677
That's who I am.

694
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,314
Well, it doesn't have to be.

695
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:07,784
I remember Eddie Morra.

696
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:09,553
He was a terrible writer.

697
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:12,255
And he lacked the
self-discipline and awareness

698
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,924
to do anything about it.

699
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:17,360
I couldn't wait to get rid of
him and become somebody else.

700
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:19,629
But you?

701
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:24,501
We're different from other people, Brian.

702
00:36:24,503 --> 00:36:28,205
We become more different
with every pill we take.

703
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:32,142
You don't have to run from that.

704
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:33,677
You can embrace it.

705
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,512
I don't want to be someone else.

706
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:37,948
I think you do.

707
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,483
You're just not willing to admit it yet.

708
00:36:46,657 --> 00:36:49,593
You're on NZT.

709
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:52,562
You're above the kind of concerns

710
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:55,465
that you're letting weigh you down.

711
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:58,835
Put them down, walk away.

712
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:01,304
You'll feel so much lighter.

713
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:05,175
I promise.

714
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:11,648
No, I wasn't followed.

715
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,383
I went exactly the way you told me to...

716
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:16,119
Three cabs, two subways,
avoided every camera

717
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:17,554
from Federal Plaza to here.

718
00:37:17,556 --> 00:37:19,389
Not easy to do, by the way,

719
00:37:19,391 --> 00:37:21,191
in the most photographed city in the world.

720
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:25,095
Really not easy to do without NZT.

721
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:26,696
I know what you're thinking...

722
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:28,064
"She's alive!"

723
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,233
Also, hopefully, "I thought
for sure he'd killed her."

724
00:37:30,235 --> 00:37:31,701
Because let's be honest...

725
00:37:31,703 --> 00:37:33,937
You're not the person
we're trying to fool here.

726
00:37:37,675 --> 00:37:39,342
I'm not killing Eddie.

727
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:40,710
I'm not killing anybody.

728
00:37:40,712 --> 00:37:42,178
And if you want to keep up
this war between you guys,

729
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,413
then that's on you.

730
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:45,482
But in the meantime, I've got an idea.

731
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:47,117
Luckily I know a lot

732
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,551
about jumping in front of subway trains,

733
00:37:48,553 --> 00:37:50,420
and she, disturbingly, knows a thing or two

734
00:37:50,422 --> 00:37:52,355
about stealing cadavers and rigging them

735
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,823
under subway platforms.

736
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:55,225
There was just one more thing.

737
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:57,761
We were fairly certain
Sands would check the DNA

738
00:37:57,763 --> 00:38:01,598
of the body found at the scene
to be sure it matched Piper.

739
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,401
Since we couldn't put
Piper's DNA into a dead body,

740
00:38:04,403 --> 00:38:06,503
I suggested we do it the
other way around...

741
00:38:06,505 --> 00:38:10,774
Turn the body into Piper,
at least in the system.

742
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:21,117
I also knew Sands
would be watching the whole time,

743
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,087
so we'd have to make it look perfect.

744
00:38:27,024 --> 00:38:28,858
You should come away with me.

745
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,160
I have a lab set up.

746
00:38:30,162 --> 00:38:32,829
I'm gonna figure out how
that enzyme works, Brian.

747
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:36,433
You can be free of Morra for good.

748
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:38,902
The people I love aren't gone yet.

749
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:40,070
They're here.

750
00:38:40,072 --> 00:38:42,305
If I leave,

751
00:38:42,307 --> 00:38:45,575
I-I might as well kill them myself.

752
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:49,913
Can I give you some advice?

753
00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:53,049
Just drop this war with Morra.

754
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:56,086
Figure out how to make that shot,

755
00:38:56,088 --> 00:38:57,787
and live your life.

756
00:38:57,789 --> 00:38:59,923
You don't get it yet.

757
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:02,158
If someone doesn't stop Morra,

758
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,762
no one's gonna be able to
just "live their life."

759
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:07,497
The whole world's gonna be

760
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:10,133
very different, Brian.

761
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:13,703
You can't play both sides forever.

762
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:21,211
You have to leave the country now.

763
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:23,346
Like we agreed.

764
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,284
If Morra ever finds out
that you are still alive,

765
00:39:28,286 --> 00:39:31,788
then everything that means
anything to me is gone.

766
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:41,231
You have a nice family.

767
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,636
I hope I get to see you again,
under better circumstances.

768
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:44,813
