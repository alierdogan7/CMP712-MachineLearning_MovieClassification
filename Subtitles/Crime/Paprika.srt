1
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,650
It's the greatest show time!

2
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,050
There's no doubt.

3
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,760
- He's here.
- Who?

4
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,810
Be careful. He's a traitor.

5
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,930
There's someone who keeps
looking at you. See?

6
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,480
It's okay, he's a friend.

7
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,740
Please turn your attention
to this gentleman!

8
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,070
Now, one, two, three!

9
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,920
There he is! Get him!

10
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,600
Grab my hand!

11
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,610
I let him get away again!

12
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,110
Aren't you the one who got away?

13
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,040
One more time!

14
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000
Take that!

15
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,460
But what about the rest of it?

16
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,530
You were in my dream.

17
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,240
Everyone is startled at first.

18
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,030
The DC Mini.

19
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,250
It's the scientific key that allows us
to open the door to our dreams.

20
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,750
It can even do all this?

21
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,300
It really is a dream machine.

22
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,260
To tell you the truth,
the DC Mini is still incomplete.

23
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,760
Once complete, we'll be able to enter
your dream even while awake.

24
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,480
You said he was a friend.

25
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,110
We used to work together.

26
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,030
Why did he put you in a cage?

27
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,860
I don't know.

28
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,450
He's not the kind of person
who would trick me.

29
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,750
Why are they all me?

30
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,500
That was really disturbing.

31
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,920
This is Tarzan, right?

32
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,920
This is a scene from
a spy movie, perhaps?

33
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,760
The fighting was rather fun.

34
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,470
REM sleep that occurs later during the sleep cycle...

35
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,310
...is longer and easier to analyze.

36
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,890
If earlier cycles are, say,
artsy film shorts...

37
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,150
...later cycles are like feature-length
blockbuster movies.

38
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,900
Then that makes you
a dream movie star.

39
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,870
Do you not like movies?

40
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,030
It's not that.

41
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,750
What is this?

42
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,710
The victim in the homicide case
I'm working on right now.

43
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,970
I haven't been able to catch the perp,
so maybe that's why I...

44
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,430
- Your anxiety neurosis.
- Do you think this is the source?

45
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,680
No need to rush.

46
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,600
The treatment's just getting started.

47
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,230
Take care, Captain Konakawa.

48
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,530
When can I see you again?

49
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,040
I'm in a bind.

50
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,130
- I can see that.
- No, it's not that.

51
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,510
I was on my way to see you.

52
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,140
It's not that! The DC Mini!

53
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,560
It was stolen? The DC Mini?

54
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,190
We found out this morning.

55
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,070
Three samples in Dr. Tokita's
possession were stolen.

56
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,860
But why?

57
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,790
We'll worry about the reason later.
We need to find them now.

58
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,540
Do you think it's internal?

59
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,880
Unfortunately.

60
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,750
We'll talk about that later.

61
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,170
Foundation for
Psychiatric Research

62
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,880
Meet me in my office.
We'll figure out a plan...

63
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,260
...before the chairman finds out.

64
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,140
Yes, we have to protect
the DC Mini.

65
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,730
It's too bad it was stolen, but all
we have to do is make another one.

66
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,610
You should know better than anyone
what can happen if it's misused.

67
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,990
You invented it.

68
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,740
I make it, but how it's used
is your job, At-chan.

69
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,500
Don't call me At-chan.

70
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,260
There is one more problem.

71
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,090
Good grief.

72
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,890
I hadn't programmed the access
controls into the DC Mini yet.

73
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,020
Translate that for me.

74
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,150
It means that the person
who stole the DC Mini...

75
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,320
...can connect to a psychotherapy
machine at any time, from any place...

76
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,110
...and use it to intrude into the minds
connected to that machine.

77
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,950
Chief's Office

78
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,740
I see. We have to hurry.

79
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,550
It is man's responsibility
to control science and technology.

80
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,180
Chairman.

81
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,930
Sharing in another's dream.

82
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,270
It is quite literally
a technological dream...

83
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,690
...but, in time,
it can lead to violence.

84
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,440
It was an invention that never should have been created.

85
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,820
This discussion again?

86
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,450
The DC Mini represents the hope...

87
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,580
...that shines on the new horizons
of psychiatric treatment.

88
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,460
It is taking control over dreams.

89
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,040
Your overconfidence
will bring weakness.

90
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,290
It is not about control.

91
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,590
We are simply pursuing
a deeper connection with our patients.

92
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,970
The terrorist who stole it
won't see it that way.

93
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,230
But it hasn't even been misused yet.

94
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,900
Thieves are not always wrong.

95
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,320
Paprika.

96
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,700
I hear there's a woman...

97
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,570
...who's been using the psychotherapy
machine for unapproved treatments.

98
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,830
Are you going to believe
such groundless rumors, chairman?

99
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,920
Discipline calls for a search of the
DC Mini rather than Paprika's bikini.

100
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,590
This is true happiness.

101
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,590
Discipline?

102
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:52,010
Even the five court ladies danced
in sync to the frog's flutes and drums.

103
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,100
The whirlwind of recycled paper
was a sight to see.

104
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,560
It was like computer graphics!

105
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,310
That I don't support Technicolor
parfaits and snobby petit bourgeois...

106
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,860
...is common knowledge in Oceania!

107
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,110
Now is the time to return home
to the blue sky!

108
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,700
The confetti will dance around
the shrine gates.

109
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,040
The mailbox and the refrigerator
will lead the way!

110
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,880
Anyone who cares
about expiration dates...

111
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,880
...will not get in the way
of the glory train!

112
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,590
They need to fully realize
the liver of the triangle rulers!

113
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,930
Now, this festival was decided
by the third-grade class...

114
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,770
...with the telephoto camera!

115
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,270
Move forward! Come together!
I am the ultimate...

116
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,730
...governor!

117
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,770
Chief!

118
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,400
Now! Right now!

119
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,130
Take me in!

120
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,070
He has the dream of a patient
planted in his brain.

121
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,120
How's the chief doing?

122
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,620
His breathing and pulse are stable.

123
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,880
I guess it could've been worse.

124
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,300
Dr. Chiba, here are
the chief's medical records.

125
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,670
Thank you.

126
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,760
He was probably using the
therapy machine to treat a patient-

127
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,800
When someone used
a DC Mini to intrude.

128
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,640
And the dream was projected
into his subconscious...

129
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,980
...without him knowing.

130
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,900
But for that to happen...

131
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,650
The culprit has to be watching
this nightmare too.

132
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,780
What a desperate terrorist.

133
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,160
All terrorists are desperate.

134
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,740
The sun during midday
will light up the dark night.

135
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:28,750
Night dreams of day.
Light dreams of darkness.

136
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,710
But the ignorant sun...

137
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,460
...will chase away the darkness
and burn the shadows...

138
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,970
...eventually burning itself!

139
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,470
Himuro!

140
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,470
The shade of the tree
with the flowers that bloom at night...

141
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,940
...is where the residents
of darkness rest.

142
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,480
Why is Himuro in there?

143
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,770
The people of daytime
are not allowed!

144
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,110
Where is Himuro?

145
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,280
He's been out for the past few days,
but I didn't think too much of it.

146
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,500
Himuro tends to abandon
everything else...

147
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,790
...when he really gets
into something.

148
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,380
Like doctor, like assistant.

149
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,300
How could we not have seen this coming?

150
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,140
I thought he was my friend.

151
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,310
A genius produces a lot more
than he realizes.

152
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,980
More clearly, please.

153
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,400
Himuro was jealous of Dr. Tokita.

154
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,490
Even I feel bitter towards you
sometimes, Dr. Chiba.

155
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,990
No matter how hard I try,
I'm not as good as you.

156
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,160
I feel powerless.

157
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,510
It's open.

158
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,310
- You mean you opened it.
- This is illegal, you know.

159
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,680
I'm not as bad as Himuro, though.

160
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,610
- Welcome home.
- Welcome back.

161
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,800
He can't be serious.

162
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,450
- This is dangerous.
- This isn't your cue.

163
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,990
Anaphylaxis?

164
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,290
Like an allergy?

165
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,510
I can't think of any other reason.

166
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,760
I got stung by a jellyfish
when I was a kid...

167
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,850
...and even now, I have
allergic reactions at the sight of one.

168
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,310
It didn't occur to me until now.

169
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Here you go.
Who had the udon set?

170
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,610
But the DC Mini uses
a transmission formula...

171
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,030
...within the natural width
of the body's energy level.

172
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,450
Who had the jumbo steak set?

173
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,960
Depending on the frequency of use,
the body might adapt to it.

174
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,080
And as a result, Dr. Chiba,
who has had the most exposure...

175
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,090
...was more susceptible
to invasion...

176
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,550
...even when she wasn't connected
to the DC Mini, nor was she asleep.

177
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,390
Who had the paella?

178
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,060
I think you have a problem too.
Like overeating.

179
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,060
I can't fight on an empty stomach.

180
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,070
Fight?

181
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,070
Implanting dreams into
other people's heads is terrorism.

182
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,500
At-chan, you said
that Himuro and I were alike.

183
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,250
I think so too. All the more reason
this is unforgivable.

184
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,550
Hello?

185
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,810
We'll be there immediately.

186
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,320
Chief! Please, come back!

187
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,330
Wake up! Chief!

188
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,910
The delicious left brain
is getting older...

189
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,920
...and drifting to a faraway island.

190
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,090
Himuro, give him back!

191
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,390
I, who stand before you,
am the protector of your dreams.

192
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,810
I wonder what kind of punishment
will befall the ignorant commoner...

193
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,270
...who tries to enter
this sacred dream?

194
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:17,160
You're the feisty country girl
I saved some time ago.

195
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,120
How are you?

196
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,250
If he was not home
when I passed by around 7:30...

197
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,630
...then he probably disappeared
into the instant noodle soup.

198
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,960
Thank you for saving me.

199
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,090
I have come to show you
my appreciation.

200
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,430
Is it a square?

201
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,970
No.

202
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,730
It's round, like this.

203
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,480
I can feel it.

204
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,410
- Paprika.
- Do you remember me now?

205
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,910
I'm going to be a little rough.

206
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,580
Paprika, what are you doing?

207
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,420
Now, now, stop that.

208
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,720
Welcome back, Chief.

209
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,610
I wonder where
that parade was going?

210
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,110
A place of no return, most likely.

211
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,700
I felt like I was really close...

212
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,620
...to controlling the entire world.

213
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,830
That was a dream
of a severely delusional patient.

214
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,960
While you were in there, your
brain waves and body deteriorated...

215
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,750
...almost to the point of death.

216
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,510
That's why Paprika came.
Thank you.

217
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,800
You haven't changed...

218
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,310
...since the time you treated
my depression two years ago.

219
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,560
I'll let Paprika know.

220
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,980
But to think that that honest Himuro
was responsible.

221
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,570
What should I do now, Dr. Chiba?

222
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,530
- Please don't do anything.
- What?

223
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,620
The chairman will probably halt
the development of the DC Mini...

224
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,290
...as a result of this incident.

225
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,590
But with you, a board member,
in the hospital...

226
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,010
They can't have a meeting.

227
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,930
Hello? Oh, Konokawa.

228
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,480
How was the...? You know.

229
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,980
I would have asked sooner if I had
known that it would be this good.

230
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,070
Remember, you can't tell anyone.

231
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,450
I want to keep it a secret
all to myself.

232
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,700
Paprika's existence
cannot become public...

233
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,540
...until the psychotherapy machines
gain public approval.

234
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,790
She really is
a woman of your dreams.

235
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,800
Women of dreams
are busy these days.

236
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,340
You look tired.
Want me to look in on your dreams?

237
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,310
I haven't been seeing
any of my own lately.

238
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,170
Welcome. We were waiting for you.

239
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,520
Good evening.

240
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,150
What is this place?

241
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,490
A counseling room. A meeting place.
A date spot.

242
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,830
Don't you think dreams
and the Internet are similar?

243
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,000
They are both areas where
the repressed conscious mind vents.

244
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,670
Here you go.

245
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,260
Have you found anything?

246
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,060
In regards to my dreams?

247
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,020
You're so impatient.

248
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,490
Do you work
at the research foundation?

249
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,990
It was Shima who introduced me, after all.

250
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,610
Where do you know
Mr. Shima from?

251
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,120
He's a friend from college.

252
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,620
We got along pretty well,
so we always hung out.

253
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,880
Drinking and watching movies?

254
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,800
No, movies don't interest me.

255
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,840
I love them!

256
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,890
Paprika?

257
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,260
Put it on my tab.

258
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,220
Hey, Paprika!

259
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,620
Which one do you want to see?

260
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,370
I'm sorry,
but movies really aren't my thing.

261
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,710
Come on, hurry!

262
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,250
I don't like movies!

263
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,970
Hey, Tsumura, stop-

264
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,470
Breaking news!

265
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,270
The widow who tells fortunes
in the shade of roof tiles!

266
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,690
The response is sunny!

267
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,270
The sign of good fortune!

268
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,440
The ceiling fan brings a message
releasing epithets!

269
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,030
The maiden who sleeps under
the veranda has a pulse!

270
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,280
This is the way out!

271
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,450
The secret of this view is deep
within the 10-year loan payment!

272
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,040
They are new victims.

273
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,170
I am stopping development.

274
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,840
But the board meeting-

275
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,800
The culprit won't wait
for a board meeting to happen.

276
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,800
I am forbidding all use of DC Mini
and the psychotherapy machines.

277
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,470
This is retribution.

278
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,900
Science is nothing...

279
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,230
...but a piece of trash
before a profound dream.

280
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,000
Are you okay?

281
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,330
I heard the parts are non-recyclable.

282
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,250
But that's an important piece
of equipment.

283
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,260
I'll just have to make it again.

284
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,260
He's a genius.

285
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,350
He's a mysterious one, all right.

286
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,150
You're giving him too much credit.

287
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,480
He's just a kid inside.

288
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,870
DREAMLAND

289
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,830
It was a small theme park,
but I liked it as a kid.

290
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,250
I used to talk about it with Himuro.

291
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,030
Do you really think Himuro is here?

292
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,070
If I knew, I wouldn't be searching.

293
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,780
You're so cold, At-chan.

294
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,080
You should act more like Paprika.

295
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,410
I know, I know.

296
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,670
I have a feeling he's near.

297
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,500
Keep quiet, both of you.

298
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,830
Watch out!

299
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,550
Himuro?

300
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,640
- That's-
- A DC Mini.

301
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,530
The high pressure holds the grab bag
and looks a lot like milk.

302
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,620
The dense forest turns into
a shopping district.

303
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,000
The 24-bit eggplant will be analyzed.

304
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,750
So you're saying both of them were
attacked by way of the DC Mini...

305
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,800
...which broke their psyches.

306
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,840
And the culprit, Kei Himuro, was
also disturbed by the nightmare...

307
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,220
...and tried to commit suicide.
Is that right?

308
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,390
It's not because of the DC Mini!

309
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,980
It's just a little incomplete.
Himuro knew that.

310
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,900
I'm not refuting your invention.

311
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,830
She's the head of
the DC Mini development team.

312
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,080
I'm Chiba.

313
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,960
This is Mr. Konakawa
from the police department.

314
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,090
Yes?

315
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,100
Isn't it wonderful?

316
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,560
The ability to see a friend's dream
as if it were your own.

317
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,020
To share the same dream.

318
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,030
Yes, it probably would be
a wonderful experience.

319
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,150
You understand, right?

320
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,410
It came to me during
a brain scan I was doing...

321
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,790
...using a computer image processor.

322
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:31,790
And you can use it to treat illness.

323
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,090
That's exactly right!

324
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,550
The nonlinear waves created by
surges in the bioelectrical current...

325
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,430
...can be applied to create
new synapse connections...

326
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,470
...by adjusting the BTU output.

327
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:52,900
To use a person's body for energy
is a remarkable idea.

328
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,270
Exactly! And the reason
why I focused...

329
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,150
You are talking
with Dr. Tokita, right?

330
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,910
That's her, isn't it?

331
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,620
Paprika.

332
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:15,590
So what do you think
about this case?

333
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,670
Well, I think it's an accident.

334
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,930
It's hard to build a case
against a dream.

335
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,930
"Isn't it wonderful," eh?

336
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,430
The bulky one.

337
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,730
To think such a silly thought
would lead to such an invention.

338
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,190
He's a kid trapped inside
the body of a genius.

339
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,120
It's an adult's responsibility to steer
that genius in the right direction.

340
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,910
Chairman.

341
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,540
There is always conceit
and negligence behind misconduct.

342
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,590
You have it hard too, I guess.

343
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,000
Good grief.

344
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,890
Where did I go wrong
to end up here?

345
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,720
I want to go back
to our college days...

346
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,930
...back to when we used to
talk about our futures.

347
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,990
I want to go back
to our college days...

348
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,200
...back to when we used to
talk about our futures.

349
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,520
But what about the rest of it?

350
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,650
It's too dangerous!

351
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,370
Himuro went in
and he's not coming back.

352
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,040
If the same happens to you...

353
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,500
There are still two DC Minis
out there.

354
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:23,550
Our only lead is inside Himuro.
And besides...

355
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,800
The chairman has already prohibited
the use of the therapy machines.

356
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,930
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

357
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,770
Don't worry.
The genius boy is here for backup.

358
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,100
Dr. Tokita again?

359
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,360
I know that you two
established this field...

360
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,370
...so that's all the more reason for you
to place your trust in him...

361
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,620
...but his immaturity is the cause
of all these mishaps!

362
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,540
That's why we'll make him
take responsibility.

363
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,380
Besides, is there anyone else?

364
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,980
This isn't the time for that.

365
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,650
There are people in the world
that understand.

366
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,660
That cop.
He has a mind for science.

367
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,870
He doesn't seem
very smart, though.

368
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,040
Now all I have to do is set the filtering
program for external access and-

369
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,040
What was that for?

370
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,680
Do you really think it was Himuro?

371
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:59,180
He's your assistant, and he knew
the risks involved with the DC Mini.

372
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,020
He knew what would happen
if he exposed himself for too long.

373
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,190
What did he have to gain from it all?

374
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,740
He was jealous of me.
Even Osanai says so.

375
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,780
He might be a victim too.

376
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,830
That's like a line
from a mystery novel.

377
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,710
If so, then it's still dangerous.
We need to confirm-

378
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,500
No more talk.

379
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,050
What I need to do is finish this.

380
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,890
You guys are really alike.

381
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,470
At-chan?

382
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,430
You and Himuro.

383
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
You get preoccupied
with what you want to do...

384
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,900
...and ignore what you have to do.

385
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,490
Don't you understand
that your irresponsibility cost lives?

386
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:55,030
Of course not.
Nothing can get through all that fat.

387
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,740
And now what? "Isn't it wonderful"?
"A mind for science"?

388
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,290
Don't make me laugh.

389
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,080
How can a mad scientist
know what a human mind is?

390
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,210
If you want to be king of geeks
with your bloated ego...

391
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,760
...then just keep up all this and
indulge in your freakish masturbation!

392
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,160
And where is Mr. Konakawa now?

393
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,460
At a hotel. It's all here.

394
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,130
I'm counting on you.

395
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,730
There's no doubt. He's here.

396
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,020
You've crossed the line of action.

397
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,110
Be careful. He's a traitor.

398
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,030
You need to narrow the exposure.
This is Panfocus.

399
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,170
Now, one, two, three!

400
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,340
There he is! Get him!

401
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,010
Welcome.

402
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,690
What floor?

403
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,190
The guy, I'm after him.

404
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,030
Of course. The 14th floor.

405
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,370
Fourteenth floor,
the adventure section.

406
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,590
Fifteenth floor,
the suspense section.

407
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,390
Sixteenth floor,
the romance section.

408
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,890
One more time!

409
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,690
Seventeenth floor,
the special section.

410
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,140
No!

411
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,900
I don't need to go there.

412
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,190
Encore!

413
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,650
I killed myself?

414
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,240
That's like a line
from a mystery novel.

415
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,040
It was a rush job,
but I put an access function on it.

416
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,340
Morals, responsibilities...

417
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,090
I don't really get that adults' stuff.

418
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,720
But let's talk it over again.

419
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,720
We're friends, right?

420
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,370
Oh, jeez.

421
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,290
Was making them not enough?
You had to become a doll yourself?

422
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,380
Why did you steal it?

423
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,380
Do you hate me that much?

424
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,300
Or was it not you who did it?

425
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,640
Even with an access function...

426
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,810
...it's not one person's
dream anymore.

427
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,980
That's right!
The DC Mini was both our dreams!

428
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,440
The crossing of two dreams
creates many more dreams.

429
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:24,110
That's right! The entire development
team dreamt of its completion.

430
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,200
This is a foolish place to be...

431
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,820
...to inquire about
the master of this dream.

432
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,240
The conceit of the daytime residents
is what the nighttime residents want.

433
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:39,290
To come in carelessly
is like a moth to a flame.

434
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,130
You're not Himuro, are you?

435
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,220
What's the line of action
that clown was talking about?

436
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,970
It's an imaginary line...

437
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,600
...that connects the subjects
on camera.

438
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,520
If the camera crosses that line...

439
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:04,280
...the cut is awkward.

440
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,280
That's why it has to be like this.

441
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,700
I see. How about Panfocus?

442
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:13,450
It's a camera technique...

443
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:18,250
...where you narrow the angle
to get the entire screen in focus.

444
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,840
So you did like them.

445
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:22,840
Movies.

446
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:27,300
Are your dreams
in Panfocus now too?

447
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,680
Have you solved the mystery
of why you killed yourself?

448
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,430
I've never thought of suicide.

449
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,100
Maybe it's someone a lot like you.

450
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,020
Like me?

451
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,570
Or another you.

452
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,120
Another me?

453
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,710
Paprika, is the inside of my head
this messed up?

454
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,050
The dreams are merging.

455
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,430
Tokita.

456
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,510
He got started without me!

457
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,390
- Wait! Tokita!
- Paprika!

458
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,980
Why are you here?

459
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:27,570
The ecstasy that blooms in synapse
is Paprika-brand milk fat!

460
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,400
Five percent is the norm.

461
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,240
Tokita! No!

462
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,580
The safety net of the ocean...

463
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,210
...is nonlinear,
even with what crabs dream of!

464
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,460
Let's go!

465
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:50,670
Wake up!

466
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,100
So you're saying...

467
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:06,650
...the dreams of Tokita and Himuro
merged into Konakawa's dream?

468
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,400
The anaphylaxis of the DC Mini
is expanding exponentially!

469
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,990
Just meet me at the lab.

470
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,540
They're not dreaming?

471
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,250
But they're in REM sleep.

472
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:35,800
It's as if their consciousness
itself has been taken away.

473
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,310
I guess this calls for Paprika.

474
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:52,610
I'll dive into Himuro's dream.
That's the only way to save Tokita.

475
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,590
Chief, can you hear me?

476
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,140
Yeah, I hear you loud and clear.

477
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,435
Any abnormalities?

478
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,040
This dream is very dangerous.

479
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:27,350
If anything happens to Atsuko,
use the awakening apparatus.

480
00:47:27,385 --> 00:47:30,690
Of course. But is it really safe?

481
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,780
Tokita is gone because
he went into Himuro's dream.

482
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,880
Who do you think I am?

483
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:45,580
- I'm sorry to have doubted you.
- There they are!

484
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,310
Himuro isn't there.

485
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,680
But it's his dream.

486
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,940
Osanai?

487
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,580
- Be careful.
- Leave it to me.

488
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,540
Himuro.

489
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,690
Wake her up!

490
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:40,770
Chief! Hurry!

491
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,380
That's not
Himuro's dream anymore.

492
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:10,350
So he was a victim too.

493
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,060
He's an empty shell.

494
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:18,520
He was invaded
by a collective dream.

495
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,520
A collective dream?

496
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,360
With no access restrictions...

497
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:28,030
...the DC Mini can be used to invade
any psychotherapy machine.

498
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,200
Every dream it came in contact with
was eaten up...

499
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:36,910
...into one huge delusion.

500
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:41,250
And that delusion belongs to...

501
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:55,600
This breath seethes
in the joy of life.

502
00:52:56,350 --> 00:53:00,100
I will not allow
arrogant scientific technology...

503
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:04,900
...to intrude in this holy ground.

504
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,950
Return Dr. Tokita to us.

505
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,660
The dreams are horrified...

506
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:19,660
...that their safe refuge is
destroyed by technology.

507
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,670
Are you going to punish him
like you did Himuro?

508
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:29,510
In a world of inhumane reality...

509
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:34,300
...it is the only
humane sanctuary left.

510
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:36,310
That is a dream.

511
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,980
That parade is full of refugees...

512
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,310
...who were unwillingly
chased out of reality.

513
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,480
You are collecting those
with stolen technology.

514
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,980
Do you plan to take over
the world of dreams?

515
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,150
I am protecting them.

516
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,200
I am the guardian of dreams.

517
00:53:55,450 --> 00:54:00,120
My duty is to mete out justice
to terrorists like you, Paprika.

518
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,840
Don't make me get rough with you.

519
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,340
This is a dream too, huh?

520
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,890
Paprika, wake up! Paprika!

521
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,100
Wake up, Chiba!

522
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,150
Chiba! Paprika!

523
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,710
The sphinx look doesn't suit you.

524
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,470
An intelligent researcher by day...

525
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,220
...the chairman's humble servant
by night, is that it?

526
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,520
Shut up! I have many faces.
That makes me human!

527
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:09,070
Oedipus is the perfect look for a man
completely controlled by the chairman!

528
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,190
Shut up!

529
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,420
That's right, keep running.

530
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,380
There are no boundaries to dreams.

531
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,510
The spirit will be freed
from the constraints of the body...

532
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,760
...and gain limitless freedom.

533
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:35,930
Including me!

534
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,850
I will also be free!

535
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,740
The dream continues from here.

536
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,420
No! Paprika!

537
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,210
It's a trap!

538
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:49,750
Chief! Wake her up! Hurry!

539
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,300
What a lovely sight.

540
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:08,560
Osanai! What's this? Let me go!

541
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,980
But I finally caught you.

542
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:14,070
Where is Tokita?

543
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,400
I have no interest in such ugly things.

544
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:24,080
Of course, because you're not.
You were Himuro's idol after all.

545
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,490
Shut up! Just shut up!

546
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,250
You sold your body
for the DC Mini, didn't you?

547
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,540
Don't remind me!

548
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,630
- You coward!
- Stop it!

549
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,510
This is my sanctuary,
and you'll do as I say.

550
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:46,560
- I'm a special person.
- Yes, hand-chosen by the chairman.

551
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,310
Osanai, you used to be
smarter than that.

552
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,020
You don't know its true power!

553
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,690
The DC Mini was,
in a way, complete.

554
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,200
No, better than complete.

555
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:04,620
We can now go back and forth
between dreams and reality...

556
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,950
...even without the DC Mini,
while awake.

557
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:11,290
You were the one who set up Atsuko
at Himura's place.

558
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:17,630
It was just a friendly warning
to a terrorist threatening dreams.

559
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,630
You're just like an old baldy I know.

560
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:27,220
We are the chosen ones assigned
to protect the sanctuary...

561
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:32,390
...threatened by technology
that has lost its philosophy.

562
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,190
You're just twisted.

563
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,110
You should understand.

564
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:39,030
Dreams are so sacred
they cannot be controlled-

565
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:43,910
What would you know? You're just
a little man controlled by jealousy.

566
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,830
You really think
you can beat Tokita?

567
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,000
I warned you,
don't make me get rough.

568
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,060
You should call it a night.

569
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:15,060
Don't worry, I'm drunk.

570
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:19,070
The fact that I know I'm drunk
is proof that I'm sober.

571
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,530
This isn't a real bar...

572
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:26,160
...and this isn't real alcohol,
and you're not a real bartender.

573
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,660
Right?

574
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,790
I'm sober...

575
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:38,040
...even if odds and sods
go around in my head.

576
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,630
Paprika will come, right?

577
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,600
Do you not like the number 17?

578
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,440
The conspiratorial 17.

579
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:06,360
You're familiar with movies
as if you've made them before.

580
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:13,240
I did. Shot an independent
on an 8mm.

581
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,250
It was child's play.

582
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,920
When you were in high school?

583
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,290
When I was 17-

584
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,980
It's a silly cop story.

585
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,740
Two men
who used to be best friends...

586
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:50,910
...are now fugitive and cop
engaged in a chase.

587
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,290
They just keep running...

588
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,620
...and flashbacks of their past
play throughout.

589
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,630
Very experimental.

590
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,800
That guy...

591
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,050
How could I have forgotten
about him until now?

592
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:15,430
He was always one step
ahead of me.

593
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,060
He was smart and popular
with the girls.

594
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:23,570
I could never catch up with him.

595
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:29,950
I was frustrated at myself
for not being frustrated with him.

596
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,740
He really was a good guy.

597
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:36,330
We talked about
making movies together.

598
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:43,080
But I gave up.
I didn't have the confidence.

599
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:46,380
I left the unfinished movie
for him to deal with.

600
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,470
And that friend now?

601
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,630
He died.

602
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,730
He had just gotten accepted
to film school, but he was sick.

603
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:03,230
He didn't tell me.

604
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:06,150
I betrayed him.

605
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,650
I was his partner.
I was his counterpart.

606
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,610
He was the other-

607
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,780
The other me.

608
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,970
But what about the rest of it?!

609
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:35,330
Wait!

610
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,870
- Why do you dress like a girl?
- Paprika!

611
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,540
The real you is
more befitting of me.

612
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:03,500
Paprika!

613
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,340
Stop, please...

614
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:12,760
...you jealous, perverted prince!

615
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:17,180
You have a bad habit of trying
to manipulate people with your words.

616
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:20,470
And you think you can
manipulate people with power?

617
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:23,310
In here, yes.

618
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,170
I love you.

619
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,740
I love you as you are.

620
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:20,530
I will show no mercy
for those who defy me.

621
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,990
Chairman...

622
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,210
You cannot hide anything from me.

623
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,470
Chairman, not her. Not her!

624
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:39,510
Can you not control
even one sensual desire?

625
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,730
Please! Please spare her!

626
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:51,690
Why won't you obey me?
You are nothing without me!

627
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:56,950
But I love her.

628
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:08,540
Paprika!

629
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,210
Are you okay?

630
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,720
I knew you were Paprika.

631
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:25,180
What are you doing? You will obey!

632
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,400
Disgusting.

633
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:42,370
You fool.
Swayed by a mere woman.

634
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:01,800
I'm too anxious to dream!

635
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:04,680
Konakawa?

636
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:07,720
Shima? Is that you?

637
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:09,390
Konakawa.

638
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:14,190
- Why are you in Chiba's dream?
- Why are you a monkey?

639
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,570
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later. Just go!

640
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:19,280
Go where?

641
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,740
To your dream!

642
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,010
Don't get in the way of my dream!

643
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,930
This is my dream. You get out!

644
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:54,190
I am justice!

645
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,700
Freeze!

646
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,410
How's that for traumatic?

647
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:21,210
What about the rest of it?!

648
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:26,140
It's coming up right now!

649
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,140
This time, I'll end it!

650
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,730
That hurts.

651
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,570
It's over.

652
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,130
Chief.

653
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,170
Is this really the real world?

654
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,590
I think so.

655
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:48,300
See? It hurt a lot.

656
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:57,190
But why was Konakawa in your dream?

657
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,900
That's right, Paprika was saved
by Mr. Konakawa.

658
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:06,190
The chairman and Osanai...

659
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,280
Tokita! What about Tokita?

660
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,510
Osanai! What's wrong?

661
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:27,840
Osanai!

662
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:34,060
No! No! Osanai! You can't go!

663
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,810
That body is mine!
I will not allow you to act on your own!

664
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:42,690
My noble spirit needs that body!

665
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:48,990
When the two become one,
I will be complete!

666
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,120
Something's wrong.

667
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:59,410
Not just Tokita, but what
just happened with Osanai.

668
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:03,210
Don't worry.
We just need to get the mastermind.

669
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,250
A happy ending
is right around the corner.

670
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:11,470
But that mastermind
is lost in his own delusion.

671
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,640
No problem.

672
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:16,060
We have backup.

673
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:17,890
Mr. Konakawa.

674
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,730
The number you called for
assisting young children...

675
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:28,740
...is not available because of
crowded tires in the Pacific Ocean...

676
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,320
...starting at 7:63 a. m.

677
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,730
The battle has ended.

678
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:11,570
Now it's showtime!

679
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:39,930
Today's weather is dreamy...

680
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:43,640
...and will clear up after a sunny,
sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny day.

681
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:47,110
The dream I had yesterday
and today.

682
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:49,860
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

683
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:55,160
The dreams will grow and grow.
Let's grow the tree that blooms money.

684
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,780
It's most valuable
while it's still a bud.

685
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:01,910
That's right, so we shall preserve
the memory forever.

686
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:05,870
If there is no flower,
there will be no fruit.

687
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,670
If there's nothing,
then I won't do anything.

688
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:15,180
If you're unhappy,
please put a vote in this eyeball.

689
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:18,850
Who would give up this throne?

690
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:22,560
I am the emperor,
chosen by the lord himself!

691
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,680
- I didn't choose you!
- I didn't choose you!

692
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:28,100
God and Buddha
will change religions.

693
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:35,240
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

694
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,660
Am I still dreaming?

695
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:42,490
Yes, the whole world is.

696
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:48,750
You forgot this.

697
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:52,050
Thank you.

698
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:54,460
- Now, let's go.
- Where?

699
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:58,010
To clean up this mess.

700
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,350
Dreams and reality are merging?

701
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,020
Is this because of the DC Mini too?

702
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,450
Chief! Hold on!

703
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,760
Paprika?

704
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,890
No time for questions. Hurry up!

705
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,850
Why are you here?

706
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,110
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

707
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,110
Hurry! We have to get
the mastermind!

708
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,450
It's as if we're in a dream.

709
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,250
Hurry!

710
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,120
Don't get ahead
of yourself, Paprika!

711
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:16,250
Don't think you're always right.

712
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,450
Tokita.

713
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:52,000
- Let's go, Atsuko.
- I have to help Tokita.

714
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:54,540
Leave that irresponsible fatso.

715
01:14:56,170 --> 01:15:00,550
Why don't you listen?
You're a part of me!

716
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,930
Have you ever thought
that maybe you are a part of me?

717
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:06,390
Do as I say!

718
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,940
To think that you can control
yourself and others.

719
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,400
You're just like an old baldy I know.

720
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:24,070
Let's go. We need to stop
that old baldy and his excursions.

721
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:25,360
- Now!
- No!

722
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,130
I can't just leave Tokita because I...

723
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,370
Because what?

724
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:39,880
Chiba!

725
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:44,050
She's become true to herself,
hasn't she?

726
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,050
An overweight spirit needs no diet!

727
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,390
Go forward, superhero,
to anywhere you please!

728
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,060
Tokita, wake up! It's me!

729
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:57,730
The one I've been waiting for
since historic times!

730
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:00,440
Your flute's melody
is a sound for sore neurons!

731
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:02,110
Yes, try to remember.

732
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,700
Atsuko, the one you like!
It's me, At-chan!

733
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,080
A fragrant fat is a first-class lunch!

734
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:17,790
It needs a little more spice.

735
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:20,670
Maybe a little paprika?

736
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,280
What is this?

737
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,280
A big hole.

738
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:47,770
I can see that!

739
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:52,950
- It's connected.
- To the other world.

740
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:57,370
The other- You mean...?

741
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:00,460
What should we do?

742
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,130
- Run?
- You think so too?

743
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,640
Well-rounded achievement
is missing a spice.

744
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,560
Paprika found!

745
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:37,250
Paprika! Shima!
Are you two okay?

746
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,170
- Mr. Konakawa!
- Konakawa.

747
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:54,470
Chiba?

748
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:07,110
I'm in a bind.

749
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,320
I can see that.

750
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,990
It's not that!

751
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:34,720
Sorry.

752
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:38,770
You're such a slob.

753
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,730
I know.

754
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:45,440
You're fat, slow and sloppy.

755
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,740
It's not the outside that counts,
but there's a limit to that too.

756
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:53,570
Yeah.

757
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:58,700
To think, a food disposal like you
is the genius of the century.

758
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,460
I swallow everything.

759
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:08,380
I know. You're so much fun.

760
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:15,970
Atsuko is dreaming.

761
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:35,200
- What is that?
- Our chairman!

762
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:37,780
I feel great!

763
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:41,200
I am reborn!

764
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:50,550
Look! I am standing!
With my own legs!

765
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:51,970
I am perfect!

766
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:56,970
I can control the dreams,
and even death!

767
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,390
Now, to make
the cosmos complete...

768
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:05,900
...I shall heal all deficiencies!

769
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,940
Way to go, Lord of Darkness!

770
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:17,410
Light and dark. Reality and dreams.
Life and death. Man and...?

771
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:19,870
- Woman?
- Woman?

772
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:22,870
Then you add the missing spice.

773
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,910
- Paprika?
- Paprika?

774
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:27,040
Bingo.

775
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:34,920
Paprika!

776
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:40,350
The new cosmos begins with me!

777
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,610
Who is eating up my dream?

778
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:38,990
Is that Paprika?

779
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,240
Well, it's a girl.

780
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,710
Why won't you obey?

781
01:22:57,030 --> 01:23:00,650
Have we awoken from the dream?

782
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,760
I just had the best dream.

783
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:29,770
I had a good dream too.
The first in a long time.

784
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:45,910
- I guess I've been dumped.
- You mean you were serious?

785
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:48,950
But Paprika is a woman
in your dreams.

786
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:53,540
That's true. I'll see her
in my dreams again some day.

787
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:58,710
How are your dreams going?

788
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,840
I almost forgot about it.

789
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,720
Did you find out
what was causing it?

790
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:06,720
The cause...

791
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,730
You didn't do anything wrong.

792
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,690
You just lived out our movie
in real life.

793
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:21,990
That's why you became a cop.

794
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:26,740
It's truth that came from fiction.
Always remember that.

795
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:31,080
Yeah, all the truths and the fiction.

796
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:42,570
Welcome.

797
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:51,100
I have a message for you
from Miss Paprika.

798
01:24:55,730 --> 01:25:00,650
I heard you caught the perpetrator in
that homicide case. Congratulations.

799
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:03,070
I also have an announcement:

800
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:08,620
Atsuko's last name
will change to Tokita.

801
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:11,870
P.S.

802
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:16,500
The movie Dreaming Kids
was very good. I recommend it.

803
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:31,510
Dreaming Kids

804
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:42,050
One adult, please.
