00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,807
Look, l. . .
l can`t let you do that.

Not tonight.

344
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,273
l don`t mind having
this discussion with you.

345
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,026
l actually enjoy
the thoughtful
exchange of ideas.

346
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,612
And you do bring
up a valid point.
Know what l`m sayin`?

347
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,532
But see, you put me in
a bit of a spot, nigga.

348
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,076
`Cause l can`t have
you back-talkin` me
in front of my niggas

349
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,578
without at least
fuckin` your ass up.

350
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,288
You feel me?
Oh, look, you don`t
have to do that.

351
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,667

l mean, l don`t want to.
lt`s my birthday and shit.

Hey, look, they in, Dom.
lt`s all good.

354
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,548
l know they got in.
That`s my point.

355
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,716
But l got this nigga
telling me what he

356
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,094
can`t let me do and shit.
Like l give a fuck!

357
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,055
Man, if l let this shit slide,
we got what they call
a slippery slope.

358
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,765
You know what
a slippery slope is, nigga?

359
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,393
No. l don`t. . . l don`t

Nigga, sit your

363
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,859
l know using your brain
is a challenge and shit.

364
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:50,986
You said slope,
you ski on a slope. . .

365
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,696
You might fuck around,
give yourself a concussion.

366
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,198
lt`s a small event that leads
to a chain reaction of events

367
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,408
with unintended consequences

368
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,828

at the time
of the inciting event.

See, this is
a smart little nigga
right in here, bro.

370
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,796

l just know that he told me
to deliver it to A.J. , so. . .

1125
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,648
And why did you do it?

You`re a smart kid.
l`m sure you thought
about all of them.

1130
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:53,790
But you chose to
make the delivery
for this Dom person. . .

1131
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,835
Because you thought it was,
what, in your best interest?

1132
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,759
So, you should
take responsibility

1133

that you`ve made.

Yeah, okay. All right.

1146
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,337
So, you order
a Casey Veggies CD
from Amazon, right?

1147
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:45,508
No, you don`t order
a Casey Veggies CD.

1148
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,677
You just go online
and you download it.

1149
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,554
Yeah, okay. All right.

1150
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:53,599
But you are aware
that Amazon does
ship discs, right?

1151
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,601
And if you
order that disk

1152
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,186
and it does not come
in a timely fashion,

1153
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,605
you`re gonna call them
and you`re gonna say,
``Where`s my stuff?``

1154
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,732
And Amazon has to
assume responsibility.

1155
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,693
But it`s just one CD.

1156
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:08,406
But what if it`s 1 00 orders
and 1 00 CDs don`t show up?

1157
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,950
Or a thousand? Or 1 0,000?

1158
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,369
lt`s a slippery slope.

1159
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,121
Slippery slope.

1160
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:18,374
So, Amazon has got to assume

1161
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,168
the full cost of the loss.

1162
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,962
But most importantly,

1163
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,215
they have to deal
with the loss of
their reputation.

1164
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,635
A reputation that has taken
a long time to build.

1165
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,387
You understand
what l`m saying?

1166
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,432

1167
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,184

this interview

1168
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:41,522

consumers,

1173
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,202
so that the suppliers
of this product can be whole.

1174
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,414
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

1175
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,207
lf you`re able to do this,

1176
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:05,421
it shows me more about you
than any interview ever could.

1177
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,507
And l would then
make it my business

1178

to make you a man of Harvard.

your Bitcoin account
to a bank account,

1682
01:20:57,436 --> 01:21:00,563
and then there`s this
infinitesimally small chance

1683
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:01,689
that it could be traced.

1684
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,274

stumble upon randomly.

MR. BAlLEY: MaIcoIm.

1868
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,456
You`re pretty damn arrogant.

1869
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:45,874
You think you`re gonna
get into Harvard?

1870
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,419
Who do you think you are?

1871
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:05,769
Let me tell you
about two students.

1872
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,232
MALCOLM: Student "A``
is a straight-A student

1873
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:11,859
who Iives in the suburbs
of Los Angeles.

1874
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:18,032
He plays in a punk band
with his best friends.

1875
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:21,035
He Ioves to skateboard
and ride on his BMX bike.

1876
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:23,203
His favorite TV show
is Game of Thrones

1877
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:25,414
and his favorite band
is The ThermaIs.

1878
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:28,208
He`s a `90s hip-hop geek.

1879
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:31,336
Student ``B`` goes to
an underfunded school,

1880
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,589
where teachers who wouId
rather not be there

1881
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:37,134
teach kids
who really don`t care.

1882
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,302
He Iives with
a single mother,

1883
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,305
doesn`t know his father
and has sold dope.

1884
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:44,516
Now close your eyes.

1885
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:49,063
Picture each of these kids
and tell me what you see.

1886
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,940
Be honest. No one`s
going to judge you.

1887
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:53,150
Now open your eyes.

1888
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:56,236
So, am l student
``A`` or student ``B``?

1889
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:57,988
Am l a geek or a menace?

1890
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:01,033
For most of my life,
l`ve been caught in
between who l really am

1891
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:02,493
and how l`m perceived,

1892
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,079
in between categories
and definition.

1893
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:07,790
l don`t fit in.

1894
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:11,126
And l used to think that
that was a curse,

1895
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:13,962
but now l`m slowly
starting to see

1896
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,590
maybe it`s a blessing.

1897
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:19,426
See, when you don`t fit in,
you`re forced to see the world

1898
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:21,595
from many different angles
and points of view.

1899
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,098
You gain knowledge,
life lessons

1900
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,558
from disparate people
and places.

1901
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:29,812
And those lessons,
for better or worse,
have shaped me.

1902
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:31,313
So, who am l?

1903
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:33,065

reintroduce myself.

l taught myself
how to play guitar
and read music.

1908
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:42,282
l have stellar

extra-curricular activities.
