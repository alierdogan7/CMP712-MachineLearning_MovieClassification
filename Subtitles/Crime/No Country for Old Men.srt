1
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,506
I was sheriff of this county when I was
twenty-five years old.

2
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:44,104
Hard to believe.

3
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,803
Grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.

4
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:53,461
Me and him was sheriff at the same time,
him up in Plano and me out here.

5
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:56,034
I think he was pretty proud of that.

6
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:58,442
I know I was.

7
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,052
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

8
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:06,008
A lot of folks find that
hard to believe.

9
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,642
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

10
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:08,707
That the younger Jim.

11
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,284
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Commanche County.

12
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,418
Now I always liked to hear about
the old-timers.

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,430
Never missed a chance to do so.

14
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:23,836
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

15
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,702
Can't help but wonder how they
would've operated these times.

16
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:32,905
There is this boy I sent to the electric
chair in Huntsville here a while back.

17
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:36,833
My arrest and my testimony.

18
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:40,749
He killed a fourteen-year-old girl.

19
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:47,093
Papers said it was a crime of passion but
he told me there wasn't any passion to it.

20
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:52,017
Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody
for about as long as he could remember.

21
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:54,076
Said if they turned him out he'd do it again.

22
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:56,091
Said he knew he was going to hell.

23
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:59,111
Be there in about fifteen minutes.

24
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:01,353
I don't know what to make of that.

25
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,248
I surely don't.

26
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:09,069
The crime you see now, it's hard
to even take its measure.

27
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:12,924
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

28
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,486
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

29
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:22,350
But I don't want to push my chips forward...

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,694
...and go out and meet something
I don't understand.

31
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,493
A man would have to put his soul at hazard.

32
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,185
He just have to say, okay.

33
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,136
I'll be part of this world.

34
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,249
Yessir, I just walked in the door.

35
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:51,038
Sheriff he had some sort of
thing on him like a...

36
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:53,729
...oxygen tanks for emphysema or something.

37
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:56,425
And a hose that run down his sleeve...

38
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:00,240
You got me.

39
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,141
You'll look at it when you get in.

40
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,857
Yessir, I got it under control.

41
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,089
Howdy, what's this about?

42
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,568
Step out of the car please, sir.

43
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:47,894
What is it?

44
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,604
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

45
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,659
What is that for?

46
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:03,529
Would you hold still please, sir.

47
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:34,575
Hold still.

48
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,144
Agua.

49
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,738
...Agua. Por Dios.

50
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:34,248
Agua.

51
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,535
I ain't got no water.

52
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,093
Agua.

53
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:55,623
I ain't got no agua.

54
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:11,865
You speak English?

55
00:10:14,376 --> 00:10:15,711
Where's the last guy?

56
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:17,865
Ultimo hombre.

57
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:19,698
Last man standing.
There must've been one.

58
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:20,423
Where'd he go?

59
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:29,559
I reckon I'd go out the way I came in.

60
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:31,678
La puerta...

61
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,712
Hay lobos...

62
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:37,519
Ain't no lobos.

63
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,968
If you stopped and watch your backtrack,
you're gonna shoot my dumb ass.

64
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:07,019
But if you stopped, you
stopped in the shade.

65
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,790
What's in the satchel?

66
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:30,848
It's full of money.

67
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,000
That'll be the day.

68
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,585
Where'd you get the pistol?

69
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,922
At the gettin' place.

70
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:39,421
Did you buy that gun?

71
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:41,176
No. I found it.

72
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:44,665
Welyn!

73
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,105
What?

74
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:46,192
Quit your hollering.

75
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:48,753
What'd you give for that thing?

76
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:52,633
You don't need to know everything, Carla Jean.

77
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:55,048
I need to know that.

78
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:59,208
You keep running that mouth of yours I'm gonna
take you in the back and screw you.

79
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,182
Big talk.

80
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:02,484
Keep it up.

81
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:05,453
Fine. I don't wanna know.

82
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,278
I don't even wanna know
where you been all day.

83
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:11,495
That'll work.

84
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:26,844
Alright.

85
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:34,677
Llewelyn.

86
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:36,057
Yeah?

87
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:39,677
What're you doing, baby?

88
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:41,787
I'm going out.

89
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:42,939
Going where?

90
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,179
Something I forgot to do but I'll be back.

91
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:48,441
What're you going to do?

92
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:52,117
I'm fixing to do something dumber
now but I'm going anyways.

93
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:56,963
If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.

94
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:00,144
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

95
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,933
Well then. I'll tell her myself.

96
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:00,986
How much?

97
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:02,678
Sixty-nine cents.

98
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,272
And the gas.

99
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:07,231
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

100
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:09,878
What way would that be?

101
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:11,617
I seen you was from Dallas.

102
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:19,728
What business is it of yours
where I'm from, friendo?

103
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,862
I didn't mean nothing by it.

104
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:25,400
Didn't mean nothing.

105
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,861
Just passing my time.

106
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:33,537
If you don't wanna accept that I don't
know what else I can do for you.

107
00:21:36,747 --> 00:21:37,964
Will there be something else?

108
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,468
I don't know. Will there?

109
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:47,718
Is somethin wrong?

110
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,495
With what?

111
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:49,238
With anything?

112
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:52,289
Is that what you're asking me?

113
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:54,827
Is there something wrong with anything?

114
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:56,982
Will there be anything else?

115
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:57,893
You already asked me that.

116
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:04,091
Well... I need to see about closing.

117
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,762
See about closing.

118
00:22:05,863 --> 00:22:06,358
Yessir.

119
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,439
What time do you close?

120
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,081
Now. We close now.

121
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:09,868
Now is not a time.

122
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:11,099
What time do you close?

123
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,828
Generally around dark. At dark.

124
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,685
You don't know what you're
talking about, do you?

125
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:20,263
Sir?

126
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:25,289
I said you don't know what you're
talking about.

127
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,559
What time do you go to bed?

128
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:30,746
Sir?

129
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:32,475
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?

130
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,385
I said what time do you go to bed?

131
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,408
Somewhere around 9:30.

132
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,952
I'd say around 9:30.

133
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:44,157
I could come back then.

134
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:45,491
Why would you be coming back?

135
00:22:45,492 --> 00:22:46,492
We'd be closed.

136
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:47,477
Yeah. You said that.

137
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:51,523
Well... I got to close now.

138
00:22:51,524 --> 00:22:53,073
You live in that house out back?

139
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:56,181
Yes I do.

140
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,526
You lived here all your life?

141
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,935
This is my wife's father's place. Originally.

142
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:07,658
You married into it.

143
00:23:08,377 --> 00:23:11,004
We lived in Temple Texas for many years.

144
00:23:12,484 --> 00:23:13,922
Raised a family there.

145
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:15,969
In Temple.

146
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,060
We come out here about four years ago.

147
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:19,905
You married into it.

148
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:22,216
If that's the way you wanna put it.

149
00:23:22,474 --> 00:23:24,180
I don't have some way to put it.

150
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:26,364
That's the way it is.

151
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,114
What's the most you've ever
lost in a coin toss?

152
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:39,004
Sir?

153
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:42,308
The most you ever lost in a coin toss.

154
00:23:44,494 --> 00:23:46,061
I don't know. I couldn't say.

155
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,023
Call it.

156
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,293
Call it?

157
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:51,905
Yes.

158
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:53,254
For what?

159
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:54,269
Just call it.

160
00:23:57,407 --> 00:24:01,064
Well, we need to know what
we're calling it for here.

161
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,101
You need to call it.

162
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:03,891
I can't call it for you.

163
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:05,958
It wouldn't be fair.

164
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,647
I didn't put nothing up.

165
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:08,920
Yes, you did.

166
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:11,254
You've been putting it up your whole life.

167
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:12,323
You just didn't know it.

168
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,465
You know what date is on this coin?

169
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:16,740
No.

170
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:17,671
1958.

171
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:20,802
It's been traveling twenty-two
years to get here.

172
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,291
And now it's here.

173
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:24,626
And it's either heads or tails.

174
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,397
And you have to say. Call it.

175
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:30,778
Look... I need to know what I stand to win.

176
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:31,900
Everything.

177
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:33,798
How's that?

178
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,970
You stand to win everything. Call it.

179
00:24:40,753 --> 00:24:43,868
Alright. Heads then.

180
00:24:48,648 --> 00:24:49,578
Well done.

181
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:52,900
Don't put it in your pocket.

182
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,923
Sir?

183
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:55,960
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

184
00:24:58,225 --> 00:24:59,286
Where you want me to put it?

185
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:00,497
Anywhere not in your pocket.

186
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:04,787
Or it'll be mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

187
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:09,824
Which it is.

188
00:25:21,862 --> 00:25:22,682
Llewelyn?

189
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,562
What the hell?

190
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:29,627
Odessa.

191
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,849
Why would we go to Odessa?

192
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,805
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

193
00:25:35,642 --> 00:25:36,470
Well, how come?

194
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,896
Right now it's midnight Sunday.

195
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:41,096
When the courthouse opens nine hours from now,...

196
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:44,490
...someone's gonna be callin' in the vehicle
number on the inspection plate on the truck.

197
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:46,960
And by 9:30, they'll show up here.

198
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:48,991
But for how long do we have to...

199
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:52,231
Baby, at what point would you quit bothering
to look for your two million dollars?

200
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:55,033
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

201
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:58,503
Try standin' in the door and holler
"Mama, I'm home".

202
00:25:58,504 --> 00:25:59,325
Llewelyn...

203
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:00,246
C'mon, pack your things.

204
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:02,867
Anything you leave you ain't
gonna see it again.

205
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:08,612
Well, thanks for falling all over
and apologizing.

206
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:13,459
Baby, things happened.
I can't take 'em back.

207
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,050
Mind ridin', bitch?

208
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,394
This his truck?

209
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:53,433
Mm-Mm.

210
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:58,806
Got a screwgie?

211
00:27:02,777 --> 00:27:04,023
Who cut his tires?

212
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:06,680
Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

213
00:27:08,081 --> 00:27:09,524
That's a dead dog.

214
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:10,692
Yes, it is.

215
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:15,809
Where's the receiver?

216
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,967
I've got it.

217
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,099
They're ripe petunias.

218
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:22,976
Hold this please.

219
00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:32,484
You want it?

220
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:36,153
You getting anything though?

221
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:37,976
Not a bleep.

222
00:27:39,218 --> 00:27:40,108
Alright...

223
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:44,331
Gimme that.

224
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:56,801
I thought it was a car afire.

225
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:57,805
It is a car afire.

226
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:00,084
But Wnedell said there was
something backcountry too.

227
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,381
When is the county gonna start
paying a rental on my horse?

228
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:06,893
I love you more and more everyday.

229
00:28:07,156 --> 00:28:08,296
That's very nice.

230
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:10,636
Be careful.

231
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:11,129
Always am.

232
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:12,328
Don't get hurt.

233
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:13,132
Never do.

234
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:14,482
Don't hurt no one.

235
00:28:17,643 --> 00:28:18,579
If you say so.

236
00:28:53,646 --> 00:28:56,250
Wouldn't think a car would burn like that.

237
00:28:56,354 --> 00:28:59,806
Yessir. We should've brought weenies.

238
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:02,406
That look like about a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

239
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:03,823
It could be.

240
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:05,878
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

241
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:07,771
The old boy shot by the highway?

242
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:10,118
Yessir, his vehicle.

243
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:13,788
Man killed Lamar's deputy and took his car.

244
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,239
Killed that man on the highway,...

245
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,600
...swapped for his car...

246
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:20,024
...and now here it is and he's swapped
again for god knows what.

247
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:24,019
That's very linear, Sheriff.

248
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:26,072
Well. Old age flattens a man.

249
00:29:26,073 --> 00:29:29,738
Yessir. But then there's this other.

250
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:33,377
You ride Winston.

251
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,657
- You sure?
- Oh, I'm more than sure.

252
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:38,349
Anything happens to Loretta's horse out here,...

253
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,313
...I can tell you right now I don't wanna be
the party that was aboard.

254
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:45,416
It's the same tire tread comin back as going.

255
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,800
Made about the same time too.
You can see the sipes real clear.

256
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:54,077
Somebodies pried the inspection
plate off the door on this one.

257
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:58,533
I know this truck.

258
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,994
Belongs to a fella named Moss.

259
00:30:01,354 --> 00:30:03,660
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

260
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:05,790
You figure him for a doperunner?

261
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:09,770
I don't know but I kindly doubt it.

262
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:12,033
Restul sunt acolo.

263
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:16,485
Oh hell's bells, they even shot the dog.

264
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:22,271
Well this is just a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

265
00:30:22,272 --> 00:30:26,192
Yeah, appears to have been a glitch or two.

266
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:31,975
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?

267
00:30:31,976 --> 00:30:36,439
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.

268
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:41,131
Somebody unloaded on that thing with a shotgun.

269
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:45,867
How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?

270
00:30:45,868 --> 00:30:47,712
I don't know.

271
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,685
Supposedly coyotes won't eat a Mexican.

272
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:58,614
These boys appear to be managerial.

273
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:01,464
I think we're lookin at more than one fracas...

274
00:31:01,465 --> 00:31:03,009
Execution here...

275
00:31:03,016 --> 00:31:04,913
...Wild West over there

276
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:08,212
That Mexican brown dope.

277
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:10,464
These boys is all swole up.

278
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:13,431
So this was earlier, getting set to trade.

279
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,904
Then, whoa, differences...

280
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:18,619
You know might not of even been no money.

281
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,103
That's possible.

282
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:21,947
But you don't believe it.

283
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:25,490
No. Probably I don't.

284
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,819
Well, it's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?

285
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:36,405
If it ain't, it'll do till a mess gets here.

286
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:30,670
Yessir?

287
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:33,666
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

288
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,798
Did you go up to his trailer?

289
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:36,639
Yes.

290
00:33:37,238 --> 00:33:40,491
Well, I'd say he's at work. Do you
want to leave a message?

291
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:41,613
Where does he work?

292
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:43,189
I can't say.

293
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,082
Where does he work?

294
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:51,525
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

295
00:33:52,524 --> 00:33:54,365
Where does he work?

296
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:59,849
Did you not hear me? We can't give
out no information.

297
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,033
Why all the way to Del Rio?

298
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:26,389
I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

299
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,016
You can't afford one?

300
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,496
I don't wanna register it.

301
00:34:30,497 --> 00:34:32,273
Look, I'll call you in a couple days.

302
00:34:32,274 --> 00:34:34,361
- Promise?
- Yes, I do.

303
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:37,377
I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.

304
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:39,882
Well I got a good one.
So, they ought to even out.

305
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:43,226
Quit worrying so much.

306
00:34:43,807 --> 00:34:45,236
Mama's gonna raise hell.

307
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:47,839
She is just gonna curse you
up and down.

308
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,831
You should be used to that.

309
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:52,766
I'm used to lots of things,
I work at Wal-Mart.

310
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:56,260
Not any more, Carla Jean.
You're retired.

311
00:34:56,536 --> 00:34:58,955
- Llewelyn?
- Yes ma'am?

312
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:05,643
- You are comin back, ain't ya?
- I shall return.

313
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:12,381
Sheriff's Department!

314
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,997
Look at that lock.

315
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:19,794
We goin' in?

316
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:21,571
Gun out and up.

317
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:28,283
- What about yours?
- I'm hidin behind you.

318
00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:33,021
Sheriff's Department!

319
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:01,167
I believe they've lit a shuck.

320
00:36:01,168 --> 00:36:02,508
I believe you're right.

321
00:36:02,509 --> 00:36:04,067
That from the lock?

322
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,138
Probably must be.

323
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:07,759
When was he here, Sheriff?

324
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,501
I don't know.

325
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:11,680
Oh. Now that's aggravating.

326
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,726
Sheriff?

327
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:14,271
Still sweating.

328
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:18,068
Oh, Sheriff, we just missed him!

329
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:22,197
We gotta circulate this. On radio.

330
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:24,243
Alright.

331
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:27,339
What do we circulate?

332
00:36:29,669 --> 00:36:32,868
Lookin for a man who has
recently drunk milk?

333
00:36:36,137 --> 00:36:38,701
Ah, Sheriff, that's aggravating.

334
00:36:38,702 --> 00:36:40,868
I'm ahead of you there.

335
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:47,606
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of
the sorts of sons of bitches that are hunting him?

336
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:49,777
I don't know. He ought to...

337
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,936
He seen the same things I've seen,...

338
00:36:54,937 --> 00:36:57,995
...and it certainly made an impression on me.

339
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:05,948
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

340
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:07,590
Someplace cheap.

341
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:11,671
You tell me the option.

342
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:13,020
Do what now?

343
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:16,711
You pick the option goes with the applicable rate.

344
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:21,545
I'm just one person. So, don't
matter the size of the bed.

345
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,629
<i>This is Roberto Sagramore,
I'm not here right now.</i>

346
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,033
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

347
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:32,636
Hello?

348
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:35,134
Is Llewelyn there?

349
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:38,103
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.

350
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:40,620
You expect him?

351
00:39:40,621 --> 00:39:42,540
Now why would I expect him?

352
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,751
Who's this?

353
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:53,903
Can I help you?

354
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:57,115
Yeah. You got a pair of Larry Mahan's,
shoulder size 11.

355
00:39:57,116 --> 00:39:58,541
I'll check.

356
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,482
- You sell socks?
- Just white.

357
00:40:00,518 --> 00:40:02,325
White is all I wear.

358
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:04,104
You got a bathroom?

359
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:33,128
Don't stop. Just ride me
up past those rooms.

360
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,500
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

361
00:40:36,925 --> 00:40:38,735
I want to see if someone's here.

362
00:40:46,702 --> 00:40:48,373
Keep going. Don't stop.

363
00:40:48,816 --> 00:40:51,677
I don't wanna get into some
kind of a jackpot here, buddy.

364
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:53,031
It's alright.

365
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:56,840
Why don't I just set you down around here
and we won't argue about it.

366
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:59,438
Take me to another motel.

367
00:40:59,564 --> 00:41:00,972
Let's just call it square.

368
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:03,956
Look, you're already in a jackpot.
I'm trying to get you out of it.

369
00:41:03,957 --> 00:41:05,656
Now take me to another motel.

370
00:41:55,248 --> 00:41:57,751
The lab reports from Austin on
that boy by the highway.

371
00:41:57,752 --> 00:41:58,973
What was the bullet?

372
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,388
There wasn't no bullet.

373
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,608
Wasn't no bullet?

374
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:04,481
Yessir. Wasn't none.

375
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:09,715
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

376
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:11,341
No sir.

377
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,171
You said entry wound in the forehead.

378
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:15,501
No exit wound.

379
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:16,375
Yes sir.

380
00:42:16,376 --> 00:42:18,241
Are you telling he shot this boy in the head...

381
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:20,357
...and then went digging around in
there with a pocket knife?

382
00:42:21,426 --> 00:42:23,406
Sir, I don't want to picture that.

383
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,848
I don't either!

384
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:26,684
Can I freshen that there for you, Sheriff?

385
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,232
Yeah, Noreen, you better had.

386
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:32,703
The Rangers and the DEA are headed back
out to the scene this morning.

387
00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:34,953
You gonna join 'em?

388
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:37,423
Any new bodies accumulated out there?

389
00:42:39,096 --> 00:42:40,348
No sir.

390
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,360
Well then, I guess I can skip it.

391
00:42:57,048 --> 00:42:59,307
Twelve gauge. You need shells?

392
00:42:59,308 --> 00:43:03,332
- Yeah. Double ought.
- They'll give you a wallop.

393
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:05,286
Y'all got camping supplies?

394
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:07,382
Tent poles?

395
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:09,089
You already have a tent?

396
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,304
Somethin' like that.

397
00:43:10,305 --> 00:43:13,099
Well, you give me the model number on the
tent, I can order you the poles.

398
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,630
Never mind. I want a tent.

399
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:17,956
- Well, what kind of tent?
- The kind with the most poles.

400
00:43:40,427 --> 00:43:41,581
Could I get another room?

401
00:43:41,582 --> 00:43:43,145
You want to change rooms?

402
00:43:43,146 --> 00:43:45,649
No m'am, I want to keep my room
and get another one.

403
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,043
Another additional?

404
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:48,327
Yes, m'am.

405
00:43:48,328 --> 00:43:50,525
And do you have a map of the rooms?

406
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:53,655
Yeah, we had a sorta one.

407
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:02,666
How bout 38?

408
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,653
Well, you can have the one right
next to yours if you want.

409
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:07,561
Number 137. It ain't took.

410
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,248
No, 38 will be fine.

411
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,727
That's got two double beds.

412
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:41,094
No me, mate.

413
00:50:47,107 --> 00:50:48,996
How'd you find it?

414
00:50:49,543 --> 00:50:51,657
No me, mate.

415
00:52:35,894 --> 00:52:40,664
Shouldn't be doin' that.
Even a young man like you.

416
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:46,406
- Doin what?
- Hitchhiking.

417
00:52:51,777 --> 00:52:53,814
Dangerous.

418
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:15,080
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

419
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:17,701
Yessir.

420
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:20,406
When did you last see him?

421
00:53:22,624 --> 00:53:25,233
November 28th, last year.

422
00:53:26,345 --> 00:53:29,831
You seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

423
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:30,577
No sir.

424
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:34,458
But you struck me as a man who wouldn't
want to waste a chair.

425
00:53:34,459 --> 00:53:39,138
I remember dates. Names. Numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

426
00:53:41,784 --> 00:53:43,702
We got a loose cannon here.

427
00:53:43,703 --> 00:53:45,045
And we're out a bunch of money,...

428
00:53:45,046 --> 00:53:46,973
...and the other party is out his product.

429
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:47,970
Yessir.

430
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:52,922
This account will give up twelve hundred dollars
in any twenty-four hour period.

431
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:55,015
That's up from a thousand.

432
00:53:55,123 --> 00:53:57,760
If your expenses run higher I hope
you'll trust us for it.

433
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:00,137
Okay.

434
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:03,357
Just how well do you know Chigurh?

435
00:54:03,686 --> 00:54:04,812
What do you want to know?

436
00:54:04,813 --> 00:54:07,262
I just want to know your opinion of him.

437
00:54:07,263 --> 00:54:08,181
In general.

438
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:11,107
Just how dangerous is he?

439
00:54:11,175 --> 00:54:14,064
Compared to what? The bubonic plague?

440
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:16,323
He's bad enough that you called me.

441
00:54:16,408 --> 00:54:20,045
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer but so what?

442
00:54:21,046 --> 00:54:22,533
There's plenty of them around.

443
00:54:22,772 --> 00:54:25,390
He killed three men in Del Rio Motel yesterday.

444
00:54:25,391 --> 00:54:29,176
And two others in that colossal
goatfuck out in the desert.

445
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,922
We can stop that.

446
00:54:30,923 --> 00:54:32,646
You seem pretty sure of yourself.

447
00:54:34,415 --> 00:54:38,369
You've led something of a charmed
life haven't you, Mr. Wells?

448
00:54:38,885 --> 00:54:40,308
In all honesty,...

449
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:43,994
...I can't say that charm has had a
whole lot to do with it.

450
00:54:45,886 --> 00:54:47,309
I'm wondering...

451
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:48,741
Yes?

452
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:52,014
Can I get my parking ticket validated?

453
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:56,870
An attempt at humor, I suppose.

454
00:54:56,907 --> 00:54:58,434
I'm sorry.

455
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:08,856
- You know I counted the floors of this building from the street?
- And?

456
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,311
There's one missing.

457
00:55:13,731 --> 00:55:15,715
We'll look into it.

458
00:55:35,413 --> 00:55:38,093
One room, one night.

459
00:55:38,442 --> 00:55:41,637
- That'll be twenty-six dollars.
- Alright.

460
00:55:45,987 --> 00:55:47,517
You on all night?

461
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:50,531
Yessir, I'll be around here until
ten o'clock in the morning.

462
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:56,092
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

463
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,173
There's someone who's been
lookin for me. Not police.

464
00:55:59,174 --> 00:56:02,688
Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.

465
00:56:02,802 --> 00:56:05,530
By anyone, I mean any swinging dude.

466
00:56:46,518 --> 00:56:49,336
There just ain't no way.

467
01:02:27,095 --> 01:02:28,925
Don't worry. I ain't gonna hurt you.

468
01:02:29,722 --> 01:02:31,731
I need you to drive me on out of here.

469
01:06:10,863 --> 01:06:12,678
Were you in a car accident?

470
01:06:14,677 --> 01:06:17,212
I'll give you five hundred bucks for that coat.

471
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:20,459
Let me see the money.

472
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:24,899
Were you in a car accident?

473
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:27,211
Yeah.

474
01:06:28,612 --> 01:06:31,271
- Gimme the money.
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.

475
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,801
Let him hold the money.

476
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,117
Gimme that beer too.

477
01:06:53,424 --> 01:06:54,775
How much?

478
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,692
Brian. Give him the beer.

479
01:09:09,547 --> 01:09:13,676
Medico. Por favor.

480
01:13:17,938 --> 01:13:19,550
Any word on those vehicles yet?

481
01:13:20,272 --> 01:13:22,610
Sheriff, I found out everything there was to find.

482
01:13:23,255 --> 01:13:26,382
Those vehicles are titled and registered
to deceased people.

483
01:13:27,781 --> 01:13:30,191
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead twenty years.

484
01:13:30,442 --> 01:13:32,580
Did you want me to see what I could
find out about the Mexican ones?

485
01:13:32,985 --> 01:13:34,566
No. Lord no.

486
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,219
Here's this month's checks.

487
01:13:38,516 --> 01:13:40,503
That DEA agent called again.

488
01:13:40,538 --> 01:13:41,616
You don't want to talk to him?

489
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:43,772
I'm goin' to try and keep from it
as much as I can.

490
01:13:44,084 --> 01:13:47,109
He's goin' back out there and he wanted
to know if you wanted to go with him.

491
01:13:47,144 --> 01:13:48,882
That's cordial of him.

492
01:13:49,692 --> 01:13:51,964
Could I get you to call Loretta for me...

493
01:13:51,965 --> 01:13:54,237
...and tell her I'm goin' to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

494
01:13:54,272 --> 01:13:55,721
Yes, Sheriff.

495
01:13:55,756 --> 01:13:57,927
I'll call her when I get there.

496
01:13:57,962 --> 01:14:00,705
I'd call her now but she'll want me to come
home and I just might.

497
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,690
- You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
- Uhuh.

498
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:07,609
You don't want to lie without what
it's absolutely necessary.

499
01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:13,706
What is it that Torbert says
about truth and justice?

500
01:14:14,485 --> 01:14:18,286
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

501
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:21,149
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin'
myself twice daily.

502
01:14:21,184 --> 01:14:23,978
It might come to three times
before it's over...

503
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:26,907
Oh, what the hell?

504
01:14:35,445 --> 01:14:36,771
Sheriff?

505
01:14:38,246 --> 01:14:39,195
Have you looked at your load lately?

506
01:14:41,536 --> 01:14:42,570
That is a damned outrage.

507
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,783
Oh. One of those tiedowns worked lose.

508
01:14:46,033 --> 01:14:47,424
How many bodies did you leave with?

509
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,720
I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff.

510
01:14:51,023 --> 01:14:53,297
Couldn't you all of took a van out there?

511
01:14:53,734 --> 01:14:55,845
Didn't have no van with four-wheel drive.

512
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,566
You going to write me up for
improperly secured load?

513
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,235
You get your ass out of here.

514
01:15:07,476 --> 01:15:10,379
I'm guessin' this isn't the future you had
pictured for yourself...

515
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:13,283
...when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

516
01:15:13,925 --> 01:15:17,300
Don't worry. I'm not the man
that's after you.

517
01:15:17,892 --> 01:15:19,284
I know.

518
01:15:21,176 --> 01:15:23,939
- I've seen him.
- You've seen him?

519
01:15:24,189 --> 01:15:25,984
And you're not dead.

520
01:15:28,142 --> 01:15:31,017
Is this guy supposed to be the
ultimate bad-ass?

521
01:15:31,222 --> 01:15:34,551
- No, I don't think that's how I'd describe him.
- How would you describe him?

522
01:15:35,893 --> 01:15:39,085
I guess I'd say... he doesn't have a
sense of humor.

523
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:41,200
His name is Chigurh.

524
01:15:41,235 --> 01:15:43,880
- Sugar?
- Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

525
01:15:44,602 --> 01:15:47,687
- You know how he found you?
- I know how he found me.

526
01:15:47,722 --> 01:15:50,486
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it is.

527
01:15:51,008 --> 01:15:52,709
He won't find me again.

528
01:15:53,038 --> 01:15:55,047
- Not that way.
- Not any way.

529
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:58,595
- Took me about three hours.
- Yeah, well, I've been immobile.

530
01:15:59,508 --> 01:16:02,051
No. You don't understand.

531
01:16:03,755 --> 01:16:07,332
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

532
01:16:07,534 --> 01:16:09,013
What did you do?

533
01:16:09,048 --> 01:16:11,295
- Welder.
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?

534
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:13,767
Any of it. If it can be welded, I can weld it.

535
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:15,700
- Cast iron?
- Yes.

536
01:16:15,735 --> 01:16:18,037
- I don't mean braze.
- I didn't say braze.

537
01:16:18,072 --> 01:16:20,236
- Pot metal?
- What did I say?

538
01:16:21,821 --> 01:16:23,521
Were you in Nam?

539
01:16:24,957 --> 01:16:26,582
Yeah. I was in Nam.

540
01:16:28,352 --> 01:16:30,195
So was I.

541
01:16:30,578 --> 01:16:32,846
So what does that make me, your buddy?

542
01:16:34,754 --> 01:16:39,235
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

543
01:16:40,485 --> 01:16:42,801
It's too late. I spent it.

544
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:48,524
About a million and a half on whores and whiskey
and the rest of it I just sort of blew it here.

545
01:16:51,475 --> 01:16:54,175
How do you know he's not on his way to Odessa?

546
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:02,174
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- To kill your wife.

547
01:17:09,352 --> 01:17:11,426
Maybe he's the one who needs to be worried.

548
01:17:12,645 --> 01:17:14,926
- About me.
- He isn't.

549
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:19,020
You're not cut out for this.

550
01:17:19,664 --> 01:17:23,584
You're just a guy who happened to
find those vehicles.

551
01:17:28,804 --> 01:17:33,305
I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle.
Carson Wells.

552
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:36,645
Call me when you've had enough.

553
01:17:36,896 --> 01:17:39,351
I can even let you keep a
little of the money.

554
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:40,851
If I was into cutting deals,...

555
01:17:40,852 --> 01:17:43,134
...why wouldn't I just deal
with this guy Chigurh?

556
01:17:43,837 --> 01:17:47,428
You don't understand. You can't
make a deal with him.

557
01:17:47,742 --> 01:17:50,272
Even if you gave him the money back,
he'd still kill you...

558
01:17:50,273 --> 01:17:52,803
...just for inconvenience in him.

559
01:17:53,084 --> 01:17:56,740
He's a peculiar man. Might even say
he has principles.

560
01:17:57,055 --> 01:18:01,856
Principles that transcend money or
drugs or anything like that.

561
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:06,887
He's not like you.
He's not even like me.

562
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:11,368
He don't talk as much as you, I
give him points for that.

563
01:18:13,204 --> 01:18:15,356
Carla Jean. Thank you for comin'.

564
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:16,786
Don't know why I did.

565
01:18:17,494 --> 01:18:20,350
I told you, I don't know where he is.

566
01:18:20,602 --> 01:18:22,647
- You ain't heard from him?
- No I ain't.

567
01:18:22,682 --> 01:18:24,558
- Nothin'?
- Not word one.

568
01:18:24,775 --> 01:18:28,694
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

569
01:18:29,646 --> 01:18:32,959
-  He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

570
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:36,944
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

571
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:41,246
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

572
01:18:41,507 --> 01:18:44,432
He won't neither.
He never has.

573
01:18:45,074 --> 01:18:47,288
He can take all comers.

574
01:18:49,977 --> 01:18:53,400
You know Charlie Walser?
He's got that place out east of Sanderson?

575
01:18:56,586 --> 01:18:59,721
Well you know how they used to slaughter beefs,
hit 'em right there with a maul...

576
01:18:59,756 --> 01:19:01,526
..truss 'em up and slit their throats?

577
01:19:01,982 --> 01:19:04,738
Here Charlie's got one all trussed up
and all set to drain him...

578
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:07,120
...and the beef comes to.
It starts thrashing around.

579
01:19:08,163 --> 01:19:12,312
Six hundred pounds of very pissed-off livestock
if you'll excuse me.

580
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:15,994
Charlie grabs his gun there to shoot the
damn thing in the head...

581
01:19:16,386 --> 01:19:21,792
...but with all the swayin' and then the trashin' it's a glance-shot and
ricochets around and comes back hits Charlie in the shoulder.

582
01:19:21,827 --> 01:19:23,059
You go see Charlie,...

583
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,524
he still can't pick up his right hand for his hat...

584
01:19:26,074 --> 01:19:29,193
The point bein', even in the contest
between man and steer,...

585
01:19:29,194 --> 01:19:31,713
...the issue is not certain.

586
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:44,141
When Llewelyn calls, just tell him
I'll make him safe.

587
01:19:48,963 --> 01:19:51,616
Course they slaughter steers a lot
different these days.

588
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,384
Use a air gun.

589
01:19:54,587 --> 01:19:59,625
Shoots out a little rock, about that far into the brain.
Sucks right back in. Animal never knows what hit him.

590
01:20:02,797 --> 01:20:06,147
- Why you telling me that, Sheriff?
- I don't know.

591
01:20:10,196 --> 01:20:12,305
My mind wanders.

592
01:21:35,358 --> 01:21:36,650
Hello, Carson.

593
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:40,963
Let's go to your room.

594
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:55,935
We don't have to do this.

595
01:21:55,936 --> 01:22:00,339
I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.

596
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:03,586
Why would I let you do that?

597
01:22:03,898 --> 01:22:05,887
I'll make it worth your while.

598
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:09,509
Take you to an ATM. Forteen grand in it.

599
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:11,546
And everybody just walks away.

600
01:22:13,483 --> 01:22:15,233
An ATM...

601
01:22:19,431 --> 01:22:24,272
- I know where the satchel is.
- If you knew, you would have it with you.

602
01:22:24,976 --> 01:22:29,024
Find it from the river bank. I know where it is.

603
01:22:30,265 --> 01:22:32,212
I know something better.

604
01:22:32,855 --> 01:22:34,885
- What's that?
- I know where it's going to be.

605
01:22:36,366 --> 01:22:42,866
- Where is that?
- It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.

606
01:22:44,329 --> 01:22:49,710
You don't know to a certainty.
Twenty minutes it could be here.

607
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:54,076
I do know to a certainty. And you know
what's going to happen now, Carson?

608
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:59,712
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

609
01:23:04,961 --> 01:23:06,357
You go to hell.

610
01:23:08,673 --> 01:23:09,932
Alright.

611
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:11,712
Let me ask you something.

612
01:23:13,764 --> 01:23:18,667
If the rule you followed
brought you to this,...

613
01:23:18,668 --> 01:23:21,119
...of what use was the rule?

614
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:31,054
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

615
01:23:32,106 --> 01:23:34,421
You mean the nature of this conversation?

616
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:36,609
I mean the nature of you.

617
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:47,240
You can have the money, Anton.

618
01:24:26,551 --> 01:24:27,863
<i>Hello?</i>

619
01:24:27,898 --> 01:24:29,176
Yes?

620
01:24:32,136 --> 01:24:33,925
<i>Is Carson Wells there?</i>

621
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,426
Not in the sense that you mean.

622
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,785
<i>You need to come see me.</i>

623
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,675
Who is this?

624
01:24:45,176 --> 01:24:46,635
You know who it is.

625
01:24:47,927 --> 01:24:49,832
You need to talk to me.

626
01:24:50,074 --> 01:24:51,340
<i>I don't need to talk to you.</i>

627
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:52,607
I think you do.

628
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,760
Do you know where I'm going?

629
01:24:56,114 --> 01:24:58,293
Why would I care where you're going.

630
01:24:58,328 --> 01:25:00,332
I know where you are.

631
01:25:00,853 --> 01:25:02,887
<i>Yeah? Where am I?</i>

632
01:25:02,922 --> 01:25:04,961
You're in a hospital across the river.

633
01:25:04,996 --> 01:25:09,949
But that's not where I'm going.
Do you know where I'm going?

634
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:13,911
<i>Yeah. I know where you're going.</i>

635
01:25:13,946 --> 01:25:15,521
Alright.

636
01:25:16,179 --> 01:25:18,022
<i>You know she won't be there. </i>

637
01:25:18,057 --> 01:25:20,237
It doesn't make any difference where she is.

638
01:25:20,272 --> 01:25:22,146
So what're you goin up there for?

639
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,823
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?

640
01:25:30,618 --> 01:25:31,873
No.

641
01:25:32,996 --> 01:25:36,771
I think you do too.
So this is what I'll offer.

642
01:25:37,616 --> 01:25:40,069
You bring me the money and I'll let her go.

643
01:25:41,038 --> 01:25:44,834
<i>Otherwise she's accountable.
Same as you.</i>

644
01:25:47,015 --> 01:25:49,364
That's the best deal you're going to get.

645
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:53,607
I won't tell you you can save yourself
because you can't.

646
01:25:56,764 --> 01:25:58,933
Yeah, I'm goin to bring you somethin' alright.

647
01:26:00,178 --> 01:26:02,669
I've decided to make you a special
project of mine.

648
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:04,662
You ain't goin' to have to come
look for me at all.

649
01:26:09,544 --> 01:26:11,558
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yessir.

650
01:26:12,053 --> 01:26:14,084
None of the three had ID on 'em,...

651
01:26:14,119 --> 01:26:15,948
...but they're tellin me that all three is Mexicans.

652
01:26:16,623 --> 01:26:17,453
Was Mexicans.

653
01:26:17,617 --> 01:26:22,402
There's a question.  Whether they 
stopped it? And when?

654
01:26:24,383 --> 01:26:25,933
Yessir.

655
01:26:26,573 --> 01:26:29,015
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about 
the lock cylinder?

656
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,891
- Yessir. It was punched out.
- Okay.

657
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:34,364
You wanna drive out there?

658
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:38,416
No, that's all I've to look for and it sounds like 
these old boys died of natural causes.

659
01:26:38,791 --> 01:26:39,895
How's that, Sheriff?

660
01:26:39,896 --> 01:26:42,103
Natural to the line of work they was in. 

661
01:26:42,138 --> 01:26:43,136
Yessir.

662
01:26:43,171 --> 01:26:46,953
My god, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I can't 
think of any other word for it.

663
01:26:46,988 --> 01:26:49,182
Who are these people?

664
01:26:49,432 --> 01:26:52,019
Here last week they found this couple out...

665
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:54,606
...in California, they'd rent out 
rooms to old people.

666
01:26:54,641 --> 01:26:59,265
Kill em, bury em in the yard and cash their 
social security checks. 

667
01:27:00,058 --> 01:27:03,730
They'd torture them first. 
I don't know why.

668
01:27:04,573 --> 01:27:07,058
Maybe their television set was broke.

669
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:09,906
And this went on until, and here I quote:

670
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:16,057
<i>Neighbors were alerted when a man ran 
from the premises wearing only a dog collar.</i>

671
01:27:17,776 --> 01:27:21,354
You can't make up such a thing as that. 
I dare you to even try.

672
01:27:21,389 --> 01:27:24,656
But that's what it took, you'll notice. 
Get somebody's attention.

673
01:27:24,691 --> 01:27:27,923
Diggin graves in the back yard 
didn't bring any.

674
01:27:34,989 --> 01:27:37,457
That's all right. I laugh 
myself sometimes. 

675
01:27:39,967 --> 01:27:42,362
There ain't a whole lot else you can do.

676
01:27:44,849 --> 01:27:46,144
Tell me something.

677
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:49,431
Who do you think gets through this gate 
into the United States of America?

678
01:27:51,364 --> 01:27:53,913
I don't know. American citizens?

679
01:27:54,207 --> 01:27:56,569
Some American citizens. Who do 
you think decides?

680
01:27:56,801 --> 01:28:00,036
- Well, you do, I reckon.
- That is correct. How do I decide?

681
01:28:00,911 --> 01:28:02,798
- I don't know.
- I ask questions.

682
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:06,951
And if I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. 
If I don't get sensible answers they don't.

683
01:28:06,986 --> 01:28:08,986
- Anything about that you don't understand?
- No sir.

684
01:28:09,021 --> 01:28:11,832
Then I ask you again. How you come to be 
out here with no clothes?

685
01:28:13,272 --> 01:28:15,167
I got an overcoat on.

686
01:28:16,052 --> 01:28:17,849
- Are you jackin' with me?
- Oh, no sir.

687
01:28:17,884 --> 01:28:19,646
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes sir.

688
01:28:20,568 --> 01:28:22,821
- Are you in the service?
- No sir. I'm a veteran.

689
01:28:22,856 --> 01:28:25,241
- Nam?
- Yes sir. Two tours.

690
01:28:25,276 --> 01:28:26,454
What outfit?

691
01:28:26,489 --> 01:28:32,085
Twelfth Infantry Battalion. 
August 7th 1966 to July 2nd 1968.

692
01:28:34,207 --> 01:28:35,912
- Wilson!
- Yessir.

693
01:28:37,855 --> 01:28:40,620
Get someone to help this man. 
He needs to get into town.

694
01:28:49,805 --> 01:28:53,235
- How those Larries holdin' up?
- Oh, good.

695
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:56,037
- I need everything else.
- Okay.

696
01:28:57,183 --> 01:28:59,770
You have a lot of people come in here 
without any clothes on?

697
01:28:59,805 --> 01:29:02,161
No sir, it's unusual.

698
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:17,085
<i>She don't want to talk to you.</i>

699
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,451
Yes she does. Put her on.

700
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:19,897
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

701
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:22,564
I don't care what time it is. And
don't you hang up this phone. 

702
01:29:27,827 --> 01:29:29,607
- Llewelyn.
- Hey you.

703
01:29:29,874 --> 01:29:32,841
- What should I do ?
- You know what's goin' on?

704
01:29:33,096 --> 01:29:36,606
I don't know, I had the sheriff here 
from Terrell County.

705
01:29:36,641 --> 01:29:38,002
What did you tell him?

706
01:29:38,217 --> 01:29:42,499
<i>What did I know to tell him?
You're hurt, ain't you?</i>

707
01:29:44,205 --> 01:29:45,998
What makes you say that?

708
01:29:46,403 --> 01:29:47,900
<i>I can hear it in your voice.</i>

709
01:29:47,935 --> 01:29:50,091
<i>There is falseness in his voice!</i>

710
01:29:50,415 --> 01:29:53,070
Look, I want you to meet me at the 
Desert Sands motel in El Paso.

711
01:29:53,854 --> 01:29:56,319
Cause I'm gonna give you the money 
and I'ma put you on a plane.

712
01:29:56,354 --> 01:29:58,941
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.

713
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:02,881
No. This works better. With you gone and 
I don't have the money, he can't touch me.

714
01:30:02,916 --> 01:30:04,861
But I can sure touch him.

715
01:30:04,896 --> 01:30:07,320
And after I find him I'll 
come and join you.

716
01:30:07,601 --> 01:30:10,961
<i>Find who? What am I supposed 
to do with Mother?</i>

717
01:30:10,996 --> 01:30:13,152
- Nah, she'll be alright. 
- She'll be alright?

718
01:30:13,187 --> 01:30:15,706
<i>Be all right?! I've got the cancer!</i>

719
01:30:15,741 --> 01:30:18,246
Ain't nobody's gonna bother her. 

720
01:30:52,307 --> 01:30:53,525
Who are you?

721
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,969
- Me?
- Yes.

722
01:31:00,004 --> 01:31:03,507
Nobody. Accounting.

723
01:31:05,536 --> 01:31:08,224
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

724
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:15,785
He feels...he felt that...
the more people looking...

725
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:20,161
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.

726
01:31:21,496 --> 01:31:26,995
I see. Are you going 
to shoot me?

727
01:31:33,223 --> 01:31:39,317
That depends. 
Do you see me?

728
01:31:42,348 --> 01:31:44,807
I always seen this is what it would come to.

729
01:31:45,098 --> 01:31:47,381
Three years ago I pre-visioned it.

730
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:49,350
It ain't even three years we been married.

731
01:31:49,663 --> 01:31:53,770
Three years ago I said them 
very words. No and Good.

732
01:31:53,974 --> 01:31:58,239
Here we are.
Ninety degree heat.

733
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:02,505
I got the cancer. And look at this. 
Not even a home to go to. 

734
01:32:03,319 --> 01:32:09,271
We're goin' to El Paso Texas. You know how 
many people I know in El Paso Texas?

735
01:32:09,306 --> 01:32:12,631
- No ma'am.
- That's how many.

736
01:32:21,436 --> 01:32:24,538
- I didn't see my Prednizone.
- I put it in, Mama.

737
01:32:24,697 --> 01:32:28,026
- Well I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in. That one.

738
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,105
You just set there. I'll get tickets 
and a cart for the bags. 

739
01:32:32,512 --> 01:32:34,729
Do you need help with the bags, madam?

740
01:32:35,513 --> 01:32:38,417
Well, thank god there is one gentleman 
left in West Texas.

741
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:41,369
Yes, thank you. I am old 
and I am not well.

742
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:45,938
- Which bus are you taking?
- We're going to El Paso. Don't ask me why.

743
01:32:46,215 --> 01:32:48,889
It's not often you see a Mexican in a suit. 

744
01:32:49,191 --> 01:32:52,378
You go to El Paso? I know it. 
Where are you staying?

745
01:32:53,106 --> 01:32:54,792
<i>Carla Jean, how are you?</i>

746
01:32:55,013 --> 01:32:58,891
Sheriff, was that a true story about 
Charlie Walser?

747
01:32:59,091 --> 01:33:00,691
<i>Who's Charlie Walser?</i>

748
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:08,276
Oh! Oh, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail 
but it's certainly true that it is a story.

749
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:09,699
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

750
01:33:11,708 --> 01:33:13,732
Sheriff, can you give me 
your word on somethin'?

751
01:33:13,857 --> 01:33:15,887
<i>Yes ma'am?</i>

752
01:33:16,293 --> 01:33:18,996
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,...

753
01:33:18,997 --> 01:33:21,700
...you promise it'll be just you goes 
and talks with him?

754
01:33:22,454 --> 01:33:23,717
You and nobody else.

755
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:25,750
Yes ma'am, I do.

756
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:28,188
<i>Llewelyn would never ask for help.</i>

757
01:33:28,636 --> 01:33:30,731
He never thinks he needs any.

758
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:33,657
<i>Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.</i>

759
01:33:34,736 --> 01:33:38,326
<i>And he needs help, whether 
he knows it or not.</i>

760
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:49,024
What's the problem there, neighbor?

761
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:53,610
That'll suck some power. 
Over time.

762
01:33:55,525 --> 01:33:59,293
- You from around here?
- Alpine. Born and bred.

763
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:00,403
Here ya go.

764
01:34:00,964 --> 01:34:06,169
- What airport would you use?
- Well? Airport or airstrip?

765
01:34:06,372 --> 01:34:09,561
- Airport.
- Well, where ya goin'?

766
01:34:10,496 --> 01:34:13,901
- I don't know.
- Just lightin' out for the territories, huh?

767
01:34:14,589 --> 01:34:16,515
Brother, I been there.

768
01:34:17,009 --> 01:34:17,485
Well...

769
01:34:18,102 --> 01:34:21,525
There's airstrips.
The airport is El Paso.

770
01:34:22,434 --> 01:34:25,820
You want some place specific you might could 
be better off just drivin' to Dallas.

771
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:27,513
Not have to connect.

772
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:33,497
- You gonna clamp them, buddy?
- Can you get those chicken crates out of the bed?

773
01:34:34,596 --> 01:34:36,586
What're you talkin' about?

774
01:34:52,592 --> 01:34:57,459
- Hey. Mr. Sporting Goods.
- Hey yourself.

775
01:34:58,535 --> 01:34:59,291
You a sport?

776
01:35:00,584 --> 01:35:02,490
Yeah, that's me.

777
01:35:03,021 --> 01:35:04,876
I got beers in my room.

778
01:35:06,989 --> 01:35:08,908
Waiting on my wife.

779
01:35:09,749 --> 01:35:14,108
- That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
- Half.

780
01:35:14,143 --> 01:35:18,468
- What else then?
- Just lookin' for what's comin'.

781
01:35:19,938 --> 01:35:22,085
Yeah, but no one ever sees that.

782
01:35:23,127 --> 01:35:25,811
Beer. That's what's comin'.

783
01:35:26,531 --> 01:35:28,999
I'll bring the ice chest out here. 
You can stay married.

784
01:35:29,034 --> 01:35:31,500
No ma'am. I know what beer leads to.

785
01:35:33,468 --> 01:35:35,796
Beer leads to more beer.

786
01:36:29,137 --> 01:36:31,197
Call police.

787
01:36:37,105 --> 01:36:38,673
Your local law enforcement.

788
01:36:41,136 --> 01:36:42,313
I'm not on their radio.

789
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:35,709
Buy you a cup of coffee 
before you drive home?

790
01:37:36,303 --> 01:37:37,698
No money in his room there?

791
01:37:37,811 --> 01:37:42,326
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres 
would've taken the stash.

792
01:37:42,834 --> 01:37:46,929
I suppose so. Though they was 
leavin' in a hurry. 

793
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:50,070
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom.

794
01:37:50,415 --> 01:37:52,115
The money and the drugs.

795
01:37:53,319 --> 01:37:56,368
It's just goddamned beyond everything.

796
01:37:56,836 --> 01:37:59,695
What's it mean? 
What's it leading to?

797
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:04,835
You know, if you'd a told me twenty years 
ago, I'd see children walking...

798
01:38:04,836 --> 01:38:09,430
the streets of our Texas towns with green 
hair and bones in their noses.

799
01:38:10,243 --> 01:38:12,145
I just flat out wouldn't of believed you. 

800
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:16,312
Signs and wonders. But I think once 
you quit hearin' sir and ma'am,...

801
01:38:16,313 --> 01:38:18,212
...the rest is soon to follow.

802
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:22,990
Oh, it's the tide. 
It's the dismal tide.

803
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:25,647
- It is not the one thing.
- Not the one thing.

804
01:38:25,993 --> 01:38:27,772
None of that explains your man though.

805
01:38:28,899 --> 01:38:31,921
He's just a goddamn homicidal 
lunatic, Ed Tom.

806
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:35,336
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Yeah well, what would you call him?

807
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:39,304
I don't know. Sometimes I think 
he's pretty much a ghost.

808
01:38:39,339 --> 01:38:41,181
- He's real all right.
- Oh yeah?

809
01:38:41,388 --> 01:38:45,294
All that at the ???
 Motel. It's beyond everything. 

810
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,920
Yeah, he has some hard bark on him.

811
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:50,555
That don't hardly say it.

812
01:38:51,506 --> 01:38:53,407
He shoots the desk clerk one day.

813
01:38:53,408 --> 01:38:57,210
Walks right back in the next 
and shoots a retired army colonel.

814
01:38:57,919 --> 01:38:59,430
It's hard to believe. 

815
01:38:59,649 --> 01:39:02,521
Strolls right back into a crime scene.

816
01:39:02,899 --> 01:39:07,556
Who would do such a thing? 
How do you defend against it?

817
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,271
Good trip, Ed Tom.

818
01:39:11,272 --> 01:39:13,899
I'm sorry we couldn't help your boy.

819
01:42:46,023 --> 01:42:47,679
Min back!

820
01:42:47,971 --> 01:42:51,676
- How'd you know I was here?
- Who else'd be driving up your truck?

821
01:42:52,436 --> 01:42:54,092
- You heard it?
- How's that?

822
01:42:54,437 --> 01:43:00,387
- You heard what I'm - you havin fun with me?
- What give you that idea?

823
01:43:01,019 --> 01:43:04,206
- I seen one of the cats heard it.
- But - how'd you know it was my truck?

824
01:43:05,051 --> 01:43:07,925
I deduced it. When you walked in.

825
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:09,757
How many of those things you got now?

826
01:43:09,792 --> 01:43:12,103
Cats? I don't know. Several.

827
01:43:12,822 --> 01:43:15,074
Well, it depends on what you mean by got.

828
01:43:15,892 --> 01:43:19,708
Some of 'em are half-wild, and 
some of 'em are just outlaws. 

829
01:43:23,236 --> 01:43:26,040
How you been, Ellis?

830
01:43:26,041 --> 01:43:31,650
You lookin' at it. I got to say 
you lookin' older. 

831
01:43:31,856 --> 01:43:33,308
I am older.

832
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:36,817
Got a letter from your wife.

833
01:43:36,818 --> 01:43:41,494
She writes to me pretty regular, 
keep me up on the family news.

834
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:45,017
- Didn't know there was any.
- She told me you were quittin'. 

835
01:43:48,182 --> 01:43:50,883
- You want a cup?
- 'Preciate it.

836
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:00,275
How fresh is that coffee?

837
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:05,979
I generally make a fresh pot ever week 
even if there's some left over. 

838
01:44:08,247 --> 01:44:11,431
That man who shot you died in prison.

839
01:44:12,809 --> 01:44:14,400
In Angola. 
Yeah.

840
01:44:15,121 --> 01:44:17,369
What would you a done if 
he'd been released?

841
01:44:18,183 --> 01:44:22,797
I don't know. Nothin. 
Wouldn't be no point to it. 

842
01:44:23,432 --> 01:44:26,043
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.

843
01:44:26,078 --> 01:44:29,640
Well, all the time you spend 
tryin' to get back...

844
01:44:29,641 --> 01:44:33,203
...what's been took from you more 
is goin' out the door.

845
01:44:33,591 --> 01:44:37,368
After a while, you just have to try 
to get a tourniquet on it.

846
01:44:37,737 --> 01:44:41,542
Your granddaddy never asked me 
to sign on as a deputy.

847
01:44:44,496 --> 01:44:47,056
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.

848
01:44:47,496 --> 01:44:49,027
How come're you doin' that?

849
01:44:49,306 --> 01:44:50,854
I don't know.

850
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:55,966
 I feel overmatched.

851
01:44:59,829 --> 01:45:02,210
I always figured when I got older,...

852
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:07,329
...God would sort of come into 
my life in some way.

853
01:45:10,419 --> 01:45:11,871
He didn't.

854
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:17,265
I don't blame him.

855
01:45:19,362 --> 01:45:22,745
If I was him I'd have the same opinion 
about me that he does.

856
01:45:23,029 --> 01:45:25,140
You don't know what he thinks.

857
01:45:39,078 --> 01:45:43,192
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and 
badge over to the Rangers.

858
01:45:43,193 --> 01:45:44,193
Put up in a museum.

859
01:45:45,619 --> 01:45:49,353
Your daddy ever tell you how 
Uncle Mac come to his reward?

860
01:45:50,154 --> 01:45:53,838
Gunned down on his own porch 
over in Hudspeth County.

861
01:45:56,078 --> 01:46:00,642
Seven or eight of 'em come up to here.
Wantin' this and wantin' that.

862
01:46:01,247 --> 01:46:04,138
Uncle Mac went back in the house 
and got the shotgun,...

863
01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:07,030
They was way ahead of him.

864
01:46:08,183 --> 01:46:10,341
Shot him in the doorway.

865
01:46:10,808 --> 01:46:13,637
Aunt Ella came out and tried to stop the bleedin'.

866
01:46:13,672 --> 01:46:16,466
Uncle Mac all the while tryin' 
to get that shotgun.

867
01:46:17,152 --> 01:46:21,057
They just sat there on their 
horses watchin' him die.

868
01:46:22,682 --> 01:46:27,559
After a while, one of 'em says somethin in 
Injun and they all turned and left out.

869
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:35,653
Well, Uncle Mac knew the score 
even if Aunt Ella didn't. 

870
01:46:35,688 --> 01:46:38,057
Shot through the left lung.

871
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:43,245
And that was that. As they say.

872
01:46:46,344 --> 01:46:52,081
- When did he die?
- 1909.

873
01:46:52,328 --> 01:46:58,121
No, I mean was it right away or in 
the night or when was it?

874
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:02,018
I believe it's that night. She 
buried him the next mornin'.

875
01:47:02,626 --> 01:47:04,917
Diggin' in that hard old caliche. 

876
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:11,445
What you got ain't nothin new.

877
01:47:11,989 --> 01:47:14,987
This country is hard on people.

878
01:47:18,129 --> 01:47:20,863
You can't stop what's comin'.

879
01:47:22,207 --> 01:47:25,051
Ain't all waitin' on you.

880
01:47:27,197 --> 01:47:29,832
That's vanity.

881
01:48:29,885 --> 01:48:34,540
- I knew this wasn't done with.
- No.

882
01:48:35,230 --> 01:48:39,522
I ain't got the money.

883
01:48:39,523 --> 01:48:43,815
What little I had is long gone and 
there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

884
01:48:45,322 --> 01:48:49,667
I buried my mother today. 
I ain't paid for that neither. 

885
01:48:50,718 --> 01:48:53,042
I wouldn't worry about it.

886
01:48:55,291 --> 01:48:57,666
I need to sit down. 

887
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,791
You got no cause to hurt me.

888
01:49:15,151 --> 01:49:18,603
No. But I gave my word.

889
01:49:19,493 --> 01:49:23,605
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

890
01:49:26,218 --> 01:49:32,199
That don't make sense. You gave your 
word to my husband to kill me?

891
01:49:32,472 --> 01:49:35,764
Your husband had the 
opportunity to save you.

892
01:49:35,765 --> 01:49:39,057
Instead, he used you to try 
to save himself.

893
01:49:44,051 --> 01:49:49,907
Not like that. 
Not like you say.

894
01:49:55,357 --> 01:49:57,233
You don't have to do this.

895
01:49:57,578 --> 01:49:59,297
They'll always say the same thing.

896
01:50:01,139 --> 01:50:03,035
What did they say?

897
01:50:03,452 --> 01:50:06,608
They say you don't have to do this.

898
01:50:07,014 --> 01:50:08,544
You don't.

899
01:50:17,037 --> 01:50:19,202
This is the best I can do.

900
01:50:20,318 --> 01:50:21,921
Call it.

901
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:29,859
I knowed you was crazy when 
I saw you sittin' there.

902
01:50:31,703 --> 01:50:34,858
I knowed exactly what was in store for me.

903
01:50:35,359 --> 01:50:37,889
- Call it.
- No.

904
01:50:39,328 --> 01:50:41,328
I ain't gonna call it.

905
01:50:44,754 --> 01:50:48,919
- Call it.
- The coin don't have no say.

906
01:50:49,454 --> 01:50:51,731
It's just you.

907
01:50:54,109 --> 01:50:57,609
Well, I got here the same 
way the coin did.

908
01:52:39,939 --> 01:52:43,063
Mister, there's a bone stickin' out of your arm.

909
01:52:43,418 --> 01:52:45,297
I'm alright. Let me just sit 
here a minute.

910
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:48,529
There's an ambulance comin'. 
Man over yonder went to call.

911
01:52:48,764 --> 01:52:50,170
Alright.

912
01:52:50,827 --> 01:52:54,638
Are you all right? You got a 
bone stickin' out of your arm.

913
01:52:55,641 --> 01:52:57,951
What will you take for that shirt?

914
01:53:02,937 --> 01:53:05,778
Hell mister, I'll give you my shirt.

915
01:53:12,827 --> 01:53:15,608
Look at that fuckin' bone.

916
01:53:15,819 --> 01:53:17,732
Tie this for me.

917
01:53:17,982 --> 01:53:19,859
Just tie it.

918
01:53:38,253 --> 01:53:42,796
Hell mister. Look, I don't mind helping 
someone out. That's a lot of money.

919
01:53:42,831 --> 01:53:47,928
Take it. Take it and you 
didn't see me.

920
01:53:48,129 --> 01:53:49,626
I was already gone.

921
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,503
Yessir.

922
01:53:55,856 --> 01:53:59,219
- Part of that's mine.
- You still got your damn shirt.

923
01:53:59,254 --> 01:54:02,703
- That ain't what it was for. 
- Well maybe, but I'm still out a shirt.

924
01:54:24,029 --> 01:54:26,626
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- Okay.

925
01:54:26,832 --> 01:54:29,903
- What do you think?
- I can't plan your day.

926
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:33,342
I mean, would you care to join me?

927
01:54:33,687 --> 01:54:35,561
Lord no. I'm not retired.

928
01:54:37,343 --> 01:54:39,738
Maybe I'll help out here then.

929
01:54:40,622 --> 01:54:42,328
Better not.

930
01:54:46,062 --> 01:54:49,594
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

931
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:53,218
Well you got time for 'em now. 
Anything interesting?

932
01:54:53,937 --> 01:54:56,645
They always is to the 
party concerned. 

933
01:54:59,122 --> 01:55:01,981
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

934
01:55:05,186 --> 01:55:07,876
Okay. Two of 'em. Both 
had my father. It's peculiar.

935
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:13,280
I'm older now than he ever 
was by twenty years.

936
01:55:12,666 --> 01:55:16,522
So, in a sense he's the younger man.

937
01:55:17,091 --> 01:55:19,341
Anyway, first one I don't remember 
too well but...

938
01:55:19,342 --> 01:55:23,843
It was about meeting him in town someplace 
where he gave me some money.

939
01:55:24,842 --> 01:55:26,653
I think I lost it.

940
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:32,883
The second one, it was like we 
was both back in older times...

941
01:55:33,531 --> 01:55:37,375
...and I was on horseback goin'
through the mountains of a night. 

942
01:55:37,593 --> 01:55:40,905
Goin' through this pass in the mountains.

943
01:55:41,153 --> 01:55:49,812
It was cold and there's snow on the ground. He rode past me and 
kept on goin'. Never said nothin goin' by. He just rode on past.

944
01:55:51,404 --> 01:55:55,531
He had his blanket wrapped around 
him and his head down.

945
01:55:57,013 --> 01:55:59,027
When he rode past I seen he was...

946
01:55:59,028 --> 01:56:01,042
...carryin fire in a horn...

947
01:56:01,077 --> 01:56:05,417
...the way people used to do and I could see 
the horn from the light inside of it.

948
01:56:05,657 --> 01:56:07,420
About the color of the moon.

949
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:14,199
And in the dream I knew that 
he was goin' on ahead...

950
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:19,449
and that he's fixin to make a fire somewhere 
out there in all that dark and all that cold.

951
01:56:23,107 --> 01:56:27,657
I knew that whenever I got 
there he'd be there.

952
01:56:30,596 --> 01:56:31,707
Then, I woke up.

953
01:56:40,358 --> 01:56:44,420
