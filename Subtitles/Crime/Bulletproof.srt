00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,146
Nothing.

172
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,857
Just something Archie did. He's crazy.

173
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,527
Are you getting sweet on this guy?

174
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,822
- No.
- Let me tell you something.

175
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:17,994
You pal around with somebody long enough
you forget he's the bad guy.

176
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,329
(LAUGHING)

177
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,042
So why don't you tell me
about your damn self, Mr. Keats?

178
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,962
Well, the truth is, there ain't much to say.

179
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,631
I did some time up north
for breaking and entering,

180
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:33,384
a little armed robbery, petty shit like that.

181
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:37,805
What about references?
Do you trust this man, Moses?

182
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,391
Mr. Colton, I trust this guy with my life.

183
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,351
That's good.

184
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:47,148
I mean, because trust is
a very important commodity in business.

185
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:49,317
True that. True that!

186
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:51,736
True that.

187
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,196
And I want to tell you who I trust.

188
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,907
I trust Moses here.

189
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,743
Thank you.

190
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,663
And I trust my colleague, Mr. Bledsoe.

191
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:06,250
But most importantly, Mr. Keats,
I wanna tell you who I don't trust.

192
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,377
I don't trust you.

193
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,670
- Yo.
- Hey!

194
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,673
See, I don't trust you,
'cause, hell, I don't know you.

195
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:13,799
Mr. Colton...

196
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:15,009
Search him.

197
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,887
This is bullshit. He's my friend.
I don't wanna search him.

198
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,974
You search him, not 'cause you want to
but because you have to, you understand?

199
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:24,769
Jesus!

200
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,356
Mo, this is like some embarrassing shit, man.

201
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,358
I know this guy like I know myself.

202
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,777
If he's a cop, I'll suck your dick, Mr. Colton.

203
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,364
Jesus. I'm sorry, bro. See? No wires.

204
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,741
Well, hell, search him.

205
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,284
ARCHIE: Nothing.

206
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,791
Well, fine. If you don't ask, you never know.

207
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,667
You know what I'm saying?
You understand me?

208
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,378
Now, remember,

209
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:53,672
nobody moves until Jack gives us the word
that Colton is on the premises.

210
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,174
Understood?

211
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,134
- Listen, Cap.
- Yes, Jack.

212
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,762
I want to be the one to bring Archie in.

213
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:00,888
What?

214
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:03,432
There's gonna be a lot of testosterone
flying around here today.

215
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:06,894
I don't want none of these overzealous
assholes putting any dents in Archie.

216
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:10,314
I knew it. You are sweet on the son of a bitch.

217
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,817
Hey, look, I know him. He's not that bad...

218
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,070
- He's a low-life scumbag!
- Then he's my low-life scumbag.

219
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:20,199
And who knows? After this is over, maybe
I can help him get his life back together.

220
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,126
You look tense, man. Relax.
It's gonna be all right.

221
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,976
Relax. It's just a nice, little friendly doggy.

222
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,853
How you doing, buddy? Long time no see.

223
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,646
Oh, my God! You like that, huh?

224
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,398
He's licking me. He loves me.

225
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,527
No, he just licked his balls, and he's trying
to get that nasty taste out of his mouth.

226
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,534
Hey, <i>Ese,</i> don't shoot. It's me.

How you guys 010mg?

228
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,666
Colton didn't say nothing about no new guy.

229
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,879
All right. Rigo, meet Rock Keats.

Don't worry.
He's gonna be here to check up on my shit.

You better back up off me.

00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,234
Hey! Relax, man.

243
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,944
You better tell Tattoo here something.

244
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,196
This fucking maricén is making me nervous.

245
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,490
He acts like a cop.

246
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:09,868
He's not a cop!
He's my friend, so take it down.

247
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:10,995
I don't know that.

248
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,080
You think he's a cop? Is that what you think?

249
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,666
Well, god damn it, he's not a cop.
Take a look!

250
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,835
Satisfied, scumbag?

251
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,628
Fucking piece of shit!

252

- We move now.
- What about Colton?

253
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,675

If you come out now,
maybe we can make a deal.

Don't you talk to me about making any deals,
you lying sack of shit!

I'll blow this dog's head off his fucking body.

I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

"If he's a cop, I'll suck your dick."

I'm close to that particular quote, am I not?

290
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:41,371
I don't think I did say that, actually.
Maybe Bledsoe said that.

- He's rolling on Colton?
- Uh-huh.

338
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:42,362
Colton wasn't too thrilled with Moses
for bringing a cop into his organization.

He's had a hit on him ever since.

00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,123
Jack, Steve Finch, DEA.
He's calling the shots on this.

343
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,208
And what the hell is he getting out of this?

344
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,794
- Commuted sentence.
- How commuted?

345

Still to be determined.

- Take it easy.

telling me he's getting away with it!

Jack, that's not how it happened.

351
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,769
- Moses will do the time.
- You know what?

352
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,481
You and the DEA figure that shit out.
I don't want nothing to do with it.

What condition?

I don't know why he wants you
to bring him in, and I don't give a shit!

00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,581
- With him, we finish what we started.
- No.

You don't have to be afraid.
We'll send in a team for backup.

After the way you treated him,

I wouldn't be surprised
if he didn't want to put another bullet...

You're right, "Stench." I am afraid of Moses.

They say you're not the same man, Jack.

372

They say that when you got shot,
you lost a piece of yourself.

I didn't even know you then,
but do you know what I think?

it's making you miserable 8 hours a day,

and you pretend
that Archie Moses doesn't exist,

01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:59,624
- You're not gonna get mad?
- I ain't gonna get mad at you.

1031
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:01,917
I'm falling in love with you all over again.

1032
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:04,295
Okay.

1033
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:07,798
Colton's got Traci. He says the only way
I can get her back is if I turn you in.

1034
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:09,008
There. I said it.

1035
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:14,805
You can't stop fucking me over, can you?

1036
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:16,599
I'm not gonna turn you in.

1037
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:19,393
Okay? But I can't get her back without you.

1038
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:21,354
You're the only one that knows your way
around that place.

1039
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:25,775
We both know I ain't gonna make it
out of that place alive if I go there.

1040
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:27,652
- Look...
- Forget it, man.

1041
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:30,029
- I ain't doing this shit.
- Okay, fine.

1042
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:33,157
Then I guess you lied to me after all.

1043
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,825
Okay. About what?

1044
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:38,412
You said you would take a bullet for me.

1045
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:42,124
I would have taken a bullet for you
at one time,

1046
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:44,293
but that shit's all gone now.

1047
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:49,757
Cool. Then don't do it for me.

1048
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,175
Do it for yourself,

1049
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:54,261
because as long as you're alive,
Colton wants you dead.

1050
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:57,598
It's only a matter of time
before he puts your lights out.

1051

1052
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:03,938
All right. Give me a gun.

Moses, you're a fugitive who's in my custody.

1054
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:09,610
I can't just give you a gun.

1055
01:07:09,694 --> 01:07:12,613
- Even if it means I'm gonna get killed?
- It don't work like that.

1056
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:15,074
Even if it means Traci could get killed?

1057
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:18,869
Will you get over that black-and-white shit
and come over to the gray area?

1058
01:07:18,953 --> 01:07:20,788
God damn it! There's plenty of room.

1059
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:38,013
- I think Mr. Colton's waiting to see us.
- He certainly is.

1060
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,433
Hand it over.

1061
01:07:43,978 --> 01:07:45,146
After you.

1062
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:10,045

Bet you're glad you gave me that gun.

1063

This is the only door without an alarm.

1064
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:18,345
- Where does it lead to?
- Guest kitchen. Nobody's ever in there.

1072
01:09:19,824 --> 01:09:21,033

1081
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,766
I saw him drive off when the shooting started.

Give me the gun.

1088

Colton knew you'd be coming after me
sooner or later,

01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:27,803
so he sicced devil eyes over here on you
