345
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:26,055
Sir, I regret to inform you
that a body was found last night.

346
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:31,890
Upon investigation, we believe it to be
the remains of your son, Michael Deerfield.

347
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,493
Right. They'll need me
to identify the body?

No, sir. We've--

349
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,999
They've determined identity in other ways.
I believe partial fingerprints.

-I wanna see his body now!

Sergeant Deerfield, this isn't necessary.

354
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,780
Maybe not...

355
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:27,190
...but it's the way he left this earth,
so I don't see as I have any choice.

356
00:28:34,095 --> 00:28:36,654
EXAMINER: Working backwards,
carbon patterns show the body...

357
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,723
...was dismembered
before it was burned.

358
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:42,293
It appears a large knife or tool
was used, but the blade was dull...

359
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,463
...which is why the bones are
shattered rather than severed.

360
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,366
Burn patterns show us
the dismembered parts were stacked...

361
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:52,003
...and doused with an accelerant in
an attempt to incinerate the body.

362
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:55,340
You'd need an oven
to approach an effective temperature...

363
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,176
...which means most tissue
would've been left intact.

364
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:01,713
So the damage is largely the result
of scavengers stripping the bones.

365
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:04,315
Cause of death will take
more time to determine...

366
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,518

trying to smuggle heroin in from Kuwait.

398

There were two great armies assembled,

that the king had were all too scared.

So the king dresses David
in his own armor.

But it's much too big and heavy,
so David takes it off and he looks around...

...and he finds five smooth stones
about that big.

And he steps out into the valley,
with his slingshot in his hand.

01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:03,742
I figured somebody should.

850
01:09:03,752 --> 01:09:06,745
It must be frustrating being
such a damn good investigator...

851
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:11,083
...surrounded by incompetent fools.
Remind me, what is it you do in Munro?

852
01:09:11,093 --> 01:09:13,089

01:09:13,099 --> 01:09:14,253
That's a shame.

been solved if you'd been on the job.

855
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:21,927
This goes to trial, the defense
will say you poisoned the well.

856

-It won't go to trial.
-What?

857

-It wasn't them.
-I'm sorry?

being with him, but they didn't do it.

-They were fighting in the parking lot.
-Blowing off steam.

You have not been to war

what happened?

870
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:23,155
We were at this strip club.

871
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:28,193
Just hanging out, having a good time.
We were drinking, of course.

872
01:10:28,203 --> 01:10:31,263
And Mike starts acting really weird.

873
01:10:31,406 --> 01:10:33,799
Really angry,
throwing change at the stripper.

874
01:10:33,809 --> 01:10:35,567
Then he started talking trash...

875
01:10:35,577 --> 01:10:39,371
...so she started talking trash,
and they tossed us out.

876
01:10:39,381 --> 01:10:41,106
And we're getting in the car...

877
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:43,876
...and Bonner's all pissed
saying Mike can walk.

878
01:10:43,886 --> 01:10:46,912
So Mike grabs him and they just
start going off on each other.

879

But it's the kind of shit
that happens all the time.

Nobody got hurt.

882
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:56,989
So we got in the car,
we drove around for a while.

883
01:10:56,999 --> 01:11:00,225
And then we stopped at the Chicken Shack,
across from the base.

884
01:11:00,235 --> 01:11:03,128
Mike bought, for getting us kicked out.

885

-And what time was this?
-I don't know.

01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:08,934
Around 1.

887
01:11:08,944 --> 01:11:11,378

01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:19,077
No.

01:11:19,087 --> 01:11:21,087
Just the three of us.

01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:25,450
Why would you leave him there?

892
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,460
Because we were wasted.

893
01:11:27,596 --> 01:11:31,456
We had had enough,
but Mike wanted to find some meth.

894
01:11:31,466 --> 01:11:32,791

898
01:11:40,108 --> 01:11:43,101
He went looking for drugs,
ran into the wrong people?

899
01:11:43,111 --> 01:11:45,637
Who knows?
I mean, Mike always had secrets.

900
01:11:45,647 --> 01:11:49,908
You know, over there,
he was always sneaking off by himself.

901

too well with people.

Ahem. We found a hooker
over on Ten Mile Road.

910
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:22,422
She blew all four of us.

911
01:12:23,518 --> 01:12:25,978
Why didn't you say that
when you were questioned?

912
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:28,347
We didn't think Mike
wanted his parents to know.

913
01:12:28,357 --> 01:12:30,949
SANDERS: You didn't want his father
to know he got a blow job?

914

And was buying drugs. I wouldn't
want somebody telling my parents.

915

So, what was the fight about?

916
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,727
Mike was in some dark mood.
I don't know why.

917
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:45,330
And then he started saying
nasty things to that stripper.

01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:46,698
Like what?

01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:50,936

a stripper, not something on your shoe.

said Mike came at you swinging.

That you had a knife?
