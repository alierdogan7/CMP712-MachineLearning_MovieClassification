You've gone and left my heart in pain #</i>

692
01:33:15,863 --> 01:33:19,890
<i># All you left
is our favorite song #</i>

693
01:33:19,967 --> 01:33:23,527
<i># The one we danced to
all night long #</i>

694
01:33:23,603 --> 01:33:27,539
<i># It used to bring
sweet memories #</i>

695
01:33:27,607 --> 01:33:31,134
<i># Of a tender love
that used to be #</i>

696
01:33:31,211 --> 01:33:34,612
<i># Now it's the same old song #</i>

697
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:38,913
<i># But with a different meaning
since you been gone #</i>

698
01:33:38,984 --> 01:33:42,317
<i># Now it's the same old song #</i>

699
01:33:42,388 --> 01:33:47,086
<i># But with a different meaning
since you been gone #</i>

700
01:33:47,158 --> 01:33:50,286
<i># Ah, oh, ah #</i>

701
01:33:50,361 --> 01:33:54,092
<i># Sentimental fool am I #</i>

702
01:33:54,165 --> 01:33:57,965
<i># To hear an old love song
and wanna cry #</i>

703
01:33:58,036 --> 01:34:02,028
<i># But the melody
keeps haunting me #</i>

704
01:34:02,105 --> 01:34:05,438
<i># Reminding me how
in love we used to be #</i>

705
01:34:05,509 --> 01:34:09,410
<i># Keep hearing the part
that used to touch our hearts #</i>

706
01:34:09,478 --> 01:34:13,471
<i>###Saying, together forever
Breaking up never ###</i>

707
01:34:13,549 --> 01:34:17,246
<i># It's the same old song #</i>

708
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:21,416
<i># But with a different meaning
since you been gone #</i>

709
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:24,617
<i># It's the same old song #</i>

710
01:34:24,693 --> 01:34:29,220
<i># But with a different meaning
since you been gone #</i>

711
01:34:29,297 --> 01:34:35,166
<i># [Instrumental Break]</i>

712
01:34:48,114 --> 01:34:50,810
<i># We used to dance
to the music #</i>

713
01:34:50,883 --> 01:34:55,512
<i># Make romance to the music #</i>

714
01:34:55,588 --> 01:34:59,454
<i># Now it's the same old song #</i>

715
01:34:59,524 --> 01:35:03,153

718
01:35:10,568 --> 01:35:15,004
<i># I, oh, I
Can't bear to hear it #</i>

719
01:35:15,071 --> 01:35:18,530
<i># It's the same old song #</i>

720
01:35:18,609 --> 01:35:22,840
<i># But with a different meaning
since you been gone #</i>

721
