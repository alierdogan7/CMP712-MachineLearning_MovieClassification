01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,531
Hi, Alison.

1234
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,181
Hey, Jerry?

1235
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,474
JERRY: Yeah?

1236
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:43,809
BOSCO: You remember last week

1237
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,520
when you said
there was an invisible line

1238
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,314
that separates good from evil,
and you thought you'd crossed it.

1239
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,358
And I said,
"No, no, no, no, no! You're a good boy!"

1240
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,859
Yeah, I remember. So what?

1241
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,435
I've changed my opinion.

1242
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,323
So you think I'm evil, Bosco?

1243
01:17:58,423 --> 01:17:59,857
I'm certain of it.

1244
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,123
Welcome to my world, Jerry!

1245
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,250
I don't wanna be a part of your world.

1246

JERRY: Fiona?

1249
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,999
What do you think I should do?

1250
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:21,471
Well, you can't go back to work,

1251
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,880
can't stay here, either.

1252
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:27,853
I think it's time to see if the cat knows
what he's talking about.

1253
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,146
She's right.

1254
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:30,355
I totally agree.

1255
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:32,566
Well, meow to that.

1256
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,193

I like people.

1257
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:38,030
Aye. Fuck the dog.

- Yes.

I'm so bloody...

1271
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,182
- Of course.
- He's so sexy when he's dark.

just by looking at him?

01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:15,933
Shut up!

Hi.

1280
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:36,630
I got a lot going on right now.

1281
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,924
What happened?

1282
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:42,376
Well, uh, I've been crying a lot.

1283
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:46,556
All the time.
And I stopped taking the drugs.

1284
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:48,340
What? Why?

1285
01:19:49,242 --> 01:19:50,801
The cat made me do it.

1286
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:53,730
Your cat made you?

1287
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:56,108
Mmm-hmm. No, no, kind of.

1288
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:59,184
I mean, Mr. Whiskers
does the talking, but it's really me.

1289
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,613
See? I'm making progress.

1290
01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,490
It's not the cat! I know that now.

1291
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,951
Jerry, we had an agreement.

1292
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,526
I know. I'm sorry.

1293
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:11,289
Dr. Warren! I'm a bad person.

1294
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,532
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1295
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:16,744
I appreciate your honesty.

1296
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:19,965
I'm disappointed,

1297
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:23,000
but hey, it's not like
you killed someone.

1298
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,461
Um...

1299
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,931
What, Jerry?

1300
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,965
It is kind of like that.

1301
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,385
Kind of like that times three.

1302
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,390
What are you saying, Jerry?

aren't alive anymore because of me.

Oh, my God.

1305
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,273
Yeah. I know.

1306
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,286
I feel terrible about it.

1307
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,998
And I really need your help right now.

1308
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:54,207
I'll help you, Jerry.

1309
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:55,375
Thank you.

1310
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,618
Go ahead. I'm listening.

1311
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,998
Okay. You know the conga line?

1312
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,011
At your company party. Yeah.

1313
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,503
Yeah.

Everybody sang A Happy Song.

1315
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:17,147
And you know that English girl, Fiona,
we conga-ed

1316
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,316
and we were supposed to go to Shi Shan,

1317
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,392
see an awesome show and...

1318
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:24,738
What are you doing, Doctor Warren?
Give me that.

1319
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,656
- DR. WARREN: No!
- Sorry, wrong number!

1320
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:28,950
- Help me! I'm being held hostage.
- JERRY: It was an accident!

1321
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,620
I liked all of them
and wish they were all alive.

1322
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,246
But there's nothing
that I can do about that now.

1323
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:34,831
Wait, do you have packing tape?

1324
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:36,124
What? Why?

1325
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:37,334
Because I can't let you go.

1326
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,535
And I still need a lot of therapy.

1327
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:44,883
No! Stay there!
You stay there now! Back! Back!

1328
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,220
Jerry, you're really upset right now.
Let's discuss this.

1329
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,262
JERRY: Okay.

1330
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:50,764
Stay calm. I understand.

1331
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,924
- Jerry, don't do this. Don't do this, Jerry. No.
- (JERRY SHUSHING)

1332
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,906
JERRY:
Okay. We haven't got a lot of time,

1333
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,565
so we gotta get into the big issues.

1334
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,150
Do you believe in God?

1335
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,285
Mmm.

1336
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:15,038
Me too. But I totally think
that he has it out for me.

1337
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:17,415
He cuts everyone else slack
and then totally craps all over me,

1338
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,793
and I wanna know why.

1339
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,838
Why would he put a little boy
in a home with a father like that?

1340
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:26,081
Make my mother lose herself so completely
that she'd rather die than be with me?

1341
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:32,097
But if he is all-knowing,
God must be okay with me killing people.

Good, if I un-tape you, we're going get on
the fast road to mental health, okay?

1346
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:44,558
Hey, you start doing the silent shrink thing
and I can't predict what I'll do.

1347
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:47,186
Oh.

1348
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,396
Now, why do I hear voices?

1349
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:51,950
Oh.

1350
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,828
A lot of people hear voices.

1351
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,780
Or thoughts they can't stop.

1352
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,115
- A lot of people?
- Yeah.

1353
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:02,002
It might be a voice

1354
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:05,338
telling them
they're worthless or stupid.

1355
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:09,426
Or it could tell them
to indulge every desire.

1356
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,219
"Drink that drink." "Take that drug."

1357
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:12,804
"Follow every sexual impulse."

1358
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:14,806
Or it could be a cynical voice

1359
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,349
telling them nothing matters,

1360
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,602
that their efforts are insignificant.

1361
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:20,344
You hear stuff like that?

1362
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,565
Yeah. I have thoughts.

1363
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:24,983
Not exactly the same as you,

1364
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,777
but similar.

1365
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:29,821
They tell me that I'm fat,

1366
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:34,409
or psychotherapy is not
a worthwhile exercise.

1367
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:35,994
That it's not real.

1368
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:39,164
That I should have aimed higher
than a government job,

1369
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,949
that my potential is being squandered,

1370
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,701
that I'm unworthy of love.

1371
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,540
But none of that is true.
So what do you do about it?

1372
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:54,721
Well, I can't shut them off entirely,

1373
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:56,514
nor would I want to,

1374
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:59,100
but I can argue against them.

1375
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,477
Just because you have thoughts,

1376
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:02,886
doesn't mean you have to act on them.

1377
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,891
You don't have to act on them?

1378
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,310
No!

1379
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:14,074
Being alone in the world

1380
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:16,400
is the root of all suffering.

1381
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:20,779

No, no, no.

You go inside,
I'll wait here and watch the road.

I can honk the horn

1391

can run back immediately.
