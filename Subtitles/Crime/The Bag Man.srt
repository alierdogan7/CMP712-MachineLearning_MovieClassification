1
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:58,747
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

2
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:02,019
I mean, if you want
me to protect this,

3
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,954
don't you want me
to know what it is?

4
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:05,389
- No, I don't.
- Okay.

5
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,257
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

6
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:10,994
In all due respect, why don't
you just hire the FedEx?

7
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:13,028
Because I'm hiring you, Jack.

8
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,335
You want me to pick up this bag and
bring it to you, and that's it?

9
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,838
I want to pay you an
exorbitant amount of money

10
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:24,540
to get the bag and bring it to me.

11
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:32,983
I don't get it. Why me?

12
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:35,351
Jesus Christ. Look.

13
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:43,659
This is me.

14
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:46,195
This is you.

15
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:48,063
This is the money.

16
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,468
This is the bag.

17
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,706
You go and get the bag.

18
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:57,307
And now, Jack,
this is vitally important.

19
00:01:57,308 --> 00:02:01,044
You do not look in this bag.
You do not open this bag.

20
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:04,247
You don't even take a
little peek in this bag.

21
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:07,349
The contents of this
bag are off-limits.

22
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:08,752
Understood?

23
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,120
Okay, I get it.

24
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:13,489
And you bring this bag to me.

25
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:19,194
And I give you the money.

26
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,365
Clear?

27
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,871
Yeah, hello.

28
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:36,006
How'd it go?

29
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,341
Your man, Bishop, tried to kill me.

30
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:39,976
Regardless, we stick to the plan.

31
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:41,311
<i>What do you mean,
"We stick to the plan"?</i>

32
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:43,380
I'm telling you your
man tried to whack me

33
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,548
and you're telling me
you still want me to go

34
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,550
to this shitty motel in
the middle of nowhere

35
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:48,118
and sit around and wait
for you all night?

36
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,086
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

37
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:51,521
How do I know there's not somebody
else waiting for me at the motel?

38
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,889
Jack, calm down.

39
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,026
I'm calm... I'm calling
you from a payphone

40
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,362
because he shot the fucking
cell phone out of my hand.

41
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,997
He put a fucking
bullet in my hand...

42
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:03,166
<i>You didn't look in the bag, did you?</i>

43
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,968
No, I didn't look in the bag.

44
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,436
You stick to the plan.

45
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:08,538
Yes. We stick to the plan.
<i>Room 13.</i>

46
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,372
Room 13.

47
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,745
Bishop, let's go.

48
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,955
You couldn't stick to
the plan, could you?

49
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,456
No! You shoot a guy in the hand.

50
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:52,681
Come on.

51
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,235
Can I help you?

52
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:21,403
Yeah. I need a room, please.

53
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:22,771
Okay.

54
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:24,708
How long you'll be staying?

55
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,376
One night.

56
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:28,043
Just for one night? Okay.
Yeah.

57
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:32,814
I'll need you to fill this out.

58
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,817
And I need to see a credit card.

59
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,754
I'll be paying in cash.

60
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:40,023
Excuse me?

61
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,957
I said, "I'll be paying in cash."

62
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,725
Okay.

63
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:47,396
I need you to fill out this card

64
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:51,533
and that'll be $65 plus tax.

65
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:54,469
What happened?

66
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,273
- What?
- Your hand is bleeding.

67
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,209
Oh.

68
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,244
I got into a fight with my wife.

69
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:03,246
She stabbed me with a steak knife.
She lunged at me.

70
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:06,182
Maybe you should go to a
hospital and get that looked at.

71
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:07,417
No, I'm fine.

72
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:08,752
I can call 'em if you'd like.

73
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:11,086
No, it's all right.
That's not necessary.

74
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,489
- It could be infected.
- It's not.

75
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,592
Might be infected
and not even know.

76
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:17,926
I said, "It's fine."
Please.

77
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,735
Fill out this card.

78
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,073
And this one, too.
Both of them.

79
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:34,044
- You're Bob Smith.
- Yeah.

80
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:35,811
- From Pittsburgh?
- Mmm-hmm.

81
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:39,481
You're gonna be in room number 6.

82
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:44,154
I want room 13, please.

83
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:45,887
- 13?
- Yeah.

84
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,695
Not many people ask for room 13.

85
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:55,498
So it's available, yeah?

86
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:57,267
Was you asked to ask
for that number?

87
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,302
Asked to ask?

88
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,136
- Were you?
- I'm asking you.

89
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,372
Room 13.

90
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:07,028
It's my lucky number.
I'm a contrarian, you know?

91
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:11,813
You're either a
contrarian or you're a victim.

92
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:14,651
You'll be in room number 13.

93
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:16,419
That's not an interconnecting room.

94
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,821
Interconnecting?

95
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:19,489
You can't go from one
room to the next

96
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,091
without going outside of the door.

97
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:23,259
Is that all right with you?
I don't give a fuck.

98
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,629
All right! You'll be in room number 13.
You can drive on down there.

99
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,096
Park by it if you'd like.

100
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,123
Hey!

101
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,926
Excuse me.

102
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:18,942
The phone in my room is dead.

103
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:20,343
The line is dead.

104
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:21,977
Oh, that's

105
00:10:22,512 --> 00:10:24,746
because it's not turned on.

106
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,716
Could you turn it on, please?

107
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,986
Well, in order for me
to turn on the phone

108
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:31,854
or any incidentals,

109
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:34,990
I'll need an impression
of a major credit card.

110
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,893
I'll give you cash.

111
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:41,196
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
need to see a credit card.

112
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:46,436
I just told you I'll
give you some cash.

113
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,839
If you want to let me charge
you for the telephone calls

114
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,240
I'm going to need to
get an impression

115
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:54,844
of a credit card.

116
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:59,014
Even if you wanted
to get extra towels,

117
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,417
I'm going to need to see that card.

118
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:03,552
I don't have a credit card.

119
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:07,055
Here's another $100.

120
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:10,859
That's $400 cash.

121
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:21,904
Here's another.
Here's another $100.

122
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,207
Turn the phone on for me?

123
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:28,344
I can take the cash.

124
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:30,280
Okay.

125
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:32,747
Seeing as that you don't
have a credit card.

126
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:37,487
And if you can just wait a minute,

127
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,457
I will write you a receipt and
then I can turn on the phone.

128
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,693
You let me know if there's
any trouble with the line

129
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:45,895
because we just had
some work done on it.

130
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:48,431
I don't know why.
It seemed okay to me.

131
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:51,700
They said otherwise the whole
place could go up in smoke.

132
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:55,438
That's what they said.

133
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:57,707
- Your hand feeling any better?
- Yes.

134
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,174
That's good.

135
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:04,447
Is there anything else that I can
do to help you this evening?

136
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:05,814
No.

137
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:10,652
Have a good night.

138
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,393
Hey, man.

139
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:18,727
Got a match?

140
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:21,597
No.

141
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:23,066
Why not?

142
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,266
Why don't you have a match?

143
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:43,652
Hello?

144
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:47,789
Yes.

145
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:51,026
That's fine.

146
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:54,929
Yeah, that's fine. I'll be waiting.

147
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,471
Sorry to bother you.
I was wondering

148
00:13:35,472 --> 00:13:37,252
if you had a corkscrew
I could borrow.

149
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:39,240
No.

150
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,310
Sorry to disturb you.

151
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,206
I said, "Wait here,
bitch, till I get back."

152
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,941
How long are we going
to stay in this place?

153
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,776
Until I do what I got to do!

154
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,111
I don't wanna be a part of this.

155
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:25,914
Shut your mouth and get your ass in
there. I said I got business. Now, go!

156
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:01,377
To tell you the truth, Janet,

157
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:03,813
I'm more annoyed at
myself than I am at you.

158
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,283
I like to think of myself
as being a reasonably savvy

159
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:10,886
person who can appraise the
value, the fabric if you will,

160
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:13,288
of the people who work for me.

161
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:14,724
Jesus Christ!

162
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:18,227
You'd think I'd have a goddamn
notepad in this office, wouldn't ya?

163
00:17:18,228 --> 00:17:20,395
Dragna, it was a mistake.

164
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:25,635
You know something?
I don't like surprises. I never did.

165
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:29,271
I never really enjoyed that
whole <i>Pop Goes The Wease</i> lthing.

166
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:31,674
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I appreciate the unexpected.

167
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,176
And, in fact, I'd say I'm a
connoisseur of the unexpected.

168
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:36,345
But I don't like surprises.

169
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,606
Do you understand the
distinction I'm making here?

170
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:40,750
Yes.

171
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:43,018
But I don't think you understand
what I'm saying. I don't...

172
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,152
Oh!

173
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:46,722
Eureka!

174
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:49,158
Dragna, I'm not a currency trader.

175
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,227
You asked me to sit
in front of the screen

176
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:53,328
because Melinda was
out with the flu.

177
00:17:55,765 --> 00:18:01,170
Do you know how hard it is to get
a mole in the Bank of Japan?

178
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:03,305
Even the yakuza couldn't do it.
And you know why?

179
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:05,406
Because they're savages.

180
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:08,343
- I can't find a pen in this office.
- Everybody was yelling.

181
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:12,380
I got confused. I pressed the buy
button instead of the sell button.

182
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:18,988
Just before the Bank of
Japan flooded the market

183
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:21,622
with Yen to weaken their currency.

184
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,025
Hmm.

185
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,761
The name I just wrote,

186
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,229
go see that guy.

187
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,297
He's the best plastic
surgeon in New York.

188
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:37,099
And you could pick
any nose you want.

189
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,934
Your old one.

190
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:41,337
Audrey Hepburn,
Beyonce, Barbra Streisand.

191
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:43,337
Whatever the hell you want.

192
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:46,074
My plane's here so I'm off.

193
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:50,578
Janet, no more surprises, okay?

194
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:15,564
Hi. Could I stay here for a while?
Please! Just until they leave.

195
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,764
Get up.

196
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:19,267
I said, "Get up"!

197
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:21,971
Please, I can't go out there.

198
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:23,606
- Get out.
- He's crazy. He'll kill me.

199
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,040
Are you deaf? Get out!

200
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,221
They're out of their minds.
Him and that midget.

201
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:29,311
Move. Move.

202
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:31,614
Please, mister,
I can't go out there.

203
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:33,714
They're going to fucking kill me.
Please.

204
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:37,685
What if I told them
what's under your bed?

205
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:40,589
What did you say?

206
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,791
What if I told them
what's under your bed?

207
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:00,910
Did you look in that bag?

208
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:02,278
No, I did not.

209
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,445
Bullshit! What do you want?

210
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:08,651
I just want to stay here
until they leave, okay?

211
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:10,851
Who do you work for?

212
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:15,057
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You think I'm stupid?

213
00:22:20,562 --> 00:22:21,729
Hello?

214
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:24,232
Hold on a minute.

215
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:27,768
Get up. Go in the bathroom.

216
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:30,871
Okay. Look, I'm going.

217
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:36,278
Hello?

218
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,681
<i>So you're still in room 13?</i>

219
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:40,482
Listen, Dragna, I just wasted
two more of your guys.

220
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:43,452
- Why do you think they were my guys?
<i>- Feds on the payroll maybe.</i>

221
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:45,621
They were the only wine
connoisseurs within 100 miles

222
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:47,556
and what were they doing up my ass?

223
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:49,291
Seems like you should be on Prozac.

224
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,126
<i>No, I don't need Prozac.</i>

225
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:52,294
Or AndroGel.

226
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:53,661
<i>I need my goddamn money.</i>

227
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:57,531
I need my goddamn
money right now.

228
00:22:58,233 --> 00:22:59,854
I need what you owe me.

229
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:01,869
Hello?

230
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:15,316
You could knock, you know?

231
00:23:17,753 --> 00:23:19,720
Thank you.

232
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:43,844
Could I have a shot of that?

233
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:46,514
No.

234
00:23:49,184 --> 00:23:50,686
So what are you going to do?

235
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:52,154
About what?

236
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:54,189
Sounds like you're in trouble.

237
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,325
Maybe I can help.

238
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:58,559
Go sit down over there.

239
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:03,599
Well, anyway, I just want to thank
you for letting me stay here.

240
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,136
Hey. I'm not doing you
any favors, okay?

241
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:09,138
You're staying in here 'cause you
put your nose in my business

242
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:11,073
where it does not belong.

243
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,109
And now I don't want you leaving
until I leave this place.

244
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,778
Do you understand?

245
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:17,513
What the fuck were you
doing coming in here

246
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:19,415
looking through my shit anyway?

247
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,583
I didn't come in here to
look through your shit.

248
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:24,153
Well, what were you
doing in here, then?

249
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:25,587
I told you.

250
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:28,090
He was going to kill me.

251
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,591
Well, that's not my problem.

252
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:32,493
I know it's my problem. I'm sorry.

253
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:40,235
To be truthful, I did look
inside your briefcase.

254
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:41,437
What the fuck?

255
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,138
There was only an envelope.
Okay.

256
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:44,672
Get it out! Show me!

257
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:18,173
Did you look inside this bag?

258
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:20,209
No, I told you already.

259
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,810
- Did you look inside this bag?
- No.

260
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:28,149
Why the fuck should I believe you?

261
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:37,658
Are you all right?

262
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:40,395
I can help you if you want.

263
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:42,430
Get out, bitch!

264
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:44,566
Bring your ass out here!

265
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:45,868
You fucking skank!

266
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:47,803
Where are you?

267
00:25:47,804 --> 00:25:50,671
I'm not playing these
games with you.

268
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:55,444
- What happened?
- I got shot.

269
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:57,446
- In the hand?
- Yeah.

270
00:25:57,447 --> 00:26:00,149
Why?
Because I'm lucky like that.

271
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,750
Did they miss your heart
or they couldn't find it?

272
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,025
A little trick I learned
on the streets.

273
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:13,994
What street?

274
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,067
Take a deep breath.

275
00:26:25,808 --> 00:26:27,708
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

276
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:32,314
You must be great at
fucking parties, huh?

277
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:37,252
There's no sign of her.

278
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:38,820
This is bullshit!

279
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:40,923
I don't know what crazy
shit she gonna pull next.

280
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:43,958
I got solutions.
Cruel and permanent ones.

281
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:49,063
Don't always think
about with your dick.

282
00:26:54,937 --> 00:26:57,171
I think that's them.
You think?

283
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:07,281
I'm looking for a girl. A tall girl.
You seen a girl around here?

284
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,516
No, I didn't see anybody.

285
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:12,688
About 6-foot walking around looking
like Wonder Woman, and shit.

286
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:14,690
You sure you haven't seen her?

287
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:16,725
I just told you.
I didn't see anybody.

288
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:18,727
You couldn't miss her.
She's so tall.

289
00:27:18,728 --> 00:27:22,564
Legs so long they go up and
make an ass of themselves.

290
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:24,198
But you wouldn't know nothin'
about that, would you?

291
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:26,000
No, I wouldn't.

292
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:27,769
No, you wouldn't?

293
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,338
No.
Hmm.

294
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:31,705
Yo, that slut ain't anywhere.

295
00:27:31,974 --> 00:27:33,574
Hold up.

296
00:27:34,276 --> 00:27:37,312
Let me ask you a question.

297
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:40,047
If you could fuck one woman
in history, who would it be?

298
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:43,352
Hmm?

299
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:46,688
I'd fuck Eve and I'd
make Adam watch.

300
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:49,857
Flip his bitch over, fuck her in the
ass right in the Garden of Eden.

301
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:55,876
What's the matter?
You don't like no pussy from the Bible?

302
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:01,835
Come on, man.

303
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:14,449
So now what?

304
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,684
Now what, what?

305
00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:17,719
What do we do now? What's our plan?

306
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,455
Our plan? What the fuck
are you talking about?

307
00:28:20,456 --> 00:28:22,155
Maybe I should just grab my bag.

308
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:24,992
I told you. You ain't going nowhere.
Just sit down and be quiet.

309
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:27,763
In here or the bathroom?

310
00:28:27,764 --> 00:28:29,897
Whatever you want.
I don't care.

311
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:04,898
How'd you get, I don't know, involved
with those two circus freaks?

312
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:06,735
I met Lizard in a strip bar.

313
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:08,103
Which one's Lizard?

314
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:10,372
The one with the eye patch.

315
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,806
Oh. Are you a stripper?

316
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:13,173
No.

317
00:29:13,675 --> 00:29:15,610
Well, not anymore. I stopped.

318
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:17,779
It was just like, a part-time job.

319
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,516
What are you now?
A schoolteacher, a superhero?

320
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:26,153
You mean for work? Because I'm
kind of between jobs right now.

321
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:28,790
Of course you are.

322
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,659
Yeah. I'm trying to
find my true passion.

323
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:34,596
How old are you?

324
00:29:34,597 --> 00:29:37,966
- How old do you want me to be?
- I don't give a fuck, sweetheart.

325
00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:40,134
- Twenty.
- Bullshit!

326
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:43,136
All right, so how'd
you end up here?

327
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:46,608
I'm from Israel, originally.

328
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:49,144
I'm not asking for your entire life
history... What do you mean, "Israel"?

329
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:52,146
- You don't sound like you're from Israel.
- Yeah, but I like Israel.

330
00:29:53,148 --> 00:29:54,883
But you're not from there.

331
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:56,817
Doesn't matter.
I like Israel.

332
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:03,791
I love Israel.

333
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:10,653
All right. Um...
Just do me a favor.

334
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:13,123
Tell me where you were
directly before you were here?

335
00:30:14,736 --> 00:30:16,336
Florida.

336
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:18,106
And why here?

337
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,842
Because this is where the
motherfucker stopped.

338
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:22,744
Who's the Russian by the way?

339
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:24,146
That's Lizard's connection.

340
00:30:24,147 --> 00:30:25,747
Connection for what?

341
00:30:25,748 --> 00:30:27,182
Could I have a shot of that?

342
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:28,482
Sure.

343
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:30,484
Connection for what?

344
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,754
Can I have a glass, please?

345
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:45,866
Connection for what?

346
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:47,602
Crystal meth.

347
00:30:47,603 --> 00:30:48,837
You're dealing?

348
00:30:48,838 --> 00:30:50,505
I'm not dealing anything.

349
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:53,442
- Is that what you're on right now?
- I'm not on anything.

350
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:56,323
- You seem like you're on something.
- You seem like you're on something!

351
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,848
Go in the bathroom.
Why can't I stay out here?

352
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:01,183
Because I want you in the bathroom.

353
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:03,404
Go in there and close the
door right now, please.

354
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,754
Lock the door.

355
00:31:09,758 --> 00:31:11,593
Hello?

356
00:31:11,594 --> 00:31:12,961
Where are you?

357
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:15,230
Where do you think I am,
Harvey? You called me.

358
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:17,064
- Room 13?
- Yeah.

359
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:18,332
Room 13.

360
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,802
<i>Do you want me to ask you
what he asked me to ask you?</i>

361
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:25,574
Yes. I want you to ask me
what he asked you to ask me.

362
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:27,709
You have a Kindle or an iPad?

363
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,478
No, I don't have a
Kindle or an iPad.

364
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:30,612
<i>Have you read Hermann Hesse?</i>

365
00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:31,680
Who's Hermann Hesse?

366
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,747
I'm not a library, Jack.

367
00:31:32,748 --> 00:31:33,915
When is he coming here?

368
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:36,485
When he shows.

369
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:37,919
Just tell me when the fuck
he's going to be here, man!

370
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,387
<i>When he shows for crying out loud!</i>

371
00:32:19,995 --> 00:32:21,862
Get out here.

372
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:26,868
It would have been easy if I
had just stayed out here.

373
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:29,369
Okay, things have changed,

374
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:32,073
and you're free to go.

375
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:34,308
I won't go very far
with those two outside.

376
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:37,477
Yeah.

377
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:41,481
Okay.

378
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:45,587
Here's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to take you to a bus station,

379
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,722
I'm gonna give you some money,
I'm gonna put you on a bus, all right?

380
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:49,056
- When?
- Right now.

381
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,363
Why?

382
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:06,273
What do you mean, "Why?"
You want to go or not?

383
00:33:06,775 --> 00:33:08,610
Not.

384
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,612
You don't want to get out of here?
You don't want to go home?

385
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,412
I have no reason to.

386
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:17,285
Well, tough shit.
You got to go.

387
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,254
Why do you want me to go?

388
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:21,021
Don't ask stupid questions.

389
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,226
Okay.

390
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,042
So, is Dragna coming
to pick up the bag?

391
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,377
Hey!
You don't mention his name.

392
00:33:42,378 --> 00:33:45,313
All right?
You don't even think his fucking name!

393
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,016
Forget you know anything about this shit.
Do you understand?

394
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:49,951
How can I forget something
I already know?

395
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:52,354
Listen, I'm going to drive you to that
bus station, get you on that bus.

396
00:33:52,355 --> 00:33:54,889
You're gonna forget you know
anything about this shit.

397
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,057
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

398
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:11,972
So what kind of trouble are you in?

399
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:18,482
Why are you so nosy?

400
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,079
- Why?
- I'm just curious.

401
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,983
No, seriously, why would you do that?
Why are you like that?

402
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,186
'Cause I'm just trying to have
a civilized conversation.

403
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:27,822
No, you're not.
Why are you so nosy?

404
00:34:27,823 --> 00:34:29,891
I'm curious.

405
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:31,513
You know what that did to the cat.

406
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,165
So what's up with the
blood in your car?

407
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:42,337
All over the backseat.

408
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:44,272
It's from my hand, yeah.

409
00:34:44,273 --> 00:34:45,940
It's not from your hand.

410
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:47,375
Hey, what did I just tell you?
What?

411
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,310
About minding your own
fucking business?

412
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:51,212
I am. There's blood all over
your car. I'm sorry, I can't...

413
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:52,785
You know what? Let me
tell you something.

414
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,749
Maybe there's gonna be more
fucking blood in this car

415
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,952
if you don't shut your hole and
mind your own fucking business.

416
00:34:57,953 --> 00:34:59,287
It's none of your goddamn business.

417
00:34:59,288 --> 00:35:01,156
Well, I'm sorry for trying to help.

418
00:35:01,157 --> 00:35:04,157
Hey, just do me a favor, okay?
Don't help.

419
00:35:08,229 --> 00:35:09,931
Can I ask you something?

420
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:13,101
You wanna ask me something,
or everything under the sun?

421
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:14,335
Why are you doing this?

422
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:16,304
Why am I doing what?
Helping me?

423
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:18,106
I'm not helping you.
I am not helping you.

424
00:35:18,107 --> 00:35:19,808
I'm getting you out of the way.

425
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:22,069
However you want to look
at it, you're helping me.

426
00:35:23,144 --> 00:35:24,312
Whatever makes you happy.

427
00:35:24,313 --> 00:35:26,014
Stop being a dick
would make me happy.

428
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:28,215
Okay. You know what?

429
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:32,754
Get out of the car.

430
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,022
What the fuck is your problem?

431
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:35,724
Get out of the fucking car,
okay? Get out!

432
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:38,026
All right!

433
00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:39,928
Fucking asshole.
Here.

434
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,096
There. Bus stop's a few miles away.
Good luck.

435
00:35:43,998 --> 00:35:46,066
- Fucking asshole.
- Bye-bye.

436
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:20,267
Get in the car.

437
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:24,105
- Get in the fucking car.
- No.

438
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:25,540
Yes. Get in the fuckin...
No. No.

439
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:26,740
Come on!

440
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,842
Ow! Fuck!

441
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:41,956
So who is that, huh?

442
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:45,559
Is he a friend of, you know,
the person I can't say?

443
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:49,063
Is that the guy who shot you?

444
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,573
Why are you so curious, huh?
It's gonna get you killed one day.

445
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:03,343
Oh... Fucking...
You're pathetic.

446
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:07,445
What kind of idiot puts a body
in a trunk that can't close?

447
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:08,448
Shut up.

448
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:12,887
Shot in the head, huh?
What did he do?

449
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,623
Fuck.

450
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:22,163
We're fixing the tire.
Bend down. Bend down.

451
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:23,744
We're fixing the tire.
Bend down.

452
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:28,102
We can't just leave him in the trunk.
We have to get rid of it.

453
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:29,504
Shut up.

454
00:37:29,505 --> 00:37:31,172
There's five gallons of
blood in your back seat.

455
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:32,140
Somebody's going to see
it and call the police.

456
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:33,507
Shut the fuck up.

457
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:41,448
Ahh!

458
00:37:51,926 --> 00:37:53,760
What the hell is this?

459
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:56,030
What, are you deaf?
I asked you a question.

460
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:57,697
- What the hell is this?
- And you are?

461
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:01,469
That's what you get
for messing with my woman.

462
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,004
I'm not your woman.

463
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:04,738
You shut your hole up.

464
00:38:05,473 --> 00:38:06,975
Pop him, man.

465
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:08,142
Bobby, no.

466
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:09,244
I said, "Shut up."

467
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,082
I was hitching a ride and he pulled over.
He was just giving me a lift.

468
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,950
He was giving you a lift?
Yeah, I bet he was giving you a lift.

469
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:30,463
Are you fucking crazy?
Bitch, I wanna... I swear to God!

470
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:35,370
Fuck it. I'll pop him.

471
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:37,572
And afterwards, carry his body
into the woods and hide it.

472
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:38,673
You carry him.

473
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:40,441
- No, I'll shoot him.
- I'll shoot him.

474
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:42,110
- I'll shoot him.
- Then you carry him.

475
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,479
I should shoot your
little munchkin ass, too.

476
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,313
Then you'd only have more to carry.

477
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:50,585
Yeah, screw this, man.
Let's get out of here, man.

478
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:53,021
Too much fucking trouble.

479
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:56,624
Get your ass up.
Get up. Get over here.

480
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,793
Are you crazy?
I'm not playing with you!

481
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:01,461
Ahh!

482
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,533
Pull up.

483
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:11,905
Come here.
I got it. I got it.

484
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:15,809
I'm gonna get the bag.

485
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:19,879
Hold still. Hell's wrong with you?

486
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:28,288
And I'm not Russian.
I'm Serbian-Roma, you fuck.

487
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:39,833
Come on, man, let's go.

488
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:42,936
I pissed on his fucking head.

489
00:39:47,575 --> 00:39:50,144
Shit, man.
Where's the goddamn keys at?

490
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:53,847
Motherfuck.
Wanna be a freaking idiot?

491
00:39:54,716 --> 00:39:56,983
Yeah. I got your idiom.

492
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:15,835
Hey.

493
00:40:17,505 --> 00:40:21,541
Hey. Hey. Curious cat.

494
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:23,544
You all right?

495
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:48,001
God...

496
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:55,775
Ahh!

497
00:41:12,727 --> 00:41:14,394
Fuck.

498
00:41:26,307 --> 00:41:28,975
Oh, shit!

499
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:27,335
Thank you.

500
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,337
- Mr. Smith?
- Fuck.

501
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:33,506
Just hold that there.

502
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,545
Who is it?

503
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:38,978
It's me, Mr. Smith.

504
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,715
What do you want?

505
00:42:40,716 --> 00:42:42,850
Have you got a woman
in there with you?

506
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,252
Oh.

507
00:42:45,587 --> 00:42:46,953
What?

508
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:51,024
Mr. Smith.

509
00:42:52,393 --> 00:42:53,928
What do you want?

510
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:56,155
'Cause if you have a
woman in there with you,

511
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,666
I have to charge you $20
extra for double occupancy.

512
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:00,119
I don't have a woman in here.

513
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,203
I'm just saying, if you do have
a woman in there with you...

514
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,238
Well, I don't.

515
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,540
I'm just saying, if there was
someone in there with you...

516
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,174
I don't have one in here.

517
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:10,811
Now, listen to me.

518
00:43:10,812 --> 00:43:13,514
I wanna go to sleep now
because I'm very tired, okay?

519
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:16,249
Good night. Good night.

520
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:19,486
Good night.

521
00:43:35,436 --> 00:43:37,036
Don't fall asleep.

522
00:43:37,605 --> 00:43:38,940
Hey. Stay awake.

523
00:43:38,941 --> 00:43:40,273
I am awake.

524
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:43,142
Oh, fuck.

525
00:43:48,516 --> 00:43:50,618
Quick. There was a candle in
here somewhere, wasn't there?

526
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:53,186
Yeah. It's on top of the cabinet.

527
00:44:18,512 --> 00:44:19,714
Are you okay to move?

528
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:21,616
Move where?

529
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,019
Listen, Kitty Cat. Don't ask questions.
Are you okay to move or not?

530
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,953
Not.

531
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,788
Well...

532
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:30,291
Look, even if you're not okay
to move, you're gonna go.

533
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,392
Can you sit up?

534
00:44:31,393 --> 00:44:32,659
I mean...

535
00:44:37,298 --> 00:44:39,400
I don't understand.

536
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:41,836
One minute you're all worried
about if I'm all right.

537
00:44:41,837 --> 00:44:44,070
The next minute you're
kicking me out?

538
00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:46,573
What are you, schizo?

539
00:44:47,475 --> 00:44:49,242
You sound like my ex.

540
00:44:50,544 --> 00:44:52,145
Let's go.

541
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,856
Is it all right if I use the
bathroom before I go, master?

542
00:45:01,857 --> 00:45:03,056
Jesus Christ.

543
00:45:15,836 --> 00:45:17,670
Unbelievable.

544
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:41,961
Hey.

545
00:45:44,732 --> 00:45:46,933
I got this from Lizard's car.

546
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:51,639
It's the same picture
as the other one.

547
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,008
That much I know.

548
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:56,175
So we know as much as each other.

549
00:45:57,411 --> 00:45:59,980
Perhaps you know more.

550
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:02,016
I've been thinking, perhaps
you know a lot more.

551
00:46:14,095 --> 00:46:17,363
Mr. Smith. I'm Sheriff
Larson, this is Deputy Pike.

552
00:46:17,598 --> 00:46:18,998
Uh...

553
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:20,701
Hi.

554
00:46:20,702 --> 00:46:22,503
Is there a problem, Sheriff?

555
00:46:22,504 --> 00:46:25,039
Yes, there is a problem.

556
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,441
Two men and a girl were
staying in room 10.

557
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:30,410
We found the two men down the road.
Very dead.

558
00:46:30,778 --> 00:46:32,446
On the interstate?

559
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,291
No. Down the road. I was
wondering if you'd seen

560
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,985
anything unusual
around here tonight.

561
00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:40,219
- No, I didn't.
- Mmm.

562
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:45,092
We're looking for the girl.
She's tall, attractive, in her 20s.

563
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,560
Didn't happen to see her
around here tonight,

564
00:46:46,561 --> 00:46:47,828
did you?
No, I didn't.

565
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:48,929
No?
No.

566
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,464
Well, that's funny.

567
00:46:50,465 --> 00:46:53,201
'Cause someone said they thought
they saw you and a girl

568
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:54,935
getting in your car
earlier tonight.

569
00:46:54,936 --> 00:46:56,971
Who told you that?

570
00:46:56,972 --> 00:46:58,939
Who were you speaking to before?

571
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,642
I was on the phone, with my wife.

572
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:04,111
I heard you got into a little
trouble tonight, Mr. Smith.

573
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,913
Excuse me?

574
00:47:05,914 --> 00:47:07,454
With your wife.
She stabbed you.

575
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:11,152
Yes. It's nothing serious.

576
00:47:11,153 --> 00:47:12,887
Where you from, Mr. Smith?
Pittsburgh.

577
00:47:12,888 --> 00:47:14,188
What brings you here?

578
00:47:14,189 --> 00:47:16,123
I'm just passing through.

579
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,558
- Passing through?
- Yeah.

580
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:19,160
You drive 300 miles
with a stab wound.

581
00:47:19,161 --> 00:47:20,995
I find that odd,
Mr. Smith. Don't you?

582
00:47:20,996 --> 00:47:23,196
Not if you know my wife.

583
00:47:27,201 --> 00:47:31,071
You're traveling light, Mr. Smith.
No credit cards.

584
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:34,240
But you didn't forget
your cash, did you?

585
00:47:35,142 --> 00:47:38,211
I carry my money separate.
In a rubber band.

586
00:47:40,448 --> 00:47:42,216
What is it that you do in
Pittsburgh, Mr. Smith?

587
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:43,751
I work for the city.

588
00:47:43,752 --> 00:47:45,786
What's with the third degree here?

589
00:47:45,787 --> 00:47:47,855
I mean, I told you
I didn't see anybody.

590
00:47:47,856 --> 00:47:49,523
When do you plan on leaving?

591
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:51,257
Ask him.

592
00:47:51,992 --> 00:47:53,961
Ask him.
He knows everything.

593
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:55,795
- He knows everything about me.
- Ned.

594
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:57,932
How long is he staying?

595
00:47:57,933 --> 00:47:59,467
Just for the night.

596
00:47:59,468 --> 00:48:01,101
- See?
- Just for the night?

597
00:48:01,102 --> 00:48:02,303
That's what he said.

598
00:48:02,404 --> 00:48:06,507
Yeah. Gonna go back in the morning
and patch things up with my wife.

599
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,042
That's it.

600
00:48:08,043 --> 00:48:10,811
You know, Bob's your uncle.
Mmm-hmm.

601
00:48:10,812 --> 00:48:13,379
Well, good night, Mr. Smith.
All right.

602
00:48:16,517 --> 00:48:17,852
Get that hand seen to.

603
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,393
Yeah. It's fine.
Thank you, sir.

604
00:48:21,956 --> 00:48:23,356
Ned.

605
00:48:32,032 --> 00:48:33,501
Hey, you.

606
00:48:33,502 --> 00:48:34,801
Mr. Smith.

607
00:48:37,004 --> 00:48:38,971
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

608
00:48:39,673 --> 00:48:41,075
What do you mean?

609
00:48:41,076 --> 00:48:43,544
Where do you get off telling
them my life story?

610
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:47,114
It's my civic duty.
I've known the sheriff for a long time.

611
00:48:47,115 --> 00:48:49,083
Listen to me, you little rodent.

612
00:48:49,084 --> 00:48:51,185
You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

613
00:48:51,186 --> 00:48:53,888
Now, you back to your office and you
mind your own goddamn business.

614
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,856
Do you understand me?

615
00:48:55,857 --> 00:48:57,456
Don't touch my wheelchair.

616
00:49:02,763 --> 00:49:05,498
You shouldn't have
done that, Mr. Smith.

617
00:49:06,634 --> 00:49:09,035
No one touches my wheelchair.

618
00:49:10,538 --> 00:49:13,139
It belongs to my dead mother.

619
00:49:34,094 --> 00:49:37,163
Hey. Wake up. Wake up.

620
00:49:47,174 --> 00:49:48,608
I'm okay.

621
00:49:49,677 --> 00:49:51,510
Put that on your head.

622
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,214
Just got dizzy there for a minute.

623
00:49:58,786 --> 00:50:00,054
Keep the ice on your head.

624
00:50:00,055 --> 00:50:02,756
I'm fine, okay?
I said, keep it on your head.

625
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:04,091
I'm fine.

626
00:50:04,092 --> 00:50:06,627
Put it up there.

627
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,796
God, is that why she left you?

628
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,463
- Who?
- Your ex?

629
00:50:11,098 --> 00:50:12,365
My ex died.

630
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:20,074
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

631
00:50:20,075 --> 00:50:22,375
- Do you?
- Yeah.

632
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,646
What's your name?
Mine is Rivka.

633
00:50:29,149 --> 00:50:31,117
My name is Jack.

634
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:33,419
Were you married?

635
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:36,355
We were going to.

636
00:50:37,758 --> 00:50:39,225
We were going to be married.

637
00:50:42,296 --> 00:50:44,096
She got murdered.

638
00:50:45,399 --> 00:50:48,135
She didn't want me to
do certain things,

639
00:50:48,136 --> 00:50:50,503
and I had to do certain
things for money.

640
00:50:52,373 --> 00:50:55,708
And we got into a fight about
it and she stormed out.

641
00:50:57,211 --> 00:51:00,279
I had to go do this thing.
While I was away...

642
00:51:02,816 --> 00:51:04,717
She got killed.

643
00:51:05,152 --> 00:51:08,154
Sorry. That's awful.

644
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:25,671
You can chill out here for a little while
longer, then you gotta get up and go.

645
00:51:26,974 --> 00:51:28,809
Tell me about Dragna.

646
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,443
Why don't you tell me about him?

647
00:51:31,812 --> 00:51:33,447
I don't know anything about him.

648
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:35,281
No?
No.

649
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,484
You wanna talk about this?

650
00:51:42,089 --> 00:51:44,557
Anything you wanna tell me?

651
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,629
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

652
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:55,034
I'm gonna give you a
chance to answer honestly.

653
00:51:56,904 --> 00:51:58,072
Did you look in that bag?

654
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,373
Don't have to look

655
00:51:59,374 --> 00:52:01,442
in the bag of
allegiance to know that

656
00:52:01,443 --> 00:52:03,509
it's worth more than
what you're getting.

657
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,281
I'm gonna go out.
Lock the door behind me.

658
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,651
What happens if he
knocks on the door?

659
00:52:14,455 --> 00:52:17,491
Believe me, Dragna
doesn't knock on doors.

660
00:52:17,492 --> 00:52:18,724
Where you going?

661
00:53:19,787 --> 00:53:22,122
What are you doing there,
Mr. Smith?

662
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:23,522
Oh.

663
00:53:24,224 --> 00:53:25,658
He walks.

664
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:29,396
It's a remarkable recovery.

665
00:53:29,397 --> 00:53:33,299
I think it's best that
you just dig that up

666
00:53:33,934 --> 00:53:36,635
and you throw that over here.

667
00:53:39,439 --> 00:53:41,674
I said, "Start digging"!

668
00:53:44,511 --> 00:53:48,314
You see, I heard you on the phone.
I know what's going on.

669
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:50,517
It's not what you think.

670
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,452
No, it's not what you think!

671
00:53:52,453 --> 00:53:53,819
Okay.

672
00:53:56,523 --> 00:54:01,260
You see, what you don't know is
that man, he's been here before.

673
00:54:01,495 --> 00:54:02,830
What man? Who?

674
00:54:02,831 --> 00:54:04,230
On the phone!

675
00:54:05,866 --> 00:54:08,936
It's been years,

676
00:54:08,937 --> 00:54:13,706
but that voice I'll never forget
and what he done here before.

677
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:17,945
You don't know what
you're getting into, man.

678
00:54:17,946 --> 00:54:19,279
Oh, that's funny,

679
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,617
because that's what I was
just about to say to you.

680
00:54:23,618 --> 00:54:26,253
Can you stop shining that light in my
eyes? I can't see what I'm digging.

681
00:54:26,254 --> 00:54:27,621
- You just keep digging.
- Okay, okay.

682
00:54:27,622 --> 00:54:29,489
- I don't owe him nothing this time.
- Okay. Okay.

683
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,991
- You understand?
- Yeah, yeah.

684
00:54:30,992 --> 00:54:33,692
You get that out of the hole.
Okay. Okay.

685
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:40,133
That's good.
Put it down right there.

686
00:54:40,134 --> 00:54:42,536
Move back away.
Go on. Move away.

687
00:54:42,537 --> 00:54:44,470
- Get back over there.
- Okay.

688
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,181
Goddamn.

689
00:54:56,116 --> 00:54:58,484
Ow! Ow!

690
00:55:00,454 --> 00:55:01,854
God!

691
00:55:04,491 --> 00:55:06,225
Damn it.

692
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,880
Fuck.

693
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,305
Come on, Kitty.
We're going, Kitty.

694
00:56:26,506 --> 00:56:28,474
What's going on?

695
00:56:48,028 --> 00:56:49,129
Who is it?

696
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:50,596
Sheriff Larson.

697
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:55,669
Did I wake you, Mr. Smith?

698
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,270
No, I was just lying down.

699
00:56:57,271 --> 00:56:58,904
Unlock the door, please.

700
00:57:06,279 --> 00:57:08,947
Hmm. Did she drive all the way
out here and stab you again?

701
00:57:10,584 --> 00:57:12,519
No, no, it just started
bleeding again.

702
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,087
You should get that checked out.

703
00:57:14,088 --> 00:57:15,454
It's fine.

704
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:17,724
You haven't seen Mr. Stenson
around, have you?

705
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,292
Who?

706
00:57:19,293 --> 00:57:20,593
The manager of the hotel.

707
00:57:21,294 --> 00:57:23,063
- No.
- That's funny.

708
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,098
We've been looking everywhere
for him, we can't find him.

709
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:26,733
But his car's parked out front.

710
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,469
Oh, maybe he's skulking around,
doing wheelies or something.

711
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:30,704
I don't know.

712
00:57:30,705 --> 00:57:31,937
Maybe.

713
00:57:43,483 --> 00:57:45,118
When are you leaving, Mr. Smith?

714
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,885
Uh...

715
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:48,655
In the morning.

716
00:57:48,656 --> 00:57:49,790
In the morning?

717
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:51,590
Yeah.

718
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,828
Back to Pittsburgh?

719
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:56,829
Yeah.

720
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,201
Yeah.

721
00:58:01,202 --> 00:58:04,002
Gotta go patch things
up with my wife.

722
00:58:05,605 --> 00:58:07,107
Mmm.

723
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:11,845
I realized I probably
brought this on myself.

724
00:58:11,846 --> 00:58:13,946
It's my fault.

725
00:58:42,142 --> 00:58:43,809
Well, well, well.

726
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,578
What do we have here?

727
00:58:46,713 --> 00:58:48,046
Yours?

728
00:58:48,782 --> 00:58:50,082
My wife's.

729
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,621
Your wife's?

730
00:59:10,704 --> 00:59:12,137
And this?

731
00:59:15,442 --> 00:59:17,344
I don't know, it was in
the room when I got here.

732
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,745
Hmm.

733
00:59:18,746 --> 00:59:21,747
A Gideon Bible and a
shovel in every room.

734
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,222
You're under arrest, Mr. Smith.

735
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:31,525
Something's come to light
since our last meeting.

736
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,192
What the fuck?

737
00:59:36,396 --> 00:59:37,996
Gotcha.

738
00:59:39,633 --> 00:59:43,270
Now, will you give me a
reason to break your skull?

739
00:59:43,271 --> 00:59:47,606
I challenge you to a battle of
wits but you'll be unarmed.

740
01:00:51,271 --> 01:00:53,071
Nice, Jones.

741
01:01:04,484 --> 01:01:07,152
Okay, boys, you know what to do.

742
01:01:14,262 --> 01:01:16,161
Why? Why am I here?

743
01:01:16,596 --> 01:01:19,064
Target practice, Mr. Smith.

744
01:01:27,974 --> 01:01:30,742
Where did you bury it, Mr. Smith?

745
01:01:31,378 --> 01:01:32,612
Bury what?

746
01:01:32,613 --> 01:01:35,047
The bag, Mr. Smith. The bag.

747
01:01:35,048 --> 01:01:36,615
What bag?

748
01:01:37,317 --> 01:01:39,051
There's two ways this can work.

749
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:40,787
I can beat you to death,

750
01:01:40,788 --> 01:01:43,989
or two, you can tell me
where you put it.

751
01:01:52,366 --> 01:01:56,469
Just because it's inevitable doesn't
mean it's imminent, Mr. Smith.

752
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:59,472
I have all night.
My shift doesn't finish till 7:00.

753
01:02:03,843 --> 01:02:07,881
We have a long, long way to go.

754
01:02:07,882 --> 01:02:10,882
Chief. I got your
wife on the phone.

755
01:02:17,824 --> 01:02:20,660
Why did you tell her I was here?

756
01:02:20,661 --> 01:02:22,762
What was I supposed to say?
That I'm not here.

757
01:02:26,032 --> 01:02:27,265
Hey.

758
01:02:29,069 --> 01:02:32,004
Macadamia Chocolate crunch.
That's...

759
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:37,110
I don't like Chunky Monkey.

760
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:38,677
Mmm-hmm.

761
01:02:39,379 --> 01:02:40,812
Yeah.

762
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:43,416
Can I help you?

763
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:48,120
I think you're looking for me.
I'm the girl from the motel.

764
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:49,788
Huh.

765
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,991
You were with those two in the car?

766
01:02:53,526 --> 01:02:54,694
Yeah, that's me.

767
01:02:54,695 --> 01:02:56,128
Who you looking for?

768
01:02:56,996 --> 01:02:58,498
I'm not looking for anyone.

769
01:02:58,499 --> 01:03:00,198
Is that right? Mmm.

770
01:03:01,568 --> 01:03:04,102
Come with me. It's okay.

771
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,981
You know him?

772
01:03:14,982 --> 01:03:16,248
No.

773
01:03:27,394 --> 01:03:31,329
Now, what have we got in here, huh?
What do we have in here?

774
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:36,536
Oh.

775
01:03:36,537 --> 01:03:39,805
I don't know this bitch.
She's got nothing to do with me.

776
01:03:41,908 --> 01:03:45,877
Looks like we have a bad girl.
Bad girls need to be punished.

777
01:03:48,782 --> 01:03:52,184
Deputy Pike. Deputy Pike.

778
01:03:52,185 --> 01:03:54,421
Check her good.

779
01:03:54,422 --> 01:03:57,023
Coke whores will hide it
just about anywhere.

780
01:03:57,024 --> 01:03:58,525
Get in here.

781
01:03:58,526 --> 01:04:01,860
Check every spot. Every hole.

782
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:09,334
Come on, get in here.

783
01:04:14,741 --> 01:04:18,778
Hey, stupid bitch. Yeah.

784
01:04:20,548 --> 01:04:22,948
Yeah?

785
01:04:25,084 --> 01:04:27,454
Hold her. Grab her hands.

786
01:04:27,455 --> 01:04:30,188
Look what we got here.

787
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,128
Well, well, well.

788
01:04:35,129 --> 01:04:37,730
Looks like she intended
to hurt you, Deputy Pike.

789
01:04:37,731 --> 01:04:40,166
Make sure she doesn't have
a shotgun up her ass.

790
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,867
Oh, let's check.

791
01:04:41,935 --> 01:04:43,401
Mr. Smith.

792
01:04:45,538 --> 01:04:48,240
Thought these were yours,
Mr. Smith.

793
01:04:49,008 --> 01:04:51,678
Oh, Christ.

794
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,112
But we do know they're
panties, don't we?

795
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:15,554
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

796
01:05:20,573 --> 01:05:22,040
Where is it?

797
01:05:22,675 --> 01:05:24,042
It's at the motel.

798
01:05:24,177 --> 01:05:25,512
Where at the motel?

799
01:05:25,513 --> 01:05:27,247
It's too dark.
It's impossible to find.

800
01:05:27,248 --> 01:05:29,516
I had to walk through the forest.

801
01:05:29,517 --> 01:05:31,050
Just tell me where it is.
I'll take you right there.

802
01:05:31,051 --> 01:05:32,884
I gotta walk you there.

803
01:05:34,554 --> 01:05:36,689
If this is some kind
of wild goose chase

804
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:38,857
we will take liberties
with this girl.

805
01:05:39,859 --> 01:05:41,426
I'll take you right to it.

806
01:05:43,897 --> 01:05:45,064
Deputy Pike,
you look after Miss Pretty.

807
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:46,566
Gladly.

808
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,800
Jones, come with me.

809
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:49,135
Sir.

810
01:05:49,136 --> 01:05:50,936
I'll grab the car.

811
01:06:07,253 --> 01:06:08,620
Get up.

812
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:16,062
Do you have any idea
what I'm gonna do to you

813
01:06:16,063 --> 01:06:18,230
if they don't come
back with that bag?

814
01:06:18,231 --> 01:06:19,865
Hey.

815
01:06:33,146 --> 01:06:34,512
Pike!

816
01:06:35,615 --> 01:06:36,982
Pike!

817
01:06:37,684 --> 01:06:39,352
Pike!

818
01:06:39,353 --> 01:06:41,286
Sheriff. Get in here.

819
01:06:42,355 --> 01:06:43,923
Sheriff.

820
01:06:43,924 --> 01:06:45,658
- Keys.
- I can't find them.

821
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:47,025
Gun.

822
01:06:48,728 --> 01:06:50,362
Ahh!
Pike!

823
01:07:28,768 --> 01:07:30,269
You all right?

824
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:33,171
Yeah. It's not deep.

825
01:07:43,182 --> 01:07:45,351
That's a lot of bodies
to leave lying around.

826
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:46,686
You'd rather we put
'em in the trunk?

827
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,721
Please, the trunk
that never closes?

828
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:55,995
Before I speak, is there anything
else in here I should know about?

829
01:07:55,996 --> 01:07:57,296
What do you mean?

830
01:07:57,297 --> 01:07:59,932
Guns, knives, dynamite,
uranium, nunchucks?

831
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:01,801
Amazing what a curious
kitty can find

832
01:08:01,802 --> 01:08:03,369
just lying around your
average motel room.

833
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,905
Guns, bodies...

834
01:08:05,906 --> 01:08:07,940
I wouldn't like to
be your neighbor.

835
01:08:07,941 --> 01:08:10,410
Playing the TV too loud were they?

836
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:14,814
Oh, TV! You're in the
movie now, starring role.

837
01:08:14,815 --> 01:08:16,382
Oh, I know.

838
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:18,317
No. I don't think you do.

839
01:08:18,318 --> 01:08:20,019
We just killed three cops.

840
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:23,222
They were ready to take us God
knows where and dump our bodies.

841
01:08:23,223 --> 01:08:26,624
Even if you would've dug it up,
he still would've killed you!

842
01:08:33,733 --> 01:08:35,367
What do you mean, "Dug it up"?

843
01:08:37,203 --> 01:08:41,539
I mean, if you would've given
him the bag, you know...

844
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:46,412
How would they know I buried it?

845
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,948
Well, when you walked
in with a shovel,

846
01:08:48,949 --> 01:08:52,617
I didn't think you were doing some
late-night gardening behind the motel.

847
01:08:53,786 --> 01:08:56,322
Well, how do you know
it was behind the motel?

848
01:08:58,892 --> 01:09:01,659
Fine, you buried it
in front of the motel.

849
01:09:06,866 --> 01:09:09,936
I swear to God,
if that bag isn't there,

850
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:13,306
I will dig a hole and I
will bury you in the woods.

851
01:09:13,307 --> 01:09:15,908
I didn't have to come for you.

852
01:09:15,909 --> 01:09:19,378
I could've taken that bag
and left you there,

853
01:09:19,379 --> 01:09:23,349
and they would've killed you and
they never would've found me.

854
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,583
I got shot saving you!

855
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,688
You're an idiot, you know that?

856
01:09:34,894 --> 01:09:36,329
Maybe.

857
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,530
Yes, you are.

858
01:09:37,531 --> 01:09:39,198
I'll drive.

859
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,833
Look for the keys.

860
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:42,534
Okay.

861
01:10:15,001 --> 01:10:17,502
All right, let's shoot
these handcuffs off.

862
01:10:19,205 --> 01:10:20,540
I like hearing that.

863
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:22,507
Come on.

864
01:10:28,314 --> 01:10:30,315
Here.

865
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:33,284
I got it.

866
01:10:40,193 --> 01:10:42,160
Okay.

867
01:10:43,529 --> 01:10:45,932
Is this how your hand got shot?

868
01:10:45,933 --> 01:10:47,967
If you shoot me in the hand,
I'll fucking kill you.

869
01:10:47,968 --> 01:10:50,336
You shouldn't threaten a
person pointing a gun at you.

870
01:10:50,337 --> 01:10:52,570
All right. Right.
Go right to the chain.

871
01:10:53,105 --> 01:10:54,273
What if I miss?

872
01:10:54,274 --> 01:10:56,509
You're not gonna
shoot me from Texas.

873
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:59,410
Just come right up
to the chain, okay?

874
01:11:00,246 --> 01:11:02,081
Ready?

875
01:11:02,082 --> 01:11:06,185
No, no, down lower, lower.
Don't point it at my fucking hand.

876
01:11:06,186 --> 01:11:08,054
Right there. You ready?
Yeah.

877
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,889
Count of three.
Yeah, I think you're on the chain.

878
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,557
Okay.

879
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:14,159
One...

880
01:11:15,928 --> 01:11:17,129
That's a hit!

881
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:19,597
No, no, no. That's a miss.

882
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:22,935
Thank you.

883
01:11:22,936 --> 01:11:26,838
Seems like a waste of a perfectly
good pair of handcuffs to me.

884
01:11:43,189 --> 01:11:45,456
Another time, another place.

885
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,394
Where are you going?

886
01:12:57,363 --> 01:12:58,497
I was thinking.

887
01:12:58,498 --> 01:12:59,864
Yeah?

888
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,636
Let's get out of here.

889
01:13:03,637 --> 01:13:04,737
Take that bag with us?

890
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:06,571
Yeah.

891
01:13:10,176 --> 01:13:11,344
Where do you want to go?

892
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,744
You name it.

893
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,861
That's cute.

894
01:13:17,984 --> 01:13:18,950
Hello.

895
01:13:20,753 --> 01:13:22,420
Hello?

896
01:13:26,759 --> 01:13:29,427
You're out of your mind.
Come on, you gotta go.

897
01:13:30,563 --> 01:13:32,064
Where the hell am I going to go?

898
01:13:32,065 --> 01:13:33,566
You... How the hell should
I know where you go?

899
01:13:33,567 --> 01:13:35,501
You go home.

900
01:13:35,502 --> 01:13:37,902
I don't wanna go home.
I wanna stay.

901
01:13:40,139 --> 01:13:42,775
Everything is so...

902
01:13:42,776 --> 01:13:44,577
Every time I try to do something...

903
01:13:44,578 --> 01:13:48,080
I mean, I don't even
give a damn anymore.

904
01:13:48,081 --> 01:13:50,216
But I mean...

905
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,751
Someone like you.

906
01:13:51,752 --> 01:13:53,751
Someone like me what?

907
01:13:55,221 --> 01:13:57,955
Someone like you... I mean...

908
01:13:59,492 --> 01:14:02,461
I can feel you.

909
01:14:02,462 --> 01:14:05,531
What the fuck are
you talking about?

910
01:14:05,532 --> 01:14:08,833
You know, like I know you.

911
01:14:09,502 --> 01:14:11,070
You don't know Jack.

912
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,904
Please.

913
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,575
I don't know

914
01:14:16,576 --> 01:14:19,712
if he's coming to take
the bag and kill me.

915
01:14:19,713 --> 01:14:22,214
I don't know if he's coming
to take the bag and pay me.

916
01:14:22,215 --> 01:14:24,116
I don't know if he's
coming by himself

917
01:14:24,117 --> 01:14:26,018
or he's coming with a
whole fucking army.

918
01:14:26,786 --> 01:14:28,820
You gotta go.

919
01:14:36,195 --> 01:14:38,062
It's impossible.

920
01:14:39,532 --> 01:14:40,998
I made a deal.

921
01:14:56,415 --> 01:14:59,518
Well, I guess that's that.

922
01:14:59,519 --> 01:15:02,487
Maybe we'll run into
each other someday.

923
01:15:04,123 --> 01:15:05,490
Yeah, maybe.

924
01:15:07,526 --> 01:15:10,027
Kitty Cat's gotta go her own way.

925
01:15:12,565 --> 01:15:15,734
Cats are amazing animals though.

926
01:15:15,735 --> 01:15:17,803
Survive all sorts of terrible shit,

927
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:20,206
they always land up on their feet.

928
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:21,906
Not always.

929
01:15:28,881 --> 01:15:30,681
Good-bye.

930
01:16:18,564 --> 01:16:19,865
Quickly.

931
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:24,436
Quick, quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

932
01:16:24,437 --> 01:16:26,103
Shit.
Come on.

933
01:16:27,673 --> 01:16:29,909
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.

934
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:31,210
Come on.

935
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:33,778
Come on.

936
01:16:42,188 --> 01:16:43,856
Why are we hiding?

937
01:16:43,857 --> 01:16:46,524
We're just gonna take
a minute to think.

938
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:54,333
How about that for an entrance?

939
01:16:54,334 --> 01:16:57,303
Lucky there are
interconnecting rooms.

940
01:16:57,304 --> 01:16:58,970
Put the pistol on the bed.

941
01:17:06,979 --> 01:17:09,547
Make him comfortable.

942
01:17:11,617 --> 01:17:13,251
Sit.

943
01:17:13,586 --> 01:17:16,288
You too.

944
01:17:16,289 --> 01:17:18,390
Tell me something, Jack,

945
01:17:18,391 --> 01:17:20,759
I always thought that the number 13

946
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,229
had a one and then
a three right after it.

947
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:25,264
But, you know, it's been a
while since grade school,

948
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:27,499
so, you know,
I could have that wrong.

949
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,867
We have a problem, Jack?

950
01:17:28,868 --> 01:17:31,270
No.

951
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:33,305
Because when I tell you
to wait in room 13

952
01:17:33,306 --> 01:17:35,241
and I see you waiting in room 14,

953
01:17:35,242 --> 01:17:36,342
it makes me ponder,

954
01:17:36,343 --> 01:17:37,843
"Why would Jack go into room 14

955
01:17:37,844 --> 01:17:41,013
"when I explicitly told him
to go into room 13?"

956
01:17:41,014 --> 01:17:44,750
I mean that's exceedingly
specific, is it not?

957
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:48,020
I know you can count because you're
an eminently intelligent person,

958
01:17:48,021 --> 01:17:51,657
so I know it can't be any
sort of cognitive issue.

959
01:17:51,658 --> 01:17:53,259
So what is it?

960
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:56,328
I muse upon this and I start to think,
"Well, there must be a problem."

961
01:17:56,329 --> 01:17:58,564
There's no problem.
I got the bag. I just want...

962
01:17:58,565 --> 01:18:00,032
No, there is a problem, Jack.

963
01:18:00,033 --> 01:18:03,269
Distrust is a disease
that kills a friendship.

964
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:08,574
When you sneak into room 14 after
I specifically told you room 13,

965
01:18:08,575 --> 01:18:11,343
that's because you clearly
don't trust me, Jack.

966
01:18:11,344 --> 01:18:15,814
That's a problem. When I see that you're
starting to lose your trust in me, Jack,

967
01:18:15,815 --> 01:18:19,351
then I, reciprocally,
start to lose my trust in you.

968
01:18:19,352 --> 01:18:21,654
I start to think,
"Maybe I can't trust this Jack."

969
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,322
I don't mean
disrespect or anything,

970
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:24,723
but how am I supposed to trust you?

971
01:18:24,724 --> 01:18:26,525
You send Bishop out after me.

972
01:18:26,526 --> 01:18:28,360
He tries to kill me.
He ends up shooting me in the hand...

973
01:18:28,361 --> 01:18:29,962
Well, frankly, I never
really cared much for Bishop.

974
01:18:29,963 --> 01:18:32,831
What about those two
cartoon Feds next door?

975
01:18:32,832 --> 01:18:34,867
With the silencers,
they were stalking deer?

976
01:18:34,868 --> 01:18:36,535
Jack, come on.
If I wanted you dead,

977
01:18:36,536 --> 01:18:39,036
we wouldn't even be talking
right now. You know that.

978
01:18:39,037 --> 01:18:41,674
But I have to admit, you're
a one-man demolition crew.

979
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:44,510
I've owned this motel, the Sheriff

980
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:47,346
and everything within
miles for years.

981
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:50,382
It's been the favorite place
for drop offs, you name it.

982
01:18:50,383 --> 01:18:51,469
But I am impressed.

983
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:53,786
Just because you're paranoid doesn't
mean they're not after you.

984
01:18:53,787 --> 01:18:55,821
You certainly raised the bar.

985
01:18:55,822 --> 01:18:58,324
I hear I even lost
my Russian dwarf.

986
01:18:58,325 --> 01:18:59,692
He was Serbian-Roma.

987
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,393
Did you ever get a
chance to take a look

988
01:19:01,394 --> 01:19:04,029
at that Hermann Hesse novel I
recommended, <i>Magister Ludi?</i>

989
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:06,332
I just want my money,
get out of here.

990
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:07,800
Can I give you a little
bit of advice, Jack?

991
01:19:07,801 --> 01:19:09,635
Yeah.

992
01:19:09,636 --> 01:19:13,105
If you took one-tenth of the
time you spend on killing people

993
01:19:13,106 --> 01:19:15,674
and devoted it to reading
a book now and then,

994
01:19:15,675 --> 01:19:18,977
I really think you would derive
great benefit. Don't you?

995
01:19:18,978 --> 01:19:21,013
I just want my goddamn money.
That's it.

996
01:19:21,014 --> 01:19:22,647
Jack,

997
01:19:23,549 --> 01:19:25,951
you're not gonna introduce
me to your friend here?

998
01:19:25,952 --> 01:19:27,419
She's not a part of this.

999
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,988
Oh, yes, she is a part of it.

1000
01:19:29,989 --> 01:19:31,990
You have a whore sitting here
in the middle of our business,

1001
01:19:31,991 --> 01:19:34,026
you made her a part of it, Jack.

1002
01:19:34,027 --> 01:19:36,827
You know what
<i>"Magister Ludi"</i>means, Jack?

1003
01:19:37,029 --> 01:19:38,362
Master of the game.

1004
01:19:38,897 --> 01:19:40,733
Master of the game!

1005
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:43,035
Would it surprise you
if you found out

1006
01:19:43,036 --> 01:19:45,504
that this hot Tic Tac
here worked for me?

1007
01:19:45,505 --> 01:19:47,106
Possible, right?

1008
01:19:47,107 --> 01:19:48,707
I mean, come on, dude.

1009
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:50,976
You check into a motel in
the middle of nowhere,

1010
01:19:50,977 --> 01:19:53,912
and you just happen to meet this
six-foot, weapons-proficient stripper

1011
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:56,382
with aspirations to teach
second-grade in Kansas.

1012
01:19:56,383 --> 01:19:57,549
What are the odds on that?

1013
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:01,053
I mean, I guess it could happen.
I met my wife at a fucking Staples.

1014
01:20:01,054 --> 01:20:02,388
Listen to me.

1015
01:20:02,389 --> 01:20:03,956
What's really happened here, huh?

1016
01:20:03,957 --> 01:20:06,058
Nothing. Nothing.
It's a business transaction.

1017
01:20:06,059 --> 01:20:07,726
I did everything you
asked me to do.

1018
01:20:07,727 --> 01:20:09,428
I'm sitting here in
this goddamn motel.

1019
01:20:09,429 --> 01:20:11,497
I'm going out of my mind
in this goddamn motel.

1020
01:20:11,498 --> 01:20:13,238
And all I want to
do is get my money.

1021
01:20:13,499 --> 01:20:15,032
Tell me the truth.

1022
01:20:16,735 --> 01:20:18,470
Did you look inside the bag?

1023
01:20:18,471 --> 01:20:20,539
We had a deal. No.

1024
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,874
Anybody see it?

1025
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,108
No.

1026
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:24,109
You show it to anybody?

1027
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,644
No.

1028
01:20:25,645 --> 01:20:28,286
How about your girlfriend here?
She sneak a little peek inside?

1029
01:20:31,049 --> 01:20:32,917
No.

1030
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:47,900
Death is inside that bag.

1031
01:20:47,901 --> 01:20:50,334
Did Jack tell you that?

1032
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:52,671
No.

1033
01:20:52,672 --> 01:20:54,840
We had an agreement.
I kept my end of the bargain.

1034
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:56,708
You either believe me or you don't.

1035
01:20:56,709 --> 01:21:00,111
Trust, the foundation
of friendship.

1036
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,380
No, I trust you.

1037
01:21:08,053 --> 01:21:09,188
Okay.

1038
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:13,057
The bag, Jack, where's the bag?

1039
01:21:18,664 --> 01:21:21,365
Under the bed. That's just genius.

1040
01:21:23,802 --> 01:21:25,269
Huh?

1041
01:21:26,772 --> 01:21:28,139
On the bed.

1042
01:21:48,994 --> 01:21:50,494
Unbelievable.

1043
01:21:53,165 --> 01:21:55,634
I wish I could share this
with you, Jack. I do.

1044
01:21:55,635 --> 01:21:57,836
But as fate would
have it, I just can't.

1045
01:21:57,837 --> 01:21:59,204
I want you to know something.

1046
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:04,408
All this, everything, was a
test, Jack, to test you.

1047
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:06,544
To test our friendship.

1048
01:22:07,179 --> 01:22:08,981
I have a job.

1049
01:22:08,982 --> 01:22:11,617
It's more than a job,
it's a life changer.

1050
01:22:11,618 --> 01:22:14,253
I need one man,
just one special man.

1051
01:22:14,254 --> 01:22:16,788
With your cut, you can buy
your own private island

1052
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:19,725
and you can fly there in your
own Boeing Business Jet.

1053
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:21,927
I told you not to look in
the bag and you didn't.

1054
01:22:21,928 --> 01:22:25,197
You kept your word.
You passed.

1055
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:27,099
I am so proud of you.

1056
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,001
This Pavlovian loyalty of yours

1057
01:22:29,002 --> 01:22:30,869
is really kind of mind-boggling.

1058
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:33,005
You're a total throwback.

1059
01:22:33,006 --> 01:22:36,008
I mean, you're like some blacksmith
in colonial Williamsburg.

1060
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:38,243
You're like an aborigine
with a boomerang

1061
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:41,245
hunting in the diorama of some natural
history museum. Unbelievable.

1062
01:22:41,246 --> 01:22:43,181
How do you know I'm not lying?
Oh, I know.

1063
01:22:43,182 --> 01:22:47,019
Trust me. It would be
all over your face.

1064
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:51,256
There's money and very, very important
instructions in that satchel.

1065
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:53,123
Goose.

1066
01:22:54,226 --> 01:22:55,961
- Do you believe me?
- Sure.

1067
01:22:55,962 --> 01:22:59,030
You wanna count it?
Of course not.

1068
01:22:59,031 --> 01:23:03,335
Now we have trust again,
as I would have predicted.

1069
01:23:03,336 --> 01:23:06,204
You know, when you're aware,
Jack, of someone's tropisms,

1070
01:23:06,205 --> 01:23:08,640
you can predict what
directions he'll turn in

1071
01:23:08,641 --> 01:23:11,043
in response to certain stimuli.

1072
01:23:11,044 --> 01:23:13,712
People are what they are
and they do what they do.

1073
01:23:13,713 --> 01:23:17,149
Does Kojak cook kasha? No.
Kojak sucks on Tootsie Pops.

1074
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:19,217
People always say,
you know, if Lenny Bruce

1075
01:23:19,218 --> 01:23:22,020
or Miles Davis or Jimi
Hendrix didn't do drugs,

1076
01:23:22,021 --> 01:23:23,989
they would have done
so much better.

1077
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:25,924
Actually, I don't think
they would have done shit.

1078
01:23:25,925 --> 01:23:28,193
Tropisms.

1079
01:23:28,194 --> 01:23:31,129
You know, originally, I was going
to pursue a career in academia?

1080
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:34,531
I have a Master's degree in
Transnational Criminal Syndicates.

1081
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,068
Seriously.

1082
01:23:36,069 --> 01:23:38,670
My thesis was about
the relationship

1083
01:23:38,671 --> 01:23:40,606
between the yakuza
and ultranationalist

1084
01:23:40,607 --> 01:23:42,608
right-wing politics
in post-war Japan.

1085
01:23:42,609 --> 01:23:45,277
I was gonna be a professor.

1086
01:23:45,278 --> 01:23:48,280
Then, one day, I was watching
an episode of<i>Full House,</i>

1087
01:23:48,281 --> 01:23:50,382
where Jesse goes
bungee-jumping with Becky?

1088
01:23:50,383 --> 01:23:52,117
Changed my whole life.

1089
01:23:52,118 --> 01:23:56,922
I decided, "You know what?
I gotta take the plunge."

1090
01:23:56,923 --> 01:23:59,191
I don't want to sit on the
sidelines my whole life.

1091
01:23:59,192 --> 01:24:02,628
I don't want to teach,
I want to do.

1092
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:03,594
Let's go.

1093
01:24:05,864 --> 01:24:07,631
The big one's soon.

1094
01:24:09,635 --> 01:24:11,502
Caveat emptor.

1095
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:19,076
Jack...

1096
01:24:27,219 --> 01:24:28,420
I looked...
You looked in the bag.

1097
01:24:28,421 --> 01:24:30,487
In the bag...

1098
01:24:34,793 --> 01:24:36,961
Yeah.

1099
01:24:49,307 --> 01:24:51,575
You know we're gonna die.

1100
01:24:53,745 --> 01:24:55,747
God damn it!

1101
01:24:55,748 --> 01:24:58,048
Hey.

1102
01:24:59,785 --> 01:25:01,986
What, the bills
aren't crisp enough?

1103
01:25:03,355 --> 01:25:04,555
There's a problem.

1104
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:07,558
What's that?

1105
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,762
Cat looked in the bag.
I didn't know.

1106
01:25:13,131 --> 01:25:17,002
Jack, sometimes you disappoint
the hell out of me.

1107
01:25:17,003 --> 01:25:19,271
You got emotionally
involved with a whore?

1108
01:25:19,272 --> 01:25:21,171
Yeah.

1109
01:25:22,374 --> 01:25:23,475
She's not a whore.

1110
01:25:23,476 --> 01:25:24,876
All women are whores.

1111
01:25:24,877 --> 01:25:26,812
No, they're not.

1112
01:25:26,813 --> 01:25:28,914
Take care of your business,
Jack, right now.

1113
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:30,782
Okay. She's not a whore.

1114
01:25:30,783 --> 01:25:33,218
Shut your goddamn mouth!
You're making me sick.

1115
01:25:33,219 --> 01:25:36,121
Can I see the bag for a minute?
What?

1116
01:25:36,122 --> 01:25:37,322
I want to see what's in the bag.

1117
01:25:37,323 --> 01:25:39,324
For what?
I want to look inside.

1118
01:25:39,325 --> 01:25:41,259
Who do you think
you are talking to?

1119
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:44,162
You don't talk to me,
I talk to you.

1120
01:25:44,163 --> 01:25:47,197
You know what you have to do,
take care of business.

1121
01:26:18,797 --> 01:26:21,065
Jack.

1122
01:26:37,182 --> 01:26:38,816
Kill him.

1123
01:26:43,488 --> 01:26:45,157
I don't wanna leave you.

1124
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,824
I'll be right here.

1125
01:26:49,127 --> 01:26:50,661
Kill him.

1126
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:53,864
Here, take this.

1127
01:27:50,122 --> 01:27:53,590
Try and give the master
of the game a better game, Jack.

1128
01:28:10,475 --> 01:28:12,609
Jesus, Jack!

1129
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:20,318
You passed the Lizard
and Sheriff tests,

1130
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:21,919
but I'm out of your league, Jack.

1131
01:28:53,952 --> 01:28:56,553
I see you haven't
read Sunzi's<i>Art of War.</i>

1132
01:29:27,519 --> 01:29:28,919
Shot ya.

1133
01:29:44,069 --> 01:29:46,003
What's in the bag?

1134
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:48,740
It was a gift. You were
just too blind to see it.

1135
01:29:48,741 --> 01:29:50,241
What's in the fucking bag?

1136
01:29:50,242 --> 01:29:52,110
Oh, shut up.

1137
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:54,512
What's gonna happen now is you're
gonna throw your gun over here.

1138
01:29:54,513 --> 01:29:56,548
I'm gonna throw my gun over there?

1139
01:29:56,549 --> 01:29:58,616
The motel, my motel,

1140
01:29:58,617 --> 01:30:02,554
is rigged with enough C4 to wipe
it off the face of the Earth.

1141
01:30:02,555 --> 01:30:06,191
And in case you were
wondering what this is.

1142
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:10,195
It's a detonator. Not a coincidence.
Am I lying?

1143
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:12,263
I'm gonna count to three.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna count to two.

1144
01:30:12,264 --> 01:30:15,300
You wanna start, or should I?

1145
01:30:15,301 --> 01:30:19,237
You didn't leave your girlfriend
in the room there, did you?

1146
01:30:19,238 --> 01:30:22,073
You know, something tells
me you might have.

1147
01:30:22,074 --> 01:30:24,442
You just can't keep the
women in your life

1148
01:30:24,443 --> 01:30:26,843
from dying horrible,
violent deaths, can you?

1149
01:30:27,112 --> 01:30:28,446
I don't care about her.

1150
01:30:28,447 --> 01:30:30,682
I think you do care
about her, Jack.

1151
01:30:30,683 --> 01:30:32,517
That's your whole,
tragic thing here.

1152
01:30:32,518 --> 01:30:34,519
And by "tragic" I mean "pathetic."

1153
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,621
Tell me what's in the bag.
What's in the bag?

1154
01:30:39,124 --> 01:30:41,692
I think you have to
look for yourself.

1155
01:31:12,624 --> 01:31:15,660
They never recovered your fiance's
entire body, did they, Jack?

1156
01:31:15,661 --> 01:31:18,729
No leads, no clues.

1157
01:31:19,631 --> 01:31:21,998
She had no enemies.
She just had you.

1158
01:31:22,467 --> 01:31:25,370
I couldn't let my best man go.

1159
01:31:25,371 --> 01:31:29,240
In this business you are sui generis.
Absolutely unique.

1160
01:31:29,241 --> 01:31:30,642
Your word is your bond.

1161
01:31:30,643 --> 01:31:33,211
Your fiance was taking
you away from me.

1162
01:31:33,212 --> 01:31:35,447
I couldn't allow that.

1163
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:38,283
I told you I'd find the guy who
did it and bring him to you.

1164
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:41,852
It took me a little time, but
I'm also a man of my word.

1165
01:31:43,388 --> 01:31:45,389
Here I am.

1166
01:31:47,225 --> 01:31:49,427
You know,

1167
01:31:49,428 --> 01:31:51,830
I'm doing you a favor by putting
you out of your misery. Trust me.

1168
01:31:51,831 --> 01:31:54,099
Six divorces and eight kids later,

1169
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,667
I'll tell you one thing as
sure as the day you die.

1170
01:31:55,668 --> 01:31:57,901
A woman will always let you down.

1171
01:32:13,485 --> 01:32:15,519
Was that your good hand?

1172
01:32:16,254 --> 01:32:17,889
What are the odds?

1173
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:20,757
You could have been a
multi-multimillionaire...

1174
01:32:21,659 --> 01:32:23,727
- Or at least a contender.
- Drop it.

1175
01:32:24,163 --> 01:32:27,532
Turn around and face me,
you piece of trash.

1176
01:32:27,533 --> 01:32:30,869
Oh, you wouldn't shoot a man
in the back, would you?

1177
01:32:30,870 --> 01:32:33,671
A man, no, but you're not a man.

1178
01:32:33,672 --> 01:32:35,473
I know you.
Shoot him.

1179
01:32:35,474 --> 01:32:38,143
More important is that I know you.

1180
01:32:38,144 --> 01:32:40,111
What are you doing in
public without your horns?

1181
01:32:40,112 --> 01:32:41,913
- Shoot him!
- Horns? That's a good one.

1182
01:32:41,914 --> 01:32:43,781
And just what the fuck are you?

1183
01:32:43,782 --> 01:32:45,850
I'm the one who's dealt
with evil all my life.

1184
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:47,619
That's a little dramatic.
Not...

1185
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,354
Shoot him!

1186
01:33:08,907 --> 01:33:12,709
If you want me to live,
clap your hands.

1187
01:33:16,281 --> 01:33:18,048
I didn't hear anything.

1188
01:34:07,832 --> 01:34:10,133
It is time to go, Jack.

1189
01:36:04,015 --> 01:36:06,851
Closure.

1190
01:36:06,852 --> 01:36:09,487
I should just mind my
own business, huh?

1191
01:36:09,488 --> 01:36:11,489
If you did, I'd be dead.

1192
01:36:11,490 --> 01:36:12,757
It's true. It's true.

1193
01:36:12,758 --> 01:36:14,224
It is true.

1194
01:36:16,728 --> 01:36:18,261
You are one tough Hebrew.

1195
01:36:19,731 --> 01:36:21,931
You have no idea.

1196
01:36:21,999 --> 01:36:22,799
Mmm.

1197
01:36:24,035 --> 01:36:26,936
Maybe we should go to a hospital.

1198
01:36:27,772 --> 01:36:29,339
You think?

1199
01:36:29,707 --> 01:36:31,676
Just a thought.

1200
01:37:00,438 --> 01:37:03,007
You lawyers have nice offices.

1201
01:37:03,008 --> 01:37:05,476
Thank you very much.
Come and sit down.

1202
01:37:05,477 --> 01:37:07,545
You look like you've been in a war.

1203
01:37:07,546 --> 01:37:09,580
You could say so.

1204
01:37:09,581 --> 01:37:13,818
I'm lucky to have good doctors whose
specialty's not asking questions.

1205
01:37:13,819 --> 01:37:15,653
There's a lot of tidying up to do.

1206
01:37:15,654 --> 01:37:17,954
I suggest we make a start.

1207
01:37:25,129 --> 01:37:28,433
You mentioned something on
the phone about a motel.

1208
01:37:28,434 --> 01:37:29,767
A motel where?

1209
01:37:29,768 --> 01:37:31,636
Louisiana, the bayou.

1210
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:34,439
You'll like it down there.
It's hot.

1211
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:37,642
And hook up with
some guy named Jack?

1212
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:42,979
You make sure that this Jack
still has what it takes.

1213
01:37:43,915 --> 01:37:47,050
You fuck with his head,
you understand?

1214
01:37:49,086 --> 01:37:51,722
You're gonna have to
have some play dates

1215
01:37:51,723 --> 01:37:54,192
with the local boys
to pull this off.

1216
01:37:54,193 --> 01:37:56,761
No one's gonna know who the hell
you are or who you work for.

1217
01:37:56,762 --> 01:37:58,095
You're on your own down there.

1218
01:37:58,096 --> 01:37:59,462
Wonderful.

1219
01:38:00,198 --> 01:38:03,100
What's so important about this guy?

1220
01:38:03,101 --> 01:38:05,670
There are people in
my life who I trust,

1221
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:08,105
and there are people
in my life who can kill.

1222
01:38:08,106 --> 01:38:10,074
But there aren't any
killers I trust

1223
01:38:10,075 --> 01:38:12,009
other than Jack,
but I'm not so sure anymore.

1224
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:13,711
I think the guy's gone
soft in the head.

1225
01:38:13,712 --> 01:38:16,714
And he's probably gone
soft in the dick too.

1226
01:38:16,715 --> 01:38:20,483
So I would like you
to overexert him.

1227
01:38:21,786 --> 01:38:24,589
I could save you a lot
of time and trouble.

1228
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:27,390
Whatever you need
Jack for I can handle.

1229
01:38:29,094 --> 01:38:31,629
Now, if only that were true.

1230
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:35,431
Unfortunately,
my six-foot chameleon,

1231
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,735
it isn't.

1232
01:38:37,736 --> 01:38:40,303
Well, he better be cute then.

1233
01:38:41,906 --> 01:38:43,774
I think he looks like a fucking,

1234
01:38:43,775 --> 01:38:45,543
average chipmunk,
but what do I know?

1235
01:38:45,544 --> 01:38:48,813
One thing I do know,
the guy's a killing machine.

1236
01:38:48,814 --> 01:38:50,180
But he's a sap.

1237
01:38:50,948 --> 01:38:53,017
So I want you to give him the whole

1238
01:38:53,018 --> 01:38:55,553
Jack-I've-gotten-myself-
into-so-much-trouble

1239
01:38:55,554 --> 01:38:57,822
can-you-please-help-me-out routine.

1240
01:38:57,823 --> 01:39:00,558
That I can do.

1241
01:39:00,559 --> 01:39:02,458
And, baby...

1242
01:39:03,294 --> 01:39:06,030
And, baby, if this gets fucked up,

1243
01:39:06,031 --> 01:39:10,768
this goes South or something
goes wrong and I die,

1244
01:39:10,769 --> 01:39:13,403
I want you to snuff Jack.

1245
01:39:14,839 --> 01:39:16,941
Kill him?

1246
01:39:16,942 --> 01:39:21,879
In the unlikely event that this
guy somehow manages to kill me,

1247
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:24,181
which would actually prove
that he's considerably more

1248
01:39:24,182 --> 01:39:26,884
capable than I suspect
he is at this point,

1249
01:39:26,885 --> 01:39:29,587
I would want you to kill him.

1250
01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:32,156
You know I'd avenge your death
just out of love, right?

1251
01:39:32,157 --> 01:39:35,358
But a girl's gotta make a living.

1252
01:39:37,228 --> 01:39:40,230
Don't worry, along with love,
you'll get $5 million.

1253
01:39:41,666 --> 01:39:44,635
And you'll disappear, and
you'll live a long, sweet life.

1254
01:39:44,636 --> 01:39:47,971
And you'll remember me when you
say your prayers at night.

1255
01:39:50,241 --> 01:39:52,777
Go to my lawyer with
proof of Jack's death.

1256
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:55,313
He's a fucking stickler for detail.

1257
01:39:55,314 --> 01:39:57,715
Come to think of it,
you might wanna

1258
01:39:57,716 --> 01:39:59,916
consider bringing him
Jack's head in a bag.

1259
01:40:02,853 --> 01:40:05,957
Come on, Mr. Fucking-
stickler-for-detail.

1260
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:07,957
Let's you and me go for a ride.

1261
01:40:08,893 --> 01:40:12,797
A ride? Where?

1262
01:40:12,798 --> 01:40:15,066
Do I look like the
kind of girl who would

1263
01:40:15,067 --> 01:40:17,367
walk around with a
human head in a bag?

1264
01:40:20,004 --> 01:40:21,905
It's a little hard to say.

1265
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:28,079
You do look like a pretty tough
girl and you must have been

1266
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,715
to have outlasted
both Jack and Dragna.

1267
01:40:30,716 --> 01:40:32,750
You have no idea.

1268
01:40:32,751 --> 01:40:35,186
Well, I have some idea that
you weren't a Girl Guide.

1269
01:40:35,187 --> 01:40:37,086
I'm gonna be your tour guide.

1270
01:40:41,325 --> 01:40:43,226
Are you crazy?

1271
01:40:43,794 --> 01:40:45,194
I've been called worse.

1272
01:40:45,997 --> 01:40:48,564
Come on.
Enough talk, let's go!

1273
01:40:51,402 --> 01:40:54,905
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

1274
01:40:54,906 --> 01:40:57,073
Let's just cut to the chase.

1275
01:40:59,944 --> 01:41:04,148
You look like the sort of girl who
is going to be more than happy

1276
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:10,988
to carry $5 million in
cash and gold bullion.

1277
01:41:10,989 --> 01:41:13,489
I didn't know I was
that transparent.

1278
01:41:18,996 --> 01:41:21,497
You got room in that bag?
Oh, yeah.

1279
01:41:36,313 --> 01:41:38,381
Nice doing business with you.

1280
01:41:39,784 --> 01:41:44,687
You might wanna take what you've
left implanted in my wall.

1281
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:47,023
Keep it.

1282
01:41:47,391 --> 01:41:49,258
Fair exchange.

1283
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,327
See you.
