"Every day when one's body
and mind are at peace,

00:10:06,682 --> 00:10:09,362
I'll get you
the rest tomorrow.

11
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:12,001
No problem.

12
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:04,167
'Listen, Frank...

13
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,962
'Don't fuck around
with the boss's daughter. '

14
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:09,722
'Don't break my balls,
Uncle Joe. '

15
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:11,567

00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:15,162
'She's been in and out
of psychiatric hospitals.

00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:17,447
- 'She's a wacko. '
- 'Yeah, yeah... '

18
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:20,462
'Vargo has put the
family money in her trust fund. '

19
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:23,442
'I already know. '
'You'll get clipped. '

20
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:25,647
Are you finished yet, Uncle Joe?

21
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:29,047
- 'You'll get whacked!'
- I'm not fu...

22
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:33,802
I'm not fucking dead yet, so
let's get off the goddamn phone.

23
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:37,887
'Are you listening?
That girl's a fucking wacko. '

24
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:41,167
'Yeah, I know. '
'Vargo's crazy about her.

25
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:45,602
- 'You know what "crazy" means?'
- 'Yeah, I know, Uncle Joe. '

26
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:04,527
Excuse me, Mr Vargo. Sonny...

27
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:07,562
Louie Bonacelli's outside,
said you told him to come.

28
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:10,247
Thanks, Angie.

29
00:12:10,282 --> 00:12:14,527
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- OK.

30
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:17,862
- I almost hit the number.
- What did you play?

31
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:21,162
I played my license plate
number. You know what?

32
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:23,522
My fucking house-address number
came out!

33
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:28,677
Hey...

34
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:33,680
- Louie.
- What's up, Sonny?

35
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:40,358
Come on,
let's take a walk.

36
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:44,287
- Everything's set up?
- Yeah.

37
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:47,951
It's going down tonight.
I'm using my special guy.

38
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:51,487
What about the girl?

39
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:54,802
Morini put her on the bus...
to the seashore.

40
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:58,287
- Good.
- I don't feel good about it.

41
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:02,522
Handsome Frank's a made guy
and all. A good soldier.

42
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:06,767
- I feel a little bad.
- Forget about it.

43
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:11,122
Handsome Frank fucked up. Pay
your respects at the funeral.

44
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,238
Yeah...

45
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:43,807
'Home in!'

46
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:48,233
'One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven. '

47
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,592
Have some more wine, Louise.

48
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:01,442
I don't want any more wine.

49
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,207
What the fuck?

50
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,402
What do you want? My Rolex?
Whatever...

51
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,833
Did my father
send you here to do this?

52
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,278
It's a good book.

53
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:11,041
Ancient Japan
was a pretty strange place.

54
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:17,033
You can have it.
I'm finished with it.

55
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:02,156
I've got a bad feeling, Vin.

56
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:12,082
First Valerio calls me in for
a sit-down with Vargo himself.

57
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,959
And now the bird.

58
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,801
Here, birdy-birdy.
Come here, you little fucker.

59
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:25,802
Goddammit, this is ridiculous.

60
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:28,600
I can't write this small.

61
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:35,282
Can't we swag a fax
machine and get it to this guy?

62
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:36,962
It ain't the Middle Ages.

63
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,271
Come here, birdy.

64
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:46,833
I got him, Louie! Louie,
I got him. I got the sucker.

65
00:16:50,082 --> 00:16:52,856
Little fucker, here we go.

66
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:55,630
Easy now, Mr Chicken, easy.

67
00:17:02,002 --> 00:17:04,682
Mother of Jesus, Vin,
hold it still!

68
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,877
I don't want to hurt him.

69
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:09,037
- Ready?
- Yeah, OK.

70
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:14,276
Go home,
little birdy, go home.

71
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,162
'Shit! Shit!'

72
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,480
'What's going on?
What's the problem here?'

73
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:58,020
You little brat!
You want us to come up there?

74
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:01,398
Fuck you!
Then you gonna get it!

75
00:21:03,802 --> 00:21:06,202
- You little prick!
- Eat me!

76
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:07,847
Cocksucker.

77
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:11,367
Hey, Louie. What the fuck
are you guys doing?

78
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:15,873
His mother went to work and
locked him in. He's mad as hell.

79
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:24,442
Vargo's waiting for us. You've
got bigger problems than this.

80
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:28,842
Johnny, you said the girl was
on the fucking bus last night.

81
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:32,007
- What happened?
- She was.

82
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,522
I don't know what happened.
Let's go.

83
00:21:34,557 --> 00:21:36,558
Come on, Vin, let's go.

84
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:15,078
- Ghost Dog!
- Knowledge to knowledge, baby.

85
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:43,558
Shit!

86
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:20,071
How you doin'? How are you?
They're inside, waiting for you.

87
00:23:23,722 --> 00:23:27,635
- Condolences on Handsome Frank.
- Thank you.

88
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:33,834
- My thoughts are with you, Joe.
- They're waiting for you.

89
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:43,642
- I'm sorry about Frank.
- Thank you.

90
00:23:43,677 --> 00:23:46,687
Sorry about your nephew, kid.

91
00:23:46,722 --> 00:23:50,282
They whacked him.
What are you gonna do?

92
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:52,477
That's the way it goes.

93
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:07,882
- Hey. Go in, they're waiting.
- Thanks.

94
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:09,922
Louie, how's it going?

95
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:21,127
I'm sorry we're late, Mr Vargo.

96
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:24,199
Mr Bonacelli was...
delayed on his way over.

97
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,559
Sit down.

98
00:24:37,082 --> 00:24:39,962
Johnny,
step outside, have a smoke.

99
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:42,874
Sure, Sonny.
Mr Vargo.

100
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:51,207
We got a big problem here.

101
00:24:51,242 --> 00:24:55,682
Seems like you're responsible.
Your mystery man fucked up.

102
00:24:55,717 --> 00:24:59,139
Morini told me
he put the girl...

103
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:02,527
.. Mr Vargo's daughter,
on the bus.

104
00:25:02,562 --> 00:25:05,882
He did... but she got off and
went to Handsome Frank's house.

105
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:10,916
You wanted Handsome Frank
whacked... So he got whacked.

106
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:15,915
From outside. I set it all up.
No traces, no nothing.

107
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:22,207
Morini said
that she was on the bus.

108
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:26,554
Jesus, it's lucky
he didn't do her, too. Right?

109
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:31,471
If he had,
you would be fucking dead.

110
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:38,282
- This is not a good situation.
- Where is she? Is she OK?

111
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:40,647
Don't worry
about Mr Vargo's daughter.

112
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:44,247
We need to eliminate
the scumbag who whacked Frank.

113
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:50,122
Frank was one of us. His killer
needs to be... neutralised.

114
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,714
Erased from the planet.

115
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:57,602
For the past four years, he's
done maybe 12 perfect contracts.

116
00:25:57,637 --> 00:26:00,127
Perfect. Like a ghost.

117
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:03,727
He's valuable.
Totally untraceable.

118
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:09,642
If he'd realised anyone would
be there, he'd have backed off.

119
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:13,159
He sure didn't know
that she was gonna... be there.

120
00:26:13,194 --> 00:26:16,238
Louie, unless you wanna
be buried next to Frank,

121
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:19,282
tell us everything about
this mysterious, ghostlike,

122
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:21,671
untraceable
fuckin' button man.

123
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:25,862
OK, OK. Er, let's see...

124
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:28,967
I don't pay him by the job.

125
00:26:29,002 --> 00:26:34,202
He'll only work if I pay once a
year on the first day of autumn.

126
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:38,400
First day of autumn, I settle up
for that past year, see?

127
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:46,087
The first day of autumn...
OK, OK.

128
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:49,847
Let's skip that part.
Where does he live?

129
00:26:49,882 --> 00:26:52,807
Fucked if I know.
That's the next strange thing.

130
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:57,836
I can't call him. He contacts me
only through a bird.

131
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:03,562
Since I first started
contracting stuff out to him,

132
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:05,562
the bird comes every single day.

133
00:27:05,597 --> 00:27:08,047
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

134
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:11,362
Did you say he contacts you
through a fucking bird?

135
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:13,080
Did I just hear that?

136
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:19,035
What particular
species... of bird?

137
00:27:20,602 --> 00:27:24,802
It's a pigeon. It must be
a carrier pigeon or whatever.

138
00:27:24,837 --> 00:27:30,962
Passenger pigeon!
They've been extinct since 1914!

139
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:33,767
Am I fucking dreaming here
or what?

140
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:39,162
OK, Louie, forget about
the bird. Let me ask you this.

141
00:27:39,197 --> 00:27:44,522
Tell me, what does
this mysterious guy look like?

142
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:47,958
He's a big guy.
A big black guy.

143
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:52,951
- He's what?
- He said the guy's a nigger!

144
00:27:54,482 --> 00:27:58,762
Maybe eight years ago,
I saw a guy, this guy.

145
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:01,682
'He was a kid
in a bad situation. '

146
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:04,322
Stupid-ass
motherfucker!

147
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:06,279
Get his ass up here!

148
00:28:06,314 --> 00:28:08,167
You motherfucker!

149
00:28:08,202 --> 00:28:10,727
What's the problem here?

150
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:16,041
'So I...
straightened things out. '

151
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:30,802
Anyway, about four years ago,
this big guy comes to my door.

152
00:28:30,837 --> 00:28:34,539
This black guy, got a fucking
pigeon on his shoulder.

153
00:28:34,574 --> 00:28:38,207
Fuck knows how he found me,
but he said he owed me.

154
00:28:38,242 --> 00:28:44,522
I only saw him once after that
and we made this arrangement.

155
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,807
That's very touching, Louie.

156
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:50,327
Let me just backtrack
for a second.

157
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:55,322
The bird comes to your house
every day. Did he come today?

158
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:58,082
Yes, the bird
was there this morning.

159
00:28:58,117 --> 00:29:00,207
Did he have a message?

160
00:29:00,242 --> 00:29:04,061
The usual
"mission accomplished" message.

161
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:07,881
Uh-huh. And did you
send a message back?

162
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:10,480
No.

163
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:17,282
You'd called me in, so I figured
it was best to leave it alone.

164
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:19,034
Did you follow this bird?

165
00:29:20,682 --> 00:29:24,207
Put a bug on it?
Anything like that?

166
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:29,487
No, I never had a reason
to do anything like that.

167
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:34,762
I realise the arrangement I made
with this guy is pretty weird,

168
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:38,442
but he's always
shown me complete respect.

169
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,967
A whole new century
is coming,

170
00:29:41,002 --> 00:29:44,182
and Mr Vargo wants
every member of this family

171
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:47,362
to make it a priority
to erase this weirdo.

172
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:50,207
This guy is a professional.

173
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:52,962
Going after him
could be dangerous.

174
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:55,087
Handsome Frank was one of us,

175
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:58,114
so we're gonna peel
this nigger's cap back.

176
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:03,992
Better him than you, right?

177
00:30:08,762 --> 00:30:11,842
Now, what the fuck
is his name?

178
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:14,834
- Ghost Dog.
- What?

179
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:20,075
- Ghost Dog.
- Ghost Dog?

180
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:25,822
- He said Ghost Dog!
- He calls himself Ghost Dog.

181
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:30,122
A lot of these black guys,
gangster type guys,

182
00:30:30,157 --> 00:30:32,167
they all got names like that.

183
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:36,327
- Is that true?
- He means like the rappers.

184
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:39,802
The rappers got names
like that - Snoop Doggy Dogg,

185
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,647
Ice Cube, Q-Tip, Method Man.

186
00:30:41,682 --> 00:30:44,522
My favourite was always
Flavor Flav from Public Enemy.

187
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:46,367
He got the funky
fresh fly flava.

188
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:49,207
"Live lyrics
from the bank of reality.

189
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:52,442
"I kick da flyest dope manoeuvre
technicality, to a dope track. "

190
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:55,002
- I love that guy.
- I know nothing about that,

191
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:57,607
but it makes me
think about Indians.

192
00:30:57,642 --> 00:31:02,242
They've got names
like Red Cloud, Crazy Horse,

193
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:06,082
Running Bear, Black Elk...

194
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:17,196
- That kind of shit.
- Indians, niggers... same thing!

195
00:31:20,282 --> 00:31:24,447
- Johnny!
- Sonny? Mr Vargo?

196
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:28,002
Go outside. Get Sammy the Snake,
Joe Rags, Big Angie.

197
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:30,960
- Get 'em in here.
- Right away.

198
00:33:29,522 --> 00:33:31,001
Yes!

199
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:45,680
Hey! Peace, Dog!

200
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:22,607
Is that your dog?

201
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:27,762
No. I thought
maybe it was your dog.

202
00:35:37,882 --> 00:35:39,474
What?

203
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,407
What?

204
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,287
He's really staring at you.

205
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:49,076
- Maybe he wants my ice cream.
- I don't think so.

206
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:06,155
If he's bothering you,
why not tell him to go away?

207
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:10,436
Go on.

208
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:16,527
I've seen you before...

209
00:36:16,562 --> 00:36:19,287
'cause you always carry
that briefcase.

210
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:23,042
You live on the roof
of the building down from me,

211
00:36:23,077 --> 00:36:25,767
where the birds
fly out from.

212
00:36:25,802 --> 00:36:31,402
Mom says you talk to nobody
and you got no friends.

213
00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:34,322
- I don't know your mom.
- Is it true?

214
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:35,647
What?

215
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:39,402
You never talk to nobody
and you got no friends.

216
00:36:39,437 --> 00:36:42,762
- No, I'm talking to you, right?
- Yeah.

217
00:36:42,797 --> 00:36:45,674
Right.

218
00:36:56,802 --> 00:36:59,567
You got your lunch
in that box?

219
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:03,722
- What you got in the briefcase?
- I asked you first.

220
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:06,847
No. Not my lunch.

221
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:10,082
I got my books.
You wanna see?

222
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:12,721
Books? Yeah, OK.

223
00:37:16,242 --> 00:37:18,682
"The Wind in the Willows".

224
00:37:18,717 --> 00:37:19,927
I read that.

225
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:21,807
- You did?
- Yeah.

226
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:25,232
Toad Hall and that stuff.
It was great.

227
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:28,393
You did read it.

228
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:33,273
"The Souls of Black Folk".

229
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:38,322
I read that, too.
Where did you get that?

230
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:41,087
From Ms Andrews, my teacher.

231
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:45,042
I didn't read all of it,
but I plan to.

232
00:37:45,077 --> 00:37:46,919
You got time.

233
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:52,117
"Night Nurse"?!

234
00:37:56,762 --> 00:38:01,122
- You read that?
- No, I just like the cover.

235
00:38:01,157 --> 00:38:03,317
Right...

236
00:38:06,642 --> 00:38:09,487
"Frankenstein".
That's a good book.

237
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:13,722
- Yeah, better than the movie.
- You thought so, too?

238
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,127
Yeah.

239
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:18,120
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

240
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:25,727
"He sprung from the cabin window

241
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:31,962
"upon the ice raft,
which lay close to the vessel.

242
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:35,819
"He was soon borne away
by the waves,

243
00:38:35,854 --> 00:38:39,607
"and lost in darkness...
and distance. "

244
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:43,762
Hey, that's the end!
Don't give away the ending.

245
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:47,835
"The monster... Frankenstein. "

246
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:05,602
"Rashomon". What's this about?

247
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,967
Pearline?

248
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:10,367
You can borrow that.

249
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:13,522
You just gotta promise
that when you read it,

250
00:39:13,557 --> 00:39:15,842
you come tell me
what you think.

251
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:17,195
OK, I will.

252
00:39:21,202 --> 00:39:24,433
Is it true you got
no friends, then?

253
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:30,887
No. My best friend's
right over there.

254
00:39:30,922 --> 00:39:34,642
- You wanna meet my best friend?
- I don't see anybody.

255
00:39:34,677 --> 00:39:37,762
He's there
in that ice cream truck.

256
00:39:37,797 --> 00:39:40,087
What do you think, I'm a chump?

257
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:42,920
I'm not going there.
I hardly know you.

258
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:45,556
Whatever.

259
00:39:48,482 --> 00:39:51,127
Well, all right.

260
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:53,807
Pearline,
where are you going?

261
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:57,960
I'm going to get ice cream.
I'm coming right back.

262
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:24,642
This is my best friend, Raymond.
Raymond, this is...

263
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:26,633
- Pearline, right?
- Yeah.

264
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:35,312
My best friend.

265
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:48,807
Well, OK. Thanks.

266
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:51,242
Chocolate's my favourite.

267
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:53,472
Yeah. Me, too.

268
00:41:02,562 --> 00:41:06,767
- What language is he talking?
- French.

269
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:10,322
- He only speaks French.
- Do you understand French?

270
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:14,076
No. I never understand
a word he says.

271
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:20,633
- And that's your best friend?
- Yeah.

272
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:35,871
- Bears?
- Yes! Bravo!

273
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:09,637
- What's he talking about?
- Bears, I guess.

274
00:42:13,122 --> 00:42:17,479
I gotta go. I got
some business to take care of.

275
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:29,158
For the ice cream.

276
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:38,122
That book, read it and tell me
what you think, OK?

277
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:39,687
- OK.
- OK.

278
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:41,838
Take it easy, Raymond.

279
00:43:32,322 --> 00:43:35,287
That fucking thing loaded?

280
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:38,042
- Yeah, OK.
- Come on, let's do it.

281
00:43:38,077 --> 00:43:39,316
Ready?

282
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:46,282
That could be him right there.
Should I shoot him?

283
00:43:46,317 --> 00:43:49,322
No, that ain't him.
Vargo said it was a black guy.

284
00:43:49,357 --> 00:43:51,767
So, what's he?
What are you, Puerto Rican?

285
00:43:51,802 --> 00:43:55,841
- I think he's an Indian.
- What the hell are you?

286
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:02,637
Cayuga.

287
00:44:04,002 --> 00:44:06,847
Cayuga? What the fuck
is Cayuga?

288
00:44:06,882 --> 00:44:09,442
Puerto Rican,
indian, nigger... same thing.

289
00:44:09,477 --> 00:44:12,207
We should
waste him to be sure.

290
00:44:12,242 --> 00:44:17,316
It ain't authorised, so let's
go. I wanna get the right guy.

291
00:44:25,602 --> 00:44:28,116
- Stupid fucking white man.
- What?

292
00:44:29,242 --> 00:44:31,967
I said stupid fucking white man.

293
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,002
You red nigger-looking
Sitting Bullshit motherfucker!

294
00:44:35,037 --> 00:44:38,002
Sam, you're losing control.
Let's get out of here.

295
00:44:38,037 --> 00:44:39,367
Cayuga, my ass!

296
00:44:39,402 --> 00:44:42,767
You better learn to keep
your fucking mouth shut,

297
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:47,114
or I'll blow your fucking brains
out myself. You dumb fuck!

298
00:46:56,802 --> 00:47:00,841
Hey, what the heck
is going on, fellas?

299
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,318
What? What?

300
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:18,367
Ah, shit!
I don't think that's him.

301
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:22,402
- How the hell do you know?
- It doesn't feel right.

302
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:26,699
Now he's got his own wings,
he can fly with his pigeons.

303
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:30,907
Vargo said, if he even looks
like him, shoot him, right?

304
00:47:30,942 --> 00:47:35,080
I know. Let's go. I gotta take
care of something for Sonny.

305
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:18,199
Fuck. I knew
that was gonna be you.

306
00:49:28,322 --> 00:49:32,122
You gonna kill me?
You might as well kill me.

307
00:49:32,157 --> 00:49:35,379
I'm your retainer.
I follow a code.

308
00:49:35,414 --> 00:49:38,567
I've always
given you my respect.

309
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:42,522
That's why you've got that
big fucking gun to my head?

310
00:49:42,557 --> 00:49:47,127
Forgive me. I don't
mean you no disrespect.

311
00:49:47,162 --> 00:49:51,202
- How the fuck did you find me?
- Called me for a meeting.

312
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:53,591
Yeah.

313
00:49:54,962 --> 00:49:58,802
Everything seems
to be changing all around us.

314
00:49:58,837 --> 00:50:00,872
You can say that again.

315
00:50:02,882 --> 00:50:07,162
When you did that guy the other
night, was a girl there?

316
00:50:07,197 --> 00:50:09,202
I wasn't instructed
to eliminate her.

317
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:12,567
I know,
it's just that...

318
00:50:12,602 --> 00:50:16,561
things have gotten
all complicated now.

319
00:50:20,002 --> 00:50:22,327
They're gonna whack you,
Ghost Dog.

320
00:50:22,362 --> 00:50:25,922
If they don't find you,
they're gonna whack me instead.

321
00:50:25,957 --> 00:50:28,962
- Probably whack me anyways.
- Ray Vargo?

322
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:31,087
The whole family's
looking for you.

323
00:50:31,122 --> 00:50:35,942
- The underboss, Valerio, too?
- Of course. He pulls all the...

324
00:50:35,977 --> 00:50:40,762
Hey... How the fuck do you know
so much about our organisation?

325
00:50:40,797 --> 00:50:43,207
- Who was the girl?
- She's...

326
00:50:43,242 --> 00:50:46,862
Forget about her,
I can't talk about that.

327
00:50:46,897 --> 00:50:50,629
I'm warning you
that they're gonna kill you.

328
00:50:50,664 --> 00:50:54,853
- Maybe me, too.
- Better me than you, Louie.

329
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:59,042
Well... Right now,
I'd have to agree with that.

330
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:02,273
Hey, Louie!
Sorry I'm late...

331
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:05,470
and I'm real sorry
about this.

332
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:12,527
Jesus Christ!
You just shot Morini.

333
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:15,420
Valerio's fucking
brother-in-law!

334
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:18,279
- He was gonna shoot you.
- What?

335
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:22,075
See if he's dead.

336
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:35,282
I don't think
he's getting any older.

337
00:51:35,317 --> 00:51:37,000
Roll him over.

338
00:51:47,362 --> 00:51:50,160
Now you really better shoot me.

339
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,991
There's no way
I'm gonna explain this.

340
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:59,687
Fuckin' Morini!

341
00:51:59,722 --> 00:52:03,447
OK, shoot me.
Go ahead, kill me now.

342
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:07,562
I'm your retainer. It's against
the code of the samurai.

343
00:52:07,597 --> 00:52:10,922
If you're my retainer,
whatever that is,

344
00:52:10,957 --> 00:52:13,282
then do what I tell you!

345
00:52:13,317 --> 00:52:14,635
Oww!

346
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:22,000
- What did you that for?
- You told me to.

347
00:52:24,202 --> 00:52:26,158
I don't
mean you no disrespect.

348
00:52:28,122 --> 00:52:32,161
Now you've got an excuse.
Tell them I attacked you both.

349
00:52:34,562 --> 00:52:38,087
You better watch your back,
Ghost Dog!

350
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:43,799
Like you said, everything
seems to be changing around us.

351
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:51,712
Nothing makes sense any more.

352
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,282
I'm gonna take your knight.

353
00:53:39,762 --> 00:53:42,799
Talking about ice cream?

354
00:54:45,242 --> 00:54:47,233
It's amazing.

355
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:53,279
How the hell is he
gonna get it down from here?

356
00:55:10,762 --> 00:55:11,956
Ah...

357
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:27,842
I gotta go.
I got business to take care of.

358
00:55:27,877 --> 00:55:29,992
The sun's coming down.

359
00:58:39,602 --> 00:58:41,832
Yeah.

360
00:58:43,882 --> 00:58:47,242
There is something
you could do for me.

361
00:58:48,642 --> 00:58:51,031
Yeah.

362
00:59:57,202 --> 01:00:01,282
'And now,
my newest invention. '

363
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:09,042
'I can turn diamonds...
into jelly beans!

364
01:00:09,077 --> 01:00:12,887
'But do you think I'm happy?

365
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:18,722
'No! I'm frustrated, frustrated,
frustrated, frustrated!

366
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:24,082
'You ask why? Felix the Cat
and his bag of tricks.

367
01:00:24,117 --> 01:00:29,082
- 'It's magic!'
- 'I'll make a canoe. '

368
01:00:29,117 --> 01:00:31,152
'Magic and more magic!'

369
01:00:41,482 --> 01:00:44,922
I thought
we discussed this yesterday.

370
01:00:44,957 --> 01:00:47,287
All I want is my money.

371
01:00:47,322 --> 01:00:51,522
There's people here. We
can discuss this another time.

372
01:00:51,557 --> 01:00:55,842
Every time
I have to come get my rent.

373
01:00:55,877 --> 01:00:57,927
It's every three months.

374
01:00:57,962 --> 01:01:00,920
'I'll try to
get the bag like this!'

375
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:09,647
'It tickles!'

376
01:01:09,682 --> 01:01:12,402
Sanchez,
I've got bigger problems.

377
01:01:12,437 --> 01:01:14,367
I'll clear it up tomorrow.

378
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:18,602
Pay me that money
or I'll call the City Marshal.

379
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:21,807
Three months rent!

380
01:01:21,842 --> 01:01:25,801
What kind of operation are
you guys running here anyway?

381
01:02:02,642 --> 01:02:04,727
What? What?

382
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:08,442
I don't think the boss
buys your story, either.

383
01:02:08,477 --> 01:02:12,959
Morini was family.
He was also my brother-in-law.

384
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:17,442
Sonny, I'm sad about
what happened, but I got shot!

385
01:02:17,477 --> 01:02:19,687
You think
I'm making this up?

386
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:23,397
I don't know
what I fucking believe!

387
01:02:30,882 --> 01:02:34,962
Joe, Snake. Go to the garage,
get some cars.

388
01:02:34,997 --> 01:02:37,722
First thing tomorrow,
take Mr Vargo

389
01:02:37,757 --> 01:02:40,207
to his castle in the woods.

390
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:43,282
- Right now?
- No, next fucking week!

391
01:02:43,317 --> 01:02:45,512
Let's go!

392
01:02:51,442 --> 01:02:53,558
Passenger pigeon!

393
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:58,074
Somebody grab
the goddamn thing!

394
01:03:00,162 --> 01:03:02,582
- Grab him, Vinny.
- Yeah.

395
01:03:02,617 --> 01:03:04,967
I got him. Here you go.

396
01:03:05,002 --> 01:03:07,781
Get out
with that flying rat.

397
01:03:07,816 --> 01:03:10,560
Just get the message off him.

398
01:03:14,802 --> 01:03:17,270
Send him home, Vinny.

399
01:03:34,322 --> 01:03:38,522
It says, "If a samurai's head
were to be suddenly cut off,

400
01:03:38,557 --> 01:03:42,722
"he should still be able
to perform one more action...

401
01:03:42,757 --> 01:03:45,555
"with certainty. "

402
01:03:47,322 --> 01:03:51,322
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

403
01:03:51,357 --> 01:03:52,927
It's poetry.

404
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:55,760
The poetry of war.

405
01:07:23,922 --> 01:07:26,127
Excuse me, excuse me!

406
01:07:26,162 --> 01:07:28,756
Step into
the alley, please!

407
01:08:23,922 --> 01:08:26,442
OK!

408
01:12:38,602 --> 01:12:40,399
Plan B.

409
01:13:23,562 --> 01:13:26,562
Hello, I'm Bob Solo.
I'm with West Side Realty.

410
01:13:26,597 --> 01:13:29,219
I have an appointment
with Mr Vargo.

411
01:13:29,254 --> 01:13:31,842
How did you
get in the gate, Mr Solo?

412
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:34,407
Mr Valerio gave me the code.

413
01:13:34,442 --> 01:13:38,242
It's very important. I may have
a buyer for the estate.

414
01:13:38,277 --> 01:13:41,376
Go inside, Sammy.
Check this out.

415
01:13:41,411 --> 01:13:44,476
I'll stay here
with our Mr Solo.

416
01:13:47,082 --> 01:13:49,287
Mind if I stretch my legs?

417
01:13:49,322 --> 01:13:52,762
No, you stay in the car,
Mr Solo.

418
01:13:52,797 --> 01:13:54,639
OK.

419
01:13:57,522 --> 01:14:00,594
Why don't I
give you my card?

420
01:14:02,002 --> 01:14:03,435
Jeez...

421
01:14:07,202 --> 01:14:08,999
You sonofa...

422
01:14:16,522 --> 01:14:18,274
Sonofabitch!

423
01:14:53,562 --> 01:14:56,562
Jesus, it's the fucking birdman!

424
01:14:56,597 --> 01:14:59,918
Ah, Jesus...

425
01:15:18,642 --> 01:15:20,633
I've been expecting you.

426
01:15:54,162 --> 01:15:56,118
It's you again.

427
01:15:59,242 --> 01:16:01,472
You borrowed my book.

428
01:16:28,642 --> 01:16:32,682
Goddammit! You shot me in
the same place as last time.

429
01:16:32,717 --> 01:16:36,477
I'm your retainer.
I don't mean you no disrespect.

430
01:16:36,512 --> 01:16:40,237
Besides, I don't want
to put too many holes in you.

431
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:45,078
Where's Sonny Valerio, Louie?

432
01:16:56,202 --> 01:16:59,042
I'll see you later, Louie.

433
01:17:02,842 --> 01:17:06,039
Vinny? Vinny?

434
01:17:07,762 --> 01:17:10,322
I'm in here, Louie.

435
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:46,887
Wow!

436
01:17:46,922 --> 01:17:50,327
That's
a big bear you killed there.

437
01:17:50,362 --> 01:17:54,642
Yep. The fucker
weighs about 300 pounds.

438
01:17:54,677 --> 01:17:56,687
Yeah.

439
01:17:56,722 --> 01:18:01,682
It's funny. I didn't even know
it was bear-hunting season.

440
01:18:01,717 --> 01:18:06,259
What are you, a game warden?
Some kinda Fed?

441
01:18:06,294 --> 01:18:10,802
No, no. I'm just asking,
you know, just asking.

442
01:18:10,837 --> 01:18:12,767
Well, I'll tell ya.

443
01:18:12,802 --> 01:18:18,382
There aren't too many of these
big black fuckers left here.

444
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:23,962
So when you get a clear shot
at it, you sure as hell take it.

445
01:18:23,997 --> 01:18:26,032
That's why you shoot 'em...

446
01:18:27,242 --> 01:18:30,822
.. 'cause there're not
that many left?

447
01:18:30,857 --> 01:18:34,367
I don't think
I understand your question.

448
01:18:34,402 --> 01:18:38,820
You know, there ain't that many
coloured people here, neither.

449
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:43,238
You oughta get back in your car
and go about your own business.

450
01:18:44,722 --> 01:18:48,237
Yeah... maybe you're right.

451
01:18:57,122 --> 01:19:00,362
Jesus Christ,
you fucking hit my knee!

452
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:04,527
You know, in ancient cultures...

453
01:19:04,562 --> 01:19:07,807
bears were considered
equal with men.

454
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:11,960
This ain't no
ancient culture here, mister.

455
01:19:14,362 --> 01:19:16,482
Sometimes it is.

456
01:19:46,762 --> 01:19:48,036
'Aaaahh... '

457
01:19:54,362 --> 01:19:55,927
You know, Louie...

458
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:59,362
There's one good thing
about this Ghost Dog guy.

459
01:19:59,397 --> 01:20:02,007
What's that, Vin?

460
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:05,722
He's sending us out
in the old way.

461
01:20:05,757 --> 01:20:08,953
Like real fucking gangsters.

462
01:20:10,882 --> 01:20:14,238
Hang on, Vin. You're gonna
make it. Just hang in there.

463
01:20:22,642 --> 01:20:25,679
Oh, Christ! Fucking five-o.

464
01:20:43,562 --> 01:20:45,527
Remain inside the vehicle.

465
01:20:45,562 --> 01:20:48,982
When you're in the city,
you never see a cop,

466
01:20:49,017 --> 01:20:52,308
but here, they're like
the fucking Gestapo!

467
01:20:52,343 --> 01:20:55,599
Like we're in some
fucking foreign country!

468
01:20:58,402 --> 01:21:01,562
My friend has to get
to a hospital.

469
01:21:01,597 --> 01:21:03,719
What happened to your arm?

470
01:21:03,754 --> 01:21:05,807
I'm fine, it's my friend here.

471
01:21:05,842 --> 01:21:08,282
License
and registration, please.

472
01:21:08,317 --> 01:21:09,887
We don't have time!

473
01:21:09,922 --> 01:21:14,313
Don't push me, mister!
Remain inside the vehicle.

474
01:21:18,282 --> 01:21:21,513
Oh, yeah...
This is terrific.

475
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:33,598
What's the situation here, sir?

476
01:21:37,762 --> 01:21:40,834
Let's get the fuck
out of here, Louie!

477
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:59,922
Jesus, Vin! You just
iced a woman, you know that?

478
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:02,127
You know what you are, Louie?

479
01:22:02,162 --> 01:22:05,527
You're a fucking
male chauvinist pig.

480
01:22:05,562 --> 01:22:09,202
What do you mean,
I'm a male chauvinist pig?

481
01:22:09,237 --> 01:22:12,482
- You just shot a broad!
- A cop!

482
01:22:12,517 --> 01:22:15,047
I just shot a cop.

483
01:22:15,082 --> 01:22:18,961
They wanna be equal...
I made her equal.

484
01:22:32,722 --> 01:22:34,474
Vin?

485
01:22:36,682 --> 01:22:39,754
Hey, Vin!
You with me over there?

486
01:22:40,882 --> 01:22:43,635
Oh, no. No...

487
01:23:20,682 --> 01:23:22,240
Hey, Raymond.

488
01:23:26,122 --> 01:23:29,080
I ain't seen you
in a while, man.

489
01:23:41,842 --> 01:23:43,798
That little girl, Pearline?

490
01:23:50,962 --> 01:23:54,302
She probably wanted
to give me that book back.

491
01:23:54,337 --> 01:23:57,489
I wonder what she
thought about it. Hey, man...

492
01:23:57,524 --> 01:24:00,642
It's a little big,
but one of those Haitian tailors

493
01:24:00,677 --> 01:24:03,031
can cut up,
fit it for you.

494
01:24:07,122 --> 01:24:09,682
Yeah, that's for you.

495
01:26:06,722 --> 01:26:08,872
Hi, guys!

496
01:26:50,842 --> 01:26:54,118
My fucking Jaguar! Shit! Fuck!

497
01:26:56,842 --> 01:26:59,197
You got a phone? Oh, man.

498
01:30:11,282 --> 01:30:13,079
Shit!

499
01:32:36,882 --> 01:32:39,680
Shit!

500
01:32:49,562 --> 01:32:51,359
What the fuck?

501
01:33:59,162 --> 01:34:01,661
Ghost Dog.
Power and equality.

502
01:34:01,696 --> 01:34:04,160
Always see everything,
my brother.

503
01:34:38,802 --> 01:34:41,475
Raymond! Raymond, man. Hey.

504
01:34:44,522 --> 01:34:46,274
You look worried.

505
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:05,287
Don't worry, man. It's OK.

506
01:35:05,322 --> 01:35:10,802
It's all right. I need to get
inside the truck, all right?

507
01:35:10,837 --> 01:35:13,111
Let me get in the truck.

508
01:35:48,362 --> 01:35:50,487
Turn around, man.

509
01:35:50,522 --> 01:35:53,594
Turn around, turn around.

510
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:30,362
No, no... No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

511
01:36:30,397 --> 01:36:32,876
Here, I wanna give you this.

512
01:36:36,922 --> 01:36:40,162
I don't want
you to worry, Raymond.

513
01:36:40,197 --> 01:36:43,155
Don't you worry about nothing.

514
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:46,113
Everything happens for a reason.

515
01:36:47,882 --> 01:36:51,921
You know that guy who was here,
with his arm in a sling?

516
01:36:54,802 --> 01:36:58,322
Yeah... I know that guy.

517
01:36:58,357 --> 01:37:00,597
He's name's Louie.

518
01:37:02,122 --> 01:37:04,192
I'm his retainer.

519
01:37:06,082 --> 01:37:08,242
See, once, a long time ago,

520
01:37:08,277 --> 01:37:12,047
he helped me out.

521
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:13,887
You motherfucker!

522
01:37:13,922 --> 01:37:17,961
What's going on?
What's the problem here?

523
01:37:19,162 --> 01:37:21,881
'And I owed him for that.

524
01:37:23,642 --> 01:37:28,442
'See, a samurai must ALWAYS
stay loyal to his boss.

525
01:37:28,477 --> 01:37:30,797
'No matter what happens. '

526
01:37:32,362 --> 01:37:38,762
Anyway, me and him, we're
from different ancient tribes.

527
01:37:38,797 --> 01:37:42,914
And now,
we're both almost extinct.

528
01:37:47,882 --> 01:37:50,367
Sometimes...

529
01:37:50,402 --> 01:37:53,474
you gotta stick
with the ancient ways.

530
01:37:55,642 --> 01:37:57,553
The old-school ways.

531
01:38:00,402 --> 01:38:03,155
I know you understand me.

532
01:38:04,802 --> 01:38:07,157
I know you understand me.

533
01:38:09,922 --> 01:38:13,119
Hello?
Anyone home in there?

534
01:38:21,162 --> 01:38:25,792
No, but thank you.
I'm not really hungry.

535
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:30,567
Ghost Dog,
I brought your book back.

536
01:38:30,602 --> 01:38:34,117
I finished it a few days ago,
but I didn't see you.

537
01:38:35,962 --> 01:38:38,087
What did you think?

538
01:38:38,122 --> 01:38:41,007
I liked
all six different stories.

539
01:38:41,042 --> 01:38:44,082
Ancient Japan
was a pretty weird place.

540
01:38:44,117 --> 01:38:47,087
But I especially
liked the first story.

541
01:38:47,122 --> 01:38:52,682
It's one story, but each person
sees a totally different story.

542
01:38:52,717 --> 01:38:56,002
- That was really good.
- "Yabu No Naka".

543
01:38:56,037 --> 01:38:59,007
That's my favourite, too.

544
01:38:59,042 --> 01:39:01,397
Well, thank you
for returning it,

545
01:39:01,432 --> 01:39:03,752
and thank you for your comments.

546
01:39:06,522 --> 01:39:09,275
- Will you do me a favour?
- What?

547
01:39:14,002 --> 01:39:17,836
Take this book...
and you read it some time.

548
01:39:19,282 --> 01:39:22,242
You don't gotta read it
right away.

549
01:39:22,277 --> 01:39:25,200
OK. Is it good?

550
01:39:27,162 --> 01:39:30,950
Yeah, well... I liked it a lot.

551
01:39:34,362 --> 01:39:37,722
It's not exactly a story,
it's kind of a...

552
01:39:37,757 --> 01:39:39,713
Ghost Dog!

553
01:39:47,002 --> 01:39:49,596
You should go home now.

554
01:40:11,882 --> 01:40:13,998
What is this, Louie?

555
01:40:15,882 --> 01:40:18,032
"High Noon"?

556
01:40:21,122 --> 01:40:23,682
This is
the final shoot-out scene?

557
01:40:26,082 --> 01:40:28,602
I guess it is.

558
01:40:28,637 --> 01:40:31,127
Yeah...

559
01:40:31,162 --> 01:40:33,118
Well, it's very dramatic.

560
01:40:35,402 --> 01:40:39,236
It's very
dramatic... and I understand.

561
01:40:40,722 --> 01:40:44,795
You have to avenge the death
of your bosses, right?

562
01:40:53,042 --> 01:40:54,600
Well, OK, then.

563
01:41:17,162 --> 01:41:18,436
Stay back!

564
01:41:23,402 --> 01:41:25,518
Raymond! Stay back.

565
01:41:56,122 --> 01:42:00,400
Now you're gonna be the boss
of your own clan, right, Louie?

566
01:42:02,362 --> 01:42:05,962
'Cause... there ain't
nobody else left...

567
01:42:05,997 --> 01:42:07,918
Ain't that right, Louie?

568
01:42:08,962 --> 01:42:11,351
No, not exactly, Ghost Dog.

569
01:42:24,722 --> 01:42:26,474
Stay there!

570
01:42:34,762 --> 01:42:38,311
It's like you said,
better you than me, right?

571
01:42:40,562 --> 01:42:44,082
Nothing makes
any sense any more.

572
01:42:44,117 --> 01:42:46,516
It's OK, Louie.

573
01:42:49,082 --> 01:42:51,835
I've seen everything
I need to see.

574
01:42:57,362 --> 01:43:00,274
Do me one favour, though.
One favour.

575
01:43:01,642 --> 01:43:04,031
What do you want me to do?

576
01:43:05,362 --> 01:43:08,647
You take this book...

577
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:12,880
and read it some time.
Then, later on...

578
01:43:14,242 --> 01:43:16,278
you can tell me what you think.

579
01:43:17,322 --> 01:43:20,359
Yeah... sure.

580
01:44:20,482 --> 01:44:22,837
Let's go!
Let's get out of here!

581
01:44:24,442 --> 01:44:26,327
This is my book.

582
01:44:26,362 --> 01:44:30,719
No, Miss Vargo, I got it
from the guy, from Ghost Dog!

583
01:44:32,282 --> 01:44:34,407
Can we get out of here?

584
01:44:34,442 --> 01:44:36,797
It takes place in ancient Japan.

585
01:44:40,802 --> 01:44:42,997
You should read it.

586
01:44:59,642 --> 01:45:01,712
We can go now.

587
01:45:52,882 --> 01:45:56,207
Pearline,
you're in the way, honey.

588
01:45:56,242 --> 01:46:00,633
Why don't you go in the other
room to read your book, darling?

589
