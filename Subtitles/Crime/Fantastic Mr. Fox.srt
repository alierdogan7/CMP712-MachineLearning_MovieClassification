341

I've never played whack-bat.
What are the rules?

342
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:37,219
No whack-bat on the other side
of the river?

343
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:40,494
No, we mostly just run grass sprints
or play acorns.

344
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:42,456
It's real simple.

345
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,098
<i>COACH SKIP: There's 3 grabbers, 3 taggers,
5 twig-runners and the player at whack-bat.</i>

346
00:20:46,223 --> 00:20:48,498
<i>The center-tagger lights a pinecone
and chucks it over the basket.</i>

347
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:51,057
<i>The whack-batter tries to hit
the cedar-stick off the cross-rock.</i>

348
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,616
<i>The twig-runners dash back and forth</i>

349
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,938
<i>until the pinecone burns out
and the umpire calls, "hot box. "</i>

350
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:57,612
At the end, you count
how many score-downs it adds up to

351
00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:58,698
and divide by 9.

352
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:00,142
- Got it.
- Go in for Ash.

You need a breather.

Let me finish this 8th.

as my dad if I keep practicing?

359

the best whack-bat player

(SNIFFING) Do you smell something?
Is that Freon?

1177
01:14:09,504 --> 01:14:13,179
Shh! I'm going to open this trap door
and see if something's on the other side.

1178
01:14:13,304 --> 01:14:16,137
I highly doubt it, though.
There's probably just more sewer.

01:14:16,904 --> 01:14:18,735
- Wouldn't it be surprising if...
- ASH: Open it.

1180
01:14:26,144 --> 01:14:29,898
Look, there's a whole enormous, glorious,
gigantic supermarket up here.

1181
01:14:30,224 --> 01:14:32,454
And they close early on weekends.

(ALL EXCLAIMING IN WONDER)

1183
01:14:36,344 --> 01:14:40,576
You really are kind of a quote-unquote
"fantastic" fox.

1184
01:14:40,704 --> 01:14:43,218
I try. Get enough to share with everybody.

1185
01:14:43,344 --> 01:14:46,734
Remember, the Rabbits are vegetarians
and Badger supposedly can't eat walnuts.

I guess now that Kristofferson's dad
is already down to single pneumonia

1188
01:14:52,464 --> 01:14:54,341
he'll be going home soon.

1189
01:14:54,464 --> 01:14:56,341
Actually, when he spoke to me
from the hospital

1190
01:14:56,464 --> 01:14:57,533
he said he was already talking to Weasel

1191
01:14:57,664 --> 01:15:00,258
about real estate availability
in our sewer system.

1192
01:15:00,384 --> 01:15:02,215
Really? Well, now's the time to buy.

Ha!

1194
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,580
Okay. I get it. Is that your trademark?

- I'm pregnant again.
- (GASPS) Wow.

I think we're both glowing.

They say all foxes
are slightly allergic to linoleum.

1201
01:15:42,384 --> 01:15:44,614
But it's cool to the paw. Try it.

1202
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:50,377
They say my tail needs to be dry-cleaned
twice a month.

1203
01:15:50,824 --> 01:15:52,098
But now it's fully detachable.

See?

1205
01:15:54,184 --> 01:15:58,684
They say our tree may never grow back.
But one day something will.

1206
01:16:00,344 --> 01:16:02,699
These crackles
are made of synthetic goose

1207
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:05,054
and these giblets
come from artificial squab.

1208
01:16:05,184 --> 01:16:08,733
Even these apples look fake.
But at least they've got stars on them.

1209
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:14,303
My point is, we'll eat tonight,
and we'll eat together.

Mmm.
