Time travel. It's easy

travel back in time?

6
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,271
Would it be enough
to just observe?

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,036
Or would knowing you had
the power to change that moment,

after all. See you in 130 years.

186
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,499
Frank Knight, you have been charged
with multiple violations...

187
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:33,205
of T.E.C. Code 40.8,
subsection nine:

188
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,974
Time travel with intent
to alter the future.

189
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,573
You're also wanted
on an outstanding warrant...

190
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,778

Silence!

194
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,127
The outstanding murder warrant against
you supercedes the present charges.

195
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,995
You have been found guilty of conspiracy
to commit murder in absentia...

196
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,065

had events played out differently.

I'm not theorizing, Professor Chan.

I'm just saying,
if time travel is possible,

206

right the wrongs of the past.

All right. This morning, Ryan Chan
starts his 30-day suspension.

243
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:30,137
This afternoon, he had Frank Knight
arrested, tried and sentenced.

244
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,776
- He served his 30 days.
- He was gone for three hours.

245
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:38,084
Nowhere in the Oversight Committee's ruling
does it say where he has to take his 30 days.

246
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,557
He happened to be there when the time
crime was being committed.

247
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:45,722
He'd already served his 30 days, so
officially he was back on active duty.

You're as bad as he is.

00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,085
Launch activated.

Cellular cohesion unstable.

335
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,366
Cell integrity unstable.

336
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,710
Cell cohesion failure.

[Doc]
O'Rourke, you better get
somebody back in that chair!

339
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,565
[Computer Voice]
There are multiple illegal
time launches in progress.

340
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,800
- Where?
- What the fuck?

341
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,638
Calculating
time launch locations.

342
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,577
These launches are coming out of the
Society for Historical Authenticity.

343
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,740
- What? You sure about that?
- No doubt, sir.

344
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,980
Ryan, you take Jeffers, assemble a team
and find out what's going on over there.

345
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,687
- You got it.
- Travis, you start the re-arrests now.

346
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,692
[Travis]
Yes, sir.

347
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,429
We lost him.

348
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,103
- Can I help you?
- Mary Jeffers?

349
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,840
- Yes.
- I'm looking for your daughter.

350
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,047
- Fredericks, check the vaults!
- Got it.

351
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,317
Samuels, take the offices.

352
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,622
- Jackson, you come with us.
- Yes, sir!

353
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:08,228
[Grunting]

354
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,711
- Jackson, open up those files.
- Right away.

355
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:22,014
- Hanley and Johnson.
- My God!

356
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,753
I was just talking
to these guys.

357
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,025
If I count right, they got everyone.

358
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:40,070
The public doesn't know
about the Society, Ryan.
This is an inside job.

359
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,403
- Miller's out.
- No way.

360
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:47,274
He's 3,000 feet underground
in the world penitentiary.

361
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:51,247
They blew up the launch space
so we couldn't track them.

362
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,251
Ryan, the Social Security
lineage vaults were broken into.

363
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,844
Let me see that.

364
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,950
The personnel files on the entire T.E.C.
have been accessed and downloaded. Shit!

365
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:07,691
That means if Miller's behind this,
he could... go back and erase the...

366
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:11,758
Ryan!
What the hell just happened?

367
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,868
Miller's eliminating us
by hitting our family lines.

368
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,240
Jeffers was never born.

369
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,718
[O'Rourke On Radio]
Ryan, get your ass back here
right now!

370
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,411
- All hell's breaking loose.
- Jackson, let's go.

371
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,428
We've got spikes across
the board! They're massive!

372
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,957
Off the scale. I've never seen
anything like this before.

373
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,970
They go all the way back
to the 19th century.

374
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,336
Now, this can't be tied
to Douglas' death.

375
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,238
You already arrested Miller
and his entire gang.

376
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:56,239
But Douglas tracked down Tony Banks for me.
That means that I never arrested Banks
because Douglas never found him.

377
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,181
Travis, get a lead on Banks right now.

378
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,686
Computer, was there a breakout
at the world penitentiary?

379
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,087

There was a major riot
and prison break two days ago.

Prisoners are unaccounted for.

383

Penitentiary still under siege.

384
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,469
I still don't have a lead on Banks.

385
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:28,171
Banks broke him out of prison.

We gotta stop this prison break before

- Travis!
- Yeah, boss?

00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,195
Prepare for another

in that seat.

Accelerated launch probability:
68.3%.

401
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,195
You got about a 30-minute window
before the prison riot starts.

402
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,896
I wouldn't want to be
in that place when it does.

403
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:30,532
You do realize the risk of running an
accelerated launch without an exact location?

404
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,735
Just don't land him
in the middle of a wall.

405
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,268
If my space and time telemetry's off, I
could land him on the moon, for Christ's sake.

- Launch him!

- Good to go, Ryan.
- Thanks, man. Let's do it, Doc.

415
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,201
Listen to me. A normal launch has
a failure rate of 4%.

416
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,838
Launching you again this soon
raises that to 20%.

417
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,246
- But an accelerated launch...
- Just give me the shot, Doc!

418
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:15,911
- God! Ryan, this is not safe!
We shouldn't be doing this!
- Doc!

00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:21,319
Give me the shot, or
my molecules will be scattered
from here to hell and back!

Hey, Ryan, I thought you might
show up here today.

444
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:40,450
For two years,
in this hole, I've waited.

445
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,188
If only you'd opened your mind
and allowed yourself to think...

446
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,248
beyond the confines of a timecop,

447
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,853
we would be so much further
along by now.

00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,261
- It's bothered you, hasn't it?
- What's that?

00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,668
The decision you made in Berlin.

00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:04,538
To save Hitler,
kill my wife.

452
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,504
I know.

453
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,310
We both lost something that night.

454
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,375
Part of who we were.

455
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,321
But I tell you what, Ryan,

456
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,881
I'm willing to put all that
aside and move forward...

457
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:27,462
because what we're dealing with
is much, much bigger than us.

458
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,431
You want me to forget
Berlin ever happened?

459
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,702
Forget about Edwards
and your Sasha? Is that it?

460
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:37,468
- Yes.
- You are insane.

00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,035
What's your definition
of insanity, Ryan?

462
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:46,607
Is it really yours, or is it
just something you've been told?

463
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,508
What do you say
we jump back in time...

464
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:53,819
to when man first decided to
lock up all those deemed insane?

465
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,883
Don't you want to know
who made that decision?

466
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,452
Don't you want to make sure
they got it right?

467
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,425
Or did they destroy the lives
of some of the greatest...

468
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,834
scientists, artists and philosophers
we would have ever known...

469
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,863

were different?

00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:19,305
out of the respect and love
I had for your father,

To what?
Play God with you?

Decide who's nuts, who's not?
Who dies, who lives?

475
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,325
You're right, Miller.
This is bigger than us.

476
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,160
And that's the way
it's going to stay.

477
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,291
God, you disappoint me.

Killing you here
gives me no satisfaction!

481
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:56,345
But to accomplish what I believe
I was put on this earth for,

482
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,049
I have to make sure you were
never born in any incarnation.

483
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,332
I will miss
what your father taught me.

484
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,564
I will miss what you and I could
have accomplished together.

485
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,538
Look at me.

486
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,098
I will miss the challenge.

I lost him.
You have to send me back.

00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,937
- There's a glitch.
- Travis, program me for relaunch now!

493
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,568
What do you want me to do, boss?
A relaunch with no rest cycle
could kill him.

494
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,578
I talked to him.
He's out of his mind.

495
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,739
You've gotta send me back.
If you don't, I'm dead.

He doesn't even know where he is.

666
01:00:03,314 --> 01:00:07,250
- We lost Miller. What happened?
- We had him in 1988, and he just...

667
01:00:07,318 --> 01:00:11,152
Went off the screens. He must be
masking his time wake somehow.

668
01:00:11,221 --> 01:00:13,587
What happened to your eye patch?

669
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:17,058
Eye patch?
What the hell's wrong with him?

670
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:20,096
He barely made it back.
We're lucky he's alive.

671
01:00:20,164 --> 01:00:23,861
All right, he needs
medical attention right now.

672
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:27,233
Well, it's over.
Ryan's my last guy.

673
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:31,707
[Travis]
- Then we have to send him again.
- Send him where?

674
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:36,109
We don't know where Miller is.
Besides, look at him.

675
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,442
Even if he survives the launch,

676
01:00:37,648 --> 01:00:43,280
he's so disoriented he wouldn't be
any good to us.

677
01:00:43,354 --> 01:00:47,814
- [Miller] Out of the respect
and love I had for your father,
- No!

678
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:50,883
I'm giving you a second chance.

679
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:54,359
[Gasps]

680
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:56,729
- Hey.
- What happened? Where's Miller?

681
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,702
- No one knows.
- I have to find him.
He's going to destroy my family.

682
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:03,001
- My parents... God,
my parents will be next.
- No.

683
01:01:03,073 --> 01:01:07,407
You're in no condition to help anyone.
You need your strength.

684
01:01:09,446 --> 01:01:11,573
What happened to my watch?

685
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:16,450
[Chuckles]
It stopped the bullet.
Saved your life.

686
01:01:24,194 --> 01:01:26,128
[Miller]
What I would give...

687
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:29,290
to be able to sit
and talk with you,

688
01:01:29,366 --> 01:01:32,494
knowing what I know now.

689
01:01:35,472 --> 01:01:37,337
He killed my father.

690
01:01:37,408 --> 01:01:39,342
- What? How?
- Miller killed my father.

691
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,640
- What are you talking about?
- I know where Miller is.

692
01:01:41,712 --> 01:01:44,442
Wait! No, no, no. Wait. Sit down.
You're not making any sense.

693
01:01:44,515 --> 01:01:46,540
You have to launch me back
before it's too late.

694
01:01:46,617 --> 01:01:49,177
Oh, no, no. No, we cannot
launch you again.

695
01:01:49,253 --> 01:01:53,155
May 7, 2002, 3:20 p.m.
That's when Miller killed my father.

696
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:56,283
Why? Why would he kill your father then?
You were already born.

697
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,453
- It would do him no good.
- Miller was looking for me!

698
01:01:58,529 --> 01:02:01,020
You're making this sound
like it already happened.

699
01:02:01,098 --> 01:02:04,295
It did already happen! It's about
to happen again if I don't stop him!

700
01:02:04,368 --> 01:02:06,302
You've been launched too many times.

701
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:09,965
You gotta launch me again, or Miller's
gonna kill me when I'm 11 in 2002.

702
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,874
No. He didn't kill you before, why
would he kill you now?

703
01:02:13,944 --> 01:02:17,641
He's already changed history, Betsy.
Last time I came back, you were dead.

704
01:02:17,715 --> 01:02:19,876
[Chuckles]
Dead? Oh...

705
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:24,387
You tried to alter history to save
your husband from dying in the war.

706
01:02:24,455 --> 01:02:26,980
Ryan, my husband did die in the war.

707
01:02:27,057 --> 01:02:31,323
In this time line. But in the real
time line, there was no war.

708
01:02:31,395 --> 01:02:35,331
You gotta believe me, Betsy.

709
01:02:35,399 --> 01:02:41,304
Listen to me. You're the one
who always said to me that if
a timecop does his job right,

710
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:44,499
no one knows if
he got it right except him.

711
01:02:44,575 --> 01:02:50,536
This same timecop would also be the
only one to know if he got it wrong.

712
01:02:53,117 --> 01:02:55,642
This one got by me, Bets.

713
01:03:00,324 --> 01:03:02,258
I hope you know what you're doing.

714
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:08,161
I'll see you for dinner.

715
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:10,331
What?

716
01:03:10,534 --> 01:03:13,628
[Ryan]
Hey, Travis. Wake up.

717
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:15,998
O'Rourke, you should see this.

718
01:03:16,073 --> 01:03:19,406
Come on, Travis.
Los Angeles, May 7, 2002,

719
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:21,544
University of Southern California.

720
01:03:21,612 --> 01:03:25,070
- Ryan, what the hell are you doing?
- Get me there before 3:20 p.m.

721
01:03:28,485 --> 01:03:30,919
- I can't do it, kid. It'll kill ya.
- Launch me.

722
01:03:33,457 --> 01:03:36,517
[Grunts]
Let him go.

723
01:03:39,997 --> 01:03:41,362
Launch him.

724
01:03:43,033 --> 01:03:46,400
[Travis]
Prepare for another relaunch, guys.

725
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:49,928
[Female Computer Voice]
Launch activation T-minus 11, 10...

726
01:03:49,973 --> 01:03:51,497
Don't forget that.

727
01:03:51,575 --> 01:03:54,135
Eight, seven, six...

728
01:03:54,211 --> 01:03:56,475
[Doc]
Good luck!

729
01:04:02,886 --> 01:04:05,650
Initiating time phase.

730
01:04:05,722 --> 01:04:07,713
[Computer]
Time phase initiated.

731
01:04:21,905 --> 01:04:24,465
[Computer]
Cellular integrity unstable.

732
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:27,066
[Screaming]

733
01:04:27,144 --> 01:04:30,136
- He's not gonna make it!
- Emergency shut down.

734
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:32,774
It's too late, sir.
We already initiated it.

735
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,841
[Computer]
Launch failing.

736
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,297
[Chiming]

737
01:04:55,205 --> 01:04:57,833
There are far too many
variables, Mr. Miller,

738
01:04:57,908 --> 01:05:01,708
to theorize what might have
happened historically,

739
01:05:01,745 --> 01:05:03,303
had events played out differently.

740
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,941
I'm not theorizing, Professor Chan.
I'm just saying if time travel is possible,

741
01:05:07,017 --> 01:05:10,509
we have a moral obligation
to right the wrongs of the past.

742
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:16,548
So are you suggesting that if it were
possible to change historic events, we should?

743
01:05:16,627 --> 01:05:18,686
[Laughing]
Yes, absolutely.

744
01:05:18,762 --> 01:05:20,957
Without knowing
the results of those changes?

745
01:05:21,031 --> 01:05:24,523
Changes that would have a profound
effect on our world as we know it.

746
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,966
I don't see the problem with that, as
long as the changes are for the better.

747
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:30,836
All right.
Let's run with your idea.

748
01:05:30,908 --> 01:05:36,847
Let's say hypothetically that we do
go back in time to make things right.

749
01:05:36,914 --> 01:05:41,817
Whose moral guidelines are we
working within? Yours? Mine?

750
01:05:41,885 --> 01:05:44,410
What happens if we have
a difference of opinion?

751
01:05:44,488 --> 01:05:46,422
Whose rules are we playing by?

752
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:49,755
I think we all share a common
ground morally and ethically,

753
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:51,658
so some good would come out of it.

754
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:55,220
What's the point of researching time
travel, if not to right the wrongs?

755
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:58,097
We're historians, right?

756
01:05:58,168 --> 01:06:01,569
Wouldn't you like
to observe history firsthand,

757
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:04,368
be there to authenticate
history's accuracy?

758
01:06:04,441 --> 01:06:06,033
Yeah, that'd be cool.

759
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:10,045
But to stand around and do nothing
seems like a colossal waste of knowledge.

760
01:06:10,113 --> 01:06:14,277
I mean, can I at least stop the guys
from flying the planes into the buildings?

761
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:18,253
Or the fanatic from walking into
a restaurant wearing a bomb?

762
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:23,555
As much as we all wish those horrific events
never happened, the fact is they did.

763
01:06:23,627 --> 01:06:25,561
Then let's prevent them
from happening.

764
01:06:25,629 --> 01:06:28,564
But we are who we are today
because of them.

765
01:06:28,632 --> 01:06:34,434
Our anger, our compassion,
our awareness, our knowledge.

766
01:06:34,504 --> 01:06:38,941
We alter history, it all changes...
good and bad.

767
01:06:39,009 --> 01:06:42,911
[Sighs]
Yeah, I... I guess so.

768
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,143
Think about it.

769
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:50,778
[Chiming]

770
01:06:50,854 --> 01:06:53,152
We'll have to pick
this up next week.

771
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:08,665
[Woman Laughing]

772
01:07:08,739 --> 01:07:11,264
So, who wants ice cream?

773
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:15,778
[Young Ryan]
I do, but I have to go
to the rest room first.

774
01:07:15,846 --> 01:07:17,814
- You do?
- Yeah.

775
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:19,815
- We'll be just a minute.
- I'll wait here.

776
01:07:19,883 --> 01:07:21,817
Come on, then.

777
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:25,116
- See you next week, Professor.
- Good debate today.

778
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:27,247
- Thanks. Hey, Ryan.
- Hi.

779
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:51,937
Come on, Ryan.
You okay?

780
01:07:52,015 --> 01:07:55,007
Yeah. Come on.
It's cool.

781
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:04,055
I'll be back as soon as I can.

782
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:13,563
[Sasha]
What's wrong, baby?

783
01:08:13,637 --> 01:08:16,367
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.

784
01:08:19,142 --> 01:08:21,076
- You gonna be quick?
- Yeah.

785
01:08:21,144 --> 01:08:23,009
All right.

786
01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:46,232
Hello, Professor.
It's good to see you again.

787
01:08:48,638 --> 01:08:51,766
Miller?
What the hell is this?

788
01:08:51,842 --> 01:08:57,144
What I would give to be able to sit
and talk with you...

789
01:08:57,214 --> 01:08:59,239
knowing what I know now.

790
01:08:59,316 --> 01:09:01,841
Why do you look so different?

791
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:04,716
Shh.

792
01:09:04,788 --> 01:09:08,884
- I have an appointment with your son.
- Ryan?

793
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:10,722
[Professor Chan]
What are you doing?

794
01:09:10,794 --> 01:09:13,354
[Miller]
Come out, come out wherever you are.

795
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:17,196
No. No!

796
01:09:22,506 --> 01:09:28,274
- Miller, what are you...
- Professor, I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

797
01:09:28,345 --> 01:09:31,041
[Buzzing]
[Gasps]

798
01:09:39,856 --> 01:09:43,883
[Chiming]

799
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,487
Oh, my God.
What did you do to him?

800
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:52,395
You'll figure it out one day.

801
01:09:56,006 --> 01:09:59,134
I can kill him before you can
even get into that stall.

802
01:09:59,209 --> 01:10:01,803
You'd be altering history.

803
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:06,815
You'd be going against
everything you stand for.

804
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:12,844
Oh, but it's different when it
affects you personally, right?

805
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:16,120
You fucking hypocrite.

806
01:10:17,594 --> 01:10:22,156
Go on. Go on. Do it.

807
01:10:22,232 --> 01:10:24,530
You kill him, you kill me.

808
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:26,694
Your father never dies.

809
01:10:32,509 --> 01:10:36,570
Something to think about, isn't it?

810
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:39,206
The ultimate validation.

811
01:10:39,282 --> 01:10:42,149
This is between you and me.

812
01:10:44,554 --> 01:10:45,384
Attaboy.

813
01:10:49,759 --> 01:10:52,523
Come on, Ryan.
Let's see what you got.

814
01:11:08,878 --> 01:11:11,904
Let's put an end to it all right here.
Come on, baby!

815
01:11:11,982 --> 01:11:14,382
Don't let me down.

816
01:11:16,219 --> 01:11:18,517
Yes.

817
01:11:29,566 --> 01:11:32,729
You spent your entire life
playing by the rules.

818
01:11:32,802 --> 01:11:35,999
What have you got to show for it?
Nothing.

819
01:11:40,877 --> 01:11:43,175
Sasha.

820
01:11:43,246 --> 01:11:47,205
Oh, my beautiful Sasha.

821
01:11:47,284 --> 01:11:51,812
You are looking at the man that took
two years of our life away from us.

822
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:56,750
You tell her what you did to her.
You tell her!

823
01:11:58,828 --> 01:12:00,352
I didn't want it to be this way.

824
01:12:01,698 --> 01:12:04,030
I gave you every opportunity.

825
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,637
Come on!

826
01:12:15,712 --> 01:12:18,374
Thattaboy. I knew you
wouldn't let me down.

827
01:14:00,917 --> 01:14:02,350
Yes.

828
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:54,035
It doesn't have to be this way.
You can change all this.

829
01:15:06,516 --> 01:15:11,920
[Coughing, Gasping]

[Ryan Narrating]
History is being
altered every second,

831
01:15:38,948 --> 01:15:42,315
by a look, a simple gesture...

832
01:15:42,385 --> 01:15:46,321
or that unintentional
footprint left in the sand.

833
01:15:46,389 --> 01:15:51,656
All secrets hidden in time,
locked in time.

834
01:15:51,728 --> 01:15:56,927
[Chiming]
And unless you were there,
you'll never know the truth.

835
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:08,239
There you are.
I've been looking everywhere
for you. Where've you been?

836
01:16:08,311 --> 01:16:10,279
Around.

837
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:12,541
- You okay?
- Yeah.

838
01:16:12,615 --> 01:16:15,243
You look like you've been on one
too many jumps this month.

839
01:16:15,318 --> 01:16:17,286
You got that right.

840
01:16:17,353 --> 01:16:21,380
Hey, Jeffers,
it's good to see you.

841
01:16:23,593 --> 01:16:25,527
Kiss my ass, Ryan.

842
01:16:25,595 --> 01:16:28,393
[Chuckles]

843
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:34,601
Hey, Ryan.

844
01:16:37,674 --> 01:16:41,041
Hey, Edwards.

845
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:45,274
Damn it, O'Rourke, you are not giving
these guys enough turn around time.

846
01:16:45,348 --> 01:16:49,409
We're suspending them in their
own reality, and ripping them
back and forth through time.

847
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:52,818
I just got the results of Casey's CAT scan.
That's a cerebral hemorrhage.

848
01:16:52,889 --> 01:16:55,687
It's your responsibility
to start reigning these guys in.

849
01:16:55,758 --> 01:16:59,216
- Will you give it a rest, Doc?
- Give it a rest?

850
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:02,731
And you were supposed to check
in with me as soon as you got back.

851
01:17:02,799 --> 01:17:05,097
I think I like you better
with the lip ring.

852
01:17:05,168 --> 01:17:07,864
- Lip ring?
- Where the hell have you been?

853
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:11,168
- Saving the world.
- [Chuckles]

854
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,437
You still want me
to give it a rest?

855
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:18,344
- Just put it in your report.
- We still on for tonight?

856
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,445
- I don't date...
- Timecops.

857
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:27,421
- I know. 8:00?
- 8:00.

858
01:17:31,127 --> 01:17:31,889
[Alarm Beeping]

859
01:17:32,128 --> 01:17:35,620
[Computer Voice]
We have a Time breach in progress.

860
01:17:42,939 --> 01:17:46,534
* You're light, euphoric *

861
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:49,772
* I've waited for so long *

862
01:17:49,846 --> 01:17:51,837
* I'm crashing *

863
01:17:51,914 --> 01:17:55,645
* It's the sweet foam in those eyes *

864
01:17:55,718 --> 01:17:59,085
* Like a six-ton megabomb *

865
01:17:59,155 --> 01:18:03,091
* You're supersonic *

866
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:06,492
* I weathered through this time *

867
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:10,362
* The force erratic *

868
01:18:10,433 --> 01:18:13,800
* Like a deuce from a laser storm *

869
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:17,738
* The sound subsonic *

870
01:18:17,807 --> 01:18:21,243
* Like a car crash in the rain *

871
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:24,973
* Your karma is solid *

872
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:27,516
* You gotta wonder
It's all your own *

873
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:31,610
* Heaven knows *

874
01:18:31,688 --> 01:18:36,523
* Heaven knows
Heaven *

875
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:40,084
* Still I felt so right *

876
01:18:40,163 --> 01:18:43,929
* I've never known before *

877
01:18:47,904 --> 01:18:51,499
* Never felt so right *

878
01:18:51,574 --> 01:18:54,839
* Never felt so right *

879
01:18:54,911 --> 01:18:58,813
* I've never known before *

880
01:19:13,496 --> 01:19:16,897
* Your thigh, your hips *

881
01:19:16,966 --> 01:19:20,367
* Like a meltdown power zone *

882
01:19:20,436 --> 01:19:22,370
* Pressed on me *

883
01:19:22,438 --> 01:19:26,169
* Like the very thought of it all *

884
01:19:26,242 --> 01:19:29,541
* Like a voice in a hurricane *

885
01:19:29,612 --> 01:19:33,673
* Your heart, platonic *

886
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:37,117
* I've waited for so long *

887
01:19:37,186 --> 01:19:40,952
* The source, excited *

888
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:44,390
* Like life on a runaway train *

889
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:48,453
* The spike, exotic *

890
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:51,796
* Rush into my mind *

891
01:19:51,868 --> 01:19:55,531
* Your own, your soul *

892
01:19:55,605 --> 01:19:58,165
* You're ice in a desert plain *

893
01:19:58,241 --> 01:20:02,701
* Heaven knows *

894
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:07,113
* Heaven knows
Heaven *

895
01:20:07,183 --> 01:20:10,675
* Still I felt so right *

896
01:20:10,753 --> 01:20:15,053
* I've never known before *

897
01:20:18,528 --> 01:20:22,157
* Never felt so right *

898
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:25,428
* Never felt so right *

899
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:29,870
* I've never know before *
