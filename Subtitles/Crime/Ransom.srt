- That's okay. We'll find it.

297
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,670
You know, what I don't understand
is these people,

298
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,171
this he, she, it, whoever

299
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,758
has got enough brains to snatch
my son right from under my nose,

300
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,427
but they only ask me for $2 million.

301
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,681
- Don't they know what I'm worth?
- No, no. He's being smart, okay?

Keeping it nice and simple for you.

303
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,479
Now, he knows you got it. Knows you
won't have a problem coughing it up.

304
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,482
Maybe that's all he needs.

305
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,902
Can I... Can I just...

306
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,991
Look, the reason you're here
and not the police

307
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,744
is that we, my wife and I, we believe

308
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,036
that this might be somehow connected

309
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,331
- with the machinists' union indictments.
- Okay.

310
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,001
So Jackie Brown.

311
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,087
The man was caught on tape
taking a pay-off

312
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,466
during contract negotiations
with another airline, Infinite Air.

313
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,051
It was a sting, okay?
So there he is, dead in the water.

314
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,387
He says to your people,
"Can we do something here?"

315
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,348
And so he offers me up.

316
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,976
Yeah, he said Tom gave him
a quarter of a million dollars

317
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,686
for a sweetheart deal with the union.

318
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,481
Now, I have been
investigated exhaustively.

319
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,901
Me, my company, my family. My family.

320
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,903
We've been dragged through
the tabloid mud,

321
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,822
courtesy of FBI leaks,
and nothing. All right? Nothing.

322
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,991
Now Jackie Brown's in jail
where he belongs, and he's pissed,

323
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,160
and I think he's got some
pretty unsavory associates out there.

324
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,579
Mr. Mullen, obviously we're very aware
of the Jackie Brown situation...

325
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,498
- And?
- We're still working on it.

326
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,500
Jesus Christ, I think you should
pay a little more attention.

327
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,460

00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:29,247
- Get the name of...
- I told you no cops.

828
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,915
Ah, jeez!

829
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,542
(GRUNTING)

830
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,836
You were supposed to
follow the money!

831
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,546
They were following the money, Tom.

832
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,882
The guy had a gun in your face.
They didn't have a choice.

833
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,050
They thought you were
in direct danger.

834
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,927
KATHERINE: What does that mean?
What does "wrong" mean?

835
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:44,721
I mean, is he dead?
Because if he's dead

836
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,307
just say he's dead.
Don't tell me something went wrong.

837
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:48,808
Just say my son is dead!

838
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,394
KIMBA: Kate, we are operating
under the assumption that he's alive.

839
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,813
(SCREAMING) You mean you don't
know! You don't know where he is!

840
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,189
You don't know if he is!

841
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:58,192
You're the goddamn FBI,
and you don't know shit!

842
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,485
We have every agent... Every agent...

843
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:00,945
You killed the son of a bitch
and now... What?

844
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,365
- Katie. Katie.
- Get... God! (SOBBING)

845
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,327
Go. Go away. Go. Go.

846
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,582
We know that the kidnapper
at the quarry was not alone.

847
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,167
We know that.

848
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,253
We also have a real good idea

849
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,589
about who he was teamed up with.
Now, let me show you something.

850
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:23,593
The guy at the quarry, Cubby Barnes,
has been in jail twice for burglary.

851
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,511
This is no high-tech mastermind.

852
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:30,934
This guy right here...
Kate, Tom, you recognize him?

853
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,357
- Do you?
- No.

854
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:41,444
Okay. Now, this is Clark Barnes,
brother to the subject.

855
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:45,114
Now, we went back and we found him
in your son's video of the park.

856
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:48,117
This guy is the brains in the family

857
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:51,162
and we also know he's a lot higher up
the criminal food chain.

858
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,455
According to the NYPD,

859
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,041
this guy Clark, his brother Cubby,
they're supposed to be inseparable.

860
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,543
Now, I guarantee you, we are gonna
do our homework on this

861
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,629
and we will come up
with another player.

862
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,381
In the meantime, what we gotta do...

863
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,384
JACK: Aw, Christ. Not this shit.

864
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,636
- We got a cameraman.
- Jack.

865
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,554
KIMBA: Can we get
some agents out there?

866
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,476
NEWSCASTER:
This just in. A breaking story...

867
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,936
Lonnie. It's out.

868
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,062
...from our New York bureau.

869
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,647
State police sources tell us

870
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,567
a man has been shot and killed
in an apparent botched ransom drop.

871
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,737
There's also word that multimillionaire
airIine moguI Tom MuIIen

872
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,239
has been pIaced at the scene.

873
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:28,992
With more on that story,
Iet's go to Donna Hanover Iive

874
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,660
in front of Tom Mullen's
New York home.

875
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,911
- Goddamn.
- Donna.

876
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,580
We have no officiaI report yet
on the identity of the victim

877
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,333
or his role in
the Sean Mullen kidnapping.

878
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:40,420
HopefuIIy, we'II have more information
for you Iater in this hour,

879
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:44,590
but details have been slow to come
from the poIice and FBI sources.

880
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,592
We'II bring you fuII
deveIopments tomorrow morning

881
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:49,012
beginning with
Good Day, New York, and, ofcourse,

882
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:50,638
as things happen here
at the MuIIen apartment buiIding...

883
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,348
- What are you doing?
- ...we'II bring you the information.

884
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,100
- Calling my mother.
- No, man, you can't do that.

885
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,685
- Not from this phone.
- Get the fuck out of here.

886
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,854
Hey, hey, put the phone down.

887
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,856
What's the matter, Jimmy?
You don't want my mother to know

888
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,441
that her son's dead
'cause you fucked up?

889
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,445
- Turn that shit off.
- I mean, that's what happened, isn't it?

890
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,698
I mean, it's not exactly like
this guy just rolled over, is it, Jim?

891
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,284
Just take it easy.
Put the goddamn phone down.

892
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,912
(WHIMPERING)

893
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,458
He's a fucking kid.

894
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,294
Oh, shit!

895
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,757
Hey, hey, calm down. Take it easy.

896
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,552
You want me to calm down, huh?
You want me to fucking calm down?

897
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,972
You realize they're looking for me
right now, Jimmy? I'm fingered!

898
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,558
I can't go back to my life! What do you
want me to do? You tell me!

899
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,726
- Shut up.
- You tell me, huh?

900
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,894
You know,
you're not gonna be able to go

901
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,312
to your brother's funeral either, man.

902
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,565
Shut the fuck up!
The kid goes in the ground, Jim.

903
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,734
That's it. That's it. Fuck the money.

904
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,320
- We do the kid, and I'm out of here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

905
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,073
He's right. I mean,
you said you were gonna do it anyhow.

906
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,491
Shut up!

907
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,285
- Where are you going?
- Get out of my fucking...

908
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,371
(CHOKING)

909
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,840
Take a breath.

910
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,968
- Come on, come on. Take a breath.
- (COUGHING)

911
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,682
I brought you in on this
'cause you had brains and balls.

912
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,852
Think.

913
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:26,025
The kid's gonna die
when we don't need him anymore.

914
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,195
Now, use your fucking head.

915
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,369
Go check on the kid.

916
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:45,878
It's all right. Go on. Go on.

917
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,223
They kill your brother,
and you wanna walk away?

918
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,184
What the hell does that make you?

919
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,064
This thing is not over.

920
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,692
I swear to you right now.

921
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,069
Now, more than ever

922
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:15,241
this guy will pay.

923
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,249
(HEAVY METAL PLAYING)

924
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,922
Can I have a chocolate bar?

925
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,891
- I know you.
- No, you don't.

926
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,643
Don't look at me! Don't look at me.

927
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,647
Chocolate bar. What,
do you think this isn't happening?

928
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,900
What, you think your dad's gonna
come in and save you?

929
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,860
Is that what you think? Well, he ain't.

930
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,403
Nobody's coming, all right?

931
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,740
You understand that? Nobody's coming
'cause this is it for you.

932
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,078
NEWSCASTER: ...surfacing
surrounding the high-profiIe

933
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,164
kidnapping case
of Tom MuIIen's son, Sean.

934
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,208
New York One has
exclusive information about...

935
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,001
MILES: You know what
the brothers call this?

936
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,503
This is "more drama," right?

937
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:15,092
Like, "Shit, man, more drama?
Best stay indoors today."

938
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,387
You ever hear that? "More drama."

939
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:22,725
More drama. More Dramamine.

940
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:24,810
Drambuie.

941
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,273
- You all right?
- No, yeah. Yeah, good.

942
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:31,776
Yeah.

943
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,493
- Kimba, listen to this.
- (ON TAPE) lt shouldn't be a problem.

944
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,661
JACK: That.

945
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,871
After "It shouldn't be
a problem," what do you hear?

946
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,707
- KIMBA: Wait. Play it back again.
- (TAPE REWINDING)

947
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,878
It shouIdn't be a probIem.

948
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:53,047
KIMBA: It sounds like some kind of horn.

949
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,633
JACK: Yeah, I know it's a horn,
but what... It's like...

950
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,551
It's like there's a horn,
a sort of foghorn.

951
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,178
KIMBA: It's too fast for a ferry.

952
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:04,600
It shouIdn't be a probIem.

953
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,022
In the meantime,
now you give her a big hug from me.

954
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,359
Nah, I don't care. You wake her up.

955
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,987
Nah, don't wake her up. I'm just...

956
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,448
Ah, girl, I am so glad we are not rich.

957
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,619
You just gotta thank God
for what you have.

958
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:28,040
I love you, too. I gotta go.
I'm gonna call you back.

959
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:31,294
Okay. Bye-bye. Hey.

960
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:38,467
Why...

961
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,143
Why would this guy, these people...
Why would they...

962
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:54,275
Why would they ever let
my son go no matter what I do?

963
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,902
I mean, no matter what I do.

964
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:00,031
I mean, pay, don't pay, comply,
tell him to go fuck himself.

965
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,615
Why would they give him back?

966
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:04,201
I mean, he's a witness
any way you cut it.

967
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:08,497
It's all bullshit. It's all just...
Just seven out of 10.

968
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,750
What are you saying?

969
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,630
All right.

970
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:21,135
Morlock Man gets his money,
I don't think we'll ever see Sean again.

971
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,596
That's if he's still alive to begin with.

972
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,431
- HAWKINS: Well, now...
- Tom?

973
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,141
...are you talking about not paying?

974
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,519
- No. No, we pay him.
- Now, wait a minute. Listen to me.

975
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,398
Morlock Man says the pick-up guy
will give me an address for Sean.

976
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:36,776
I get there, the guy
sticks a gun in my face.

977
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,902
I said, "You want the money?

978
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,070
"Now give me the address.
Where's the address?"

979
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,780
You should have seen his face.

980
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:45,159
He had no, absolutely no idea
what I was talking about. None.

981
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,285
Okay.

982
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,163
This is not business to him.
This is very personal.

983
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:52,750
I tell you that everybody pays,
and we get back seven out of 10.

984
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,543
If we give him what he wants,
he will kill Sean.

985
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,337
Tom, you gotta play the odds, man.

986
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,715
I've been doing this for 18 years.

987
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,008
And if I were a betting man,

988
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:04,512
I would bet on the people
who pay every time out of the gate.

989
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:09,225
Did you bet on the ones
where you got back a corpse?

990

I swear to you
I will work on nothing else.

1189
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,448
If I have to, I will take
a leave of absence from the FBI

1190
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,326
and you can hire me as
your personal security consultant.

1191

as long as I am physically able.

since your husband's TV thing,

looking for your child.

Now, I gotta tell you, Kate.

1207
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:39,135
I have never been confronted with such
an unbelievable act of sabotage

pulled off here today.

It is all on you now

1211
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,979
to talk to your husband,
get him to withdraw this money.

1212
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:51,856
- Otherwise we are in deep trouble.
- Withdraw the... What if he's right?

What if they have no intention
of returning Sean at all?

1214
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:59,489
- I trust him.
- You trust him?

1215

Yeah.

1222
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,896
about Jackie Brown?

- Yeah.

- Yeah, sure.

if I can come up with the $2 million,

1226

that he'd work it
so that I can make the drop.

1227
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,623
- Come on, Kate...
- Now, all I can raise

1228
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,958
is about a half a million.

to a discretionary fund.

you should talk to Tom about this.

1482
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,359
I'II teII you, this is the second time

1483
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:46,610
- Jimmy Shaker's been shot.
- Just one-way.

1484
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:49,863
He got cIipped once before in 1992,
and this guy keeps coming back.

1485
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:52,824
Yeah. Mr. Kinney. Yeah. Thanks.

1486
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:54,034
NEWSCASTER:
Continuing our coverage

1487
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:55,285
of the MuIIen kidnapping case,

1488
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:58,080
questions still surround Maris Connor.

1489
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:00,332
With no prior criminaI record,

1490
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:03,085
authorities are interrogating
famiIy and friends,

1491
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:05,337
seeking any associations
that would connect her

1492
01:38:05,421 --> 01:38:07,464
to the other sIain suspects.

1493
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:10,717
Sources reveal today that
the investigation continues

1494
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:14,096
and the search for other suspects
is by no means over.

1495
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,139
Many investigators
believe that, indeed,

1496
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:17,891
the mastermind
of the MuIIen kidnapping

1497
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:19,726
may stiII be at Iarge.

1498
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:22,312
(LAUGHING)

1499
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,607
TOM: We can make it.

1500
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:29,152
KATHERINE: You cold, honey?
SEAN: Yeah. My hands.

1501
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,654
- Do you wanna go home?
- I didn't bring my gloves.

1502
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:32,155
- No. No. No.
- You sure?

1503
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,283
Hey, you're squinting a little.
Is the sun still bothering you?

1504
01:38:34,367 --> 01:38:35,701
TOM: Put these on.
SEAN: Yeah.

1505
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:38,579
- I'll go get your gloves.
- Okay.

1506
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:41,248
You'd better practice. I'll be back.

1507
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:46,253
KATHERINE: Look at me.
You look good in those, honey.

1508
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:47,963
Look at my glasses. Can you see?

1509
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:50,215
Look like your daddy in those.

1510
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,552
TOM: Well, David, it's a little hard
to focus right now. Can it wait?

1511
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:58,098
No? Well, the hell with it, then.
Let him have it. Let it go.

1512
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:01,852
Yeah. Listen, I got Sean waiting for me
in the park, so maybe we...

1513
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:03,186
- Hey.
- Hey.

1514
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:05,689
Hey. I'll call you back, David.
Call you back.

1515
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,650
Mr. Mullen.
The doorman just called up.

1516
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:10,277
- FATIMA: Mr. Shaker wants to see you.
- Yeah, yeah,

1517
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:11,653
I'm sorry to show up like this.

1518
01:39:11,738 --> 01:39:13,864
Oh, hell, no. Come in.
I wanna talk to you.

1519
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,324
- Thanks.
- Come in. Come in.

1520
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:16,867
How's the shoulder?

1521
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:19,202
You know. I'll live.

1522
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:21,913
Yeah. Well, I'm surprised
to see you up and about so quick.

1523
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:24,499
- Fatima, this is Jimmy Shaker.
- Hi.

1524
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:26,335
I'm very proud to meet you.

1525
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:29,087
- Very proud.
- Thanks.

1526
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,384
How's the kid doing?

1527
01:39:34,469 --> 01:39:37,262
Oh, he's fine, you know,
all things considered.

1528
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:39,723
- It'll take a while.
- Yeah.

1529
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:45,228
Forgive me. I thought
we were gonna meet on Monday.

1530
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:46,647
Maybe I screwed up. I don't... I...

1531
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:50,233
Yeah, you're right.
Monday. We... That's what we said...

1532
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:53,487
DISPATCHER: (ON RADIO)
See the special officer holding 4-5-9...

1533
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,280
(SWITCHES RADIO OFF)

1534
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:59,785
Look, I don't want you to get
the wrong impression of me here,

1535
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:03,163
but I was hoping
we could do this today.

1536
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:05,791
- You know, the reward and all?
- Oh. Of course.

1537
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,292
- Oh, Jesus.
- 'Cause I gotta tell you,

1538
01:40:07,377 --> 01:40:10,837
it's kind of crazy around me, you know,
with the press and everything.

1539
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:13,465
Oh, I understand. Yeah.
Look, they're maniacs.

1540
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:15,842
- Yeah.
- Nothing easier. Follow me.

1541
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:20,097
I'm not used to this, you know.
I just gotta get out of here.

1542
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:24,434
Kind of a private person, you know.

1543
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:28,855
To tell you the truth,
I never killed anybody before.

1544
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:32,609
Having a hard time with it.

1545
01:40:34,237 --> 01:40:36,655
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

1546
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:39,950
I'm glad you did what you did.

1547
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:42,577
But I'm sorry.

1548
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:46,832
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.

1549
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,669
So, is it... Is it Jimmy? James?

1550
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:53,296
James.

1551
01:40:57,427 --> 01:40:58,885
James'll do.

1552
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:18,530
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

1553
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:22,909
Why didn't you pay the ransom?

1554
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:28,957
Well, because I was dealing
with human garbage.

1555
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,793
No contract would have been
honored, not by them.

1556
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:34,755
You know, the funny thing is,
I would have paid 10 times as much

1557
01:41:34,839 --> 01:41:37,799
if I had any sense that
they'd stick to the deal, but no.

1558
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:40,051
- Really.
- Oh, yeah. Really.

1559
01:41:40,887 --> 01:41:42,137
(CHUCKLES)

1560
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:45,557
The thing that really kills me
about that is the woman.

1561
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:47,851
She'd been in this house five, six times
over the last year.

1562
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,645
Nice. Pleasant. You know.
You just can't...

1563
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:54,065
I don't know how people
can walk around with that...

1564
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:56,943
That cold-blooded, two-faced...

1565
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:59,279
That bitch.

1566
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:02,157
Well, you know, in fairness to the dead,

1567
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,702
we're all a little two-faced
in this day and age.

1568
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:12,793
It's a survival mechanism.
You know what I'm saying?

1569
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:22,093
I mean, you know, as a cop,

1570
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:25,305
you should hear some of the stuff that's
been thrown my way over the years.

1571
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:27,265
KATHERINE: Tom, just forget
about the gloves, honey.

1572
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:28,642
He wanted to come home.

1573
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,101
- Kate...
- Hi, Tom.

1574
01:42:30,186 --> 01:42:33,271
- Mr. Shaker's here.
- Mr. Shaker.

1575
01:42:46,536 --> 01:42:49,371
God bless you. Thank you.

1576
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:53,708
- You're welcome.
- Listen, you gotta meet Sean.

1577
01:42:53,793 --> 01:42:55,377
I'll go get him.

1578
01:42:55,586 --> 01:43:00,632
No, he's, you know, had enough.
Let's give him a breather. Yeah?

1579
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:06,137
Yeah, yeah. He's had enough.

1580
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:09,391
Okay. Can I get you anything?

1581
01:43:09,475 --> 01:43:12,018
SHAKER: No, I'm fine.

1582
01:43:12,103 --> 01:43:13,520
KATHERINE:
Again, I can't even begin to...

1583
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,939
SHAKER: I understand. Don't mention it.

1584
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:19,276
Okay.

1585
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,532
KATHERINE: Fatima, would you please
help me with some things downstairs?

1586
01:43:25,616 --> 01:43:27,450
I'll be right there.

1587
01:43:34,584 --> 01:43:38,044
Well, this is one hell of a deposit
you've got here.

1588
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:40,630
Shouldn't be a problem.

1589
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:53,643
Well, you'll probably
wanna be on your way.

1590
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,897
Unless there's anything else
I can do for you.

1591
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:03,153
Good. Right.

1592
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:07,157
Well, I know how these vultures
out there can drive you nuts, so...

1593
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:08,617
You know, there's a back door out

1594
01:44:08,701 --> 01:44:09,910
if you, you know,
wanna be a little more...

1595
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,329
This check is bullshit, Tom.

1596
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:16,124
What'd you think,
I'm just gonna waltz out of here,

1597
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:18,960
you lying motherfucker? Huh?

1598
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:20,253
Let you make a phone call,

1599
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:24,257
have half the cops in New York
waiting for me while I cash this thing?

1600
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:26,301
- You can't lie to me.
- Look...

1601
01:44:26,385 --> 01:44:28,053
Shut your mouth.

1602
01:44:30,556 --> 01:44:31,723
Fuck!

1603
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:47,238
You know who I am. Now you sit down.

1604
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:51,534
Everybody was gonna make out fine.

1605
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:55,246
But you had to go and put it together,

1606
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:58,500
and now we got
a little problem here, don't we?

1607
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:03,922
Tell me that part again about
why you didn't pay the ransom.

1608
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:05,840
- I think we can do something here...
- Say it!

1609
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:08,093
You were dealing with what?

1610
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:11,388
You had my son.

1611
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:14,224
You have no idea
what human garbage is, motherfucker.

1612
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:18,269
Do you know what the fuck you're
talking about? No, I don't think you do.

1613
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:20,730
'Cause look
where you fucking live, man.

1614
01:45:20,815 --> 01:45:22,649
Look at the airline man here.

1615
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:26,569
This fucker won't pay one cent
to save his only kid.

1616
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:28,196
It wasn't gonna get him back, was it?

1617
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,323
Hey, did you read the papers? Huh?

1618
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:31,866
Did you see the TV?

1619
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:35,328
I took a bullet.
I risked my life to save your kid.

1620
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:39,165
I took a bullet, and now you're gonna
try to fuck me out of my money. Huh?

1621
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,001
- What's over here?
- Where are you going?

1622
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:42,252
Where's Mommy and Junior?

1623
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:44,963
- Now I'll pay. Now.
- Oh, yeah.

1624
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:48,133
You're gonna pay, all right. Right now.

1625
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:50,427
Do you have an account
I can wire the money to?

1626
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:52,303
I mean, you got to have been
all set up for this, right?

1627
01:45:52,388 --> 01:45:56,641
I mean, you're not dumb. You and me,
we go right now to my bank,

1628
01:45:57,018 --> 01:45:59,019
and we wire the money
from my account to yours.

1629
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:01,104
Just the push of a button. Just like that.

1630
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:04,649
We'll just go down to the bank
and get it done.

1631
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,737
Pick up the phone. Wire it from here.

1632
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,951
No, we'll go to the bank and do it.

1633
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:20,582
And you'll get the money and all I want
in return is you out of this house now.

1634
01:46:23,502 --> 01:46:26,296
Hey. You do not call the shots.

1635
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:29,174
Well, then, you just go ahead
and kill me right here and now,

1636
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:31,259
you son of a bitch.

1637
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:34,888
You fuck! Fuck you!
I'm not picking up that phone.

1638
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:37,015
You got that? I'm not picking it up.

1639
01:46:38,559 --> 01:46:42,145
Look, you can kill me.
Go ahead. Kill me. Just kill us.

1640
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,731
Let us live. Doesn't matter.
Any way you cut it, you're on the run.

1641
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,191
Now, you can come with me
to the bank

1642
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:48,193
