01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,088
Listen. About this...

1040
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:27,520
Doreen thing.

1041
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,762
She'll be all right, I think.

1042
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,769
Kids are resilient, you know?

1043
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,731
And, uh, this thing with Richie, I mean,
Christ, that was bloody awful.

1044
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,404
I don't know what Cyrus was thinking,
but a man's got to make a living.

1045
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,770
I tried to keep you out...

1046
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,806
but you insisted on this
<i>post facto</i> big-brother thing.

1047
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,411
So I figured...

1048
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,489
if I left enough dangling...

1049
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,160
you would find my disc for me.

1050
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,130
What a mess, eh?

1051
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,846
All over a shiny piece of plastic.

1052
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,000
Listen.

1053
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,523
I'll get rid of the disc.

1054
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,566
You got rid of
everything else, so...

1055
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:26,725
You may have hardware
concealed about your person.

1056
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,566
But remember:

1057
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:32,367
You kill me, you'll be on the
run for the rest of your life.

1058
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,888
It's been nice knowing you, Jack.

1059
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,246
CARTER: Brumby.

1060
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:46,283
I'm not turning around.

1061
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,487
Suit yourself.

1062
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,404
DOREEN: Uncle Jack.

1063
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,527
CARTER: Your mother told
me I'd find you here.

1064
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:30,245
- I thought you were gone.
- I am gone. I just wanted to...

1065
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,562
say goodbye to you, face to face.

1066
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,724
- What happened to your beard thing?
- Oh, that?

1067
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:45,562
I thought it was time for a
change. I just got rid of it.

1068
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,844
Did you fall again?

1069
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,566
This?

1070
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,888
Yeah, I did. I fell down again.

1071
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,530
I'll get new shoes.

1072
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:05,770
We'll be okay, you know.

1073
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:08,285
Mom and me.

1074
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:09,966
I know.

1075
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:14,643
Thanks for being here.
It would've meant a lot to Dad.

1076
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,048
- He was a good man.
- Yeah.

1077
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,880
Guess you gotta go?

1078
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,241
Yeah.

1079
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:32,481
Remember when
I said you're special?

1080
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,287
You better remember or you'll
have a big problem with me.

1081
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,527
Okay.

1082
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,843
Take care of yourself, Doreen.

1083
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,081
You too.

1084
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,367
Hey.

1085
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,450
I like the new look.

1086
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:08,366
Yeah.

1087
