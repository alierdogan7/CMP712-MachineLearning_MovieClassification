[Loudspeaker, people chattering]

6
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,727
- You okay?
- I'm fine, mate. Don't worry about it.

7
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,806
You all right?

8
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,174
Enjoy L.A.

[Men yelling in Spanish]

11
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,235
He did it.

12
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:31,340
[Silence]

13
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,317
- [Man] Everything's always about you.
- [Woman] It's not.

14
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:12,050
That gearhead was being sarcastic
and you know it.

15
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,456
- I just didn't see it that way.
- Bullshit.

16
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,688
What about the dig
about the makeover?

17
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,629
What do you want me to do?
I work with him, for chrissake.

18
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,132
You're capable of taking care
of your own shit.

19
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,727
You know something? Last time I checked,
you were sleeping with me.

20
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,739
So unless you want to start fucking him,
I suggest...

21
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,506
[both speaking Spanish]

22
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,964
Hey, pal. Where can I catch a shuttle
to the airport around here?

23
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,558
- Right there.
- Thanks.

24
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,475
It was him in that gold Lexus
with the cell phone.

25
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,046
Are they still asking for
a change of venue?

26
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,388
He's enhanceable because
of priors in the early '80s.

27
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,731
- Where to?
- Downtown. 312 North Spring Street.

28
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,130
Downtown.

29
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,266
Look, the transcriptions need to be done
by 7 a.m., period, okay?

30
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,673
Hold on. Take Sepulveda
to Slauson to La Brea.

31
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,046
Take La Brea north to 6th,
into downtown.

32
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,880
So what? You'll be up late.

33
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,615
I'm pulling an all-nighter too,
so save the tears.

34
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,556
- I'll take 105 east to the 110. It's faster.
- What?

35
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,219
The 105 to the 110
will get you there quicker.

36
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,889
The 110 turns into a parking lot
around USC.

37
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,162
But once you get to La Brea
north of Santa Monica, it's jammed.

38
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,672
The 110 north of the 10, you get people
driving to Pasadena and they drive slow.

39
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,436
Yeah, they do, but what I do is
I get off on Grand and then I...

40
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,808
Surface roads is what you want,
that's what we'll do.

41
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,086
Are we taking bets?

42
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,089
- Are we?
- And what if you're wrong?

43
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,683
I don't think I'll be wrong,
but if I am...

44
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,557
...your ride's free.

45
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,397
Okay, you got yourself a deal.

46
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,650
- Go ahead, say it.
- Say what?

47
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,230
- Go ahead.
- I got lucky with the lights.

48
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,629
You weren't lucky.
What you were was right.

49
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,963
I was wrong...

50
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,037
...Max.

51
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,915
You mind turning that up?

52
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,450
You like the classics.

53
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,783
- I do. I used to play in high school.
- Let me guess. Woodwinds.

54
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,858
No. Strings. Never had the lungs
for wind instruments.

55
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,394
Could've fooled me the way you were
unloading on that cell phone.

56
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,258
[Woman] Different instrument.

57
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:16,195
If you had just listened to me, we'd be
all bogged down in traffic right now,

58
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,532
and you would've made
an extra five bucks.

59
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:23,007
Yeah, well, you keep that 5 bucks.
Buy you something special. Go wild.

60
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,205
Really, it's not a big deal.
Nothing big here.

61
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,113
How many cabbies do you know get you
into an argument to save you money?

62
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,617
There were two of us.
I had to kill the other one.

63
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,687
I don't like competition.

64
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,686
Take pride in being good
at what you do?

65
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,491
What, this?
No, this is part-time.

66
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,362
This is a fill-in job.
Pay the bills.

67
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,529
But I will be the best at what I do.
But that's something else.

68
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,610
- What else?
- Just shaping up some things.

69
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,441
Like...?

70
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,782
Tell me.

71
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,579
Limo company I'm putting together.
Island Limos.

72
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,520
It'll be like a island on wheels.
A cool groove, like a club experience.

73
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,990
When you get to the airport,
you won't want to get out of my limo.

74
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,926
So I do this part-time
to get my Benz off leases...

75
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,396
staff up, get the right client list.
You know, things like that.

76
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,433
How do you like being a lawyer?

77
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,340
- What are you, psychic?
- Little bit.

78
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,410
There's the dark pinstripe suit.

79
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,275
Elegant, not too flashy.
That rules out advertising.

80
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,008
Plus a top-drawer briefcase
that you live out of.

81
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,279
And the purse. A Bottega.

82
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,252
Anyway, a man gets in my cab with
a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.

83
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,053
- [Laughing]
- You?

84
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,794
Clarence Darrow.

85
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,855
Well, no, not quite. He worked defense.
I'm a prosecutor.

86
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,400
- Big case?
- Yeah.

87
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,743
[Sighs]

88
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,210
- Got us here fast.
- Of course.

89
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,908
But you didn't answer my question.

90
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,080
You like what you do?

91
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,154
Yeah.

92
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,060
But not today.

93
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,561
No, I do. Like, I can't wait.

94
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,432
I love standing in that courtroom.

95
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,799
At the same time, I get this...

96
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,634
...clenched up thing
the night before the first days.

97
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,267
Clenched up? How?

98
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,550
I think I'm going to lose.

99
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,650
I think the case sucks,
my exhibits aren't in order,

100
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,595
I'm not prepared enough, people will
find out I don't know what I'm doing

101
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,258
and I've been running a charade
all these years.

102
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,461
I represent the Department of Justice,

103
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,131
and my opening statement will fall flat
at the most important point

104
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,333
and the jury will laugh at me.

105
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,610
And then I cry.
I don't throw up.

106
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,549
A lot of people throw up.
I have a strong stomach.

107
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,817
And then I pull myself together,
I rewrite my opening statement...

108
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,552
work my exhibits and that's what I do
for the rest of the night.

109
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,561
That's my routine.

110
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,496
In the morning it starts and I'm fine.

111
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,662
You need a vacation.

112
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,172
I just had a vacation
on the Harbor Freeway.

113
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,834
Not in a cab.
You need to get your head straight.

114
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,379
Get your unified self up.
Get harmonic, you know...

115
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,643
- When did you last take a break?
- I go on vacation all the time.

116
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,184
- How often?
- A dozen times a day.

117
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,379
My favorite spot:

118
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,550
Maldives Islands.

119
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,657
It's my own private getaway.

120
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:41,825
Things get heavy for me, I take
five minutes out and I just go there.

121
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,732
And I just concentrate
on absolutely nothing.

122
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,641
- Here. Take it.
- I couldn't do that.

123
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,773
Take it because you need it
a lot more than I do.

124
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,113
And it'll help you.
I guarantee it.

125
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,497
Thanks, Max.

126
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,663
Go get 'em.

128
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,434
Hey.

129
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,700
I don't know...

130
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,210
In case you ever want to investigate

131
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,907
a Fortune 500 company, or...

132
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,445
...argue cab routes.

135
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,149
Hey.

136
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,624
Come on, man, I'm sorry.

137
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,252
I didn't hear you, man. Come on.

138
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,990
I'll take you.

139
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,572
- Where to?
- 1039 South Union Street.

140
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,573
Gotcha.

141
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,520
- [Man] How long you think this'll take?
- [Max] Seven minutes.

142
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,824
Seven. Not eight? Not six?

143
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,026
Two minutes from the 110 to Normandie.
Normandie to Venice, three minutes.

144
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,659
Over to Union is one,
plus one for "shit happens."

145
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,897
- Okay if I time you?
- Knock yourself out.

146
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,031
What do I get if you're wrong?
A free ride?

147
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,575
An apology.
Already offered my free ride today.

148
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,338
- To who?
- Some girl.

149
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,582
Did you get a date with her?

150
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,310
First time in L.A.?

151
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,616
No. Tell you the truth, whenever
I'm here I can't wait to leave.

152
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,619
It's too sprawled out, disconnected.
You know? That's me.

153
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,820
- You like it?
- It's my home.

154
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,954
17 million people.

155
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:36,660
It's the fifth biggest economy in the world
and nobody knows each other.

156
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,102
I read about this guy
gets on the MTA here, dies.

157
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,365
[Max] Oh.

158
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,772
Six hours he rides the subway
before anyone notices his corpse

159
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,904
doing laps around L.A.,
people on and off sitting next to him.

160
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,482
Nobody notices.

161
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,421
[Man] This is the cleanest cab
I've ever been in.

162
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,014
[Man] Regular ride?

163
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,320
Yeah, I share it
with the day shift guy.

164
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,895
[Man] You prefer nights?

165
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,432
People are more relaxed.
Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

166
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,627
- [Man] How are the benefits?
- It's not that kind of job.

167
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,366
I'm not in this for the long haul.
Just filling in.

168
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,941
Temporary while I get
some things shaped up.

169
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,509

00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,873
I'm afraid it is. Step out the vehicle.
You too. Come on.

338
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,542
- If you open that trunk, they go inside.
- You know what, it's been a long night.

339
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,348
Plus, the barn is right up there.
Just give me a break.

340
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,888
This is my first fare.

341
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,117
Get out the cab.
Open the trunk.

342
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,687
Step out.
You too, sir. Please.

Don't blow it.

- Lenny, what's up? It's me.
- <i>Just got off the phone with the cops.</i>

<i>You're paying.</i>

It was an accident.
You're not liable.

It was an accident.
I'm not liable.

366
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,034
<i>I'm making you liable.</i>
<i>It's coming out of your pocket.</i>

367
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,232
Tell him to stick this cab
up his fat ass.

368
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,172
- I can't. That's my boss.
- So?

Albert Riccardo, Asst. U.S. Attorney.

00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,558
A passenger in this cab

<i>[Lenny] Let's not get excited.</i>

376

How do I not get excited, listening to you
try to extort a working man?

377
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,434
You know goddamn well
your collision policy

378

will cover the damages.

you sarcastic prick?

00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,836
- <i>[Lenny] I was just...</i>
- Tell it to him.

381
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,436
Here, tell him he's an asshole.
Go ahead.

382
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,572
You're an asshole.

383
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:36,313
Tell him he pulls this shit again,
you'll stick this yellow cab up his fat ass.

384

up your fat ass.

Chet Baker. Like that.

00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,730
Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him
in Bellflower last night.

I roll here, find this.

- Four months. He's a low-level player.

Feds are all over him,
don't want us anywhere near it.

Since when's LAPD
working for the Feeb?

454
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,554
They'll just take our stuff,
build their case, take the credit.

455
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,682
- What's the point?
- The point is my guy flew out a window.

456
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:46,286
So if my CI flies out a window,
he's got Felix's handprints on his ass.

457
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,864
That makes it mine.

458
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,594
Is there a crime here? A homicide?
You got a body?

459
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,501
- Just a bunch of broken glass.
- And blood.

460
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,042
Down here, in the glass.
Here's some more.

461
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:02,704

over there and over here.

- Yeah, it's me.

Ramone went through that window...
splat.

464
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,759
Glass here, then tires rolled over it.

465
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,026
Maybe he jumped.

466
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,194
Sure. He's depressed so he jumps four
stories out of a window onto his head.

467
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,670
"That feels better."
Picks himself up.

468
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,106
"Now I think I'll go on
with the rest of my day."

469
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,200
- Come on, man.
- Hey, Ray!

470
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,677

says he saw a cab earlier tonight

- with two guys walking around the hood.
- Description? He see anything?

474
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:55,089
Kind of saw. Guy's got glasses
like Coke bottles.

475

Okay. Keep knocking.
Let's keep knocking.

Remember that Bay Area deal? Oakland?

479
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,206
Cabby drove around all night,
killed three people,

480
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,009
- then put the gun to his head.
- He flipped out. So what?

481
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,346
So that Oakland detective
never bought it.

482
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,444
Cabby had no criminal record
or history of mental illness.

483
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,149
Pops three people, then himself?

484
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:25,484
Anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.

[Jazz music plays]

486
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,592
I never learned to listen to jazz.

487
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:05,200
It's off melody. Behind the notes.
Not what's expected.

488
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,760
- Improvising, like tonight.
- Like tonight?

489
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,260

00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,062
same job, place, routine.
Everything the same.

ten minutes from now.

as to invite him over after his set?

497
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,097
- I got to buy him a drink.
- Sure thing, darling.

bussing tables right here.

00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,419
It was about being around the music.
And I was.

501
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:39,360
Take this one night. July 22nd, 1964.
Who you think walks through that door?

502
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,260
[Woman] Bye, baby.

503
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,698
- Miles Davis. That's right.
- In the flesh?

504
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,329
I'm talking about through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.

505
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,736
Jesus.

506
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,300
Anyway, he had been recording a session
up at Columbia, up on Vine.

507
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,538
So Miles comes through that door.

508
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:00,845
Before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.

509
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,646
I mean, it had to be...

510
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:06,712
Oh, it was scary.
I mean, the dude was so focused, man.

511
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,224
Plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway.

512
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:13,854
Everybody and their mama knew you don't
just come up and talk to Miles Davis.

513
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,422
I mean, he may have looked like
he was chilling, but he was absorbed.

514
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,700
This one young, hip couple, one of them
tried to shake his hand one day.

515
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,172
And the guy says,
"Hi, my name is..."

516
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,245
Miles said, "Get out of my face,
you jive motherfucker.

517
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,813
Take your silly bitch with you."

518
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,007
[Both laugh]

519
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,983
You know? That was Miles, man.

520
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:39,385
That's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. Fierce.

521
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,618
- But did you get to talk to him?
- Better than that.

522
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,217
I played for about 20 minutes.

523
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,887
[Vincent] Unbelievable.

524
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,692
- How'd you do?
- How'd I do?

525
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,632
You really ain't shit
playing next to Miles Davis.

526
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,225
But he carried my ass.

527
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,066
[Vincent] What'd he say?

528
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,834
He said one word: Cool.

529
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,307
Cool?

530
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,877
- That's it?
- Yeah.

531
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,344
That meant, "Good, but not ready."

532
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,041
It meant, "Look me up when you are."

533
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,549
Did you?

534
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:12,486
No. I got drafted
and got into some other things.

535
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,425
And by the time I got back to music,
season had passed.

536
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,090
You know, I was born in 1945,

537
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,964
but that night was the moment
of my conception.

538
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,163
- Right here in this room.
- Crowd's not here now.

539
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,571
Well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.

540
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,768
What a great story.

541
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:40,111
I got to tell the people in Culiacan
and Cartagena that story.

542
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,529
You know the folks
in Culiacan and Cartagena?

543
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,193
Afraid so.

544
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,094
Just when I thought
you were a cool guy.

545
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,664
I am a cool guy with a job
I contracted to do.

546
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:09,143
- Come on, give the dude a pass.
- I'm working here.

547
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,680
You're the one talking
about improvisation.

548
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,808
You like the guy, how he plays.
Let's just play a little jazz.

549
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,910
Improvi...
That's funny coming from you.

550
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,551
How's this?

551
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,689
- I'll ask a question.
- [Daniel] What question?

552
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,232
A jazz question.

553
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:34,100
Now, you get it right, we roll.

554
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,570
You disappear tonight.

555
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,699
If I walk out of here tonight,

556
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,836
I will go so far away,
it'll be just like I was dead.

557
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:47,440
And one more thing: These people
and their rep here, Felix...

558
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,782
Well, you tell them I'm sorry.

559
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:55,518
You tell them I had to.
They laid a grant of immunity on me.

560
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,390
It was either play ball
or go back inside.

561
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,056
And I'm not going back inside.

562
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,494
Yeah.

563
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,541
Lay it on me.

564
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,008
Where did Miles learn music?

565
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,046
- I know everything about Miles.
- Then let's have it.

566
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,810
Music school.
He got into music school, right?

567
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,148
His father was a dentist,
east St. Louis.

568
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,813
Invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.

569
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:31,623
He sent Miles to Juilliard School
of Music, New York, 1945.

570
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,026
Man.

571
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,537
Dropped out in less than a year, tracked
down Charlie Parker on 52nd Street

572
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,173
who mentored him
for the next three years.

573
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,902
Hey.

574
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,873
- No, I'm done. Find you another cab.
- Max.

575
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,608
Leave me alone.
I'm collateral, anyway.

576
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,980
[Grunting]

577
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,013
[Max panting]

578
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,249
I am not playing.

579
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,628
You played him, man.

580
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,423
He got the answer right...

581
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,899
...would you have let him go?

582
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:50,370
<i>[Lenny on radio] 102. Max.</i>

583
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,442
What is it with this guy?

584
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,981
- You hassling my driver again?
- <i>Who are you?</i>

585
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,717
The same guy you talked to last time.

586
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,193
<i>Max's mother's driving me crazy.</i>
<i>Put him on the line, please.</i>

587
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,820
Hang on.

588
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,264
Carefully.

589
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,435
Yeah?

590
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,164
<i>Your mother's calling.</i>
<i>"Why didn't you show?</i>

591
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,332
- <i>Are you all right? Where are you?"</i>
- [Vincent] Show for what?

592
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,577
Tell her I can't make it tonight.

593
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,909
<i>I'm not related to you.</i>
<i>Tell her yourself.</i>

594
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,914
Show up for what?

595
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,613
She's in the hospital.

596
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,587
- You visit every night?
- Yeah. What's the difference?

597
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,920
- You don't show up, it breaks routine.
- So?

598
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:46,189
So people start looking for you, this cab.
That's not good.

599
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,166
I'm not taking you to see my mother.

600
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,637
Since when was any of this negotiable.

601
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,506
Two paces ahead, one to the left.

602
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,117
Flowers?

603
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,486
It's a waste of money.
Won't mean a thing to her.

604
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,154
She carried you in her womb
for nine months.

605
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,059
People buy flowers. Buy flowers.

606
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,864
Excuse me.

607
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,871
Keep the change.

608
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,569
[Bell rings]

609
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,779
[Man] Hold that elevator, please.

610
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,183
- Floor?
- Five. Thanks.

611
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,402
- Having a good night?
- <i>Mezzo mezzo.</i>

612
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,302
You?

613
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,613
Excuse me.

614
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,510
Hey, Ma.

615
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,615
I've been calling and calling.

616
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,715
- I got caught up at work.
- Why couldn't you call me?

617
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,159
I'm lying here wondering if something
terrible happened to you.

618
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,163
- I brought you flowers.
- What am I gonna do with flowers?

619
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,823
- Cheer up.
- How?

620
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:08,701
By worrying that you spend money
on stuff that's just going to wilt and die?

621
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,202
See what I mean?

622
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,276
I didn't buy you the flowers. He did.

623
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,935
Who?

624
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,516
Why didn't you tell me we had company?

625
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:28,023
What's your name?
Sorry my son is rude.

626
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,252
No harm done, ma'am.

627
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,760
You paid for my flowers?

628
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,888
They're beautiful.

629
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,736
Well, Max?

630
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:52,145
Mother, this is Vincent.
Vincent, this is my mother, Ida.

631
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,415
I am very happy to meet you,
Mrs. Durocher.

632
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,352
[Chuckling] Oh, just call me Ida.

633
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,755
Ida. I was with Max
when he got the call.

634
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:07,286
- [Lda] You came here to see me?
- [Vincent] It's nothing, ma'am.

635
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,887
Tell my son.

636
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:13,163
You have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.

637
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,501
You must be one of
Max's important clients.

638
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:20,372
Client? You know, I like to think
of myself as his friend.

639
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,803
[Lda] Max never had many friends.

640
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,314
Always talking to himself in the mirror.
It's unhealthy.

641
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,384
How many times I got to ask
don't do that?

642
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:29,452
Do what?

643
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,784
Don't talk about me like
I'm not right here in the room here.

644
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,186
What's he saying?

645
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,852
[Vincent] He says he's standing
right here in the room here.

646
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:41,124
Yes, you are.
He's sensitive.

647
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,598
I know. But I'm sure
you're very proud of him.

648
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:48,660
Of course I'm proud.
He started with nothing, you know?

649
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,865
Look at him today.
Here, Vegas...

650
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:55,104
Mom, he is not interested in hearing
about all that, okay?

651
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:58,909
I came to see you, I saw you,
you look good, let's go.

652
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,040
I am very interested, Ida. Please.

653
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,120
- Limousine companies.
- Is that right?

654
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,348
He drives famous people around.

655
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,788
Famous people. Limousine companies.

656
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,417
Now, that's quite an achievement.

657
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:15,862
- [Lda] What did you say your name was?
- My name's Vincent, ma'am.

658
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,126
Visit again?

659
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,327
[Vincent] No, I'm just in town tonight.

660
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,530
- [Lda] When you come back.
- [Vincent] Sure.

661
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,623
Max!

662
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,296
Don't!

663
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,264
[Max screams]

664
00:53:55,365 --> 00:54:00,132
All my prep was in there.
You are screwing with my work.

665
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,263
[Ragged breathing]

666
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,942
Let's see what else you can do.

667
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,670
[Max groans]
