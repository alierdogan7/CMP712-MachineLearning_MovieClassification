1
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:37,880
Now, you remember, children,
how I told you

2
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:41,318
about the good Lord going up into the
mountain and talking to the people?

3
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:45,605
And how he said: "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God"?

4
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:48,679
And how he said
that King Solomon in all his glory

5
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:51,725
was not as beautiful as
the lilies of the field?

6
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:55,322
And I know you won't forget
"Judge not lest ye be judged",

7
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:57,438
because I explained that to you.

8
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,757
And then the good Lord went on to say:

9
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,318
"Beware of false prophets

10
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,356
which come to you in sheep's clothing

11
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,281
but inwardly they are ravening wolves".

12
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,356
"Ye shall know them by their fruits".

13
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,958
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,

14
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,358
45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70,

15
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:20,605
75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100!

16
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,758
Here I come, ready or not.

17
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:26,478
What's wrong?

18
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,640
"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,

19
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:44,804
neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit".

20
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:48,637
"Wherefore by their fruits
ye shall know them".

21
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:53,718
Well now, what's it to be, Lord?

22
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,198
Another widow?

23
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,558
How many's it been? Six?

24
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:01,198
Twelve?

25
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,638
I disremember.

26
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,117
You say the word, Lord. I'm on my way.

27
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:21,002
You always send me money
to go forth and preach your word.

28
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:26,396
A widow with a little wad of bills
hid away in the sugar bowl.

29
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,798
Lord, I am tired.

30
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:42,880
Sometimes I wonder
if you really understand.

31
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:48,675
Not that you mind the killings.
Your book is full of killings.

32
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,917
But there are things you do hate, Lord.

33
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:53,998
Perfume-smelling things.

34
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,677
Lacy things. Things with curly hair.

35
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:41,918
There are too many of them.

36
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,198
You can't kill a world.

37
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,964
You driving a touring car
with a Moundsville licence?

38
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:51,515
Harry Powell,
for the theft of that touring car

39
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:54,599
you'll spend 30 days
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

40
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:58,646
- Preacher Harry Powell.
- A car thief. Picked up where you were.

41
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:02,239
A man of God? Harry Powell...

42
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:25,839
Hold Miss Jenny still.

43
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,918
Stand still, Miss Jenny.

44
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:32,157
There. What's so hard about that?

45
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,958
Daddy!

46
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,357
- Where's your mom?
- Out shopping.

47
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:47,956
You're bleeding, Dad.

48
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:52,677
Listen. We have to hide this money before
they get to me. There's close to $10,000.

49
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,600
Where? Under a rock
in the smokehouse? No, no.

50
00:05:56,127 --> 00:06:00,006
Under the bricks in the grape arbour.
No, no. They'd dig for it.

51
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,358
Sure. That's the place.

52
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:10,558
- That's him.
- He probably still has that gun.

53
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:14,124
Listen to me, son. You've got to swear.
Swear means promise.

54
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,324
First swear you'll take care of little
Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy.

55
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:20,001
Then swear you won't never tell where
the money's hid. Not even your mom.

56
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:21,406
- Yes, Dad.
- You understand?

57
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:24,126
- Not even her?
- You've got common sense, she ain't.

58
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:26,163
When you grow up
that money'll belong to you.

59
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:28,886
Now stand up straight.
Raise your right hand.

60
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:33,199
- Now swear. I'll guard Pearl with my life.
- I will guard Pearl with my life.

61
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:38,202
- And I won't never tell about the money.
- And I won't never tell about the money.

62
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:40,478
You, Pearl. You swear too.

63
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,478
Ben Harper.

64
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:48,447
I'm going now, children. Goodbye.

65
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:50,722
Drop that gun, Harper.
We don't want the kids hurt.

66
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,321
Just mind what you swore, son.
Mind, boy.

67
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,718
Don't.

68
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:01,078
Don't!

69
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,438
Dad.

70
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,560
Ben Harper, it is the sentence of this court

71
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,000
that for the murder of Ed Smiley
and Corey South

72
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,760
you be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

73
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,958
May God have mercy on your soul.

74
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,838
I got you all buffaloed.

75
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:49,241
You ain't none of you
gonna get it out of me.

76
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:51,718
Where, Ben? Where?

77
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:54,403
Where?

78
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:56,637
And a little child shall lead them.

79
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,238
Come on, boy. Tell me.

80
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,845
Ben! I'm a man of God.

81
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:08,839
- Making me talk about it in my sleep.
- No, Ben. No.

82
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:10,918
What did I say?

83
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,759
You was quoting the scripture, Ben.

84
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,680
You said
"And a little child shall lead them".

85
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:25,278
You killed two men, Ben Harper.

86
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,881
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank

87
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:33,087
cos I got tired of seeing children
roaming the woodlands without food.

88
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:37,516
Children roaming the highways
in this year of Depression.

89
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:41,037
Children sleeping in old abandoned
car bodies on junk heaps.

90
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:44,358
I promised myself I'd never see
the day when my young 'uns would want.

91
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:46,677
With that $10,000
I could build a tabernacle

92
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,998
and make that Wheeling Island tabernacle
look like a chicken house.

93
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:52,237
Would you have free candy for the kids?

94
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:55,319
Think of it, Ben.
With that cursed, bloody gold.

95
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:59,085
How come you got that stick-knife
hid up in your blankets, Preacher?

96
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:02,716
The Lord blinded mine enemies when
they brought me in this evil place.

97
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:06,083
I smuggled it in right under
the noses of them guards.

98
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,158
"I come not with peace,

99
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,837
- but with a sword".
- You, Preacher?

100
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:16,835
The sword has served me through
many an evil time, Ben Harper.

101
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:22,881
What religion do you profess, Preacher?

102
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:26,926
The religion the Almighty and me
worked out betwixt us.

103
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:29,398
I'll bet!

104
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:34,200
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.

105
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,563
Keep talking, Preacher.

106
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:38,603
If you let that money serve the Lord,

107
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:41,406
- he might feel kindly towards you.
- Keep talking.

108
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:45,605
Now, don't you think the Lord might
change his mind if you was to...

109
00:09:55,447 --> 00:10:00,077
Lord, you sure knowed
what you was doing

110
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:03,644
when you put me
in this very cell at this very time.

111
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:11,038
A man with $10,000 hid somewhere -
and a widow in the making.

112
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:28,680
- Any trouble?
- No.

113
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:30,962
He was a cool one, that Harper.
Never broke.

114
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,038
Carried on some. Kicked.

115
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:36,364
- They say he left a wife and two kids.
- I never heard.

116
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,923
- He never told about the money?
- No.

117
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,077
What do you figure he done with it?

118
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:46,120
He took the secret with him
when I dropped him.

119
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:51,157
That you, Bart? Supper's waiting.

120
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:09,165
Mother, sometimes I think it might be
better if I was to quit my job as guard.

121
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:13,798
You're always this way when there's a
hanging. You never have to be there.

122
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:18,002
Sometimes I wish I was back in the mine.

123
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:21,318
And leave me a widow after
another blast like the one in '24?

124
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,398
Not on your life, old mister.

125
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:43,245
<i>Hing, hang, hung</i>

126
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,716
<i>See what the hangman done</i>

127
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:51,758
See what the hangman done

128
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:53,758
Hung, hang, hing

129
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,803
See the robber swing

130
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:00,920
Hing, hang, hung

131
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:02,998
Now my song is done

132
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,637
Are you going to buy it, John?

133
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:30,916
So your mommy's
keeping you out of school.

134
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:33,318
How is your poor, poor mother?

135
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,723
She's at Spoon's ice-cream parlour.

136
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:41,245
Did they ever find out what your father
done with all that money he stole?

137
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,758
Pearl and me, we have to go.

138
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:53,003
- You'd better not sing that song.
- Why?

139
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,078
Cos you're too little.

140
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,165
Can we get some candy?

141
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,358
No.

142
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:08,166
Willa Harper, there are certain
plain facts of life that adds up

143
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:11,125
just like two plus two makes four,
and one of them is this.

144
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,960
No woman is able to raise
growing youngsters alone.

145
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:18,837
- The Lord meant that job for two.
- Icey, I just don't want a husband.

146
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:29,326
T'ain't a question of wanting
or not wanting.

147
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:30,840
You've got two little young 'uns.

148
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:33,680
It's a man you need in the house,
Willa Harper.

149
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,438
Tell me a story, John.

150
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:53,080
Well, once upon a time...

151
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:58,443
there was a rich king
who had himself a son and a daughter.

152
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:03,161
They all lived in a castle over in Africa.

153
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:11,319
Then one day this king
got taken away by some bad men.

154
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:17,916
Before he got took off he told his son to
kill anyone who tried to steal his gold.

155
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,320
And before long,
the bad men came back and...

156
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,558
Just a man.

157
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:47,402
Good night, Pearl.
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.

158
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,399
Night, Miss Jenny.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

159
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:48,517
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing
no more but she still blows as she passes.

160
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,677
Come on in and have a cup of coffee, boy.

161
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,998
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.

162
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:01,366
Ain't nobody going to neither,
as long as Uncle Birdie's round.

163
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:08,241
First day my joints is limber enough I'll
haul her out and give her a good caulking.

164
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:13,236
- Ain't seen you in a coon's age, boy.
- I've been minding Pearl.

165
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:18,162
Ain't it a caution what a woman'll load
onto a man's back when he ain't looking?

166
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:33,640
Excuse me, Cap, while I...
sweeten my coffee.

167
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:48,439
Dead and gone these twenty-five year
and never takes her eyes off me.

168
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,999
Man of my years needs a little snort
in the morning to heat the boilers.

169
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:57,285
Yeah.

170
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:01,997
I was talking to this stranger up at
the boarding house. He knowed your dad.

171
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,322
- Where'd he know Dad?
- I'll not hide it.

172
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:07,080
He knowed him
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

173
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:11,046
- I've got to go now, Uncle Birdie.
- Why, you just got here, boy.

174
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,881
I told Mom I'd be back
to Spoon's for Pearl.

175
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:40,323
God works in a mysterious way
his wonders to perform.

176
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:44,124
Yes, I was with Brother Harper
right up to the end.

177
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:46,757
Now that I'm no longer employed by
the penitentiary

178
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:49,441
it is my joy to bring this
small comfort to his loved ones.

179
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,961
It's a mighty good man
would go out of his way

180
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:54,720
to bring a word of cheer
to a grieving widow.

181
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,879
So you ain't with the state no more?

182
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,923
No, brother, I resigned only yesterday.

183
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:03,319
The heart-rending spectacle of them
poor men was just too much for me.

184
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,036
Ah, little lad,
you're staring at my fingers.

185
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,881
Would you like me to tell you the little
story of Right-hand, Left-hand?

186
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,958
The story of good and evil.

187
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:14,718
H-A-T-E.

188
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:16,126
It was with this left hand

189
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:19,483
that old Brother Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

190
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,558
L-O-V-E.

191
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:26,278
See these fingers, dear hearts? They has
veins that run straight to the soul of man.

192
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,961
The right hand, friends.
The hand of love.

193
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,841
Now watch and
I'll show you the story of life.

194
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:35,681
These fingers is always a-warring and
a-tugging, one agin t'other.

195
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,958
Now watch 'em.

196
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:40,878
Old Brother Left-hand.

197
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,798
Left-hand hates a-fighting.

198
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,878
And it looks like Love's a goner.

199
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:47,238
But wait a minute!

200
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:50,523
Hot dog! Love's a-winning.

201
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:54,122
Yes, sirree. It's Love that won.

202
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:57,400
And old Left-hand Hate
is down for the count.

203
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,558
I never heard it better told.

204
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:06,202
I wish every soul in this community
could get the benefit.

205
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,166
You've just got to stay
for our picnic Sunday.

206
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:13,364
No, I must wend my way downriver
on the Lord's business.

207
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:15,961
You ain't leaving in no hurry
if we can help it.

208
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,844
John, mind your manners!

209
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:20,316
Take that look off your face. Act nice.

210
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:23,121
He don't mean no impudence,
do you, boy?

211
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,758
Do you, boy?

212
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:29,084
Many's the time poor Brother Ben
told me about these young 'uns.

213
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,520
What did he tell you?

214
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:34,077
He told me what fine little lambs
you and your sister both was.

215
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,759
Is that all?

216
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:38,759
Why, no, boy.
He told me lots and lots of things.

217
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,638
- Nice things, boy.
- Thank you.

218
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,841
My, that fudge smells yummy.

219
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:49,804
It's for the picnic.

220
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:54,563
<i>And you don't get a smidgen of my fudge
unless you stay for the picnic.</i>

221
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:39,921
Don't he have the grandest singing voice?

222
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,521
John! Pearl!
Run along and play, you two.

223
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:45,401
- Where?
- Down by the river. My goodness!

224
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:51,518
That fella's aching to settle down with
some nice woman and make a home.

225
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:54,395
Icey, it's awful soon after Ben's passing.

226
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,557
If ever I saw a sign from heaven...

227
00:20:57,607 --> 00:21:00,519
- John don't like him much.
- Pearl dotes on him.

228
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:02,798
The boy worries me.

229
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,596
I know it's silly, but it's like there's
something still between him and his dad.

230
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,678
What he needs is a dose of salts.

231
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:11,516
- Oh, there's something else.
- What?

232
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:13,037
The money.

233
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:17,245
I declare, Willa Harper, you'll let
that money haunt you to your grave.

234
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:18,999
Icey, I would love to be satisfied

235
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:21,840
that Harry Powell don't think
I got that money hid somewhere.

236
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:24,441
You come right out
and ask that man of God.

237
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:28,920
Mr Powell! Clear that evil mud
out of your soul.

238
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,796
John! Pearl!
Come along here and get some fudge.

239
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:35,401
- I don't want no fudge.
- You do what you're told!

240
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:37,239
You go set down by the river.

241
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:40,000
- Oh, Icey, I'm a sight.
- Get along with you!

242
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:47,358
You...!

243
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:53,921
That young lady better look sharp or
some smart sister is gonna snap him up.

244
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:55,998
She's not the only fish in the river!

245
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:59,079
Now you two stay put.
Shilly-shallying around.

246
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,278
A husband's one piece of store goods
you never know

247
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,722
till you get it home and take the paper off.

248
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:08,642
Did Ben Harper ever tell you what
he done with the money he stole?

249
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,718
My dear child, don't you know?

250
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,598
She's mooning about Ben Harper.

251
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:19,199
That wasn't love. That was just
flapdoodle. Have some fudge, lambs.

252
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:21,005
When you've been married
to a man 40 years,

253
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:23,840
you know all that
don't amount to a hill of beans.

254
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:27,636
I've been married to my Walt that long
and I swear, in all that time,

255
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:30,400
I just lie there thinking about my canning.

256
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:35,638
John!

257
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:49,923
A woman's a fool to marry for that.
That's something for a man.

258
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:54,717
The good Lord never meant for a decent
woman to want that. Not really want it.

259
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,197
It's all just a fake and a pipe dream.

260
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:02,365
John, Mr Powell has something to tell you.

261
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,923
Well, John.

262
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:11,398
The night before your father died he
told me what he did with that money.

263
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:18,001
That money's at the bottom of the river,
wrapped around a 12-pound cobblestone.

264
00:23:19,727 --> 00:23:21,718
Thank you, Harry.

265
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:24,965
I feel clean now.

266
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:28,164
My whole body's just a-quivering
with cleanness.

267
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,956
John, come here. Your tie is crooked.

268
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:10,403
- When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
- Can't hear you, boy.

269
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,044
When'll the skiff be ready?

270
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,962
Have her ready inside a week
and then we'll go fishing.

271
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:27,437
- How's your ma?
- Oh, she's all right.

272
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:29,483
- How's sister Pearl?
- Just fine.

273
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,479
- You leaving, boy?
- Got to watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

274
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:35,240
Well, good night, boy.
Come again any time.

275
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:40,366
And mind, boy, I'll have your
pa's skiff shipshape inside a week.

276
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,558
Somebody there?

277
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:22,158
Anybody there?

278
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,118
Anybody here?

279
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:29,198
Good evening, John.

280
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:34,000
I had a little talk with
your mother tonight, John.

281
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:38,399
<i>And your mother decided it might be best
for me to let you know the news.</i>

282
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:43,719
Your mother told me she wanted me to
be a daddy to you and your sister.

283
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:45,798
We're going to get married, boy.

284
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:49,558
Did you hear what I said, boy?

285
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:53,639
Married. We're going to
Sisterville tomorrow.

286
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:57,241
- And when we get back...
- You ain't my dad.

287
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:59,165
You'll never be my dad.

288
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:02,284
When we get back
we're all going to be friends

289
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:05,397
and share our fortunes together, John.

290
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:08,604
You think you can make me tell,
but I won't. I won't!

291
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:14,719
- Tell me what, boy?
- Nothing.

292
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,275
We're not keeping secrets
from each other, are we?

293
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:20,758
No.

294
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,238
Well, no matter.

295
00:26:24,607 --> 00:26:26,837
We've got a long time together, boy.

296
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:36,036
Wave your hands! Great sakes!

297
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:39,719
Now you wait here
while I get your night things.

298
00:26:44,527 --> 00:26:46,518
Now can I tell?

299
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:50,199
When Mr Powell's our daddy
then can I tell him about it?

300
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:52,084
- You swore, Pearl.
- John, don't.

301
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,476
You promised Dad you wouldn't tell.

302
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,797
I love Mr Powell lots and lots, John.

303
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:29,318
Men!

304
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:43,238
Harry?

305
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,158
Fix that window shade.

306
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,798
I was praying.

307
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:04,885
I'm sorry. I didn't know. I thought...

308
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:07,561
You thought, Willa,
that the moment you walked in that door

309
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:10,684
I'd start to pawing you
in that abominable way

310
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,884
that men are supposed to do
on their wedding night.

311
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,038
- Ain't that right, now?
- No.

312
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:20,365
I think it's time we made one thing
perfectly clear, Willa.

313
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:25,077
Marriage to me represents a blending of
two spirits in the sight of heaven.

314
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:38,318
Get up, Willa.

315
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:42,198
- Harry, what...
- Get up.

316
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:48,439
Now, go look at yourself yonder
in that mirror.

317
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:52,198
Do as I say.

318
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:06,398
Look at yourself.

319
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:10,478
What do you see, girl?

320
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:13,118
You see the body of a woman.

321
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:15,761
The temple of creation and motherhood.

322
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:19,682
You see the flesh of Eve
that man since Adam has profaned.

323
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:22,237
That body was meant
for begetting children.

324
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,477
It was not meant for the lust of men.

325
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:29,043
Do you want more children, Willa?

326
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:30,765
I...

327
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:32,246
No.

328
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:35,478
It's the business of this marriage
to mind those two you have now,

329
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,523
not to beget more.

330
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:39,598
Yes.

331
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:49,444
All right. You can get in bed now
and stop shivering.

332
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:56,603
Help me to get clean, so I can be
what Harry wants me to be.

333
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:08,638
Meanest, orneriest, sneakiest critter
in the whole river, boy. A gar.

334
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:12,839
- Here are your hooks, Uncle Birdie.
- Pshaw, boy!

335
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,680
Ain't a hook in the land
strong enough to land Mr Gar.

336
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:19,803
What a fella needs is mother wit -
and a horse hair.

337
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:22,797
Golly! Won't it bust it, Uncle Birdie?

338
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,321
No, horse hair'll hold a lumpin' whale!

339
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,158
- You mind my cussin', boy?
- No.

340
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:33,044
Well, the reason I ask,
your step-pa bein' a preacher an' all...

341
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,559
Never was much of a one
for preachers my own self.

342
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:41,443
I don't know what's wrong
up at your house,

343
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:44,803
but always remember, Cap,
if you're ever in trouble,

344
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:48,722
holler and come a-runnin'.
Uncle Birdie's your friend.

345
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:58,877
There! You slimy, snag-toothed,
bait-stealin' so-and-so!

346
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:01,638
Amen.

347
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,718
- You have all sinned.
- Yes!

348
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:07,518
But which one of you can say,
as I can say,

349
00:31:08,447 --> 00:31:10,597
that you drove a good man to murder?

350
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:16,485
Because I kept a-houndin' him for
perfume and clothes and face paint!

351
00:31:17,247 --> 00:31:20,683
And... he slew two human beings!

352
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:23,795
And he come to me and he said

353
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:28,403
"Take this money and buy yourself
the clothes and the paint".

354
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,758
But brethren...

355
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:35,036
Oh, that's where the Lord stepped in!

356
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,756
Yes!

357
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:40,644
Alleluia!

358
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:43,242
He said, the Lord, to that man

359
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:48,523
"You take that money
and you throw it in the river!"

360
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:51,958
- In the river!
- In the river!

361
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:16,641
Now, you're John and you're Pearl.

362
00:32:18,887 --> 00:32:22,323
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a sin.

363
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,998
I didn't tell no one.

364
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:32,196
It's all here.

365
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:51,117
- John?
- Yes?

366
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:54,040
- What are you doin', boy?
- Gettin' Pearl to bed.

367
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:57,039
- What's takin' you so long about it?
- Nothing.

368
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,803
What's that you're playin' with?

369
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:06,206
Pearl's junk.

370
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:09,359
Mom gets mad when she plays out here
and don't put it away.

371
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:11,438
Come on, children.

372
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:16,678
Off to bed with the both of you.

373
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:25,038
Come here, John.

374
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:30,276
Your mother tells me you tattled on me.

375
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,763
She said you told her
I asked where that money was hid.

376
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,245
That wasn't very nice, boy. Have a heart.

377
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:41,118
Yeah!

378
00:33:41,447 --> 00:33:44,803
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's your word against mine.

379
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,044
It's me your mother believes.

380
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:55,040
Were you impudent again
to Mr Powell, John?

381
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:57,158
Mom, I didn't mean it.

382
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:00,438
What were you impudent about?

383
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,396
He asked me about
the money again, Mom.

384
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,197
John, you always make up that lie.

385
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:10,276
There is no money. Why can't you
get that through your head?

386
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,961
The boy's as stubborn
and as mulish as a sheep.

387
00:34:14,047 --> 00:34:15,400
It's a shame.

388
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,205
- Good night, Icey.
- Good night, honey.

389
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:19,517
Good night, Walt.

390
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:23,598
Plan on a longer visit next time.

391
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:26,561
You hardly settle before
you're frettin' to get home.

392
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,207
I'm needed to keep peace
and harmony betwixt them.

393
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:31,721
It's my burden and I'm proud of it, Icey.

394
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:44,957
- Where's the money hid?
- I don't know.

395
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:47,959
She thinks that money's
at the bottom of the river.

396
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,242
But you and me,
we know better, don't we?

397
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:52,318
I don't know nothin'.

398
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:55,759
Well, never mind, boy.
The summer's young yet.

399
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:59,239
Pearl. Come here.

400
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:05,565
<i>John's a fella likes to keep secrets.
I'll tell you a secret.</i>

401
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:08,639
- Yes?
- I knowed your daddy.

402
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:12,277
And you know what your daddy told me?

403
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:17,198
He said "You tell my little girl Pearl there's
to be no secrets between her and you".

404
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:19,005
Yes?

405
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:21,078
All right. Now it's your turn.

406
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,478
What secret shall I tell?

407
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:26,718
What's your name?

408
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:29,196
You're just fooling. My name's Pearl!

409
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:33,836
Well, I reckon I'll have to try again.

410
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:36,518
Where's the money hid?

411
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:41,279
Pearl! You swore you wouldn't tell!
You swore!

412
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,877
You hit Daddy with the hairbrush.

413
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:49,724
Now, you see?
We can't have anything to do with John.

414
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:52,760
You and me'll go on down
to the parlour, Pearl.

415
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:12,285
John's just plumb bad
through and through.

416
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:15,359
- John's bad.
- Yes, John's bad.

417
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:20,559
- Tell me another secret about my dad.
- Oh, no! Your turn.

418
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:22,877
All right. What secret shall I tell?

419
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,116
- Where's the money hid?
- John's bad.

420
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:29,638
Where's the money hid?

421
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:32,919
Tell me, you little wretch,
or I'll tear your arm off!

422
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:48,004
- Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
- How do you mean?

423
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:50,881
I'm figurin' how to say it
so as you won't get mad.

424
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,923
Say what, Walt Spoon?

425
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:55,202
- Somethin's wrong about it.
- About what?

426
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:57,676
- About Mr Powell. All of it.
- Walt...!

427
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:03,157
- A body's got a right to their feelings.
- May the Lord have mercy on you.

428
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,602
I was just...

429
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:10,558
Amen.

430
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:13,718
Are you through praying?

431
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:16,078
I'm through, Harry.

432
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:18,641
You were listening
outside the parlour window.

433
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:21,719
- It ain't in the river, is it, Harry?
- Answer me.

434
00:37:22,247 --> 00:37:25,444
Ben never told you he throwed it
in the river, did he?

435
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:39,844
The children know where it's hid.
John knows. Is that it, Harry?

436
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:49,603
Then it's still here amongst us.
Tainting us.

437
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:55,840
You must have known about it
all along, Harry.

438
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:59,120
But that ain't the reason
why you married me.

439
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:01,838
I know that much.

440
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,761
Because the Lord just wouldn't let it be.

441
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:12,639
He made you marry me so you could
show me the Way and the Life.

442
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:16,238
And the salvation of my soul.

443
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:20,398
Ain't that so, Harry?

444
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:24,044
So you might say that it was the money
that brung us together.

445
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:28,198
The rest of it don't matter.

446
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,438
Walt. Come quick.

447
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:27,643
- What's wrong, Mother?
- Shhh! He's in there.

448
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:31,561
- Who?
- Mr Powell. Willa has run away.

449
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:35,846
- I'll be switched! Just went?
- She took out in that old Model T.

450
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:38,517
- Is he hit pretty bad?
- All to pieces.

451
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:40,677
Well, there's a little
peach brandy in here...

452
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:43,679
- A man of the cloth?
- Well, just a sip.

453
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:47,400
Walt Spoon, that's for sickness
in the house!

454
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,638
- Well, what can we do?
- If you talked to him, another man...

455
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:54,525
Now, Mother, please. I'm no good at...

456
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:58,516
Mr Powell?

457
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:01,167
- A strange woman is a narrow pit.
- Amen.

458
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:05,798
She lieth in wait as for prey and
increaseth the transgressors among men.

459
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,206
Oh, my dear friends.
Whatever would I do without you?

460
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:12,518
- Mr Powell!
- Well, if there's anythin' we can...

461
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:15,963
No, it's my shame. It's my crown
of thorns. I must wear it bravely.

462
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,959
- What could have possessed that girl?
- Satan.

463
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:21,644
Didn't you have no inklin'?

464
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:24,036
Yes, I did. From the very first night.

465
00:40:24,487 --> 00:40:26,478
- First night?
- Our honeymoon.

466
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:29,238
How's that?

467
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:32,479
- She turned me out of the bed.
- No!

468
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:35,959
Well, what do you figure to do?

469
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:39,483
Do? Why, just stay right here
and take care of them kids.

470
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:44,678
Maybe it was never meant for a woman
like Willa to taint their young lives.

471
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:46,565
It's mighty brave of you.

472
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:50,003
I reckon it was just ordained that way,
Brother Spoon.

473
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:52,757
Didn't she leave no word?

474
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:56,799
A scrawl. On a notepaper on the bureau.

475
00:40:57,567 --> 00:40:59,558
I burned it.

476
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:02,924
Tore it up and burned it,
it stank so strong of hellfire.

477
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:04,804
Amen!

478
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:07,845
The pitcher has went to the well
once too often, friends.

479
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:10,521
Oh, she'll come
draggin' her tail back home.

480
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:14,236
She'll not be back.
I reckon I'm safe in promisin' you that.

481
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:16,483
- Maybe she's just on a spree.
- Oh, no.

482
00:41:16,927 --> 00:41:20,806
- Well, there's no harm in hopin'.
- Ain't no sense in it neither.

483
00:41:21,287 --> 00:41:24,085
I figured somethin' was brewin'
when she went to bed last night.

484
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:26,158
How?

485
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,520
Well, she tarried around
in the kitchen after I'd gone up.

486
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:32,724
And when I went downstairs
to see what was wrong...

487
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:36,395
Well, she'd found
this jar of dandelion wine

488
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:40,766
that the husband, this Harper,
had hid somewheres in the cellar.

489
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:43,318
She was drinkin'.

490
00:41:44,487 --> 00:41:45,966
I tried to save her.

491
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:49,642
I know you did, Mr Powell.
Oh, I know how hard you tried.

492
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:51,718
But the devil wins sometimes.

493
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:55,399
<i>Can't nobody say
I didn't do my best to save her.</i>

494
00:43:14,807 --> 00:43:16,365
Children!

495
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:33,438
Pearl?

496
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,798
Careful.

497
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:40,678
Why do we have to hide, John?

498
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:45,041
Where's Mom?

499
00:43:45,127 --> 00:43:47,482
- She's gone to Moundsville.
- To see Dad?

500
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:49,558
Yes, I reckon that's it.

501
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:59,839
Now, listen to me, Pearl.
You and me is runnin' off tonight.

502
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:01,645
Why?

503
00:44:01,727 --> 00:44:04,366
If we stay here
somethin' awful'll happen to us.

504
00:44:04,447 --> 00:44:06,597
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?

505
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,764
No. That's just it. No.

506
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:20,923
- Where we going, John?
- Somewheres. I don't know yet.

507
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:23,160
I'm hungry, John.

508
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:26,239
- We'll steal somethin' to eat.
- It'll spoil our suppers.

509
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:28,318
Pearl?

510
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:35,405
I can hear you whisperin', children,
so I know you're down there.

511
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:37,717
I can feel myself gettin' awful mad.

512
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:45,122
I'm out of patience, children.
I'm coming to find you now.

513
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:49,078
Mr Powell!

514
00:44:53,127 --> 00:44:55,118
Well, well, Mrs Spoon.

515
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:59,795
- Where are the children?
- Down there in that cellar playin' games.

516
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:01,878
And they won't mind me when I call them.

517
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:03,958
I'm at my wit's end, Mrs Spoon.

518
00:45:05,207 --> 00:45:07,198
John? Pearl?

519
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:15,718
Shake a leg!

520
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:23,960
Well, well, well! What's that?

521
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:27,244
Just a little hot supper
I fixed for you and the children.

522
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:29,716
It seemed the least we could do.

523
00:45:31,407 --> 00:45:33,796
I won't have you worryin'
poor Mr Powell another minute.

524
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:36,799
Just look at you!
Dust and filth from top to toe.

525
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:39,396
Want me to take 'em up
and wash 'em good?

526
00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:43,884
No. No, thank you, dear Icey.
I'll tend to them. Thank you.

527
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:48,046
Don't be too hard on them, Preacher.
Poor, motherless children.

528
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:51,643
Remember, now, Mr Powell.
Don't be afraid to call on us.

529
00:45:56,647 --> 00:45:58,365
Goodbye.

530
00:45:58,447 --> 00:46:00,836
Goodbye, Mrs Spoon. And thanks again.

531
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:13,125
Now, weren't you afraid, little lambs?
Down there in all that dark?

532
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:30,678
They'll think it was me.

533
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,840
They'll think it was poor old Uncle Birdie.

534
00:46:36,847 --> 00:46:38,997
Oh, if you could have seen it, Bess.

535
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:42,718
Down there in the deep place.

536
00:46:43,647 --> 00:46:49,404
With her hair wavin' soft and lazy
like meadow grass under flood water.

537
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:55,324
And that slit in her throat
like she had an extra mouth.

538
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:03,003
You're the only human mortal
I can go to, Bess.

539
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:08,405
If I go to the law, they'll hang it on me.

540
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:17,764
Sweet heaven, save poor old Uncle Birdie!

541
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:25,802
- I'm hungry.
- Sure.

542
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:30,998
And there's fried chicken, sweet
potatoes, corn bread and apple cobbler.

543
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:34,800
- Can I have my supper, please?
- Naturally.

544
00:47:35,007 --> 00:47:38,966
- Can I have milk too?
- Mm-hm. But first we'll have a little talk.

545
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:41,558
- About our secrets.
- No.

546
00:47:41,847 --> 00:47:44,407
- And why not, pray tell?
- Cos John said I mustn't.

547
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,478
Never mind what John said!

548
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,358
John's a meddler.

549
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:51,438
Now stop that snivellin'.

550
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:53,717
Looky here. You know what that is?

551
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:56,996
Want to see somethin' cute? Now looky.

552
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,158
How about that!

553
00:48:01,767 --> 00:48:03,758
This is what I use on meddlers.

554
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:06,518
John might be a meddler.

555
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,242
No, little lamb. Don't touch it.

556
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:13,283
Don't touch my knife.
That makes me mad. Very, very mad.

557
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:17,481
Now, just tell me. Where's the money hid?

558
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:20,076
But I swore.
I promised John I wouldn't tell.

559
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:22,158
John doesn't matter!

560
00:48:23,287 --> 00:48:28,202
Can't I get that through your head,
you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch?

561
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:35,396
There now. You made me lose my temper.

562
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:40,165
I'm sorry. I'm real sorry.

563
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:43,561
Now, just tell me. Where's it hid, honey?

564
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,475
<i>- I'll tell.
- I told you to keep your mouth shut.</i>

565
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:50,765
It ain't fair to make Pearl tell
when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.

566
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:52,326
Well, I declare!

567
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:56,036
Sometimes I think poor ol' John
might make it to heaven yet.

568
00:48:56,447 --> 00:49:01,282
- All right, boy. Where's the money?
- In the cellar. Under a stone in the floor.

569
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:06,039
- It'll go hard if I find you're lyin', boy.
- I'm not lyin'. Go look for yourself.

570
00:49:08,327 --> 00:49:10,318
All right.

571
00:49:19,847 --> 00:49:21,838
- Come along.
- What?

572
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:27,038
Go ahead of me. The both of you.

573
00:49:28,327 --> 00:49:30,318
Down those stairs.

574
00:49:34,382 --> 00:49:36,612
You don't reckon I'd leave you,
do you, boy?

575
00:49:36,702 --> 00:49:40,490
- Well, don't you believe me?
- Why, sure, boy. Sure.

576
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,252
And where now? Mind, no tricks, now.

577
00:49:46,502 --> 00:49:48,493
I can't abide a liar.

578
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:50,693
Yonder.

579
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:55,733
Oh, no, you don't.

580
00:50:00,182 --> 00:50:03,538
- Now where, boy, where?
- Under the stone in the floor.

581
00:50:12,822 --> 00:50:14,813
This is concrete.

582
00:50:15,062 --> 00:50:17,860
John made a sin. John told a lie.

583
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:22,533
The Lord's a-talking to me now.

584
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:28,210
He's a-saying "A liar
is an abomination before mine eyes".

585
00:50:29,822 --> 00:50:31,813
Speak, boy, where's it hid?

586
00:50:32,342 --> 00:50:34,253
Speak.

587
00:50:34,342 --> 00:50:38,779
Speak, or I'll cut your throat and leave you
to drip like a hog in butchering time.

588
00:50:38,862 --> 00:50:41,740
Pearl, shut up. Pearl, you swore!

589
00:50:43,142 --> 00:50:44,860
You could save him, little bird.

590
00:50:45,262 --> 00:50:47,253
It's in my doll!

591
00:50:50,702 --> 00:50:52,693
The doll!

592
00:50:55,462 --> 00:50:57,453
Why, sure!

593
00:50:57,982 --> 00:51:00,416
The last place anybody'd think to look.

594
00:51:26,262 --> 00:51:28,651
Uncle Birdie Steptoe.

595
00:51:28,942 --> 00:51:32,901
Open that door, you spawn
of the devil's own strumpet!

596
00:51:59,462 --> 00:52:01,453
Uncle Birdie!

597
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:05,814
- Uncle Birdie.
- John.

598
00:52:06,182 --> 00:52:09,458
Hide us, Uncle Birdie.
He's a-coming with his knife.

599
00:52:11,822 --> 00:52:14,894
It's me. John Harper and Pearl.
You told me to come.

600
00:52:14,982 --> 00:52:17,098
- Johnny?
- Uncle Birdie, oh, please.

601
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:18,979
Please! Wake up!

602
00:52:19,062 --> 00:52:22,099
I swear on the Book, I never done it.

603
00:52:37,302 --> 00:52:39,293
There's still the river.

604
00:52:47,142 --> 00:52:49,053
The skiff is under the willow.

605
00:53:07,222 --> 00:53:09,213
Children!

606
00:55:49,742 --> 00:55:51,334
"Dear Walt and Icey,

607
00:55:51,422 --> 00:55:54,459
I bet you've been worried
and gave us up for lost".

608
00:55:54,982 --> 00:55:59,294
"Took the kids down here with me
for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm".

609
00:56:00,342 --> 00:56:03,254
"Thought a little change of scenery
would do us all a world of good

610
00:56:03,342 --> 00:56:05,731
after so much trouble and heartache".

611
00:56:06,462 --> 00:56:10,091
"At least the kids will get
a-plenty of good home cooking".

612
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:12,014
"Your devoted Harry Powell".

613
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,093
Now, ain't you relieved, Walt?

614
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:19,330
Sure. But you was worried too, Mother.
Taking off with never a word of goodbye!

615
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:22,619
I figured them gypsies busted in
and done off with all three of them.

616
00:56:22,702 --> 00:56:25,136
You and your gypsies.
They been gone a week.

617
00:56:25,222 --> 00:56:29,135
Sure. But not before one of 'em
knifed a farmer and stole his horse.

618
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:31,531
Never caught the gypsy. Nor the horse.

619
00:56:47,262 --> 00:56:50,493
Such times,
when young 'uns run the roads.

620
00:56:50,582 --> 00:56:52,573
Go away, children.

621
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,620
Hungry, I suppose?

622
00:57:00,702 --> 00:57:03,899
Well, I can't spare you more
than one potato apiece.

623
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:06,976
<i>- Where are your folks?
- Ain't got none.</i>

624
00:57:07,102 --> 00:57:09,093
Oh, go away, go away.

625
00:57:18,142 --> 00:57:21,373
An ungrateful child is an
abomination before the eyes of God.

626
00:57:21,462 --> 00:57:26,297
The world is going to damnation because
of young 'uns flying in the face of age.

627
00:57:40,022 --> 00:57:41,580
They make soup out of them,

628
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:44,859
but I wouldn't know
how to go about getting him open.

629
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,771
We're going to spend the night on land.

630
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:48,251
Are we going home now, John?

631
01:01:54,022 --> 01:01:56,411
Don't he never sleep?

632
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:04,173
Pearl, wake up. Come on!

633
01:04:41,142 --> 01:04:44,179
You two youngsters
get up here to me this instant.

634
01:04:44,702 --> 01:04:48,854
Get on up to my house.
Mind me, now. I'll get me a switch.

635
01:05:03,382 --> 01:05:06,692
- Don't you hurt her.
- Hurt her? Wash her's more like it!

636
01:05:07,582 --> 01:05:11,416
- Ruby! Clary! Mary!
- Yes, Miss Cooper.

637
01:05:12,582 --> 01:05:14,573
Bring your baskets.

638
01:05:18,622 --> 01:05:20,260
Nicely picked, Clary.

639
01:05:20,702 --> 01:05:22,693
Mary, put the big ones on top.

640
01:05:22,942 --> 01:05:25,217
Ruby, most of them
ain't fit to go to market.

641
01:05:25,302 --> 01:05:26,735
Put them down.

642
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:30,531
Ruby, run to the house and fetch
the tub and put it by the pump.

643
01:05:30,782 --> 01:05:33,819
Clary... Mary,
run up and fetch a bar of laundry soap.

644
01:05:33,902 --> 01:05:35,221
Yes, Miss Cooper.

645
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:38,499
And a scrub brush!
Come on up to the house, children.

646
01:05:40,702 --> 01:05:43,296
Gracious, if you ain't a sight to beat all!

647
01:05:43,662 --> 01:05:45,653
Where you from?

648
01:05:46,662 --> 01:05:48,459
Where are your folks?

649
01:05:48,542 --> 01:05:50,533
Come on, speak up, now.

650
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:55,295
Gracious,
so I've got two more mouths to feed.

651
01:06:21,502 --> 01:06:23,652
Howdy, Miss Cooper.
What happened to my milk?

652
01:06:23,742 --> 01:06:25,221
Price of milk what it is, not on your life.

653
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:27,931
Do better making butter
with the cream. Sell it retail.

654
01:06:28,022 --> 01:06:31,537
Make smearcase for the children,
feed what's left to my hogs.

655
01:06:31,622 --> 01:06:33,738
- She talks to herself.
- All the time.

656
01:06:33,822 --> 01:06:37,417
- Your ma's funny.
- She ain't our ma. We just live with her.

657
01:06:37,862 --> 01:06:39,932
- Where are your folks?
- Someplace.

658
01:06:40,022 --> 01:06:41,819
My daddy's in Detroit.

659
01:06:43,382 --> 01:06:45,373
Mary!

660
01:06:46,742 --> 01:06:48,573
Honey. Good morning, Miss Cooper.

661
01:06:48,662 --> 01:06:50,812
I'm saving up to buy you a bracelet.

662
01:06:50,942 --> 01:06:55,936
Never mind that, don't forget your visit
this Sunday - and come to church with us.

663
01:06:56,982 --> 01:06:58,973
See you Sunday, love.

664
01:06:59,742 --> 01:07:01,733
Take your baskets in, children.

665
01:07:02,222 --> 01:07:04,099
Women is fools.

666
01:07:04,182 --> 01:07:06,173
All of 'em.

667
01:07:07,462 --> 01:07:09,373
Looky there.

668
01:07:09,462 --> 01:07:11,896
She'll be losing her mind
to a tricky mouth and a full moon,

669
01:07:11,982 --> 01:07:15,816
and like as not, I'll be saddled
with the consequences.

670
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:18,533
Here's what you owe me.

671
01:07:19,742 --> 01:07:21,733
One, two, three, four, five...

672
01:07:21,942 --> 01:07:23,978
Where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?

673
01:07:24,062 --> 01:07:25,461
She went.

674
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,533
John, you go find Ruby.

675
01:07:27,742 --> 01:07:31,212
Big Ruby's my bothersome girl.
She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em.

676
01:07:31,302 --> 01:07:35,534
But she's got mother hands with the
young 'uns, so what are you to say?

677
01:07:36,222 --> 01:07:38,053
How about tonight, Ruby?

678
01:07:38,142 --> 01:07:40,451
- What gives?
- The old lady's around.

679
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:43,613
How about Thursday?

680
01:07:44,862 --> 01:07:48,252
The old gal thinks she comes in
for sewing lessons on Thursday.

681
01:07:48,342 --> 01:07:50,333
Miss Cooper wants you.

682
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:56,255
And will you show me your dolly,
little lady?

683
01:07:57,462 --> 01:07:59,373
I see you got two more peeps
to your brood.

684
01:07:59,462 --> 01:08:02,852
- Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
- How's your own boy, Miss Cooper?

685
01:08:02,942 --> 01:08:07,572
Haven't heard from Ralph since last
Christmas. Still, I've got a new crop.

686
01:08:08,582 --> 01:08:11,494
I'm a strong tree
with branches for many birds.

687
01:08:11,822 --> 01:08:15,417
I'm good for something in this old world,
and I know it too.

688
01:08:37,222 --> 01:08:41,261
Now, old Pharaoh,
he was king of Egypt land,

689
01:08:41,902 --> 01:08:43,620
and he had a daughter.

690
01:08:44,182 --> 01:08:46,173
And once upon a time,

691
01:08:47,942 --> 01:08:49,694
she was walking along by the river bank

692
01:08:49,782 --> 01:08:53,297
and she seen something bumping
and scraping along on a sand bar

693
01:08:53,382 --> 01:08:57,011
down under the willows.
And you know what it was, children?

694
01:08:57,182 --> 01:08:58,258
No.

695
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:00,981
Now, it was a skiff, washed up on the bar.

696
01:09:02,262 --> 01:09:04,014
And who do you reckon was in it?

697
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:06,093
Pearl and John.

698
01:09:06,502 --> 01:09:11,292
Not this time. There was only
one young 'un, a little boy babe.

699
01:09:11,702 --> 01:09:14,535
- And you know who he was, children?
- No.

700
01:09:16,382 --> 01:09:19,294
It was Moses. A king of men.

701
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:21,893
Moses, children.

702
01:09:22,382 --> 01:09:24,373
Now, off to bed with you.

703
01:09:24,742 --> 01:09:27,336
John, get me an apple.

704
01:09:42,982 --> 01:09:44,973
And get one for yourself too.

705
01:09:57,702 --> 01:09:59,693
John, where are your folks?

706
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:02,053
Dead.

707
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,773
Where are you from?

708
01:10:06,022 --> 01:10:08,013
Upriver.

709
01:10:09,062 --> 01:10:13,453
I didn't figure you'd rowed that skiff
all the way up from Parkersburg.

710
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:28,533
Tell me that story again.

711
01:10:28,982 --> 01:10:30,973
Story? What story, honey?

712
01:10:32,182 --> 01:10:33,615
About them kings.

713
01:10:33,702 --> 01:10:37,411
And the queen found down on
the sand bar that time in the skiff.

714
01:10:37,502 --> 01:10:40,574
Kings?
Why, there was only one king, honey.

715
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:43,813
I mind you said there was two.

716
01:10:45,022 --> 01:10:47,582
Well, shoot now. Maybe there was.

717
01:10:48,982 --> 01:10:51,371
Yes, come to think of it, there was two.

718
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:19,052
Must be Thursday. Here comes Ruby.

719
01:11:26,422 --> 01:11:28,413
Here I go.

720
01:11:34,342 --> 01:11:36,617
Why, you're Ruby, ain't you, my child?

721
01:11:36,702 --> 01:11:37,896
Can I have this?

722
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:40,416
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.

723
01:11:40,582 --> 01:11:42,254
- Will you buy me an ice cream?
- Of course.

724
01:11:42,342 --> 01:11:44,617
- Watch out, Preacher.
- Why, Preacher!

725
01:11:44,702 --> 01:11:46,693
Shut your dirty mouths.

726
01:11:57,542 --> 01:11:58,895
Ain't I pretty?

727
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:02,861
Why, you're the prettiest thing
I ever seen in all my wandering.

728
01:12:02,942 --> 01:12:05,376
Ain't nobody never told you that, Ruby?

729
01:12:05,782 --> 01:12:08,057
No, no one never did.

730
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:10,781
There's two new ones out your place,
ain't there?

731
01:12:10,862 --> 01:12:12,853
Uh-huh.

732
01:12:13,142 --> 01:12:15,531
- What's their names?
- Pearl and John.

733
01:12:17,422 --> 01:12:20,778
- Is there a doll?
- Only they don't never let me play with it.

734
01:12:28,342 --> 01:12:31,573
Did you ever see such pretty eyes
in all your born days?

735
01:12:31,662 --> 01:12:33,380
Don't let him get away, sugar.

736
01:12:33,462 --> 01:12:38,013
He ain't like you all. Next time, I won't
even ask him to buy me an ice cream.

737
01:12:46,022 --> 01:12:48,013
I's bitten bad.

738
01:12:51,622 --> 01:12:54,739
- Ruby, you didn't have money to buy this.
- You'll whip me.

739
01:12:54,822 --> 01:12:56,380
When did I ever?

740
01:12:56,462 --> 01:12:59,898
- This man at the drugstore, he gave...
- The drugstore?

741
01:13:00,782 --> 01:13:04,297
Miss Cooper, I never been
to sewing lessons all them times.

742
01:13:04,382 --> 01:13:06,373
What you been up to, Ruby?

743
01:13:06,862 --> 01:13:08,853
I been out with men.

744
01:13:10,382 --> 01:13:12,373
Child.

745
01:13:16,342 --> 01:13:20,574
You were looking for love, Ruby,
in the only foolish way you knew how.

746
01:13:24,502 --> 01:13:26,493
We all need love, Ruby.

747
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:29,093
I lost the love of my son.

748
01:13:29,502 --> 01:13:31,493
I found it with you all.

749
01:13:33,302 --> 01:13:36,339
You're going to grow up to be a strong,
fine woman.

750
01:13:36,502 --> 01:13:40,336
- I'm going to see to it that you do.
- This gentleman weren't like them.

751
01:13:40,422 --> 01:13:43,095
He just give me a book
and buy me an ice cream.

752
01:13:43,222 --> 01:13:46,259
- Now, who was this?
- He didn't ask me for nothing.

753
01:13:46,502 --> 01:13:49,096
- What did you talk about?
- Pearl and John.

754
01:13:50,062 --> 01:13:52,815
John and Pearl? Is he their pap?

755
01:13:53,102 --> 01:13:55,093
I don't know.

756
01:13:55,822 --> 01:13:57,938
Wonder why he hasn't been to the house.

757
01:14:15,862 --> 01:14:17,853
Miss Cooper!

758
01:14:18,102 --> 01:14:20,662
- What?
- The man!

759
01:14:25,022 --> 01:14:26,660
Good morning, ladies.

760
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:29,973
- How do?
- Why, you're Miss Cooper, I take it?

761
01:14:30,662 --> 01:14:32,732
It's about that John and that Pearl?

762
01:14:32,822 --> 01:14:34,813
Oh, them poor little lambs.

763
01:14:34,982 --> 01:14:37,337
To think I never hoped
to see them again in this world.

764
01:14:37,422 --> 01:14:41,654
Oh, dear madam, if you was to know
what a crown of thorns I've borne

765
01:14:41,742 --> 01:14:43,892
in my search for them stray chicks.

766
01:14:44,862 --> 01:14:46,853
Ruby, go fetch them kids.

767
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:52,535
Oh, madam,
I see you're looking at my hands.

768
01:14:53,262 --> 01:14:57,141
Shall I tell you the story of Left-hand,
Right-hand, the tale of good and evil?

769
01:14:57,222 --> 01:15:01,056
It was with this left hand that Cain struck
the blow that laid his brother low.

770
01:15:01,142 --> 01:15:04,896
- Them kids is yours?
- My own flesh and blood.

771
01:15:05,262 --> 01:15:09,141
- Where's your missus?
- She run off with a drummer.

772
01:15:09,822 --> 01:15:12,256
- During prayer meeting.
- Where's she at?

773
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:14,810
Down the river somewheres.
Parkersburg, Cincinnati.

774
01:15:14,902 --> 01:15:18,372
- One of them Sodoms of the Ohio river.
- She took them kids with her?

775
01:15:18,462 --> 01:15:21,374
Oh, heaven only knows
what unholy sights and sounds

776
01:15:21,462 --> 01:15:25,819
them innocent babes has heard in the
dens of perdition where she dragged 'em.

777
01:15:25,902 --> 01:15:30,532
Right funny, ain't it, how they rode
all the way upriver in a ten-foot john boat.

778
01:15:32,062 --> 01:15:35,577
- Are they well, Miss Cooper?
- A sight better than they was.

779
01:15:37,022 --> 01:15:40,458
Gracious, gracious,
you are a good woman, Miss Cooper.

780
01:15:40,742 --> 01:15:43,210
How you figuring to raise them two
without a woman?

781
01:15:43,302 --> 01:15:46,578
The Lord will provide.
The Lord is merciful.

782
01:15:47,262 --> 01:15:49,457
Oh, what a day this is.

783
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:51,533
And there's little John.

784
01:15:51,742 --> 01:15:54,131
- What's wrong, John?
- Come to me, boy.

785
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:57,095
- What's wrong, John?
- Didn't you hear me, boy?

786
01:15:57,182 --> 01:15:59,457
When your dad says "come"
you should mind him.

787
01:15:59,542 --> 01:16:01,339
He ain't my dad.

788
01:16:04,582 --> 01:16:06,971
No, and he ain't no preacher neither.

789
01:16:14,902 --> 01:16:18,019
Just march yourself yonder
to your horse, mister.

790
01:16:21,062 --> 01:16:23,053
March, mister. I'm not foolin'!

791
01:16:26,102 --> 01:16:29,890
All right. But you haven't
heard the last of Harry Powell yet!

792
01:16:30,942 --> 01:16:34,218
The Lord God Jehovah
will guide my hand in vengeance.

793
01:16:35,782 --> 01:16:37,773
You devils!

794
01:16:39,102 --> 01:16:41,900
You whores of Babylon!

795
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,693
I'll be back! When it's dark!

796
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:23,933
Shame on you, Ruby, mooning around
the house after that mad dog of a man.

797
01:18:25,822 --> 01:18:27,414
Merciful heavens!

798
01:18:28,382 --> 01:18:32,091
Ruby, go get the children out of bed
and bring them down here.

799
01:18:34,022 --> 01:18:36,013
Women are such darn fools.

800
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:56,772
It's a hard world for little things.

801
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:21,376
Now, there was this sneaking,
no-account, ornery King Herod,

802
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:23,578
and when he heard of
little Jesus growin' up,

803
01:19:23,662 --> 01:19:27,337
he figured "Well, shoot, there
won't be room for the both of us".

804
01:19:27,702 --> 01:19:29,021
"I'll nip this in the bud".

805
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:32,617
But he wasn't sure which of all them
babies in the land was King Jesus.

806
01:19:32,702 --> 01:19:35,011
So that cruel old King Herod figured,

807
01:19:35,102 --> 01:19:38,697
if he was to kill all the babies in the land
he'd be sure and get little Jesus.

808
01:19:39,262 --> 01:19:41,651
When little King Jesus'
ma and pa heard about this,

809
01:19:41,742 --> 01:19:43,221
what do you reckon they done?

810
01:19:43,302 --> 01:19:45,816
- They hid in a closet.
- They hid under the porch.

811
01:19:45,902 --> 01:19:47,893
No. They went a-running.

812
01:19:48,422 --> 01:19:52,051
Well, now, John, you're right.
That's just what they done.

813
01:19:52,262 --> 01:19:54,571
Little King Jesus' ma and pa
saddled a mule

814
01:19:54,662 --> 01:19:57,017
and they rode all the way down
into Egypt land.

815
01:19:57,102 --> 01:20:00,333
Yeah, and that's where the queen
found them in the bulrushes.

816
01:20:00,422 --> 01:20:03,380
Oh, no, that wasn't the same story.
That was little King Moses.

817
01:20:03,462 --> 01:20:07,171
But just the same, it did seem like
it was a plague time for little ones.

818
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:09,696
Them olden days. Them hard, hard times.

819
01:20:16,902 --> 01:20:18,654
Figured I was gone, huh?

820
01:20:18,742 --> 01:20:21,336
Run. Hide on the staircase. Run quick!

821
01:20:21,702 --> 01:20:23,693
Ruby, get!

822
01:20:24,102 --> 01:20:26,332
- What do you want?
- I want them kids.

823
01:20:26,982 --> 01:20:28,654
What do you want them for?

824
01:20:28,742 --> 01:20:31,575
- None of your business, madam.
- I'm giving you to the count of three to go.

825
01:20:31,662 --> 01:20:34,654
Then I'm coming across
to the kitchen to shoot you!

826
01:20:48,342 --> 01:20:50,333
Miss Booth? Rachel Cooper.

827
01:20:50,502 --> 01:20:52,493
Get your state troopers out to my place.

828
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:54,732
I got something trapped in my barn.

829
01:21:05,142 --> 01:21:07,656
- I'll go see to Pearl.
- I'll make coffee.

830
01:21:17,502 --> 01:21:19,493
She's all right.

831
01:21:21,422 --> 01:21:23,538
John, you know when you're little
you have more endurance

832
01:21:23,622 --> 01:21:25,772
than God is ever to grant you again?

833
01:21:26,342 --> 01:21:29,254
Children are man at his strongest.
They abide.

834
01:21:43,142 --> 01:21:46,976
- Why didn't you call us before now?
- Didn't want your dirty shoes on my floor.

835
01:21:47,062 --> 01:21:48,177
Is that him?

836
01:21:48,262 --> 01:21:51,095
Yes. Mind where you shoot, boys.
There are children here.

837
01:21:51,182 --> 01:21:55,300
Harry Powell, you're under arrest
for the murder of Willa Harper.

838
01:21:56,742 --> 01:21:58,733
Drop that knife, Powell.

839
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:01,217
Don't.

840
01:22:07,142 --> 01:22:08,621
Here!

841
01:22:08,702 --> 01:22:10,772
Take it back, Dad. Take it back!

842
01:22:10,862 --> 01:22:13,934
I don't want it, Dad! It's too much! Here!

843
01:22:24,902 --> 01:22:26,893
Lynch him!

844
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,294
Bluebeard!

845
01:22:29,382 --> 01:22:32,260
- 25 wives!
- And he killed every last one of 'em.

846
01:22:32,342 --> 01:22:35,459
- If the people of Marshall County...
- Bluebeard!

847
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:43,573
Will you identify the prisoner?

848
01:22:44,222 --> 01:22:45,621
Please, little lad,

849
01:22:45,702 --> 01:22:50,696
won't you look yonder and tell the court
if that is the man that killed your mother?

850
01:22:57,662 --> 01:23:01,052
It's all right, Mrs Cooper,
you can take the little fellow away.

851
01:23:01,262 --> 01:23:03,412
Merry Christmas to you and yours,
Mrs Cooper.

852
01:23:03,502 --> 01:23:07,734
And what's Santa Claus going to
bring you for Christmas, little man?

853
01:23:17,822 --> 01:23:19,813
- That's Pearl!
- Get your coats.

854
01:23:20,622 --> 01:23:22,578
Them's her orphans.

855
01:23:22,662 --> 01:23:24,334
- Where's Ruby?
- She went.

856
01:23:24,422 --> 01:23:27,141
Them poor little lambs.

857
01:23:27,222 --> 01:23:31,010
Them is the ones he sinned against,
my friends.

858
01:23:31,462 --> 01:23:33,453
Go out the back door.

859
01:23:36,942 --> 01:23:39,172
Ain't we going to the bus depot?

860
01:23:40,742 --> 01:23:44,132
Dragging the name of the Lord
through the evil mud of his soul!

861
01:23:44,222 --> 01:23:48,773
- String that Bluebeard up to a post!
- He's Satan hiding behind the cross!

862
01:24:33,262 --> 01:24:36,732
I love him. You think he's like them others.

863
01:24:42,502 --> 01:24:44,493
You were so mad, you shot him.

864
01:24:59,902 --> 01:25:01,301
- Hey, Bart.
- Yeah?

865
01:25:01,382 --> 01:25:05,170
- We're saving this bird up for you.
- This time it'll be a privilege.

866
01:25:30,062 --> 01:25:32,576
I'm glad they sent me nothing.
It's never nothing I want.

867
01:25:32,662 --> 01:25:37,292
Just something to show me how fancy
and smart they've come up in the world.

868
01:25:42,782 --> 01:25:44,613
Can we give you your presents now?

869
01:25:44,702 --> 01:25:49,253
Shoot, you don't mean to say
you got me a present? Shoot, now.

870
01:25:55,662 --> 01:25:56,890
Ruby.

871
01:25:57,582 --> 01:25:59,573
A pot-holder!

872
01:25:59,662 --> 01:26:02,256
And it's much neater than last year, Ruby.

873
01:26:03,182 --> 01:26:04,581
Clary.

874
01:26:05,942 --> 01:26:10,891
Another pot-holder! Ain't that thoughtful.
I'm always burning my hands.

875
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:16,175
This doesn't look basted.
This looks made!

876
01:26:17,102 --> 01:26:19,491
And you finished the edge
with a chain-stitch.

877
01:26:19,582 --> 01:26:21,573
Oh, that's just dandy, Clary.

878
01:26:24,422 --> 01:26:26,413
Another pot-holder?

879
01:26:31,462 --> 01:26:34,022
Oh, now, did you two make this together?

880
01:26:34,102 --> 01:26:36,093
He helped us some.

881
01:26:44,702 --> 01:26:47,296
That's the richest gift a body could have.

882
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:52,450
And your presents are in the
cupboard under the china closet.

883
01:26:53,982 --> 01:26:55,381
Ruby.

884
01:26:57,062 --> 01:26:59,053
This is yours.

885
01:27:14,182 --> 01:27:18,221
Lord save little children.
You'd think the world'd be ashamed

886
01:27:18,302 --> 01:27:22,932
to name such a day as Christmas for one
of them, then go on in the same old way.

887
01:27:24,102 --> 01:27:28,459
My soul is humble when I see the way
little ones accept their lot.

888
01:27:29,782 --> 01:27:31,852
Lord save little children.

889
01:27:31,942 --> 01:27:34,251
The wind blows and the rains are cold...

890
01:27:35,222 --> 01:27:37,213
yet they abide.

891
01:28:04,262 --> 01:28:06,571
That watch sure is a fine loud ticker.

892
01:28:08,262 --> 01:28:12,892
Be nice to have someone round the house
who can give me the right time of day.

893
01:28:12,982 --> 01:28:15,496
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.

894
01:28:16,182 --> 01:28:20,300
Well, a fella just can't go around
with run-down, busted watches.

895
01:28:26,422 --> 01:28:28,413
They abide and they endure.
