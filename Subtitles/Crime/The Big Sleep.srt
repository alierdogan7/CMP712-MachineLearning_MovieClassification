(DOOR BUZZER RINGS)

2
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,658
MARLOWE: My name's Marlowe.
General Sternwood wanted to see me.

3
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,912
Yes, Mr. Marlowe.
Will you come in, please, sir?

4
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,834
- I'll tell the General that you're here.
- Thank you.

5
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,516
Morning.

6
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,564
You're not very tall, are you?

7
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,567
Well, I tried to be.

8
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,030
Not bad-looking,

9
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,366
though you probably know it.

10
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,742
Thank you.

11
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,204
- What's your name?
- Reilly. Doghouse Reilly.

12
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,999
That's a funny kind of name.

13
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,334
- You think so?
- Uh-huh.

14
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,963
What are you? A prizefighter?

15
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,048
- No, I'm a shamus.
- What's a shamus?

16
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,218
- A private detective.
- You're making fun of me.

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,386
Uh-huh.

18
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,185
(GIGGLES)

19
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,354
You're cute.

20
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,564
(DOORS OPEN)

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,650
The General will see you now, sir.

22
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,661
- Who's that?
- Miss Carmen Sternwood, sir.

23
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,746
- You ought to wean her. She's old enough.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,927
- This is Mr. Marlowe, General.
- How do you do, sir?

25
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,929
- Sit down, sir.
- Thank you.

26
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,639
Brandy, Norris.

27
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,892
How do you like your brandy, sir?

28
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,602
In a glass.

29
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,313
I used to like mine with champagne.

30
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,440
Champagne cold as Valley Forge

31
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,109
and with about
three ponies of brandy under it.

32
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,777
Come, come, man. Pour a decent one.

33
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,822
I like to see people drink.

34
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,617
That'll do, Norris.

35
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,328
You may take off your coat, sir.

36
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,954
MARLOWE: Thank you.

37
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,790
Too hot in here for any man
who has any blood in his veins.

38
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,669
GEN. STERNWOOD: You may smoke, too.

39
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,713
I can still enjoy the smell of it.

40
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:40,010
Nice state of affairs when a man
has to indulge his vices by proxy.

41
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,723
You're looking, sir, at a very dull
survival of a very gaudy life.

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,935
Crippled, paralyzed in both legs.

43
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,479
Very little I can eat,
and my sleep is so near waking

44
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,314
that it's hardly worth the name.

45
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,776
I seem to exist largely on heat,
like a newborn spider.

46
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,319
Yeah.

47
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,947
The orchids are an excuse for the heat.

48
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,866
- Do you like orchids?
- Not particularly.

49
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,159
Nasty things.

50
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,995
Their flesh is too much
like the flesh of men.

51
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,082
Their perfume has
the rotten sweetness of corruption.

52
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,545
Tell me about yourself, Mr. Marlowe.

53
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,216
There isn't much to tell.
I'm 38. I went to college.

54
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,927
I can still speak English
when my business demands it.

55
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,971
I used to work for
the district attorney's office.

56
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,682
It was Bernie Ohls, his Chief Inspector,
sent word you wanted to see me.

57
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,643
You didn't like working
for the district attorney, eh?

58
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,148
I was fired for insubordination.
I seem to rate pretty high on that.

59
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,775
Yeah.

60
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,735
I always did, myself.

61
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,697
What do you know about my family,
Mr. Marlowe?

62
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,700
Well, you're a widower, a millionaire.

63
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,201
You have two young daughters.

64
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,245
One unmarried
and one married a couple of years ago

65
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,955
to a man named Rutledge,
but it didn't take.

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,666
- Both living with you and both...
- Go on, sir.

67
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,919
Both pretty, and both pretty wild.

68
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,047
MARLOWE: What'd you want
to see me about?

69
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,465
I'm being blackmailed again.

70
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,050
Again?

71
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,387
GEN. STERNWOOD: About a year ago,
I paid a man named Joe Brody $5,000

72
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,514
- to let my younger daughter alone.
- Hm.

73
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,142
- What does that mean?
- (CHUCKLES)

74
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,936
It means, "Hm!"

75
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,896
It didn't go through
the district attorney's office

76
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,315
or I would've heard about it.

77
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,567
- Who handled it for you?
- Shawn Regan.

78
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,943
Shawn Regan?

79
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,029
There must be some reason
why he isn't handling it this time.

80
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,031
- What is it?
- Shawn has left me.

81
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,366
I thought I hadn't seen him around lately.

82
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,785
About a month ago, without a word.

83
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,081
I had no claim on him.
I was only his employer.

84
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,460
But I had hoped that he'd come
to regard me as something more than that.

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,379
And that at least he'd have said goodbye.

86
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,341
That was what hurt.

87
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,469
You knew him too?

88
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes, in the old days when he
used to run rum out of Mexico

89
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,932
and I was on the other side.

90
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,851
We used to swap shots between drinks

91
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,686
or drinks between shots,
whichever you like.

92
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,271
(CHUCKLES)

93
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,357
My respects to you, sir.

94
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,985
Few men ever swapped more than
one shot with Shawn Regan.

95
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,781
He commanded a brigade
in the Irish Republican Army.

96
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,867
- But then you knew that.
- No, I didn't.

97
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,952
Oh, help yourself, sir.

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,413
I know he was a good man
at whatever he did.

99
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,709
No one was more pleased than I when
I heard you'd taken him on here as your...

100
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,169
Whatever he was.

101
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,796
My friend.

102
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,798
My son, almost.

103
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,424
(LAUGHS)

104
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,010
Many an hour he sat here with me,
sweating like a pig,

105
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,638
drinking the brandy
I could no longer drink

106
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,556
and telling stories
of the Irish Revolution.

107
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,809
Well, enough of that.

108
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,143
Here.

109
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,738
GEN. STERNWOOD: Read the other side.

110
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,675
- These her signatures?
- Yes.

111
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,011
- Who's Arthur Gwynn Geiger?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

112
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,347
- Did you ask her?
- No, and I don't intend to.

113
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,683
If I did, she'd just suck
her thumb and look coy.

114
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,228
Yeah, I met her in the hall.
She did that to me.

115
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,481
Then she tried to sit on my lap
while I was standing up.

116
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,816
GEN. STERNWOOD: Well?

117
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,362
Your other daughter, Mrs. Rutledge.
She mixed up in this?

118
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,989
- No.
- They alike? They run around together?

119
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,409
They're alike only in having
the same corrupt blood.

120
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,372
Vivian is spoiled, exacting,
smart and ruthless.

121
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,127
Carmen is still a little child
who likes to pull the wings off flies.

122
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,173
GEN. STERNWOOD: I assume
they have all the usual vices,

123
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,717
besides those they've
invented for themselves.

124
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,220
If I seem a bit sinister
as a parent, Mr. Marlowe,

125
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:57,184
it's because my hold on life is too slight
to include any Victorian hypocrisy.

126
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,020
I need hardly add that any man
who has lived as I have

127
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:04,357
and who indulges, for the first time,
in parenthood, at my age,

128
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,234
deserves all he gets.

129
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,278
GEN. STERNWOOD: Well?

130
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,161
Pay him.

131
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,498
- Why?
- She signed these notes, didn't she?

132
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,874
Yes.

133
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,589
Who's this Joe Brody
you paid the $5,000 to?

134
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,634
I can't recall.
My butler, Norris, would know.

135
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,553
I think he called himself a gambler.

136
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,805
Geiger says these are gambling debts.

137
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,724
They may be.

138
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,267
Think they are?

139
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,602
No.

140
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,897
I guess you want me
to take this Geiger off your back,

141
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,106
- is that right?
- Yes.

142
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,900
Want to know anything
or just get rid of him?

143
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,610
I just want to get rid of him.

144
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,612
It may cost you a little.

145
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,907
Thanks for the drink, General.

146
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,618
I enjoyed your drink
as much as you did, sir.

147
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,828
- You'll hear from me.
- Good luck.

148
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

149
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,345
Mr. Marlowe, Mrs. Rutledge would like
to see you before you leave, sir.

150
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,180
And about the money,

151
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,517
the General has instructed me to
give you a check for whatever you require.

152
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,310
Instructed you how?

153
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,605
Oh, I see, sir.
I forget that you're a detective.

154
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,066
- By the way he rang his bell, sir.
- Ah.

155
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,193
- You write his checks?
- I have that privilege.

156
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,279
Good for you. I don't need any money now,

157
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,531
but when I do,
I get $25 a day and expenses.

158
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,699
Yes, sir.

159
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,077
- How did Mrs. Rutledge know I was here?
- She saw you through the window, sir.

160
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,038
And I was obliged
to tell her who you were.

161
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,540
I don't know as I like that.

162
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,334
Are you attempting
to tell me my duties, sir?

163
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,670
No, just having fun
trying to guess what they are.

164
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,338
This way, sir.

165
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,760
- Go right in and say you're expected.
- Thanks.

166
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,850
You wanted to see me?

167
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,275
So you're a private detective?

168
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,235
I didn't know they existed,
except in books.

169
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,614
Or else they were greasy little men
snooping around hotel corridors.

170
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,532
My, you're a mess, aren't you?

171
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,908
(SCOFFS)

172
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,202
I'm not very tall either.

173
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,539
Next time I'll come on stilts, wear
a white tie and carry a tennis racket.

174
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,167
I doubt if even that would help.

175
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,046
Now, this business of Dad's,
think you can handle it for him?

176
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,756
- It shouldn't be too tough.
- Really?

177
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,549
I would've thought
a case like that took a little effort.

178
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,925
Not too much.

179
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,720
What will your first step be?

180
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,056
- The usual one.
- I didn't know there was a usual one.

181
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,892
Sure there is. It comes complete
with diagrams, on page 47 of

182
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,562
How to be a Detective in 10 Easy Lessons,
correspondence school text-book.

183
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,189
And your father offered me a drink.

184
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,566
You must've read another one
on how to be a comedian.

185
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,817
Hear what I said about the drink?

186
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,527
I'm quite serious, Mr. Marlowe.
My father's not a...

187
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,113
- I said your father...
- Help yourself.

188
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,994
Now, look, Mr. Marlowe,
my father's not well

189
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,955
and I want this case handled
with the least possible worry to him.

190
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,208
That's just the way
I was going to handle it.

191
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,252
- I see. No professional secrets?
- No.

192
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,588
- I thought you wanted a drink.
- I changed my mind.

193
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,173
Then, what...

194
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,805
- How'd you like Dad?
- I liked him.

195
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,307
He liked Shawn. Shawn Regan.

196
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,810
- I suppose you know who he is.
- Uh-huh.

197
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,105
You don't have to play poker with me,
Mr. Marlowe.

198
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,440
- Dad wants to find him, doesn't he?
- Do you?

199
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,777
Of course I do. It wasn't right
for him to go off like that.

200
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,113
Broke Dad's heart,
although he won't say much about it.

201
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,699
- Or did he?
- Why don't you ask him?

202
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,660
You know, I don't see what there is
to be cagey about, Mr. Marlowe.

203
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,953
And I don't like your manners!

204
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,956
I'm not crazy about yours.
I didn't ask to see you.

205
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,375
I don't mind if you don't like my manners.
I don't like 'em myself.

They're pretty bad.
I grieve over them long winter evenings,

207

or drinking your lunch out of a bottle.

208

But don't waste your time
trying to cross-examine me.

209
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,218
- People don't talk to me like that!
- Oh!

211

- like trained seals?
- Uh-huh.

212
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,979
I usually get away with it too.

213
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,148
How nice for you.

214
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,525
Just what is it you're afraid of?

215
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,738
Dad didn't want to see you
about Shawn at all, did he?

216
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,114
Didn't he?

217
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,199
Could you find him if Dad wanted you to?

218
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,701
Maybe. When did he go?

219
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,411
About a month back.

220
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,955
Just drove off one afternoon
without saying a word.

221
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,791
They found his car
parked in some private garage.

223

Dad didn't tell you, then.

224
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,799
Yes, he told me about Regan, but that's
not what he wants to see me about.

225
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,968
That's what you've been trying to
get me to say, isn't it?

what you say, Mr. Marlowe.

- MARLOWE: Good evening, Mrs. Rutledge.
- Hello.

340
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,277
I've got your sister outside.

341
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,696
She's all right,
but she's not walking very well.

342
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,114
I'll need some help.

343
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,845
- Are you sure that she's...
- Yeah, she'll be all right in the morning.

344
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,103
- Did you do this?
- That?

345
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:08,065
Yes, that's a little special service
I always provide all my clients.

346
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,818
Including being insolent.

347
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,987
- Where did you find her?
- I didn't find her.

348
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,989
- Well, then how...
- I haven't been here. You haven't seen me

349
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,824
and she hasn't been
out of this house all evening.

350
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,951
- That bad?
- Mmm-hmm.

351
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,287
Just what did happen, Mr. Marlowe?

352
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,330
You're pretty fond of your sister,
aren't you?

353
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,040
- Yes, I am.
- You'd do anything for her, wouldn't you?

354
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,459
- Anything.
- Then drop this whole thing.

355
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,588
- But I still think I should know what...
- Uh-uh. Don't even ask her.

356
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,174
She never remembers, anyway.

357
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,136
Just what did she forget
about Shawn Regan?

358
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,766
What did she tell you?

359
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,103
Not half as much as you just did.

360
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,105
Take it easy.

361
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,275
I don't slap so good
around this time of the evening.

You go too far, Marlowe.

364
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,366
Ooh. Those are harsh words
to throw at a man.

365
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,869
Especially when he's walking
out of your bedroom.

366
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,579
Good night, Mrs. Rutledge.

367
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,875
Thanks, Norris.

368
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,544
- I've put her car away, sir.
- That's fine.

369
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,379
If anybody asks,
she's been in all evening,

370
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,714
and forget about my being here.

371
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,216
I understand, sir.
May I call a cab for you, sir?

372
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,260
No, it'd be better if you didn't.
I'll be all right.

373
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,553
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

- Yeah.

I just started this afternoon,
then the rain came.

390
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,790
All right. They seem to be
a family that things happen to.

391
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,666
There's a big Packard
belonging to one of them,

- Hmm.

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,589
And I almost forgot there's a guy in it.

- Couldn't be Regan, could it?
- Who?

00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,221
You mean that Irish ex-legger
old Sternwood hired

397
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,389
- to do his drinking for him?
- Yeah.

398
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,767
What would he be doing down there?

399
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,393
What would anybody be doing down there?

00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,981
That's what I'm going to Lido to find out.
You want to come along?

Yeah, I do.

- Clearing up.

- Hello, Bernie.
- Hi, Ed.

407
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,930
I see you got him out. Who is he?

408
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,849
His name's Owen Taylor.
General Sternwood's chauffeur,

409
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,517
according to his driver's license.

410
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,936
- What's the story?
- You can see most of it from here.

411
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,564
There's where he went through the railing.
Must've hit it pretty hard.

412
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,649
The rain stopped down here about 9:00 p.m.

413
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,359
The broken ends of the rails
are dry inside.

414
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,486
That would put it about 9:30.

415
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,196
All right, put her down.

416
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,247
All right, Doc, let's have it.

417
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,458
His neck was broken and something
hit him hard across the left temple.

418
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,627
- What made the bruise? Steering wheel?
- Mm-mm.

419
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,296
Whatever it was, it was covered.

420
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,591
Because the wound had already bled under
the skin while he was still alive.

421
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,467
- Blackjack?
- Could be.

422
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,969
Hey, Bernie, funny thing.

423
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,430

is set halfway down.

424

Thanks, Jim. So long, Doc.

- All right, boys. Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

426
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,733
- Could be drunk or a suicide.
- Yeah, but it isn't.

427
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,985
You know anything about this Owen Taylor?

428
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,820
Only that two or three
of the Sternwood chauffeurs

429
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,823
lost their jobs on account
of the younger daughter, Carmen.

430
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,618
You better tell me
what you're working on, Phil.

431
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,536
They told me blackmail.

432
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,538
- Who were they after? Carmen?
- Yeah.

433
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,917
This doesn't look like
the way you'd handle it.

434
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,002
You know, I got a feeling that...

435
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,838
Me? I didn't do this.

436
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,674
What were you going to say, Phil?

437
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,928
Give me another day, Bernie.
I may have something for you.

438
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,554
Okay. Let's go home.

439
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,609
- Good morning.
- So you do get up.

440
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,570
I was beginning to think perhaps
you worked in bed like Marcel Proust.

441
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,073
- Who's he?
- You wouldn't know him. A French writer.

442
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,993
Come into my boudoir.

443
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,170
You don't put on much of a front, do you?

444
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,089
There isn't much money in this business
if you're honest.

445
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,800
- Are you honest?
- Are we gonna start that again?

446
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,719
I'm sorry. Also about yesterday.
Perhaps I was rude.

447
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,721
We were both rude.

448
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,890
You want to see me about Taylor?

449
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,018
So you know about that? Poor Owen.

450
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,604
Yeah. The DA's man took me
down to Lido last night.

451
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,023
Turned out he knew more about it
than I did.

452
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,609
For instance, he knew that Owen Taylor
wanted to marry your sister once.

453
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,112
Perhaps it wouldn't have been
such a bad idea.

454
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,572
You see, he was in love with her.

455
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,908
But I didn't come here about Owen. I...

456
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,246
Do you still feel you can't tell me
what my father wants you to do?

457
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,580
Not without his permission.

458
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,416
You can't even tell me
if it was about Carmen?

459
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,583
No.

460
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,629
You better look at this.
A messenger brought it this morning.

461
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,757
- 8:35.
- That's right.

462
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,970
She takes a nice picture.

463
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,931
They want $5,000 for the negative
and the rest of the prints.

464
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,349
The demand came how?

465
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,560
A woman telephoned me
shortly after this thing was delivered.

466
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,146
- What else was there?
- Does there have to be something else?

467
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,398
Well, this thing
isn't worth $5,000 to anybody.

468
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,233
- Well, they think it is.
- Why?

469
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,569
The woman said
if they didn't get the money today,

470
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,280
I'd be talking to my sister
through a wire screen.

471
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,491
She said there was a police jam
connected with it.

472
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,826
What kind of a jam?

473
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:58,994
I don't know.

474
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,956
You know where this picture was taken?

475
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,499
I haven't the slightest idea.

476
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,251
- Or when?
- No.

477
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,962
- Talked to Carmen about it?
- She was asleep when I left.

478
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,922
Figure out a story?

479
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,883
- Norris fixed that.
- How?

480
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,177
She was in all evening.

481
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,929
Police already checked that
when they called about Owen.

482
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,723
Go ahead and scratch.

483
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,145
What was Owen doing
with your car last night?

484
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,814
Nobody knows.
He took it without permission.

485
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,107
Why? Do you think that...

486
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,485
That he knew about this picture?
I don't rule him out.

487
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,571
Then outside of what the woman said,

488
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,157
you don't know any reason
why they want $5,000 for it?

489
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,661
That's why I came to you.

490
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,706
There's usually five fingers on any glove.
Why didn't you go to the police?

491
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,083
- Because I thought...
- 'Cause you were afraid

492
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,001
they might turn up something
that I couldn't sit on.

493
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,378
Then where would the Sternwoods be?
Isn't that right?

494
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,756
May I use your phone, Mr. Marlowe?

495
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,015
Hello. Police headquarters, please.

Hello. What do you want, please?

498
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,149
I don't want a thing.

499
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,611
- What? I called you? Say, who is this?
- You called me.

500
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,821
Sergeant Reilly at headquarters.

501
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,115
Sergeant Reilly? Well, there isn't
any Sergeant Reilly here.

502
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,282
I know that, but look, brother...

503
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,034
Now, wait a minute,
you better talk to my mother.

504
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,869
I don't wanna talk to your mother.

505
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,163
Why should I wanna talk to your mother?
She didn't...

506
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,623
Hello. Who's this?

507
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,417
The police?
Well, this isn't a police station.

508
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,378
Well, if you know it, then why did you...

509
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,797
Look, this is not a police station.

510
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,467
What was that you said? (CHUCKLES)

511
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,719
My father should hear this.

512
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,389
No, I don't want to talk to your father
or to his mother.

513
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,474
- Hello. Who is this?
- This is the police talking.

514
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,518
- Yeah, but she just told you that...
- I'm the police.

515
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,437
Oh, you're the police.
Oh, he's the police. That's different.

516
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,064
What can I do for you?

517
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,526
I can do what? Where?

518
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,737
Oh, no, I wouldn't like that
and neither would my daughter.

519
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,408
I hope the sergeant
never traces that call.

520
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,827
- You like to play games, don't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

521
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,746
Why did you stop me phoning?

522
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,707
'Cause I'm working for your father.

523
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,210
Or, because I think I'm beginning
to like another one of the Sternwoods.

524
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,213
I prefer the second reason.

525
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,757
Well, let's get back to business.

526
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,677
- Have you got $5,000 in cash?
- No.

527
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,512
- Can you get it?
- I think so.

528
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,599
- Where from? Your father?
- I'd rather not.

529
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,017
Where would you get it?

530
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,562
- Well, from Eddie Mars.
- The gambler?

531
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,273
Well, that explains why you haven't
got $5,000 in cash.

532
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,400
- I like gambling.
- So do I.

533
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,943
How do you know he'll give it to you?

534
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,280
Oh, I can get the money.
I've been a good customer of Eddie Mars.

535
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:45,076
Another reason, there's a bond between
Mr. Mars and the Sternwoods.

536
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,289
You see, Shawn Regan ran off
with Eddie's wife.

537
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,041
That doesn't interest you?

538
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,377
Might make it easier for me to find him.

539
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,255
That is if I were looking for him.

540
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,218
- Is Regan mixed up in this?
- No.

541
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,470
No, Shawn's not in any
cheap blackmailing scheme.

542
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,972
I'm glad you said that.
Do you want to tell me now?

543
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,808
- Tell you what?
- What it is you're trying to find out.

544
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,061
You know, it's a funny thing.

545
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,480
You're trying to find out what
your father hired me to find out.

546
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,482
And I'm trying to find out
why you want to find out.

547
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,651
You could go on forever, couldn't you?

548
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,070
Anyway, it'll give us something
to talk about next time we meet.

549
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,697
Among other things. Oh, Mrs. Rutledge,

550
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,283
you wanted me to do something about this,
didn't you?

551
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,493
Mmm-hmm.

552
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,495
That woman who called. How'd you leave it?

553
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,664
She's to call me back at 6:00 this evening
with instructions.

554
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,457
All right, you phone me
as soon as you've heard from her.

555
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,667
- All right.
- Oh, and Mrs. Rutledge,

556
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,669
as long as you're gonna pay five grand
for the rest of these,

557
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,087
you better take this one with you.

558
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,755
Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe.

559
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,219
Well, it wasn't intentional.

560
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,720
Try it sometime.

561
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,522
- Well, I'm back again. Remember me?
- I'm afraid I...

562
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,777
Do you remember me now? Hmm?

563
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,238
- Now, see here! What's the big idea?
- Take it easy, sister.

564
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,240
That was only a stall
about those first editions.

565
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,491
- What are you...
- I got something to sell.

566
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,035
Something Geiger's wanted for a long time.
Is Geiger in?

567
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,163
No. No, he isn't.
You might come back tomorrow...

568
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,666
Drop the veil, sister.
I'm in the business myself.

569
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,168
I haven't got all day. Is he sick?
I could go to his house.

570
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,546
No, that wouldn't do.
Perhaps if you'd come back tomorrow...

571
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,965
Say, Agnes, you...

572
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,217
Come on, Carol.

573
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,763
Hurry up, will you?

574
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,891
- Perhaps you could...
- His name's Lundgren, isn't it?

575
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,727
- Just what do you want?
- Who's the other guy?

576
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,603
You'd better come around tomorrow.

577
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,189
- In the morning? Early?
- Yes, early.

578
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,692
Because it looks like you're moving today.

579
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,581
- All right, driver. Let's go.
- Okay.

580
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,713
Around the corner, then take it easy.

581
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,383
- Where are we going?
- Follow a car. A tail job.

582
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,760
I'm your girl, bud.

583
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,511
It wouldn't be bad.

584
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,930
That station wagon
coming out of the alley.

585
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,557
That's the one.

586
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,397
Here you are, sugar. Buy yourself a cigar.

587
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,566
If you can use me again sometime,
call this number.

588
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,901
Day and night?

589
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,654
Uh, night's better. I work during the day.

590
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,315
- What're you...
- Remember me? I'm Doghouse Reilly,

591
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,526
the man that didn't grow very tall.

592
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,945
What's the matter?
Couldn't you get in the house?

593
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,865
Come on. I've got a key.

594
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,119
- Where'd you leave your car?
- 'Round in back.

595
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,679
- You looking for something?
- I just...

596
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,015
How much do you remember about last night?

597
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,850
Remember what?

598
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,518
I was sick last night. I was home.

599
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,645
I mean before you went home.
In that chair there.

600
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,731
- I...
- Uh-huh. You remember, all right.

601
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,318
Quit your stalling
and stop biting your thumb.

602
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,529
- Were you the one who was here last night?
- How much do you remember?

603
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:35,617
- Well, are you the police?
- No, I'm a friend of your father's.

604
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,202
Who killed Geiger?

605
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,579
I... Who else knows about it?

606
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,748
What, that he's dead? I don't know.

607
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,708
Certainly not the cops
or they'd be camping here.

608
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,627
Was it Joe Brody?

609
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,629
Joe Brody? Who's he?

610
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,090
Now, look, sister. I don't know
how much trouble you're used to,

611
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,052
but I hope you've had
plenty of practice dodging it.

612
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,513
- Did Brody kill him?
- Kill who?

613
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,889
Ahh.

614
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,977
Yes. Yes, Joe did it.

615
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,771
He did?

616
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,607
Why?

617
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
I don't know.

618
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,278
But you're ready
to tell the police he did it, huh?

619
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,155
That is, if we can get
the photograph he's got.

620
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,615
- You mean...
- Oh, yes, it's gone.

621
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,159
I looked for it last night.
Brody took it with him.

622
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,786
- I've got to go home now.
- Uh-uh.

623
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,415
All right, but I wouldn't say anything
to the police about Brody just yet.

624
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,918
As a matter of fact,
I wouldn't say anything about anything,

625
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,628
that you were ever here
last night or today.

626
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,296
Not even to your sister.

627
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,090
Just leave it to Reilly.

628
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,300
Your name isn't Reilly.

629
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,468
(DOORBELL BUZZING)

630
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,932
(DOORKNOB RATTLING)

631
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,359
Excuse the casual entrance.
The bell didn't answer.

632
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:53,945
Mr. Geiger around?

633
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,655
No, we don't know just where he is.

634
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,907
We found the door open
and we just stepped in.

635
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,077
Friends of his?

636
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,288
Business. We dropped in for a book,
but we missed him.

637
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,540
Any message if he comes back?

638
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,042
No, I don't think so. We won't bother you.

639
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,253
Just a minute.

640
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,506
The girl can go. I'd like to talk to you...

641
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,508
Suppose I don't want to talk to you?

642
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,218
I've got two boys outside in the car.

643
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,013
Oh! Oh, it's like that, eh?

644
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,264
Mmm-hmm.

645
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,391
Run along, angel.

646
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,108
Your story didn't sound quite right.

647
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,277
Well, that's too bad.
You got a better one?

648
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,113
Maybe I can find one.

649
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,164
Blood. Quite a lot of blood.

650
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,707
Is that so?

651
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,209
- Do you mind?
- No, I'm used to it.

652
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,004
I think we'll let the police in on this.

653
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,465
- We'll have some law...
- Yeah, why not?

654
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,051
Who are you, soldier?

655
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,053
Marlowe's my name.
I'm a private detective.

656
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,596
- Who's the girl?
- Client of mine.

657
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,641
Geiger tried to throw a loop on her,
so we came up here to talk things over.

658
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,809
Convenient, the door being open
when you didn't have a key.

659
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,853
Yeah, wasn't it? By the way,
how'd you happen to have one?

660
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,855
- Is that any of your business?
- I could make it my business.

661
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,065
I could make your business mine.

662
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,566
You wouldn't like it. The pay's too small.

663
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,777
(CHUCKLES)

664
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,988
All right, I own this house.
Geiger's my tenant.

665
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,741
- Now, what do you think of it?
- You know some nice people.

666
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,409
I take 'em as they come.

667
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,579
- You got any good ideas, soldier?
- One or two.

668
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,874
Somebody gunned Geiger, or somebody got
gunned by Geiger who ran away.

669
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,002
Or he had meat for dinner and likes to

Don't you, Mr. Mars?

674
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,179
I wondered why
you didn't ask me who I was.

00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,306
You seem to be telling me

- I wouldn't know. I'm not his landlord.

But I'll tell you something you missed.

- Now, I'm not ruining...
- What cops?

all that lead in Geiger's body came from.

Look, Joe, you shot Geiger.

- I didn't know that...
- The cops don't yet.

779

The trouble is he wasn't alone
when you shot him.

780
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,442
Either you didn't notice that
and I think you did

781
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,402
or you got scared and ran away.

782
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,612
But you had nerve enough
to take the film out of the camera

783
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,323
and you had nerve enough
to come back later and hide the body.

- Shut up.

from somebody who was there.

800
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,860
You knew Carmen was there

801
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,238
because you had your girlfriend here
threaten Mrs. Rutledge with the police.

802
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,990
Now, the only way
you could have known enough to do that

803
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,992
was by being there
and seeing what happened

804
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,161

and knowing when and where it was taken.

- That goes for me, too.

838
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,778
Well, you got your pictures. Get out.

839
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,488
- Where does he give you a pain?
- Right in my...

840
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,656
Get out!

841
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,159
Not yet. We got a few things
to straighten out.

842
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,535
I told you to get out.

843
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,579
Go on, Joe.
What difference does it make now?

844
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,789
Why'd you put the bee on Mrs. Rutledge?

845
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,042
Well, I tapped the old man once,
six or seven months ago.

846
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,376
I figured it might not work twice.

847
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,879
Well, what made you think
Mrs. Rutledge wouldn't tell him about it?

848
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,465
- How well do you know her?
- We'll pass that.

849
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,799
Well, she gets around.

850
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,969
I figured she might have a thing or two
she wouldn't want the old man to know.

851
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,388
That's a little weak,
but we'll pass that, too.

852
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,682
Say, Joe, how'd you get that picture?

853
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,143
Look, you got what you came for,
and you got it cheap.

854
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,562
I don't know anything about a picture.
Do I, Agnes?

855
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,105
Yeah, but Joe,
you just gave me the picture.

856
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,816
You're a half-smart guy.
That's what I always draw.

857
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:01,654
Never once a man who's smart
all the way around the course. Never once.

858
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,113
Did I hurt you much, sugar?

You and every other man I've ever met.

860
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,242
Say, Joe, where'd you get that picture?

861
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,077
It fell out of somebody's pocket.

862
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,495
You got an alibi for last night?

863
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,163
I was right here with Agnes.

864
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,331
Huh.

865
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,999
That's a great witness.

866
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,169
Okay, Joe, you can only die once,
even for a couple of murders.

867
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,754
Wait a minute,
what do you mean, a couple of murders?

868
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,257
I mean two murders.
Where were you about 7:30 last night?

869
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,175
- Why, I...
- Where were you?

870
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,344
All right, I was watching Geiger's place.

871
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,762
Why?

872
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,015
- To get something on him.
- Try looking at me while you're talking.

873
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,518
Well, it was raining hard
and I was sitting in my car.

874
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,354
There was a car parked out front
and another part way down the hill.

875
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,522
I was in back.

876
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,440
- Who else was back there?
- Nobody.

877
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,484
There was a big Packard near where I was.

878
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,861
So I took a look at it
and it was registered to the Sternwoods.

879
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,029
And then?

880
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:47,908
Well, then, nothing happened,
so I got tired of waiting and went home.

881
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,369
- You know where that Packard is now?
- How should I?

882
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,413
It's in the sheriff's garage.

883
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,000
It was fished out of 12 feet of water
off Lido Pier early this morning.

884
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,876
There was a dead man in it.
He'd been sapped.

885
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,712
The car was pointed
toward the end of the pier

886
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:00,879
and the hand throttle pulled out.

887
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,131
Why, you can't pin that on me.

888
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,382
I can make an awful good try at it.

889
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,134
- Why, I...
- Sit down, Joe.

890
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,472
You see, the dead man was Owen Taylor,
Sternwood's chauffer.

891
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,058
He went up to Geiger's place
because he was sweet on Carmen.

892
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:16,020
He didn't like the kind of games
Geiger was playing.

893
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,148
He let himself in the back way
with a jimmy, and he had a gun.

894
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,985
And the gun went off, as guns will,
and Geiger fell down dead.

895
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,903
So Owen ran away taking the film with him.

896
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,822
You went after him and got it.
How else would you get it?

897
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,073
All right, you're right.

898
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,284
I heard the shots and saw him
run down the back steps

899
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,744
and enter the Packard and away.

900
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,579
- Yeah.
- I followed him.

901
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,290
He turned west on Sunset.

902
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,208
And beyond Beverly,

903
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:42,463
he, uh, skidded off the road
and, uh, came to a stop.

904
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,923
So I came up and played copper.

905
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:48,552
He had a gun and he was rattled,
so I sapped him down.

906
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,597
I figured the film might be
worth something, so I took it.

907
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,932
That's the last I saw of him.

908
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:58,562
So you left an unconscious man
in a car way out near Beverly someplace.

909
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,273
And you want me to believe that
somebody conveniently came along,

910
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,151
ran that car all the way down
to the ocean, pushed it off the pier

911
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,111
and then came back and hid Geiger's body?

912
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,155
- Well, I didn't.
- Somebody did.

913
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,741
And you wanted time to take over.

914
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,618
You can't prove I did it.

915
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,787
I don't particularly want to.

916
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:18,165
All I want to do is find out
what Geiger had on the Sternwoods.

917
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:22,002
Well, maybe you and I
can make a little deal.

918

1004
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,787
- Find out mine?
- I think so.

1005
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,538
Go ahead.

1006
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,957
I'd say you don't like to be rated.

1007
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:19,336
You like to get out in front,
open up a lead,

1008
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:22,172
take a little breather
in the back stretch,

1009
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,716
and then come home free.

1010
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,552
You don't like to be rated yourself.

1012

over a distance of ground.

1015

but I don't know how far you can go.

1016
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,985
A lot depends on who's in the saddle.

Go ahead, Marlowe,
I like the way you work.

you're doing all right.

There's one thing I can't figure out.

1020
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:53,954

- Uh-huh.

1021
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,455

1022
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:57,666
Sugar won't work. It's been tried.

1023
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,043
Then what'd you try it on me for?

1024
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,920
Who told you to sugar me off this case?

1025
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,089
Was it Eddie Mars?

1026
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,717
All right, don't answer me.

1027
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,594
But somebody put you up to it
and it wasn't your father.

1028
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,346
He didn't tell you to pay me off, did he?

1029
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,140
No, he's not well. I used my own judgment.

1030
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,559
Are you sure?

1031
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,103
Of course, I know it hasn't worked
so well up till now.

What's Eddie Mars
got to do with this case?

1033
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,399
Nothing. He runs a gambling house.

Did you know he owned
the house Geiger operated in?

1041
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,539
And that he was mixed up
in that racket, too?

1042

No. I don't believe it.

Go on, spin the wheel.

1169
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,072
I want another play.

1170
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,199
I'm sorry. You have
more than $14,000 there,

1171
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,909
and the table cannot cover your bet.

1172
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,703
It's your money. Don't you want it back?

1173
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:32,954
I have sent for Mr. Mars.

1174
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,039
- Look, lady, you... Why, no, I...
- Do you want to cover it?

1175
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:36,624
- Hello, Marlowe.
- Hello.

1176
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:40,086
The lady.

1177
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,546
Something the matter, Mrs. Rutledge?

1178
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:42,880
Yes, I'd like one more play, Eddie.

1179
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:45,258
All this on the red.

1180
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,218
Cover her bet in even thousands,

1181
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,720
if no one objects
to this turn of the wheel

1182
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:50,513
being for the lady alone.

1183
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:51,723
Wish me luck, Marlowe.

1184
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,475
You wanted to see me.

1185
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,395
Yes. The people I came with want to stay,

1186
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,772
so I thought maybe
you'd like to drive me home.

1187
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,982
Sure.

1188
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,401
- DEALER: Are you ready, lady?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

1189
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:04,902
So am I.

1190
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,294
Number five, red.

1191
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:23,796
(CROWD CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)

1192
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,092
Well, you did all right.

1193
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,136
I'll get my car while you're collecting.

1194
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,929
Meet you outside.

1195
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:37,352
- Cash these in.
- DEALER: Ten, eleven...

1196
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,502
MAN: Good night.
VIVIAN: Good night.

1197
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,022
This is a gun, lady.

1198
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,190
GANGSTER: I want that money.

1199
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:07,525
Yell, and I'll cut you in half.

1200
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,068
Give me that bag.

1201
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,865
Hello, pal. Easy.

1202
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:17,493
Somebody is always giving me guns.

1203
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:18,828
You can turn around now.

1204
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:22,373
I don't like people who play games.

1205
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,583
Tell your boss

1206
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:26,043
when you wake up.

1207
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,675
Well, I'm glad I asked you
to take me home.

1208
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,177
So am I.

1209
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:35,636
Shall we go now?

1210
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:36,846
Uh-huh.

1211
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:44,979
What are you trembling for?

1212
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,190
Don't tell me you were scared
because I won't believe that.

1213
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:49,567
I'm not used to being hijacked.
Give me a little time.

1214
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,819
Hijacked? Is that what it was?

1215
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:53,154
What else?

1216
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,084
You're still shaking. What's the matter?

1217
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:09,420
You weren't worried about me, were you?

1218
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,339
Afraid I'd get hurt?

1219
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,008
When did you first begin
to feel that way about me?

1220
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,138
Why are we stopping?

1221
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,848
To settle something.

1222
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:26,354
All right. Let's begin with
what Eddie Mars has on you.

1223
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,606
If he had anything,
would it be any of your business?

1224
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,358
You've already been paid, haven't you?

1225
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,734
Yeah, by you.

1226
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,861
Are you after more money?

1227
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,238
I guess you've got a right to ask that.

1228
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:38,032
No, I'm not after more money.
I've already been well paid.

1229
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,200
I got another reason.

1230
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,452
You like my father, don't you?

1231
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,287
Well, why don't you stop?

1232
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,498
Remember I told you
I was beginning to like

1233
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,166
another one of the Sternwoods?

1234
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:49,126
I wish you'd show it.

1235
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:50,378
That should be awful easy.

1236
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:00,972
I liked that.

1237
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,182
I'd like more.

1238
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,941
That's even better.

1239
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:17,530
All right. Now that's settled,
what's Eddie Mars got on you?

1240
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:21,075
- So that's the way it is?
- That's the way it is.

1241
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:24,203
Kissing you is all right. It's nice.
I'd like to do more of it.

1242
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,289
But first, I want to find out
what Eddie Mars has on you.

1243
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:27,498
If you say that again, I'll...

1244
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,666
I'll keep on saying it until I find out.

1245
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:32,461
Look, angel, I called Eddie Mars
and told him I was coming up to see him.

1246
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,005
When I arrived, you were there.

1247
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:35,214
The two of you staged an act.

1248
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,382
He let you win a lot of money

1249
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,509
and then sent a man around
to take it away from you.

1250
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,845
Just to prove
there was nothing between you.

1251
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:42,763
You're shaking again.

1252
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,307
Take me home.

1253
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:45,933
Sure, I will.

1254
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,685
But first open that bag.

1255
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,855
If there's 28 grand in it,
I'll eat every word I've said.

1256
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,565
Come on, open it and make a sap out of me,

1257
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,108
or else stop playing me for one.

1258
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,318
Take me home.

1259
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:58,696
All right, I'm afraid that's
as far as I'm gonna carry you.

1260
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,032
From now on,
you can take care of yourself.

1261
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,385
Well, what does the hat-check girl
get for a tip?

1262
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:23,054
I'm trying to think
of something appropriate.

1263
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:24,221
How'd you get in here?

1264
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,890
Bet you can't guess.

1265
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,391
I'll bet I can.

1266
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:29,185
You came in through the keyhole
like Peter Pan.

1267
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,394
CARMEN: Who's he?

1268
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:32,813
A guy I used to know around a pool room.

1269
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,191
You're cute.

1270
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,485
I'm getting cuter every minute.
How did you get in?

1271
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,820
I showed the manager your card.
I stole it from Vivian.

1272
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,239
I told him you said to come
up here and wait for you.

1273
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,491
I want...

1274
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:45,576
See, I remembered.

1275
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,745
What do you remember about Shawn Regan?

1276
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,205
I didn't like him.

1277
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,373
Yeah? Why?

1278
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,833
He didn't pay any more attention
to me than you do.

1279
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,502
Treated me like a baby all the time.

1280
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,629
How does Eddie Mars treat you?

1281
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:59,465
- I don't know him.
- You sure?

1282
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:00,841
You know who he is, don't you?

1283
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,094
He's always calling Vivian up. Why?

1284
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:04,261
Is he cute?

1285
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,890
You know, I think
you're telling the truth, for a change.

1286
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,059
Is he as cute as you are?

1287
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:11,602
Nobody is.

1288
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,813
All right, kid, I've had a long day.
You'd better be going.

1289
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,022
Mm-mm.

1290
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,358
- Come on, Carmen. Come on.
- I don't want... I...

1291
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,699
- CARMEN: You can't...
- Shut up.

1292
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:31,706
(PHONE RINGING)

1293
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:36,627
Yeah?

1294
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,212
BERNIE: Hello, Phil.

1295
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,964
Hello, Bernie. What's up?

1296
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,549
I want to see you down here right away.

1297
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,467
I just woke up. I haven't had breakfast.

1298
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:45,469
- It's 2:00.
- 2:00?

1299
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,096
Yeah. If you're not in my office
in 30 minutes,

1300
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:48,556
you'll be eating on the county.

1301
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,976
I'd rather buy my own.
I know that food the county puts out.

1302
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,603
- All right, I'll be there.
- Okay.

1303
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:04,780
Don't you know any better
than to wake a man up

1304
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,240
at 2:00 in the afternoon?

1305
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,200
- What's up?
- I got some orders for you.

1306
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:10,619
You are to lay off the Sternwood case.

1307
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:12,747
- Huh? Who says so?
- The DA.

1308
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,582
The DA, huh?

1309
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,295
He must've changed his mind.

1310
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,506
- Who changed it for him?
- General Sternwood.

1311
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,133
Personally?

1312
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:27,470
All right. Between you and me,
he didn't talk to the General.

1313
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,764
He talked to the daughter, Mrs. Rutledge.

1314
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,098
Oh!

1315
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,018
- Any reason given?
- Not that I know of.

1316
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,438
Well, there's no law says a man
can't work on a case without a client.

1317
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,898
You know, just to keep his hand in.

1318
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:41,025
Now, look, Phil, I'm just supposed
to tell you to lay off...

1319
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,402
I know. You just work here.

1320
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:46,071
Bernie, put yourself in my shoes
for a minute.

1321
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,823
A nice old guy has two daughters.

1322
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,951
One of them is, well, wonderful.
And the other one is not so wonderful.

1323
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,329
As a result,
somebody gets something on her.

1324
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,914
The father hires me to pay off.

1325
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:57,166
Before I can get to the guy,
the family chauffeur kills him.

1326
01:19:57,334 --> 01:20:00,252
But that didn't stop things.
It just starts them.

1327
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:01,462
And two murders later,

1328
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,881
I find out somebody's
got something on Wonderful.

1329
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,216
BERNIE: Who's somebody?

1330
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,343
- I think it's Eddie Mars.
- Why?

1331
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:09,553
For one thing, he owns the house
Geiger was killed in.

1332
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:11,013
He did.

1333
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,058
The day after the murder,
he transfers the deed to a dummy.

1334
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,269
What have you got that
hooks Mars up with Mrs. Rutledge?

1335
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:19,563
Well, last night the two of 'em...

1336
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:21,941
Well, I don't want to bore you
with the whole story,

1337
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:23,400
but they went to the moon to prove to me

1338
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:25,569
there was nothing between 'em,
but I think there is,

1339
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:27,238
and I think it's got something
to do with Shawn Regan.

1340
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,741
Who's missing and supposed to have
run off with Eddie Mars' wife.

1341
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:32,034
Uh-huh.

1342
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,661
What does the General think
about all this?

1343
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,081
I don't know.
Wonderful won't let me get to him.

1344
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,582
You still want me to lay off?

1345
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,001
Well, the DA does,

1346
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:44,421
but you generally do all right
following your own hunches.

1347
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,257
Thanks, Bernie.

1348
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:47,550
Well, I'm going out
and getting some breakfast.

1349
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:48,884
You want a cup of coffee?

1350
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:50,970
Mm-mm.
I can't afford to be seen with you.

1351
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:54,640
Well, so long, Bernie.

1352
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:23,836
NORRIS: Sternwood residence.

1353
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,130
Hello, Norris. This is Marlowe.

1354
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,715
Yes, Mr. Marlowe. I...

1355
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,175
Norris, I'd like to come out
and see General Sternwood.

1356
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:32,303
I don't think
it would be possible, sir, tonight.

1357
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,470
Yeah? Why not?

1358
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,472
I've been trying to call you,
Mr. Marlowe.

1359
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,183
Mrs. Rutledge is very anxious
to talk to you.

1360
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,269
If you'll wait just a minute,
I'll put her on.

1361
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,437
Uh-huh.

1362
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:44,648
Say, sugar, you got a match?

1363
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,025
Sure thing.

1364
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:49,570
VIVIAN: Hello, Marlowe.

1365
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,071
Hello?

1366
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:52,323
Thanks.

1367
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:54,158
Hello?

1368
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,619
Hello, Mrs. Rutledge.

1369
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:58,913
Hello, Marlowe. I wanted to tell you,

1370
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,332
you can stop worrying
and call off your bloodhounds.

1371
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:02,666
We've found Shawn.

1372
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,209
What's that? You've found Shawn?

1373
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:07,129
Yes, he's been in Mexico.
He hasn't been very well.

1374
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:08,589
Yeah? What happened?

1375
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,508
An accident of some kind.
We didn't get all the details.

1376
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:13,510
I'm leaving at once to meet him.

1377
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:14,845
Oh, I see.

1378
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,681
I suppose the General's quite pleased.

1379
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,601
We haven't told him yet.
We thought it best to wait.

1380
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:23,020
Well, thanks for telling me.

1381
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,396
Have a nice trip.

1382
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:26,273
I will. Goodbye.

1383
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,691
Goodbye.

1384
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,436
Say, mister, would you please...

1385
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,408
(GRUNTING)

1386
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:19,785
This is just our way of sayin' lay off!

1387
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:21,286
(GRUNTS)

1388
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:29,545
(MARLOWE GRUNTING)

1389
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:50,774
(GROANS)

1390
01:23:53,903 --> 01:23:55,946
You the guy that's been tailing me?

1391
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,615
Yeah. My name's Jones. Harry Jones.

1392
01:23:58,783 --> 01:23:59,950
I want to see you.

1393
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,160
That's swell.

1394
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:04,621
Did you want to see those guys jump me?

1395
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:06,623
I didn't care one way or the other.

1396
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,960
You could've yelled for help.

1397
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,129
A guy's playin' a hand, I let him play it.

1398
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:13,881
I'm no kibitzer.

1399
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,967
You got brains.

1400
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,802
Get my hat, will you?

1401
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,890
Help me up to my office.

1402
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:41,867
That working over they gave you

1403
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:44,244
was about the best I've ever seen,
and I've been around, too.

1404
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:45,621
Yeah.

1405
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:47,456
Used to run a little liquor.

1406
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:50,167
Rode the scout car
with a Tommy gun in my lap.

1407
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,336
- A tough racket.
- Terrible.

1408
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:54,421
Sit down. You make me nervous.

1409
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,590
Maybe you don't believe me.

1410
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,133
What do you want?

1411
01:24:58,301 --> 01:24:59,510
That's better.

1412
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,721
I've got something to sell, cheap,
for a couple of C's.

1413
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,473
Don't let me stop you.

1414
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:05,974
Don't you even want to know who I am?

1415
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,018
I already know.

1416
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,269
You're not a cop.

1417
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,772
You don't belong to Eddie Mars,
because I asked him.

1418
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,274
So you must be one of Brody's friends.

1419
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:16,401
So Agnes is loose again, huh?

1420
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:18,195
- How'd you know that?
- (CHUCKLES)

1421
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:21,448
She's a nice girl.
We're talking about getting married.

1422
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,200
She's too big for you.

1423
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,619
That's a dirty crack, brother.

1424
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,996
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

1425
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,252
Maybe I've been running around
with the wrong people.

1426
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:35,671
Let's cut the babble. What do you want?

1427
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,840
You're looking for something.
Will you pay for It?

1428
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:39,591
- If it does what?
- Helps you find Regan.

1429
01:25:41,052 --> 01:25:42,219
This is getting funny.

1430
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:45,848
I'm supposed to pay you two C's
for telling me I'm looking for Regan.

1431
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:47,975
People have been telling me that for days.

1432
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,893
I don't even pass out cigars anymore.

1433
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:52,187
Do you want to know what I've got,
or don't you?

1434
01:25:52,355 --> 01:25:53,564
I don't know.

1435
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:56,775
$200 buys a lot of information
in my circle.

1436
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:59,361
Would you pay it to know
where Eddie Mars' wife is?

1437
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:01,905
Would you pay 200 bucks for that, shamus?

1438
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:04,408
I think I might. Where?

1439
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:05,576
Agnes found her.

1440
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:09,246
She'll tell you.
When she has the dough in her hand.

1441
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:11,290
You might tell the cops for nothing.

1442
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:13,208
I ain't so brittle.

1443
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,127
Agnes must have something I didn't notice.

1444
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:17,421
I ain't tried to pull anything.

1445
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:20,340
I came here with a straight proposition.
Take it or leave it.

1446
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:22,259
One right guy to another.

1447
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,595
You start wavin' cops at me.

1448
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:25,929
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1449
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:27,598
I am.

1450
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:29,016
Okay. $200 it is.

1451
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,434
Have you got the money?

1452
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:31,602
Where's Agnes?

1453
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,937
You know Puss Walgreen's office,
Fulwider Building,

1454
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:35,856
428, in the back?

1455
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,566
No, but I can find it.

1456
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:39,526
Will you be in shape
to meet me there in an hour?

1457
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:40,736
Yeah, I guess so.

1458
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:42,446
You bring the dough,
and I'll take you to Agnes.

1459
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,865
- Okay.
- Okay.

1460
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:29,201
JONES: Who are you? What do you want?

1461
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:33,997
What did you follow me in here for?

1462
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,500
MAN: I wanted to see you.

1463
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:40,879
JONES: Who are you?

1464
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,840
MAN: I work for Eddie Mars.
My name is Canino.

1465
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:47,844
JONES: Canino? Yeah,
I've heard about you. Sure.

1466
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:49,763
CANINO: I thought you would remember.

1467
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:50,973
JONES: What do you want?

1468
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,725
CANINO: I want to know why you been
following that Detective Marlowe.

1469
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:55,060
JONES: Who says I've been?
CANINO: I do.

1470
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:57,020
That was a mistake, your mistake.

1471
01:27:57,188 --> 01:27:59,064
- Eddie Mars don't like it.
- JONES: I don't see what business...

1472
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,984
CANINO: Sit down and quit stallin'.
Why are you tailing Marlowe?

1473
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:04,778
JONES: All right, there's no harm tellin'.

1474
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,363
It was for Joe Brody's girl.

1475
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,699
She's got to get out of town.
That takes dough.

1476
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:09,950
She figured she could get it
through Marlowe.

1477
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,118
Why would he pay?

1478
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,413
You know about the night
the kid bumped Brody.

1479
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,873
Well, the young Sternwood girl was there.

1480
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,333
Only, Marlowe didn't tell the cops that.

1481
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,379
So Agnes figured it was railroad fare
as soon as she could get hold of him.

1482
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,298
- You get it?
- CANINO: Sure, I get it.

1483
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,341
- Where's this Agnes?
- JONES: What do you care?

1484
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,969
What do you want with her?
What's she got...

1485
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:31,555
What's the matter, Jones?
Ain't you ever seen a gun before?

1486
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:32,723
Where's the girl?

1487
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,057
- Listen...
- You want me to count

1488
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:36,018
three or somethin', like a movie?

1489
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:38,145
- Where's Agnes?
- All right.

1490
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:40,397
You win.

1491
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:44,234
She's in an apartment at 28 Court Street.

1492
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,571
Apartment 301.

1493
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:49,781
I guess I'm yellow, all right.

1494
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:52,367
You just got good sense.

1495
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:56,371
I ain't gonna hurt her.
Not if everything's like you say.

1496
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:57,748
You're nervous, ain't you?

1497
01:28:58,416 --> 01:28:59,958
- Maybe you need a drink.
- Never mind. Thanks...

1498
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:01,209
- I think you need one.
- I don't think so...

1499
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:02,502
You got a glass?

1500
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,296
Yeah.

1501
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,089
There at the water cooler.

1502
01:29:21,564 --> 01:29:24,066
There you are, pal. Drink her down.

1503
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:26,443
Well, drink it.

1504
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,945

I'll bet that Agnes of yours
wouldn't turn it down.

You got a girl living there

Well, have you got a brunette

- Why?

to keep you out of trouble.

There's no use going into that.
You don't really care, anyway.

Well, Joe and I were out
ridin' on Foothill Boulevard

1549
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:41,972
a couple of weeks ago.

1550
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:44,641
We passed a brown coupe,
and I saw the girl who was drivin'.

1551
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,309
She was Eddie Mars' wife.

1552
01:32:46,477 --> 01:32:47,769
There was a fellow with her, Canino.

1553
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:48,979
Yeah, I know him.

- Do you know where Realito is?
- Uh-huh.

1558
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:58,613
Well, about 10 miles east,
there's a side road.

1559
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:00,615

a two-bit garage and paint shop

And a frame house right behind it.

That's where Eddie Mars' wife is holed up.

- You're sure of that?
- Why should I lie?

Well, a little man named
Harry Jones told me.

A funny little guy, harmless. I liked him.

1641
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:40,163
He came to sell me the information

1642
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:43,166
because he found out
I was working for General Sternwood.

1643
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,169
How he found out's a long story.

Anyway, Canino, your husband's hired man,

1645
01:38:49,131 --> 01:38:51,257
got to him first
while I stood around like a sap.

1646
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,635
I was in the next room.

1647
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,345
Now that little man is dead.

- You're lying.

No. Eddie Mars never kills anybody.
He just hires it done.

I don't believe you.

1651
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:02,894
You think he's just a gambler, don't you?

1652
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,479
Well, I think he's a blackmailer...

He's anything that looks good to him.

01:39:08,567 --> 01:39:10,276
Anything with money pinned to it.
Anything rotten. He'd...

1657
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,322
Ask him when you see him.

1658
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:18,159
Well, I got rid of her.

1659
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:19,911
She's okay. I like her.

1660
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:22,288
You like too many people.

1661
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:24,916
Never mind, angel. The water feels good.

1662
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:28,419
I wonder if you'd do
what she did for a man.

1663
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:30,797
I was wondering that myself.

1664
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:34,926
Huh. Well, there's nothing to do
but wait for Canino to come back.

1665
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:37,261
He doesn't know I was in the other room.

1666
01:39:37,429 --> 01:39:39,514
You know what he'll do
when he finds out, don't you?

1667
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:40,807
He'll beat my teeth out

1668
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,934
and then kick me in the stomach
for mumbling.

1669
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:44,936
Well, that'll be just a start.
It won't be pretty to watch...

1670
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:46,729
Please don't talk like that.

1671
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:48,815
- You should have gone to Mexico.
- Stop, please.

1672
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:51,109
Then you couldn't have gone, could you?

1673
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:52,860
The border patrol would have
checked you through alone.

1674
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,446
Too many people would have
seen you without Regan.

1675
01:39:55,614 --> 01:39:56,781
It was much safer to come here with her.

1676
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:58,408
Much safer, especially for Eddie Mars.

1677
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:02,245
Will you get out of this
and stay out if I let you go?

No.

Ah, that's better.

I'm gonna leave you in a tough spot.

- That's all right with me.
- How do I get out of here?

1692

That door leads onto a side porch.

1693
01:41:21,366 --> 01:41:23,159
All right, as soon as I've gone,
you count to 20 slowly

1694

- and then scream your head off.
- I will.

We'll have to take his car.

How far is it from back there
to the nearest telephone?

1705
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:13,829
About eight or 10 miles to Realito. Why?

When Eddie Mars' wife gets my car fixed
and he finds out what happened,

1707

there'll be plenty of trouble.

- Why not?

I killed a man back there,

and I had to stand by
while a harmless little guy was killed.

- I asked you how it happened.

- He liked your wife.

01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:35,414
Eddie Mars. His boys got him.

1837
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:38,375
There's more to it than that.
He killed Regan.

1838
01:52:38,543 --> 01:52:41,253
- I'll tell you about it when I see you.
- Where are you?

1839
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:42,504
The same place, Laverne Terrace.

1840
01:52:42,672 --> 01:52:44,923
You'd better come up
and get me out of here.

1841
01:52:45,091 --> 01:52:47,509
And watch yourself.
They may still be outside.

1842
01:52:47,677 --> 01:52:49,011
Right away.

1843
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:58,312
It won't take him long.

1844
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,939
- What are you going to...
- Wait, let me do the talking, angel.

1845
01:53:01,816 --> 01:53:04,860
I don't know yet what I'm gonna tell him,
but it'll be pretty close to the truth.

1846
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:09,823
You'll have to send Carmen away,
from a lot of things.

1847
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:11,825
They have places for that.

1848
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:15,037
Maybe they can cure her.
It's been done before.

1849
01:53:16,498 --> 01:53:19,708
And we'll have to tell your father
about Regan, I think he can take it.

1850
01:53:20,668 --> 01:53:24,087
You've forgotten one thing, me.

1851
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:29,718
What's wrong with you?

1852
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,554
Nothing you can't fix.

1853
01:53:32,847 --> 01:53:34,890
(SIREN BLARING)

1854
