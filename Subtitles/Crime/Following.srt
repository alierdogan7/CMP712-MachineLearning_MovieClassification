- Well, what then?

644
01:00:54,324 --> 01:00:56,918
It was for a friend.

645
01:00:56,993 --> 01:00:59,655
The police think he did
something and he didn't.

646
01:00:59,729 --> 01:01:03,529
So he needs a decoy--
another likely suspect.

647
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,592
Someone caught robbing a place using
the same way he does it-- his methods.

His methods.

649

Broke into a place
a couple of weeks ago.

652
01:01:18,648 --> 01:01:20,912
He found an old lady
bashed to death.

653
01:01:20,984 --> 01:01:23,612
He ran off.
Someone saw him.

654
01:01:23,686 --> 01:01:28,020
Couple of days later the police
called him in for questioning.
They think he killed her.

655
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:31,424
- He probably did.
- He's a thief. He's not a murderer.

656
01:01:31,494 --> 01:01:36,022
So, he told them that, uh,
they've got him confused
with another burglar he knew.

657
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:39,865
- One who used the same M.O.
- Why me?

658
01:01:39,936 --> 01:01:42,871
You set yourself up
for it.

659
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:47,137
Cobb noticed you following him days
before he actually approached you.

660
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:50,441
Initially, he thought you were police.
And then he followed you.

661
01:01:50,513 --> 01:01:53,243
He followed me?

662
01:01:53,316 --> 01:01:58,652
He followed you and realized
you were just this sad, little
fucker waiting to be used.

663
01:01:58,721 --> 01:02:01,519
So you and Cobb
just went for it.

How could you
do this to me?

To anybody?

It's not that serious.

You've got the money,
you didn't kill the old lady.

668
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:15,900
You're just there to throw
doubt into the minds of the police.

669
01:02:15,972 --> 01:02:18,202
They'll never charge you.

670
01:02:18,274 --> 01:02:20,708
You were supposed to get
caught tonight breaking in.

671
01:02:20,777 --> 01:02:23,746
They'd pull you in, ask you about the
old lady and you wouldn't know anything.

672
01:02:23,813 --> 01:02:26,441
They still could have
charged me for breaking and entering.

673
01:02:26,516 --> 01:02:31,476
You did break and enter.
And for whatever reason,
you didn't get caught red-handed.

674
01:02:34,757 --> 01:02:37,555
He came in.
He went down.

675
01:02:37,627 --> 01:02:41,427
I didn't hang around long enough
to find out whether he could get up.

676
01:02:41,497 --> 01:02:44,364
It's his blood
on my hammer.

How could you
do this to me?

678

You can't, 'cause
they won't believe you.

I'm gonna tell them everything. They'll
believe me because it's the truth.

to back up your story.

I won't.

he'd look in the envelope.

You've become too greedy
in your blackmail.

One type, I assume, will match
