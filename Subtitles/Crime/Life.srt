Why ain't that

Why ain't that

Why ain't that
pick swinging, nigger?

678

It's too hot.
I'm tired, boss.

He said he's too hot, boss.
He's tired.

Too hot?
He's tired?

He don't sound like
he from around here.

He from New York City, boss.
That one there, too.

They'll find we do things
different down here.

Looks like we got
a couple of live ones.

701
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,460
How long these boys in for?

702
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,092
The judge gave them
the long ride, boss.

703
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,014
Life, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

704

Why?

712
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,080
I've been carrying this
letter for four months now.

713
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,340
You mean to tell me,
none of y'all can read?

714
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,045
Last fella what could read made
parole, what, around Christmas.

719
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,564
Here. Look, it's from your
mama's neighbor, Mrs. Tadwell.

720
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:27,690
You know who
that is, Mrs. Tadwell?

721
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,864
She thought you ought to know
that your second cousin Bo died.

722
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:35,035
Bo died. And your other cousin,
Sally, on your daddy's side,

723
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,157
she died.

724
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,538
And apparently
your sister died, too.

725
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,739

726
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,371
No, it say Marleen here.

733
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,138
in which your mama and your
daddy were both killed.

734
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,520
Well, don't worry, 'cause she
gonna take care of the dog.
