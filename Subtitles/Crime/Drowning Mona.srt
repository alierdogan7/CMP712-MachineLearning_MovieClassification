1
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,018
Shit.

2
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,169
I see.

3
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,009
Is that right?

4
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,411
Well, have you ever
seen Starlight Express?

5
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,885
- Daddy, of course I have.
- Well, face it. It's no West Side Story.

6
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,353
You don't know what kind it was?

7
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,413
It was a mix.

8
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,119
There's English.
There's Rednose.

9
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,061
There's Staffordshire.
There's all kinds. There's American...

10
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,257
That's what she says:
"It was a longhaired pit bull."

11
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,732
- There's no such thing.
- That's what I'm sayin'.

12
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,099
- It's an obvious discrepancy.
- One of you guys gonna get that?

13
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,901
I'm not attacking him...
just working this out.

14
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,375
Carlucci. One second.

15
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,844
Feege, you got a call on two.

16
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,314
We okay here? Because this is just...
It's formality.

17
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,944
- I might have to do it all over.
- Lieutenant Gruman speaking.

18
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,885
" Lieutenant"?

19
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,994
How can you say that?
Rita Moreno was fabulous.

20
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,232
- At least she wasn't on roller skates.
- Makin'fun of me 'cause I like Xanadu?

21
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,770
- What?
- Lucinda just called.

22
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,306
Let me call you back.

23
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,505
- You know Mona Dearly?
- What about her?

24
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,514
She was proceeding southbound
on Route 9...

25
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:14,610
when apparently her vehicle was involved
in a 2-11-07.

26
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,583
- What?
- She drove into the river.

27
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,861
She's dead, Wyatt.

28
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,076
So what happened to your hand?

29
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,518
This thing? It's nothing.
What are you gonna do?

30
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,489
- So what'd you say your name was again?
- Maria Lasala.

31
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,049
- That's a nice name.
- Thanks.

32
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:32,095
- So are you married or something?
- Maybe.

33
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,271
- She's 13, man.
- Yeah. Finally.

34
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,614
- I'm picking you up tomorrow at 9:00.
- For what?

35
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,548
- What do you mean, " For what?" For work.
- 9:00?

36
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,618
- That's early.
- But it's Carlsson's.

37
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,562
- So?
- It's Carlsson's Nursery.

38
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,225
I heard you the first time, Bobby.
I ain't mute.

39
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,895
I'm just saying, Carlsson's Nursery
is gonna make us a lot of money.

40
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,632
I mean,
it's gonna save the business.

41
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,901
I get half.

42
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,670
I know.

43
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,645
And none of that "50%" bullshit.

44
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,065
That's it!

45
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:06,120
What do you think? Should I do the
Yellow Apple Six report or Apple Seven?

46
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,862
- What's the difference?
- The Yellow Apple Six involves water.

47
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,059
Feege, the car
is submerged in water.

48
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,159
What do you think?

49
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,330
- Let's go with Yellow Apple Six.
- Yeah.

50
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,499
I think that's a good idea, Feege.

51
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,838
She's dead.

52
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,505
Thank you, Dr. Schwartz.

53
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,964
There he is. Here they come.

54
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,739
So...

55
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,240
you wanna tellJeff about his mom,
or do you think we should do it, or...

56
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,007
Yeah.

57
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,206
That's...

58
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,511
We'd be more than happy
to do it, Phil.

59
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,954
It's just that coming from you,
it may cushion the blow.

60
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,490
Being that
he's your son and all.

61
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,492
Well, in that case,
it might be best if one of you did it.

62
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,765
Right.

63
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,202
- We could do that.
- Do you wanna? I could do it.

64
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,865
- Are you... I could do it.
- Who's gonna do it?

65
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,743
- Jimmy's gonna do it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll handle it.

66
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,903
I got it.

67
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:40,177
Hey, Jeff. I'm afraid I got
some bad news. How you doin', Bobby?

68
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:44,349
- Where's my car?
- It's more serious than your car, Jeff.

69
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,256
Would somebody mind tellin' me
what the hell's goin' on here?

70
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,797
It's... I'm afraid...

71
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,566
Your mother was in a car accident.
I'm afraid she's dead, Jeff. She's dead.

72
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,340
What was she doin' in my car?

73
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:31,231
Where you been? Oh, you gotta talk
to Mark. We were goin' over the menu...

74
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,898
and I mentioned the boneless breast
of chicken, and he's, like, " Boneless?

75
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,998
You never said you wanted boneless."
Can you believe that?

76
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,475
I'm, like, "You don't serve
chicken bones at a wedding."

77
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,774
God forbid someone chokes to death.

78
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,110
It'll cost an extra five bucks a plate,
and at a hundred plates we're lookin'...

79
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,844
at half a grand, $500,
just to get rid of the bones.

80
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,351
Like we got that.

81
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,681
What's wrong?

82
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,117
Mona Dearly's dead.

83
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:58,127
What? You're kiddin' me.

84
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,859
No. I mean, yeah. I mean, no.

85
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,197
No, she's dead.

86
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,328
My God. What happened?

87
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,837
It was just a car accident
on the road, I guess.

88
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:17,278
Well, we gotta celebrate.

89
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,182
What? God, Ellie. Jesus.

90
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,189
She's a human being.
"We gotta celebrate." Have some respect.

91
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,452
I don't gotta have respect
for no one in that family.

92
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,128
Bobby, think about
how they've treated you.

93
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,461
- How they'd treat me?
- Badly. They're horrible people.

94
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,557
They're a houseful of freaks.

95
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,729
Hey, Philibuster,
check out how fast I'm doin' this.

96
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,734
- Cut it out, would you?
- No, I'm on a roll. Look at it.

97
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,371
Cut it out, you little shit,
or I'll kill ya!

98
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,972
All right.

99
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,745
Geez.

100
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,810
Now, about the name
of this business.

101
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,549
You given any thought
to it yet?

102
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,753
Well, I thought
we should call it " B.J. Landscapin'."

103
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,570
" B.J."?

104
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,441
- I don't get it.
- You know.

105
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,910
" B" for Bobby and "J" forJeff.
" B.J. Landscapin'."

106
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,779
Well, I think "J.B."
has a nicer ring to it.

107
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:29,719
Besides, you don't want anyone calling
you " Blow Job Landscaping," do you?

108
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,227
Well, then, what if
we call it "J.P. 's," right? That's good.

109
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,162
- "J.P. 's" ain't an option, Jeff.
- How come, smarty two-shoes?

110
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,859
'Cause his name
don't start with " P."

111
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,139
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus.

112
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,473
- What's that, Mr. Dearly?
- You say something, Phil?

113
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:55,105
- You gonna contribute or what?
- Yeah, what do you think?

114
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,314
I think that it's...

115
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,456
Whatever you two decide is...

116
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,282
All right. Thanks, Mr. Dearly.

117
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,293
For what?
He didn't say jack!

118
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,626
- Why you kissin' his ass?
- I wasn't kissin' his ass.

119
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,963
I thought you were done kissin' ass.
He was totally kissin' ass.

120
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,129
- Kiss-ass!
- Look at the little kiss-ass!

121
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,765
- You disgust me, you little kiss-ass.
- Little kiss-ass.

122
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,503
Get out of my sight.

123
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:33,615
She deserved it. I bet property values
go up. So, you gonna fireJeff?

124
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,587
What? No. Why would
I want to fireJeff?

125
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,680
'Cause you been wantin' to
for years.

126
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,091
No, I haven't. I stopped wanting
to fire him a long time ago.

127
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,829
Well, what about him
killin' the Schneider dog?

128
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,460
He didn't kill the Schneider dog. That
was an accident when he killed the dog.

129
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,004
Bobby, he ran over it
with a lawn mower.

130
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,372
Yeah.

131
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:01,279
I don't want to talk about it right now.
The guy's mother just drove off a cliff.

132
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,839
Yeah. Too bad Jeff
wasn't ridin' shotgun.

133
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,824
That would've been funny.

134
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,685
Ever so gracefully...

135
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,561
the yellow Hugo...
sort of foating...

136
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,898
It was almost slow motion-like.

137
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,130
And it did a swan dive
right into the river.

138
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,402
- A swan dive, huh?
- It was tragic and frightening...

139
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,444
yet beautiful
in an obtuse way.

140
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,339
- What'd he say?
- Clarence?

141
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,578
He said she drove into the river.

142
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,147
You know, Feege,
I was looking around up top...

143
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,658
and there was something
very odd about this.

144
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:51,093
- What's that?
- There are no skid marks.

145
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,755
She never hit the brakes.

146
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,598
We should do some checking to see if she
suffered from any medical conditions...

147
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,103
like narcolepsy or something.

148
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,332
Could've been " Barstein" syndrome.

149
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,941
Yeah.

150
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,878
Rash, she was a lousy driver.
It probably caught up with her.

151
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,509
- You knew her pretty well, didn't you?
- Our paths crossed time to time.

152
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,884
Juliet, Echo, Papa, Hotel.

153
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:20,415
You had that little thing with her
a while back? A bit of an altercation?

154
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,028
Let me see your hands!

155
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,327
Let me see your hands!

156
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,425
- Why'd you pull us over, Feege?
- Let me think about that for a second.

157
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:35,337
A: You're riding on rims. And B: Just
went 2,800 on an officer of the law.

158
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:39,104
And C: What the hell's
the matter with you, Jeff? Oh, boy!

159
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,278
Look what you did!

160
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,440
- I didn't do nothin'!
- You scared him half to death!

161
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,914
- He's drunk!
- No, he ain't!

162
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,315
Get out of here, ya jerk!

163
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,550
That's okay, baby.
Everything's okay. Mommy's here now.

164
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,252
Yes. Okay, baby.

165
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,453
You're gonna pay for this, Feege.

166
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,326
You just lost a lawn service, pal!

167
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,935
It's a real shame, though. Him and Bobby
did a fabulous job on my place.

168
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,736
So what do you think, Lucinda?

169
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:12,971
What do I think? I think she took a turn
for the worse and broke her stupid neck.

170
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,945
A fitting end
to a less than laudable life.

171
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,948
I'm talkin' about the car.

172
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,179
- I'll have her fixed in no time.
- Lucinda.

173
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:24,188
Look, dude,
if somebody rigged it, you'll know.

174
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,692
- I'm countin' on you, all right?
- All right. It'll cost you.

175
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,453
- You gonna charge him double?
- You know it.

176
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,730
- She's dead.
- I know.

177
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,667
I can't believe this.

178
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:22,002
I mean, it's just...
Man, I mean...

179
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:28,604
This is it, right, Rone?
I mean, this is it. I'm...

180
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,275
- I don't like it, Phil, one bit.
- What's the matter?

181
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,819
I have to ask you something,
and I want you to be honest.

182
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,320
Sure.

183
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,083
- What?
- Did you do it?

184
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,719
- Did I do what?
- Did you kill her?

185
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,359
- How could you ask me that?
- It looks suspicious, Phil.

186
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,992
It was an accident.
It was a stroke of good luck.

187
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,832
Good luck doesn't happen to people
like us. Good luck happens to Madonna.

188
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:57,103
Tony and Jimmy D said it could've
been slippage on the road or something.

189
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,110
- I don't know.
- Sure.

190
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,246
Couple of months, they're gonna find me
foatin' at the bottom of the Hudson.

191
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,810
Don't talk like that, baby.
Don't talk like that.

192
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,854
'Cause if you're down there,
I'm down there.

193
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,314
I'll go down with the catfish.

194
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,155
I'll go swim in the murk.

195
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,187
- Phil?
- Yeah.

196
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,322
- Are you okay?
- I'll live.

197
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,104
No bacteria. Honest.

198
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:36,944
I am a priest. A priest.
You can't cut me off.

199
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,883
Padre, stow it. You're breakin'
my concentration, for cryin' out loud.

200
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,480
Threats notwithstanding, cut the sermon
and give me a goddamn beer!

201
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,354
What? You want me to squirt you in front
of God and everybody here? I'll do it.

202
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,495
Murph, what's all this
about the chicken?

203
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:55,727
The chickens? We got bigger fish to fry.
Get your ass over there. Come on.

204
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,167
- Tell me you didn't do it, Bobby.
- Do what?

205
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,540
What do you mean?

206
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,745
Come on. They were
killing your business, Bobby.

207
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,981
That whole family
was ruining your life.

208
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,114
No, they weren't.
They weren't ruining anything.

209
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,557
I didn't do it. Are you crazy?
What are you talking about?

210
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,460
I'm just sayin' there's a lot of people
that wouldn't blame you if you did.

211
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,055
- Come on, Murph. Jesus Christ.
- All right.

212
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,329
I'm just doin' the big brother thing,
you know?

213
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,336
I'm just... I'll back off.

214
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,338
Guess who got
in an altercation last night.

215
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,777
- Who?
- Valerie Antonelli.

216
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,338
- Big talk! Big talk from the big man!
- You talkin' to me?

217
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,247
Where's Bobby Calzone
when you need him?

218
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,149
What are you gonna do, hit me?

219
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,426
Come on, Murph. She's a girl. You don't
let her get slapped around like that.

220
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,591
- What's the matter with you?
- She wanted to be a landscaper.

221
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,394
Sue me.

222
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,635
All right. Listen, Murph,
what's up with the whole chicken thing?

223
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,476
- You gonna help us out?
- Look, if you want somebody to sit...

224
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,108
and yank the bones out of a hundred
chickens, it's gonna run you money.

225
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,652
You know, you're the best man
at the wedding, Murph.

226
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,154
I'm not making any money
on this weddin' as it is.

227
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:29,490
You're my brother. Can't you do
a brotherly deboning or something?

228
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,358
Okay.

229
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,662
How long is this gonna go on?
I'm frontin' ya for your business.

230
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:40,797
I'm helping with your weddin'. Last year
I declared you a dependent on my taxes.

231
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:46,777
I'm havin' a hard time at work,
and I'm a little shorthanded with Jeff.

232
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,109
Well, maybe due
to the untimely demise of Mona Dearly...

233
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,414
you can finally get rid of that
one-armed bandit partner of yours.

234
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:06,363
Bobby, come on.
I can't let you carry me like this.

235
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,292
Wait a second.
I have to close the door.

236
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,395
I'm not ready.

237
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,372
You're no fun at all.

238
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,238
You have one new message.

239
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,437
Hi, honey.
It's your old dad callin'.

240
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,948
Just wanted to see how plans
for the big day are shapin'up.

241
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,884
I thought we could hop over
to the diner for some breakfast.

242
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,786
Tomorrow's no good,
but maybe Saturday. Okay?

243
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,256
Say "hey"to Bobby.
Be good.

244
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,795
- What do you think he wants?
- I don't know.

245
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,822
Sounded pretty cryptic.
Something about breakfast, Saturday.

246
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,834
Hard to say.

247
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,242
What's wrong?

248
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,179
Nothin'.

249
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,295
Up a lazy river
with a robin's song

250
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,888
Awaits the bright new morning

251
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,900
We can loaf along

252
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,472
I just thought I'd stop by
and pay my respects.

253
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,882
- Your dad's not home, is he?
- No.

254
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:39,023
I know this is trying times
for the two of you.

255
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,283
- You want a beer or something?
- No, thanks.

256
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,422
You don't happen to know where he went?

257
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,970
Did your mother suffer from any
medical conditions you might know of?

258
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,971
I think she had
a personality disorder.

259
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,776
No, not necessarily
like that. It's...

260
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,283
It's just there are some aspects
to this accident that...

261
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,114
You think someone killed her?

262
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,223
- Well, I didn't do it.
- I never said you did.

263
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,988
But if you were to know if somebody
had a grudge against her...

264
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,257
or something like that,
you know.

265
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:23,563
Yeah. I don't wanna point any fingers
and whatnot, but Bobby Calzone did it.

266
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:30,901
I find that hard to believe. He
doesn't have a violent bone in his body.

267
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,944
Why don't you see how Peaches
feels about that?

268
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,640
Peaches? The Schneider dog?

269
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,149
Yeah. With the lawn mower.

270
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:42,015
- Great job with Peaches, there, Bobby.
- Drop dead, asshole.

271
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,419
" But, Bobby,
that poor little dog."

272
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,423
" Poor little dog."
It was in the way.

273
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,982
You were the one chasin' after it
with the lawn mower, not me.

274
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,789
It wasn't my fault.

275
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,854
- It got in the way.
- Now we lost that account.

276
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,196
Blame me. Blame me
like you blame me for everything else.

277
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,099
- I don't care.
- You killed Peaches.

278
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,402
- I would've fired us for that.
- Like you never killed a dog?

279
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,272
If you keep losin' our accounts,
pretty soon we'll be out of business.

280
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,903
- Then how you gonna take care of Ellen?
- "Take care of Ellen."

281
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,675
- Ellen freakin' schmellen.
- Honey, I hate to see you guys...

282
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,979
What are you saying?
I can't hear you, Mrs. Dearly.

283
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,519
- What?
- You're hurting me!

284
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:19,523
Shut up! One step closer, Jeff, and
I swear I'll tear out your ovaries!

285
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:24,085
- Don't you talk to my boy like that.
- Your boy has the IQ of a garden pest!

286
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,153
And so do you,
you dumb wench!

287
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,893
- Bobby, I don't think...
- What? You don't think?

288
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,798
That's your problem!
You don't think!

289
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,736
You don't think!
I've had it!

290
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,831
I can't take it anymore!
Especially you, Mona Dearly!

291
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,842
What's that supposed to mean?

292
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,401
You know what it means!
You know what it means!

293
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,481
He said "ovaries"?

294
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:54,184
- Yeah, all the time.
- And he threatened your mom's life?

295
00:24:56,094 --> 00:25:00,053
- Why didn't you report this?
- 'Cause everyone threatened her life.

296
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,267
"Ovaries."

297
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:15,504
She took a turn for the worse

298
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,743
You know
she swam with the fishes

299
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:22,344
You know
she dug in the dirt

300
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,890
Why did she have to die, die

301
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,394
Why did she have to die, die

302
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,864
Catchy.

303
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:44,874
That was nice.

304
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,934
Thanks.
How's that daughter of yours?

305
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,345
- She's great. Thanks for asking.
- Yeah? Wedding plans going smooth?

306
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:54,044
- Like silk on glass.
- I want you to take a look under here.

307
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,246
If somebody were
to sabotage the brakes...

308
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,755
- "lf'?
- "lf." It's a conditional clause.

309
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,188
"lf."

310
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:04,354
If somebody were to sabotage the brakes,
he's got two options.

311
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,456
He can be smart and puncture a hole
in the brake fuid tank...

312
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:12,993
or he can be a total freak
and cut all four of the brake lines.

313
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,234
I'll show you.
These here are the brake lines.

314
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,072
- They've all been cut.
- Total freak.

315
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,977
- That rules out accident...
- Slow down, pal.

316
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,242
We're just gettin' started here.

317
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,750
All right. Now...

318
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,251
know what this is?

319
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,688
- I don't know shit about cars.
- That's the brake fuid tank.

320
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,249
- What's that hole?
- It's a hole.

321
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,762
So I figure the perp...

322
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,821
used some kind of sharp instrument...

323
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,367
a screwdriver, an awl,
what have you...

324
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,029
took it, drove it through the tank
with a hammer.

325
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,800
Just, bam! See this?

326
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,171
This here?
Fetzer valve.

327
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:55,042
- I'm not familiar with the fetzer.
- Nor should you be. Serves no purpose.

328
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:59,044
- So what's the problem?
- Somebody poked a hole in that too.

329
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,779
- Is that bad?
- This car was done to death.

330
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,980
- " Done to death"?
- Fixed to kill.

331
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,554
" Fixed to kill."

332
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,559
This was no accident.

333
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,432
"Sorry to bother you.

334
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,801
I just wanted to express my sorrow
over the loss of your tragic..."

335
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:24,330
" Hi, Jeff and Phil.
I'm really sorry to bother you."

336
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,070
" Hi. Sorry to bother you.

337
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:32,207
Listen, I just wanted to
express my sorrow over the loss of..."

338
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,479
Mr. Dearly.

339
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:41,185
I just wanted to express my sorrow
over the loss of your tragic loved one.

340
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,758
My loved one?

341
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,092
- Your wife passed.
- Yeah? Who'd she pass?

342
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,895
What do you want?

343
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,631
Bobby came by to express his loss
over our sorry loved one.

344
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:56,674
- Yeah, I ain't workin' today.
- No, you shouldn't work.

345
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,676
You're definitely
on a grievance leave...

346
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,679
and I'm just coming by
to say that I'm really sorry.

347
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,681
That's great,
if that's what you wanna tell yourself.

348
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,240
If you ask me,
he sounds real broken up about it.

349
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,411
- I mean, look at him.
- Yeah, no kiddin'.

350
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,614
- All right. So...
- Listen, Bobby.

351
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,023
If you're tormented by this, you should
come by Cubby's Funeral Home tonight...

352
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,583
and have a full release.

353
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,391
Yeah. We're havin' one of them
"wake and bake" services.

354
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,591
Yeah. Sure.
I'll come by Cubby's.

355
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,429
You do that, you little kiss-ass.

356
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,901
Yeah. Make sure
you wear them kiss-ass shoes too.

357
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,564
And that landscapin'
kiss-ass T-shirt.

358
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,268
"I'll mow your lawn, I'll trim
your hedges and I'll kiss your ass!"

359
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,637
- There he goes. Look at that.
- Yeah.

360
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,945
Little hesitation before the kiss.
Careful. Don't kiss the dog's ass.

361
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,487
All he talks about
is how much the wedding's gonna cost...

362
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,220
and how Jeff s ruining J.B. 's.

363
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,489
I'm worried about him, Dad.
It's like he's obsessed.

364
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,763
Well, I'll talk to him,
see if I can help.

365
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,631
No. That's all right.
You've already done enough.

366
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:01,263
You know, this is gonna sound terrible,
but with Mrs. Dearly dyin'...

367
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:04,274
this is the first break
he's caught in a while.

368
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,276
Okay, folks.

369
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:13,008
Shame about Mona Dearly, huh?
I mean, so young. Tragic.

370
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,111
- It's taken everybody by surprise.
- Yeah. Poor family.

371
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,180
- So, what can I get ya?
- I'll have the usual and a cup of joe.

372
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,819
And you, hon? You want the heart attack
special, just like your daddy?

373
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,795
The vegetarian plate.

374
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,264
Back in a jiff.

375
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:33,301
A box of friggin' meat for my wedding.
Like I'm registered at a deli.

376
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,965
What do you think about "Ice Castles"
for a spotlight dance?

377
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,935
- You can't go wrong with "Ice Castles."
- That's what I was thinking.

378
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,184
It looks like there's going
to be an investigation into this thing.

379
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:51,120
I have to tell you that this wedding
of yours is all anybody's talking about.

380
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:55,990
And the fact you two even considered
having me there... Well, forget about it.

381
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,654
Yeah, well, me and Bobby
really want you there, Rone.

382
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:03,064
Well, I just want you to know
it moved me, down deep.

383
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,898
- Really. It moved me.
- Good.

384
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,530
Enjoy your meal.

385
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,407
- So where was I?
- You said you were gonna investigate.

386
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,914
Right.

387
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,473
- What I was thinkin' was...
- Goddamn it.

388
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,713
Don't give me that shit, Phil.

389
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:26,348
I am not overreacting. He was there.
He was talkin' to Ellen.

390
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,757
- Come on, sweet nipple.
- Don't "sweet nipple"me, Phil.

391
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,763
But we got nothing to do with it, honey.
I'm dumpin' her stuff right now.

392
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,594
What does that
have to do with anything?

393
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,497
Do you know why our prisons
are so overcrowded?

394
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,901
- I don't know. Too many criminals?
- Wrongful imprisonment, Phil.

395
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:44,772
Erroneous convictions. Eleven percent
of all inmates currently serving time...

396
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,108
are counterfactually incarcerated
for crimes uncommitted.

397
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,738
Did you ever see Tom Selleck
in An Innocent Man?

398
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,045
- Yeah. Was that with Kurt Russell?
- Phil, look.

399
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,017
Rash is askin' a lot of questions
about all of you...

400
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,111
and I don't like one bit what
he's insinuating, not one bit.

401
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,917
Relax, Vanna.

402
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,790
He's just doin' his...
Oh, shit.

403
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,994
- Rash is here.
- What?

404
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,655
I gotta go.

405
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,865
- Hey, Chief.
- Hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.

406
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,204
I was just gettin' ready
for Mona's wake. How you doin'?

407
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,311
I'm fine.

408
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,540
That's a really nice picture
of the two of you.

409
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,848
I can't tell you
how sorry I am about Mona.

410
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,382
She was a passionate
and committed woman.

411
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,929
This is probably
the exact wrong time to ask you...

412
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:47,160
Whatever I can do to help.
I mean, you know me. I'm a team player.

413
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,230
I need to ask you a couple of questions
about your wife.

414
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,136
Yeah? What about her?

415
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,914
Phil, sweetie,
you got a minute for me?

416
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,177
Honey, they're lookin'
for the shooter.

417
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,950
Get in here, Phil.

418
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,958
You should've seen this guy,
taking potshots in his skivvies.

419
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,687
He looked like Father Tom.

420
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,166
- Yes, dear?
- Where were you this afternoon?

421
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,670
- But...
- Where the hell were ya?

422
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,137
I called the warehouse.
You were MIA.

423
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,969
You sure
you had the right number?

424
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,207
- Oh, boy.
- Who is she, Phil?

425
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,712
- Who's who?
- What's her name?

426
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,547
Sweetness. Oh, Jesus, honey,
you could hurt somebody with that.

427
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,553
I don't wanna hurt someone, Phil.
I wanna hurt you!

428
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,715
- What's gotten into you?
- You.

429
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,726
- You don't find me attractive no more?
- Of course I don't... do.

430
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,892
You got something goin' on,
don't you, Phil? Don't you?

431
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,297
You've been playing Wheel of Fortune
with someone else.

432
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,630
Don't tell anyone, but...

433
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,906
I was a battered husband.

434
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,239
Phil, that was the Wednesday night
prior to the accident?

435
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,376
That's right.

436
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,149
And at no point during the evening
did you leave the house?

437
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:14,385
No, I was watching TV
the entire evening.

438
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,825
What aboutJeff?

439
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,522
Well, him and Mona
had a fight earlier that night.

440
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,933
- Do you recall what was said?
- Yeah.

441
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,937
He said she was an embarrassment
to the family and then took off.

442
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:33,038
The kid was lit up like a Christmas
tree. I've never seen him so drunk.

443
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,202
Yeah. Yes.

444
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,171
I was talkin' to Ellen earlier.

445
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:15,743
She told me
you were worried about finances.

446
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:22,425
And I just... You know, you and I
are practically family now...

447
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:27,726
and, you know, you shouldn't
have to bear that burden alone.

448
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:32,065
If ever you wanna talk
or get something off your chest...

449
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,831
I appreciate that.

450
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,534
Just imagine that you're Annie
and I'm Daddy Warbucks.

451
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,269
- Daddy Warbucks.
- Yeah.

452
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:43,837
Or I'm Auntie Mame,
and you're little Patrick.

453
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,348
Yeah?

454
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,018
Well, tell me something, Bob.

455
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,116
What did you think
about Mona Dearly?

456
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:05,867
She was the worst person
I ever knew in my entire life.

457
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,131
How you doing?

458
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,837
- I just came to giveJeff his pay.
- How come you're all dolled up?

459
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,207
- I'm taking Ellie to dinner theater.
- Come on.

460
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,143
- What you gonna see?
- Oh, Calcutta.

461
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,739
Get over here. Give me my money.

462
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,681
Look at this guy.

463
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,982
What is this? You trying to tell me
it's what I've been bustin' my anus for?

464
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,524
For 287.50?

465
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,292
- It's always 287.50.
- He's tryin' to rip me off.

466
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,297
- You holdin' out on us, Calzone?
- Where's the rest of it, you dick?

467
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,356
- Looks to me like he's wearin' it.
- Yeah.

468
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:37,731
Nice shoes.

469
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,705
- This is a joke, right?
- No, you're a joke.

470
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,535
- You guys are kidding, right?
- Kidding?

471
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,576
You feel like laughing?
Laugh at this.

472
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,479
- Kick his ass, Mom, yeah! Get in there.
- You're payin' for that headlight!

473
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,781
- What are you doing? Get out of there.
- Take it out ofJeffrey's pay!

474
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,411
Yeah.

475
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,581
Get out of there.
What are you doin'?

476
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,184
- Let go!
- God! I mean, enough's enough.

477
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:07,220
All I wanted was a nice, professional
business so Ellie and I could have...

478
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,562
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what this is?

479
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,364
This is the world's
smallest tambourine.

480
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:16,668
- And it's playin' some song.
- Shut up! That's a violin.

481
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,834
Give me that thing.
Give me that.

482
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,243
I think it's time we start talkin'
about dissolvin' the business.

483
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,941
- Nothing personal. It's business.
- No way.

484
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,109
- Don't even think about it, scumbag.
- Yeah.

485
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,948
As I see it, you got two options:

486
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:34,253
- Buy us out or pray for an early death.
- Yeah, get out of here, you mooch.

487
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,555
Go enjoy your dinner theater.

488
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,987
But, you know,
she probably had her good points too.

489
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,002
Well, most people
have two sides.

490
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,373
Yeah, well,
she just showed me the one.

491
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,410
- ThatJeff Dearly, man.
- What about him?

492
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,748
You gotta hand it to him.

493
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:07,417
Jeff, what's your handle?

494
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,660
- Jeff, hands up.
- What's your handle?

495
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,159
Speaking of which,
guess what I heard.

496
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,013
- That's not a logging accident.
- What's the difference?

497
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,516
Why? What'd you hear?

498
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,829
What about that fishing accident?

499
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,644
- Are you serious?
- See?

500
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,119
Wow.

501
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,828
"It's a terrible loss."

502
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,923
"It's a terrible loss."

503
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,997
What a void in my life

504
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,804
All right.

505
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:39,642
" Father Tom,
it has been difficult."

506
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,785
" Father Tom,
it has been difficult."

507
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,153
"It's been really hard."

508
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,988
Jeff, come on.
We don't wanna miss this.

509
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,223
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Right.

510
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,402
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

511
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:43,205
- What did your dad wanna see you about?
- Nothing.

512
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,646
He just asked me some questions
about Mrs. Dearly.

513
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,480
What about her?
What kind of questions?

514
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,453
- About the accident.
- What does he think?

515
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,114
He doesn't think anything.

516
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,159
Really? I mean, you'd tell me, right,
if he said something?

517
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,061
For chrissakes, Bobby!

518
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,536
All right. I'm sorry.
I don't...

519
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,233
I don't care.
I don't know why I'm asking.

520
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,639
With Jeff not at work,
I'm shorthanded. L...

521
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,106
I'm just really tired.

522
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:22,842
- What did you want to talk to me about?
- Forget about it.

523
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,355
Do you imagine the Dearlys
were like us when they were our age?

524
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,698
No. She was always fat.

525
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,478
What time is it?

526
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,553
- 8:30.
- Jesus. I'm dyin' over here.

527
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,563
Keep in mind
we're remembering a lifetime.

528
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,895
Yeah. All right.
Ten more minutes, then.

529
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,502
To hell with it.
Let's go.

530
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,505
Hey, Cubby.

531
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,984
Me and Jeff don't think there's
much point hangin' out, you know.

532
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,982
In my experience...

533
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,995
wakes aren't very well attended.

534
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:43,762
I've found that oftentimes
the tragedy is so recent...

535
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:48,396
that loved ones are,
in effect, paralyzed...

536
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,769
by their grief.

537
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,939
Listen.
Who are we kiddin', huh?

538
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,672
No one's gonna come,
not with the game on.

539
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:59,113
Oh, shit.
I got money on that game.

540
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,151
Yeah. You and everyone's mother.

541
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,552
- I thought you were comin' by.
- Yeah.

542
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,392
You know, yeah.

543
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,968
You know,
I can't say your mom was good people...

544
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,266
- Are those pies fresh?
- No.

545
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,968
- Shame about Mona.
- Yeah, well, you snooze, you lose.

546
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,603
Hey, guys. How you doin'?
All right?

547
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,045
- Can we sit down already?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take that booth.

548
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:35,710
Thanks, babe.

549
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,417
What?

550
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,801
- Good evening, friends.
- Jesus, Cubby!

551
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,840
You've got...

552
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,302
You've got nice pictures
in here.

553
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,938
- I appreciate that. Thank you.
- Yeah.

554
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,744
- Where is everyone?
- Jeff and Phil are at the Palace...

555
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:10,583
getting some grub, but if you care
to look at the deceased...

556
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,087
Sure.

557
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,894
- Wow.
- Yeah.

558
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:22,592
- She looks so peaceful.
- In death, one finds serenity.

559
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,691
I guess.

560
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,061
Beautiful.

561
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:55,120
Dynamite stuff.
That's fantastic.

562
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,069
- Some turnout.
- Yeah.

563
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,738
So who showed up?

564
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,719
Bobby and Ellen
stopped by about an hour ago.

565
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:21,246
Otherwise,
it's just been me and my dinner date.

566
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,062
Tell me something, Cubby.
You notice anything odd lately?

567
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:30,430
Other than the fact that no one
seems to care about this woman's death?

568
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,901
- Along those lines.
- Hell, Wyatt...

569
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,531
I've seen people more upset
over losing change in a candy machine.

570
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,536
Who says you can't catch nothin'
in the river?

571
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,719
Feege is right.
We should show a little respect.

572
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:53,450
Jeff, why don't you say a word?

573
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:59,429
- Jeff, why don't you say a word?
- About what?

574
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,657
About your mother.

575
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:07,763
To Mom. Yeah, she was kind of mean,
but she was still my mom.

576
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,931
Someone had to be.

577
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,890
All right, everybody.
Let's hear a nice round of applause...

578
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,594
for our final contestant,
Mona Dearly.

579
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,707
All right. Nice grouping.

580
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,007
Everybody,
give her another round of applause.

581
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,074
Now we await the judges' decision.

582
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:32,680
The judges are deciding
who will win the coveted Golden Angel.

583
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:44,863
The winner of Verplanck's
knife-throwing contest is...

584
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,597
Bobby Calzone!

585
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,368
Oh, my God!
I never win anything.

586
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,466
Just a goddamn minute!

587
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,348
- You didn't vote for me.
- Well, sorta.

588
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,145
"Sorta"?
They all say " Bobby."

589
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,516
- Really?
- Phil, you're my husband.

590
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:07,045
- You're supposed to support me.
- Yeah, but Bobby had really good form.

591
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,718
- Thanks, Mr. Dearly.
- You're welcome, Bob.

592
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,421
- We're just having a little fun here.
- Fun?

593
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,863
I lost, Wyatt. I'm a loser.
Does that sound like fun to you?

594
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,493
- Mona, I'm sorry that you lost, but...
- Yeah.

595
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,231
It's just a lousy little contest.
I know.

596
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,535
- Everybody can't be a winner, Mona.
- But I've never been a winner.

597
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,804
- I've never had my chance.
- You're blowin' this out of proportion.

598
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,744
- It's just a knife-throwing contest.
- To you, maybe.

599
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:32,247
But not to me.
I really wanted this...

600
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,375
just for one day,
one day, to be a winner.

601
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,649
To have everybody look at me and say,
"Yo, way to go, Mona."

602
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:41,020
Would it have killed you
to let me take home that prize, huh?

603
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,261
Just for one day,
to let me feel good about myself?

604
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,529
I don't know what to say.

605
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,435
You can have the trophy.
I'm gonna have a second chance.

606
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:57,030
Why don't you take that trophy
and shove it up your ass, Calzone?

607
00:47:57,107 --> 00:48:00,042
Mona, Bobby's just trying to help.

608
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,374
- I don't need his sympathy.
- Know what my mother used to say?

609
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,074
" Life gives you potatoes:
make potato salad."

610
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,712
Well, life handed me a pile of shit.
What am I supposed to make out of that?

611
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,276
Shit salad?

612
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,319
Just shut up.

613
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,555
The whole pack of youse
just shut up!

614
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,002
Come here.

615
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,045
Look. I've been thinkin'.

616
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,478
Oh, no. Don't.

617
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,140
Listen to me.

618
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:17,050
Jeff Dearly's key chain
is on a rack in his kitchen.

619
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,089
- Great. Wonderful.
- But where's it supposed to be?

620
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,285
- I have no idea. Why don't you tell me?
- Hanging from the ignition...

621
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,419
of the victim's car.

622
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,861
- What about Mona's keys?
- That's what I'm sayin'.

623
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:30,923
Mona's keys were on Jeff s key ring
in the kitchen.

624
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,834
Jeff s keys were on Mona's key chain
in the car.

625
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,735
So somebody switched their keys?

626
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,176
- Definitely.
- No, I don't think so.

627
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,211
Oh, you don't think so?

628
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:46,943
As far as I'm concerned, " Ding-dong,
the witch is dead." End of story.

629
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,761
One less ain't gonna kill her.

630
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,439
It's kinda weird, you know,
seein' the tombstone and all.

631
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,503
" Demoted wife, mother and dressmaker."

632
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,678
I didn't know your mom
was a dressmaker.

633
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,742
Me neither.

634
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:45,806
Guess what. They're callin'
Mona's accident a "case"...

635
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,835
which means they don't think she died
because of some slippery road.

636
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,508
- So?
- So that means there's an investigation.

637
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:57,246
It means they have leads.
Phil, I watch A&E.

638
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,811
I understand
the way a cop's mind works.

639
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,688
You see, they see you
standin' here touchin' me...

640
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:05,853
and the next thing you know, there's
the background check and the profile...

641
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,453
and the psychological workup.

642
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:11,960
- I just came for lunch.
- Phil, these are smart guys.

643
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:14,469
These are really, really smart guys.
They have tools.

644
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,336
- Tools?
- Yeah. Of the trade?

645
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,932
So what are you tryin' to say?

646
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,173
Just stop bein' so damn conspicuous,
would you, please?

647
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,907
Okay.

648
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,915
Good. I'll see you later
at the Charm.

649
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,951
- Yeah.
- Stop it!
