179
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:38,499
Come on, Mikey.
Come on, Mikey.

180
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,768
Come on, Mikey.

181
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:41,302
JOHN:
Sometime today, pitcher.

182
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,571
GINA: Come on, Mikey!

183
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,572
Strike!

184
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,574
Strike? What?
Are you blind?

185
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,577
Keep your head
down on the ball!

186
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,579
I hate this pitcher.
How old is he?

187
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,282
Twelve.
Twelve, my ass.

188
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,752
His beard grew an inch
between pitches.

189
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,086
Let's go, Mikey!

190
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:59,655
Put your elbow up, son.
Elbow up.

191
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,690
Go! Go, baby! Go!

192
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,760
DENISE:
There you go, baby!

193
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:04,827
Safe!

194
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,696
Tie goes to the runner.

195
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:10,968
Go! Go!

196
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,602
Run! Run! Run! Run!

197
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,140
DENISE: Keep it going.
Let's go!

198
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:20,010
BOY: Second base!
Second base!

199
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,813
Second base!

200
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:26,984
Mike!

201
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:31,156
Mike.
Mikey!

202
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:33,958
Michael? Michael?
Mikey, baby.

203
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,860
Somebody call
an ambulance!

204
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:37,561
Mikey. Mikey.

205
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:38,663
Michael.

206
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,965
JIMMY: Somebody call
a frigging ambulance!

207
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:45,170
JOHN:
Get the door!

208
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:46,871
GINA: Get the door,
Jimmy.

209
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,706
JIMMY:
Come on, let's go!

210
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:50,275
I got it.

211
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,443
Take him, baby.

212
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,313
Give him to me.
Mikey, Mikey.

213
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,782
Come on, baby, it's mama.
Come on, Mikey.

214
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,985
We got to get
out of here. Mikey! Go!

215
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,051
DENISE: Help us!

216
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:32,219
Help!
Please, somebody.

217
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:33,419
Calm down.

218
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:34,921
He's not breathing.
He's not breathing.

219
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:37,124
All right,
come with me.

220
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:40,094
He was just playing baseball,
running to second base.

221
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,795
I don't know
what happened.

222
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,431
I need a doctor
right away, please!

223
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:45,466
JOHN: No. Jesus.

224
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,134
DENISE: Mikey?
What happened?

225
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:48,802
He collapsed
playing baseball.

226
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,872
Let's get him
on some oxygen.

227
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:53,474
He's going to be
all right, isn't he?

228
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,409
Anything like this
ever happen before?

229
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,443
No, ma'am.

230
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,113
Any allergies?

231
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:00,048
Nothing. Nothing!

232
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,449
Allergies
to medication?

233
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:02,784
No, he's fine.

234
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,987
His liver's enlarged.
Flip him.

235
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,721
He's going to be
all right, isn't he?

236
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:09,925
Pulse is 150, pulse Ox 78%.
B.P. 68 over 34.

237
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,260
What is the matter
with him?

238
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,328
Would you come with me?

239
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:14,997
There are procedures
we need to go over.

240
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:15,998
What procedures?

241
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:17,299
We're admitting your son.

242
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,835
You need to fill out
the proper forms.

243
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:21,504
Your son may need
a transfusion.

244
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,672
We'll need to test you both
for blood type.

245
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,808
Mikey, we're coming
right back, baby.

246
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:28,077
Wait a minute!

247
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,845
WOMAN:
First name, Mr. Archibald.

248
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:31,381
Uh, John.

249
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:32,815
Middle initial?

250
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:34,317
Q. Quincy.

251
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:35,919
Name of your
insurance company?

252
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,453
JIMMY: John!

253
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,854
Where is he?
Is he okay?

254
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:40,790
We don't know yet.
They're running tests.

255
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,626
We're waiting
to find the results.

256
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,228
Anything we can do?

257
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:45,762
Your card,
Mr. Archibald.

258
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,298
Mikey's hat.
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:48,632
Your insurance card.

260
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,701
I'll need to make a copy
for our files.

261
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:58,876
It's okay.
You can go in now.

262
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,542
Hey, sweetheart.

263
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:36,248
How you doing, slugger?

264
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:41,787
(WHISPERING)
I can't talk.

265
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:43,622
Don't worry about it.
Get your rest.

266
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,258
We're going to be
out of here in a while.

267
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:48,695
Okay.

268
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:51,331
We love you, son.

269
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:53,567
I love you, too.

270
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:58,872
What is all this?

271
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,842
This? This is so we can
monitor Mike's vitals.

272
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:05,612
Respiratory rate,
pulse oximetry, heart rate.

273
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,084
And this one is blood pressure--
diastolic and systolic.

274
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:13,120
We'd like this top number
to stay above 90.

275
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,655
If his blood pressure drops,

276
00:17:14,723 --> 00:17:15,790
we're going to have to
do something.

277
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:17,925
We can't have him going
below 70 again.

278
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:22,262
Why? What would that mean,
if he went below 70 again?

279
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,733
70 and below,
he's in heart failure.

280
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:29,704
Okay.

281
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,106
If you need anything.

282
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,273
Thank you.

283
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:40,582
WOMAN:
How's the company insurance?

284
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,250
He works part time.

285
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:44,686
She works
as a grocery store clerk.

286
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,087
Can we do anything?

287
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:48,189
I got to go.

288
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:49,725
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald.

289
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,495
Hello, I'm Rebecca Payne,
hospital director.

290
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:54,330
Hi, there.
It's nice to meet you.

291
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:56,465
This is Dr. Turner,
the head of cardiology

292
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,600
and Michael's doctor.

293
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:58,601
Oh. Okay.

294
00:17:58,669 --> 00:17:59,769
How do you do?

295
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,270
Good. My wife.
Hello.

296
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:02,805
How's our boy doing?

297
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,675
Please sit down.

298
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:24,695
Okay.

299
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,868
This X-ray shows a normal
nine-year-old's heart.

300
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:35,173
This X-ray is that
of your son Michael.

301
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,145
There are septal defects
here, here, and here

302
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:43,982
which have induced myopathy,
resulting pulmonary edema,

303
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,817
and malignant
ventricular ectopy.

304
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:48,319
As you can see,
Michael's heart is approximately

305
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:50,488
three times larger
than normal size.

306
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:53,058
I'm sorry. Uh...

307
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,060
I didn't understand
what you said.

308
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:57,063
Could you put that
in layman terms for me?

309
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,598
Basically,
there's not enough blood

310
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:01,701
being pumped
by Michael's heart,

311
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:06,739
so it backs up in the lungs
like a sponge getting wet.

312
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:10,242
His heart is trying,
but it's working too hard.

313
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,012
What, does he need
an operation, or...

314
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,716
Well, we're considerably
beyond corrective surgery,

315
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:19,419
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald.

316
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:21,387
Mike's heart is useless.

317
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:24,290
He's going to need a transplant
or he's going to die.

318
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:29,395
Wait a second.
There are other options.

319
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:31,464
What options?

320
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:32,933
To do nothing.

321
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:36,369
Medicate him. Make him feel
as comfortable as possible.

322
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,905
Start thinking
about quality of life now.

323
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:40,708
DENISE:
I don't understand.

324
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:45,446
We were just with him,
and he seemed fine.

325
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:48,449
He's going to seem fine,
but as his heart gets worse,

326
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:50,484
he will become
increasingly fatigued,

327
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:53,487
and he will sleep
more and more,

328
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:56,357
until one day
he will fall asleep,

329
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:59,961
and he won't wake up.

330
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:03,132
I know this is difficult,
but you have to face the fact

331
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,301
that your son
may not live much longer.

332
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:09,905
You might want to make it
a happy time, say good-bye.

333
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:12,574
God.

334
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:14,009
Transplantation
is high-risk.

335
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:16,578
You could lose your son
on that table.

336
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:19,048
You might not want
to take that chance.

337
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:25,288
If you, you know, if he
doesn't have the surgery...

338
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:33,396
If he doesn't have the surgery,
how long would he live?

339
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:36,966
Not long.
Months, weeks.

340
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,668
Days.

341
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,372
Come on. All right.
All right. All right.

342
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,141
Come on, now.

343
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,220
(WHISPERS)
I'm sorry. This--

344
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,355
this is a lot.

345
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,708
All right. Uh...

346
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,177
Okay.

347
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,312
If he was your son,
what would you do?

348
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,984
I'd do the transplant,
absolutely.

349
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:29,288
Okay. Okay?

350
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:34,493
Okay, let's do that.
Let's do it.

351
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:35,895
TURNER: Yes?
Yes.

352
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:39,132
Okay, first thing we've got
to do is get Mike's name

353
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,867
on the organ recipient list.

354
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:44,137
He's b-positive, so his name
should go right to the top.

355
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:45,271
It's not so simple.

356
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,939
There are
other considerations

357
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,876
before a prospective recipient
can be placed on a donor list.

358
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:52,545
Transplant surgery
is very expensive.

359
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,748
In most cases,
prohibitively so.

360
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,085
Oh, we got insurance,
major medical. He's covered.

361
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:00,020
We've already checked
with your carrier.

362
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:01,955
There are no provisions
in your policy

363
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:03,791
for a procedure
of this magnitude.

364
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:06,226
Oh, no, no, no,
that's a mistake.

365
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:08,295
Not that you're making
a mistake.

366
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:10,798
I'm just saying
that I'm insured.

367
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:12,500
My son's covered.

368
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,203
Mrs. Archibald,
do you have coverage?

369
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:17,371
No. I've only been
at the supermarket

370
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:20,041
a couple months, and you
don't get benefits until--

371
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:22,043
doesn't matter.
We got insurance.

372
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:27,648
Okay, I can see here that
you don't own your home.

373
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:30,451
You have no stocks,
no bonds, no investments.

374
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,921
You have a little over $1,000
in savings.

375
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:34,122
But we got insurance.

376
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:36,058
That may be.
Check with your carrier.

377
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:37,726
In the meantime,

378
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:40,395
we're going to have to
treat this as a cash account.

379
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:41,463
What?

380
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:43,465
How much
does a transplant cost?

381
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,468
Let me take care--
how much does it cost?

382
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:48,871
Transplant surgery,
doctors' fees,

383
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:51,006
postoperative care,
immunosuppressant drugs--

384
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:54,143
you're looking
at a minimum of $250,000.

385
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:55,277
Wow.

386
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:57,347
If you opt
for transplant surgery,

387
00:22:57,414 --> 00:22:58,882
that is your choice,

388
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,384
but the hospital maintains
a very strict policy

389
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:03,186
with regard
to cash patients.

390
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:05,555
We require a down payment

391
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:08,158
before we put a patient's name
on a receivers' list.

392
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:10,593
How much?

393
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:14,164
30%--$75,000.

394
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:16,399
$75,000...

395
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,504
To put my son's name
on a list.

396
00:23:20,572 --> 00:23:23,640
Our son is dying, and all you
can do is talk about money?

397
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,943
It costs money
to provide health care.

398
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:29,513
It's expensive for you,
it's expensive for us.

399
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,883
I'm sorry. You're going to
have to guarantee payment

400
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,285
before I can put
your son's name on the list.

401
00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:39,724
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald,
please wait!

402
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,061
If you people don't want
to treat our son,

403
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:45,264
we'll take him
over to county memorial.

404
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:46,698
You don't want to do that.

405
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:48,200
They have to treat him.

406
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:50,668
No. Heart transplantation
is always considered

407
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:52,170
an elective procedure.

408
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:53,705
You're
in the right place.

409
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:55,640
What are we
supposed to do?

410
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,575
Talk to your
insurance company again.

411
00:23:57,643 --> 00:23:59,511
Check with our
human resources department

412
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:00,712
for medical assistance.

413
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,881
There's money there.

414
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:04,083
There's children's
state services and medicaid.

415
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,085
You find a way
to keep him here.

416
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,788
You just don't take no
for an answer.

417
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:13,626
Your policy has changed,
Mr. Archibald.

418
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,329
Changed to what?

419
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:18,331
Yeah, we've recently
switched carriers

420
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,699
from a PPO to an HMO.

421
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,402
It's a less expensive
policy,

422
00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:25,339
but unfortunately,
there are some restrictions.

423
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:27,007
What kind of restrictions?

424
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:29,243
Here's how it works.

425
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:31,946
Non-management part-time
employees such as yourself

426
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:35,082
only qualify for second-tier
catastrophic coverage.

427
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,551
No, no, I'm not part time,
I'm full time.

428
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:39,186
It's just slow right now.

429
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:42,656
Sure, but your coverage
is based on hours worked,

430
00:24:42,723 --> 00:24:45,526
and like I said, you only
qualify for second tier,

431
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:48,763
and that has a maximum
payout limit of $20,000.

432
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:50,665
What?

433
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,536
You have been taking money
out of my check every week.

434
00:24:55,604 --> 00:24:58,406
I've been paying into
this policy for years.

435
00:24:58,474 --> 00:25:01,276
That's why we're going to
cover you for the full $20,000.

436
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:05,413
You're kidding me, right?
I mean, come on.

437
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:06,915
Let me get this straight.

438
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:10,953
You have dropped me
from full time to part time.

439
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:12,421
<i>You switched carriers.</i>

440
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:14,590
Now you're telling me
I'm not fully covered

441
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:18,194
even though I got a policy
that says I am?

442
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:20,196
It doesn't seem right,
does it?

443
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:22,631
No, it doesn't.
My son is very sick.

444
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:25,201
If I'm not covered,
I got a serious problem.

445
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:28,571
I understand that,
but there's nothing I can do.

446
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,474
Look, you can file
an appeal.

447
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:31,541
Yeah?

448
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:33,043
Here you go.

449
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:35,712
That takes about seven
working days.

450
00:25:50,795 --> 00:25:53,131
WOMAN: Says here you already
have medical insurance.

451
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:54,265
JOHN: Not enough.

452
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,401
What little we have
is already used up.

453
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,936
You on welfare?
No.

454
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,272
You should be on welfare.

455
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,174
Welfare?
We both have jobs.

456
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:04,842
That's too bad.

457
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,045
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

458
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:08,913
Try county medical.

459
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,583
Yes, ma'am, I need to speak
to somebody in financial aid.

460
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:15,154
No, I don't want to hold.

461
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:17,822
I've been holding 15 minutes.
I don't want to hold.

No what?

472
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:07,141
No, you don't qualify.

473

My son is dying,
I'm broke.

474
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,578
If I don't qualify,
who the hell does?

475
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:12,246
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:14,681
I don't need you to be sorry!
I need you to help me!

477
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:42,512
no, no, no,
this is an appeal.

478
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,947
An appeal is for
an already existing claim.

479
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:47,383
What you needed to file
was a grievance.

480
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:49,118
You filed
the wrong paperwork.

481
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:51,354
You're going to
have to resubmit.

482
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,022
It could take 30 days.

483
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,923
I don't have 30 days.
I know.

484
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:56,759
I'm getting sick
of the runaround.

485
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:59,762
What I need is my son's
name on that list.

486
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:02,533
Your account is
in excess of $30,000.

487
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,335
The hospital has bent over
backwards to help you out.

488
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:06,403
Is that right?

489
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,272

I got to pay cash.

That's handled
by the board of trustees.

You're head of cardiac surgery.
You make a recommendation,

aren't they?

Send him home.

at the brochure last night.

It says this hospital does over
300 heart surgeries a year.

602
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:07,677
300 surgeries,
$250,000 a pop.

603
00:35:07,744 --> 00:35:10,212
You know how much that is?
I did the math.

604
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,882
That's $75 million worth
of heart surgeries.

605
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,419
You're telling me you can't
do one for me in good faith?

606
00:35:16,487 --> 00:35:19,122
I waived my fee
in your son's case.

607
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,257
Nobody asked you
to waive the fee.

608
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:22,893

609
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:25,228

came up with $22,000,

the opportunity.

00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:33,737
I'm only getting 20 hours
on the job. I can do this.

613
00:35:33,805 --> 00:35:37,441
I can pay. I swear to God,
I'll pay you the money back.

614
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:39,577
I don't know how,
but I promise I will.

615
00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:41,079
Just trust me.

616
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:44,849
I give you my word
as a man. Please.

617
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:49,520
Could you take your hands
off me, please?

618
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:54,358

<i>The building is surrounded.
There's no way in or out.</i>

876
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:40,167
<i>If you hear me,
I advise you to respond.</i>

877
00:46:41,136 --> 00:46:43,270
<i>Hello?</i>

878
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:45,405
<i>Hello, is anyone there?</i>

879
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:47,941
Yeah.

880
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:49,476
This is
Lieutenant Frank Grimes

881
00:46:49,544 --> 00:46:51,446
of the Chicago
Police Department.

882
00:46:51,514 --> 00:46:53,714
Are you the man in charge?

883
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:57,252
That's right.

884
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:59,187
Who am I speaking to?

885
00:47:00,922 --> 00:47:02,123
John...

886
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:05,059
Q.

887
00:47:06,828 --> 00:47:08,929
All right, John Q.

888
00:47:08,997 --> 00:47:12,468
Again, I'm Lieutenant Grimes,
but I want you to call me Frank.

889
00:47:12,536 --> 00:47:13,902
Can you do that?

890
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,404
Sure, Frank.

891
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:17,105
I'll be
the hostage negotiator.

892
00:47:17,174 --> 00:47:19,908
I've been a cop 35 years.
This is all I do.

893
00:47:19,976 --> 00:47:22,010
I don't play games.
I don't fool around.

894
00:47:22,078 --> 00:47:25,181
If I say something,
you can take it to the bank.

895
00:47:25,248 --> 00:47:26,915
Let's get down to it.

896
00:47:26,983 --> 00:47:29,485
Is anybody hurt?

897
00:47:29,553 --> 00:47:31,687
It's an emergency room.
Everybody's hurt.

898
00:47:31,754 --> 00:47:33,021
Oh, right.

899
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:34,658
They're fine.
Good.

900
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:38,161
As long as it stays that way,
we can keep talking.

901
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:39,696
What is it you want?

902
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:42,098
You find Rebecca Payne,

903
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,601
Hope Memorial's
administrative supervisor.

904
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:45,835
You find her.

905
00:47:45,903 --> 00:47:49,105
Tell her I want my kid's name
on the donors' list.

906
00:47:49,173 --> 00:47:52,175
You got that? My kid's name
on the donors' list.

907
00:47:52,243 --> 00:47:53,643
Kid boy or girl?

908
00:47:53,711 --> 00:47:54,944
A boy.

909
00:47:55,012 --> 00:47:59,483
I got two boys myself, John.
Two girls and two boys.

910
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:02,152
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't handle me, Frank.

911
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:03,821
I don't want to be handled.

912
00:48:03,888 --> 00:48:06,156
It insults my intelligence
as a human being!

913
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:09,527
Take it easy. The idea
is not to get too excited.

914
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,363
I'm going to take it any way
I can get it, understand?

915
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,332
If I don't get it,
there's going to be

916
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:16,601
some dead bodies
on your hands in there.

917
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:18,169
You understand me?

918
00:48:18,238 --> 00:48:20,004
I hear you loud and clear.

919
00:48:20,072 --> 00:48:22,241
I'm going to jot that down.
Rebecca Payne, right?

920
00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:23,975
All right.

921
00:48:24,043 --> 00:48:27,846
Now, there's a lot of cops
out here, John.

922
00:48:27,913 --> 00:48:30,515
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

923
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,251
Yeah, I'm sure.

924
00:48:33,353 --> 00:48:34,753
All right, sit tight.

925
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,655
You're in a tough spot,
John, a lot of trouble,

926
00:48:36,723 --> 00:48:39,325
but if you work with me,
if you're reasonable,

927
00:48:39,393 --> 00:48:41,527
we'll figure a way
out of this, okay?

928
00:48:41,595 --> 00:48:43,763
We have to have a little faith
in one another.

929
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,365
Why is that, Frank?

930
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:46,899
Why?

931
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,901
Because that's what faith's
all about--

932
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:52,672
believing when you don't want
to believe.

933
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,308
Besides, what else
are you going to do?

934
00:48:57,678 --> 00:48:59,679
MIRIAM:
I want my epidural.

935
00:48:59,747 --> 00:49:01,214
Something for the pain.

936
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:04,351
Out!
She'll be fine.

937
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:06,887
MIRIAM: (CRYING)

938
00:49:13,861 --> 00:49:15,128
First child?

939
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:17,864
Yeah. Yeah.

940
00:49:17,932 --> 00:49:20,267
Just kind of nervous.
You know how it is.

941
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:21,702
Yeah, I was, too.

942
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,205
What do you want,
a boy or a girl?

943
00:49:24,273 --> 00:49:28,242
Doesn't matter to me, man,
as long as my kid's healthy.

944
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:29,844
That's all I want.

945
00:49:33,816 --> 00:49:36,384
Listen, I didn't mean
anything by that, man.

946
00:49:44,294 --> 00:49:47,963
Who was driving?
The car--who was driving?

947
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:52,100
I was. What's that
got to do with anything?

948
00:49:52,168 --> 00:49:55,270
Why is your girl
all banged up and you're not?

949
00:49:57,474 --> 00:49:59,442
What do you call this?
Ha ha.

950
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:01,510
What are you laughing at?

951
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:03,446
Somebody get this fool
a band-aid.

952
00:50:03,513 --> 00:50:05,314
I don't want you
to bleed to death.

953
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:09,319
Ha ha. Screw you, man.
That shit hurts.

954
00:50:09,387 --> 00:50:11,621
His air bag went off
and mine didn't.

955
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:13,923
What kind of car
you drive?

956
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,258
Mercedes 500.

957
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:17,627
You drive a Mercedes 500?

958
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:19,128
What year?

959
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:22,198
1986. It's a classic.

960
00:50:22,266 --> 00:50:24,067
Mercedes didn't make

961
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:27,303
passenger-side air bags
till 1988.

962
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:30,775
(CHUCKLES) Busted.

963
00:50:30,843 --> 00:50:32,042
What's your point,
John?

964
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:33,944
What's yours, Mitch?

965
00:50:34,012 --> 00:50:35,646
You from
the slap-a-ho tribe.

966
00:50:35,714 --> 00:50:37,715
You like to beat
on that young lady,

967
00:50:37,783 --> 00:50:39,550
and everybody here
knows it.

968
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:46,223
I was drunk, all right?

969
00:50:57,737 --> 00:50:58,970
Don't smoke in here.

970
00:50:59,038 --> 00:51:02,173
Give me a break.
Work with me here.

971
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:03,709
I'm trying my best.

972
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:06,011
Mr. Q, could I get
some water?

973
00:51:06,078 --> 00:51:08,213
And I need to tinkle.

974
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:11,050
I got missed-meal cramps.

975
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:13,986
I'm hungry. Let's get a bucket
of chicken or something.

976
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:17,156
In a minute, okay?
How's it going in there?

977
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:19,091
He's going to make it.

978
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,628
You have any idea how much
blood this guy lost?

979
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:24,831
It's incredible.
He saved this man's life.

980
00:51:38,212 --> 00:51:39,279
What's that?

981
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,181
Lasix.
It's a diuretic

982
00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:43,717
to help get rid of some
of the fluid buildup.

983
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:44,718
But it's
potassium-depleting,

984
00:51:44,786 --> 00:51:47,154
so he needs this one
to supplement.

985
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:49,189
And those?

986
00:51:49,257 --> 00:51:51,091
Dopamine
for his blood pressure,

987
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:53,293
dig for his heart,
primacor.

988
00:51:54,262 --> 00:51:56,982
Gosh, it seems
like so much.

989
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,267
Yeah, it's a lot.
This is antibiotic.

990
00:51:59,335 --> 00:52:00,635
What for?

991
00:52:00,703 --> 00:52:03,404
It's prophylactic,
just in case.

992
00:52:06,442 --> 00:52:08,777
And those?
These two?

993
00:52:08,845 --> 00:52:10,979
They're for pain.

994
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:13,448
I don't feel so good.

995
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:15,450
This is going to
make you feel yucky

996
00:52:15,518 --> 00:52:17,987
for a few minutes, buddy,
but I'm going to get you

997
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:20,656
some of those crunchy
ice chips that you want.

998
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:22,057
How does that sound?

999
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:23,459
Yeah.

1000
00:52:23,527 --> 00:52:25,895
Hey, Mike, by the way,
there was this guy,

1001
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:27,797
he stopped by to see you.

1002
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:30,232
He said he was
a friend of yours.

1003
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,134
I got him right here.

1004
00:52:32,202 --> 00:52:34,637
I didn't know if I should
let him in or not.

1005
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:36,005
What do you think?

1006
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:37,640
Yeah, he's okay.
He's okay?

1007
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:39,977
Said he wanted
to hang out with you.

1008
00:52:40,044 --> 00:52:41,277
He's okay.

1009
00:52:41,345 --> 00:52:42,445
That's great.

1010
00:52:42,514 --> 00:52:44,648
(WHISPERS) Okay.

1011
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:46,316
Thank you.

1012
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,159
WOMAN: (SOBBING)

1013
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:04,869
Oh, my baby!

1014
00:53:04,937 --> 00:53:07,572
Let me hold my baby!

1015
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,708
Let me hold my baby!

1016
00:53:10,776 --> 00:53:14,178
Mom? Is dad coming?

1017
00:53:14,246 --> 00:53:17,081
Yeah, he's coming.

1018
00:53:17,149 --> 00:53:21,118
When? Where is he?

1019
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:26,025
I don't know,
but he's coming.

1020
00:53:35,802 --> 00:53:37,770
(WHISPERS)
What are you up to?

1021
00:53:37,837 --> 00:53:39,939
Never mind me.
You're worthless.

1022
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:41,941
You should have zapped
the bastard

1023
00:53:42,008 --> 00:53:43,777
when you had the chance.

1024
00:53:43,844 --> 00:53:46,646
With what? Besides, I'm not
sticking my neck on the line.

1025
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:49,950
Not for $8.50 an hour,
I'm not.

1026
00:53:58,726 --> 00:54:00,493
Pay dirt.
Are you nuts?

1027
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:02,261
What the hell
are you doing?

1028
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:04,097
Looking out
for number one.

1029
00:54:04,164 --> 00:54:06,100
You want to stay alive,
sit tight

1030
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:08,102
and wait for the cavalry
to get here.

1031
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:09,971
The cops
are coming in shooting.

1032
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,772
They don't care
about his kid.

1033
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,210
Once he realizes that,
we're all history.

1034
00:54:16,277 --> 00:54:18,212
If he catches you
with that scalpel,

1035
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:20,214
you're the one
that's history, asshole.

1036
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:22,717
Really? He doesn't look
so bad to me.

1037
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:24,719
"Ethyl chloride."
Just like mace.

1038
00:54:24,786 --> 00:54:27,789
Listen, put that stuff back
before you get us in trouble.

1039
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:29,791
No, you listen,
you stupid rent-a-cop.

1040
00:54:29,859 --> 00:54:32,961
I am not a slob, all right?
I have a life.

1041
00:54:33,029 --> 00:54:35,063
It means something to me.

1042
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:38,066
I'm not going down
in this shithole. No, sir.

1043

Yeah, it is.

for artillery, isn't it?

1061
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:15,505
Well, maybe.
Maybe not.

1062
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,507
You should tell me.
What's going on?

1063
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:19,977
You're looking at it.
A very upset father inside.

We'll give him
a couple minutes to cool off.

Let's not give him
too much time.

Let's just end this
quick and quiet, okay?

1067

That's the plan.
Good.

1068
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:35,593
Good. In that case,
I'm just here

to lend my support
in any way that I can.

I don't need a babysitter
on this. It's under control.

Is it?
Yes, it is.

I don't understand why they
never found it, the doctors.

My son has had
clean checkups every year

since the day he was born.

1098
00:56:48,804 --> 00:56:51,038
How could the doctors
not pick it up?

1099
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:53,074
He might not have been tested
thoroughly enough.

1100
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:54,208
Why not?

1101
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:59,181
You got an HMO, right?

1102
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,683
Yeah.
There's your answer.

1103
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,887
HMOs pay their doctors
not to test.

1104
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:07,022
It's their way
of keeping costs down.

1105
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,024
Say Mike did need
additional testing

1106
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,059
and insurance says
they won't cover them.

1107
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:13,495
The doctor keeps his mouth
shut, and come Christmas,

1108
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:17,399
the hmo sends the doctor
a fat-ass bonus check.

1109
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:19,868
Is that true?
Possible.

1110
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,272
Not likely,
but possible.

1111
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:25,041
These doctors may have known
what was wrong with my son,

1112
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,376
and they could have
treated him all along?

1113

against that?

There's also ways
around those laws.

1386
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,348
Mr. Palumbo,
what can you tell us

1387
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:46,682
about John Archibald?

1388
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:51,287
You know, um,
I got to be honest, Tuck.

1389
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:56,659
I mean, this whole thing, uh,
sucks, you know?

1390
01:09:56,727 --> 01:09:59,562
It all could have been avoided
so incredibly easy.

1391
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:01,165
I mean, uh,

1392
01:10:01,233 --> 01:10:04,101
<i>none of this had to happen
if John had been a millionaire</i>

1393
01:10:04,169 --> 01:10:05,970
<i>or if his last name
was Rockefeller,</i>

1394
01:10:06,037 --> 01:10:07,671
<i>but sometimes
John don't get it.</i>

1395
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:09,373
<i>He don't understand</i>

1396
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,343
<i>that what we hold sacred
in this country isn't values.</i>

<i>Well, I can see this is
making you very upset,</i>

1408
01:10:45,879 --> 01:10:48,480

to John Q right now,</i>

1409
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:50,983

01:27:31,563 --> 01:27:33,063
Go!

1728
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:41,555
CROWD: (BOOING)

1729
01:27:45,777 --> 01:27:47,512
We're in trouble, John.

1730
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:50,382
Mike's blood pressure
has dropped into the mid-40s.

1731
01:27:50,449 --> 01:27:53,117
His atrial blood pressure
should be in the low teens.

1732
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,319
It's 35.

1733
01:27:54,387 --> 01:27:55,853
I'm sorry, John.

1734
01:27:55,921 --> 01:27:59,824
Without a new heart,
he's not going to make it.

1735
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:05,062
Okay.

1736
01:28:06,732 --> 01:28:08,100
Then take mine.

1737
01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:11,170
What?
You heard me.

1738
01:28:11,237 --> 01:28:13,806
Take my heart,
and you put it in Mike.

1739
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:16,141
MAN:
You done lost your damn mind.

1740
01:28:16,209 --> 01:28:17,443
You can't be serious.

1741
01:28:17,511 --> 01:28:19,745
You bet I'm serious.
I'm dead serious.

1742
01:28:19,813 --> 01:28:20,879
Oh, my God.

1743
01:28:20,947 --> 01:28:23,349
Wow.
Man, you'll be dead.

1744
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:26,786
And my son will live.
It's the only way.

1745
01:28:26,853 --> 01:28:28,987
No, physically,
you can't do this.

1746
01:28:29,055 --> 01:28:31,558
Yes, I can.
I kill myself.

1747
01:28:31,626 --> 01:28:33,627
You open me up,
you take my heart.

1748
01:28:33,695 --> 01:28:35,662
It's perfect.
That's crazy.

1749
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:39,599
We can't just remove your heart
and put it into Michael's body.

1750
01:28:39,667 --> 01:28:42,336
Matching donor and recipient
is extremely complicated.

1751
01:28:42,403 --> 01:28:44,971
There are critical tests
that have to be taken--

1752
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:47,341
cross matches for blood type,
chest cavity measurements.

1753
01:28:47,408 --> 01:28:50,043
If both blood tissues are not
completely compatible--

1754
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:53,381
I know about compatibility.
We've been tested up the wazoo.

1755
01:28:53,449 --> 01:28:56,116
We're both b-positive.
Our tissues match.

1756
01:28:56,184 --> 01:28:59,053
His heart's three times the size
of normal, so mine will fit.

1757
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,021
You know damn well
we're compatible.

1758
01:29:01,089 --> 01:29:02,457
Out of the question.
Too risky.

1759
01:29:02,524 --> 01:29:04,525
Doc, I'm telling you,
he will make it!

1760
01:29:04,593 --> 01:29:05,626
Can't do it.

1761
01:29:05,694 --> 01:29:07,628
If I'm laying
on the floor, dead,

1762
01:29:07,696 --> 01:29:10,064
you're not going to take
my heart and save his life?

1763
01:29:10,131 --> 01:29:11,733
You'll let two die
instead of one

1764
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,268
because of a technicality?

1765
01:29:13,336 --> 01:29:15,738
I think what John
is trying to do is right.

1766
01:29:15,805 --> 01:29:17,573
Me, too.
It's so brave.

1767
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,208
What do you think Mike
would want? Your wife?

1768
01:29:20,276 --> 01:29:22,277
Mike's too young to know
what's good for him.

1769
01:29:22,345 --> 01:29:26,147
It's my job to protect him.
Denise would do the same thing.

1770
01:29:26,215 --> 01:29:30,469
John, look, I know what's
happening to Mike is bad.

1771
01:29:30,471 --> 01:29:32,320
Matter of fact,
it's the worst.

1772
01:29:32,389 --> 01:29:35,825
But killing yourself ain't
going to solve a damn thing.

1773
01:29:35,893 --> 01:29:40,296
Sometimes you just
got to let go and let God...

1774
01:29:40,364 --> 01:29:42,999
Just accept it, brother.

1775
01:29:43,066 --> 01:29:45,268
Accept it?

1776
01:29:45,335 --> 01:29:47,670
Accept what?

1777
01:29:48,972 --> 01:29:50,339
Accept what?

1778
01:29:50,408 --> 01:29:51,775
That Mike is going to die.

1779
01:29:51,842 --> 01:29:53,376
No.

1780
01:29:53,444 --> 01:29:57,548
No, I don't
accept that...Ever.

1781
01:29:58,517 --> 01:30:00,484
No, I reject that
out of hand.

1782
01:30:00,552 --> 01:30:03,120
I mean, look, all right,
he's a patient to you,

1783
01:30:03,187 --> 01:30:05,989
I understand, but if you--
he's a good kid.

1784
01:30:06,057 --> 01:30:08,592
I mean, he's--
he loves bodybuilding.

1785
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:12,362
He wants to be a bodybuilder.
Can you believe that?

1786
01:30:12,431 --> 01:30:15,399
<i>He's funny, he's--
you'd like him.</i>

1787
01:30:15,467 --> 01:30:18,002
You'd like him, doc,
if you got to know him.

1788
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:19,270
I do like him.

1789
01:30:19,338 --> 01:30:22,040
Then, please,
I'm just begging you,

1790
01:30:22,107 --> 01:30:23,374
step outside the rules.

1791
01:30:23,443 --> 01:30:25,376
I'd like to, John,
I really would,

1792
01:30:25,445 --> 01:30:27,378
but what you're asking
crosses the line.

1793
01:30:27,447 --> 01:30:29,648
It is completely
unethical.

1794
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:31,650
I'm crossing the line?
You're crossing the line.

1795
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:33,985
The whole system
is crossing the line.

1796
01:30:34,053 --> 01:30:36,387
Maybe you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

1797
01:30:36,456 --> 01:30:40,359
I don't give a damn.
My son's going to live.

1798
01:30:40,427 --> 01:30:42,361
Maybe you haven't
figured that out by now.

1799
01:30:42,429 --> 01:30:45,030
I'll do whatever I got to do
for him to live.

1800
01:30:45,098 --> 01:30:48,668
What are you going to do,
shoot me if I don't operate?

1801
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:51,604
No.

1802
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:53,873
I'm going to kill myself.

1803
01:30:53,941 --> 01:30:55,575
(COCKS PISTOL)

1804
01:30:55,642 --> 01:30:59,078
All right?
Let's just see what happens.

1805
01:30:59,145 --> 01:31:01,849
That's what this is all about, right?
He needs a donor.

1806
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,784
Somebody's got to die
for him to live.

1807
01:31:03,852 --> 01:31:05,418
I'm his father.
It's me.

1808
01:31:15,229 --> 01:31:16,530
All right.

1809
01:31:16,598 --> 01:31:18,164
MITCH: All right?
All right what?

1810
01:31:18,232 --> 01:31:19,566
I'll do it.

1811
01:31:19,634 --> 01:31:21,568
You're going to let him
kill himself?

1812
01:31:21,636 --> 01:31:23,237
Once he's dead,
why not?

1813
01:31:23,305 --> 01:31:25,640
You are the finest surgeon
I have ever known.

1814
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:29,377
You cannot throw your career,
your life away for this.

1815
01:31:29,444 --> 01:31:30,912
If you do this,
you're finished.

1816
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:33,114
What are they
going to do, sue me?

1817
01:31:33,181 --> 01:31:35,182
Disbar me?

1818
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:37,652
Evict me
from the country club?

1819
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,021
No, this is still a hospital.

1820
01:31:40,088 --> 01:31:42,189
If there's a heart available,

1821
01:31:42,257 --> 01:31:44,392
I'm not going to let it
go to waste.

1822
01:31:44,459 --> 01:31:47,696
Doctor, Mr. Maguire,
let's get ready for surgery.

WOMAN:
All right, hurry up, guys.

1826
01:32:21,098 --> 01:32:22,832
Get her on the table.

1827
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,067
WOMAN #2:
What's our time?

1828
01:32:24,134 --> 01:32:25,802
All right,
ready to lift.

1829
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:27,303
Count of three.

1830
01:32:27,371 --> 01:32:28,806

(SAW WHIRRING AND GRINDING)

1835
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:45,422
What do we have?

1836
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:48,392
WOMAN: Female donor,
26 years old...

1837
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:51,129
She is 26 years old, 5'7".

1838
01:32:51,197 --> 01:32:52,530
...kidneys usable.

1839
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:56,167
Liver and kidneys
are both usable. Lungs?

1840
01:32:56,235 --> 01:32:57,302
MAN: Okay.

1841
01:32:57,369 --> 01:32:58,937
Lungs are okay.
Heart?

1842
01:32:59,005 --> 01:33:00,438
Heart is good.

1843
01:33:00,506 --> 01:33:02,407
Heart is good.
Blood type?

1844
01:33:03,676 --> 01:33:05,477
B-positive.

1845
01:33:08,615 --> 01:33:10,749
This is my, uh...

1846
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,687
My will.

1847
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:18,257
It says I'm leaving my heart
to my son,

1848
01:33:18,325 --> 01:33:20,994
and I need two witnesses
to sign.

1849
01:33:21,061 --> 01:33:22,495
I'm not signing it.

1850
01:33:22,562 --> 01:33:24,130
I ain't going to watch you
kill yourself.

1851
01:33:24,197 --> 01:33:25,698
Me, neither.

1852
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:28,935
The sooner you sign it,
the sooner you go home.

1853
01:33:30,303 --> 01:33:32,739
Okay. I'll sign.

1854
01:33:32,806 --> 01:33:34,508
Me, too.

1855
01:33:44,185 --> 01:33:47,121
So you're just going to go
in there and off yourself?

1856
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:49,556
Only one thing
will stop me--

1857
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,458
if Mitch is b-positive.

1858
01:33:51,526 --> 01:33:55,095

You be good, huh?

1862
01:34:03,272 --> 01:34:04,939
Be careful.

just for a minute, okay?

I just need to tell you
a few things.

1878
01:35:38,138 --> 01:35:40,538
Okay, dad.

1879
01:35:44,645 --> 01:35:47,981
You always listen
to your mother.

1880
01:35:48,048 --> 01:35:50,183
You understand?

1881
01:35:50,251 --> 01:35:52,585
Do what she tells you
to do.

1882
01:35:55,156 --> 01:35:57,223
She's your best friend.

1883
01:35:57,291 --> 01:36:00,193
You tell her you love her
every day.

1884
01:36:00,261 --> 01:36:02,595
Okay, dad.

1885
01:36:03,597 --> 01:36:05,732
Now, you're--you're--

1886
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:08,869
you're too young for girls
right now, but...

1887
01:36:10,172 --> 01:36:13,073
There's
going to come a time.

1888
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:17,311
When it does, you treat them
like princesses,

1889

'cause that's what they are.

1890

When you say you're
going to do something...

01:36:42,071 --> 01:36:44,806
When you say you're going to
do something, you do it.

1892
01:36:46,876 --> 01:36:49,278
(WHISPERING)
Because your word is your bond, son.

1893
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:51,280
It's all you have.

1894
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:56,152
And money. You make money
if you get a chance,

1895
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:58,321
even if you got to sell out

will be here for you, too.

Good-bye.
