1
00:00:01,382 --> 00:00:03,315
That is a scary stack
of books.

2
00:00:04,162 --> 00:00:06,480
Does Mommy have
to read all those?

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,849
Of course.
That's what you do

4
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:10,217
when you go
to law school.

5
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:11,919
Read books and
argue with people.

6
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:13,253
Hey, what's going on?

7
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,255
We suddenly having
a bowl shortage?

8
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,424
We're just trying to save
our natural resources.

9
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:19,643
This way, we only have
to wash the spoons.

10
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:22,796
Okay, girls, shut that off.

11
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,681
Grab your homework. Bedtime.

12
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:31,338
Hello.

13
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,608
Yes, hi.
I'm looking for a young college coed.

14
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:36,777
A law student named
Allison Dubois?

15
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:38,612
Smooth, Joe College.

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,781
So, are you on the plane yet?

17
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:42,849
Yes, we just boarded.

18
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,669
Hey, listen, I wanted to try
one more time to convince you

19
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,088
that you don't need to
pick me up in the morning.

20
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:51,041
I think you should focus on
your first day of school.

21
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,793
Well, that's awful thoughtful
of you, Daddy,

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,796
but it's been six days since
I've laid eyes on you.

23
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:58,298
I can't wait to see that tan
that you got in Hawaii.

24
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:01,268
Hawaii?
Is that where I was?

25
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:03,437
All I remember is the inside
of a military base.

26
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:04,688
Hey, girls, it's Daddy.

27
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,373
You want to say good night?

28
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,841
Night, Dad!
See ya tomorrow!

29
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:08,875
Love you, Daddy!

30
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,410
Sweet dreams.

31
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:11,612
Did you get that?

32
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:14,081
Loud and clear.
I'll see you in the morning.

33
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:19,253
Yep. I'll be the one who looks
like a first-year law student.

34
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:29,563
Hello.

35
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,131
Hey, it's me.

36
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:34,101
I'm sorry to call so early.
We picked up a tailwind,

37
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:36,536
so we're landing at 5:00
instead of 6:00.

38
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:38,872
So I already called
for the car service,

39
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,174
so you just go back to sleep.

40
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:45,112
Honey? Honey, what?
I just lost you for a second.

41
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:46,780
Sorry.

42
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:49,583
We just hit some turbulence
or something. Hold on, babe.

43
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,485
PILOT
At this time I'm going

44
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:53,186
to ask you to fasten
your seatbelts.

45
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,821
Joe, what's going on?
Is everything okay?

46
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,723
Uh, everything's fine, sweetie.

47
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,027
Just a little bumpy.

48
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:04,364
Joe, what's going on?
Talk to me!

49
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,535
I love you, Allison!
I love you very...!

50
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,141

Today, the city of Phoenix
is presenting you

56
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:12,387
with an extraordinary
opportunity,

57
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:18,267
but it is also entrusting you
with a grave responsibility.

58
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:22,212
Luis Amenabar has been the head

59
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:26,132
of the Sola de Vega narcotics
cartel for over a decade.

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,517
And during that time,

61
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:31,170
he has ordered the execution
of dozens of men and women,

62
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:34,541
both here in Arizona
and in Mexico.

63
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:36,609
And then we go  into the list charges,

That's all right.

65
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:39,779
I just wanted to hear the
beginning. That's great!

66
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,314
That's really terrific.

67
00:03:41,382 --> 00:03:44,150
I'm glad I got you, got you
to take a pass at writing it.

68
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:46,319
Well, I tried to make
it sound like you.

69
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:47,737
Oh, man, you did.

70
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,456
Hell, you know what?

71
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:52,158
I'm half-tempted to just
let you do it yourself.

72
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:53,960
You're the D.A.

73
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:55,228
I'm only the second chair.

74
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:58,164
Believe me, the jury wants
to hear it from you.

75
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,684
We're really doing this,
aren't we?

76
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,147
We're gonna put that
son of a bitch away.

77
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,449
I think we are.

78
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:10,809
Get a good night's sleep.

79
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,560
Court's in session
at 1:00.

80
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:13,812
1:00? Why so late?

81
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,398
I asked the judge
for a continuance.

82
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:17,432
Tomorrow's an important day.

83
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:19,351
I wanted you

84
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,055
Well, thank you.

85
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,624
Marie?!

86
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:30,228
Honey, I'm home.
Sorry I'm late.

87
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:33,131
I got hungry
and I couldn't wait.

88
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,333
Your trial's all over
the news.

89
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,602
I DVR'd the coverage
if you wanted to watch it.

90
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,636
No, that's okay.

91
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:39,971
I'm living it.

92
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,741
It's about as much of that
trial as I can take.

93
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,542
So, listen, honey,

94
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,178
court doesn't start
till 1:00 tomorrow,

95
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,647
so I figured we'd drive out
to Wood Lawn in the morning.

96
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,983
Seriously?

97
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:54,586
Seriously.

98
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:57,822
It's the anniversary
of your father's death.

99
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,023
We should get out
to the cemetery.

100
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,925
I just don't get
what the point is.

101
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:03,995
It's not like Dad is
really at Wood Lawn.

102
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:06,865
Look, Mom,
I'm just saying--

103
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,001
okay?-- Dad's plane
went down in the Pacific.

104
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:12,904
We buried an empty coffin.

105
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:14,239
Doesn't it seem silly to you

106
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:16,508
to go see him every year
when he's not really there?

107
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:18,510
Marie, it's your father.

108
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:21,312
His grave is his grave.

109
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,283
Mom, I'm not going this year.

110
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,718
What?

111
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,354
I'm not going.

112
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:32,056
Dad died
seven years ago, Mom.

113
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,226
I cried about it
every night for how long?

114
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,962
Six months? A year?

115
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,498
And all that time,
he never showed up.

116
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:43,101
Never said goodbye.

117
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,371
Dad knows who we are.

118
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,107
He knows what we can do.

119
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:51,910
He didn't have to disappear from
our lives just because he died.

120
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,194
No. He chose to.

121
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,013
Sweetness... Sweetie...

122
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,448
Hey.

123
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:58,183
I'm sure he had his reasons.

124
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:01,486
Come on, Mom.

125
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:05,356
You're not even mad at him
just a little bit?

126
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:07,859
You never wondered
why he died and just...

127
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,761
left us?

128
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,810
Miss you.

129
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:35,487
These are from Ariel and Dave.

130
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:41,159
I can't believe
you never met Dave.

131
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:45,663
You know, I told Ariel
not to get married

132
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:48,199
until she graduated
law school, but...

133
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:52,637
Of course, she ignored me.

134
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,375
Just like
we ignored our parents.

135
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:02,780
From Bridgette.

136
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:06,451
Oh, she changed her major again.

137
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:09,754
It's Creative Writing this time.

138
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,561
From Marie.

139
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,931
She's a teenager now.

140
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:22,934
She's a good kid.

141
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:25,436
She'll be okay.

142
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,440
She just misses her dad.

143
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:37,715
I miss you, too.

144
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:43,738
Let's all do our best to keep
this from turning into a circus.

145
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:44,772
Shall we?

146
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,526
Be seated.

147
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,727
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

148
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:51,796
I'm required to remind you

149
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:54,132
that the defendant
is presumed innocent

150
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,701
until proven otherwise.

151
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,070
Good luck.

152
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,707
I hear
you're both quite good.

153
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:06,477
District Attorney Dennis Caruso

154
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,546
will handle opening statements
for the prosecution.

155
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,715
Mr. Caruso?

156
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:17,855
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, congratulations.

157
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:19,757
Today, the city of Phoenix

158
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:23,861
is presenting you with an
extraordinary opportunity.

159
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:25,930
<i>You want to hear something?</i>

160
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:28,533
Amenabar's attorney came to me
right after we adjourned.

161
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:29,968
Put a plea on the table.

162
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:32,370
They want to make a deal?
Why didn't you tell me?

163
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:33,821
Not worth discussing.

164
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:35,907
They offered to have him
plead guilty in Mexico.

165
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:39,010
We'd extradite him. He'd serve
a life sentence down there.

166
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:41,346
Problem is, is that
you know and I know

167
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,214
that he would
just keep running the show

168
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:44,749
from some
white collar prison.

169
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:47,752
and maybe bribe
his way out in a few years.

170
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,355
Like I said--
not worth discussing.

171
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:52,490
You should go home.
Have a drink.

172
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:54,375
Tomorrow morning, we'll keep
nailing him to the wall.

173
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,960
Tomorrow morning!

174
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:58,029
All right.

175
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,655
Mr. Mayor, can we
get a statement, please?

176
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,723
WOMAN 2: Will your office
be issuing a statement?

177
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,958
Mr. Mayor, any comment
on the slaying

178
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,927
of District Attorney Caruso?

179
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,679
Yes.
I have a comment.

180
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:24,830
I do.

181
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,967
Dennis Caruso was a friend.

182
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,770
Deputy Mayor DiNovi and I
respected him a great deal,

183
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:35,074
and our deepest sympathies go
out to his wife and daughters.

184
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:38,544
He said they wanted a deal.

185
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:42,148
That's... That's
the last thing he said to me.

186
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:49,322
He said
that Luis Amenabar's attorneys

187
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,457
wanted him extradited to Mexico

188
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,926
so that he could stand trial
there, and Dennis said "no."

189
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,731
Yeah, Maggie.

190
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,967
I'm sorry
to disturb you, Mr. Mayor,

191
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,935
but the Chief of Detectives
just arrived.

192
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,605
All right.
Send him in.

193
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,513
Hi.

194
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:20,619
Allison...

195
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,889
Do we know
anything new?

196
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,092
Security cameras
in the garage got nothing.

197
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,727
No one near
Caruso's car all day.

198
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,096
We're guessing the bomb
must have been planted

199
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,197
at some other location.

200
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,799
And no one's
officially taken credit

201
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,001
for what happened,
but, uh,

202
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,836
I think we all know
who's responsible.

203
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,404
Amenabar.

204
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,773
He wants us to know
he's still in control.

205
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,742
Would you two excuse us
for a moment, please?

206
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,976
Yeah.

207
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,919
Lynn's wrong.

208
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,222
Amenabar is not in control.

209
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,224
He wouldn't have done
what he did tonight

210
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,725
if he wasn't afraid.

211
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,329
I don't want him thinking
for even one second

212
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,831
that this is going to keep us
from sending him to prison.

213
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,700
I don't want him to think
for one second

214
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,902
that we're not going
to move forward with this trial.

215
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:15,041
I'd like you to think
about taking over for Dennis.

216
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,809
You built
this case.

217
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,477
There's no one
more equipped

218
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,479
to move this
forward than you.

219
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:24,350
If you tell me you'd rather not,
I won't hold it against you--

220
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:27,086
I'll even tell the media
it was my call--

221
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,423
but if you decide
to see this thing through,

222
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,392
then know that you,
Marie, Bridgette and Ariel

223
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,860
would have round-the-clock
protection

224
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,662
for the duration of this trial.

225
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,197
Amenabar's people
wouldn't be able

226
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,966
to get within 1,000 feet
of any of you.

227
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,270
The choice is yours.

228
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,311
Hey.

229
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,779
Mom, you okay?

230
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,164
I, uh...
I tried calling earlier,

231
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,083
but all I got
was your voice mail.

232
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,985
Listen, Ariel,
I need to tell you

233
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,621
about some things
that are going on here.

234
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,424
No. I understand.

235
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,992
You have to take over
first chair.

236
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,261
What... what other choice
is there?

237
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,163
I don't know.
I could have said no.

238
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,566
I could have let Mr. Devalos
hand the case over

239
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,733
to the interim
district attorney.

240
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,068
Okay.

241
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,137
But what kind of message
do you think that

242
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,473
would have sent to
the Luis Amenabars of the world?

243
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,942
I know. I'm just not crazy
about putting you

244
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,810
and your sisters
through all of this.

245
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,079
I just hate
that I can't do my job

246
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,882
without Mr. Devalos having
to put security details

247
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,417
on all three of you.

248
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,719
Mom, it's okay.

249
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,055
Seriously, we get it.

250
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,125
You know, Marie was so mad
at Daddy today.

251
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,961
She still can't forgive him
for not coming back.

252
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,263
And you know what? She's right.

253
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,565
He could come back
if he really wanted to.

254
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,300
He could tell me what to do.

255
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,554
Mom, what are you talking about?

256
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,339
I mean, he doesn't have to.

257
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,740
You know why?

258
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,244
Because we both already know
exactly what he would have said.

259
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,380
Make us proud.

260
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,144
♪ ♪

261
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:42,131
The sign that I saw
was in Spanish.

262
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:44,093
I'm almost positive
it was Mexico.

263
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,994
And I know how
this sounds--

264
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:47,963
Joe surviving this
plane crash--

265
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:49,565
but it is not impossible.

266
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:52,401
At least not according
to the FAA investigator

267
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:54,703
who analyzed this crash
seven years ago.

268
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:59,608
Look. You see this?

269
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:01,176
This is where
the plane went down.

270
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:02,444
And with the wind

271
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,146
and the strong
water currents that day,

272
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:06,682
Joe could have just drifted
to one of these beach towns,

273
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,351
like Rosarito or Ensenada.

274
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:11,153
If he survived the crash.

275
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:12,638
If he survived the crash.

276
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,224
Look, sir...

277
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,692
I know you have
connections

278
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,160
in Mexican law
enforcement.

279
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:20,629
I was just hoping maybe you
could reach out to them,

280
00:14:20,697 --> 00:14:23,499
see if maybe somebody remembers
seeing someone

281
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,768
matching Joe's description
washing up

282
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:28,070
on one of their beach towns
seven years ago.

283
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:29,404
Allison...

284
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:31,573
after my daughter,
Arianna, died,

285
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:35,711
there were times I swore
I saw her across a crowded room.

286
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,479
I heard her voice
right behind me.

287
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:39,281
This is not that.

288
00:14:39,349 --> 00:14:42,751
And you, of all people,
should know.

289
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:46,655
I've been having these dreams
my whole life,

290
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:51,126
and they almost always lead me
to something that matters.

291
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:54,797
Okay.

292
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,599
Okay.

293
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,134
I'll call my friends in Mexico.

294
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:01,003
I'll forward them
whatever photographs of Joe

295
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,905
you think would be most helpful.

296
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:04,306
Thank you.

297
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:05,908
<i>Mr. Ruiz,</i>

298
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:08,944
would you kindly identify
the men in this photograph?

299
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,713
Rico and Steban Treja.

300
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:14,283
And would you mind telling the
court how you know these men?

301
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,418
Because I killed them.

302
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:19,888
You killed them?

303
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:21,223
Why?

304
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,426
Because they were moving
into my territory,

305
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:28,063
trying to sell their merchandise
where they shouldn't have.

306
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:30,665
And when you say your territory,

307
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:34,136
don't you really mean
the Sola de Vega territory?

308
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:36,371
Sola de Vega,
the same narcotics cartel

309
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:37,706
that Luis Amenabar

310
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:40,943
has been running
for a little over a decade?

311
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,279
The same cartel that hired you

312
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:47,199
to execute their competitors
here in Phoenix

313
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:48,784
like the Treja brothers?

314
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:51,920
Well?

315
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:55,257
Your Honor.

316
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,326
Answer the question, Mr. Ruiz.

317
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:01,563
I killed the Treja brothers,
okay?

318
00:16:01,631 --> 00:16:03,131
I went to prison for it.

319
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,833
What else do you want me to say?

320
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,468
I want you to say what you said

321
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:08,703
to the police
the night you were arrested.

322
00:16:08,755 --> 00:16:11,974
I want you to say
that you were ordered

323
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:16,411
to execute the Trejas by someone
in Sola de Vega cartel.

324
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:20,766
And I want you
to identify the man

325
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,518
who gave you
that order personally.

326
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:26,755
No.

327
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:29,858
I was running
off my mouth.

328
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:31,627
I didn't take orders
from no one.

329
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:33,161
He's right here.

330
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,563
He's right behind that table.

331
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:46,475
Mrs. Dubois?

332
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:49,144
Would you care
to finish your thought?

333
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:55,684
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

334
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:58,987
I'm suddenly--
I'm not feeling very well.

335
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:01,556
I-I would like to request
a short recess.

336
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:04,192
Let's call it lunch.

337
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,828
We'll resume at 2:00.

338
00:17:08,564 --> 00:17:09,982
It's okay that
you're nervous.

339
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,400
Pardon me?

340
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,402
It's okay that
you're nervous.

341
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:15,370
It's a big case.

342
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:17,539
Mr. Amenabar, I really
don't think that your attorneys

343
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:19,041
will appreciate us talking

344
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:20,042
right now.

345
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,911
My lawyers do what I want.

346
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:26,515
I hear you're going
to be a grandmother.

347
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:30,652
Your oldest one, right, the
one that lives in Boston?

348
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,788
Believe it or not, I have
three little <i>nietos</i> myself.

349
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,959
They add years to your
life, Mrs. Dubois.

350
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:43,098
Hello.

351
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,967
Allison, I'm sorry
to bother you at home,

352
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:48,203
but I just heard back from the
last of my contacts in Mexico.

353
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:50,339
I'm afraid we've come up empty.

354
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:53,775
No one found any reports
of an injured man washing up

355
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:56,044
on a beach in the days
after Joe's plane went down.

356
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:58,013
I even had 'em search
the records for that whole year,

357
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,514
just to be sure.

358
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:02,617
I-I'm sorry, I know that's
not what you want to hear.

359
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:08,423
Your doctors called the station.

360
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:12,294
I just want to be sure
we get the story right.

361
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:13,695
So, according
to them,

362
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:17,733
you just woke up on
a beach two days ago.

363
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,504
You have no idea who you are,
no idea where you're from,

364
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:26,041
no clue how you
wound up in Mexico?

365
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,043
That's right.

366
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:30,545
I have a head injury.

367
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:32,614
My doctor...

368
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:36,251
I can't remember his name.

369
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,853
Dr. Aguilar.

370
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,855
Right,
Dr. Aguilar.

371
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:42,657
He says it may be permanent.

372
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:46,194
He doesn't know if I'll
ever get my memory back.

373
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:51,133
Please, I just want
to go home.

374
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,969
Okay, where
is home?

375
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:56,772
I don't know.

376
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,774
Can you help me?

377
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:00,409
Of course.

378
00:19:00,476 --> 00:19:01,743
Of course we can help you.

379
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:05,213
We're the police;
that's what we do.

380
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:10,185
You just listen to your
doctors for now, rest...

381
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:13,855
and I'll come
see you soon.

382
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:35,927
English.

383
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:37,179
I don't want my
driver chatting

384
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:39,181
to anybody
about this.

385
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,416
Fine.

386
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:43,885
The story we heard
is accurate.

387
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:46,221
He has no idea who he is,

388
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:49,825
and the doctors think
the brain damage is bad.

389
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:51,893
Hmm.

390
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:57,365
I appreciate your hard work.

391
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,950
Mr. Amenabar, gentlemen,

392
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:17,585
thank you for coming
on such short notice.

393
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:19,520
Your office is bringing
an additional charge

394
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:22,023
against our client, Mrs. Dubois.

395
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:23,958
I don't see
as we had much choice.

396
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:25,710
Well, then I assume
that you've explained

397
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:28,129
to Mr. Amenabar the
reason for which

398
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,898
he's being deposed
this morning.

399
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:32,267
It's in respect to a new
charge of kidnapping,

400
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:33,535
unrelated to any of those

401
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:36,037
for which you're already
being prosecuted.

402
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:38,256
Amelia Cready.

403
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,642
Her father is Steven
Cready of Cready Oil.

404
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:44,546
Two years ago Amelia was
kidnapped and held for ransom.

405
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:45,980
Per her kidnapper's request,

406
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:49,050
her father wired $2 million
to an offshore account

407
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:51,586
and awaited his
daughter's safe return.

408
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:55,690
All he got for his money was
the location of her body.

409
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:59,861
Now, last night I received
an anonymous tip--

410
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:01,496
Ah, anonymous.

411
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,264
Mm.

412
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,567
--that you were the one
who ordered the kidnapping.

413
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:10,538
I am sorry, I've never heard
of this girl or her father.

414
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:17,278
Well, Mr. Amenabar,
let's just pretend that you did.

415
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:18,546
Okay.

416
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:21,616
So this person who contacted us
also told us

417
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:23,785
the name of the man
who actually kidnapped Amelia.

418
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:26,254
We know what he looks like,
we have a picture of him.

419
00:21:26,322 --> 00:21:28,289
We just don't know
where to find him.

420
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:31,125
Now if you
are willing

421
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:33,228
to identify him,

422
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:36,097
tell us everything
that you know about him,

423
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,132
we might be willing

424
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,501
to not add this
to the list of charges

425
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,237
against you.

426
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:45,240
Why don't you take a look?

427
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:02,223
Gentleman, let me have a moment
alone with Mrs. Dubois, please.

428
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,893
Mr. Amenabar, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

429
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,561
There's guards
right outside the door.

430
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:09,030
You feel safe,
don't you, Mrs. Dubois?

431
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:30,184
Lawyers.
Hmm.

432
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:33,454
Do you play much poker?

433
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:35,556
No.

434
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:38,159
That's a shame,
because something tells me

435
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,428
that you'd be very good
at it if you did.

436
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:43,331
Mr. Amenabar, do you know the
man in this picture or not?

437
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:44,799
Ah.

438
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,101
You see what you just did,
looking away?

439
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:49,037
In poker, we call that a tell.

440
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:50,571
I know what a tell is.

441
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:52,140
And you did
the same thing to me

442
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:54,509
when you were telling me
all about the crime

443
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,811
that this man committed.

444
00:22:56,879 --> 00:23:00,181
It was almost as if
you didn't believe it yourself.

445
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,150
I wonder why that is.

446
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:04,485
Maybe it's just because
I don't like looking at you.

447
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:06,120
Nah.

448
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:08,389
It's not that.

449
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:10,591
I think it's something else.

450
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:13,127
I think, Mrs. Dubois,

451
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:15,129
that maybe...

452
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:17,665
you're the one
who knows this man.

453
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,568
Can you tell me
where to find him, or can't you?

454
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:22,770
<i>If</i> I could,

455
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:25,106
I don't think
either of us really believe

456
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:28,209
that you're looking
to arrest this man for murder.

457
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,514
Huh.

458
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:35,917
You know, now
that I take another look...

459
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:37,986
he does seem familiar.

460
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:43,691
Get me my extradition to Mexico,

461
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,461
and I'll tell you
exactly what you want to know.

462
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:49,564
Excuse me.
Just yesterday, you sat there,

463
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:52,467
and you told me this business
with Joe would not interfere

464
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:54,752
with your ability
to prosecute the Amenabar case.

465
00:23:54,837 --> 00:23:56,471
Now you're saying
that we should take the deal

466
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:57,638
his people are offering?

467
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:59,640
I thought you understood.

468
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:03,511
I saw my husband
in a Mexican hospital <i>alive.</i>

469
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:05,646
He has amnesia.

470
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:07,315
Amenabar paid a crooked cop

471
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:09,484
to bring him Joe
when he was released.

472
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:11,853
Okay, in the first place,
you didn't see it.

473
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,021
You dreamt it.

474
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:14,789
And in the second place,
why, Allison?

475
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,591
Please explain to me
why the head

476
00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:19,327
of a Mexican drug cartel
would buy a man with amnesia?

477
00:24:19,395 --> 00:24:20,628
Any man, much less Joe?

478
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:22,630
I don't know!
I just know that he did it.

479
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:25,233
I could see it in his eyes
when I saw him this morning.

480
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,834
This morning
when you fabricated the story

481
00:24:26,902 --> 00:24:29,303
about us bringing an additional
charge against him.

482
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:31,406
Do you realize you could have
put our entire case in jeopardy?

483
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:34,375
My <i>husband</i> is alive!

484
00:24:34,443 --> 00:24:37,311
And that is <i>all</i>
that matters now!

485
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:38,746
Listen to yourself, Allison.

486
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:41,015
It doesn't make any sense.

487
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,851
Joe survives a plane crash
from seven years ago?

488
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,520
He drifts to Mexico?

489
00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:47,088
He crosses paths

490
00:24:47,156 --> 00:24:48,489
with Luis Amenabar,

491
00:24:48,557 --> 00:24:50,091
the same man
you're prosecuting today?

492
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,193
I know how it sounds.

493
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:54,996
No, I don't think you do.

494
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:57,932
Did it ever occur to you
that Amenabar is playing you?

495
00:24:57,983 --> 00:24:59,567
The man runs
an organization larger

496
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:01,536
than most Fortune 500 companies.

497
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:03,004
He's no fool.

498
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:05,606
You said that you
could see in his eyes

499
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:06,841
that he knew Joe.

500
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:08,876
What do you think he sees
in <i>your</i> eyes?

501
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:10,411
Don't you think that maybe,
just maybe,

502
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,447
that Amenabar knows
that Joe means something to you?

503
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:13,781
Don't you think
that it's possible

504
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:15,983
that he's just telling you
what you want to hear?

505
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:18,352
He's not telling me
what I want to hear.

506
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,555
He's confirming what I know.

507
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:22,924
I saw Joe yesterday.

508
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:26,561
I saw him when I looked
at Amenabar in court.

509
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:29,063
Because they're connected.

510
00:25:29,098 --> 00:25:32,400
Because Amenabar can lead me
to Joe.

511
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:34,402
No, he can't,

512
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,938
and I won't make this deal.

513
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:41,809
Mr. Knox, you kept

514
00:25:41,877 --> 00:25:44,812
the books for the Sola de Vega
cartel, is that correct?

515
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,314
Uh, that's right.

516
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:48,015
And during the time

517
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,851
that you were acting
as their accountant,

518
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:52,420
you were frequently asked
to enter expenses under

519
00:25:52,488 --> 00:25:54,088
the miscellaneous supplies
category.

520
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:55,756
Is that right?

521
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:57,492
Uh, yes.

522
00:25:57,543 --> 00:25:59,494
And yet, you understood

523
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:01,546
that those expenses
were for something other

524
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,598
than miscellaneous supplies,
didn't you?

525
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:08,769
You already answered

526
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:10,338
this question
when we deposed you

527
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:11,889
in exchange for immunity.

528
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:14,942
If you prefer,
I could read it into the record.

529
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,544
No.

530
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:19,780
All of the book entries
were in code.

531
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:21,516
They had to be that way.

532
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:22,984
The men I worked for...

533
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:25,052
they told me that
miscellaneous supplies meant

534
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,688
money they spent
when they had someone murdered.

535
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:31,742
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

536
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:36,230
My apologies.

537
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:40,251
Where did you get this?
Get what?

538
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:41,435
Counsel, what's going on?

539
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:42,870
Where is he?
Where's my husband?

540
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:44,438
- Counsel!
- Where's Joe?!

541
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:46,807
Counsel,

542
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,310
you will come to order,
or you will be held in contempt.

543
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:50,778
I'm calling a recess.

544
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:52,880
I want to see counsel
from both sides

545
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:54,932
in my chambers
immediately.

546
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:02,657
Allison,
sorry to ring your bell so late,

547
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:05,092
but there's something
I need to discuss with you.

548
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:12,333
You're replacing me
as lead counsel?

549
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:14,335
Allison...

550
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:16,337
whatever you're going through,

551
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:18,339
it's affecting our chances
of convicting Amenabar.

552
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:21,342
We can't afford another day
like you had today.

553
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,879
But, sir,
Amenabar knows where Joe is.

554
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:27,248
He showed me a picture of him,
a photograph.

555
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:28,549
I heard all about it,

556
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:30,685
but it doesn't prove anything,
Allison.

557
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:32,353
Amenabar knows
you're vulnerable,

558
00:27:32,421 --> 00:27:34,188
and he's using it
to fluster you.

559
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:36,290
I've told Judge Malone
we're bringing in new counsel.

560
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:37,892
She's granted us a 48-hour stay.

561
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,260
I'm sorry.

562
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:40,528
You've done exceptional work,

563
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:42,530
but someone else is going
to take it from here.

564
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:43,698
WOMAN
<i>And a surprising</i>

565
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,866
turn of events in Phoenix today,

566
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:48,636
as lead prosecutor
in the Luis Amenabar trial,

567
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:51,572
Allison Dubois,
was asked to step down.

568
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,574
Asked for comment,

569
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:55,660
Mayor Manuel Devalos
would only say

570
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:59,413
that the A.D.A. was taking
a leave for personal reasons.

571
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:14,528
Danny Boy.

572
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:15,713
<i>¿Qué tal?</i>

573
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:17,431
Hey, Eduardo.

574
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:19,383
You made some good time, amigo.
Yeah.

575
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:21,352
I brought you some tacos.

576
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,271
Oh, no, no.
In case you were hungry?

577
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:25,973
No, no, it's okay. I got
something on the road, so...

578
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:28,943
I was just listening
on the radio about Mr. Amenabar.

579
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,812
It sounds like things are going
a little better for him.

580
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:33,814
Those people in Phoenix--

581
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:35,750
they don't know what
they're talking about.

582
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:38,085
Mr. Amenabar is a good man.

583
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:39,987
If he wasn't,

584
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:42,390
I would have put him in
jail a long time ago, no?

585
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:44,125
Yeah.

586
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:46,744
Are you okay? You look, uh...
you look tired.

587
00:28:46,828 --> 00:28:49,297
No. I'm not tired.

588
00:28:49,364 --> 00:28:51,265
I just...

589
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,934
I was just having a hard time
sleeping last night.

590
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:56,270
I... I kept having this dream.

591
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:58,889
This... this blonde woman.

592
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:02,043
Ah. I had that
dream, amigo.

593
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,761
Yeah.
I know that woman.

594
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:05,513
It wasn't like that.

595
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,515
No. What was it like?

596
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:09,583
Ah, I don't know.

597
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:13,521
It was just nice.

598
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:16,257
We had a house.

599
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:20,127
I think we were married, because
there were three daughters.

600
00:29:20,195 --> 00:29:22,863
Three girls that we had.

601
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:24,932
And they looked like her.

602
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:28,869
Been having that dream
a lot lately.

603
00:29:28,937 --> 00:29:30,604
Kind of makes me wonder...

604
00:29:30,672 --> 00:29:32,173
About what?

605
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,810
I don't know. About my accident,
my memory loss.

606
00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:38,679
I'm trying to figure out

607
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:41,048
if maybe she was someone
that I knew before.

608
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:43,617
Look, I don't know what
to tell you, Danny.

609
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:45,453
I'm the one who
caught your case

610
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,822
when you washed up on
that shore that day.

611
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:49,590
And I'm the one
who figured out

612
00:29:49,658 --> 00:29:52,827
that you worked for Mr.
Amenabar before you got hurt.

613
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:55,963
So, I probably know more
about you than you do.

614
00:29:56,031 --> 00:29:57,431
Uh.

615
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:59,600
I'm going to tell
you right now.

616
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:02,636
You ain't never
been with no blonde.

617
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:05,373
You sure as hell
don't have no family.

618
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,122
Allison.

619
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:24,792
It's 6:30 in the morning.

620
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,293
What are you doing here? I...

621
00:30:26,361 --> 00:30:28,896
I thought we both agreed
you'd take a little time off.

622
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:30,865
We did. And I am.

623
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:32,666
Joe's alive.

624
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:35,269
I met with Luis Amenabar.
He confirmed it.

625
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:37,438
You met with Amenabar?

626
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:38,773
He's been using Joe

627
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,975
as a drug mule
for the last seven years.

628
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:43,411
A friendly American face
that can go back and forth

629
00:30:43,478 --> 00:30:46,213
across the Mexican border
without arousing suspicion.

630
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:47,982
Joe doesn't understand.

631
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:50,951
He thinks he's just been
running errands for Amenabar.

632
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:52,386
He doesn't realize

633
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:54,321
those cars are filled
with compartments

634
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:56,090
that hold narcotics.

635
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:58,259
I see.

636
00:30:58,326 --> 00:31:01,695
Now, assuming all of this
is true, why do you think

637
00:31:01,763 --> 00:31:04,432
Amenabar would suddenly be
so forthcoming about Joe?

638
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,738
Sir, I came here

639
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:14,275
because I wanted to apologize
for my behavior yesterday.

640
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:18,179
You have always been
a good friend to me,

641
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:21,449
and I'm very grateful,
and I wanted you to know that.

642
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:23,951
Allison.

643
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:26,620
You haven't answered
my question.

644
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:28,572
Why would Amenabar tell you
about Joe?

645
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:30,624
Take care of yourself, sir.

646
00:31:32,744 --> 00:31:34,829
Allison!

647
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:41,402
Allison!

648
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,553
Hello?

649
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,922
How far away
from City Hall are you?

650
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:47,174
I'm right... I'm right outside.
What's going on, Lynn?

651
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:49,042
Well, apparently,
Allison Dubois had a meeting

652
00:31:49,094 --> 00:31:51,178
with Amenabar and his attorneys
late last night.

653
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:53,247
She agreed
to the extradition deal.

654
00:31:53,315 --> 00:31:56,016
Her only condition was that
she get a five-minute meeting

655
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,518
with Amenabar in private.

656
00:31:57,586 --> 00:31:59,420
It's over, Manny.

657
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,956
They're flying him to Mexico
this afternoon.

658
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:04,575
She torpedoed the case.

659
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:17,514
<i>Are really going</i>
<i>to do this?</i>

660
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,970

talk to me the whole way?

661
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,253
Just don't, okay?

662
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:22,871
Don't what?

663
00:32:22,956 --> 00:32:24,823
Don't act like
this is just some road trip

664
00:32:24,874 --> 00:32:28,127
and everything is totally
normal, because it's not.

665
00:32:28,194 --> 00:32:31,230
You threw away your career
this morning.

666
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,916
You threw away your life.

667
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,300
You threw away my life.

668
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:37,086
My friends. My school.

669
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,370
Why would you do that?

670
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:40,606
I did it to save our family.

671
00:32:40,674 --> 00:32:43,175
Yeah. You just keep
telling yourself that.

00:35:54,734 --> 00:35:57,502
the one I was taking
back from Hawaii,

708
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,706
something went wrong
with one of the engines.

709
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:09,147
No.

710
00:36:09,215 --> 00:36:11,250
No, no.
No, this is... That's...

711
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:12,584
This isn't right.

712
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:13,986
This... That can't be right.

713
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:15,153
It is.

714
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:17,122
I didn't make it, Allison.

715
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,291
None of us made it.

716
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,726
I'm so sorry.

717
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:23,328
Stop saying that.

718
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:25,364
Do you hear me?

719
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:26,698
I-I want to wake up now.

720
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:29,034
I want to wake up
and find you beside me.

721
00:36:29,102 --> 00:36:30,202
I want to hold you.

722
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,238
I'd like that, too,

723
00:36:33,306 --> 00:36:36,208
but you're not going to
wake up from this, Allison.

724
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:37,743
This isn't a dream.

725
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,979
The dream was everything
you just went through.

726
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:47,686
No!

727
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:50,589
I sent it to you.

728
00:36:50,657 --> 00:36:54,893
I was trying to show you
how things could be.

729
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:57,429
I was trying to show you
that, in spite of this,

730
00:36:57,497 --> 00:36:59,731
you could still have
an amazing life.

731
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,600
That you could
be a lawyer.

732
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:04,436
That the girls could
turn out great.

733
00:37:04,504 --> 00:37:07,773
I wanted you to see
how happy you could be,

734
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,609
but something happened.

735
00:37:10,677 --> 00:37:12,978
You took over somehow.

736
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:17,182
Even in a dream, you couldn't
accept that I was gone,

737
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,850
so you brought
me back to life.

738
00:37:18,918 --> 00:37:21,687
You, Allison.

739
00:37:21,754 --> 00:37:23,722
You made it so that
you'd find me in Mexico.

740
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:27,359
You made it so that we
could be together again.

741
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:29,428
But we can't.

742
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:31,964
Because things like that
only happen in dreams.

743
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:37,369
This is going
to be hard.

744
00:37:37,437 --> 00:37:38,887
This is going
to be awful,

745
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:41,273
and it's going to be
awful for a long time,

746
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,475
but you will get past it.

747
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:47,646
Everything we have
built, our life,

748
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:50,082
you'll keep it
going without me.

749
00:37:51,918 --> 00:37:54,286
I can't. I can't.

750
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:58,924
I need you, Joe.

751
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:03,228
Who's gonna walk Ariel down the
aisle when she gets married?

752
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:09,167
Who's gonna get Bridgette and
Marie through being teenagers?

753
00:38:10,236 --> 00:38:11,770
Who's going to...

754
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,874
Who's going to talk to me
at night before I fall asleep?

755
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:23,181
You and me...

756
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:27,552
we've been together
for-for so long

757
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,922
I don't even know if there
is a "me" without you.

758
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,059
There is.

759
00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:36,361
I'm not just saying that.

760
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:37,996
I've seen it.

761
00:38:45,972 --> 00:38:48,073
I love you, Allison.

762
00:38:48,141 --> 00:38:50,842
I'll always love you.

763
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,477
Never forget that.

764
00:38:52,545 --> 00:38:56,114
Please, my love.

765
00:38:56,182 --> 00:38:58,116
Please. I love you.
Don't leave me.

766
00:38:58,184 --> 00:38:59,985
Please!

767
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:02,654
Please, please!

768
00:39:02,722 --> 00:39:06,024
Don't leave me. Please stay.

769
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:15,667
GIRL
Hi, Great-Grandma.

770
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:17,803
It's me. Glimmer.

771
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,173
I haven't seen you
since Christmas.

772
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,875
Do you remember
what I look like?

773
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:27,746
I worry you won't know it's me,

774
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:32,084
'cause I'm taller now.

775
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:34,086
How's the weather there?

776
00:39:34,153 --> 00:39:37,689
It's cold here.

777
00:39:37,757 --> 00:39:40,959
Every time it snows,

778
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,962
Mommy laughs.

779
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:48,433
She says when she was my age,
she would dream about snow.

780
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:53,305
Did Mommy tell you I'm having a
Sleeping Beauty birthday party?

781
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:55,674
All my friends are going
to sleep over,

782
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:58,643
and we're going to have
birthday cake for breakfast.

783
00:40:00,213 --> 00:40:02,781
Do you think
you'll be able to come?

784
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,250
You can help me blow out...

785
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,970
Oh, no.

786
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,351
Hi.

787
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:48,326
You waited.

788
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:53,632
Of course.

789
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:55,634
You ready?

790
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:02,741
Do I get a kiss?

791
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:11,049
From now until
the end of time.

792
