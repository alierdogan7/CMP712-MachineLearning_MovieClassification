{clock chimes}

1
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,276
Leave the cell door open.
Let him escape.

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,030
lt's all very irregular. lt might entail
the most embarrassing repercussions.

3
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,630
Exactement. lt's a responsibility
of the first magnitude.

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,275
- Mr Wilson, you must see...
- Blast all this discussion.

5
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,518
What good are words? l'm sick of words.
Hang the repercussions.

6
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,952
lf l fail l am responsible.
Leave the cell door open. Let him escape.

7
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,710
lt's our only chance. Let them
threaten me with hell and still l insist.

8
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,868
This obscenity must be destroyed.
Do you hear me? Destroyed:

9
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,990
Todos los pasajeros desembarquen.

10
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,032
All passengers ready to disembark.

11
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,311
l am travelling for my health.

12
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,557
Tengan listos sus pasaportes.

13
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,830
Get your passports ready.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,434
l am travelling for my health.

15
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,716
- ? Sus negocios en este pais, senora?
- {woman} Je n'ai pas compris.

16
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,276
- l don't understand.
- Your business in this country?

17
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,356
l'm joining my husband.

18
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,196
Next, please.

19
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,510
Stefan Polaski.

20
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,712
- You take care of him.
- Your business in this country?

21
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,877
- l'm travelling for my health.
- How?

22
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,680
- l am travelling for my health.
- You are a native of what country?

23
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,191
- Poland.
- Oh, Poland. Grata permanencia.

24
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,276
Next, please.

25
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,994
-Que pasü?

26
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,192
Yo lo voy a seguir a pie, tı ve en el carro.

27
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,798
-Çotel Nacional? 7702.

{phone rings}

29
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,519
Hello?

30
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,392
Yes.

31
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,594
You're sure you know where he's going?

32
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,996
My wife is following him.
He's going to the photographer's.

33
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,590
Probably to get a new passport
and new instructions.

34
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,875
Hold it.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,357
l wish to know the whereabouts
of Franz Kindler.

36
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,436
Franz Kindler.

37
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,754
There is no Franz Kindler.
Franz Kindler is dead. And cremated.

38
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,836
lt's incorrect:

39
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,235
l have a message for Franz Kindler.
From the All Highest.

40
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,351
lt is... forbidden.

41
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,711
l command you
in the name of that authority.

42
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,677
You know the name he is using?

43
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,230
Connecticut.

44
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,911
ln the United States. The town of Harper.

45
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,517
Harper.

46
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,551
Oh...

47
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,236
Excuse me.

48
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,634
- {radio}
- {man laughing}

49
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,320
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

50
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,273
- Have a nice trip?
- Yes, thank you.

51
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,313
Quite a store you have here, Mr...

52
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,237
- Potter.
- That's me.

53
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,920
We sell about everything here.

54
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,996
{laughs}

55
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,839
This suitcase. l could leave it here?

56
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,509
The bag?
l don't assume no responsibility.

57
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,077
Just put it up on the shelf.
lt'll be there when you want it.

58
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,873
- Can l buy this magazine?
- That'll be a dime.

59
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,755
- What's the best hotel in town?
- Best place is down at Mrs Peabody's.

60
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,838
lt's just down the road here a piece.

61
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,238
- This way, mister.
- Yes. Thank you.

62
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,156
{horn}

63
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,796
l may come in?

64
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,876
Yes, of course.

65
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,029
- Does Mr Charles Rankin live here?
- Yes, but he isn't here right now.

66
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,516
- Are you expecting him?
- Yes, in a few minutes.

67
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,517
How soon?

68
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,791
Well... a few minutes.

69
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,876
A few minutes.

70
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,116
l may...

71
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,555
l may wait here?

72
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,395
Well, yes, if you like.

73
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,751
- Would you like to sit down?
- Thank you.

74
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,435
- Are you a friend of Mr Rankin's?
- Yes, a friend.

75
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,712
- l'm Mary Longstreet. How do you do?
- How do you do?

76
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,196
Mr Rankin ought to be here now.
Sometimes he stays after his last class,

77
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,279
but he'll come straight here today.
This is our wedding day.

78
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,598
- You are getting married?
- Yes. At six o'clock.

79
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,558
l know it's unconventional my being here
today, but l want to get these curtains up.

80
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,917
When he comes,
which way does he come?

81
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,873
Why, from Webster Hall.

82
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,594
lt's the big dome building right over there.

83
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,676
Thank you.

84
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,590
Who shall l say that...?

85
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,036
Franz.

86
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,637
lt's l, Franz.

87
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,797
Meinike. We mustn't
be seen talking together.

88
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,356
Go back to the church.
lnto the woods, you understand?

89
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,677
Follow the path. l'll meet you there.

90
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,271
- Hello, Professor Rankin.
- Hello, men. What are you up to?

91
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,834
- Paper chase.
- l lay the trail.

92
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,997
You ought to have Jerry's job.
Trim that waistline.

93
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,951
- You should go with us.
- Where to?

94
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,435
- The woods.
- Hiya, blondie.

95
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:14,072
The woods? l'd like to. l'm afraid
l have a couple of things to attend to.

96
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,714
- Join us later.
- All right.

97
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,796
We'll catch up with you.

98
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,076
This way, fellas.

99
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,990
- Meinike.
- Yes, Meinike.

100
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,678
- l thought...
- l had been hanged.

101
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,916
The others, but not l.

102
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,477
A dead man could not stand
face to face with you, Franz.

103
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,871
You're not much changed.

104
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,515
Put you back in your old uniform,
you'd look very much the same.

105
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,474
- l am a different man than before.
- l too.

106
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,510
l too am different, Konrad.

107
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,599
l destroyed every item in Germany
and Poland that might reveal my identity.

108
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,473
Guess what l'll be doing at six tonight?

109
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,353
Standing before a minister of the gospel

110
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,790
with the daughter of a justice
of the US Supreme Court.

111
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,948
The girl's even good to look at.
The camouflage is perfect.

112
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,358
Who would think to look for the notorious
Franz Kindler in the Harper School,

113
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,836
surrounded by the sons of
America's first families?

114
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,796
And l'll stay hidden...
till the day when we strike again.

115
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,037
Franz: There will be another war?

116
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,756
Of course.

117
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,877
War is an abomination, saith the Lord.
lt is to tell you this that l am here.

118
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,391
- He set me free that l might come here...
- Set you free? Who set you free?

119
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,476
The All Highest.

120
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,517
- You don't mean...?
- l mean God.

121
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,637
- God:
- Franz.

122
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,719
- l am a new man since l found him.
- You, Konrad. Religious:

123
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,868
Franz, all doors were opened to me.
All doors.

124
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,355
lt was one of God's miracles.

125
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,396
Mm-hm.

126
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,190
They freed you so you'd lead them to me.

127
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,312
Have you been followed?
Were you followed here?

128
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,556
- Yes.
- Who followed you?

129
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,398
The evil one.

130
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,229
He looked like any other man.
He was dressed like any other man.

131
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,191
He even smoked a pipe.

132
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,313
But l recognised him through his disguise,
and l killed him.

133
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,795
Struck him from on high down.

134
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,516
God's will be done.

135
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,359
You killed him, the man with the pipe?

136
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,516
The man who followed you?

137
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,910
No one else followed you?

138
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,076
Mm-hm.

139
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,117
You must be brought to salvation, Franz.
Confess your sins as l have.

140
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,995
Proclaim your guilt.
Only thus you can attain salvation.

141
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,873
- You really think so, Konrad?
- lt will take strength.

142
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,151
Such strength as can come
only from God.

143
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,316
Kneel by me, Franz.

144
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,479
And together we will pray to him
to give you strength.

145
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,789
l have sinned against heaven
and before thee.

146
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,193
l am not worthy to be called thy son.

147
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,716
Say these words after me.

148
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,910
l despair of my sins.

149
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,956
l despair of my sins.

150
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,510
- O God of all goodness.
- O God...

151
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,395
- How could l ever have offended thee?
- ..of all goodness.

152
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,076
This way, fellas:
Don't let him get away.

153
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,276
Hey, fellas, there's the trail.
Hurry up.

154
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,516
This way, fellas.

155
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,748
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God

156
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,949
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

157
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,316
..and, forsaking all others, keep thee only
unto her so long as ye both shall live?

158
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,668
l will.

159
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,473
Mary, wilt thou have this man
for thy husband,

160
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,958
to live together after God's ordinance
in the holy estate of matrimony?

161
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,712
Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honour
and keep him in sickness and in health,

162
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,868
and, forsaking all others, keep thee only
unto him so long as ye both shall live?

163
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,955
l will.

164
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,840
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

165
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,559
- Wedding?
- Yep. Judge Longstreet's daughter.

166
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,831
He's Supreme Court justice, you know.

167
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,956
- Bottle of aspirin, please.
- Back there, third shelf down.

168
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,914
You'll see the big ones on the left,
the economy size.

169
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,589
Have to get it yourself, mister.
Right back there.

170
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,192
All your needs are on our shelves.
Just look around, help yourselves.

171
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,596
Right in there. That's it.

172
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,077
- Livin' down at Mrs Peabody's?
- Just a few days only.

173
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,795
Coffee too, please.
Or should l get it myself?

174
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,391
- Cafeteria style around here, mister.
- That's right. Self-service.

175
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,275
- The usual, Frank.
- That's three dollars even, Mr Todd.

176
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,273
- No limit on the cream?
- All the people around here take it black.

177
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,913
- The one on the right.
- Thank you.

178
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,757
- Who is Miss Longstreet marrying?
- One of the teachers.

179
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,156
- A stranger in town.
- l issued the licence.

180
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,430
Yep. l'm town clerk.

181
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,112
Uh...

182
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,959
- Checkers?
- All right.

183
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,871
Town clerk, huh?
That must be quite a responsibility.

184
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,037
Town clerk runs the town, you might say.

185
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,199
We usually make it for... 1 5, 20...

186
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,919
We often play as high as
25 cents the game.

187
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,634
Well, that's kinda stiff for me, but...

188
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,151
- Make a million, lose a million.
- That's the way it goes.

189
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,836
- My move?
- Hm?

190
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,796
All right.

191
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,559
You must know just about
everybody in town here.

192
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,797
Not just about. Know everybody.

193
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,151
- Here on business?
- Mm-hm.

194
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,031
- School business?
- Mm-mm.

195
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,589
- Sellin' something?
- Mm-mm.

196
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,796
Buyin'?

197
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,109
Oh, antique dealer.
They all come to Harper.

198
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,992
Judge Longstreet's got the best collection.

199
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,270
l don't suppose he'd sell.

200
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,513
Happen to know if there are
any other out-of-town buyers here?

201
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,191
Let me see... Come to think of it,
there was a fella come in this morning.

202
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,515
Came on the same bus with you.

203
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,829
Left his suitcase here.
Never did come back for it.

204
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,394
He might have been one of them.

205
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,591
No. He was more the missionary type.

206
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,510
Wasn't in long. Looked in the phone book.
Tiny little fella, he was.

207
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,916
Thinnish. Unfortunate-looking.

208
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,314
- Hurt your head?
- No, nothing serious.

209
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,113
Oh, that's too bad.

210
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,750
lt's a game you got to
keep your mind on. Hah:

211
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,391
25 cents, please.

212
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,477
Hello, Father. Has anybody seen
my brand-new husband?

213
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,036
- Don't tell me he's deserted you already.
- Looks as if, the brute.

214
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,469
Red, have you seen Charles?

215
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,353
Go find him for me. Hurry up.

216
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,514
l've looked everywhere for him.

217
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,997
- l'm getting worried.
- Are you, darling? What about?

218
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,157
Charles... You've changed.

219
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,428
Don't you think you'd better?

220
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,677
After all, aren't we supposed to be
going on a honeymoon?

221
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,756
Give me five minutes.

222
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,275
- Hello there.
- Hello.

223
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,878
- Was that you working on the clock?
- No. l was just cleaning around it.

224
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,788
lt's a beautiful thing,
from what l can see out front.

225
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,230
- My name's Wilson.
- Noah Longstreet.

226
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,590
l'm glad to know you.

227
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,599
l couldn't judge too well out front,
but l'd say it was 16th century.

228
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,473
Probably by Haabrecht of Strassburg.

229
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,239
- The clock.
- l wouldn't know.

230
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,079
My brother-in-law's going to work on it.

231
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,670
- ls he up there now?
- No, he's on his honeymoon.

232
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,678
He plans to work on it when he gets back.

233
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,873
- ls he an expert?
- Yes, but it's more of a hobby with him.

234
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,118
Really? Well, it is with me too.

235
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,949
- Honeymoon?
- Yes. He and my sister.

236
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,072
He has to be back on Friday
because of the examinations.

237
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,191
He's one of the teachers at the school.

238
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,433
- His name is Rankin.
- Oh?

239
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,119
lt's nice to show it to someone who
knows what Revere silver's all about.

240
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,473
- Personally, my specialty is pewter.
- Oh, yes. Pewter.

241
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,116
The Revere workmanship,
although sometimes heavy in design,

242
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,552
almost invariably shows
the sign of a master craftsman.

243
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,557
lt is beautiful.

244
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,069
- Noah.
- Hello, Mary.

245
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,077
- Adam.
- Hello, Mary, dear.

246
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,350
Mr Wilson, my daughter Mary.

247
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,710
My son-in-law, Charles Rankin.

248
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,071
l hope you don't mind
my intruding on your homecoming.

249
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,714
- Good evening, Mary.
- Jeff, how are you?

250
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,434
- You're looking good.
- Welcome home, Miss Mary.

251
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,516
Sara:

252
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,398
lf you don't sit down it'll get cold.

253
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,710
- How were the mountains?
- Marvellous.

254
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,834
Mr Wilson, will you sit on my right?
Jeff, your usual place. Darling, right there.

255
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,714
You ought to see Charles on skis.
He's wonderful.

256
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,149
- l'm pretty good too, aren't l?
- Very.

257
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,831
- Did you keep your knees together?
- Yes, freshy, l did.

258
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,509
Mr Wilson here is compiling
a catalogue of Paul Revere silver.

259
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,598
- How nice.
- He's also an authority on clocks.

260
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,871
- That's Charles' hobby too.
- So your brother tells me.

261
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,992
You're going to fix
the one in the church tower?

262
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,159
- l may try.
- That's quite an undertaking.

263
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,191
l hope he fails.

264
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,438
l like Harper just the way it is,
even with a clock that doesn't run.

265
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,518
Have you been in Harper long, Mr Wilson?

266
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,995
Since... Friday, a week ago.

267
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,158
You lost a day.
l patched you up on Friday.

268
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,590
- How's the head?
- Much improved, thanks to you, Doctor.

269
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,837
You were hurt on Thursday.
The day of the wedding.

270
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,829
Yes, that's right. Wednesday l left Bangor.

271
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,158
- You were hurt, Mr Wilson?
- Nothing serious.

272
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,114
Serious enough to raise a bump
on his head the size of a billiard ball.

273
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,196
The usual door.

274
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,799
Good thing you're back.
That dog of yours has been inconsolable.

275
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,630
All right, Red, here you are.
This is for missing me. Good boy.

276
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,957
- How was your meeting, Adam?
- lrritating.

277
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,311
- The Foreign Policy Association.
- l read that report.

278
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,398
- Standish.
- l think he's full of prunes.

279
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,512
That's the way we used to talk
in the 1 930s, Noah.

280
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,428
- Standish?
- The London Times man in Berlin.

281
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,518
Of course he was
quoting rumours, mostly.

282
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,794
Men drilling by night. Underground
meeting places. Pagan rituals.

283
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,071
- Do you believe him?
- Well, anything's possible.

284
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,154
l'm sorry, sir, but l think it's ridiculous.

285
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,913
Besides some fanatics, no German in his
right mind can still have a taste for war.

286
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,400
Do you know Germany, Mr Rankin?

287
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,196
l'm sorry, l...

288
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,318
l have a way of making enemies when
l'm on that subject. l get pretty unpopular.

289
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,514
Well, we shall consider it the objective
opinion of an objective historian.

290
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,475
Historian? A psychiatrist
could explain it better.

291
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,388
The German sees himself as
the innocent victim of envy and hatred -

292
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,389
conspired against, set upon
by inferior peoples, inferior nations.

293
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,229
He cannot admit to error,
much less to wrongdoing.

294
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,351
We ignored Ethiopia and Spain,

295
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,790
but we learned
the price of looking the other way.

296
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,358
Men of truth have come to know for
whom the bell tolled, but not the German.

297
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,712
He still follows his warrior guards,
marching to Wagnerian strains,

298
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,435
his eyes still fixed upon
the fiery sword of Siegfried.

299
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,917
ln those meeting places you don't
believe in, his dream world comes alive.

300
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,239
He takes his place in armour beneath
the banners of the Teutonic knights.

301
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,909
Mankind is waiting for the Messiah,
but for the German

302
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,998
the Messiah is not the prince of peace.

303
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,433
He's another Barbarossa.

304
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,757
Another Hitler.

305
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,678
Then you have no faith in the reforms
being effected in Germany?

306
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,148
l don't know. l can't believe that people
can be reformed except from within.

307
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,034
The principles of equality and freedom
never have taken root there.

308
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,038
The will to freedom
is voiced in every other tongue.

309
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,280
''All men are created equal.'' ''Liberte,
egalite, fraternite. '' But in German...

310
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,155
There's Marx. ''Proletarians unite. You
have nothing to lose but your chains.''

311
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,953
But Marx wasn't a German.
Marx was a Jew.

312
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,756
My dear Charles, if we concede
your argument, there is no solution.

313
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,236
- Sir, once again, l differ.
- What is it, then?

314
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,231
Annihilation. To the last babe in arms.

315
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,309
l can't imagine you're advocating
a Carthaginian peace.

316
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,754
Well, the world hasn't had much trouble
from Carthage in the past 2,000 years.

317
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,235
There speaks our pedagogue.

318
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,916
- Speaking of teachers...
- Yes?

319
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,558
The faculty is coming for tea on Tuesday.
Would you like to join us?

320
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,717
l'd like to, but my work here is finished.

321
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,159
l'm leaving Harper tomorrow.

322
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,317
Extraordinary, clocks being
Mr Wilson's hobby too.

323
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,396
Yes. lsn't it?

324
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,637
- Red, how do you like your new house?
- He loves it.

325
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,389
- Think l'll take you for a walk.
- Just let him out. He won't run off.

326
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,114
l need the walk. l'm restless.
Come on, boy.

327
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,837
That's good. Çow are you coming along?

328
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,273
l'll be in Washington tomorrow afternoon.
You were right about Rankin.

329
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,356
He's above suspicion.

330
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,956
Here, Red.

331
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,756
Red, come here.

332
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,796
Give me long distance.

333
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,956
l want Washington, DC.

334
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,836
Who but a Nazi would deny that Karl Marx
was a German, because he was a Jew?

335
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,837
l think l'll stick around for a while.

336
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,354
What is it, dear?

337
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,198
Oh.

338
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,596
l'm sorry. l was dreaming.

339
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,870
About that little man.

340
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,480
What little man?

341
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,751
You know, dear. l told you about him.

342
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,838
He came here the day we were married.

343
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,160
Light me a cigarette, will you?

344
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,635
l've never had a dream like that before.
lt frightened me.

345
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,836
Thanks.

346
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:10,798
The little man was walking all by himself
across a deserted city square.

347
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,237
Wherever he moved, he threw a shadow.

348
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,279
But when he moved away, Charles,

349
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,032
his shadow stayed there behind him
and spread out just like a carpet.

350
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,599
- l wish you could think who he was.
- You're overtired.

351
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,436
Perhaps.

352
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,953
Here, dear. Put this out, will you?

353
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,509
{whining and barking}

354
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,710
What was that?

355
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,796
{whimpering}

356
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,479
That sounded like Red, Charles.

357
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,991
- What in the world's the matter with him?
- l put him in the cellar.

358
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,352
No wonder he's howling.
He's never been locked up in his life.

359
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,948
lf Red is to live with us,
he must be trained.

360
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,518
At night he will sleep in the cellar.
ln the daytime he'll be kept on a leash.

361
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,236
l don't believe in dogs being
treated like prisoners. Red's my dog.

362
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,035
Please, Mary. l know what's best.

363
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,833
{Red whines and barks}

364
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,237
Hi, Red. Thought you'd gone
to live with your mistress.

365
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,194
Mary brought him home.
Said he howls all night.

366
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,835
- Fishing any good in these parts?
- Pretty fair. Like to come?

367
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,318
l've got the wrong clothes on, but
the fish probably won't mind. Thank you.

368
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,959
l'm just not lucky today, that's all.

369
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,039
- Would you like a candy bar?
- l don't mind if l do.

370
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,190
- All your folks like fishing?
- My dad always brings in something.

371
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,754
- What about Charles?
- Charles?

372
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,393
Oh.

373
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,117
l have to call him Mr Rankin at school.
l get a little mixed up sometimes.

374
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,312
He spends most of his time on the clock.

375
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,510
Why don't you like him, Noah?

376
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,954
- What do you mean?
- You don't like your brother-in-law.

377
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,119
lt's none of my business,
but l wish you'd tell me why.

378
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,835
Well... l like him well enough.

379
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,633
l don't know any reason why l shouldn't.

380
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,436
Don't tell me l'm butting in - l know l am -
but l can't help myself.

381
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,074
lt's my business.

382
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,591
l hate bringing you into this,
but you're the only one l can turn to.

383
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,110
- l need your help very badly.
- What is it?

384
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,158
Your sister may be in trouble. You're man
enough for what l'm asking you to do.

385
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,909
The truth is,
l'm not really an antique dealer.

386
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,749
l'm sort of a detective.

387
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,996
Well... what do you
want me to do, Mr Wilson?

388
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,635
lt would help if l knew every move
Rankin made on his wedding day.

389
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,036
- Right up to the ceremony.
- Well, l should be able to...

390
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,314
- Unless Charles realises what l'm doing.
- l'll keep him busy.

391
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:01,074
You must be wrong. Mary wouldn't
fall in love with that kind of a man.

392
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,988
l hope l am wrong, but that's the way it is.

393
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,749
People can't help
who they fall in love with.

394
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,711
- Evening, Mr Potter.
- Evening, Mr Wilson.

395
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,479
- Evening, boys.
- Evening, sir.

396
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,116
85 cents.

397
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,828
Hear you and Rankin aim to fix the clock.

398
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,996
That's right.

399
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,796
- Figure it to tell time rightly?
- Mm-hm.

400
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,669
And will the angel
circle around the belfry?

401
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,114
- ls that a man or a woman angel?
- l don't know.

402
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,073
Well, reckon it don't make
much of a difference amongst angels.

403
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,758
Well:

404
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,790
- Give up?
- No. We'll play it out.

405
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,798
That's my privilege. 25 cents.

406
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,199
Oh, by the way, did Mr Rankin
pick up his supper this evening?

407
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,436
No.

408
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,677
He generally gets through
up there about now.

409
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,756
Yes, l know.

410
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,594
Gets dark earlier these days.

411
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,629
Our man never did pick up his suitcase.

412
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,830
- No.
- Strange.

413
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,030
Ain't it, though?

414
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,392
l've been tempted once or twice
to look and see what's inside it.

415
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,476
{whispers} lt ain't even locked.

416
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,639
- Seems to me you have a perfect right.
- You do?

417
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,115
- l'd need a witness.
- That's me.

418
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,360
lt is? That's all l wanted to know.
Let's see what's in there.

419
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,876
Wonder what's in it?

420
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,230
- Soiled linen.
- Uh-huh.

421
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,873
- Sweater.
- Uh-huh.

422
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,711
Soap and a razor wrapped in a towel
with ''SS Cristobal'' written across it.

423
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,116
- A pair of old shoes.
- Yep.

424
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,397
- Nothing but religious pamphlets.
- Yep, that's all.

425
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,988
Evening, Mr Potter. Hello, Mr Wilson.

426
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,873
- Mr Wilson, hi.
- Evening, Mr Rankin.

427
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,039
Mr Potter and l have been poking our
noses into somebody else's business.

428
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,597
That suitcase. That chap left it here
and he never did call back.

429
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,996
- lt's been over two weeks.
- Did he say what he was doing here?

430
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,680
No. Looked in the phone book,
didn't telephone.

431
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,955
Funny-looking, he was. Scrawny with
big stary blue eyes and a queer walk.

432
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,548
Like any second
he might break into a run.

433
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,036
- Did he have a foreign accent?
- Why, yes. He did.

434
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,072
Not so much of an accent
as a foreign way of talking.

435
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,034
Do you happen to know
who he could be, Mrs Rankin?

436
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,037
Why... why, no.

437
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,910
l was just trying to
complete your mystery for you.

438
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,670
Don't all foreign strangers
have to have foreign accents?

439
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,789
- Mary, have you seen Red?
- Why, no.

440
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,911
Not since l took him home to you.

441
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,998
He's been spending all his time
out in the woods.

442
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,159
- Thought you told me he never ran away.
- That's why Noah's so anxious.

443
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,157
Come on, Mary.

444
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,238
Good night, Mr Wilson. Night, Noah.

445
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,073
Were you able to find out anything?

446
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,279
Meinike did go to Rankin's house.
And your sister did see him.

447
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,994
- Did Mary say so?
- She started to.

448
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,232
Your sister's a fine woman, but she must
find out the kind of man she's married to.

449
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,558
She wouldn't listen to anything
against him. Much less believe it.

450
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,435
We must arrange it so that she finds out
for herself. Do you understand?

451
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,359
Yes.

452
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,994
lt's certain she knows nothing now.

453
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,433
Except that he didn't want her to admit
having seen someone she did see.

454
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,155
l'd give something to know
what explanation he's making now.

455
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,910
l was a student in Geneva.
There was a girl.

456
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,431
The night before l was to leave
we went out on the lake together.

457
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,714
She told me unless l promised to
marry her she'd never return to shore.

458
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:32,279
l thought she was joking, naturally,
but... she wasn't.

459
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,112
Before l could stop her
she stood up in the boat, and...

460
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:46,872
Well, l dived in after her
but it was too late, she was gone.

461
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,470
Only one person knew we were
on the lake together. Her brother.

462
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,832
He knew l hadn't murdered her,

463
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,317
but he told me he'd be willing to
call it an accident for a compensation.

464
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,079
l gave him all l had and left Switzerland.

465
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,514
As the years went by l allowed myself
to believe the dead past really was dead.

466
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,351
And then... on our wedding day, Mary,
he appeared again.

467
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,233
Her brother. The little man.

468
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,676
l gave him all the money
l had in the world.

469
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,556
And he went away again.

470
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,595
Oh, darling.

471
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,756
You should have told me,

472
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,237
and not carried this awful thing
around by yourself.

473
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:43,034
You're a very wonderful person, Mary.
l love you very much.

474
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,196
Oh, Charles.

475
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,469
But... why didn't he
go back for his things?

476
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,116
Well...

477
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,999
l suppose once he had money
he could afford better.

478
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,756
Darling, l'm terribly nervous.

479
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,034
Think l'll work up in the clock alone
tonight, by myself. lt will calm me.

480
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,391
- You understand, don't you?
- Of course l understand.

481
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,355
- Shall l walk you home?
- No, dear. There's no need for that.

482
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,076
- lt's late.
- That's all right.

483
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,636
ln Harper there's nothing to be afraid of.

484
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,996
l love you.

485
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,436
Poor old Red.
He heard my whistle, l'll bet.

486
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,072
He couldn't bark or anything.

487
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,794
He just crawled this far and died.

488
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,799
- Why do you think he died?
- Let's go and find out.

489
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,474
That's young Longstreet's dog, Red.
Looks like he's dead to me.

490
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,070
They're taking him up to
Dr Lawrence's office.

491
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,589
Do you know anything about it?

492
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,154
What in the world's happening?

493
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,077
Checkers?

494
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,030
No. No, thank you.

495
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,116
That Coke's a nickel.

496
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,316
Thank you, Mr Rankin.

497
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,629
Doctor, how long could the dog
have lived with that amount of poison?

498
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,718
Not more than a minute or so, l'd say.

499
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:07,317
Then Red was poisoned within a few
hundred yards of where you found him.

500
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,879
ln the latter part of the distance, he must
have been moving slower and slower.

501
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,794
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- Thanks, Jeff.

502
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,432
Mr Peabody, would you get that
magazine rack in and hurry up about it?

503
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,790
Yes, Mr Potter.

504
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,753
Hurry up about it. Move along.

505
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,713
Afternoon, Mr Wilson. Afternoon, Noah.

506
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,798
Bring them right in there, Mr Peabody.

507
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:56,196
What does the law say about this kind of
murder? ls it the same as killing a man?

508
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,709
lt ought to be. lt's just as bad.

509
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,913
Forepaws muddy. No mud on hind.

510
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,274
Dry leaves mixed with the mud.

511
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,475
Red must have been
digging in the woods.

512
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,637
Have you any idea what for, Mr Wilson?

513
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,676
A body, l think. Meinike's.

514
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,756
The little man.

515
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,678
Then...

516
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,196
- You just caught me.
- Anything wrong?

517
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,392
You mean closing up?
Just going on a search.

518
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,715
- What are you after?
- Oil. What search?

519
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,630
For the body. State police
deputised half the town. Fourth shelf.

520
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,389
One misses the news up in the tower.
What body?

521
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,356
My bet is, fella that left his bags here.
Scrawny little duck. Unhappy-looking.

522
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,675
l knew he'd come to a bad end.

523
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,554
That oil will be 1 5 cents.
l'll just put it on your account.

524
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,636
{door shuts}

525
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,194
Sara told me you were up here.

526
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,834
Why are you packing?
Are we going somewhere?

527
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,394
We aren't, dearest. l am.

528
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,079
What?

529
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,590
As a rule, men leave their wives
because they don't love them.

530
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,712
l must leave you because l do.

531
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,595
You won't object once you know
the kind of man you married.

532
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,756
But you are the man l've married
and that's all that matters.

533
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,158
Darling, l meant it
when l said for better or for worse.

534
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,510
Even to...

535
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,596
to killing Red?

536
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,789
You couldn't have.

537
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,909
- lt was an accident.
- No, l meant to kill him.

538
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,909
Murder can be a chain, one link leading
to another until it circles your neck.

539
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,919
Red was digging at the grave
of the man l killed.

540
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,476
Yes, your little man.

541
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,919
- You killed him?
- With these hands.

542
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,157
The same hands that have held you close.
Now are you satisfied to let me go?

543
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,589
Why? Why did you do it?

544
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,030
l'd have given him all l had,
but his dreams were far grander.

545
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,276
He knew your father was well-to-do.

546
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:51,112
He knew he would be glad to protect you
from scandal for a few thousand dollars.

547
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:58,479
l should have gone away and lost myself
in a world where he could never find me.

548
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,557
But l loved you. And l was weak.

549
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,196
Darling...

550
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,917
lf one of us goes, we'll both go.

551
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,192
You would have shared
half my trouble if l'd had any.

552
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,677
Charles, what is there
to connect you with that man?

553
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,435
Nothing, actually. You're the only one
that knows l knew him.

554
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,836
Then you need have no fear.
lf l'm the only one who can speak.

555
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:37,638
But, Mary, in failing to speak,
you become part of the crime.

556
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,472
But l'm already a part of it,
because l'm a part of you.

557
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,988
But you shudder at the touch of my hands
as though it was the touch of death.

558
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,076
lt's nerves.

559
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,151
Hold me close, Charles. Hold me close.

560
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,713
Mr Peabody, open up the coroner's office.

561
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,070
l knew darn well it was the same fella.

562
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,352
Course he's changed some.
Being buried in the earth does it.

563
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,677
Evening, Mr Wilson. Evening, Noah.

564
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,429
- Evening, Mr Potter.
- A mess, ain't it?

565
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,269
What do we do about Mary? We can't
leave her with him now we know.

566
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:27,555
She realises now that whatever story
he told her about Meinike was false.

567
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,035
Noah, l think your sister
should be ready to hear the truth.

568
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,198
Charles.

569
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,073
Will they make me look at the body?

570
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,230
l shouldn't think so.

571
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,995
Because l couldn't do it.
l mean, l don't think l could.

572
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,429
See, l've never seen a dead person.

573
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,118
l...

574
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,270
- How many are you having to tea, Mary?
- 28 altogether.

575
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,517
- You didn't eat nothing at dinner.
- lsn't that a lot?

576
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,949
- 28 for just you and Sara?
- No.

577
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,435
We'll manage all right.

578
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,556
- But suppose l...
- What?

579
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,231
l don't know. l'm terrified of
seeing anybody or being seen.

580
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,715
You must get tight hold of yourself.

581
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,594
To go through with this, you must know
what you're going to do and say.

582
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,917
Perfect naturalness at all times.

583
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,554
Now, darling, listen to me.

584
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,636
- Darling...
- {phone}

585
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,513
l am prepared to go to the police.

586
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,315
- lt's your father, Miss Mary.
- Thank you, Sara.

587
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,078
Mary...

588
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,635
Hello?

589
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,196
Yes, l think so. Just a minute and l'll see.

590
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,550
- He wants me to come over.
- Did he ask me too?

591
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,238
He said he wanted to see me alone.

592
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,353
There's nothing unusual about
a father wanting to see his daughter.

593
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,835
- ls there?
- No.

594
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,678
All right. l'll be right over.

595
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,753
- Don't you think that's rather strange?
- Strange? No.

596
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,839
l'll go and work on the clock
while you're with your father.

597
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,952
You can come by and pick me up later.

598
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,594
l'm so afraid.

599
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,713
He was so pointed about wanting to
see me alone. He sounded different.

600
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,877
You know what you're
going to say, don't you?

601
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,396
Come in, Mary.

602
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,595
ls something wrong?

603
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:17,317
Mr Wilson is here on a serious matter.
We must help him every way possible.

604
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,597
He wants to ask a few questions of you.

605
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,113
What do you want to know, Mr Wilson?

606
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,193
You know about the body
that was discovered yesterday?

607
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,878
Yes.

608
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,834
- Did you ever meet the deceased?
- No, l never met him.

609
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,073
Have you seen the body?

610
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,758
No.

611
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,077
Then how can you be sure
you've never met him?

612
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,355
Of course l can't be certain.

613
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,274
Do you suspect me of something?
lf so, what?

614
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,436
Of shielding a murderer.

615
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,038
Perhaps this will refresh your memory.

616
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,115
Do you recognise this man?

617
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,270
Konrad Meinike. Commander of one of
the more efficient concentration camps.

618
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,279
You know him, don't you?
You have met him here in Harper.

619
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,078
No, l've never seen that man, Mr Wilson.

620
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,957
Judge, would you mind
putting out the lights?

621
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,675
l've been showing him some films.
l'd like you to see them too.

622
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,432
l'm on the Allied Commission
for the Punishment of War Criminals.

623
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:38,112
lt's my job to bring Nazis to justice.
lt's that job that brought me to Harper.

624
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,679
Surely you don't think that...
l've never...

625
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,112
- l've never even seen a Nazi.
- You might without realising it.

626
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,588
They look like other people and act like
other people, when it's to their benefit.

627
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,510
A gas chamber.

628
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,716
The candidates were given hot showers

629
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:10,392
so that their pores would be open
and the gas would act more quickly.

630
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:17,077
And this is a lime pit, in which men,
women and children were buried alive.

631
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,269
Why do you want me
to look at these horrors?

632
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,550
All this you're seeing...

633
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,639
lt's all the product of one mind.

634
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,316
The mind of a man named...

635
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:36,675
- Franz Kindler.
- Franz Kindler?

636
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,156
Yes. He was the most brilliant
of the younger Nazis.

637
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:46,198
He conceived the theory of genocide,
mass depopulation of conquered lands.

638
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,992
So no matter who won the war,

639
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,033
Germany would be the strongest nation
in Europe, biologically speaking.

640
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,632
Unlike Goebbels, Himmler and the rest,
Kindler had a passion for anonymity.

641
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,593
The newspapers carried
no picture of him.

642
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,712
Before he disappeared
he destroyed every evidence

643
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,638
that might link him with his past.

644
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:12,153
There's no clue to the identity of Kindler -
except one little thing.

645
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,512
He has a hobby that almost
amounts to a mania. Clocks.

646
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,231
So have lots of people. You yourself.

647
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,477
l'm not quite finished, Mrs Rankin.

648
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,271
ln prison in Czechoslovakia
a war criminal was awaiting execution.

649
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,076
This was Konrad Meinike, one-time
executive officer for Franz Kindler.

650
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,794
He was an obscenity
on the face of the earth.

651
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,957
The stench of burning flesh
was in his clothes.

652
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,835
But we gave him his freedom on the
chance that he might lead me to Kindler.

653
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,795
He led me here.
And here l lost him.

654
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,435
Until yesterday.
Your dog Red found him for me.

655
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,075
But unfortunately Meinike
was dead and buried.

656
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:06,675
Now, in all the world, there's only one
person who can identify Franz Kindler.

657
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:14,432
The one who knows - knows definitely -
who Meinike came to Harper to see.

658
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,395
No, he's not a Nazi.
My Charles is not a Nazi:

659
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,595
You were at Rankin's house
on the day you were married.

660
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,278
- Yes.
- Did anyone come?

661
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,279
- Not that l remember.
- Try hard. lt's not so long ago.

662
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,312
- No one came.
- Were you alone all the time?

663
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,670
- No.
- Who else was there?

664
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:47,796
Charles. He came after his last class and
we were together for more than an hour.

665
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,472
You have nothing to link him with Kindler
except a wild suspicion. lt's ridiculous.

666
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,319
You want to use me
to implicate him and you can't.

667
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,399
You can't involve me in a lie
and that's all it is, is a lie.

668
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,512
lt's a lie, you know. lt's a lie.

669
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,676
Mary:

670
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,756
Wait a minute. Mary:

671
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,271
Mary:

672
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,356
Wait a minute, sister.

673
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,676
That's better.

674
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:52,553
You know that your welfare and Noah's
means more to me than anything.

675
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,069
Yes, yes.

676
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,478
We've got to face this thing
with complete honesty, sister.

677
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:05,914
Your entire happiness may well depend
on your telling me the absolute truth.

678
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:12,195
lf Mr Wilson is right and you have married
a criminal, then there is no marriage.

679
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,630
There's no call upon
your loyalty as a wife.

680
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,149
He's good.

681
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:24,628
He's good. He wouldn't hurt anybody
except to protect somebody he loved.

682
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,309
- He's good.
- Then the truth can't hurt him.

683
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,559
Charles was not with you
that afternoon, sister.

684
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,435
- l remember your saying so.
- You're against him too, Adam.

685
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:44,429
You've never liked him. That's why you
don't believe me now. Leave us alone.

686
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,757
He's not a Nazi.
He's not one of those people.

687
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,393
Leave us alone.

688
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,357
She has the facts now.
But she won't accept them.

689
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,633
They're too horrible
for her to acknowledge.

690
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,228
Not so much that Rankin
could be Kindler,

691
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:12,309
but that she could ever have
given her love to such a creature.

692
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,432
But we have one ally. Her subconscious.

693
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,869
lt knows what the truth is
and is struggling to be heard.

694
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,279
The will to truth within your daughter
is much too strong to be denied.

695
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,269
Look here. lf he's not Charles Rankin
we should be able to expose him.

696
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,678
l'm not interested in proving that
he isn't Rankin, only that he is Kindler.

697
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,155
How do you propose to do that?

698
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,116
Through your daughter.

699
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,474
She's headed for a breakdown. That's
the usual result of being inwardly divided.

700
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,319
Rankin will see this.
That's what l'm banking on.

701
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,433
He can't trust a person near hysteria.
He'll have to act.

702
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:00,997
He may try to run before she collapses,
which would be an admission of guilt.

703
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,190
- Or...
- Go on.

704
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,036
He may kill her.

705
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:11,638
You're shocked at my cold-bloodedness.
That's natural. You're her father.

706
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,959
lt's because you are her father
that l'm talking to you like this.

707
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:21,232
Naturally we'll try to prevent
murder being done.

708
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,838
But the proof that murder is his aim would
be the strongest evidence she could have.

709
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,428
{clock strikes}

710
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,156
Charles.

711
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,873
Listen. lt's striking. After 100 years.

712
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,037
lt was a trap, just like you said.
Mr Wilson was there.

713
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,199
He tried to tell me you were a Nazi.
And l was supposed to believe it.

714
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,029
lmagine you being an escaped Nazi:
He thinks he's clever, Wilson.

715
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,596
He wanted me to tell him
about the little man.

716
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:13,271
- Who did he say he thought l was?
- A Nazi. Franz Kindler.

717
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,556
He made it all up to trick me.
But l didn't tell them anything.

718
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,194
l outfaced both of them, Charles.

719
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,551
lt'll be simple enough to prove
you're not that Nazi.

720
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,639
We'll just find someone
who was in your class at college.

721
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,399
lf what you say is true
he can't touch me.

722
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,637
l'm quite safe if you say nothing.

723
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:41,508
l won't. l promise l won't. They can
torture me and l won't tell them anything.

724
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,031
Look. The chimes have awakened Harper.

725
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,434
We must go down and greet them.

726
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:59,030
- You must act naturally. Smile at them.
- Yes.

727
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,391
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l'm all right.

728
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,670
We'll face them, darling.

729
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,151
And when she struck, that angel started
marching. lt was a sight to behold.

730
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,795
- You knocked it off. My hat's off to you.
- Congratulations.

731
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,956
Won't the rector be delighted:

732
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,392
lf she's going to chime all night long,
how's a body going to get any sleep?

733
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,592
We'll face them, darling. All of them.

734
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,919
Them chickens of yours is going to be
on and off the roost every 1 5 minutes.

735
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,109
Sara, l've told you
l want these curtains drawn.

736
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,392
- The sunlight is bad for them.
- That's rubbish and you know it.

737
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:55,355
- At the other house we didn't close them.
- This is my house and l want them drawn.

738
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,996
Suit yourself, then. lt's going to look
mighty gloomy for the party.

739
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,271
- ls it that time already?
- {doorbell}

740
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,711
Were you able to see
when they opened the grave?

741
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,675
- Not the most pleasant sight.
- There's Mary. Hello, Mary.

742
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,473
Filling out prescriptions is something
l hate. Sleeping pills is another.

743
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,398
- They're for Mrs Rankin.
- Want them wrapped?

744
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,511
- No.
- Don't approve of them.

745
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,915
Man works, man gets a night's sleep.

746
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,759
Or he could till that clock
started bonging.

747
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,952
l believe Mrs Rankin
ordered some ice cream.

748
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,915
Already gone. Fella said he was going
past your house so l gave it to him.

749
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,190
Mr Wilson.

750
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:52,517
- Mrs Rankin.
- {woman} Wouldn't leave the house alone.

751
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,668
He might be anywhere, the murderer.
Waiting for a new victim.

752
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,315
l hope you haven't forgotten
you were kind enough to invite me.

753
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,955
- No, of course not.
- Mr Potter asked me to deliver this.

754
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:10,756
- Good. Sara's waiting for it.
- l hope it hasn't melted.

755
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,475
- l won't detain you any longer.
- l have a drink for you.

756
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:18,559
- Just the medicine l need.
- You know Dr Hippard?

757
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,830
- Can l get you something else?
- Nothing more, thank you, dear.

758
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,599
- Where's Doctor Rankin?
- He'll be here soon.

759
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,871
- l want a word with him about that clock.
- Yes.

760
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,916
May l get you some more tea?

761
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,795
..Jack the Ripper.
And what was that Frenchman's name?

762
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:47,391
There may well be ten or a dozen graves
out there in those woods.

763
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,590
He was murdered just three weeks ago.

764
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:53,269
- May l get you some more tea?
- Thank you, no.

765
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,552
l forget what Emerson says about crime.
There's Rankin. He may know.

766
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,275
- Sorry to be late.
- Darling.

767
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,871
Hello there, Rankin.
You know the quotation. Emerson.

768
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,878
''Commit a crime,
and the earth is made of glass.''

769
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,956
No, l don't.

770
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,916
''Commit a crime,
and the earth is made of glass.''

771
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,996
Commit a crime...

772
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,032
''Commit a crime, and it seems as if
a coat of snow fell on the ground,

773
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:30,679
such as reveals in the woods the track of
every partridge and squirrel and mole.''

774
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,555
''You cannot recall the spoken word,
you cannot wipe out the foot-track,

775
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,832
you cannot draw up the ladder
so as to leave no inlet or clue.''

776
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,315
You're Mr Wilson, aren't you? You're
our No.1 suspect in our murder case.

777
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,352
So far you're the only suspect.
Potter fingered you.

778
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:52,268
He thinks you committed the crime
to get possession of some antique.

779
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:57,758
{woman} l wish you'd let that clock alone.
Harper was a nice quiet place.

780
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,148
- Mary, what's Wilson doing here?
- l don't know.

781
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:07,319
- You invited him. What's he after?
- l don't know.

782
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,916
- Are you all right?
- Yes, quite all right.

783
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,156
- Remember Friday, Mary.
- Yes, all right.

784
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,590
- May l help you, dear?
- No.

785
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,796
No: No, no:

786
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,030
- Mary, Mary...
- {sobs}

787
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,117
lt's all right, dear. lt's all right.

788
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,309
lt broke, and the beads
fell all over the floor.

789
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,470
He took her upstairs.

790
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:00,595
- When l left l could still hear her crying.
- The floodgates have opened.

791
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,473
Her subconscious has almost won.

792
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,235
From now on we must know
every move that Mrs Rankin makes.

793
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,796
She's never to leave the house
unless l know where she's going.

794
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:17,233
lf l can't be found she's to be detained,
no matter on what pretext.

795
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,316
Don't worry. She won't get by me.

796
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,398
When she snapped those beads
it was her death warrant.

797
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,353
We're carrying her life in our hands.

798
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:32,230
Every time she walks on a slippery
sidewalk, is near something that can fall,

799
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,751
drives an automobile - anything that
could result in an accidental death -

800
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,440
her life is in danger.

801
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,516
She won't get by me.

802
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,996
{sawing}

803
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,116
{clock strikes}

804
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,076
{bell rings}

805
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,510
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sir.

806
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:56,031
Today we will finish with
the career of Friedrich der Groâe,

807
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:01,393
Konig von Preuâen, Kurfurst
von Brandenburg, Prinz von Polen.

808
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,750
Frederick the Great to you.

809
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,796
- 862, please.
- {Potter} That'll be 85 cents.

810
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,076
{whistles softly}

811
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,119
- Hello?
- {softly} Hello, Mary.

812
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,996
Mary, this is Charles.

813
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,836
Can you hear me, dear?

814
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,191
l can't speak loudly,
but l want you to understand this.

815
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:40,030
Something very important has come up.
Come to the church immediately.

816
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,153
- The church tower. Understand?
- Yes, l understand.

817
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,953
l don't want anybody to know
you're going there.

818
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:53,918
Don't tell anybody. Leave your car in the
rear and come in through the back door.

819
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,474
OK? All right, then.

820
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,915
- Peabody:
- Coming.

821
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,719
Stack that wood down there,
then get back to work.

822
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,796
Yes, sir.

823
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,116
{logs clatter}

824
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,076
Watch that, Mr Peabody.

825
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,878
Your move, Professor.

826
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,436
Going someplace?

827
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,590
Where to?

828
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,154
- l asked you where you was going.
- l heard.

829
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,998
Well?

830
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,271
You forget l am no longer a child.
l'm a married woman.

831
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,631
Well, you ain't been married very long.

832
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,236
Wait, Mrs Rankin.

833
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:53,755
- What is it? l'm in a hurry.
- No need to go biting my head off:

834
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,000
- What is it, Sara?
- Well, l...

835
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:06,712
- lf you've got something to say, say it.
- l don't know what's got into you.

836
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,513
You never was mean to me
back at the old house.

837
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:13,599
Maybe l've outworn my usefulness.
l'm not as young as l used to be.

838
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,757
- Maybe you don't want me around.
- Don't talk nonsense.

839
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:22,034
lt's true and you know it.
l'm going to pack my things and leave.

840
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,314
l'm sorry if l've hurt your feelings.
l didn't mean to, really l didn't.

841
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,873
Sara...

842
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,231
l couldn't get along without you.
You know that, don't you?

843
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,237
- Well, don't you?
- Honest?

844
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,352
- Honestly. Cross my...
- Oh, Miss Mary.

845
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,073
Please, wait just a minute.

846
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,033
Sara, you'll never leave me, will you?

847
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,355
- You know how l feel about you.
- Yes.

848
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:52,438
Like you was my own daughter.
My own little girl.

849
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,711
l've got to go now. Really.
l've promised to be somewhere.

850
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,990
Well, where to, Miss Mary?

851
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,432
Stop fussing, Sara.

852
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,476
lt's a secret.

853
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,551
{screams} Miss Mary:

854
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,510
What's the matter?

855
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,474
My heart. l can't breathe. The pain:

856
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,149
No, Miss Mary. Please don't leave me.

857
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,350
Lie right there and keep quiet.

858
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,517
- Maybe l'm dying.
- You're not dying.

859
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,795
- Stay with me.
- l won't leave you.

860
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,319
1 30, please.

861
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,069
Yes, Mary?

862
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:43,637
l was supposed to meet Charles
at the clock tower and l can't get there.

863
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,832
Will you go and tell him
to please wait for me?

864
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,795
Noah, no one's to know where
or why you're going. lt's important.

865
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,556
All right.

866
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,916
238, please.

867
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,319
May l speak to Mr Wilson?

868
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,396
{whistles}

869
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:12,114
- Looks like it's coming up for snow.
- Yes, that's right.

870
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,196
{whistles}

871
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:44,916
lsn't it after hours? You ladies
are working too hard at the library.

872
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,589
Oh, no, Mr Rankin,
we closed as usual at 3.30.

873
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:54,158
You're perfectly right.
l dismissed class ten minutes early.

874
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,589
lt's 3.44.

875
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,430
l was playing checkers with Mr Potter
and l didn't realise.

876
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:06,509
You know what you are?
You're the absent-minded professor.

877
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,556
{clock chimes}

878
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:45,158
- You sure are lucky today.
- l am.

879
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,919
- Mr Potter.
- Afternoon, Mr Hill.

880
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:51,430
- l can't find the earmuffs.
- Right over there by the mittens.

881
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,473
- Come on, help us look.
- l'll be right back.

882
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,718
Right over there by that box.
Latest thing out.

883
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,392
- How much?
- 85 cents.

884
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,479
- That's an awful lot.
- They come high this year.

885
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,552
- You want this thing?
- l'll keep it.

886
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:15,434
You're a bad influence. l intended
only to spend a couple of minutes.

887
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,752
- Look what time it is.
- Yeah. l'd like to get even.

888
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,268
lt's your move.

889
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:31,033
He really had the wind up. You can
still smell the glue where he joined it.

890
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,957
Look at that.
Like l told you, it's coming up for snow.

891
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,316
Look here, Professor.

892
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,230
Double or nothing?

893
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,316
{clock strikes}

894
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:20,074
- Afternoon, Mr Potter.
- Afternoon, Professor.

895
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,396
{Mary} Charles?

896
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,870
- You didn't go the church.
- No. Sara...

897
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,197
- What about Sara?
- Sara had some kind of an attack.

898
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:06,271
She's resting now. Jeff said it wasn't very
serious, but that l should stay with her.

899
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:20,918
- What's the matter, Charles?
- Nothing's the matter.

900
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,795
Then why did you want me to go to
the church? You said it was important.

901
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,150
lt wasn't. Nothing, actually.

902
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:32,637
lt's my sense of proportion
has failed me these days.

903
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,955
Please, Charles. What is it?

904
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,396
l'm sorry.

905
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:49,357
l've just begun to feel the strain.
You see, l have my weak moments too.

906
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,719
l'll tell you in my own good time.

907
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,513
- Have they found out anything more?
- Nothing to find out. Unless you...

908
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:01,838
- l haven't seen anybody all day.
- l heard there's an arrest to be made.

909
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:06,715
My head aches. The incident with
the beads made me doubt your strength.

910
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:13,279
l thought maybe you'd gone to your father
and told him something. lf you had...

911
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,629
- You didn't have to be afraid.
- No?

912
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,274
- What did you tell Noah?
- What about?

913
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,233
- Didn't you see him?
- Why should l see Noah?

914
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,033
- Did you come from the church?
- Are we in court?

915
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,994
No, but l told Noah to go there
and tell you l was detained.

916
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,396
l told you not to call anybody.
Call him and tell him not to go.

917
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,317
- l can't.
- Call him, l say:

918
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,557
- He's gone:
- lf he dies, his blood is on your hands.

919
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,240
- What?
- lt's your meddling that's done this.

920
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,955
lt would have been all right
if it wasn't for you.

921
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,992
But you had to be here. On that day.

922
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,874
- Hanging your stupid curtains:
- Did you kill Noah?

923
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,437
Yes, if he goes to the church
and climbs up that ladder:

924
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:06,038
- lt was l you intended to kill, wasn't it?
- No.

925
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,116
Why wasn't it l?

926
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,756
Franz Kindler:

927
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,756
Kill me. Kill me, l want you to.

928
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:20,112
l couldn't face life knowing what l've been
to you and what l've done to Noah.

929
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,949
But when you kill me
don't put your hands on me.

930
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,152
Here. Use this.

931
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,756
{Noah} Mary.

932
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,038
Noah:

933
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,709
{Wilson} Operator.
Get me the state police.

934
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,796
{clock strikes}

935
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:56,110
Yes, the roadblocks are up.

936
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:03,037
We're watching the railroad station
and he isn't hiding in the woods.

937
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,794
Judge Longstreet:

938
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,637
Get Wilson, Noah. l'll go for the police.

939
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,994
lf he is where l think he is,
it'll be easy.

940
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:20,511
- We'll do all we can to take him alive.
- She's gone.

941
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,791
- She's not in the house.
- Clock tower?

942
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,278
l don't know.

943
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,110
lf that's where he's hiding
and she gets there before us...

944
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:35,870
- What'll we do?
- Call Captain Samuels and the deputies.

945
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,152
{groans} Ouch:

946
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,475
- The church:
- What about you?

947
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,910
l'll get there. Hurry up.
Your sister may be still alive.

948
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,232
{Rankin} Don't move. l have a gun.

949
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,352
You don't need it. l'm alone.

950
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:27,157
- What are you doing here?
- Lift me up.

951
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,309
- You're telling the truth?
- Why should l lie?

952
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,038
- You were followed here?
- l came by our way.

953
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:47,197
Through the cemetery. No one saw me.

954
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,876
{clock chimes}

955
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,551
l needed the excuse.
l was afraid you wouldn't let me up.

956
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,517
- What do you want?
- l came to kill you.

957
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,799
{laughs}

958
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,230
No, Mary, it's you that's going to die.

959
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,909
You were meant to fall
through that ladder.

960
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,796
You're going to fall.

961
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,235
l don't mind, if l take you with me.

962
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,636
You are a fool.

963
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,548
They searched the woods.
l watched them.

964
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,194
Like God looking at little ants.

965
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,834
l'll hide in the woods.
They won't look again.

966
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,679
When they find me
they'll know you're still here.

967
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,110
You were on the verge of a breakdown.
Now you've cracked.

968
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:54,995
Why else would you leave your bed,
climb here in the dead of night?

969
01:27:55,120 --> 01:28:00,672
- Any child could see you'd kill yourself.
- Killing is what led you here.

970
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,516
lt won't help you now.

971
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,108
Look out the window. Look:

972
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,799
That's an old trick. A very poor trick.

973
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,515
Tricks: That's all you know, is tricks.

974
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:20,316
l don't need any tricks. No matter what
happens to me tricks will do you no good.

975
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:23,678
You're finished, Herr Franz Kindler.

976
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,750
The citizens of Harper.
They've come after you.

977
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,395
The plain, ordinary people,
the ones you've been laughing at.

978
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,511
Well, you can't fool them any more.

979
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:48,269
Sure, you can kill me, Mary,
half the people down there.

980
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,436
But there's no escape.

981
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,597
The world closed in on you
till there was only Harper.

982
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,075
That closed in
and there was only this room.

983
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,794
And this room too is closing in on you.

984
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,914
lt's not true, the things they say l did.
l followed orders.

985
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:08,192
- You gave the orders.
- l only did my duty.

986
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:14,150
Don't send me back there.
l'm not a criminal.

987
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,350
You are.

988
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,796
Give me that gun:

989
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,151
{gun clicks}

990
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,553
{screaming}

991
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,320
All right, Mary's safe.
Let me give you a hand.

992
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,159

993
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:45,637
- V-day in Harper.
- l don't get that. Come on down.

994
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,274
No, not until you get me a new ladder.

995
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,392
l've had my ankle busted
and my head conked.

996
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:56,435
- From here on in l'm taking it easy.
- l'll get you another ladder.

997
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,630
You've had enough trouble.

998
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,672
Good night, Mary. Pleasant dreams.
