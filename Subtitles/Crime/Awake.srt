Hey.

23
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,563
What were you doing under there?

24
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,338
Just thinking.

25
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,069
What about?

26
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,271
Wait, let me guess.

27
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:32,182
You were thinking about
making love to me all morning

28
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,016
and then taking me out
for a really big breakfast.

29
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,613
- Close.
- Yeah?

30
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,592
Actually, I was...

picturing you soaking wet
with all of your clothes on.

00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,932
- No. Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

- Mm-hmm.

- Oh.

00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,670
All right, hang on.

- Ah!
- Shit.

- [laughs]
- You're such an asshole.

41
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,873
- Come here.
- I didn't scare you, did I?

42
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,576
You did.

43
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,744
There we go.

00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,511
You'll live.

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,857
Thank you.

00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,005
Have you seen my pager?

00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,131
- Yep.
- Ah.

00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,142
- Wait. Hang on.

I don't care, Tommy.

They open at 6,
we open at 5, all right?

53
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:09,781
There are jobs at stake, man.

54
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,681
Just get it done.

55
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,721
Then we'll talk to them at
the Halloween thing tonight.

56
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,085
Yeah, all right. I'll be in soon.

You know I can't.

00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,588
You know, share a paper,

61
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,826
Baby, I'm late as it is.

62
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,665
I don't even know
what section you like, Clay.

63
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:52,017
I deserve my happily
ever after, too.

64
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,721
I know you do.

65
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,493
And I'm going to tell her, soon.

66
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,227
I promise.

67
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,327
Have a good day.

68
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,135
You, too.

69
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,778
Good morning, Mom.

70
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,588
Don't forget we're
meeting the board at 2.

71
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,717
I can't do 2.

72
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,988
I'm meeting with Dr. Harper
this afternoon.

73
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:02,994
[Woman]
Just be there.

74
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,553
These Japanese companies
are ruthless.

75
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,030
We have to close this merger.

76
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,863
[Jack]
Is this about your old man?

77
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,630
Is it about him?

78
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,433
[Clay]
Jesus, I'm not going through this again, Jack.

79
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,666
Honestly, he would
want you to tell her.

80
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,969
No, my father would want me

81
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,669
to stop fishing
in the middle of the day

82
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,211
and go back to work, all right?

83
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,577
If he knew what I was doing
with Sam, he'd disown me,

84
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,706
lying to my mom like this.

85
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,307
He'd throw me in the fucking river.

86
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,821
I want you to
take a good look around you, Clay.

87
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,255
You own half of this city.

88
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:35,226
You're creating jobs,
you're saving companies.

89
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,059
I think you've more than
filled his shoes, you know?

90
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,100
My dad's feet were four sizes bigger
than mine, Jack.

91
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,601
I can't even fill his socks.

92
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,228
Look, I got the rings, didn't I?

93
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,329
I got the license.

94
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,499
No, no, no, no.
It's not that difficult.

95
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,634
You set a date and you just do it.

96
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,075
It's not that easy, either.

97
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,170
- I mean, marriage...
- Look, she's your mother.

98
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,910
You tell her and, I swear to you,
she'll be happy.

99
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,542
You don't know my mother.

100
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,847
Listen, thanks for the fishing lesson.

101
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,149
- I'm leaving, all right?
- All right, man.

102
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,383
Look, just...
just come on with me.

103
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,254
[both laugh]

104
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,727
You know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits

105
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,263
there are in this country?

106
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,561
I mean, a hard-working
doctor is trying...

107
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,066
Are we going to go
through this again, Jack?

108
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,898
- Well, look, I've got...
- Four. Yes, I know.

109
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,494
All for trying to save people's lives.

110
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,936
It's a disgrace.

111
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,234
Well, you know why they sue us?

112
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,707
I have a very busy day.

113
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,175
Please.

114
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:28,146
It's because they don't know
what to do with their grief.

115
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:32,651
It's because people
need someone to blame.

116
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,916
It's because of patients like you

117
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:40,323
who cannot accept the facts.

118
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,985
Come on in.

119
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,860
Get acquainted. Lie down.

120
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,062
Only because you're my friend.

121
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,296
[chuckles]
I'm your doctor.

122
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,607
Get comfortable.

123
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,376
How's it feel?

124
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,046
Not so bad.

125
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:13,559
These, Clay, are the facts.

126
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,426
When I open up your chest
and remove your heart,

127
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:22,958
it is a very real possibility that you will die
right here on this table.

128
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,903
And if the transplant is successful,

129
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,932
there is a 50% chance
that you'll be dead in 10 years.

130
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,174
The clock's ticking.

131
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,841
So it's tough love today, huh?

132
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,975
You think this is a joke?

133
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,746
Look at that.

134
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,290
Hold it.

135
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,758
That's surgical steel.

136
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,421
A hundredth of an inch thick.

137
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:55,560
That thing will slice through you
as if you weren't even there.

138
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,033
Picture it, Clay.

139
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,040
Picture the incision.

140
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,840
Imagine what it will be like.

141
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,780
I need you to be ready.

142
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,278
I need you to be prepared.

143
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,688
You get your house
in order, just in case.

144
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:24,923
Tell your mother, marry the girl,
and live your life.

145
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:25,987
[defibrillator charging]

146
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,934
You might not have much of it left.

147
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,800
Okay?

148
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,668
Jack...

149
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,071
saddle up.

150
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,405
Wait, I thought we didn't
have anything until later.

151
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,342
No, Riordan's cabbage
from this morning,

152
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,344
he's in the ICU bleeding.

153
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,812
He took off for
the fucking vineyard,

154
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,746
so, uh... Hey, Clay.

155
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,341
How about letting us
have all your money

156
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,578
so that we could retire?

157
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,587
You wouldn't mind
doing that, would you?

158
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:49,587
No. You know me.

159
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,647
Go ahead, take it all.

160
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,191
What a guy.

161
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,126
Remember what I said, Clay.

162
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,720
No regrets.

163
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,729
[Man]
Jack!

164
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,595
[Jack]
The clock's ticking.

165
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,599
[Man]
Jack, what are you doing?

166
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,659
Let's go.
Let's go, Jack.

167
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,204
Come on!

<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>Promise me you'll kiss me all over.</i>

169
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,432
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

170
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,444
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

171
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,207
<i>What's wrong with right now?</i>

172
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,679
Well, I can't. I'm...

00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,013
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

174
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,485
You look beautiful, Sam.

175
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,181
I do?

176
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,087
Yeah, you do.

177
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,456
I should tell you that more often.

178
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,825
What's wrong?

179
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,389
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,526
I didn't know she was going
to be here, all right?

181
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,127
If I turn around, she'll see.

182
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,570
This is getting boring, Clay.

183
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,800
Uh-huh.

184
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,605
We're going to have to
discuss this merger later.

185
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,167
[Sam]
I feel sick.

186
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:50,148
You're not supposed
to make me feel sick.

187
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,945
Thought you'd run off and left me.

188
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,078
You remember Dr. Neyer,
don't you?

189
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,087
Hello, Clayton.

190
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,145
Good to see you again.

191
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,451
We've already been through this.

192
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,425
Dr. Harper's my surgeon.
I've already told you...

193
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,394
I know, but Jonathan
leads the field, remember?

194
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,522
Yeah, well, like I said before,

195
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,566
I have a surgeon.

196
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:11,229
Now, I know he's been
on the donor list for a year, Lilith,

197
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,738
but that's completely
normal for his type.

198
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:18,436
O-negatives like you and your son
always wait a little longer.

199
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,002
It just means
you're special, that's all.

200
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,513
Excuse me.

201
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,345
I don't think you're listening
to what I'm saying...

202
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,714
Although, since he has
a cardiomyopathy

203
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,047
of undetermined etiology...

204
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,020
Hey.

205
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,112
I'm sitting right here.

206
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,590
You want to talk
about me, talk to me.

207
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,127
- Clay.
- It's fine, Lilith.

208
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,460
You and Dr. Harper
have obviously become friends.

209
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,556
He was on call when you had
your first attack.

210
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,430
He saved your life.

211
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,595
I get the attachment. Really, I do.

212
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,936
But your mother and I
have been friends for 15 years.

213
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,498
My hands have been
inside presidents.

214
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,944
Don't you think I might at least
deserve the time of day?

215
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,176
You want to be operated on
by the best surgeon possible.

216
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,083
Don't you, Clay?

217
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,415
Good.

218
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,521
Now let's talk about the party tonight.

219
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,187
<i>No, no, no, no,</i>
<i>no, no, no, no.</i>

220
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,819
<i>Now see, that is where</i>
<i>you're wrong.</i>

221
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,989
<i>I just don't see</i>
<i>the growth in leadership.</i>

222
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,999
<i>That's why this whole</i>
<i>Beresford Capital business</i>

223
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,193
<i>scares me so much.</i>

224
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,065
<i>Now look, are my numbers</i>
<i>wrong here?</i>

225
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,798
<i>Because if the Shimotomo merger</i>
<i>does not go through soon,</i>

226
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,965
<i>then that entire firm is in a lot of trouble.</i>

227
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,702
<i>[Man 2]</i>
<i>That doesn't matter.</i>

228
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,438
<i>Look, I'm telling you,</i>
<i>Beresford better stay away from Shimotomo.</i>

229
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,740
<i>They're going to smile at your face,</i>

230
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,338
<i>and then they're going</i>
<i>to stab you in the back.</i>

231
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,439
<i>These guys are dangerous.</i>

232
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,983
<i>Trust me, I've seen them do it.</i>

233
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,110
<i>Anybody who gets</i>
<i>into business with them</i>

234
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,654
<i>is really asking for trouble.</i>

235
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,916
<i>Clay Beresford better know</i>
<i>what he's doing...</i>

236
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,924
[Woman]
Sir, they need you out there.

237
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,482
Thank you.

238
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,357
Welcome.

239
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,693
My daughter Tanya and my wife.

240
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,199
Happy Halloween.

241
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,276
Oh, here he is.

242
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,679
Whiz kid of Wall Street,

243
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,547
<i>Barron's</i> Man of the Year at 22:

244
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,449
Clayton Beresford, Jr.

245
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,856
Sir, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Inamoto and Mr. Waturi.

246
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,450
They're with our friends
at Shimotomo.

247
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,722
They're here to check up on you.

248
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,922
They know about your condition.

249
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,989
[speaking Japanese]

250
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,100
Mr. Waturi would like for you to know

251
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,900
how much respect he had
for your father,

252
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,099
Mr. Beresford.

253
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,165
He was quite a businessman.

254
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,006
Yes, he was. <i>Arigato.</i>

255
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,841
[speaking Japanese]

256
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,177
Mr. Waturi would also like to know
how you're feeling today.

257
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,011
Well, you'll have to tell Mr. Waturi
that I feel fabulous.

258
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,350
[speaking Japanese]

259
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,616
Please also tell him that I'm ready

260
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,214
to cut to the chase
whenever he is.

261
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,223
[speaking Japanese]

262
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,554
In the last eight quarters alone,

263
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,255
we bought and nurtured
over 600 companies.

264
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,061
We donate 80 million
charitable dollars per annum.

265
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,159
We provide over 16,000 jobs.

266
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,400
Mr. Waturi, my heart may be weak,
but my mind is strong.

267
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,964
And the only thing
you need to worry about

268
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,976
is which one of our 17 Niigata sakes

269
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,807
you'd like to enjoy with your dinner.

270
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,814
[speaking Japanese]

271
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,875
[speaking Japanese]

272
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,354
[chuckling]

273
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,895
You're a ridiculous person,
you know that?

274
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,897
I don't know how you say that
with a straight face.

275
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,433
I mean, it's just... it's ridiculous.

276
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,991
I'm serious this time.

277
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,367
Let's just leave
the country, you know?

278
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,201
Go to China.

279
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,740
Try our luck on the black market.

280
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,173
Why don't we just go outside?

281
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,938
We'll grab some random
person off the street,

282
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:39,943
drag them in here, you know...

283
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,309
Sounds good to me.

284
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,179
Drag them in and cut them open.

285
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,912
Hey, whatever it takes, right?

286
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,419
You worry too much,
you know that?

287
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,978
Oh.

288
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,648
They'll find me one.

289
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,455
It just takes a little time, that's all.

290
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,019
You're not going to like this.

291
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,657
Straight to the king.

292
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,225
Oh, nice hand!

293
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,794
Boat. Jacks over eights.

294
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,068
- Are you kidding me? Again?
- [laughs]

295
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,166
Come on, you're my son.

296
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,701
Can't hide anything
from your mother.

297
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,271
I think I need to go upstairs.

298
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,382
Don't stay up too late.

299
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,653
<i>Beresford Capital</i>
<i>opened higher today</i>

300
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:32,664
<i>after their announcement of the Dirasonic</i>

301
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,723
<i>This bodes well for</i>
<i>the New York-based company,</i>

302
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,167

<i>Still, rumors surrounding</i>
<i>the merger...</i>

311
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,691
I thought you might like a little drink.

312
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,320
Oh, maybe one. Thank you.

313
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,829
You're up late.

314
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,455
Something on your mind?

315
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,001
Got to get my family time in now.

316
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,264
You know, before some
smoothy whisks you away.

317
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,270
Yeah, right.

318
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,465
Like that's going to happen.

319
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,565
I don't know.

320
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,009
I think maybe somebody
had a little baby crush on Dr. Neyer.

321
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,172
I saw the way
you were looking at him.

322
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,239
I don't need anyone else.

323
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,047
I got you, Clay. Remember?

324
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,984
So, I closed Lambert today.

325
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,682
That means if we get
a hold of Mecter too,

326
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,123
that's 2,000 new jobs guaranteed,
plus new housing...

327
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,058
Do you remember him, Clay?

328
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,595
I remember bits.

329
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,690
Like what?

330
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,093
He died at Christmas.

331
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,935
Come on, don't you
remember anything else?

332
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,441
Sure, he was wearing a Santa suit,
and he fell down the stairs.

333
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,206
I mean from when he was alive, Clay.

334
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,945
I remember he smiled a lot.

335
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,150
Sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Beresford.

336
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,852
Uh, door was open.

337
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,326
What?

338
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,692
I just need your signature.

339
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,698
I know it's late,
but I want to get this out tonight.

340
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,734
Of course, Sam.
Thank you.

341
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,995
[Sam]
The Edmond "thank yous" are done,

342
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,161
your table's locked for the benefit,

343
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,795
and I put you down for the roast beef.

344
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,066
I know it's your favorite.

345
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,404
You're too good to me, Sam.

346
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:30,441
Well, if that will be all,
I... should be heading home.

347
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,450
- Good night, Mrs. Beresford.
- Night.

348
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,815
Mr. Beresford.

349
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,827
Sam!

350
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,861
- Sam.
- I'm tired, all right?

351
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,134
I just want to go home.

352
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,936
Actually, fuck it.

353
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,239
You got me hiding
my engagement ring, Clay.

354
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,143
What is wrong with you?

355
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,407
- Will you come under the umbrella?
- No.

356
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,005
I've been engaged for six months.

357
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,052
No one even knows I'm dating anyone.

358
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,984
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

359
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,044
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,181
If you won't even acknowledge me,
how do l...

361
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,352
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

362
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:19,091
For Christ's sake, Clay,
what are you doing?

363
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,359
You can't be in the rain.

364
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,095
Will you come inside
so we can get warm?

365
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,929
But she'll see.

366
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,971
Are you sure?

367
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,378
Unless you'd rather stand in the rain.

368
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,720
I should have done this
a long time ago.

369
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,284
She's not going to like it.

370
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,849
Come on.

371
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,794
I trusted you in my home, Samantha.

372
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,959
How could you come in here
and sneak around?

373
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:56,967
Please.

374
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,298
Clay, she lied to me to my face.

375
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,601
- She's a liar.
- I can't stay here forever.

376
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,301
I'm not asking you to.
Just... wait a bit.

377
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,400
Get to know each other first.

378
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,069
We've been together for a year.

379
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,045
Then wait till you're a little older.

380
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,843
How old were you
when you got married?

381
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,315
It's different. I was too young.

382
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,876
Clay, you've got your
whole life ahead of you.

383
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,319
Do I?

384
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,023
If you walk out that door,
you've made your choice.

385
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,457
You're making it for me.

386
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,573
Sam, wait.

387
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,206
Oh... oh, God.

388
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:48,049
Okay. Um...

389
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,452
Nope.

390
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,820
Here we go.

391
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,882
Look what we've got here.

392
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,295
All right, sweetie.

393
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,093
All right. Open up, honey.

394
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,464
You okay?

395
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,467
You okay?

396
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,935
I am so sorry.

397
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:07,199
I just needed to be acknowledged, that's all.

398
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,332
I'm going to go away
and leave you two alone, okay?

399
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,569
Marry me.

400
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,111
What?

401
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,510
Tonight. Right now.

402
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,842
Marry me tonight.

403
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,746
But it's the middle of the night.

404
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,081
I don't want to wait anymore.
We've waited long enough.

405
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,254
[sighs]
Really?

406
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,158
[Jack]
The minister is on his way,

407
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,597
and he's bringing
his wife as a witness.

408
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,067
How the hell did you
pull that one off?

409
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,331
Triple bypass last June.

410
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,997
I'm calling in a favor.

411
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,968
You're a good best man, Jack.

412
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,477
- Thank you.
- Okay, hold on.

413
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,479
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

414
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,310
- Come on, please! Please, please, please.
- We had this conversation.

415
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,543
Clay, I am pulling
80 hours a week, man.

416
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,984
I've gotta drag these
little moments out any way I can.

417
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,954
Just... Just one, okay?

418
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,717
[laughs]
You gotta take the lens cap off first.

419
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,760
Oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

420
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,159
Just one, just one.

421
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,357
Oh, man, look at that.

422
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,162
- An actual smile.
- [shutter clicks]

423
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,834
[sighs]

424
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,337
So proud of you.

425
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,638
[Man]
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

426
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,440
I, Samantha Jane Lockwood...

427
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,277
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

428
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,874
take you, Clayton Beresford, Jr...

429
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,749
to be my lawful wedded husband...

430
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,187
to be my lawful wedded husband...

431
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,452
to have and to hold...

432
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,517
to have and to hold...

433
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,858
[Minister]
from this night forward...

434
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,693
[Sam]
from this night forward...

435
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,165
for better, for worse...

436
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,031
for better, for worse...

437
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,663
for richer, for poorer...

438
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,037
for richer, for poorer...

439
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,168
[Minister]
in sickness and in health...

440
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,042
[Sam]
in sickness and in health...

441
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:59,346
till death do us part.

442
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,818
till death do us part.

443
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,137
Clay.

444
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,234
Clay, whoa!

445
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,710
[laughs]
Whoa!

446
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,837
What are you doing?

447
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,676
What do you think I'm doing?

448
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,181
[vibrating]

449
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,877
What is...

450
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,246
Clay.

451
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,484
[vibrating continues]

452
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,957
Clay.

453
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,828
They're the only ones with the number.

454
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,888
Holy shit.

455
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,825
I love you.

456
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,599
I love you, too.

457
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,396
Here.

458
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,249
There he is.

459
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,789
The man of the hour.

460
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,882
[Jack]
Now, what took you two so long?

461
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,517
Sam, this is Dr. Puttnam.

462
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,891
- Hello.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

463
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,894
I've heard a lot about you.

464
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,328
Clay's a lucky man.

465
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,387
I am.

466
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:21,558
[clatter]

467
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,296
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.

468
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,467
[Clay]
You'll have to excuse Penny.

469
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,097
She's not from around here.

470
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,335
You walk on the other side
of the road over there, huh, Penny.

471
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,503
Very funny.

472
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,603
Sorry I'm late.

473
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,705
Had a hard time getting a sitter.

474
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,647
Penny Carver. Nice to meet you.

475
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,548
Nice to meet you, too.
Sorry about him.

476
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,644
Oh, it's all right.
We're used to it by now.

477
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,849
So, D.C., gunshot to the head,

478
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,189
O-negative, perfect crossmatch.

479
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,160
Heart will be here in two hours.

480
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,060
And your mother's here.

481
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,098
What?

482
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,826
- Wait, she's here?
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,833
What? She's on the call sheet.

484
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,032
You certainly took your time.

485
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,474
Dr. Neyer's performing
this transplant across town.

486
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,738
Would you please clear it
with administration?

487
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,507
Actually, I'm staying right here.

488
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,275
What?

489
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,283
- Hello, Jonathan.
- Jack.

490
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,682
You two know each other?

491
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,219
Of course.

492
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,345
Dr. Jack Harper,

493
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:19,414
Head of Cardio
Varick University Medical.

494
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:23,450
Two mortgages, two ulcers,
two ex-wives.

495
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,861
You sound like my ex-wives.

496
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,126
You still fishing
in the East River, Jack?

497
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,293
Well, some of us
just don't have the time

498
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,701
to make it to the North Shore
every weekend.

499
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,672
Clay, this man has three malpractice suits
against him.

500
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,538
Three. I checked.

501
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,509
Four. l...

502
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,637
I think it's four, right, Jack?

503
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,045
You think this is funny?

504
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:51,378
Clayton, this time next year
I'll be Surgeon General.

505
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:54,153
I write textbooks on this procedure.

506
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,222
Really?

507
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,025
That's... That's great.

508
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:00,963
I, uh...

509
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,625
I sure hope you've read them, Jack.

510
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,931
Will you excuse us for a minute?

511
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,571
Look at me. Look at me.

512
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,633
This isn't about her.

513
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

514
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,241
He's my friend, Mother.

515
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,285
I trust him.

516
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,980
I really wish you'd start trusting me.

517
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,613
I'm sorry, darling.

518
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,089
The answer is no.

519
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,820
I wasn't asking for your permission.

520
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:44,438
All right, I'm going to leave you guys
for a minute, okay?

521
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,307
Thanks, Jack.

522
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,141
Looks nice.

523
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,446
Does it fit?

524
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,421
Yeah. It's perfect.

525
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,891
Quite a night we're having, huh?

526
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,321
I'm scared shitless.

527
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,557
I know. Me, too.

528
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,497
But, hey, you know what?

529
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,092
As soon as you get out of here,

530
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,162
we're going to start from scratch.

531
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,900
Get a little house on the beach.

532
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,408
- Mm-hmm.
- Do it right, you know?

533
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:19,409
Chase seagulls.

534
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,571
What do you say?

535
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:27,216
As soon as you get out,
I'll be right here.

536
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,987
You think my new heart will love you
as much as my old one?

537
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,598
Okay, lovebirds.

538
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:45,569
We gotta go.

539
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,367
All right.

540
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,067

541
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:53,578
I'll see you soon... wife.

542
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,439
Say that again.

543
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:59,040

546
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:30,546
Sometimes you have to hold the button down
for a while to get it to work.

547
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:36,578
I don't need your help.

Guys, I'm Dr. Lupin.

550

Uh, you can call me Larry.

551
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,634
I'd shake hands,
but, uh, heh, you know.

552
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:56,105
- Who is this? What's going on?
- I don't know.

553
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,609
Your colleague,
Fitzpatrick, got laryngitis.

554
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,406
They called me up
from Saint Mathew's.

555
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,538
I thought Fitzpatrick
was going to be here.

556
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,082
Yes, me, too, but we have Larry now.

557
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,881
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

558
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,654
We've been, um,
together a long time.

559
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,021
Sort of like a little family.

560
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,684
This is Dr. Puttnam.

561
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,524
I understand.

562
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:18,824
It's a pleasure, Doctor.

563
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,159
How's the patient feeling?

564
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,699
Okay.

565
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,291
Everything all right?

566
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,097
Just fine, Clay.

Hey, Penny.

568

Okay, Clay.

You just relax, all right?

574
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,217
The next time you see me,
this is all going to be over.

575

Be gentle with him, okay?

577
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,896
Okay, just gonna give you
a little oxygen here.

578
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,869
They already asked you
if you had anything

579
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,495
to eat or drink in the last four hours?

580
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,301
Yeah.

581
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,433
And you've had general anesthetic before?

582

Mm-hmm.

583
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,101
Good.

584
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,046
I read your pre-op assessment

585
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,642
and came up with a nice
little cocktail.

You're going to like this.

587

Hang on tight.

Oh, my God.

589
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,961
Yeah. That's Him all right.

Go ahead and count back
from ten for me, will you?

Hey, Larry, what did you use here?

Midazolam? Fentanyl? Hmm?

Yeah, with a little

00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,279
<i>[Clay]</i>
<i>No, Clay! Fuck!</i>

707
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,620
<i>Get back to Sam.</i>

708
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,217
Okay, we have a massive
heart attack, possible M. I.

709
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:51,922
<i>[Clay]</i>
<i>Come on, Jack. Get me back to Sam.</i>

710
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:52,929
What's his name?

711
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:54,932
<i>[Clay]</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

712
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,468
[echoing]
Stay with my voice, pal.

713
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,470
You're gonna be fine, okay?

714
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,903
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

715
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,872
<i>What the fuck?</i>

716
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:05,102
[Jack]
Okay, open him up nice and wide.

717
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,666
<i>Okay, it's happening again.</i>

718
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:07,677
<i>Okay, it's fine.</i>

719
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:08,735
<i>Just control it like before.</i>

720
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,041
<i>You can do this.</i>

721
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,140
<i>Here we go, here we go,</i>
<i>here we go, here we go.</i>

722
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,650
<i>Come on, man, just swallow it.</i>

723
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,346
<i>[repressed screaming]</i>

724
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,820
Hey, follow my voice, pal.

725
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,619
We got you.
Stay right with me, okay?

726
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,290
[wheezing]

727
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,589
There goes a rib.

728
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:26,824
Oh, that's going to hurt tomorrow.

729
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,729
<i>- [sucks in breath]</i>
<i>- Sorry, Clay.</i>

730
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,768
<i>Yeah, you better be fucking sorry.</i>

731
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,462
<i>Fucking asshole.</i>

732
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:33,469
<i>Okay, it's over.</i>

733
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,732
<i>They're... They're through.</i>

734
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,637
<i>They're all the way in now.</i>

735
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,300
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

736
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,106
<i>Just relax. The worst is over.</i>

737
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,579
<i>Jack's got you.</i>

738
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,411
<i>He... He's going to take care</i>
<i>of you, all right?</i>

739
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,609
<i>Just like he always does.</i>

740
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:47,743
Have a seat.

741
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,980
<i>[Clay]</i>
<i>Let him help you, Clay.</i>

742
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:51,818
...I kind of like to do
a follow-up with someone

743
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,084
after I've saved their life.

744
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,217
You don't feel grateful
or anything, do you?

745
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,590
<i>[Clay]</i>
<i>Get me to Sam, Jack.</i>

746
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,458
We're going to need a transplant.

747
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,191
You tell me. You're the doctor.

748
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,165
You do much fishing?

749
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,598
What do you do as a billionaire?

750
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,192
You just sit around and eat shrimp?

751
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,067
- You always keep your cell on...
<i>- [Clay] There she is.</i>

752
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,196
...and that would be it.

753
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,535
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Sound like fun?</i>

754
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,473
<i>You did it, Clay. You're back.</i>

755
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,067
Oh, and that'd be Clay.

756
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,873
- Awful table manners, always late.
<i>- Look at me.</i>

757
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,471
- You'll get used to it.
<i>- Look at me.</i>

758
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,016
[rifling]

759
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,312
[bang]

760
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,649
Oh! Holy shit, I'm sorry.

761
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,313
I...

762
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,152
[laughs]

763
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,156
This is embarrassing.

764
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,522
I thought you were
at your office...

765
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,618
<i>- I need your help, Sam.</i>
<i>- I came in to, um...</i>

766
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,788
<i>I need a place to hide, okay?</i>

767
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,094
So, nice to meet you, too.

768
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,633
My name's Sam.

769
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,532
<i>There we go, Clay.</i>

770
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,661
<i>You see?</i>

771
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,797
<i>Just let her take you away.</i>

772
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,068
<i>Go all the way back to the beginning.</i>

773
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,669
We are going to where
the other half lives.

774
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,504
Let me guess,

775
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,948
never been on the subway before.

776
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,153
No.

777
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,213
Never been to Brooklyn, either?

778
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,522
- To be perfectly honest, never.
- Wow.

779
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:07,691
Oh, you really shouldn't
be smoking these things.

780
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:10,929
<i>- I'll be with you soon, Sam.</i>
<i>- It's not good for you.</i>

781
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:15,200
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>I'll be with you soon.</i>

782
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:22,804
Miss, um... Ramos?

783
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,782
We're ready for you. Room 5.

784
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,148
Right down the end of the hall,
on your right.

785
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,119
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

786
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,890
Hi. How are you doing?

787
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:39,952
Hey.

788
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,090
Can I help you with something?

789
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,597
Haven't I... seen you around?

790
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,242
Guess not.

791
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,405
Sorry.

792
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,017
You have two rings on your finger.

793
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,814
What was that?

794
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,652
Why are you wearing two rings, Sam?

795
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,159
When?

796
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,789
Just before he got the call.

797
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:18,458
Lilith...

798
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,269
[Lupin] Who needs all
those extra nurses, anyway, huh?

799
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,835
[Puttnam]
Well, I'm sick of the cutbacks.

800
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,143
I mean, how can they ask us
to do this with five people?

801
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,184
[Jack]
Yeah. You want to clamp that?

802
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,318
[Puttnam]
Ah, that's good Miss Chen.

803
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,547
Heart came early.

804
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,147
Yeah, there she is.

805
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,749
Thanks, Penny.

806
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,054
Clear.

807
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,596
Look at her. She's a beauty.

808
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,130
He's a lucky man.

809
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,098
Oh, by the way,
I've got two tickets

810
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,863
to the Knicks,
third row, tonight, Penny.

811
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,426
- Any interest?
- No, thanks.

812
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:55,439
What, is it
too American for you?

813
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:58,169
<i>We're halfway home, Sam.</i>

814
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,235
See where you live?

815
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,835
<i>The new heart's already here.</i>

816
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,904
That's you. Right there.

817
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,779
<i>They're gonna put it in soon.</i>

818
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,943
Not that far away from
each other after all,

819
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,953
are we Clay?

820
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,548
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

821
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,721
<i>God, I miss you.</i>

822
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,026
Stay with me.

823
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,127
Just stay.

824
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:27,194
<i>We're almost there, Sam.</i>

825
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:30,264
<i>We're almost there.</i>

826
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,042
[Jack]
How are we doin', Penny?

827
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,409
He's looking good. He's stable.

828
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,072
What about you, Jack?
You wanna go to the Knicks tonight?

829
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,775
It might be good for you
to take the edge off.

830
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,818
I hate the Knicks.

831
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,284
Jesus, what is wrong
with you people?

832
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,581
I got third row.

833
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,522
Oh, shit.

834
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:54,759
Levatol, Nalapril, Digoxin.

835
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,965
He likes me to carry them around.

836
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:02,131
If I left it up to him,
he'd be popping 'em like M&Ms.

837
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,607
He could OD on
these things, you know?

838
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,507
Can't say I'll miss them.

839
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:10,605
A lot of cute purses I haven't
been able to use over the last year.

840
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,777
I didn't know you did that,

841
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,221
that you carried his meds around.

842
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,426
I tried not to like him.

843
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:30,126
I honestly did.

844
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,068
Lilith, I know
how much he means to you.

845
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,265
What do you want from me, Sam?

846
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:40,744
I want you to tell him
that he's as good as his father.

847
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:45,442
I want you to tell him
that it's okay to love me,

848
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,576
and I want you to tell me
that it's okay to love him back.

849
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:55,421
He's already lost one parent,
he can't lose another.

850
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,120
He needs you.

851
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:00,653
I'm not a bad person.

852
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,131
I mean, if you could
just give us your blessing...

853
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,694
Okay, just stop talking.

854
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,634
Just make sure
he takes his meds and...

855
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,609
stop talking.

856
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:15,612
What?

857
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,238
He has terrible allergies,
did you know that?

858
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,907
Especially in the spring.

859
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,419
Grass and flowers...

860
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:25,115
Don't think this means
I'm going to be visiting every week.

861
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,625
Okay. Okay, let go.

862
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:33,630
All right.

863
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:36,292
Still sleeping like a baby.

864
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,801
Okay, why don't you
take your break, Larry?

865
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,929
We've been at this for a while.

866
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,031
They've got a soda machine
in the waiting room.

867
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,668
Really? 'Cause I do
have to make a call.

868
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,905
Sure, go ahead,
you've got at least 20 minutes.

869
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,947
We don't need you for a while.

870
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:50,946
Well, thanks, guys.

871
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:51,947
Sure.

872
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,108
Thanks a lot.

873
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,448
Pickups. Need adrenaline.

874
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,748
Peanut.

875
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,381
Hey, if you need somebody
to go with you tonight,

876
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,255
to the game...

877
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,158
Thanks, Larry.

878
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,268
Jack?

879
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,808
What's the matter?
You all right?

880
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,304
I don't know if I can do this.

881
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,281
What is the problem?

882
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,442
Fitzpatrick is the problem.

883
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,348
He screwed us.

884
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,979
This guy's been watching everything I do.

885
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,784
Oh, come no, Jack. Larry's an idiot.

886
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,324
He doesn't know
what's going on here.

887
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,984
No, it's like he's
been sent here to spy on us.

888
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,392
I think they found out we've been pushing
Clay down the donor list.

889
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:39,395
<i>What?</i>

890
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,726
Did you smell his breath, Jack?

891
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,129
He's not a spy, he's a drunk.

892
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,395
He's probably in there right now
in the bar topping himself...

893
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,403
Hey, would you just be quiet?

894
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,403
He could be back any second.

895
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,803
Okay, then go stand guard.

896
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,740
Go on. Now! And find out
what happened to Fitzpatrick...

897
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:56,011
Hey, Jack, do not get paranoid.

898
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,014
No one knows.

899
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,073
I started this thing,
and I swear to you I will end this.

900
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,516
I am not going to jail.

901
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,110
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What?</i>

902
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,711
No one's going to jail.

903
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,417
Look, let's inject the heart, put it in,

904
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:08,516
and end this thing, okay?

905
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:09,958
<i>What the fuck?</i>

906
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,256
Nobody's on to anything.

907
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:12,956
We are in... the... clear.

908
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,658
We're gonna kill this guy,

909
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,700
and then we're gonna go get
a fucking martini, okay?

910
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:19,066
By the time Larry walks back in here,

911
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,105
he'll be toes up
on the slab downstairs.

912
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,764
<i>You gotta be fucking kidding me.</i>

913
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,171
He knows something's going on.

914
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,937
I just wanna be on bypass
before Larry gets back.

915
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,500
You get no arguments there.

916
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,772
<i>You gotta stand up.</i>

917
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,576
<i>You gotta stand up, Clay.</i>

918
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,277
<i>Take the tape off your eyes</i>
<i>and shit out of your throat,</i>

919
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:35,478
<i>and wake up.</i>

920
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,952
...is if we suddenly
stopped the procedure.

921
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,852
<i>That's it, there you go.</i>

922
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,390
<i>You can do it.</i>

923
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,052
<i>Just open your eyes, Clay.</i>

924
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,187
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

925
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:08,516
[Puttnam]
I'm not doing this by myself.

926
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,019
[gasps]

927
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,022
I'm telling you,
if this thing goes sour,

928
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,183
if this guy looks like he's
figuring something out,

929
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,920
I'm pulling the plug
on this whole thing so quickly.

930
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,086
I'm not kidding, Eugene.

931
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,720
Hey, will you help me
with these stitches, please?

932
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:22,497
[Jack]
I'm too young to go to jail right now.

933
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,330
This ain't even worth it.

934
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,369
We're fine, Jack...

935
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,132
<i>All right, now think.</i>

936
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:31,403
Do you know how many
bullshit malpractice lawsuits

937
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:32,943
there are in this country?

938
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:33,977
<i>Think, Clay.</i>

939
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,273
Hard-working doctors, that's just...

940
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,938
<i>Look closer.</i>

941
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,606
You know how many I got?

942
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:39,843
- Four.
- Yeah, I know.

943
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:40,941
<i>There's gotta be a way out of this.</i>

944
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,485
All for trying to
save people's lives.

945
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,020
It's a disgrace.

946
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,420
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>
<i>You're gonna be all right.</i>

947
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:50,294
<i>You're not gonna die.</i>

948
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,023
I'm sorry.
They called me out of nowhere.

949
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,725
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

950
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,200
Mm-hmm.

951
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,568
You know what? I'm gonna try
and find out what's going on.

952
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,629
- Yeah.
- Okay?

953
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,539
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

954
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:10,371
Hi. Excuse me.

955
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:12,177
I was wondering
if you knew the status

956
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,343
on the heart transplant patient?

957
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,545
Mr. Beresford?

958
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:17,553
Yeah.

959
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:19,214
I'll call you back.

960
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,281
He's doing just fine.

961
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,656
We're taking
good care of him. Don't worry.

962
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:25,025
Everything's going according to plan.

963
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:29,024
Really?
I just came from there.

964
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,335
What is it?

965
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,735
You're not a doctor at this hospital.

966
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:39,105
I mean, you don't work here, do you?

967
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,441
I'm Dr. Larry Lupin.
Pleasure to meet you.

968
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,739
Mr. Beresford's anesthesiologist.

969
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,010
Will you excuse me a minute?

970
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:55,581
Fitzpatrick got laryngitis.
They called me in from St. Matthews.

971
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,184
Oh.

972
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,626
I thought Fitzpatrick
was gonna be here.

973
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,529
Yes, me, too,
but we have Larry now.

974
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,897
The players may have changed,
but the game is still the same.

975
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:07,404
God, look how fucking obvious.

976
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:10,030
I understand.

977
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,768
This is Dr. Puttnam.

978
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,140
Pleasure. How's the patient doing?

979
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,577
Okay.

980
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,072
Everything all right?

981
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:20,310
I don't get it, Jack.

982
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,217
Why?

983
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,161
Is she asleep?

984
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,494
Oh, no, no. Everything's fine.

985
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,590
Just, um, just give her a kiss for me,

986
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,362
and tell her I'll be home soon.

987
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,700
Good. Thanks.

988
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,865
Say that again.

989
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,872
Wife!

990
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,705
What'd I ever do to you?

991
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,480
What did she do to you?

992
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:52,880
Huh?

993
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,248
How the fuck
could you do this to us?

994
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,479
[Puttnam]
What are you doing in here?

995
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:59,318
[Sam]
I wanted to see how it was going.

996
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,316
Sam.

997
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,124
How's it going? Is everything okay?

998
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:08,290
Yeah.

999
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:11,267
Sam.

1000
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,700
They're trying to kill me.

1001
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,739
I just had an interesting chat
with some guy named Larry.

1002
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,774
Everything's fine.
You shouldn't be in here.

1003
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:21,369
No, don't trust him, baby.

1004
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,912
He's lying to you.

1005
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,379
Are you sure everything's fine?

1006
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,939
There is nothing wrong.
Everything's under control.

1007
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,542
Bullshit.

1008
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,916
What the hell's going on in here?

1009
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,420
That's right. Come on, baby.

1010
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,423
Where the fuck is Fitzpatrick?

1011
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:36,051
I just spoke to him.
He's at home.

1012
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,721
What do you mean, he's at home?

1013
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,286
- He's backing out.
- He's backing out?

1014
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,298
What?

1015
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:43,298
He can't back out.

1016
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,891
Do you want me to call him back?

1017
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,527
No, he's an idiot.

1018
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:49,300
We'll deal with him later.

1019
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,898
What about this Larry guy?
Does he have a clue?

1020
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,841
None. What about her?

1021
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,105
Are you kidding?

1022
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,204
She's ready to adopt me.
Everything's fine.

1023
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,280
Everything is fine, right?

1024
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,483
Right?

1025
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:12,659
Jack, you okay?

1026
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,894
Jack?

1027
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,768
Get her a gown.

1028
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,065
What about Larry?

1029
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,732
I'll watch for him. Just hurry.

1030
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,113
[Penny]
Guys, finish putting him on bypass.

1031
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,279
Jack.

1032
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,260
It was my idea, Sam. You know?

1033
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,262
Jesus.

1034
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,390
I can pull the plug if I want to.

1035
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,334
Everything is working, Jack.

1036
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,030
Okay?

1037
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:55,163
There he is.

1038
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,730
- I got him to marry me.
- The man of the hour.

1039
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,298
The hard part's over.

1040
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,538
[Jack]
This is Dr. Puttnam. Sam.

1041
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,045
Sam, I've heard a lot about you.

1042
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:04,240
[crash]

1043
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:06,306
<i>Christ, they know her.</i>

1044
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:09,012
Sorry, I'm late.
I had a hard time getting a sitter.

1045
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,917
Penny Carver.
Pleasure to meet you.

1046
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,580
Nice to meet you, too.

1047
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,419
Sorry about him.

1048
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:15,891
I'm used to it by now.

1049
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,757
So...

1050
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:21,355
How the hell do they all know her?

1051
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,662
[Sam]
We didn't waste a year of our lives

1052
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,601
for nothing, did we, Jack?

1053
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,103
Nobody knows I worked your team.

1054
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,139
<i>What?</i>

1055
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,003
I changed my name.

1056
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,635
We're clear.
We're totally in the clear.

1057
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:36,111
[Jack]
Yeah, they're all mine.

1058
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,708
Kind of depressing to know that
your whole life can just fit on one wall.

1059
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,616
My dream is to one
day fill up this one.

1060
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,621
Jack, you know how much
we owe from the lawsuits.

1061
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,590
The insurance won't cover it.

1062
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:51,526
I can't just kill him, Sam.

1063
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,496
This is our only way out.

1064
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,931
Without this money, we're finished.

1065
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:02,700
He has to die.

1066
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,003
I am fucked.

1067
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,633
It's just money, Sam.

1068
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,543
I'd rather stay in debt than go to jail.

1069
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,580
Jesus, Jack.

1070
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:12,741
Grow some fucking balls.

1071
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:15,377
Hey, I started this
whole thing, remember?

1072
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,183
He landed on my table, I brought you in,

1073
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,688
I brought all y'all in.

1074
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:22,920
It's my choice.

1075
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,928
And I wasn't the one that nearly
screwed this whole thing up, was I?

1076
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,122
[Penny]
He's right, you know.

1077
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,063
I would've had that ring on my finger

1078
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,065
in two months.

1079
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,533
Really?

1080
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:32,796
Well, if you hadn't got knocked up,

1081
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,134
maybe you would've had
the chance, wouldn't you?

1082
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,902
[Jack]
Just go, Penny, all right?

1083
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,212
Jack, think about it.

1084
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:49,275
No more triple shifts.

1085
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:52,379
No more 30-hour days.

1086
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:56,688
Even if we settle the will, we're rich.

1087
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,389
You know what
100 million is four ways?

1088
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:06,233
He's a transplant patient, Jack.

1089
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,737
They all die eventually.

1090
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:12,207
Yeah.

1091
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,710
They all die eventually.

1092
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,780
Look at me.

1093
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,720
This isn't about her.

1094
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,553
I'm so sorry.

1095
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:31,493
I'm not risking your life
on some second-rate doctor.

1096
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:34,258
He's my friend, Mother. I trust him.

1097
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,993
I really wish
you'd start trusting me.

1098
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:40,695
[Jack]
Quickly. Watch the vein.

1099
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,205
All right, it's almost there.

1100
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:45,299
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1101
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,771
I got it.

1102
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:52,213
All right, I need some suction.

1103
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,751
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Please, God, no.

1104
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,616
- Just get that side, too.
- Okay.

1105
00:50:57,688 --> 00:50:59,519
Oh, no, please, God.

1106
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,387
No.

1107
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:06,022
Aah!

1108
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,791
[Penny]
It's right here.

1109
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:09,457
Thank you.

1110
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,158
You sure Larry's not close?

1111
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,601
[Penny]
We're fine. Don't worry.

1112
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:14,968
[Puttnam]
We gotta hurry all the same, okay, Jack?

1113
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,506
Let's just keep it moving.

1114
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,838
[Jack]
All right, just pass over the new heart.

1115
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,841
What?

1116
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,138
Pass over the new heart.

1117
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,838
But we haven't injected it yet.

1118
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,404
Pass it over.

1119
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,507
What are you doing?

1120
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,644
Where's the syringe?

1121
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,880
Give it to me.

1122
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,149
Come on.

1123
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,782
Move your fucking hand.

1124
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:38,624
Now, I want you to take this.

1125
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:44,300
Inject the heart,
and put it in the body, okay?

1126
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,103
You led us here.

1127
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:52,642
Finish what you started.

1128
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,610
Just do it, Jack.

1129
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,612
Let's get this over with.

1130
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:01,646
Sorry, baby.

1131
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,881
He really loved you, Sam.

1132
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,221
He didn't even know me, Jack.

1133
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,318
We never even met.

1134
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,363
Wait. Hold on.

1135
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,406
Holy shit.

1136
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,446
Oh, holy shit.

1137
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:52,899
Is he okay?

1138
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,234
Is everything okay?

1139
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,432
They wouldn't say.

1140
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,066
You were gone so long.

1141
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:00,075
- I know.
- I started...

1142
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:01,941
I know.

1143
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,674
I'm scared, too.

1144
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:16,123
Hey, guys.

1145
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,558
Survive without me?

1146
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,960
So far, so good. Smooth sailing.

1147
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,098
Forceps.

1148
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,998
Oh, you guys are flying.

1149
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:26,627
- Yeah.
- Watch your flow.

1150
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,929
Larry. Larry, Larry.

1151
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,771
Look at my eye.

1152
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:35,812
Come on, man. Can you see that?

1153
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,779
Why am I crying, huh?

1154
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:39,577
Something's wrong.

1155
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,778
Larry. Larry, look.

1156
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,447
Come on, man. Look at my eye.

1157
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,319
Come on, Larry, look!

1158
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,620
[Jack]
Pull it back so I can see...

1159
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,264
- Hold on.
- All right, here we are.

1160
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,234
- Okay.
- Clamp that.

1161
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:01,965
- Get me the suction.
- All right.

1162
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,234
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1163
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:06,538
Hold on. Hold on.

1164
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,475
Yeah. Yeah.
You got it. Come on.

1165
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,383
I'm sorry, I can't
go to the game tonight.

1166
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,387
My old lady and I have a date.

1167
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:24,285
You f...

1168
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,524
[indistinct chatter]

1169
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,657
[Puttnam]
Why don't I give you both tickets?

1170
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,360
- [Lupin] Really?
- [Puttnam] Sure.

1171
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,493
You can take your old lady.

1172
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,196
Make a night of it, go out on the town.

1173
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,641
Something's wrong.

1174
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,701
I can feel that something's wrong.

1175
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,406
What is it?

1176
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,913
I can't just sit here like this.

1177
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,145
They should have told us something by now.

1178
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,709
- Listen to me.
- No, you don't understand.

1179
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,449
He's not just my son.

1180
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,184
I was a kid when I had him.

1181
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:55,623
He's going to be fine.

1182
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,820
We've grown up together.
It's me and him.

1183
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,693
He's not going to die.

1184
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:04,791
Not now, not today.

1185
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,199
He's going to live.

1186
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,500
How can you be so sure?

1187
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:11,166
Because he's got too much to live for.

1188
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,775
Well, I've got a big
Halloween party tonight,

1189
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,544
but how about
I sneak out afterward?

1190
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,141
[Sam]
What's wrong with right now?

1191
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:23,652
Well, I can't. I'm...

1192
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,918
I know it's daylight
and all, but I missed you.

1193
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,788
You look beautiful, Sam.

1194
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,327
- I do?
<i>- Look at you.</i>

1195
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:32,362
[Clay]
Yeah, you do.

1196
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,896
I should tell you that more often.

1197
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:36,660
<i>What would the old man</i>
<i>think of you now?</i>

1198
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,437
<i>You lost it all, Clay.</i>

1199
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:45,669
<i>Everything he gave you, everything he made,</i>

1200
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,505
<i>it's gone.</i>

1201
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:51,537
<i>You gave it all away.</i>

1202
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:53,742
[Puttnam]
Heart's in.

1203
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,308
[Jack]
All right, pressure down.

1204
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:57,751
Pressure down.

1205
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,449
Okay, release the clamp.

1206
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,254
[Puttnam]
Cross-clamp released.

1207
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,188
Wait a minute.

1208
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:08,389
Wait, wait, wait.
Something's wrong.

1209
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:12,265
Okay, re... re-clamp.

1210
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,598
He's... He's fibbing.

1211
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,103
You getting anything?

1212
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:16,969
- Nothing.
- All right, all right.

1213
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,668
Charge paddles n... now.

1214
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,267
Come on. Now, Penny. Hurry.

1215
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:25,907
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke these things.

1216
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:28,383
It's not good for you.

1217
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,215
Especially with your condition.

1218
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:34,053
- My condition?
- Yep.

1219
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,591
How do you know
about my condition?

1220
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,388
<i>So many details.</i>

1221
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:39,554
I know a lot more
about you than you think.

1222
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,428
<i>- I didn't even see.</i>
- Is that a fact?

1223
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,932
Of course.

1224
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,765
<i>Christ, I missed everything.</i>

1225
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:50,398
<i>What was I looking at?</i>

1226
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:53,409
Was I looking at you?

1227
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:56,446
I hope you're happy, Sam.

1228
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,743
And I hope you get what you deserve.

1229
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,840
Got nothing?

1230
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:04,319
- Okay.
- Paddles to 20.

1231
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:06,151
- Amio's running.
- Charge.

1232
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:08,657
- [electrical crackle]
- Charge it again.

1233
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,158
- [defibrillator charging]
- [Penny] Charge.

1234
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:12,923
Are your lats okay?

1235
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:14,327
Charge it to 40, please.

1236
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:15,592
- [Penny] Jack.
- Jesus.

1237
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,861
[Jack]
Charge it one more time, please.

1238
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,232
<i>Don't fight it.</i>

1239
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:21,771
[Jack]
Just charge it one more time.

1240
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,430
[Penny]
Charge.

1241
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:25,998
- [electrical crackle]
- Marry me.

1242
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:27,134
What?

1243
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,542
<i>- Here we go.</i>
<i>- Tonight. Right now.</i>

1244
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,672
- Marry me.
- It's the middle of the night.

1245
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,811
[Puttnam]
We're losing him.

1246
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:39,822
[Puttnam]
We gotta get him back on bypass.

1247
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:40,822
[Jack]
No, no, no, not yet.

1248
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:43,086
Just one more time.

1249
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,889
[Puttnam]
It's over, Jack. He's done.

1250
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,020
We have to put him back on...

1251
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,654
[Jack]
What about the adrenaline?

1252
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:48,857
[Puttnam]
It won't make a difference.

1253
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,264
A shot of adrenaline, please.

1254
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:53,360
Please!

1255
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,971
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1256
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,133
Jack.

1257
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,403
- Sure there's no air?
- No air.

1258
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,876
I'm looking at it.
There's no air.

1259
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,742
[Puttnam]
It's over, Jack.

1260
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,641
Shit.

1261
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:09,811
[Penny]
I'm sorry, Jack.

1262
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,823
[Jack]
It's my fault.

1263
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,551
[Puttnam]
No.

1264
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,092
[Jack]
It's my fault.

1265
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,525
[Penny]
Jack, come on.

1266
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,723
[Jack]
No, it is. It's...

1267
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,858
There's gotta be
something I could have done,

1268
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,732
something I could have tried.

1269
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:29,738
Jack, you did everything
you could do.

1270
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,036
Did I?

1271
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:34,669
You did all you could do, Jack.

1272
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:37,270
It was a bad heart.

1273
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,009
[machines powering down]

1274
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,716
We should tell the family.

1275
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,482
Any volunteers?

1276
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,289
I'll do it.

1277
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,853
I'm the one that should
be talking to them.

1278
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,934
- I'll go with him.
- Yeah.

1279
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,064
Thank you.

1280
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:17,583
So?

1281
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:19,144
He rejected the heart.

1282
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:24,250
We did everything
we could, but the...

1283
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,160
the organ failed, and I am so sorry.

1284
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,768
The organ failed?

1285
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:37,534
Yes. It wouldn't respond
to the procedure.

1286
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:40,098
But in cases like this,
it's not uncommon for...

1287
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:43,340
Don't you mean you failed?

1288
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,404
No, we...

1289
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:48,007
we did everything that we could.

1290
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,110
It's just an imperfect procedure.

1291
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:52,417
Say it.

1292
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:53,956
Say what?

1293
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:57,585
I want to hear you say it.
I want to hear you say...

1294
00:59:57,661 --> 01:00:00,289
you failed my son.

1295
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:07,136
It shouldn't have been you.
It should never have been you.

1296
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:10,367
I fucking knew it.

1297
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:15,534
I'm... I'm sorry, Sam.

1298
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:24,010
Um...

1299
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,679
I'm afraid we're going
to need your permission

1300
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,086
to take him off bypass.

1301
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,793
What?

1302
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,988
We'll need your permission.

1303
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:35,964
I'm so sorry to have to ask.

1304
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,932
I don't understand.

1305
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,628
He's alive?

1306
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:45,801
Yes, but his blood's being
pumped by a machine.

1307
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:46,808
He has no heart.

1308
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:48,902
Then get him another heart.

1309
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:49,946
You don't understand.

1310
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:52,311
His blood type's too rare.

1311
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:53,440
We don't have one.

1312
01:00:56,753 --> 01:01:00,689
I'm sorry. It's... It's over.

1313
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,554
Thank you.

1314
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:15,133
I'll be in the hallway.

1315
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,838
Lilith...

1316
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:23,106
Could you leave me
alone for a minute?

1317
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:25,681
Okay.

1318
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,602
It's done.

1319
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:55,867
Okay.

1320
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:53,461
[Clay]
Hey.

1321
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,696
Hey.

1322
01:02:56,673 --> 01:02:58,641
What are you doing?

1323
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,037
Hey.

1324
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,416
Just wanted to see
if you needed anything.

1325
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:13,422
Wanted to see how you were doing.

1326
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:17,551
I know it's hard to even think about
anything else right now, but...

1327
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:22,096
Are you okay?

1328
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,658
You okay?

1329
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:36,977
What are you doing here?

1330
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:39,379
I wasn't staying
out there without you.

1331
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:46,051
She's in here somewhere.

1332
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,919
Look around.

1333
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,194
God damn it.

1334
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:57,790
Bailey, call the code.

1335
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,630
It's too late.

1336
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,733
All right,
let's prep her for surgery.

1337
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,314
I don't understand.

1338
01:04:12,382 --> 01:04:15,408
You're going to live, Clay.

1339
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:19,683
Think I'll take it from here, Jack.

1340
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:20,882
It's too late.

1341
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:25,752
We did everything we could,
but the body rejected the heart.

1342
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:28,093
Well, I think we solved that problem.

1343
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:32,693
I have a strong heart, Clay.

1344
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:33,861
[Neyer]
Let's go.

1345
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:35,996
Let's prep her for transplant.

1346
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:38,768
Always have.

1347
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,548
You can go.
We've been prepped.

1348
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:46,843
What do you mean?

1349
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,406
You can run.

1350
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:50,180
Police will be here soon.

1351
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,112
What'd you use, Jack?

1352
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:56,283
Formaldehy... No, wait.

1353
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,451
Adriamycin.

1354
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:59,290
Right.

1355
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,160
Less residue.

1356
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,029
[Penny]
Guys.

1357
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,567
[Puttnam]
Jack, come on. Let's go.

1358
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,662
Jack, what are you doing?

1359
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,104
Let's go. Now, Jack.

1360
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:16,301
What the hell happened to you?

1361
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,182
I told you not to trust them.

1362
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,313
I don't get it.

1363
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,856
You're telling me that you knew?

1364
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:31,416
No, no. Not at first.

1365
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,622
I had no idea.

1366
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,564
She did everything right.

1367
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:42,196
And then, she made one little mistake.

1368
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,433
She left her purse in the waiting room.

1369
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,408
Forget ethics.

1370
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,001
You got five minutes.

1371
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,443
You know where I'll be.

1372
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:53,209
I don't trust anyone else.

1373
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,183
It has to be you.

1374
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:58,152
The mail, Clay.

1375
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:00,451
She still had her mail.

1376
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:02,787
Wait. Jonathan?

1377
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:11,992
Haven't I see you around?

1378
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:14,366
[Lilith]
Only took me a second to put it together.

1379
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,268
Sometimes you have
to hold the button down

1380
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,807
for a while to get it to work.

1381
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:21,207
[Lilith]
She'd been to that hospital before.

1382
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:23,802
You're not a doctor at this hospital.

1383
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:29,011
I mean, you don't work here, do you?

1384
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:30,211
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1385
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:36,016
[Clay]
Why didn't you just say something?

1386
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,686
[Lilith]
There was no time.

1387
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:42,629
You were dying, you needed a heart.

1388
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:45,133
I had no choice.

1389
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,897
[machine beeping]

1390
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:51,868
[Neyer]
Get a DLP vent ready.

1391
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,203
[Woman]
Doctor, how does he look?

1392
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:55,744
Terrible.
He's been on bypass too long.

1393
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:57,040
Let's prep the new organ.

1394
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,637
Still going to attempt transplant?

1395
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:01,047
Well, I might
have to do an autopsy.

1396
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,547
Give me a knife and a flat vent.

1397
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,853
Sorry, Lilith.

1398
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:11,325
I'm so sorry.

1399
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:17,361
[Woman]
I'm looking for it.

1400
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:19,230
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1401
01:07:19,302 --> 01:07:24,399
Beresford transplant...
operating room B.

1402
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:26,806
Becky, it's me.

1403
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,434
Listen, get her up
and get her dressed now.

1404
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,001
I'm coming back.

1405
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,979
Becky, just do it, okay?

1406
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,745
My car is downstairs.

1407
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:42,418
