1
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:13,967
Ibelieve that in both
spirit and substance...

2
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:17,599
...our tax system
has come to be un-American.

3
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:22,306
Death and taxes may be inevitable,
but unjust taxes are not.

4
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:26,351
The first American Revolution was sparked
by an unshakable conviction:

5
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,149
Taxation without representation
is tyranny.

6
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,588
Two centuries later,
a second American....

7
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,764
-You're pushed.
-We got a game going.

8
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:46,838
-What kind of stakes?
-Five and ten.

9
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:49,441
-Is the man gonna play?
-After the speech.

10
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,043
Outstanding.

11
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,741
Post three. I got a shake.

12
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,061
Right there, fella!

13
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,401
I'm ready to die!

14
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,328
Nobody's gonna die.

15
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:28,168
Look, you and I are going
to go downstairs and talk.

16
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,638
Death to Israel and America,
and all the enemies of Islam!

17
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:36,447
I understand. Look, I'm gonna
put my gun away, all right?

18
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:37,811
We're gonna go talk.

19
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:39,516
I am a martyr!

20
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:44,356
I will bomb myself on you
and all the enemies of Islam!

21
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,576
Let's get out of here, Jimmy.

22
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:06,679
Go play some cards, get drunk.

23
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:17,523
I'm getting too old for this shit.

24
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,158
Get the 50s ready, guys.

25
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:59,771
Gilbert. Booze. Free for me.

26
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:02,373
-Did you bet with me or against me?
-Against you.

27
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:05,477
-You blew it.
-Against you.

28
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:08,671
Okay, you guys!
It's the moment of truth here.

29
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:10,372
-Oh, shit.
-Come on!

30
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:14,316
I told you guys,
never bet against me.

31
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:17,047
Come on, Petievich,
get a half a yard in here.

32
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:21,293
To my partner, Jimmy Hart...

33
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,691
...whose skill in spotting bad paper
is only exceeded by his expertise...

34
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:27,765
-...in rigging a safety Iine.
-Hear, hear!

35
00:10:27,934 --> 00:10:30,061
How about a speech, boss? Speech.

36
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:33,205
You know, I've been in
this racket 25 years, you guys.

37
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:35,863
And I don't think anybody...

38
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,533
...has been put in harm's way
more than I have...

39
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:42,738
-...by this hotshot over here. But--
-Don't know how you work with him.

40
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:47,318
Seriously speaking, if I'm
going in to bag somebody...

41
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:50,284
...there's nobody I'd rather have
backing me up.

42
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:52,083
AII right! Hear, hear!

43
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:54,692
Later, AIvarez. Next time
you can make a jump with me.

44
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,658
-Come on. It's the same thing in your work.
-What?

45
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,527
You push too hard. You take it too
personally. You'II never reach retirement.

46
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:04,568
-I'm not interested in retirement.
-Such a hot dog. See you Iater.

47
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:07,638
Hey, come here, come here.
Got something for you.

48
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:11,573
Fucking AIvarez trying to pass
a funny 50 on us, huh?

49
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:14,474
Your retirement present.

50
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,912
-You trying to get rid of me?
-It was burning a hole in my truck.

51
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:24,986
That's a beauty, Richie.

52
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:27,148
They tell me the trout
jump all over it.

53
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:30,625
-You gonna Iet me use it?
-Come and see me, you can use it.

54
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:33,992
I'm gonna miss you, amigo.

55
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:38,530
Yeah. Me too.

56
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:41,400
Hey, Iisten, I know you got
something going tomorrow.

57
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:44,839
-You reading my mail again?
-Masters, right? Where?

58
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,706
You ain't going out there alone.

59
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,746
I got three more days on the job.
I want to make the most of it.

60
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,383
What's the point of the two of us
running down one Iead?

61
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:54,485
The point is that we're partners, right?

62
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,918
Sure we are.
And when the bust goes down...

63
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,217
...you're gonna be there with me,
Iike always. Okay, partner?

64
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:03,889
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

65
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,559
You give me a call
when you get back.

66
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:28,639
-Shitbag.
-Buddy...

67
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:32,072
...you're in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

68
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:41,212
Come on, come on!

69
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:58,962
-Do you know what we got?
-Nothing.

70
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:49,871
-Anything around back?
-Check the trailer.

71
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:51,413
Trailer's clear.

72
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:55,276
Anything around back?

73
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:58,853
CIear over here.

74
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:01,514
Who is it?

75
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:05,755
-John Vukovich.
-What do you want?

76
00:23:05,924 --> 00:23:08,222
I'd Iike to speak to you if I could.

77
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:14,961
I'm sorry about Jimmy Hart.

78
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:18,667
Jimmy was more than my partner, pal.

79
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:21,533
He was my best friend
for seven years.

80
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:24,301
He was the most righteous guy
I ever knew.

81
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:26,740
He had two days to go,
and that was it.

82
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:30,313
I can't understand why somebody would
waste him over a counterfeit beef.

83
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:33,315
Rick Masters killed him.

84
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,749
See, Jimmy got too close.

85
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:39,755
We had a tail on him and his mule for
six months, but we couldn't make the plant.

86
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:42,325
Jimmy went to check that warehouse
near Lancaster...

87
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:45,019
...because he found out it was rented
under a phony name.

88
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:46,528
But I don't know.

89
00:23:46,698 --> 00:23:49,258
For some reason he wanted
to go out there by himself.

90
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:52,028
Now you need a partner.

91
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:53,967
Let me tell you something, amigo.

92
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:56,733
I'm gonna bag Masters,
and I don't give a shit how I do it.

93
00:23:56,908 --> 00:23:58,343
I hear you.

94
00:24:05,717 --> 00:24:07,275
Can I talk to you for a minute?

95
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:10,285
You must be a mind reader.
I was just gonna call you.

96
00:24:10,455 --> 00:24:12,889
I've decided to Iet Vukovich
work with you.

97
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:17,819
-Do I have a choice?
-Oh, is there someone else you'd prefer?

98
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:20,088
You're welcome to fill out
a form 19...

99
00:24:20,264 --> 00:24:22,755
...Iist all the reasons
you'd rather not work with him.

100
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:26,267
Your input would be
strictly confidential.

101
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:29,764
Yeah. Forget it.

102
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:33,839
What is it you wanted to
talk about?

103
00:24:42,754 --> 00:24:46,155
One-way ticket to San Francisco, Mr. Cody.
How would you Iike to pay?

104
00:24:46,324 --> 00:24:49,691
-In cash.
-That will be $45 one-way.

105
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:50,987
AII right.

106
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:09,101
Federal agent. Excuse me. I'd Iike to see
the bills that man just handed you.

107
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:20,190
You wouldn't have a pencil with an eraser
I could use, would you?

108
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:21,916
-Sure. Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

109
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:45,445
U.S. Secret Service!

110
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:47,777
Hold it, man! Where you going?

111
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,401
Get out of the way!

112
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:42,834
Excuse me, miss.

113
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:00,523
Hey, what the hell!
You some kind of freak?

114
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:18,732
Freeze, asshole!

115
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,309
U.S. Secret Service.

116
00:27:20,478 --> 00:27:23,447
You're under arrest
for possession of counterfeit--

117
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:26,105
-You're making a mistake!
-Get up there and shut up!

118
00:27:26,284 --> 00:27:29,378
-I'm a businessman. I'm a businessman.
-Put your hands back here!

119
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:32,421
Stop it, asshole!
I'II blow your head off!

120
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,924
U.S. Secret Service. I'm arresting this guy
for counterfeiting.

121
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:39,085
Freeze!

122
00:27:39,263 --> 00:27:40,753
-Who are you?
-Secret Service!

123
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,999
I just came in to take a Ieak.

124
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,168
Morning. Let's go!

125
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:50,034
Get the bag, John.

126
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:11,150
You got balls coming here.

127
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,092
How you making it?

128
00:28:13,264 --> 00:28:16,563
Like every other swinging dick
in this place makes it:

129
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:18,565
Day by motherfucking day.

130
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:20,135
UIcer acting up?

131
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:22,795
I want to know when
you're gonna get me out.

132
00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:25,704
I want you to be patient a Iittle Ionger, Carl.

133
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:28,174
I got caught carrying for you.

134
00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:30,439
Now it's my turn
for some consideration.

135
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:32,776
You have my word, you won't do
the whole nickel.

136
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,351
-What does that mean?
-Grimes is the best Iawyer in the state.

137
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,149
It'II either be an appeal bond
or a sentence reduction.

138
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:44,420
And the check is in the mail and I Iove you
and I promise not to come in your mouth.

139
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:46,790
I'm doing everything I can.

140
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,157
Carl...

141
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:52,427
...we gotta talk about Waxman.

142
00:28:52,603 --> 00:28:54,127
Well, what about him?

143
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:58,002
He was your Iast stop before the airport.

144
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:00,234
What are you saying?

145
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:02,936
He said you never delivered
the package.

146
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,984
What do you mean?
He says I--? He never got it?

147
00:29:09,153 --> 00:29:12,589
I counted out 600 grand
right there on his desk.

148
00:29:12,757 --> 00:29:15,885
I had it wrapped in $10,000 packages
Iike you told me.

149
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,460
He put it in a safe right behind his desk.

150
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:21,462
He said you called, postponed delivery...

151
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:23,862
...and the next thing he heard,
you were busted.

152
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:25,798
He's a Iying son of a bitch!

153
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,837
He's probably the motherfucker
who did me.

154
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:32,134
He ratted me to the feds.
I'II kill him when I get out.

155
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:35,836
I'm gonna give that fucking scumbag
a serious headache.

156
00:29:36,013 --> 00:29:38,277
May God strike me dead
if I don't waste him.

157
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:40,076
Your visit's over.

158
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:51,121
Don't forget about me.

159
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:54,731
I won't.
You have my word on that.

160
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:59,468
Hell, I've done everything
humanly possible.

161
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:02,299
At this point,
I don't see any alternative.

162
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:04,566
Your friend Cody's
gonna have to do some time.

163
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:06,505
Why is he being held
without bail?

164
00:30:06,677 --> 00:30:09,202
He wants to know
and I can't give him an answer.

165
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,645
Suspicion of murdering
a federal agent named Jim Hart.

166
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:15,217
You told me you could arrange
an appeal bond.

167
00:30:15,386 --> 00:30:18,048
Even if the judge granted it,
it's only a postponement.

168
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:21,623
-I can't fucking tell--
-The guy got caught holding 40 grand.

169
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:23,020
What does he expect?

170
00:30:23,194 --> 00:30:26,925
He'II have to do a Iittle
to keep the prosecutor happy.

171
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:29,123
How much time?

172
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,665
Say, three.

173
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,997
No, no. He can't do it.

174
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:38,664
He'II cave in on me.

175
00:30:38,843 --> 00:30:41,243
What can he give them?

176
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:43,508
Everything.

177
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:57,652
-So, what's up?
-Can you give me anything on Masters?

178
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:02,630
There's a guy in Pasadena.

179
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,325
He's a Iawyer or something.
Used to represent hippies.

180
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:07,903
What's his name?

181
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:12,441
-Waxman. Max Waxman.
-Waxman. What's his story?

182
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,511
I think he's moving paper
for Masters.

183
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,512
Good. Is there anything
I can do for you?

184
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:20,946
My kid's coming in this weekend
from Las Vegas.

185
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:23,609
-You got a kid?
-Yeah. His name's Christopher.

186
00:31:23,788 --> 00:31:25,483
He Iives with his father
down there.

187
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:28,181
-Five hundred okay?
-Well, I was kind of hoping--

188
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,021
There's more if there's a bust.
You know the game.

189
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:41,953
-I had a bad dream Iast night.
-Tell me.

190
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:45,999
I was on-stage, and people
were burning me with cigarettes.

191
00:32:46,168 --> 00:32:48,432
Serena once told me
she writes her dreams down.

192
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:51,129
-She keeps them in a Iittle book.
-Who's Serena?

193
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:55,667
What did Carl say?

194
00:32:55,845 --> 00:32:58,279
He says Max ripped us off.

195
00:32:58,447 --> 00:32:59,709
Do you believe him?

196
00:32:59,882 --> 00:33:01,747
Looks that way.

197
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:03,977
What are we going
to do about it?

198
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:07,448
Take care of our problem.

199
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:33,175
Surveillance Iog, U.S. Treasury field office,
Los Angeles.

200
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:35,613
Office of attorney Max Waxman...

201
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:38,447
...corner of Walnut
and Los Robles streets.

202
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:42,853
This is day three,
January 1 1th, 2200 hours...

203
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:45,425
...reports of Agents Vukovich and Chance.

204
00:33:47,597 --> 00:33:49,656
Looks Iike he's got a guest.

205
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:51,925
He must Iike tall women.

206
00:33:58,374 --> 00:33:59,671
What a guy.

207
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:13,812
What is happening?

208
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,924
Long time, no see.

209
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:22,625
Heard you were on stage again.

210
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:25,062
What does Ricky-boy think
about that?

211
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:49,619
-Quantity?
-125 grand.

212
00:34:52,428 --> 00:34:54,089
I've seen better.

213
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:58,162
I'II give you 10 points
for the package.

214
00:34:58,334 --> 00:35:01,326
-Twenty points is the price.
-Where am I gonna get 20 points?

215
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,996
Off the back of a turnip truck?
Tell Rick he can kiss my ass.

216
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:07,165
Twenty points or I'm out of here.

217
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:15,848
What do you hear from Cody?

218
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:17,508
Problems.

219
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:23,090
I know you and Rick had your doubts
about me on this Cody thing...

220
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:25,489
...and I want to tell you
I hope that's over with.

221
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:28,528
I am straight with Rick.
I would never fuck with Rick.

222
00:35:28,698 --> 00:35:31,166
He never talks to me
about his business.

223
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:36,600
He told me to tell you if you Iike the paper,
he wants your order. Now.

224
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:38,904
No problem. That's cool.

225
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:51,443
I'd Iove to make a jump
in the rain.

226
00:35:52,254 --> 00:35:54,688
You ever do any base-jumping?

227
00:35:54,857 --> 00:35:57,155
It's great.

228
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:59,851
I used to jump off garages
when I was a kid.

229
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:07,599
Can I bring you something else?

230
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,398
-No, thanks, Father.
-It's great.

231
00:36:16,245 --> 00:36:18,713
Listen, why don't you make a jump
with me sometime?

232
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:22,044
-Yeah?
-Yeah, you'd Iove it. It's fabulous.

233
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:24,948
Once you get over the first fear,
it's a piece of cake.

234
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:29,615
It's the greatest feeling you'II ever have.
FIoat out, your balls go into your throat.

235
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,885
I think I'II take a pass, partner.

236
00:36:32,595 --> 00:36:34,961
You know, I could help you...

237
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:37,292
...if you ever get in trouble.

238
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:40,729
-You know what I mean?
-No.

239
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:45,796
Not here.

240
00:37:04,827 --> 00:37:06,658
I Iove the rain.

241
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:09,320
Yeah. It's groovy.

242
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:13,133
Come on.

243
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,967
Take off your glasses.

244
00:37:22,178 --> 00:37:24,112
Come here.

245
00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:40,525
-How you doing, Max?
-Oh, Christ.

246
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:43,221
First you rip me off,
then you set up Carl...

247
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:45,629
-...now you want to fuck my Iady.
-Man...

248
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:48,065
...she came on to me, man.
I swear it.

249
00:37:48,237 --> 00:37:50,467
Oh, what a tragedy.

250
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,199
I want my 600 K.

251
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:56,071
I didn't have anything to do
with getting Cody set up.

252
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:59,009
Do you know that your house
is under surveillance?

253
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:02,173
You know you're Iiving Iike
a fucking animal in the zoo?

254
00:38:04,854 --> 00:38:06,321
Get up!

255
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,400
Open up, Max. Make good
and we'II be friends again.

256
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:33,206
-Rick! Look out!
-Come here.

257
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,513
He's Iooking for something. Rick!

258
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,035
18th-century Cameroon.

259
00:39:01,577 --> 00:39:02,874
Yes...

260
00:39:03,946 --> 00:39:06,710
-...your taste is in your ass.
-No, Jesus, no!

261
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:27,568
Police!

262
00:39:27,736 --> 00:39:29,601
Police officer!

263
00:39:29,772 --> 00:39:31,239
Open the door!

264
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:36,069
Police! You inside, open the door!

265
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:39,610
Open this door! Police!

266
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:47,852
What's going on?

267
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:49,320
-Get up!
-What the fuck?

268
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:52,051
The whole caper's gone. Come on!

269
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:53,626
Shit!

270
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:23,248
-What's that?
-I took it out of Waxman's office.

271
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,953
It's some kind of dealer's code.

272
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:12,973
John, he's got all his delivery dates
in here.

273
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:16,805
He's got no names,
but he's got amounts, initials.

274
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:19,812
Look at this: "R.M., R.M."
Every other page.

275
00:41:19,982 --> 00:41:23,577
It's a crime scene. The book is evidence.
What if the cop remembers it's missing?

276
00:41:23,752 --> 00:41:27,415
Shit, that rookie couldn't remember what
he saw. He wasn't in there Iong enough.

277
00:41:30,793 --> 00:41:32,522
You shouldn't have done it.

278
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,623
What are you trying to tell me, amigo?

279
00:41:41,403 --> 00:41:43,530
If you feel strongly about it,
I'II hand it over.

280
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:47,073
That's not what I'm saying, okay?
That's not what I'm saying at all.

281
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:50,341
Just don't put words
in my mouth, all right?

282
00:41:50,512 --> 00:41:52,912
So you won't carry your weight
if something goes down?

283
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:55,550
We could've got shit-canned
for this Iittle trick.

284
00:41:55,718 --> 00:41:58,186
If you expect me to take heat,
tell me before you do it.

285
00:41:58,354 --> 00:42:00,151
If I had asked,
what would you have said?

286
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:03,689
That the cops would have Iet us copy
the diary after it was booked.

287
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,657
I wouldn't have done it if I was
with somebody I didn't trust.

288
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:11,062
Look, I'm no snitch.

289
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:17,170
Hey, John, Waxman just gave us
Rick Masters on a plate.

290
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:53,659
Who's that?

291
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:55,531
It's me.

292
00:44:12,721 --> 00:44:15,155
Too bad about Max.

293
00:44:15,324 --> 00:44:19,021
If you'd have caught him dirty, he'd have
done anything to keep out of the joint.

294
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:20,684
Like you?

295
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:36,702
How much do I get for the information
I gave you on Waxman?

296
00:45:36,872 --> 00:45:39,670
No arrest, no money.

297
00:45:39,842 --> 00:45:41,469
It's my fault he's dead?

298
00:45:41,643 --> 00:45:43,941
It took me six months
to get next to him.

299
00:45:44,113 --> 00:45:45,512
I've got expenses, you know.

300
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:47,911
Uncle Sam don't give a shit
about your expenses.

301
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,381
You want bread, fuck a baker.

302
00:45:53,055 --> 00:45:56,286
Someday, some guy I set up
for you is gonna snuff me.

303
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:59,484
It isn't too hard to figure out
who an informant is.

304
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:05,924
You gonna stay a while?

305
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:09,594
No. I gotta go.

306
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:15,176
I got something for you.

307
00:46:15,344 --> 00:46:16,572
I'm here.

308
00:46:22,084 --> 00:46:25,053
A dealer from San Francisco's
coming into L.A. next week...

309
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,711
...with 50 grand
to buy stolen diamonds.

310
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,723
The stuff that was Iifted
from the Bel Air Hotel.

311
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:33,020
He's a Chinaman connected
to people in Hong Kong.

312
00:46:33,195 --> 00:46:35,925
I told you. I'm only interested
in play dough.

313
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:40,461
I was reading about the stars.

314
00:46:40,636 --> 00:46:44,436
It talked about how the stars
are the eyes of God.

315
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:46,904
I think it's true, don't you?

316
00:46:47,075 --> 00:46:49,771
No. I don't.

317
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:55,444
If you had any real balls,
you'd jump off that bridge.

318
00:46:59,855 --> 00:47:03,484
The same thing happened to Max
could happen to me, you know.

319
00:47:06,628 --> 00:47:09,096
Did you hear what I said?

320
00:47:09,264 --> 00:47:10,993
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

321
00:47:13,202 --> 00:47:15,261
Can I ask you something?

322
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:18,129
Sure.

323
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:22,103
What would you do if I stopped
giving you information?

324
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:27,004
Why?

325
00:47:29,918 --> 00:47:31,886
I'd just Iike to know.

326
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:35,885
I'd have your parole revoked.

327
00:47:41,196 --> 00:47:42,561
You mean that?

328
00:47:43,765 --> 00:47:45,392
You'd do that?

329
00:48:33,782 --> 00:48:35,215
Man, why are you chasing me?

330
00:48:35,384 --> 00:48:36,749
Why are you running?

331
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:38,819
Because you're chasing me, man!

332
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:40,249
What do you want?

333
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:42,822
U.S. Secret Service!

334
00:48:42,991 --> 00:48:44,253
-Get over there!
-Okay, okay!

335
00:48:44,426 --> 00:48:46,018
-Against the fence!
-Be cool, man.

336
00:48:46,195 --> 00:48:48,755
Hands over your head, shitbag!
Come on, come on!

337
00:48:48,931 --> 00:48:51,559
Get your hands behind your head!
Turn around!

338
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:52,995
What the hell is this, huh?

339
00:48:53,168 --> 00:48:55,159
I swear to God, I don't know nothing
about it!

340
00:49:18,293 --> 00:49:20,454
I want to know where Masters prints!

341
00:49:23,832 --> 00:49:25,629
I'm gonna throw your ass
over the bridge!

342
00:49:25,801 --> 00:49:28,395
Talk to me or I throw your ass
over the bridge!

343
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:31,061
I don't know!
I don't know where he prints!

344
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,936
Nobody does! Nobody, I swear to God!

345
00:49:36,144 --> 00:49:39,011
He was in Terminal Island
when I met him.

346
00:49:39,181 --> 00:49:41,843
He was doing time for armed robbery.

347
00:49:42,017 --> 00:49:46,477
That was, oh, 1978.

348
00:49:46,655 --> 00:49:49,419
I was asked to give a talk
to the inmates...

349
00:49:49,591 --> 00:49:51,718
...Iook at some of their work.

350
00:49:53,195 --> 00:49:56,631
Masters had talent.
You could see that.

351
00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:01,493
I went to his studio one time, and he was
burning a couple of paintings...

352
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,002
...that I thought were quite beautiful.

353
00:50:04,172 --> 00:50:07,005
Do you think you might know
where that studio was...

354
00:50:07,175 --> 00:50:08,836
...remember what it Iooked Iike?

355
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:12,310
That was downtown
past the railroad tracks.

356
00:50:12,681 --> 00:50:14,774
There's an old warehouse...

357
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:17,350
...and there's a Chinese character on it.

358
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:48,641
-Come on!
-Shoot it!

359
00:50:49,384 --> 00:50:50,544
Take your shot!

360
00:50:53,922 --> 00:50:56,083
Not taking
any of that shit, man.

361
00:51:10,939 --> 00:51:14,466
-How did that Iast stuff go?
-Hell, man, I had it sold within a week.

362
00:51:14,643 --> 00:51:16,838
Needed more, but you changed
the phone numbers.

363
00:51:17,012 --> 00:51:20,641
-I had people begging for them 20s.
-Had to Iay Iow for a while.

364
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:22,283
That's what I heard.

365
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:24,646
Heard someone popped your mule
at the airport.

366
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,913
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

367
00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:31,583
He's up in Obispo, and I think he may
try to deal his way out.

368
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,491
-How much of a problem would that be?
-Ain't no big thing.

369
00:51:35,664 --> 00:51:37,564
But ain't nobody
gonna work for free.

370
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:40,327
-What would it take?
-It'II cost you 100 K in 20s...

371
00:51:40,502 --> 00:51:42,493
...if they're as good as the Iast ones.

372
00:51:42,671 --> 00:51:46,698
Fifty thousand in 100s. It's all I have
on hand at the moment.

373
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:50,777
Big bills ain't popular in this
neighborhood, brother. It's gotta be 20s.

374
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:54,613
Well, I might be able to find...

375
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:59,015
...50,000 or so in 20s
Iying around somewhere.

376
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:00,779
Can I ask you something?

377
00:52:00,956 --> 00:52:02,890
As Iong as you print that shit yourself...

378
00:52:03,058 --> 00:52:06,721
...what the hell do you care
if I make 25, 50 or 100 grand?

379
00:52:06,895 --> 00:52:09,420
It'd be nothing but motherfucking paper
to you.

380
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:13,200
AII right, I'II tell you what.

381
00:52:13,368 --> 00:52:18,533
I'II take 75 K in 20s, and I'II personally
guarantee the job.

382
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:32,650
You still driving that piece of shit?

383
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:07,651
-Hey, what shit they showing tonight?
-It's that galactical warrior movie.

384
00:53:07,823 --> 00:53:11,384
-I hate that space shit, man.
-It's nothing but science fiction, man.

385
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:21,567
Hey, what's going down, Reuben?

386
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:23,795
They're gonna move on somebody.

387
00:53:26,374 --> 00:53:28,968
-Yeah? Somebody getting whacked out?
-Yeah.

388
00:53:29,144 --> 00:53:31,408
Don't know who, huh?

389
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,007
Could be anybody.

390
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:36,446
Just keep an eye out.

391
00:53:36,985 --> 00:53:40,011
-Am I being hit, man?
-I don't know. It's someone over here.

392
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:51,292
-Cody!
-Son of a bitch.

393
00:53:51,466 --> 00:53:52,763
You're mine, motherfucker.

394
00:53:52,934 --> 00:53:55,402
-Come here, I got something for your ass.
-It's for you!

395
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,401
Come here! Get him!

396
00:53:57,572 --> 00:53:59,506
Shag his ass!

397
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:02,243
Hold it! Lay Iow!

398
00:54:04,412 --> 00:54:06,972
Get off me!

399
00:54:07,149 --> 00:54:08,446
Help me!

400
00:54:12,354 --> 00:54:15,323
-How you doing?
-Hello. Room three.

401
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,082
Thanks.

402
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,665
Pretty girl, Carl.

403
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:32,532
Actress?

404
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:39,705
-Stomach problems, huh?
-UIcer.

405
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:41,610
Remember me?

406
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:43,614
Football game at the airport?

407
00:54:43,785 --> 00:54:46,652
They want me to have an operation,
but I can't stand the thought...

408
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:49,381
...of one of those prison butchers
slicing me open.

409
00:54:49,558 --> 00:54:52,550
I'd rather drink this shit-pink cement.

410
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:54,718
I want to get Rick Masters.

411
00:54:54,896 --> 00:54:57,922
I've taken four falls. I never ratted
anybody in my Iife...

412
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:00,226
...and I've had plenty of chances,
believe me.

413
00:55:00,402 --> 00:55:02,893
Masters is your friend.
I don't blame you.

414
00:55:03,071 --> 00:55:06,507
I would never hang up a friend.
Anybody who would is a piece of shit.

415
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:12,739
The thing is, your friend
tried to have you iced.

416
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:15,974
That doesn't mean I'm gonna
roll over and play informer.

417
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,321
If you're Iooking for a pigeon,
go to the park.

418
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,621
Look, I'II tell you what.

419
00:55:26,795 --> 00:55:30,925
You help me, I'II get to a judge,
have your sentence reduced to a parole...

420
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:33,659
...get you the fuck out of here.

421
00:55:33,835 --> 00:55:35,928
What would I have to do?

422
00:55:36,805 --> 00:55:38,932
-Like, exactly.
-Simple.

423
00:55:39,107 --> 00:55:43,009
Show me where you print
and testify against him in open court.

424
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:49,617
I'd rather stay here the rest of my Iife
than testify in open court.

425
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:57,218
Then you better Iock your cell door
and throw away the key...

426
00:55:57,392 --> 00:55:59,594
...because I cannot take care
of you in here.

427
00:56:23,851 --> 00:56:25,819
I got all it takes, brother.

428
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:30,723
Hello, Jeff.

429
00:56:32,026 --> 00:56:33,721
What are you doing in my crib?

430
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:41,195
You sent two assholes to do Cody,
and they blew it.

431
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:44,167
I paid you half. I want it back.

432
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:45,896
Yeah, well...

433
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:49,099
...I'm trying to get
that money back myself.

434
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:52,939
I had to front the whole purchase
to get my people to do their thing...

435
00:56:53,114 --> 00:56:55,446
...so I ain't got any more.

436
00:56:55,616 --> 00:57:01,646
Well, then you better try and shit 40 grand,
because I ain't Ieaving without it.

437
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:04,886
I owe you, Cody.

438
00:57:05,192 --> 00:57:06,989
Next time, there'II be no fuckup.

439
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:08,958
What next time?

440
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,360
He's in protective custody.

441
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:13,757
Hell....

442
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:16,528
Protective custody
don't mean shit to me.

443
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:18,797
The man's dead.

444
00:57:23,978 --> 00:57:25,843
In a pig's ass.

445
00:57:28,883 --> 00:57:31,875
I want my paper, Jeff.

446
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:35,181
I can't afford to have it
circulating right now.

447
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,723
And I told you I don't have it.

448
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:44,194
Get it.

449
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:48,200
Now, Iook, my man...

450
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:53,396
...I told you I don't have
what you're Iooking for...

451
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:55,906
...so why don't you
make it easy on yourself...

452
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:59,078
...and just shag your ass
out of my crib.

453
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,143
Now, you be a printer.

454
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:04,750
Go get some ink...

455
00:58:04,919 --> 00:58:07,114
...and start printing
some more of that shit.

456
00:58:08,556 --> 00:58:10,615
What's happening, fella?

457
00:58:11,926 --> 00:58:13,154
Yeah, you, asshole!

458
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:24,200
What are you gonna do now,
motherfucker?

459
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:35,106
Goddamn it!

460
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:39,911
-Come on, motherfucker!
-Don't! Don't!

461
00:58:41,689 --> 00:58:44,317
You broke your contract with me,
Jeff.

462
00:58:44,492 --> 00:58:47,427
Now, I don't know
whether you're into it...

463
00:58:47,595 --> 00:58:52,259
...but you're gonna have to suck on this
until you give me back my paper.

464
00:59:05,346 --> 00:59:08,008
-How much are you gonna burn?
-AII of it.

465
00:59:08,182 --> 00:59:09,672
Why?

466
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:13,314
No good to me
after they handled it.
