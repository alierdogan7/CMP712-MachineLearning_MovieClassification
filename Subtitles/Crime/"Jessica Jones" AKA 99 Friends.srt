Yeah?

17
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,344
Audrey Eastman. I know I'm early.
I just want to get this over with.

18
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,013
You mentioned
your divorce lawyer referred you.

19
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,765
I'd love to thank him.
What was his name?

20
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,850
Desmond Tobey.

21
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,560
He's at Hogarth, Chao & Benowitz.

22
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,063
-I hope you're as good as he says you are.
-I am.

23
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,358
So is that sign just for show,
or do you actually have an office?

[keys clattering]

25
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,531
That man has been trying to get into
his apartment for, like, five minutes.

26
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,950
Nice building.

27
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,206
Hey.

28
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,707
You good?

29
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,961
You care?

30
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,213
Just don't wanna be another reason
for you to get high.

31
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,048
Don't need a reason.

32
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,303
Carlo thinks I'm an idiot.

33
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,555
But I can smell it on him

34
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,517
every time he sneaks into bed
at 3:00 in the morning.

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,102
Wouldn't be his first affair, either.

36
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,938
Some people can't
keep their lives in check.

37
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:54,735
They just go along blindly ruining
the lives of everyone in their path.

38
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,904
I'm sick of pretending
it doesn't matter.

39
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,246
How long have you been in business?

40
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,040
Why do you ask?

41
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,083
[scoffs] I want to know
that if I write you a check,

42
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,501
you'll stick around
long enough to earn it.

43
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,753
I'll earn it.

44
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,046
Sorry.

45
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,925
It's Carlo, I thought I'd gotten used to
his lies and his wandering penis.

46
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,804
My lawyer says that I need pictures
for the divorce.

47
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,764
Of Carlo and his...

48
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,974
-Mistress.
-Skank!

49
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,226
Nothing plays like pictures in court.

50
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,396
He'll ask for alimony.
I'm not giving him shit.

51
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,400
I need you to catch him in flagrante.
You know, in the act--

52
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,778
I know what in flagrante means.

53
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,740
Carlo says he's meeting a client
Friday night.

54
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:46,119
Of course, when I asked his assistant,
she knew nothing about it.

55
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:51,041
Follow him after work, I guarantee he will
go straight from the office to her.

56
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,336
The kind of pictures you're asking for...

57
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,504
they're hard to look at.

58
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,881
They're harder to forget.

59
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,591
That's what I pay my shrink for.

Look, I... I don't care if you have
to knock down his door to do it.

62
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,058
I want you to get those pictures.

63
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,394
In fact, I want him to know
that he is being photographed.

64
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,771
So that's it?

65
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,733
Follow your husband
and take sex pictures?

66
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:17,860
Isn't that enough?

67
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,362

Tobey, right.

70
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,910
He referred you to me himself?

71
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,204
Yes, I already told you that.

72
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,832
And you haven't had any conversations
with a British man?

73
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,958
Dark hair, well-dressed?

74
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,209

Kilgrave didn't send him back.

94
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,354
Then why is he trying
to break down my door?

95
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,397
He thinks he killed you.

00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,485

if I'd been attacked.

[Jessica] She's alive.
You've seen it.

The best thing you can do for her
is stay away.

No, I felt her dying in my hands.
She was dead.

Sufentanil.

It knocks people out.

135
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,272
This is what made you think
that you killed Trish.

136
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,986
You know, I've spent my whole life
protecting people.

137
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,655
You're still you.
You just need time to--

138
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,283
I did things in the line of duty,
horrible things,

139
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,745
but I have never wanted
to kill an innocent woman.

140
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,622
[scoffs] Do you want to kill her now?

141
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,832
-No. God, no.
-No, because you never did.

142
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,417
-Kilgrave wanted it.
-Kilgrave?

143
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,629
-And he made you want it.
-Well, how?

144
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,256
[sighs] It doesn't matter how.

145
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,467
He told you to jump, you jumped.
He's done with you.

146
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,387
Well, he also told me to kill Ms. Walker.
Is he done with her, too?

147
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,265
Look, just go home,
go to sleep, and move on.

148
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,475
What happens when he finds out
that she's still alive?

149
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,186
-I'll handle it.
-He'll send somebody else, won't he?

150
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,562
It won't end till we stop him.

151
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,108
It will end when I stop it.
You have no idea what's involved here.

152
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,859
Well, I know there's a guy
who controls minds,

153
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,695
and there's a woman
who flew out of the sky to save my life.

154
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,322
I may not have your abilities,

155
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:18,160
but I've got eight years Special Ops
and an entire police force to back me up.

156
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,245
No police. I will handle it.

157
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,622
You're not gonna make her feel safe,
Sergeant.

158
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,999
Go home.

159
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,002
I got her covered.

160
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,672
I think I know a way
to get her off Kilgrave's hit list.

161
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,965
[sighs] But it's gonna be painful.

Hi, I'm Trish Walker
and this is <i>Trish Talk.</i>

164
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,646
During my last broadcast,
I made some...

165
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:51,401
flippant and disrespectful comments
about a certain individual.

166
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,945
I was out of line by belittling this man,

167
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,616
and ignorant of my own limitations
in challenging him.

168
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,538
He is a very fascinating
and powerful man,

169
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,707
deserving of respect,
and to that end,

170
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,295
if he's listening, and I think he is...

171
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,172
I want to apologize.

172
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,425
I hope he forgives me.

173

[Trish shuddering]

174
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,181
I need a shower.

175
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,351
Saying the words doesn't make it true.

176
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,853
Remember acting?
It's how you won that award.

177
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,063
My mom blew half the jury
to get me that award.

178
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,857
It might not have been about my acting.

179
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,692
Fine, but Kilgrave knows
you're afraid of him,

180
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,569
and that's all he cares about.

181
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,696
Men and power,
it's seriously a disease.

182
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,115
I mean, superpowered man, but...

183
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,660
-Jess?
-[camera clicking]

184
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,585
Jess?

185
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,962
Jess, are you okay?

186
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,006
Yeah, I just thought I...

187
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,924
saw someone I knew.

188
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,719
Yeah, no Teen Choice Award for you.

189
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,803
Talk.

190
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,266
Kilgrave's been surveilling me.

191
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,600
Taking pictures.

192
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,310
-Why?
-I don't know.

193
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,980
So he can record me imploding
as he tortures me?

194
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,609
The spy could be anyone
or everyone.

195
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,611
It's been going on for weeks.
I had no idea.

196
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,946
Just breathe, okay?
[stammers]

197
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,114
He isn't here now.

198
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,367
Yeah, well, he's always here.

199
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,505
[Jessica] <i>I don't need</i>
<i>reminders of what I did to Luke.</i>

200
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,677
<i>Even if I had good intentions.</i>

201
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,054
<i>Mostly.</i>

202
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,070
Listen to me, Larry.
You are never gonna win this one.

203
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,198
[Larry] <i>Oh, are you a legislator now?</i>
<i>Are you gonna rewrite the patent law?</i>

204
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,701
I'm not going to have to.

205
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,495
Do you have any idea
how much people love their pets?

206
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:12,625
Your clients poisoned their pets,
abusing manufacturing loopholes in China.

207
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,586
You know who people hate
more than litigators?

208
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,421
Puppy killers.

209
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,797
<i>We can come in at half.</i>

210
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,424
She won't wait.
She wouldn't listen.

211
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,217
I couldn't hear you over that print.

212
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,386
Larry, let me call you back.

213
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,055
That was a potential
$50 million settlement.

214
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,974
-Now I have to ramp him back up.
-Oops!

215
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,435
I need to know if your firm
represents Audrey Eastman.

216
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,311
She says she's with Desmond Tobey.

217
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,356
Well, then you should be
invading Tobey's office.

218
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:38,067
I did. Are "attorney-client privilege"
the only words that he knows?

219
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,652
He wouldn't even tell me
if he referred her to me.

220
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,320
What's going on?
You're on edge.

221
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:45,074
The last people referred to me
wound up dead in my elevator.

222
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,951
If Audrey Eastman follows the same path,

223
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,661
she won't be able to pay her legal bills.

224
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,288
She is a client, I'll confirm that.

225
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,417
-And do you trust him? Tobey?
-He's a partner.

226
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,877
That's not an answer.

227
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,796
He's handling my own divorce,
so yes, I trust him.

228
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,964
Okay, good,
that's all I need to know.

229
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,298
You need to pull yourself together.

230
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,093
You are coming across
distinctly paranoid.

231
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,431
[Jessica] Everyone keeps saying that.
It's like a conspiracy.

232
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,517
[cell phone vibrating]

233
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,643
-[cell phone beeps]
-[Jessica] I'm working.

234
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:15,104
-[Trish] <i>What if the apology didn't work?</i>
-Then I'll deal with it.

235
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,690
Look, I'm with a client right now.
Sort of.

236
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,235
How can you trust any client after
what happened with Hope's parents?

237
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,321
[Jessica] I don't, which is why I've been
following her since dawn.

238
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,907
<i>Following who?</i>

239
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,785
[sighs] A jealous wife.

240
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,871
Jess, come on,
I need the distraction.

241
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,581
[Jessica] Fine.

242
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,207
A jewelry designer.

243
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,626
Audrey Eastman.

244
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,252
Overpriced, chunky enamel stuff?

245
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,338
Well, if she is mind-controlled,
that would explain some of her jewelry.

246
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,632
It's not like she needs the money.

247
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,509
Her parents died and left her a fortune,

248
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,760
but all she does is work.

249
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,888
Cheating husband...
She's compartmentalizing.

250
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,892
-[scoffs] Useful skill.
<i>-How will you know if she's Kilgraved?</i>

251
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,727
His effect has limits.

252
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,565
[Trish] <i>Right, time and distance.</i>

253
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,400
But you can't follow her forever.

254

<i>I've never seen his voodoo</i>

255
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,988
If he doesn't show soon, I'll...

256
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:10,660
do the job and take pictures of the
cheater with his pants around his ankles.

257
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,500
Nothing plays like pictures.

258

259
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,213

[Jessica] <i>You still wanna</i>

261

Yes.

262
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,678
It's a little illegal.

263
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,012
Answer's still yes.

264
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,223
Can you get me
police surveillance video?

265
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,476
<i>-Who you looking for?</i>
-Myself.

266
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,354
Kilgrave's got somebody tailing me,
feeding him pictures.

267
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,482
Police footage will show
who's around me.

268
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,942
Yeah, well, we have cameras
all over the city.

269
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,819
You got times, dates, locations?

270

Texting them to you now.

271
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,115
I got your six.

272

[scoffs] "Got my six."

[Pam] It's an hour north of Rome.

274
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:04,046
My sister said the views
from the hotel are amazing.

275
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,009
Unbelievable. Two more walk-ins
because of that goddamn radio interview.

276
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,802
Can I have my Jeri back, please?

277
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,305
I would love to have lunch
without us bringing the office with us.

278
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,017
[sighs] I'm sorry. I'm here.

279
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,143
And I promise you,

280
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,480
after this circus is over,
I will take you anywhere you want to go.

281
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,648
Okay.

282
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,359
[scoffs] Oh, come on.

283
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,195
Don't tell me you're bringing her here.

284
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,572
We have a reservation.

285
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,408
Wendy, you don't have exclusive rights
to every restaurant we've ever been to.

286
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,910
Just the one where you proposed.

287
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,748
You proposed to her here?
Jesus, Jeri.

288
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,500
Did you forget?

289
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,585
I didn't forget proposing, no.

290
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,671
Well, that's worse for you than for me

291
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,089

-Let's just go somewhere else.
-No!

293
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,637
If she orders you the tiramisu
and there is a diamond ring at the bottom,

294

you'll think nothing could ever
make you stop feeling happy.

Don't choke on it.

296
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,227
You think, if you break us up,

297
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,229
that I will crawl back to you?

298
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,398
Read my face.
Never gonna happen.

299
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,827

00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,384
Tell them. Go ahead.

344
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,929
Kilgrave made me do it.

345
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,305
He's our gardener.

346
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,349
He landed on Jones Beach.
I thought it was a meteor.

347
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,562
But then a man
came out of the waves...

348
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,732
He lived with me for two days.

349
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,654
He made me play my cello for him...

350
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,323
until I made a mistake.

351
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,991
[man] He didn't even talk, man.

352
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:28,745
He just, like, stared at me
with his freaky glowing eyes.

353
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,666
I was like, "This dude is making
me wanna jack this place."

354
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,335
I pulled out my gun...

355
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,005
I couldn't stop smiling.
He wouldn't let me.

356
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,008
He said, "You want me bad."

357
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,719
And then I did want him... bad.

358
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,348
And not just Lucy.
All the girls in the neighborhood.

359
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,809
When he speaks,
they spread their legs.

360
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,060
Evil man.

361
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,188
He gave me a purple staff

362
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,357
and made me slide it up my--

363
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,276
He had dreads.

364
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,361
Bald.

365
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,653
Dark hair.

366
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,489
He wore a white dress shirt...

367
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,782
-Intense eyes.
-...and a tie.

368
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,369
A red T-shirt...

369
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,536
I think.

370
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,915
He never wears a shirt.
He's hot.

371
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,752
I was waiting for the L train.

372
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:22,674
And he said, uh, "Nice jacket.
You wanna give it to me, right?"

373
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,594
And I said, "Yeah."

374
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,346
And...

375
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,975
like an asshole, I handed it over.

376
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:35,229
Now, I know it's not the same
as killing my parents, but...

377
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,857
it was Zegna.

378
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,069
-That limey cocksucker owes me five grand.
-Limey?

379
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,488
Yeah, he had an accent.
He's British.

380
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,240
-Get up.
-I'm telling the truth.

381
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,534
Get up.

382
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,794
[shuddering]

383
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,381
Put him on the list.

384
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,056
Talk amongst yourselves.
Exchange info.

385
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,140
Thanks.

386
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,894
-What was that about?
-We're starting a band.

387
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,148
I told them to keep in touch. Talk.

388
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,568
You starting a support group?
Will you be participating?

389
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,529
Like I'd waste my time circle jerking
with a bunch of whiners.

390
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,282
Yes, you are a paragon of mental health.

391
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,621
I'm using them, Hogarth.

392
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,792
I wanna know everything they did with him,
everywhere they went,

393
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:42,713
every word that was said,
particularly about me,

394
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,923
and what the hell he's gonna do next.

395
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,468
Kilgrave wanted a leather jacket,
live cello music,

396
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,511
and the flattering smile
of a pretty girl.

397
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,472
What a waste.

398
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,599
He could solve so many problems
with his gift.

399
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,891
Gift?

400
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,188
I just meant, if...
if he was on our side.

401
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,731
What side would that be?

402
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,192
The side that uses people?

403
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,568
Treats them like animals?

404
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,777
Jessica, do not take this out on me.

405
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,945
Just to throw them away
like garbage?

406
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,948
The side that rips your life apart
and destroys you from the inside out?

407
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,743
Whose side exactly would that be?

408
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,330
[sighs]

409
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,332
-[glass breaking]
-[all exclaim]

410
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,963

411
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,849
[whistling]

412
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,438
[Simpson] Hey.

413
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,024
Hey, I got your movie.

414
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,611
It's 30 hours.
Cast of thousands.

415
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,321
Thanks, I should've got some popcorn.

416
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:56,287
Listen, there's a lot to comb through,
but your spy is in there somewhere.

417
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,371
Hey!

418
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,206
What are you looking at, huh?

419
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,375
What the hell are you looking at, huh?

420
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,001
-Hey, get off him!
-He's watching!

421
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,795
Yeah, he's probably
watching the ceiling melt.

422
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,672
He doesn't like me.

423
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,757
Malcolm, go sleep it off.

424
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,181
Hey, I got enough to deal with

425
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,808
without worrying about you going all
search and destroy on me.

426
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,435
I know, I am...

427
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,147
I know how to turn it off, I...

428
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,649
The paranoia and the panic, I just--

429
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,151
Listen, there's this...

430
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,153
[sighs] group of people.

431
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,741
They've all been through
the same thing, so...

432
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,995
if you wanna talk or something,
they meet tomorrow night.

433
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,748
Yeah, I'm not into it, either.

434
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,293
I gotta go.

435
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,737
[sighs] God damn it.

436
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,366
[sighs deeply]

437
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:21,497
<i>Now I know how it feels,</i>
<i>someone watching your every move,</i>

438
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,790
<i>seeing you in private moments.</i>

439
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,839
Jessica.

440
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,219
Are you Jessica?

441
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:19,971
Yeah.

442
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,808
Where are your parents?

443
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,851
Patsy Walker is safe.

444
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,770
What did you say?

445
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:30,357
You don't have to worry about her,
for now.

446
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,195
-Who told you that?
-The man.

447
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,530
He said he liked her apology.

448
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,703
How old are you?

449
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,206
Eight and a half.

450
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,085
I'm sorry that this is happening to you.

451
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,545
You're a bitch.

452
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,088
You could have stopped that bus.

453
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:57,050
You left him there to die in the street,
like a goddamn dog.

454
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,262
-Stop it.
-You turn everything to shit.

455
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,347
Jesus!

456
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,848
It's Friday.

457
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,184
[stammering] What does that mean?

458
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,395
Don't you have a job to do?

459
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,857
Are you talking about Audrey?

460
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,693
Did Kilgrave send Audrey?

461
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,111
Did he send Audrey?

462
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,988
-Was he at her target practice? Wait!
-[screaming]

463
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,406
Mommy!
Where's Mommy?

464
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,199
It's okay.
I'm gonna help you find your mom.

465
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,826
-Chanise!
-Mommy!

466
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,078
-She won't let me go!
-Sorry! I'm sorry.

467
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,788
Are you okay?
Did she hurt you, baby?

468
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,665
She was lost.
I was just trying to help.

469
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,459
Stay away from her!

470
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,597
[intercom buzzing]

471
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,895
What are you doing here?

472
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,021
[Simpson stammering]

473
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,525
I'm sorry to show up like this.
I just wanted to make this right.

474
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,570
You can't.

475
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,572
I got something for you.

476
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,742
I don't want anything from you.

477
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:08,289
-Well, it might help. Please.
-[elevator dings]

478
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,125
Um...

479
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:15,671
It's personal.

480
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,384
I can't let you in.

481
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,847
Put it on the floor.

482
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,981
Now go to the end of the hall.

483
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,156
Uh, did you open it?

484
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,325
Yes.

485
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,622
I just want you to feel safe.

486
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,668
Is it legal?

487
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:39,421
No.

488
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,848
You still there?

-How?

I have a gun on her,
for Christ's sake, Carlo.

You shoot at me, I'll pull the bullet

-[Carlo] Jesus!
-Nope, not bulletproof.

521
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,706
Audrey, this is insane.
Honey, we don't have to do this.

522
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,957
We can walk out of here right now--

523
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,042
She doesn't have laser eyes either,
or she would have used them.

524
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,379
Laser eyes?
Who said I had laser eyes?

525
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,758
Oh, that dick with the Aston Martin.
I served him a subpoena.

526
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,595
Gregory Spheeris. I sell to his wife.
They're very talky.

527
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,680
Look, you're obviously
pissed off about something,

528
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,684
but I'm pretty sure, for the first time,
this has nothing to do with Kilgrave.

529
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,227
He's smarter than you two.

530
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,189
Kilgrave? Who's Kilgrave?
Is he another one of you people?

531
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,108
How many more are there like you?

532
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,235
How many more what, private eyes?

533
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,612
"Gifted."

534
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,072
Stupid word.

535
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:20,201
It's like calling someone "special."
They're not special, they're retarded.

536
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,495
You're not gifted,
you're a freak.

537
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,916
What have we or the mentally challenged
ever done to you?

538
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,794
You saved the city.

539
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,505
That's what the newspapers said.
You were "heroes."

540
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,841
Not me.

541
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,592
"The city was saved."

542
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:39,512
But I was there.
I saw what really happened.

543
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,264
I saw my mother crushed to death

544
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,391
under a building
that you people destroyed.

545
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,768
In the incident?

546
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,145
I was trying
to pull my mother out from the rubble,

547
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,064
watching her bleed to death,

548
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,608
[sniffles] while all around me,
you people were raining down hell.

549
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:55,445
So go after the big green guy
or the flag waver.

550
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,780
I wasn't even there!

551
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,991
Consider it a preventative measure
for next time. [sniffles]

552
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,162
[Jessica] You think you're the only ones
who've lost people?

553
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,122
You think you're the only ones with pain?

554
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,835
You think you can take your shit
and dump it on me?

555
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,628
You don't get to do that!

556
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,548
So you take your goddamn pain
and you live with it, assholes!

557
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,717
[Audrey screams]

558
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,346
You lost your parents?
Welcome to the goddamn club!

559
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,682
I lost mine in some random accident.

560
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:27,435
Do you see me trying to kill
every shitty driver? No!

561
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,063
Because I don't work my shit out
on other people!

562
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:34,109
So keep your goddamn feelings
to yourselves!

563
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,530
[panting]

564
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,492
Ninety-nine.

565
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,997
You wanted to know
how many of us there are?

566
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,249
The last time I counted,

567
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:54,629
I had 99 gifted friends
in this borough alone.

568
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,672
And now every single one of them

569
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:59,968
is gonna know about this shit
that you tried to pull.

570
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,596
And they hate attempted murder.

571
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,348
They really do.

572
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:10,270
The cops hate it, too, you know,
because it's against the law.

573
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,814
Please don't kill us. [stammering]
We're gonna leave you alone.

574
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,150
There's only one thing
that you can do to save yourselves.

575
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,028
-What?
-Disappear.

576
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:23,241
Nobody, especially me,
ever hears from you again.

577
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:28,997
Me and my friends will stop by tomorrow
to make sure you heard me.

578
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,462
I want a divorce.

579
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,673
-[glass shattering]
-[Audrey screams]

580
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,736
[clicks keyboard]

581
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,157
<i>I couldn't stop smiling.</i>
<i>He wouldn't let me.</i>

582
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,713
And this one guy

583
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:06,052
stitched a silhouette of my hair
in orange sequins.

584
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,180
And this girl sent me a stuffed, uh...

585
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,559
It kind of looked like a voodoo doll.

586
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,271
[Simpson] Of you?

587
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,232
Me or Carrot Top.
It wasn't clear. [chuckles]

588
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,777
[Simpson chuckles] It's creepy.

589
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,321
Well, it seemed normal at the time.

590
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:31,202
My mother had been
marketing the Patsy dolls for years, so...

591
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,372
Uh...

592
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,333
[chuckling] The whole thing's
a little embarrassing now.

593
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,173
I had G.I. Joes...

594
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,715
till they all burned.

595
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,053
Burned?

596
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,596
They went into battle
to save my sister's Barbie

597
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,349
and melted into one big clump.
[chuckles]

598
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,061
That's terrible.

599
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,854
Hey! They accomplished their mission.

600
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:02,608
-By dying?
-They rescued Barbie.

601
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:06,487
I mean, the Dream House was gutted,
but she had insurance.

602
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,199
You used actual fire?

603
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,326
You torched a Dream House?

604
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,245
-I was committed to the scenario.
-[both chuckle]

605
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,081
-[Simpson] Yeah.
-Mmm.

606
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,503
That was meant to be a story about how
I've always been the guy saving people.

607
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,423
Albeit plastic people and they melted.

608
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,759
Well, I just need you to know that.

609
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,179
The guy who tried to kill you...

610
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,183
it wasn't me.

611
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,482
I don't blame you.

612
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,568
Well, you're doing better than me.
[sighs]

613
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,404
I tried to fight it.

614
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,780
I couldn't.

615
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,867
Hey, listen.

616
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,996
What Kilgrave did to you,
he did to Jessica.

617
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,416
It doesn't matter how strong you are.

618
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,839
Maybe not,
but we can protect ourselves.

619
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,598
Trish?

620
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,106
I might shoot you by accident.

621
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,900
It's worth the risk.

622
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,418
[inaudible]

623
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,288
-You went back to work?
-I had to.

624
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,875
-I needed things to feel normal again.
-Yeah, so did I.

625
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,502
Ah, you're a New York City cop.

626
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:31,132
I'm sure your "normal"
is pretty crazy to begin with.

627
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,718
Unlike being an actress.

628
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,636
Completely sane profession. [laughs]

629
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,638
Yeah. [chuckles]

630
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,682
[cell phone vibrating]

631
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,520
Hogarth.

632
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,107
<i>I sent more potential victims</i>
<i>to your survivor's group.</i>

633
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,733
It's not my survivor's group.

634
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,195
<i>Maybe it should be.</i>
<i>You need to process your trauma.</i>

635
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,321
[sighs] I'm sorry, who is this?

636
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:57,617
<i>Fine. You need to not take</i>
<i>your crap out on my glass walls.</i>

637
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,701
Put it on my tab.

638
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,329
<i>When are you planning to pay that off?</i>

639
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,290
Not tonight, Hogarth.
Not tonight.

640
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:11,131
Avery was crying because I forgot
to put his action figures in the car.

641
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:15,760
He'd been fussy all morning,
and in the car, he was just impossible.

642
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,678
I lost my temper.

643
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,847
Then we hit a red light
just south of Herald Square,

644
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,601
and Kilgrave just opened the door
and got in.

645
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,230
Said he liked my car,
wanted to ride around.

646
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,235
Avery was still crying,

647
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,737
but Kilgrave never once looked at him.

648
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,490
He just stared straight ahead and said...

649
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:42,036
"You'd like to leave your son,
wouldn't you?"

650
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,330
And I said yes.

651
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:48,376
I pulled Avery out, put him on the curb,
and drove away.

652
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:54,215
I saw him in my rear-view mirror,
just weeping on the sidewalk,

653
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,760
and I hated myself because...
it's what I wanted.

654
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,808
I disappeared for a week
while I was Kilgrave's chauffeur.

655
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,604
I was charged with child abandonment.

656
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:12,192
My wife left me, which [scoffs]
I don't blame her, because--

657
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,569
You drove him for a week?

658
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,321
24/7?

659
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,573
Yeah, it was a nightmare.
I was haunted by--

660
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,824
Where did you drive him?

661
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,743
-I'm not sure that's the--
-Did he meet anyone in particular?

662
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,579
Did anyone deliver pictures to him?

663
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,247
-Um, actually, yeah.
-Who?

664
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,750
I don't know, I just had to drive Kilgrave
to meet the same guy

665
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,377
every day at 10:00 a.m. on the dot.

666
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,087
-He was very punctual.
-What did he look like?

667
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,173
Is this some kind of
reenactment therapy?

668
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,800
Screw therapy.
What did he look like, the guy he met?

669
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,136
Well, [scoffs] I never got close,
and it was freezing.

670
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,806
Everyone's wrapped
in tons of layers and hats.

671
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,058
He wore a scarf.

672
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,685
Blue and white stripes.

673
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,958
[lock breaking]

674
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,813
[dramatic music playing]
