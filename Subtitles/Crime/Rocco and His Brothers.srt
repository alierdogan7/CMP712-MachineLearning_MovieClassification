1
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,496
Wake up, come on.
We're in Milan

2
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:42,538
Get up, Luca, we're here.

3
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:45,978
At last!

4
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:50,691
Come on, Mamma.

5
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:54,099
Are you tired?

6
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:05,420
Rocco, the basket.

7
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,618
Ma, got everything?

8
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:24,302
- You tired? - You're
sure you have everything?

9
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:27,057
- Where's Vincenzo?
- l don't know.

10
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:29,777
- Why isn't he here yet?
- Maybe he's outside.

11
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,777
Why isn't Vincenzo here?

12
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:37,213
- Why isn't Vincenzo here?
- l can't see, you look.

13
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,054
Here!

14
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:42,501
Ma, want me to look for him?

15
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:44,540
- Don't get lost.
- Sure!

16
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:01,662
There's nobody here.

17
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:46,059
How beautiful!

18
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,181
- Ciro, look how nice!
- Big, isn't it?

19
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,540
What a city!

20
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,737
Rocco, look at those
shops, the lights.

21
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,342
lt's like daylight.

22
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:09,972
Listen!

23
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:15,892
What stop is near
this address?

24
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:18,657
- Last stop.
- Last stop?

25
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:21,582
Last stop, end of the line.
At Lambrate.

26
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:23,938
- What then?
- Get off at Lambrate.

27
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,695
- My son.
- Your son?

28
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:29,894
- The oldest...
- Oh, the oldest.

29
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,259
We're going to see him.

30
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:37,335
Let's toast the fiancés!

31
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,141
Best wishes! All the best!

32
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:45,894
One always ends up drinking
too much at these parties.

33
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:49,892
Here we are!

34
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:52,332
Thank you, thanks.

35
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:55,534
They decided on their own.

36
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:58,458
Parents don't count anymore.

37
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:02,452
We had to start sometime.

38
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:07,613
Besides, l don't feel
like going back down there.

39
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:11,740
l want to raise my family up here.

40
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:15,177
Why don't you get married too?

41
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:18,335
Me? Only my sister's that dumb.

42
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:27,103
He's worried about supporting us.

43
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,652
But we'll manage on our own.

44
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,542
- That's right.
- Right, Vincenzo?

45
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:35,980
Thanks.

46
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,811
- We're not looking for anything.
- Oh, Lord! Please...

47
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:48,618
This is Aldo.

48
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:51,096
l'm going to the movies.

49
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:54,659
- Have fun!
- Bye!

50
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:58,739
- Bye, Ma.
- Bye. Have fun.

51
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:01,742
Thank you.

52
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,861
Always the movies!
He lives on bread and movies.

53
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:06,940
lt's a fixation with him!

54
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:09,458
Sunday l went along too..

55
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:11,375
..and immediately fell asleep.

56
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:16,981
Hello.
Do the Giannellis live here?

57
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,979
l'm Mrs. Parondi.

58
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:22,334
Vincenzo,
come and see who's here.

59
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:25,176
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.

60
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:28,378
Mamma!

61
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:32,534
Oh, my son.

62
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:37,779
Luca, how are you?

63
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,972
Rosaria, dear Rosaria.

64
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:49,851
Your family?
Oh, God bless you!

65
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,102
This is Rosaria, everybody.

66
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:55,695
They're your brothers?

67
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,020
- This is Luca.
- Hello.

68
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:00,379
Simone. She's my fiancé.

69
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:02,659
- Good.
- Rocco..

70
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:04,302
..and Ciro.
- Hello.

71
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,533
Leave everything here
and come inside.

72
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,733
Come on.

73
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:10,854
Come inside.

74
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,495
lt's her, Vincenzo's mother!

75
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:18,658
What a long trip.
Offer her some wine.

76
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:20,980
Come on, boys!

77
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:27,611
Offer them some wine,
they must be freezing.

78
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:30,855
Handsome boys, huh?
The picture of their mother.

79
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:33,731
Ginetta, pass the cookies around.

80
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:36,736
Really handsome boys.
Tired, huh?

81
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:39,659
lt's true, they're very similar.

82
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:43,500
They're dead tired.
Such a long trip!

83
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:47,576
- What a nice surprise!
- What's in there?

84
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:52,099
What misfortune
came upon us, my dear son!

85
00:08:58,423 --> 00:08:59,299
What is this?

86
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:02,018
Don't you wear mourning
for your father?

87
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,093
No,..

88
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:04,378
..it's just that...

89
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:08,980
She's Ginetta. l wrote you
about our engagement.

90
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:12,852
You arrived
just in time to bless us.

91
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:13,978
Marriage?

92
00:09:14,663 --> 00:09:18,099
You're so rich that you
can marry? Especially now..

93
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:20,857
..with your whole family
depending on you?

94
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:24,053
lf only you'd written..

95
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
..and let me know!
- We did write!

96
00:09:27,503 --> 00:09:30,540
Yes, but that was
when Papa died.

97
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:35,899
l answered: ''First l have
to find them a job''.

98
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:39,140
lt's not that easy here in Milan.

99
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:41,982
- Have a seat.
- Make yourselves comfortable.

100
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,452
- Tell us about yourselves.
- Let's hear.

101
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,538
Make yourself at home.

102
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:50,941
- He's shy.
- Probably tired.

103
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:54,251
- Not really.
- No? Naturally, he's young.

104
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,220
Were you cold?

105
00:09:56,623 --> 00:09:58,261
- No.
- Some candy?

106
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:03,015
And what have you got there?

107
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:03,854
Oranges.

108
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:07,101
Amelia!
Oranges from our hometown.

109
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:09,174
- Would you like one?
- Thank you.

110
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:13,134
Just smell!

111
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:15,813
Thank you.

112
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:20,694
Listen, Rosaria, l thought
you came for their engagement.

113
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:25,732
And that Vincenzo said nothing
because he wanted to surprise us.

114
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:30,620
My heart's too heavy
to think about parties.

115
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:34,253
And now what?
You came here straight..

116
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:35,822
..from the station?
- Yes.

117
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,175
So where
are you gonna sleep tonight?

118
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,896
My son won't leave us
in the street.

119
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:47,613
He'll take care of us.

120
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:51,495
Listen here, Rosaria.

121
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:55,618
l can understand your being
worried about your boys,..

122
00:10:56,143 --> 00:10:59,021
..but what about my girl, huh?!

123
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,973
She arrives just like that,
and ruins everything!

124
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:07,737
- Mamma, what are you saying?
- Mamma's right.

125
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,371
- You don't understand.
- l'm nobody's fool.

126
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,295
- There's no need to shout!
- Mamma's right!

127
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,341
Let's get out of this house!
Rocco! Simone!

128
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:18,222
- Mamma, no!
- You're all crazy!

129
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:22,615
- Come to your mother. - l'm not
crazy. l've understood, all right.

130
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:26,492
They want to keep you
from helping your mother.

131
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:30,338
They've no respect
for your dead father! Heathens!

132
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:32,182
How dare you!

133
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:35,461
- Let's get out!
- No, no.

134
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:38,376
Quiet, you, you're one of them!

135
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:41,132
Let's, boys, hurry up!

136
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:46,655
God will punish you,
for He judges everyone.

137
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:49,621
No, wait. They didn't mean
to offend you.

138
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,695
- Move it.
- Leave me, leave me!

139
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:55,616
- You keep quiet, jerk!
- Think l'm afraid, do you?

140
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:58,453
Leave my house!

141
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:02,060
Hear that? What are you
waiting for? Come on!

142
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,732
Get out!

143
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:13,338
Armando!

144
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:19,860
- Armando!
- Who is it?

145
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:24,613
lt's Vincenzo.
Let me in.

146
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:30,059
What's wrong?
How come so late?

147
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:31,622
l'll explain later.

148
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:34,213
Hurry up! lt's cold!

149
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:41,980
So why are you here
at this hour?

150
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:45,021
To sleep, if possible.

151
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,657
lt's almost day already.

152
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:50,621
Let's hear, boy,
what've you done?

153
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:52,694
l can explain everything.

154
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:54,782
Down!

155
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:59,461
Come on in.
You're afraid of the dogs?

156
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:03,293
Here there's wood, a stove,
all the comforts!

157
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:07,542
So explain.

158
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:12,376
My whole family arrived
unexpectedly, like an earthquake..

159
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:15,942
..And then argued
with my future in-laws.

160
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:21,261
l had to give up my room,
my fiancé and everything.

161
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,462
For you, a room and a fiancé
are the same thing?

162
00:13:27,343 --> 00:13:29,618
- lt's no joke.
- No.

163
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:32,053
How can l support
my whole family?

164
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:35,056
Where'll they stay?

165
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:37,100
l managed something for tonight,..

166
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:39,902
..but tomorrow?
Good God!

167
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:45,456
What's the problem?
Milan's full of empty houses.

168
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:49,492
Apartment buildings are
shooting up like mushrooms.

169
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:51,292
What about the rent?

170
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:55,653
Listen to me, do what all
you Southerners do.

171
00:13:55,823 --> 00:13:58,018
- Know what l mean?
- Not exactly.

172
00:13:58,183 --> 00:14:01,380
You rent a public housing
apartment and..

173
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:03,613
..if you can, you pay.

174
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:06,092
but after a few months
you stop paying.

175
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,094
- How is that?
- Wait!

176
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:10,902
A month later they evict you.

177
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,895
- How can l....
- Wait!

178
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,413
Then you join
the other evictees where you pay..

179
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:19,496
..almost nothing and there's
central heating, electricity, etc.

180
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:23,981
Milan's City Hall
leaves no one on the street.

181
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,174
Couldn't we go straight there?

182
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:28,977
No, you have to be evicted.

183
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:32,057
- Ah, right! - That's
the secret, understand?

184
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:35,574
- Good evening.
- Don't be such a knucklehead!

185
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:51,012
Porter!

186
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:54,537
Porter!

187
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:56,058
Huh?

188
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:58,971
l'm Mrs. Parondi, open up!

189
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:03,296
l'm coming! Hold on!

190
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:08,179
- What's the big rush?!
- ls this the place?

191
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:11,176
- There.
- l'm Rosaria Parondi.

192
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,619
Yes, Parondi, it's over there.

193
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:17,178
Downstairs, lower level.

194
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:19,176
Get a load of them.

195
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:37,341
Good morning, Signora Maria.

196
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,495
Did you see those dreadful people?
Zulus!

197
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:43,018
- Where are they from?
- Lucania.

198
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:45,538
Lucania? Odd name! Where's that?
Never heard of it.

199
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,421
Down South.

200
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,814
Ahh!
The land of do-nothings!

201
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:37,021
Wake up!

202
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,493
Ciro.

203
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,096
lt's snowing.

204
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:43,096
Rocco!
There's work for everybody.

205
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,658
Simone! lt's snowing.

206
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:50,135
What happened?

207
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,379
Nothing.
Today there's work for us.

208
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,459
The snow.

209
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,815
lt's sticking to the ground!

210
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:59,015
Luca, look, it's snowing.

211
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,254
- The snow!
- Get up.

212
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:04,301
Move along or we'll be too late.

213
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:08,575
The Milanese don't like
their streets with snow.

214
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:11,421
Hey, sleepyhead, get up!

215
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,973
Look at the snow!

216
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:21,573
Simone, darling, get up.

217
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:23,939
lt's snowing!
How wonderful!

218
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:26,458
There should be work
for everybody.

219
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:30,582
Look, the others are almost ready!

220
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:33,656
Get up, get up!

221
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,336
- Get a move on, Rocco.
- We're coming.

222
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:38,618
Simone!

223
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:44,139
Rocco, you've been sick.

224
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,581
- Wear one of my sweaters.
- But it's a woman's.

225
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:53,699
Let them tease away. Listen
to your mother. Put it on.

226
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:56,139
l'll get some breakfast.

227
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:58,772
Simone!

228
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:01,659
Come on, Simone,
we're working today.

229
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,217
- Luca! - Luca,
you'll make us late. Quit it!

230
00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:10,218
- Careful not to fall.
- Off you go!

231
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:14,494
- Hurry, boys!
- Move it, Ciro! Simone!

232
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:18,178
- The coffee's almost ready.
- Here l am.

233
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:22,661
Drink the eggs,
they're fresh and healthy!

234
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:29,054
The coffee's boiling hot.
Put in lots of bread.

235
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,173
Fix some for your brother too.

236
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:38,660
Oh, thank God,
there's work here for everybody!

237
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:42,060
The Lord is merciful.
He sent us the snow.

238
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:44,413
- You wearing my sweater?
- Yes.

239
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:51,097
Simone, dear, hurry. Come on!

240
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,812
- Poor baby, he has to go to work.
- lt's freezing. You even left..

241
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:58,982
..the window open.
l don't get hot flashes.

242
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:11,819
Come on, the city's waiting
for us, lazybones!

243
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,975
That guy will never change.
Finish your coffee.

244
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:19,454
l'll get lunch ready.
Luca, my satchel!

245
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:22,178
- Yes, Mamma.
- No, l'll get it.

246
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:28,693
- Luca, my satchel!
- lt's here, under the bed.

247
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:35,302
- l'll get it for you.
- Hurry up!

248
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:41,812
Here are your coats.

249
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:44,571
Rocco, cover up.
Don't take chances,..

250
00:19:44,743 --> 00:19:46,938
..you've been sick.
lf you had a chill...

251
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,981
Here, everything's ready.
Come on, hurry!

252
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:55,383
Hey, lazybones,
l'll help you with your coat.

253
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:58,820
Cover up, you loafer, you.

254
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:05,494
God bless this city!
You happy now?!

255
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:07,739
Rocco, my angel.

256
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:12,502
- This coffee's boiling hot.
- Come on, Ciro.

257
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:14,654
Hurry! lt's stopped snowing.

258
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:17,576
There's enough for a day's work.

259
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:21,858
Don't forget your hats.
Hurry it up!

260
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:25,060
Dear God, you can't be late!

261
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:28,974
Hurry, Mamma's kicking us out.

262
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:31,338
- Be quick!
- Coming, Mamma.

263
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:34,336
Move, l'm freezing here.

264
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,735
- Give me a kiss.
- Ciao.

265
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:40,617
Ciao, Rocco, God be with you.

266
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:44,300
You be careful, Ciro.

267
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,699
Go on, Vincenzo!
Good work!

268
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:50,937
By all the Saints, if you
don't come back with money..

269
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,061
..you're no longer sons
of Rosaria Parondi!

270
00:20:54,263 --> 00:20:56,652
- Ciao, Mamma.
- Good luck!

271
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:04,133
- Simone!
- Yes?

272
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:06,453
- Are you coming too?
- Where?

273
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:09,581
- To the delegation.
- Where's that?

274
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:11,182
l don't know.

275
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,978
Simone, Rocco, hurry!

276
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:54,100
- Ciao.
- You see him?

277
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:56,538
- He's gone now.
- How are you?

278
00:21:57,063 --> 00:22:00,021
- You haven't been around.
- l can explain everything.

279
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:01,821
- Ciao, Ginetta.
- Ciao.

280
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:04,543
Let's go where we can talk.

281
00:22:17,623 --> 00:22:19,853
l can't come to your house anymore..

282
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:23,135
..and you're always chaperoned....

283
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,016
Our families are against us.

284
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:28,492
- What chance do we have?
- l keep hoping.

285
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:31,575
- You're a born optimist.
- Ciao, Ginetta.

286
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:33,461
- Ciao.
- We'll manage.

287
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:37,059
We've got a place now.
And Mamma says one must take....

288
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:39,811
- Ciao!
..a woman without asking,..

289
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,498
..anyone's permission.
- One what?!

290
00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:46,572
What's wrong?

291
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:50,858
One takes her, like one
takes a woman, without asking.

292
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:56,379
With me you have to ask
every time!

293
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:59,501
- l'll ask.
- Ciao.

294
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:09,582
You whore!
Miserable bitch!

295
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:11,500
Shut up! l'm going!

296
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:24,662
- What's going on?
- Quiet!

297
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:32,458
lt's my father.
We don't get along.

298
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:36,294
Who are you?
You live here?

299
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:40,058
Wish l could,
but they don't want me. Hear that?

300
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:41,582
Why not?

301
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:45,212
Oh, the same old stupid story:

302
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:49,771
..you know, a girl's honor, etc.

303
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:53,817
They think it's important.
What's a poor girl to do?

304
00:23:57,023 --> 00:24:03,292
Can you imagine if all girls like me
suddenly disappeared? Just think....

305
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:08,100
Yeah....
There'd only be us men left.

306
00:24:09,023 --> 00:24:11,093
- To do what?
- Quiet!

307
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:17,103
- Hear that?
- What'll you do?

308
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,375
Go away. What else?

309
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:21,613
Wait.

310
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,935
Come inside.
Maybe my mother..

311
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:28,498
..has something warm
for you to wear..

312
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,253
You're sweet.

313
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:35,976
l'm what?

314
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:37,612
You're sweet.

315
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,297
Let's go.

316
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:49,661
- How far?
- Right there.

317
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:55,498
Come in.

318
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:59,182
- That's you, Vincenzo?
- Yes, Ma.

319
00:24:59,343 --> 00:25:01,777
Were they shouting at you?

320
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,336
No, not me,..

321
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:07,699
..at this poor girl here
who's got a problem.

322
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:12,657
Do you have something
she can cover up with?

323
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:16,179
- A girl?
- Yes, Ma.

324
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:21,093
- Where is she?
- Here, look.

325
00:25:22,743 --> 00:25:26,338
- Sorry, if l'm disturbing you.
- Close the door, it's freezing.

326
00:25:29,423 --> 00:25:33,052
Come in. l don't know
what l can give her.

327
00:25:33,303 --> 00:25:35,578
There's your father's old coat.

328
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:38,422
Whatever, but hurry,
she's shivering.

329
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,142
Let's see.

330
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:43,498
Evening.

331
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:45,099
Good evening.

332
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:48,173
Good evening.

333
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:52,577
Your brothers, huh?

334
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,736
Yes, we're all brothers.

335
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:05,775
lt's much colder down here.

336
00:26:08,703 --> 00:26:09,658
You're Milanese?

337
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:14,136
Nearby. From Cremona,
to be exact,..

338
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:16,258
..like the pickled fruit!

339
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,900
Southerners, huh?

340
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:28,418
You work here?

341
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,261
Today we shoveled snow.

342
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:32,418
Good for you!

343
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:36,942
He brought us.
We've been here a month.

344
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,981
Work's hard to find.

345
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:44,295
That's why we shoveled snow
today. Sit down.

346
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:50,132
Big boys like you find work
immediately, if that's..

347
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:51,816
..what you want.

348
00:26:52,663 --> 00:26:54,016
Your family?

349
00:26:54,303 --> 00:26:56,339
Yeah, l'm in the middle.

350
00:26:56,543 --> 00:26:59,341
So you're in the middle.
And that's you?

351
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:02,375
- This one is....
- He's Rocco.

352
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:04,773
- Which one is Rocco?
- lt's him. - Yes, it's him.

353
00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:07,655
And that's the other one.

354
00:27:07,863 --> 00:27:09,979
And who's the boxer here?

355
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:13,897
Vincenzo.

356
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:15,980
Who's Vincenzo?

357
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:19,622
But he's got no feel for it.

358
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:20,613
Why not?

359
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:23,898
lt's a shame. l know a champion.

360
00:27:25,223 --> 00:27:27,612
He was just a nobody.

361
00:27:27,783 --> 00:27:31,093
And now he's rich,
made piles of money!

362
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:37,100
l swear he drives a car
as long as a bus.

363
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:40,622
Better than shoveling snow!

364
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:43,417
You see!

365
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,212
He's against our trying out.

366
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:51,416
- What's there to lose?
- No?

367
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:53,093
You're right.

368
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:57,581
lf you're so convinced,
then do it!

369
00:27:57,863 --> 00:28:01,219
You don't need his permission.
You heard what she said.

370
00:28:01,543 --> 00:28:04,774
Baloney! My great career's
already come to an end.

371
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:09,495
lf you're lucky,
they pay your lunch.

372
00:28:09,863 --> 00:28:11,899
Because you're not a champ.

373
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:14,338
You don't become one overnight.

374
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:17,654
Maybe Simone and Rocco just might.

375
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:20,019
They're stronger than you.

376
00:28:20,183 --> 00:28:23,095
They'll still end up
with cauliflower ears.

377
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:27,018
The guy capable of knocking
Simone out hasn't even been born yet.

378
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:29,777
Mamma's right, Simone's stronger.

379
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:32,935
l almost forgot,
here, put this on.

380
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:35,339
l couldn't find anything better.

381
00:28:39,703 --> 00:28:40,931
Thank you.

382
00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:43,181
l'll bring it back tomorrow.

383
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:46,133
Wait, it's my friend,..

384
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:48,373
..the Sergeant who lives
in this building.

385
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:50,215
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

386
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:52,453
- Could you accompany her?
- Yes.

387
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:54,898
She had a bad fight
with her father.

388
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:58,100
- You can change in the bathroom.
- Thanks.

389
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:02,894
She's all we needed!

390
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:05,977
Come here,
and close that door!

391
00:29:09,303 --> 00:29:11,817
What's got into you?
Bringing her here!

392
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:14,742
You know her?
She could even be a whore.

393
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:16,939
- She's beautiful.
- Beautiful?

394
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:19,694
She had goose pimples,
the weakling.

395
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:22,697
Learn how to look at women.

396
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,219
She had goose pimples
because she was cold.

397
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:29,659
No, she's anaemic,
she's got Northern skin.

398
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:39,052
She's gone.

399
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:42,335
And my coat?

400
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:45,538
She went out the window.

401
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:48,179
Gone? Run off?
A thief!

402
00:29:50,183 --> 00:29:51,332
Her dress.

403
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:52,699
You're kidding...

404
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,620
l'm sorry,
l bothered you for nothing.

405
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:00,775
That's all right,
don't worry about it.

406
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:03,258
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

407
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:06,375
Disappointed?

408
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:08,302
l don't care.

409
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:11,621
You worry about yourself.
And clean those lentils.

410
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,379
You see, Ginetta is not
the only girl in the world.

411
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:20,975
Time to eat, boys.
The soup's ready. Come on!

412
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:28,219
Rocco, come and eat.

413
00:30:49,023 --> 00:30:57,180
#Maria Donata,
what beautiful flower is this!#.

414
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:02,412
#Let me give it a kiss.#

415
00:31:02,663 --> 00:31:06,451
#Oh, it's your mouth,
your nose.#

416
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:12,971
#My love's a rose, a rose.#

417
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:14,814
Turn round.

418
00:31:16,223 --> 00:31:16,655
Your right!

419
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:19,460
Hold it!

420
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:21,900
Lift that right!

421
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:28,136
- Merli, hold on, l'll come back.
- What's going on?

422
00:31:35,463 --> 00:31:37,772
- What are you doing here?
- Just looking.

423
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:43,176
Sorry, they're my brothers.
lt wasn't my idea.

424
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:45,653
Colli, have them change!

425
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:49,498
Parondi,
get your ass back here.

426
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:54,371
You heard him?
Move it!

427
00:31:55,423 --> 00:31:57,698
Well?
What are you doing?

428
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:00,621
Need an invitation?

429
00:32:04,143 --> 00:32:06,737
- Wait a minute, you.
- You calling me?

430
00:32:06,903 --> 00:32:09,656
Yeah, you with that cigarette.

431
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:12,579
Put some trunks on.
Hurry it up!

432
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:20,460
These hicks...
They wanna box and smoke too.

433
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,217
Get changed.

434
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:32,615
- Where are you from?
- Lucania.

435
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:34,978
- Where's that?
- Oh, it's a long way from here.

436
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:38,541
- You came up here to box?
- Why not?

437
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:41,058
- lt's tough!
- We can try.

438
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,742
Quiet!

439
00:32:58,583 --> 00:32:59,652
Vincenzo!

440
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:05,058
Vincenzo!

441
00:33:17,423 --> 00:33:18,776
Vincenzo!

442
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:36,338
- Vincenzo, where are you?
- l'm up here.

443
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:41,299
- They've come to evict us!
- At last!

444
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,901
Ma doesn't know what to do.
You coming?

445
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:46,138
l can't.

446
00:33:47,023 --> 00:33:50,299
Tell Mamma the City Hall
will give us a place now.

447
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:56,742
She needn't worry.
Do like l said, go on!

448
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,936
Jab, again!

449
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:02,902
Jab! Again!
Jab! Jab! Jab!

450
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:06,215
Where you going? Come here!

451
00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:10,383
Jab! Jab!

452
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:14,500
Come here! Jab! Jab!

453
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:20,259
Jab! Jab!

454
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,013
Ciao, Duilio, how's it going?

455
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:39,536
Fine, fine. He's new?

456
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:42,417
3 months.
He's slow, but solid.

457
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:45,497
- Go take your shower.
- Okay.

458
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:49,774
Hey!

459
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:58,459
Not bad.

460
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:04,653
Good horse teeth, but stained.

461
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:08,380
Cut out the cigarettes,
if you wanna box.

462
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:11,853
No offense, but if he stays
here, he'll get nowhere.

463
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,222
Got a minute?

464
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:24,733
Don't start taking
my best recruits now.

465
00:35:29,623 --> 00:35:32,820
You'll see,
you'll be going with him.

466
00:35:32,983 --> 00:35:35,338
''Cerri's Gym'',
where the champs work out.

467
00:35:38,183 --> 00:35:42,017
Let's hope they release me.
But if they don't,..

468
00:35:43,063 --> 00:35:44,496
..l'll go anyway.

469
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:50,493
They think l got the goods.

470
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,578
They never wanted Vincenzo.

471
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:56,697
What about you?

472
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:59,821
l guess
l don't have the goods.

473
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:04,536
Wait up,
l'm gonna shower too.

474
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:53,659
Age?

475
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:55,854
Twenty one.

476
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:58,012
Military service?

477
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:02,342
l'm 4-F,
because of an accident.

478
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:05,939
We'll get round that.
You willing to work?

479
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:07,772
To work?

480
00:37:08,383 --> 00:37:10,180
ln a gym. To get..

481
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:12,702
..into shape.

482
00:37:14,783 --> 00:37:18,253
We're forming a stable
of newcomers.

483
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,533
You're not that young,..

484
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:24,213
..but we'll see.

485
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,222
Coke!
Beer! ''Chinotto''!

486
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:37,817
Throw him out!

487
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:39,814
Go! Scram!

488
00:37:41,143 --> 00:37:44,738
A light heavyweight
three-round match. Between..

489
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:49,179
..Parondi, representing Milan,..

490
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:51,694
..sponsored by the Aurora Club....

491
00:37:57,423 --> 00:37:59,698
- l'm leaving!
- Sit down!

492
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:03,737
- Let me go!
- Parondi, traitor!

493
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:06,901
- They're razzing me.
- Just worry about Simone.

494
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:09,020
They're Ginetta's brothers.

495
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:14,782
....and Vitolo,
representing Virtus Club, Lucania.

496
00:38:15,183 --> 00:38:17,697
Go, Vitolo,
teach him a lesson!

497
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:18,818
Quiet.

498
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,573
The Parondis are all traitors!

499
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:24,701
Ferri, from Genoa.

500
00:38:31,063 --> 00:38:33,452
Seconds out.

501
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:42,053
First Round.

502
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,581
Parondi!
Parondi!

503
00:39:21,703 --> 00:39:23,978
Go, Simone, go!

504
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,573
- Bluff!
- Cut it out!

505
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:40,778
Phoney!

506
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:09,615
By a knockout..

507
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:14,812
..in the first round,
the winner is Simone Parondi.

508
00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:25,977
May l?

509
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:29,858
Hello, everybody!

510
00:40:30,783 --> 00:40:33,138
Good, very good!
What's this?

511
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:37,137
Nothing.
Anyway... he didn't go the limit.

512
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:42,178
lsn't he modest? ''Didn't go the limit''!
You're a champ!

513
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:49,340
Purple, the color
of champions and showgirls.

514
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,381
l'll train him myself.
l know what he needs.

515
00:40:57,143 --> 00:40:59,862
We'll eat out tonight
to celebrate.

516
00:41:00,223 --> 00:41:02,214
l'll be waiting in my car.
Right?

517
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:03,975
- Sure, thanks.
- Ciao.

518
00:41:04,143 --> 00:41:05,178
Good evening.

519
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:06,378
Simone!

520
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:09,972
- There's a fight going on outside!
- A fight?

521
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:12,703
- Yeah! - But where?
- Come on! Quick!

522
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:18,335
Trai-tor! Trai-tor!

523
00:41:31,983 --> 00:41:33,052
Cowards!

524
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:35,737
Cowards!

525
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:44,537
Come away.

526
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,136
Move!

527
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:59,860
- Move!
- Vincenzo!

528
00:42:01,183 --> 00:42:03,936
- Let me go!
- Come away!

529
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:08,057
Alfredo, wait!
We have a score to settle.

530
00:42:08,223 --> 00:42:10,373
l've already settled everything.

531
00:42:10,543 --> 00:42:12,022
l'll be the one to settle it.

532
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:15,255
- Wait! l'll handle this!
- Shut up, and go home!

533
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,733
- Move!
- Ginetta!

534
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:21,934
l said go home!

535
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:29,697
- Leave me alone!
- Ciro!

536
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:36,540
Trai-tor! Trai-tor!

537
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:55,137
Remember me?

538
00:42:55,463 --> 00:42:56,942
Of course.

539
00:42:58,543 --> 00:42:59,293
Well?

540
00:43:00,063 --> 00:43:02,372
- You coming?
- l'm coming.

541
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,534
So you decided to box.

542
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:40,495
A good idea. Yeah!

543
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,738
lt's a nice profession.

544
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:52,419
Taste good?

545
00:43:56,903 --> 00:43:59,656
lf l'm not mistaken, you box..

546
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:02,735
..the way l put out.

547
00:44:04,663 --> 00:44:05,857
For money.

548
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:09,099
No, l box with feeling.

549
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:10,777
With feeling?

550
00:44:11,263 --> 00:44:15,017
Yeah, well,
l work with feeling too!

551
00:44:22,103 --> 00:44:23,331
And your brother?

552
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:25,618
Which one?

553
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:30,778
The oldest. The one
who called the police.

554
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:34,618
What a day!

555
00:44:35,303 --> 00:44:37,942
First it snowed, then my father,..

556
00:44:39,903 --> 00:44:42,178
..then running away....

557
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:45,861
l never could stand the police.

558
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:48,742
Even as a kid.
You can imagine now!

559
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,818
l'm tired.

560
00:44:59,023 --> 00:45:00,900
l'll sleep and you'll disappear.

561
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:02,735
- No.
- Yes, you will.

562
00:45:04,023 --> 00:45:06,218
Because l'm telling you to.

563
00:45:07,823 --> 00:45:09,495
l like sleeping alone.

564
00:45:11,023 --> 00:45:12,661
That's why l left home.

565
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:16,859
When l was little,
my father..

566
00:45:18,023 --> 00:45:19,934
..took sick,
and was hospitalized,..

567
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,095
..and we ended up
staying with an uncle.

568
00:45:25,663 --> 00:45:28,894
After the war,
houses were hard to find.

569
00:45:30,543 --> 00:45:34,252
l remember we were
all together,..

570
00:45:35,863 --> 00:45:37,137
..crammed in one room.

571
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:39,462
Like your house.

572
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:44,821
On summer mornings,
once school let out,..

573
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:48,135
..we'd play in the courtyard.

574
00:45:49,383 --> 00:45:51,658
l was big for my age..

575
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:54,534
..and didn't like kids' games.

576
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:57,861
So l'd just watch.

577
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:04,058
The dentist from the ground floor..

578
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:08,739
..beckoned to me.

579
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:13,261
After that,
l started going there nights.

580
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:17,215
A great improvement.

581
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:20,337
Now we were only two in a bed.

582
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,939
- How old were you?
- 1 3.

583
00:46:26,943 --> 00:46:30,413
lt's not true, it's not true
about the dentist.

584
00:46:31,463 --> 00:46:33,499
l was happy as a child.

585
00:46:35,783 --> 00:46:37,580
The trouble started later on.

586
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,101
Please, l'm so tired.

587
00:46:44,103 --> 00:46:46,571
l already told you, go!

588
00:46:49,263 --> 00:46:50,378
What is it?

589
00:46:51,543 --> 00:46:52,578
Again?

590
00:47:10,183 --> 00:47:13,653
l'm over here!

591
00:47:14,303 --> 00:47:16,021
Coming!

592
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:25,259
- Well?
- Here...

593
00:47:29,143 --> 00:47:31,782
These are the notices
for night school.

594
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,139
They were free,..

595
00:47:34,303 --> 00:47:36,771
..but you need an elementary
school certificate.

596
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,416
l have one.

597
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:40,540
- Here!
- What's that?

598
00:47:44,663 --> 00:47:46,460
Stop wasting your money!

599
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:48,739
Simone gave it to me.

600
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,256
Ah, Simone!
Did he go to work?

601
00:47:52,863 --> 00:47:55,138
He was sleeping when l left.

602
00:47:55,503 --> 00:47:57,733
He never works mornings.

603
00:47:57,903 --> 00:48:00,497
Yeah, and who knows
what he works at?

604
00:48:01,143 --> 00:48:04,658
Something good! He gave
Mamma 2,000 liras yesterday.

605
00:48:05,543 --> 00:48:07,295
And what're you doing?

606
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:10,580
l'm a delivery boy for the grocer
near our house.

607
00:48:13,263 --> 00:48:16,733
As soon as l turn twenty,
l'll show you all!

608
00:48:17,463 --> 00:48:19,181
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

609
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:33,298
Are you sure you know
how to read?

610
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:37,580
Everything's such a mess
since you've been here.

611
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,858
- lt's not this one.
- lt is. Look!

612
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:42,934
- No.
- That's not true,..

613
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:46,220
..lt's always been a mess.
- No, it hasn't.

614
00:48:46,503 --> 00:48:48,812
Give me the receipts,
and l'll check.

615
00:48:49,503 --> 00:48:52,779
- They're all scrambled up.
- Now, let's see.

616
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,658
The boss said
she's got a headache.

617
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:58,098
She probably didn't sleep
last night, poor thing.

618
00:48:58,303 --> 00:49:03,423
Can't you remember his name?
Try, at least.

619
00:49:03,623 --> 00:49:06,012
He's only been here a month.

620
00:49:06,223 --> 00:49:09,533
A year wouldn't be enough
time, huh, Rocco?

621
00:49:09,903 --> 00:49:11,302
Our ''Sleeping Beauty''!

622
00:49:11,663 --> 00:49:15,053
lda, give him a kiss,
that might wake him.

623
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,458
My boyfriend would kill me.

624
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,892
l'll do it.

625
00:49:24,823 --> 00:49:26,302
Oooh, a customer!

626
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,853
- Hello? Signora Ubaldi?
- Who's he?

627
00:49:30,063 --> 00:49:31,257
My brother.

628
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,734
Tell him to come round
the back or clear off.

629
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:36,542
The boss doesn't want
relatives visiting in the shop.

630
00:49:36,703 --> 00:49:39,297
- Good morning, you girls.
- Good morning.

631
00:49:39,783 --> 00:49:43,139
Just what l need!

632
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:50,220
You never said
it was such a nice place.

633
00:49:51,143 --> 00:49:52,815
You hang your clothes
there, and....

634
00:49:53,063 --> 00:49:56,021
Can't you read?
You come in, undress..

635
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:58,534
..and go out brand new.

636
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:00,415
Exactly what l wanted!

637
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,817
How fast can you do it?

638
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:04,053
lt's expensive.

639
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:05,139
So who cares?!

640
00:50:08,223 --> 00:50:09,338
What's going on?

641
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:15,533
They said they'd make me
over in 5 minutes.

642
00:50:16,543 --> 00:50:18,613
- You want proof?
- Yes.

643
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:22,140
- ln the booth. Giannini,
take care of him. - Thanks.

644
00:50:22,383 --> 00:50:25,136
- Rocco, you're still here?
- lt's his brother.

645
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:27,414
Show her the package.

646
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:30,654
There's no receipt.

647
00:50:30,823 --> 00:50:32,859
lt belongs to your relative...
what's-her-name....

648
00:50:33,023 --> 00:50:34,741
lt's Signora Brighetti!

649
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:37,172
Here are my trousers.

650
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:41,498
And wait, here's my shirt.

651
00:50:43,703 --> 00:50:45,580
- Ma'am!
- Yes?

652
00:50:47,383 --> 00:50:48,862
Can we do this shirt?

653
00:50:50,903 --> 00:50:52,018
No, not the shirt.

654
00:50:53,623 --> 00:50:55,579
- lt's too frayed.
- What a shame...

655
00:50:56,143 --> 00:50:58,498
- Then what'll l do?
- l can't.

656
00:50:59,023 --> 00:50:59,978
Let me see what we can do here.

657
00:51:01,943 --> 00:51:04,935
Rocco, hurry!
You'll be late.

658
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,297
Come here.

659
00:51:07,223 --> 00:51:08,702
We gotta talk.

660
00:51:09,663 --> 00:51:11,176
The rest was just for fun.

661
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:13,292
Pardon us, my friend.

662
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:18,014
Rocco! l got something
important going.

663
00:51:19,783 --> 00:51:21,057
Did you get paid yet?

664
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:26,696
- Tonight.
- l need the money now.

665
00:51:27,143 --> 00:51:31,136
Tell them at the gym.
l'll be gone 2 days.

666
00:51:31,703 --> 00:51:33,933
Rocco,
don't lend him anything.

667
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:36,059
l thought you liked me.

668
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:40,176
l'm protecting Rocco,
he should be wary of you.

669
00:51:41,063 --> 00:51:43,258
- You'll do it?
- Sure.

670
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:47,454
What should l give him?

671
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:49,661
Half a month's wages?

672
00:51:51,183 --> 00:51:53,697
- Yes, Signora.
- After taxes, that is.

673
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,132
- Of course.
- Fine.

674
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,581
- Does Mamma know?
- She knows.

675
00:52:01,943 --> 00:52:03,058
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

676
00:52:05,023 --> 00:52:06,581
Rocco, come here.

677
00:52:21,783 --> 00:52:24,172
Your trousers
are almost ready.

678
00:52:24,343 --> 00:52:27,255
May l have the jacket?
Just a couple of minutes.

679
00:52:28,663 --> 00:52:30,335
- Ah... here.
- Thanks.

680
00:52:31,943 --> 00:52:33,615
Sign this.

681
00:52:34,103 --> 00:52:36,901
The trousers!

682
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:42,780
- That was fast.
- l told you so.

683
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:44,092
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

684
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:46,737
Here's the coffee
and aspirin you ordered.

685
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,494
l feel like l'm brand new.
Thanks.

686
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:53,335
Drop in again, sir. Goodbye.

687
00:52:54,183 --> 00:52:57,016
- Here l am.
- Look at him, will you!

688
00:52:57,743 --> 00:52:59,256
You could use a new shirt.

689
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:01,497
Like those.

690
00:53:02,303 --> 00:53:04,214
They're Dr. Fossati's shirts!

691
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:07,980
They'd look better
on someone like you.

692
00:53:08,743 --> 00:53:12,099
But that's life:
luxuries always come too late.

693
00:53:13,743 --> 00:53:17,099
Your brother's 5,000 liras.
You owe me 700.

694
00:53:17,983 --> 00:53:20,702
Don't have it.
Rocco will pay you.

695
00:53:22,543 --> 00:53:25,103
Ma'am, good day
and many thanks.

696
00:53:25,383 --> 00:53:28,659
- Good day!
- See you soon!

697
00:53:32,103 --> 00:53:34,173
Well?

698
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:37,741
No, please... my head!

699
00:53:38,623 --> 00:53:40,261
Go on! Faster!

700
00:53:41,103 --> 00:53:42,331
Close the door, boy.

701
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:48,418
Did you hear me?
What do you want?

702
00:53:51,623 --> 00:53:52,419
Well?

703
00:53:52,903 --> 00:53:56,612
My brother, Simone, is sick.
He won't be coming.

704
00:53:56,783 --> 00:53:58,057
Great!

705
00:53:58,463 --> 00:54:02,422
Sick? They saw him in town.

706
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:04,892
l wouldn't know about that.

707
00:54:05,263 --> 00:54:07,697
There's a draft, come in!

708
00:54:07,943 --> 00:54:11,015
You know nothing,
but l'm on to him.

709
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:17,860
You're his brother?
Then listen.

710
00:54:18,103 --> 00:54:21,379
lnstead of helping him,
l should have hung him.

711
00:54:22,623 --> 00:54:23,578
That's it!

712
00:54:23,823 --> 00:54:25,973
That's enough, all of you...
Clear out!

713
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:30,978
l shouldn't have
brought him here.

714
00:54:31,503 --> 00:54:35,132
l admit it: my mistake.
Never again!

715
00:54:38,823 --> 00:54:40,495
That's it for today.

716
00:54:45,623 --> 00:54:48,262
- So you're Simone's
brother, huh? - Yes.

717
00:54:48,903 --> 00:54:52,134
Your brother's got a nice
build, a good punch..

718
00:54:52,743 --> 00:54:56,577
..but he's slow. He should
work out more than the others.

719
00:54:58,983 --> 00:55:01,178
My office.

720
00:55:02,743 --> 00:55:05,701
They trained with me,
fine boxers.

721
00:55:06,063 --> 00:55:07,018
Thanks to me.

722
00:55:10,543 --> 00:55:11,532
Close the door.

723
00:55:15,423 --> 00:55:18,062
Want to help
before it's too late?

724
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:23,691
Come to the gym together,
you and him.

725
00:55:24,183 --> 00:55:26,333
- Me?
- Yeah.

726
00:55:26,983 --> 00:55:30,339
Stay with him, never let him
out of your sight.

727
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:33,699
- Your name?
- Rocco.

728
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:37,421
Like Rocco Mazzola.
From Lucania, like you!

729
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,301
You're a good kid.

730
00:55:39,463 --> 00:55:43,172
lt won't cost you anything,
just look after your brother.

731
00:55:44,183 --> 00:55:49,211
And stop him from hanging out
with certain people.

732
00:55:50,463 --> 00:55:52,374
Boxing's a serious thing..

733
00:55:52,543 --> 00:55:56,252
.. you've gotta lead
a clean life. Like them.

734
00:55:57,223 --> 00:55:59,896
Good morals are the first
requisite of an athlete.

735
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:04,902
Meaning that... women,
cigarettes, drinking..

736
00:56:07,023 --> 00:56:10,060
..and many other things
are taboo.

737
00:56:10,943 --> 00:56:11,898
Absolutely taboo.

738
00:56:12,823 --> 00:56:14,541
Look at that motor-boat.

739
00:56:17,463 --> 00:56:18,339
Let's go, come on!

740
00:56:20,783 --> 00:56:23,581
- 'Bye, now.
- Happy Easter.

741
00:56:30,943 --> 00:56:32,217
What's that?

742
00:56:32,383 --> 00:56:36,342
A hotel,
first class, sweetie!

743
00:56:36,823 --> 00:56:38,654
- Can we see it?
- Why not?

744
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,099
lt's called
''The Great Britain''.

745
00:56:42,463 --> 00:56:46,138
English tourists used
to crowd here to Bellagio.

746
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,942
People are here now
because it's Easter.

747
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:52,859
lt's got 200, 250 rooms....

748
00:56:53,263 --> 00:56:55,902
- See you around.
- 'Bye, now.

749
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,291
A garden!

750
00:56:57,463 --> 00:57:00,136
And it's fabulous.
You should see it inside.

751
00:57:01,743 --> 00:57:03,495
l was in there once.

752
00:57:03,663 --> 00:57:06,177
- You were in it?
- lnside! lt's fantastic!

753
00:57:06,903 --> 00:57:11,260
You should see the rooms,
not like our pension.

754
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:16,778
The place is super, really.

755
00:57:17,543 --> 00:57:19,056
So are the prices.

756
00:57:20,903 --> 00:57:23,622
- Know what they ask? For a room?
- No.

757
00:57:24,863 --> 00:57:27,775
10,000 liras, just for the room.

758
00:57:30,023 --> 00:57:31,581
10 times 30....

759
00:57:34,063 --> 00:57:36,418
300,000 liras a month
just for a room?

760
00:57:36,863 --> 00:57:37,898
That's a lot!

761
00:57:38,743 --> 00:57:41,052
They're crazy.
How's it possible?

762
00:57:42,103 --> 00:57:45,015
Anyway,
very soon we'll come here.

763
00:57:46,503 --> 00:57:48,095
Want to bet?

764
00:57:48,263 --> 00:57:50,333
When l turn professional.

765
00:57:50,663 --> 00:57:54,053
- Got a cigarette?
- What a place! Gee!

766
00:57:56,303 --> 00:57:58,100
- Want one?
- Oh, no, no. l shouldn't.

767
00:57:58,423 --> 00:57:59,651
The boxer!

768
00:58:07,463 --> 00:58:08,418
l'll keep them.

769
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,376
What'll you earn?

770
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:15,054
Plenty.
But l gotta train hard.

771
00:58:16,303 --> 00:58:19,181
lt'll be a sacrifice.
For you too.

772
00:58:19,983 --> 00:58:21,336
Why for me?

773
00:58:21,903 --> 00:58:25,293
When you're in training,
you can't....

774
00:58:26,463 --> 00:58:31,218
Let's get something straight.
We're not married.

775
00:58:32,423 --> 00:58:34,414
We just go out sometimes.

776
00:58:35,543 --> 00:58:38,455
We may not go out
for another year.

777
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:41,062
But now we're together.

778
00:58:43,343 --> 00:58:45,811
l needed a change of air.

779
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:48,100
Without attracting
too much attention.

780
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:52,657
After each affair,
a nice clean break.

781
00:58:53,423 --> 00:58:53,935
Scram!

782
00:58:55,423 --> 00:58:56,651
You get me?

783
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,181
- Miss!
- Are you talking to me?

784
00:59:04,383 --> 00:59:07,102
You can't stay here.
l'm sorry, but....

785
00:59:08,023 --> 00:59:09,820
ls it reserved?

786
00:59:09,983 --> 00:59:11,780
What's wrong, we got lice?

787
00:59:11,943 --> 00:59:13,501
- l'm sorry.
- That's the limit!

788
00:59:13,663 --> 00:59:15,494
We gotta pay?

789
00:59:15,663 --> 00:59:16,937
l just follow orders.

790
00:59:17,103 --> 00:59:19,492
He follows orders!

791
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:21,813
Well, l happen to like it here!

792
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:25,578
Good day, sir!
My regards to the manager!

793
00:59:25,943 --> 00:59:28,582
You want money,
you little twerp?!

794
00:59:37,383 --> 00:59:39,260
- Bye, Rocco!
- Ciao.

795
00:59:54,703 --> 00:59:56,421
- Rocco!
- What is it?

796
00:59:57,783 --> 00:59:58,818
Seen my brother?

797
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:00,621
He just left.
Didn't you bump into him?

798
01:00:01,303 --> 01:00:02,452
No, we didn't.

799
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:04,057
Who's there?

800
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:06,731
Just me.
l'm Rocco's brother.

801
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:10,100
l have a package here.
l'll come by tomorrow.

802
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:13,543
l'll leave it with
the janitor.

803
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:16,417
Leave it in the shop. Come on.

804
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:19,211
Through there.
The door on the left.

805
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:21,339
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

806
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:25,097
May l?

807
01:00:26,143 --> 01:00:28,099
- Anybody here?
- Come in.

808
01:00:31,303 --> 01:00:33,863
- Ah. Well, how are you?
- Oh, it's you.

809
01:00:34,903 --> 01:00:38,657
One of the girls said
l could leave this package.

810
01:00:39,063 --> 01:00:41,861
She didn't say you were here.
Just as well.

811
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:42,773
What is it?

812
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:49,777
Try to understand...

813
01:00:53,743 --> 01:00:55,699
lt needs washing.
lt's not mine.

814
01:00:56,343 --> 01:00:59,062
lt's one of the shirts
that were there.

815
01:00:59,783 --> 01:01:02,092
l only wore it once.

816
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:06,418
You said it would look better
on someone like me....

817
01:01:07,423 --> 01:01:09,493
What? Have you gone mad?!

818
01:01:10,303 --> 01:01:11,099
Answer me!

819
01:01:12,263 --> 01:01:15,619
And stop laughing! You come in
here asking favors..

820
01:01:15,783 --> 01:01:19,139
..and then ridicule
our courtesy..

821
01:01:19,463 --> 01:01:21,454
..with your insolence!

822
01:01:22,743 --> 01:01:25,211
- Thief!
- l wasn't really stealing.

823
01:01:26,423 --> 01:01:28,539
That's hard to believe!

824
01:01:32,983 --> 01:01:37,022
You take advantage of people's
kindness and generosity.

825
01:01:37,743 --> 01:01:42,373
l'm so gullible, ready
to believe everyone and everything.

826
01:01:42,823 --> 01:01:45,701
lt's a struggle for
a woman alone,..

827
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:47,495
..to keep track
of everything.

828
01:01:50,863 --> 01:01:52,296
What do you want?

829
01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:03,895
No, don't...

830
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:33,938
Why do they suspect you?

831
01:02:34,103 --> 01:02:35,502
l don't know.

832
01:02:35,903 --> 01:02:38,019
The boss keeps watching me.

833
01:02:38,343 --> 01:02:39,696
She's a little crazy.

834
01:02:41,343 --> 01:02:42,412
That's true.

835
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:48,582
But the girls
keep watching me too.

836
01:02:49,943 --> 01:02:53,492
- Tomorrow let's go to the police
and straighten it out. - Yeah.

837
01:02:55,263 --> 01:02:56,332
Parondi!

838
01:02:56,503 --> 01:02:58,061
Parondi,
you're wanted at the entrance!

839
01:02:58,743 --> 01:03:00,813
They've come to arrest me!

840
01:03:01,663 --> 01:03:03,733
Who's calling our name?

841
01:03:08,823 --> 01:03:11,542
- No, l'll go.
- Yes, you go.

842
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:18,453
- What's up?
- They want Vincenzo Parondi..

843
01:03:18,623 --> 01:03:20,534
..upstairs.
- Vincenzo?

844
01:03:22,303 --> 01:03:24,180
He's not here.

845
01:03:25,663 --> 01:03:29,815
You know where he is?
What do they want?

846
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,771
l don't know. l'll go.

847
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,740
- Yes.
- Goodnight.

848
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:40,540
Do you know what they want
with him and at this hour?

849
01:03:40,703 --> 01:03:42,819
- lt's not that late.
- What time is it?

850
01:03:42,983 --> 01:03:44,575
- lt's only 10.
- Oh.

851
01:03:45,783 --> 01:03:47,057
Go back to bed.

852
01:03:50,143 --> 01:03:51,178
Shall l come?

853
01:03:51,663 --> 01:03:52,982
You stay here with Mamma.

854
01:03:56,383 --> 01:03:58,374
- Ciao, Rocco!
- Good night.

855
01:04:06,623 --> 01:04:07,897
What's wrong?

856
01:04:08,063 --> 01:04:10,133
Go to sleep.

857
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,213
What about you?
When'll you finish?

858
01:04:17,223 --> 01:04:21,660
l still have to study.
l'll wait up for Rocco.

859
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:24,217
All right.

860
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:32,541
Simone isn't back yet...

861
01:04:35,143 --> 01:04:37,532
Neither is Vincenzo.
Oh, these boys!

862
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:45,052
Hey, you! Hurry up.

863
01:04:47,503 --> 01:04:49,971
- Am l the one you want?
- You're Vincenzo?

864
01:04:50,183 --> 01:04:52,378
No, he's with Ginetta.

865
01:04:52,743 --> 01:04:55,860
They're engaged,
but Mamma doesn't approve..

866
01:04:56,023 --> 01:05:01,222
..so they meet outside
otherwise she makes a scene.

867
01:05:01,383 --> 01:05:03,817
l don't want your family history.

868
01:05:04,143 --> 01:05:06,782
- Who are you?
- Rocco.

869
01:05:07,543 --> 01:05:08,976
Oh, yeah...

870
01:05:09,703 --> 01:05:11,455
l have to talk to you.
Hop in.

871
01:05:13,103 --> 01:05:15,094
Not here. The other side.

872
01:05:21,783 --> 01:05:24,377
lf l don't practise driving,
l'll never learn.

873
01:05:26,063 --> 01:05:27,542
ls that street one-way?

874
01:05:29,463 --> 01:05:31,852
- l don't drive.
- Oh, great!

875
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:37,379
Yup, it's one-way.

876
01:05:42,183 --> 01:05:44,777
The whole world's
a one-way street.

877
01:05:47,463 --> 01:05:50,899
- Where we going?
- Where l won't meet anybody.

878
01:05:55,143 --> 01:05:56,292
This is good.

879
01:05:57,663 --> 01:06:01,212
l asked for Vincenzo because
l know him better,..

880
01:06:02,103 --> 01:06:03,422
..but you'll do.

881
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:06,255
Do you recognize this?

882
01:06:10,543 --> 01:06:12,977
Simone says he bought it,..

883
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:16,692
..l say he stole it.
And l don't care where.

884
01:06:17,783 --> 01:06:21,776
l've got enough troubles.
l can't take risks.

885
01:06:24,663 --> 01:06:26,381
Do you understand?

886
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:28,452
Great!

887
01:06:29,783 --> 01:06:32,775
- Why steal...?
- To make me happy.

888
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:36,454
Seems l'm worth it.
l'm not?

889
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:40,693
What are you wearing under there?

890
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:42,692
l was already in bed.

891
01:06:47,183 --> 01:06:49,333
You're nice and warm.

892
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:53,100
Don't worry, l don't bite.

893
01:06:54,983 --> 01:06:58,100
Tell your brother that
l'm giving back this stuff.

894
01:06:58,263 --> 01:07:01,221
Thank him, but tell him not
to come looking for me.

895
01:07:01,463 --> 01:07:02,691
You understand?

896
01:07:03,823 --> 01:07:05,893
''Nadia's left.
She's gone forever''.

897
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:10,859
What are you staring at?
l look strange, or something?

898
01:07:11,943 --> 01:07:14,776
No, you're not strange.
You're very considerate.

899
01:07:16,263 --> 01:07:19,539
- Why did he do it?
- Why do you think?

900
01:07:19,863 --> 01:07:23,378
Good night, little boy.
l'm glad you find me considerate.

901
01:07:24,823 --> 01:07:27,656
Sorry l can't drive you back,
it's late.

902
01:07:28,663 --> 01:07:34,260
Stop being so scared.
Now beat it!

903
01:07:38,303 --> 01:07:38,974
Hey!

904
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:16,973
You're back!
Who'd they want, you or me?

905
01:08:18,903 --> 01:08:23,579
They wanted me, at the shop,
for the keys to the storeroom.

906
01:08:24,023 --> 01:08:26,491
- The keys to the storeroom?
- Yes.

907
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,979
And the theft?

908
01:08:35,983 --> 01:08:39,658
There wasn't one. She found
the pin. lt wasn't stolen.

909
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:43,575
- She's crazy.
- l told you.

910
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:49,854
- l'm quitting.
- But it's a good job.

911
01:08:50,823 --> 01:08:52,017
Not any more.

912
01:08:53,183 --> 01:08:56,220
You should find something
better before quitting.

913
01:08:57,023 --> 01:08:58,058
l did.

914
01:09:00,823 --> 01:09:03,656
See this?
lt's my draft card.

915
01:09:04,823 --> 01:09:06,495
lt came this morning.

916
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:10,892
But with everything going on,
l forgot about it.

917
01:09:12,223 --> 01:09:14,657
- l've been drafted.
- Good luck, then.

918
01:09:18,543 --> 01:09:20,215
You hear that?

919
01:09:20,383 --> 01:09:23,181
lt's his turn now.
Good night.

920
01:09:24,223 --> 01:09:26,214
- Simone?
- What?

921
01:09:28,263 --> 01:09:29,742
l'd like to talk to you.

922
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:36,496
Coming back from the shop,
l ran into a girl.

923
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:44,297
The daughter of that family
at Lambrate, remember?

924
01:09:45,103 --> 01:09:46,172
Yeah.

925
01:09:48,103 --> 01:09:51,812
She said she's leaving,
going away.

926
01:09:52,703 --> 01:09:55,661
- When did you see her?
- Just now.

927
01:09:56,463 --> 01:09:58,215
Going where?

928
01:09:59,263 --> 01:10:01,982
She didn't say.

929
01:10:08,743 --> 01:10:10,415
You know her too?

930
01:10:13,863 --> 01:10:16,297
What's she want?
What's with her, anyway?

931
01:10:18,023 --> 01:10:20,173
She's just another girl..

932
01:10:24,623 --> 01:10:26,534
..trying to be a lady.

933
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:29,422
Who needs her?!

934
01:10:33,503 --> 01:10:35,221
l got better things to do.

935
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:45,414
From now on,
l don't know who she is.

936
01:10:47,463 --> 01:10:50,057
lf you see her tell her that!

937
01:11:51,463 --> 01:11:55,536
''We finally moved into
the new apartment.''

938
01:11:56,303 --> 01:11:59,739
''Everyone knows us since Simone
won that fight in Genoa.''

939
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:05,933
''They treat me with respect.
lt would have been a good year..''

940
01:12:06,263 --> 01:12:10,893
''..but Vincenzo got Ginetta
pregnant and had to marry her.''

941
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,539
''Now he's gone, and you're off
doing military service.''

942
01:12:18,743 --> 01:12:22,656
''Simone can't work, because
he has to keep training.''

943
01:12:23,543 --> 01:12:28,094
''Ciro has a new job
at the Alfa Romeo plant..''

944
01:12:28,703 --> 01:12:30,978
''..thanks to his night
school diploma.''

945
01:12:32,983 --> 01:12:37,579
''He's the only one bringing
any money in. And the expenses!''

946
01:12:38,263 --> 01:12:41,858
''lf you have anything left
from your pay, send it.''

947
01:12:42,023 --> 01:12:45,174
''You can't spend it anyhow.
We're all well.''

948
01:12:45,383 --> 01:12:48,932
''l hope you are too. A big hug
from, your loving Mother.''

949
01:13:10,383 --> 01:13:11,133
Hey!

950
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,934
l wasn't wrong, it's you.

951
01:13:17,263 --> 01:13:19,060
What's with that getup?

952
01:13:19,543 --> 01:13:20,737
l'm a soldier.

953
01:13:20,903 --> 01:13:23,292
That's pretty obvious.
Since when?

954
01:13:24,183 --> 01:13:25,662
l've served 1 4 months.

955
01:13:25,823 --> 01:13:30,055
Me too. More or less.
ln this same town.

956
01:13:32,423 --> 01:13:34,653
Buy me a coffee.

957
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:38,299
l'd like to, but l just sent
money to my mother.

958
01:13:39,823 --> 01:13:41,336
l'll buy, you chump!

959
01:13:42,183 --> 01:13:45,653
Better yet, we'll hire
a carriage and ride through town....

960
01:13:46,143 --> 01:13:47,337
l'll take your bag.

961
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:50,814
....and have coffee
in a decent place.

962
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:54,533
Driver, put the top down,
we need some air.

963
01:14:18,743 --> 01:14:20,813
- You didn't understand?
- No.

964
01:14:24,703 --> 01:14:27,058
1 3 months and 8 days.

965
01:14:29,783 --> 01:14:34,982
No suspended sentence
because of my record.

966
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,532
Was it bad?

967
01:14:40,263 --> 01:14:43,175
Fairly but bearable.

968
01:14:45,263 --> 01:14:48,380
Time flies
when every day's the same.

969
01:14:50,343 --> 01:14:54,052
Wouldn't seem so but it's true.

970
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:09,619
Hey, wake up!

971
01:15:12,223 --> 01:15:15,135
Does knowing
an ex-inmate bother you?

972
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:17,379
lt's not that unusual.

973
01:15:18,863 --> 01:15:20,182
There wasn't only me.

974
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:23,739
But l'm the first one you've met?

975
01:15:24,343 --> 01:15:29,781
No, some friends in my home town,..

976
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:36,063
..my own age,
poorer than you could ever imagine.

977
01:15:37,423 --> 01:15:41,462
They were lead to believe
they could farm some land.

978
01:15:42,263 --> 01:15:45,539
But the land was arid, and the work
backbreaking, and it took hours..

979
01:15:46,983 --> 01:15:54,139
..to reach the place. Then one day,
they spoke up, and rebelled.

980
01:15:57,343 --> 01:16:01,734
They were arrested..

981
01:16:03,623 --> 01:16:05,693
..in Matera, in Potenza.

982
01:16:08,343 --> 01:16:10,220
My town was like that.

983
01:16:15,263 --> 01:16:18,972
l understand.
That's why you all came North?

984
01:16:19,263 --> 01:16:20,981
l'd have stayed.

985
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:23,179
You don't like Milan?

986
01:16:23,863 --> 01:16:29,893
lf only we had the means
to live decently,..

987
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,059
..here where we grew up.

988
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:36,257
l'm lost in the city.

989
01:16:36,503 --> 01:16:39,734
l was neither born
nor raised in one.

990
01:16:41,703 --> 01:16:45,616
Not only me,
but my brothers and my friends.

991
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,615
Some get used to city life,..

992
01:16:51,463 --> 01:16:53,977
..and seek
the pleasures of city people.

993
01:16:55,463 --> 01:16:56,100
Not me.

994
01:16:58,503 --> 01:17:00,334
l don't think that's right.

995
01:17:03,503 --> 01:17:08,019
l mean,
l want an automobile too.

996
01:17:08,703 --> 01:17:11,661
But after the things
that come first,..

997
01:17:12,023 --> 01:17:16,141
..a steady job, a home,
and eating every day.

998
01:17:17,463 --> 01:17:19,294
Do l make myself clear?

999
01:17:20,743 --> 01:17:22,176
Your opinion of me?

1000
01:17:23,303 --> 01:17:24,053
Nothing.

1001
01:17:24,543 --> 01:17:25,612
Aren't you curious?

1002
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,179
Speak up.

1003
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:33,413
l was wondering...
How old are you?

1004
01:17:35,423 --> 01:17:36,697
That's easy,..

1005
01:17:37,983 --> 01:17:39,541
..25, so what?

1006
01:17:40,183 --> 01:17:42,617
You said:
''Aren't you curious?''....

1007
01:17:43,343 --> 01:17:45,095
Nothing else interests you?

1008
01:17:45,543 --> 01:17:47,101
l offended you.

1009
01:17:48,183 --> 01:17:49,457
Did you?

1010
01:17:52,183 --> 01:17:54,299
You keep staring at me...

1011
01:17:56,823 --> 01:17:58,051
Forgive me.

1012
01:17:59,463 --> 01:18:03,695
But, somehow,
l feel great pity for you.

1013
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:06,736
How nice!

1014
01:18:09,743 --> 01:18:11,574
Actually, l'm very tired.

1015
01:18:13,663 --> 01:18:16,336
l wasn't exactly on vacation,..

1016
01:18:17,223 --> 01:18:19,054
..and what's to come is worse.

1017
01:18:19,623 --> 01:18:23,013
Don't say that.
One can live as he likes,..

1018
01:18:23,183 --> 01:18:24,741
..if he chooses to.

1019
01:18:25,903 --> 01:18:30,533
But you shouldn't be afraid
and you seem to be.

1020
01:18:31,143 --> 01:18:32,895
You're really something.

1021
01:18:35,903 --> 01:18:39,293
Say no more. Look
at the effect you have on me.

1022
01:18:39,663 --> 01:18:41,893
You want me to go?

1023
01:18:42,143 --> 01:18:44,782
What a dope!
Take me to the station,..

1024
01:18:46,503 --> 01:18:50,576
..but enough talk about me,
it's depressing.

1025
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:55,537
What's your cure?

1026
01:18:57,543 --> 01:19:02,094
Have faith and have no fear.
Great faith...

1027
01:19:04,623 --> 01:19:05,942
ln what?

1028
01:19:06,103 --> 01:19:08,014
l don't know...
in everything.

1029
01:19:11,423 --> 01:19:12,333
ln you?

1030
01:19:13,023 --> 01:19:14,251
ln me too.

1031
01:19:17,743 --> 01:19:20,257
- Can we meet in Milan?
- Yes.

1032
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:24,695
Maybe you can teach me
not to be afraid.

1033
01:19:27,103 --> 01:19:27,660
Sure!

1034
01:19:29,823 --> 01:19:30,619
Yes.

1035
01:20:06,943 --> 01:20:07,853
Rocco.

1036
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:12,054
Mamma's boy Rocco.

1037
01:20:14,503 --> 01:20:17,142
Oh, my boy, you're so handsome!

1038
01:20:18,943 --> 01:20:20,171
Come on!

1039
01:20:21,343 --> 01:20:23,618
l was just
getting your bed ready.

1040
01:20:23,783 --> 01:20:26,251
They delivered it yesterday.

1041
01:20:27,103 --> 01:20:31,062
Look at him, he's just back
from the service!

1042
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:33,420
Let them see you.

1043
01:20:34,143 --> 01:20:36,338
How handsome my boy is!

1044
01:20:36,703 --> 01:20:39,854
See, not much furniture,
but we'll get there.

1045
01:20:40,383 --> 01:20:44,058
Ah, but Saint Rocco
is always in my bedroom.

1046
01:20:45,343 --> 01:20:46,298
You look good.

1047
01:20:46,463 --> 01:20:49,261
Oh, but my teeth are troubling me.

1048
01:20:49,743 --> 01:20:51,142
You like it here?

1049
01:20:52,543 --> 01:20:53,862
Yes, but....

1050
01:20:55,703 --> 01:20:56,738
Where's everybody?

1051
01:20:57,303 --> 01:21:01,455
l purposely came on Sunday
when everyone's home.

1052
01:21:02,543 --> 01:21:05,137
- l even wrote.
- l know but....

1053
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:09,496
l kept saying: Ciro will surely
meet me at the station.

1054
01:21:12,943 --> 01:21:15,616
They'll be here at noon.
Don't be upset.

1055
01:21:17,183 --> 01:21:20,778
Tell me where to put your bed.
Come on!

1056
01:21:22,983 --> 01:21:26,339
l sleep there with Luca.
You three'll sleep here.

1057
01:21:26,503 --> 01:21:30,576
Simone, Ciro,
and you, my sweet boy!

1058
01:21:34,463 --> 01:21:35,452
You know...

1059
01:21:36,943 --> 01:21:40,731
Ciro's been so wonderful,
you can't imagine!

1060
01:21:44,463 --> 01:21:46,977
They're at the Baptism
of Vincenzo's baby.

1061
01:21:47,983 --> 01:21:49,462
- And you're not going?
- Not me. No.

1062
01:21:50,463 --> 01:21:53,455
- Why is that?
- You were arriving.

1063
01:21:53,823 --> 01:21:56,417
That's no reason,
l could've joined you.

1064
01:21:56,983 --> 01:22:00,692
- Let's go now.
- No, it's too late now.

1065
01:22:05,143 --> 01:22:08,260
You're not still angry
with Vincenzo?

1066
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:12,416
No, he always comes
to visit me.

1067
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:17,300
- And Ginetta?
- Not Ginetta.

1068
01:22:19,263 --> 01:22:21,697
Not even now
that she's had the baby?

1069
01:22:22,343 --> 01:22:25,301
Do you think her folks invite
your brother?

1070
01:22:26,703 --> 01:22:29,979
Let me go.
l'd like to see them.

1071
01:22:32,663 --> 01:22:33,652
Go ahead.

1072
01:22:35,223 --> 01:22:35,894
Thanks.

1073
01:22:39,983 --> 01:22:42,053
- Ciao, Mamma.
- Ciao.

1074
01:22:57,463 --> 01:23:01,172
- Ciao, Luca. Ciao, Vincenzo.
- So, you're back!

1075
01:23:03,023 --> 01:23:05,298
Ciao, Ginetta.
He's so handsome!

1076
01:23:05,463 --> 01:23:08,773
- We named him Antonio.
- Antonio, like Papà.

1077
01:23:08,983 --> 01:23:11,622
- May l hold him?
- Why not?

1078
01:23:12,783 --> 01:23:18,221
Antonio.
What a lovely baby! Antonio!

1079
01:23:19,383 --> 01:23:22,420
Move!
Get the lead outta your legs!

1080
01:23:22,903 --> 01:23:24,382
Pure lead!

1081
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:32,780
Don't make me use gloves
just before the fight.

1082
01:23:32,943 --> 01:23:35,377
l know what's best.

1083
01:23:35,823 --> 01:23:38,417
l can't get him to understand
what he's up against.

1084
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:42,417
- Someone who hits hard.
- l told him.

1085
01:23:42,623 --> 01:23:45,854
- That's what you always say.
- This time it's true.

1086
01:23:46,223 --> 01:23:50,136
A guy's got a chance
if he's fast. But you're not.

1087
01:23:52,063 --> 01:23:55,294
Well, then it's your fault.

1088
01:23:55,543 --> 01:23:58,057
l never sparred
with anybody fast.

1089
01:23:58,343 --> 01:24:00,254
Sure, sure!

1090
01:24:02,463 --> 01:24:04,135
l'll find the right guy.

1091
01:24:05,783 --> 01:24:07,296
Put some gloves on.

1092
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:08,978
Come on!

1093
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:11,657
- Me?
- Yes.

1094
01:24:11,823 --> 01:24:14,781
- Very funny.
- Let him try.

1095
01:24:14,943 --> 01:24:18,492
Yeah,
try staying on his feet tomorrow!

1096
01:24:18,703 --> 01:24:20,739
Put some gloves on!

1097
01:24:21,023 --> 01:24:23,617
Jab! Left! Left!

1098
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:31,702
Look,
l'm up against clowns!

1099
01:24:36,343 --> 01:24:38,937
Sacks of potatoes,
that's all they are!

1100
01:24:40,343 --> 01:24:42,937
We'll be a laughingstock tomorrow.
Shitheads!

1101
01:24:43,383 --> 01:24:45,613
What a brainless bunch.

1102
01:24:48,263 --> 01:24:49,696
l'm through!

1103
01:24:49,863 --> 01:24:51,694
l've had it!

1104
01:24:51,943 --> 01:24:54,332
l want real boxers,
who care!

1105
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:57,342
You're clodhoppers!
These Milanese are right.

1106
01:24:57,543 --> 01:25:00,011
Dirt-pushers. l can do without you!

1107
01:25:00,223 --> 01:25:02,179
Hey, come take a look, come on.

1108
01:25:02,343 --> 01:25:03,856
- Cerri!
- What's up?

1109
01:25:04,023 --> 01:25:07,618
- Come and take a look.
- l don't want to see anything....

1110
01:25:09,983 --> 01:25:11,860
- Come on!
- ....nothing.

1111
01:25:12,063 --> 01:25:14,338
- Come on out, Cerri.
- No, l don't feel like it.

1112
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:18,895
- lt's worth it.
- What's there to see? - A real show.

1113
01:25:25,183 --> 01:25:26,741
See that?
Ain't it wonderful?

1114
01:25:26,903 --> 01:25:28,541
He woke up.

1115
01:25:29,463 --> 01:25:30,418
Great!

1116
01:25:32,543 --> 01:25:36,058
Good, work him like that.
Listen to me.

1117
01:25:37,623 --> 01:25:40,820
That's it.

1118
01:25:41,463 --> 01:25:42,896
l'm coming.

1119
01:25:43,503 --> 01:25:45,494
Use your left.

1120
01:25:45,743 --> 01:25:50,021
Come on, Simone! Wake up!

1121
01:25:51,383 --> 01:25:53,692
- That kid, you know,....
- He's not bad.

1122
01:25:53,863 --> 01:25:55,694
He's not bad at all!

1123
01:25:55,943 --> 01:25:58,741
He's okay.
Look how he dodges punches.

1124
01:25:59,303 --> 01:26:00,372
Go on, get him!

1125
01:26:03,383 --> 01:26:06,978
Leave things up to me
before a fight.

1126
01:26:07,343 --> 01:26:08,617
l get nervous!

1127
01:26:09,423 --> 01:26:12,335
You get up there with Rocco.

1128
01:26:12,503 --> 01:26:14,221
Your turn, Dal Piaz!

1129
01:26:15,943 --> 01:26:17,262
Time!

1130
01:26:19,703 --> 01:26:21,261
He boxes real nice.

1131
01:26:21,423 --> 01:26:26,497
Simone, watch it,
or he'll grab your place.

1132
01:26:28,143 --> 01:26:29,400
Tomorrow, huh?
