00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,136
I'd rather not know.

190
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,111
I guess the boys
didn't tell you?

191
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,780
Tell me what?

192
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:32,283
Chemical attack at
Hauptbahnhof's been thwarted.

193
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,850
Two terrorists dead,

194
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,286
rest on the run,

195
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:36,787
your girlfriend in the wind.

196
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,324
Sorry, I-I...

197
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,193
Now you've lost me.

198
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,660
I'll make it
simple.

199
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,362
Allison was ordered
by your bosses

200
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,064
to let the attack
go forward.

201
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:50,000
She tried, she failed.

202
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:52,669
She's since disappeared.

203
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,370
Well...

204
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,005
if you're telling the truth,

205
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,874
she has been, uh, busy.

206
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:02,912
If I'm telling the truth,
you're burned, my friend.

207
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,348
You're left holding the bag.

208
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,783
How do you figure?

209
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:10,120
Allison on her way
back to Moscow

210
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:12,455
means you're no defector.

211
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:17,293
Means she's the Russian agent
we've been saying all along.

212
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:22,165
If you're telling the truth.

213
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,502
I'm good.

214
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,703
But I'm not that good.

215
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:30,172
A story with so
many moving parts

216
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,342
would've taken weeks
to dream up.

217
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,548
You know I'm right.

218
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:43,686
Hmm.

219
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,688
Say...

220
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:49,058
Let's say I do believe you.

221
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:50,559
What do you want?

222
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:53,763
I want her back.
I want her punished.

223
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,899
And what makes you think
I even know where she is

224
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,068
or how they're gonna
get her out of the country?

225
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,570
'Cause if she were
my agent, I'd know.

226
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:04,739
- Hmm.
- 'Cause I'd know everything about her.

227
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:07,909
Down to the very last detail.

228
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,346
When to scold, when to forgive.

229
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,415
When to laugh at her jokes.

230
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:17,352
Except she's the one running me.

231
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:24,059
Ivan.

232
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:26,228
I say this respectfully.

233
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:29,298
One professional
to another.

234
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:33,901

236
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:48,749

you were a ski racer.

237
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:50,418
Downhill?

238
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:52,986
Giant slalom was my event.
Why?

239
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:56,123
How does resettlement in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming sound?

240
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:58,626
Witness protection,

241
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:00,695
a sizable
living expense.

242
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,365
I'd miss the Alps.

243
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,132
You'll miss 'em either way.

244
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,901
And there's no family in the
picture, is there? Not a wife

245
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:11,605
or children?

246
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,806
So you've devoted
your entire life

247
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:17,977
to an institution that's now
turning its back on you.

248
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,312

249
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,281

What's so amusing?

254
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:31,291
Nothing, nothing.

255
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:34,628
It's a good pitch you're making.

256
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:36,963
I'm... I'm admiring it.

257
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:46,038
I was gonna tell you
it's not for nothing.

258
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:47,673
- No?
- No.

259
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:48,875

This close.

263
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:59,385
And not many people
can say that.

264
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:07,193
But I won't
be making you another offer

you wouldn't see
other things so clearly.

373
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:20,807
Oh, thankfully, "quack" is the
same in English as in German.

374
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,108
Lucky for you.

375
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:25,811
Mm-hmm. Lucky for me.

376
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:30,482
(sighs)

377
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:33,485
I wanted to take some of
Franny's books back with me.

378
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,356
The danger's over then?

379
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:40,826
You're safe from what
you've been running from?

380
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:46,564
Yes, I'm safe.

381
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:49,334
We're safe.

382
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,872
You want to tell me
what happened today?

383
00:24:56,242 --> 00:24:57,676
It's all over
the-the Internet.

384
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:59,678
A mysterious blonde woman

385
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:02,847
in the Hauptbahnhof
tunnels with a gun.

386
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:09,153
You?

387
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:19,831
Me.

388
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,880
Nice shirt.

389
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:43,220
Take it. It's yours.

390
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:48,558
It'll make me happy
knowing you're wearing it.

391
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:59,435
So that's it?

392
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:02,638
We're just... we're just
gonna say good-bye

393
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:04,941
like none of this ever happened?

394
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:06,743
It happened.

395
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:10,380
I was happy here.

396
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:12,882
Franny was happy.
I think you were, too.

397
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:15,117
Yeah, I was.

398
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:17,219
So why can't we just pick up
where we left off?

399
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:18,721
Would that be so hard?

400
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:21,056
- Come here, sit back down.
- No.

401
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:22,558
I don't...
I don't want to sit down.

402
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,894
No, I-I want another chance.
I think we could do better

403
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:27,263
this time.

404
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:31,768
Look, I'm sorry.

405
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:33,235
You're sorry?

406
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:35,070
This is not easy
for me, either.

407
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:37,973
I love you guys. I really do.

408
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,575
Then don't break up with us.

409
00:26:39,643 --> 00:26:42,278
Let's just put everything
back the way it was.

410
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:44,013
Maybe you can't put
things back, eh?

411
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,781
- They won't go back.
- You don't know that.

412
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:47,950
You don't know that
until we've tried.

413
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:49,484
I can't unhear things
I've heard,

414
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:51,453
unsee things I've seen.
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:52,721
Stop saying that.

416
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:54,123
- Stop saying that you're sorry.
- Look, look...

417
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,624
I don't want to go
through life always worried

418
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:57,326
about what's around
the next corner.

419
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:59,461
And I don't want
my kids to, either.

420
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:04,300
- Your kids?
- Yeah.

421
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,302
What happened to Steffan
can never happen again.

422
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,271
- It won't.
- You can't promise me that.

423
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:10,906
- Jonas...
- Carrie, I'm doing us both a favor.

424
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:12,908
Can't you see?

425
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:15,844
It will never work
is what I'm saying.

426
00:27:15,912 --> 00:27:19,180
It was a crazy idea
to begin with.

427
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:21,817
Oh, so now I'm crazy?

428
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:24,018
- I didn't say that.
- I'm not crazy, Jonas.

429
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:25,620
- No.
- I went off my meds for a reason.

430
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:27,355
- I know.
- (scoffs)

431
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,125
No. No, you know what was crazy?

432
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:33,361
Was that I actually
opened myself up to you

433
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:34,863
and really
let you in.

434
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,498
We are not talking
about the same thing.

435
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:39,801
I'm talking about loving you,
about being loved.

436
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:41,169
What are you talking about?

437
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:43,705
Hey. Hey, come on.

438
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:45,305
No, no, no. No,
I don't want that.

439
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,974
I don't want it.
I won't allow it.

440
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:15,869
No.

441
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:18,371
No, no.

442
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,074
Peter Quinn--
he was in Room 303.

443
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:23,743
He's not there.
Where is he?

444
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:25,177
- Are you his wife?
- No.

445
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,346
- Family?
- I am a friend, goddamn it! Where is he?

446
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,848
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to calm down.

447
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,416
He's in the OR.

448
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,851
He had a brain hemorrhage.

449
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,021
The neurosurgical team
is operating on him now.

450
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,090
What, so he had a stroke?

451
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:41,027
In his case,
intracerebral and quite severe.

452
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,529
How long has he been in surgery?

453
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:47,033
A couple of hours now, but
he's gonna be in there a while.

454
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,600
Five or six hours at least.

455
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:51,904
Can I show you to
the waiting room?

456
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:54,540
The chapel.

457
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,741
Is there a chapel?

458
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:57,076
Yeah.

459
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,734
(sighs)

460
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:33,143

(soft groaning and gasping)

472
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:40,342
Hello.

473
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:42,711
I'm sorry.
I've-I've forgotten your name.

474
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,013
- I'm Dr. Emory.
- I remember.

475
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,848
- I'm Carrie.
- Oh.

476
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:49,183
- May I join you, Carrie?
- Of course.

477
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:53,354
So, he's out of surgery.

478
00:30:53,421 --> 00:30:55,422
But the hematoma
was very large.

479
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,892
We had to perform a
craniotomy, drain it

480
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,527
and repair the bleed.

481
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:01,428
What does that mean?
Will he recover?

482
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:04,365
Well, it's too soon to tell.

483
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:05,767
Come on, Doctor.

484
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,202
You've seen a thousand
of these. You know.

485
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,838
Tell me.

486
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:12,506
It was a bad one.

487
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:14,508
And even if he does recover,

488
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:17,211
the brain damage
will be significant.

489
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:22,849
- Where is he?
- He's in post-op.

490
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,851
I need to see him.

491
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,887
Oh, of course.

492
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:29,356
(indistinct chatter)

493
00:31:43,304 --> 00:31:45,738
(rhythmic beeping and whooshing)

494
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:06,826
Oh, dear God.

495
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:10,396
- (panting)
- You all right?

496
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,801
Did we do this to him?

497
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,238
(crying)

498
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:31,559
_

♪

500
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,611
(beep)

501
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:05,783
Good morning.

502
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:13,091
I was beginning to think
you'd forgotten about me.

503
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,894
(sighs)

504
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,262
I'm going to tell you
three things.

505
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,065
All true.

506
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,266
(scoffs)

507
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,736
If you say so.

508
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,507
One-- Faisal Marwan is dead.

509
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,944
He threw himself out
a fifth story window

510
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,278
right here in this building.

511
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,282
You mean you threw him
out the window.

512
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,784
He jumped.

513
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,451
That is a fact.

514
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,287
You killed him.

515
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:47,523
You fuckers.

516
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:48,858
No.

517
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,793
We made a mistake
leaving him alone,

518
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:53,963
but we did not kill him.

519
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,132
Still, that presents us
with a problem.

520
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:59,669
How to explain his death
to the German people.

521
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:00,737
No shit.

522
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:02,505
Which brings me
to the second thing.

523
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:04,406
Your friend Numan.

524
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:08,044
What about him?

525
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,679
He's in the next cell.

526
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,848
We have his laptop.

527
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:15,151
We've recovered
the hacked documents.

528
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:16,785
Since now they'll
never be published,

529
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:18,154
you've lost your leverage.

530
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:23,025
(sighs)

531
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:24,293
I'm happy to show him to you

532
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,295
if you don't believe me.

533
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:31,200
You people.

534
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:34,170
You're the one who's abused
your position here in Germany.

535
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:36,172
Yeah?

536
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,075
So why am I not on a plane home
like you said?

537
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:42,178
What am I still doing here?

538
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:45,513
Believe me, there are
plenty of my colleagues

539
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:47,848
not far from where we're sitting
who'd like nothing better than

540
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,850
to see you rot
in a supermax prison.

541
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,586
You think I care
what you do to me?

542
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:53,721
Ah.

543
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:58,893
But you are not the one
we're talking about, are you?

544
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,863
It's Numan.

545
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,901
What do you mean?

546
00:35:06,968 --> 00:35:10,338
His asylum status here
was granted

547
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:12,340
on a temporary basis only.

548
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:14,509
Up for review

549
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:16,877
every six months.

550
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:21,516

00:47:58,887 --> 00:48:00,655
I'd like to make one.

733
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:02,823
I can't go back to work
right away, Otto.

734
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:04,692
I'm sorry.

735
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,993
Too much has happened.

736
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:09,664
I need to take some time,
be a mom again for a while.

737
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:12,332
Understand.

738
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,101
But I'm not talking
about your old job.

739
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:15,602
No?

740
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:18,139
No. You've trained
your team well.

741
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:19,774
Mike can take over.

742
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:22,108
What then?

743
00:48:22,177 --> 00:48:25,312
Over the years, I've hired
a lot of extraordinary people,

744
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,980
interviewed a lot more.

745
00:48:27,048 --> 00:48:28,649
Well, you're picky.

746
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:30,384
(chuckling):
You're famous for it.

747
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:33,153
Never anybody like you, though.

748
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:36,022
That's nice of you to say.

749
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,892
It's not nice.

750
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,561
I read your application,

751
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:42,162
saw right away
how brilliant you are,

752
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:45,399
what a freethinker,

753
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:47,167
and insisted on meeting you.

754
00:48:47,235 --> 00:48:48,835
I remember.

755
00:48:48,903 --> 00:48:53,706
We sat down at 10:15
on a Wednesday morning.

756
00:48:53,773 --> 00:48:56,909
I offered you the
position at 10:30.

757
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:59,679
I remember.

758
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:04,617
I was waiting for you, Carrie.

759
00:49:04,685 --> 00:49:07,753
I was waiting for you
to walk through the door.

760
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:13,157
Okay, now I'm a little lost.

761
00:49:13,226 --> 00:49:15,993
I want a partner,

762
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:18,830
someone who knows the world
for what it is

763
00:49:18,897 --> 00:49:20,699
but also knows
it must be made better.

764
00:49:20,766 --> 00:49:23,368
Someone to share
my life with.

765
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:27,872
Otto...

766
00:49:36,282 --> 00:49:38,250
You don't have
to answer now.

767
00:49:38,317 --> 00:49:40,252
Go back to America.

768
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,787
Spend time with your daughter.

769
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,456
Think about it.

770
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:49,727
I-I don't know what to say.

771
00:49:49,795 --> 00:49:51,229
Say nothing.

772
00:49:51,296 --> 00:49:55,399
Just think about the scope
and scale of what I'm proposing.

773
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:57,468
The possibilities.

774
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:02,439
I'll be in Washington
next month for meetings.

775
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,448
We can talk then.

Hello.

Laura, what's going on?

They just let me go.

Numan, I can't talk to you.

781
00:50:40,611 --> 00:50:42,378
What do you mean, you can't
talk to me? Why not?

782
00:50:42,446 --> 00:50:45,348
It's a condition
of the deal I made.

783
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,017
I can't talk to you ever again.

784
00:50:47,084 --> 00:50:49,019
What deal?

785
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:52,555
Good-bye.
