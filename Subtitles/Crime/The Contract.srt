00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,306
but if he/she has to miscarry... or if we fail the objective.
- We won't fail

26
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,907
Do you have the intention of failing?

27
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,068
Me not. But I cannot guarantee
that the others don't fail.

28
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,385
I can.

29
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,028
We will travel for companies
aerial different.

30
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,186

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,463
Apposed that is going in the 1..

Well and everything.

34
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,988
Ahhh, I don't believe.

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,140
Anything, father, what wants

43
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,540
He/she begins with...
Excuses.

44
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,299
To ask excuse to who?
- To your companions of it equips, to me.

45
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,545
You have luck of you remove yourself
just with 3 days of suspension

46
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,224
- Luck!
Yes, luck.

47
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,625
Father, I don't understand this whole cry.
Nowadays everyone smokes herb.

48
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,184
Don't come me with shit
Do I seem you some idiot?

49
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,223
You know that don't matter
with the one that the others do, you are my son.

50
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,382
I know about the one that and,
and on your mother.

51
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,903
Or that.

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,266
Chris, I will only speak...
- Ok, will already finish with this.

53
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,620
Does he/she tell me, everything the one what I make this wandered, ok?

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,344
Chris, I am only to try to say...
- Then for of trying to help me.

55
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,063
And for of using that stupid bracelet,
as if it was to do some difference

56
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,467
You cannot make anything.

57
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,386
Why do pretend that you can make something?
You are not able to.

58
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,861
Everything was not well, father.

59
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,578
When she was sick said
that was everything well and no, no...

60
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,504
he/she was not.

61
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,259

62
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,983
Of a peep in this.

63
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,427
I have better pictures of the
that these, Mr. Hammond.

64
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,666
Do you know him/it what this means?
- Did my wife hire him?

65
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,064
Naturally, you know.

66
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,463
Who do you know and my father?
- Therefore and that are to speak with itself.

67
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,501
I calculated that maybe were able to
to do a better one negotiates.

68
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,700
How much and what will this cost me?
- Well...

69
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,422
Will we arrive late the school?

70
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,027
He/she throws the ball that I still win you.
- Do you win me?

71
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,188
He/she hears, I thought that
we could make something together.

72
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,142
Something what like to do?

73
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,787
He/she polices took me to her everything, father.

74
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,901
Haul of that, well, you know...

75
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,528
And that such to camp.

76
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,500
Do you like to camp?

77
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,499
-Is it later? You like.

78
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,978
What and what do find?

79
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,187
I don't think are to speak to her serialize.

80
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,779
Then, what makes in the life, Mr. Ellwood?

81
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,982
I sell equipments informaticos.
Outlying

82
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,465
They are not the computers.
Plus the things than they accompany them.

83
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,583
You know, cables, softwares. Systems
of storage of data, things like this.

84
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,106
I am afraid not to be of his/her interest.
- No, and fascinating.

85
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,907
Here this, Mr. Ellwood.

86
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,698
The light bill this included.
The income and he/she pays in the 1° day of the month.

87
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,901
Very well, thank you.
- You can use the garage.

88
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,669
He/she has a lock electronica.

89
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,545
The garbage Mondays and Thursdays...
- Thank you very much.

90
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,380
The first phase was executed.
- Without problems?

91
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,103
Correcto.
- Fortunately.

92
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,062
We are going to the second phase.

93
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,061
Don't speak anything to her.

94
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,067
She wanted to give me number him/it of the
call of her.

95
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,660
I told him/her, it excuses me dear.
I have a great girlfriend.

96
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,428
She sat down there.

97
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,069
Did he/she see this?

98
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,982
Car accident?
- Correcto.

99
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,189
Does he/she have more some?
- No. The second was a pile of ashes.

100
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,188
Him this stable one.
- Did he say something even so?

101
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,858
No, him this out of itself.
- Right.

102
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,468
-Call the safety.

103
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,830
How and what if this to feel?
My name and Wainwright.

104
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,703
Ed Wainwright, Boss of it Polices.

105
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,582
Go there,
the man came directamente upward of me.

106
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,099
Yes, I am the sure that yes.
No and that.

107
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,542
The weapon?

108
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,822
We did vary researches.

109
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,988
I tried to enter in contact
with somebody close, of Robert Ellwood.

110
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,899
He/she seems that he doesn't have anybody
And he died when he/she was 3 years old.

111
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,780
We examined ourselves their fingerprints,
Mr. Carden.

112
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,304
You this classified, as one
missing soldier has many years.

113
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,308
But you no longer this disappeared,
Mr. Carden.

114
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,259
You know, they don't appear a lot of people
of his/her type in our small city.

115
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,582
You know, frankly, Frank,
I cannot think about anything, though...

116
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,348
Ei, frankly, Frank,
this and a game of words.

117
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,461
No, and a pun,
no a game.

118
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,343
Yes, in every case...
then, and Frank...

119
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,229
...What and what this to do here?
- When and what will come for my cause?

120
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,470
I will put two men here
during the whole night.

121
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,786
Only for itself, Mr. Carden.

122
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,589
Very open eyes. I will be back of guile.
- Right.

123
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,029
That ray and he/she happened that is not able to
to wait an hour and a half.

124
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,298
It polices her/it in the northwest of the state.
It picked this man in a car accident.

125
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,228
And better than this is good.

126
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,182
I examined the fingerprints
of him, in the bases of data.

127
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,178
I found a such of Major
Frank Carden in the military files.

128
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,301
Frank Carden?
- Does he/she know him/it?

129
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:41,302
- No.

130
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,704
He/she served in the service of information
missing in combat in 1974.

131
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,947
I suppose that he/she didn't die in the accident.
- No, no, this in the hospital.

132
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,106
Somebody called the Department
of National security.

133
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,141
In FBI all are animated with this.

134
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,420
The another negotiate are already behind us.

135
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,020
This subjects and a hot potato.
- Do I serialize her?

136
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,782
He/she seems that nowadays all want
to tie the alarm system.

137
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,978
Everything well, find out when he arrives.
- With certainty.

138
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,458
It ties soon.

139
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,424
Yes.
- Miles.

140
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,224
What did happen he/she? And him?
- Yes, without you doubt and Carden.

141
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,819
An agent of FBI ended now
of telling me this.

142
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,259
I don't want this to go far away.
- No, gentleman.

143
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,785
He/she had not escaped us from the hand gentleman,
I am on top of the subject.

144
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,700
How and what does that know?

145
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:42,701
- He tied me.
- Did he/she tie him/her?

146
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,185
How and what did he get to do that?
- He/she asks him/her later.

147
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,860
- We will have to improvise.
- Ok, rule 1: we won't go back to have saved him/it.

148
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,389
Him this hurt, he will be like this...

149
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,182
He would make the same thing
regarding us.

150
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,779
He/she doesn't know him/it that this to say!
-The old let to be hit, problem of him.

151
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,902
Frank this in the command.
We are us with him there is a long time.

152
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,021
Yes, all less you.
-Some time heard to talk about loyalty?

153
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,984
Yes, I read once on that in a book.
Me I am not paid to save him/her the tail.

154
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,863
He/she had not received anything...
Unless it saves him/her the tail.

155
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,062
He/she knows that bill out of the parents
Only Frank has access to her.

156
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,738
Without Frank, any money.

157
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,182
That argument appeals
to my emotional side.

158
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,587
Local celebrities and Vip's
they are to do a lobby

159
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,065
for us to have dinner with the president.

160
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,421
after his/her speech in the university...

161
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,543
Good morning.
- Good morning.

162
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,105
Another announce, we were informed on
famous Lydel Hammond Jr,

163
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,666
It was involved in an accident
of running over and escape

164
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,861
out of the city

165
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,867
Will we make really this?

166
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,902
No, I propose that drink the coffee

But it could be.
- It is true but no and

I didn't say that.
I tried but I didn't like.

196
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,621
I didn't like the way as the people are.
They seem stupid.

197
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,821
The herb makes to seem stupid
and it reduces you QI.

198
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,863
Then you smoked more than I.
- Very funny.

I don't like to read
while I watch a film.

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,983
You become used to.

203
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,067
For you and easy.
You speak Spanish.

204
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,547
No so well,
I stopped reading the legends.

205
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,340
He/she admits, you don't simply want
to see a film in foreign language.

206
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,620
Yes, I, simply only want to see.

207
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,060
If you want to read, I buy a book.

208
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,385
Do Christ, help him/it?

209
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,307
Ei, you this to block the highway.

211
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,424
He/she will sand you!

212
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,780
You are the sure that there is no alternative
for us to receive the money?

213
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,743
You and Davis go down.
Royko, liberates you of this.

214
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,148
I thought that these old bridges
they were built

215
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,183
over deep channels and you are worth.

216
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,901
You have been watching many films in TV.

217
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,226
Yes. Do you remember the "Crocodilo Dundee?"

218
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,864
There was an elephant
and he crossed...

219
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,220
Chris.
- What?

220
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,865
Come.

221
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,146
Help me!

222
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,146

it keeps an eye out for him.
My weapon.

226
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,783
He/she calls the service of the emergency.
Don't let to flee him.

227
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,062
Don't let to flee him.

228
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,109
Mister?

229
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,502
And a waste of time.

230
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,019
Does Carden have nine lives, did you know?

231
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,300
Can you point that thing for another place?

232
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,905
Chris.

233
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,459
Chris!

234
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,138
He/she already diffuses in your telephone
and league for the emergencies.

235
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,222
Be oh, gentleman.
Don't approach, don't approach.

236
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,749
He/she doesn't have net.

237
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,909
We will accompany this man ties the main street
there the telephone will work.

238
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,023
And what will do.
- Listen, it will be more intelligent if he/she lets to leave.

239
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,346
If it tries to take me,
both will die.

240
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,984
How?
-My men are me to proceed.

241
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,148

Be here during one hour
and later go home.

245
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,066
And the best choice.
And the only choice.

246
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,108
Father, he is right.
Let to go him.

247
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,870
We have ourselves the weapon.
He won't make anything. He/she lets to go him.

248
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,344
He/she lets to think me.

Him and Ray.
- Ray.

253
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,340
You one don't want to see involved in this.

254
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,547
This goes for they haul of his/her capacity.

255
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,700
He/she said a wrong thing.
- What?

256
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,946
Now he will make that.

257
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,066
We will arise ties the main street.
Chris, you are behind me.

258
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,225
You, you had been my front
the whole road.

259
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,629
Good, we go.

260
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,058
Let us go.

261
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,064
Go.

262
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,229
Oh, My God.

263
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,579
Despachador...

264
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,270
Candidate disappeared.
- We will arrange other.

265
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,780
No and probable that he works alone.
- Of where and what did remove that idea?

266
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,379
We will eat lunch.
He/she tries to discover something.

267
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,148
Chris, gives me the telephone.

268
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,103
Continue to walk.

269
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,378
Fabulous.

270
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,740
I told you, and the end.

271
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,507
Carden still this sat down in the car...
...under it longs for.

272
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,984
Maybe.

273
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,865
Maybe?

274
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,069
Maybe not.

275
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,580
Three people were here.

276
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,105
One of them and woman,
maybe it is a child.

277
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,299
Balls, I hate mountaineering.

278
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,222
Father, we are close,
the parking and already there.

279
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,265
Chris, is going the front.

280
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,347
They have an I radiate and he/she asks them
to call her it polices.

281
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,586
Simply tell them that happened.
- That no and a good idea.

282
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,860
I didn't ask his/her opinion. Go.

283
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,263
He/she is going the front.

284
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,704
A car was misled the river close to
approximately to 800 meters of here.

285
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,346
That sounds badly.
- The current brought him/it, maybe have somebody inside.

286
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,382
If they help me, we will there be able to go.

287
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,660
And only the one measures in kilometers the jusante of here.

288
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,140
Did you communicate this?
- Yes, I communicated.

289
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,379
Chris?

290
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,220
Father!
- Father, they killed him/it!

291
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,022
They killed him/it, in the parking.
They killed him/it!

292
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,061
Chris, breathes bottom.
What did happen he/she?

293
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,784
Where and what him this now?
- They left.

294
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,345
Certainly they are close give.
- No this nobody here.

295
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,984
Wait, they must arrive oh.

296
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,663
And better.

297
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,305
Are you the sure of that?

298
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,468
It could be anybody, a couple of...
...homosexuals, lovers of the nature...

299
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,545
In the river? They are them.

300
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,901
I told him/her that this goes for there
of his/her capacity.

301
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,782
Well, he/she lets to think me.

302
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,626
We go there upward...

303
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,743
Are they their friends?

304
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,223
Well...

305
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,499
We are leaving in that direccao.

306
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,107
We go, in front.

307
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,422
Father, where and are we to go?
- We go for here.

308
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,827
Fast!
Faster.

309
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,662
They never arrived at the airport.
- Yes, that and what was me informed.

310
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,981
Do you think were them?

311
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,865
It could be.

312
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,743
And unlikely that have stopped
to eat and to drink.

313
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,344
What and what did make with them?

314
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,780
Where and what this Carden?
- He didn't arrive here.

315
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,140
He/she said that were three in the road.
- Yes, they were

316
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,306
They must have left the highway.

317
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,828
They must have seen us.

318
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,428
Concadin
he/she found some thing.

319
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,101
They went over there.
-He bring longs for, no and an explorer.

320
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,266
They were really here.
Didn't you see them?

321
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,825
Leave me alone, Davis.
-Balls, because and that he/she doesn't open the eyes.

322
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,145
We have ourselves a problem.
- Remain silent!

323
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,904
The driver of the carrinha communicated the accident,
We will have company.

324
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,385
This done the asneirada,
we should begin to walk

325
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,945
We have ourselves the day of payment to arrive.
- Yes.

326
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,266
They won't be very far.
We are going behind them.

327
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,700
Get rid of the carrinha.
- I make him/it.

328
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,344
Because?

329
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,263
I like to drive.

330
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,909
Does so much do?

331
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,820
Go.

332
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,224
Does it think will see him/it again?
- And who cares except we come him?

333
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,739
His greed will put upon to the rest.

334
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,783
I suppose that that means that
does he only want money, right?

335
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,787
Right. Let us go.

336
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,390
Faster, Chris.
In front.

337
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,184
Move.

00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,423
And you, Davis?
- Yes, they walk the search of Carden.

339
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,144
Can you speak?
- Get rid of Carden.

340
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,659
What?
- Yes, he has to die, he/she noticed.

341
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,987
Can you make this?
- And possible, but no and easy.

342
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,068
Half million?
- How much?

343
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,340
You heard, half million.

344
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,980
Now he/she called me the attention.
Everything well.

345
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,261
Chris, this doesn't seem good.

346
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,827
Do you already know where go?
- Yes.

347
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,780
Of there part the navigation competition.

- Yes.

349

00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,827
He/she has a road cuts near fire.

351
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,221
Yes, I arrived there first, before all.

352
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,389
Hear, leave me here
and go straight ahead.

353
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,621
They will find me
and you will already have missing person.

354
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,019
No!

355
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,267
Father, you know what happened
in the parking?

356
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,018
They followed us and later...
- Yes, I know.

357
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,468
For our safety, you had been connosco.

358
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,819
Move.

359
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,425
How and what do you call her in any way?
- Carden, my name and Frank Carden.

360
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,382
I am really penitent
of having acquaintance.

361
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,065
Still no...
not yet.

362
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,508
We have a corpse, boss here.
And Danfield.

363
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,779
Done drown?

364
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,899
Drowned, they gave him/her a shot,
the legs broken choice.

365
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,138
I have a bad premonition that
his/her son this lost, Ray.

366
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,829
We are not lost.

367
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,029
We have to return.

368
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,186
Father, I didn't get lost.
We can go down ourselves of here.

369
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,824
Chris, we are not able to us, this and impossible.
- Father, really.

370
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,339
Don't discuss with me, Chris!
- Really, father, hear...

371
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,662
...Hear me at least once.
- Aggressive boy, Ray.

372
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,701
A road exists, you don't know him/it.
Me yes, right?

373
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,743
We are leaving in the trip.
Here this. And exactamente here.

374
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,340
Did he/she make this in the rain?
- No, but it was easy.

375
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,348
Once we begin
there are rifts in the rocks the feet and hands.

376
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,623
Well but it was tied to a rope.
And did he/she have an instructor, right?

377
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,266
Yes, but I am right that
we are capable to do this.

378
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,742
If he/she has the desire to die,

379
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,339
I know in a less painful way, Ray.

380
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,789
We will try.

381
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,466
I am not able to with these handcuffs.

382
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,865
If he/she tries to do some thing,
I will be behind...

383
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,186
And interest for God that I push you of the cliff.

384
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,950
What and what you and, does one police?

386
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,302
Slowly, Chris, slowly!

387
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,425
Chris, this everything well?
- Yes.

388
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,869

389
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,509
See, there in low!

390
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,938
Didn't they return?

391
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,823
No, or else we had seen them.
They went down.

392
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,102
I don't see as.

393
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,543
Right. I help him/it, I help him/it.

394
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,943
Is there a grotto there?

395
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,824
Ok.

396
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,149

He/she calms, Calm.

404
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,344
Let us go.

405
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,145
Hold him/it, Chris, hold him/it.
He already caught you.

406
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,103
Ok.

407
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,701
Do Chris, help me? Fast!

408
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,858
Stop! They can stop!

409
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,068
Release my father.

410
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,943
Feel the weapon.

411
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,905
No.

412
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,383
Any track of Gardner?

413
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,866
No, only of the two agents.
A still this inside.

414
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,182
Yes. Well, thank you.

415
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,386
Who and that such of Gardner?

416
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,378
Everything that I know and that him and a lot
important for the people of the capital.

417
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,548
Does he/she think him and a terrorist?
- No, I doubt.

418
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,581
He seems a normal person.

419
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:41,180
Yes, but those types also
they seem normal, as well as us.

420
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,383
To me, maybe,
but no as normal as you.

421
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,306
I will tell him/her a thing.
- What?

422
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,468
If we take advantage istos,
our pictures will appear in the newspapers.

423
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,467
An enlarged plan of the car.

424
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,625
It is then pass for a closed plan.

425
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,423

Ok.

428
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,989
He/she has to carry well
I won't return them to remove again.

429
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,460
I cannot blame myself of
to have tried this.

430
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,858
You have a lot of fork for an old one.

431
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,586
Training soldierly.

432
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,390
Which and does yours recount?
Because and what do they want him/it?

433
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,944
They picked me to smoke at a restaurant.

434
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,983
They consider that a lot a thing
it would be nowadays, he/she knows.

435
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,186
Who are the people behind us?

436
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,268
Friends.
They are not their friends.

437
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,666
Then you and a physical education teacher?

438
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,780
Yes.

439
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,782
It is also trains basebol and basket in the Winter.
- Truth?

440
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,668
I adore basebol.

441
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,627
Then, what did you make exactamente, gentleman?
Honestly.

442
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,348
I am an exterminator.

443
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,627
Exterminator? How? Termites?

444
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,188
No totally.

445
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,223
I am contracted to eliminate...

446
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,586
We called this of...
...To eliminate obstacles to the progress.

447
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,781
Obstacles to the progress.

448
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,625
Then and simply a mercenary?

449
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,708
Who doesn't import he/she exterminates?

450
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,826
Without limits.
I still didn't find none.

451
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,260
Him this to speak to her serializes, no and, father?
- No, him this to say nonsenses.

452
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,940
I picked him/it to lie.

453
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,029
I don't know...
He avoided that I fell.

454
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,307
It was simply a reflex.

455
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,421
No and I need to be sentimental with that.

456
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,746
I won't be sentimental with that.

457
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,259
I think I know than and capable.

458
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,667
A stop for a picnic.

459
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,988
No, we lost their track.

460
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,987
Is he/she the sure that you/they passed for here?

461
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,738
Without he/she doubts that I am sure.

462
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,420
Tomorrow all police them of the state
they will be here.

463
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,986
He/she polices federal and that treta.
They will roll all of the stones to meet.

464
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,750
Which and the problem, Royko?
Do you want to give up?

465
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,259
I don't know, I don't know.

466
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,545

All know ourselves what wants to do.

469
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,540
I think should continue.
We go find them.

470
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,742
That and a change, Davis.
What does happen he/she?

471
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,942
Delicious and extensive money.

00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,506
And that.
We will give him/her an opportunity.

473
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,303
Of picking the track tomorrow.

00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,587
Gwen Miles.

478
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,225
Does he/she already have some thing for us?

479
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,018
my boys found tracks.
- What species of tracks?

480
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:52,621
Three people that left the river.
Where Stanfield was found.

481
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,265
Carden?
- Possibly.

482
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,501
And the other ones two.

483
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,705
I forgot about my crystal ball.
- Thank you, sergeant.

484
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,500
Gentlemen, the place of the crime and of FBI.
Thank you.

485
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,270
What? - If and this what the one wants?
- This and what wants.

486
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,938
The federal ones will treat of the search.

487
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,625
Then only they leave us the work of 
go look for coffee.

488
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,108
It will be fabulous if you got some.
Double express, without sugar.

489
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,346
Two.

490
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,509
FBI.

491
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,187
Don't that say loud?
Or else they will be to think that are an idiot.

492
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,990
Chris, wakes up. Chris?

493
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,790
Let to sleep him.

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,740
I am with cramps.
- I am sad with this, Frank.

496
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,062
Did he/she drink the coffee of the guile?

497
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,705
What does think this about Hilton?

498
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,461
I told him/her that he/she doesn't make sense to return here.
They turned off the track.

499
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,501
Would not he/she find them?
- Maybe not.

500
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,019
Jesus, if it was not the picnic, 
they would be already in our hands.

501
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,506
Because and what do find that?
- Because I would not lose them.

502
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,590
Can I shoot in him?
- Not yet.

503
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,628
Ei, Davis, no there is none
competition here.

504
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,547
You would not have any hypothesis.

505
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,947
Balls. They slept here.

506
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,229
They went down of here.

507
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,940
Carden can be
anywhere.

508
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,179
It also ties to be dead.

509
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:53,224
Don't have illusions in relation to Frank Carden.
- Why not?

510
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,308
They don't pretend to be always correctos.
- What does have that?

511
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,783
Don't you know him/it, yes?

512
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,458
Personal files of him.
- And?

513
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,706
The Service of Military Information protects him/it.

514
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,982
I eat like this, a murderer...
- He didn't give pizzas.

515
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,589
Without expressed.

516
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,905
Sugar.

517
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,825
Milk.

518
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,584
Repugnant?
- Repugnant.

519
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,620
Donuts?
- No.

520
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,784
Thank you.

521
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,986
Pardon.
- Come La.

522
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,819
What does the one know and more deplorable in this everything?
- What?

523
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,939
Clue Costa Leste,
the coffee no this good one and only sugar.

524
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,782
Then, why and what the carden this here?

525
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,865
The President of the United States 
Woodburn arrives tomorrow.

526
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,709
He/she thinks the President and the objective.
- Maybe.

527
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,343
Because not?

528
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:58,103
Good, then they want to kill the President.
-These to play?

529
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,747
He/she continues, Chris.
They will return, don't worry.

530
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,384
They didn't count with that.
- Because not?

531
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,663
My men already notice his/her mistake.
They should not be very far away from us.

532
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,702
One of them and a professional explorer 
he/she trained the aborigenes of Australia.

533
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,946
Frank.
- Do you know these native ones?

534
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,418
Frank, remain silent.

535
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,384
Do you play chess in one moment of these?
- I have to win this.

536
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,188
Women's game.

537
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,024
Finally we agreed 
with some thing, Davis.

538
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,027
We leave.
- He/she calms, we go pick us them.

539
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,745
A thing and right. Frank will find
the means for delaying.

540
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:50,587
Is there how long and teacher?
- There are no many years.

541
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,339
It should be good in that.
- More or less, I find.

542
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:56,059
This and truth, Chris?

543
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,819
He thinks that yes, him and very demanding.
- We will stop.

544
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:03,463
Wait for a little.
Water.

545
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,181
Do you want?
- Yes.

546
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,146
Did his/her wife die from cancer?

547
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:32,949
Yes.
Two years ago.

548
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,464
I feel a lot.

549
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:47,509
Do I serialize her? And difficult to believe in that.
I don't know because.

550
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,544
Because?
Because of my profession?

551
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:52,825
Maybe.

552
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,065
Chris.

553
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,109
Receive medals for the 
does my work, believe in that?

554
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:06,029
Now? 
- No, now with the politically correcto.

555
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,220
And better to have a smaller profile.

556
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,986
The heroes are old-fashioned.

557
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,986
This to say that and a spy?

558
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:16,579
You and a soldier to work for CIA,
no and that?

559
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,066
In the past, now not.
- No.

560
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,663
For who he/she does work?

561
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:25,065
I sincerely don't know, Ray.

562
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:30,344
Special groups, people with a calendar,
people that have money for such.

563
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,706
And to you he/she doesn't worry about anything, right?

564
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:37,461
In the course of time you will understand that.
...some subjects are very complicated.

565
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,706
Naturally.
- The one that and certain, which and wrong.

566
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,108
However, you simply 
he/she tries to do his/her work.

567
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,782
And you make the best than it can,
as well as everyone.

568
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,986
Ok, and best go walking.

569
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,266
And very late for me to change.

570
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,700
What and what can I make?

571
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,787
I don't know, Frank.
We are going ahead.

572
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,106
In front.
- Broker of safe?

573
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,182
I don't care, Frank.

574
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,589
Maybe study again and obtain him/it 
my diploma.

575
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,705
Ei, what and what these to do?

576
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,622
I grew and I saw...
- Can we get more helicopters?

577
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:31,419
I already made the request. No and like this so simple,
Mr. Jennings.

578
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,860
Here no and Washington DC.
This and the state of Washington.

579
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,822
That and even truth.

580
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,825
I don't believe in anything of that.
In every case we don't have to do anything with that.

581
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,702
He/she didn't also have to do anything 
connosco 24 hours ago.

582
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,502
I said that should have gone to Sao Francisco.

583
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,020
To visit your mother?
What and what did he make?

584
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,664
I don't know, but something ran badly.

585
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,462
And it comes men behind us for this road.

586
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,546
More is worth to go in that direccao.
- You go where wants.

587
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,063
And us through where want.

588
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,464
And when we come polices her will do complaint.

589
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,264
I don't want to see me involved in this.
We go, Sam.

590
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,142
I think this and a mistake.

591
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:06,779
He didn't say that those men 
they would come on that side.

592
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,821
How will we know if that and truth?

593
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,305
How will we know that no and?

594
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,903
We are us here. One exists is worth or something like that.

595
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:17,941
When they arrive there, they will be been hit.

596
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,586
Maybe exist a bridge.
- In agreement with this map, not.

597
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:25,108
Who has Carden,
he/she also knows the area, very well.

598
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,629
Or else we had already picked them.

599
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,185
We have to think in something fast,
or else we lost them.

600
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:30,869
Then, what suggests?

601
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,140
Whose was the idea of go camp?

602
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:37,059
Do you think me planeei to find these crazy ones?

603
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,459
To excite still more the trip?

604
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,786
If we were in Sao Francisco 
we would have coffee of the guile in the bed,

605
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,265
Tennis the afternoon, several cocktails

606
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:47,540
Yes, and much more...

607
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:53,586
A lot of plates of the sea.
- Yes.

608
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:54,899
And wine.

609
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,305
Boss?

610
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,829
Yes, continue.

611
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,381
We have here some thing.
- Yes, what and?

612
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,507
Excuse, alarm false, they are two mountaineers 
that are to do a walk.

613
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,782
He/she seems that one of them this hurt.
- Will it verify and does he/she tell me some thing, ok?

614
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,309
Understood.

615
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,503
This certain friend, be calm.
I help you here...

616
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:56,826
Helicopter 4, this hearing?

617
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,662
Marty, these hearing me?

618
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:02,581
Marty, speech!

619
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,659
Helicopter 4, Marty in the he/she listens?

620
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,862
Marty, these to hear me?

621
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,947
You are not going me to say now that 
don't you know how to fly with this thing?

622
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,822
No, I don't know.

623
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,020
Already enter in the helicopter.

624
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,264
The best road?

625
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,467
The road no chosen.

626
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,821
Does he/she like to walk, Ray?

627
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,385
Yes. 
I am also surprised, I don't think to be his/her style.

628
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,103
Yes, and one of my favorite ones. 
I choose the less known highway.

629
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:48,542
And this makes all the difference.

630
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,901
Many roads, Frank exist, 
and you seem to find the wrong ones

631
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,670
This and the right moment to discuss poetry?

632
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,541
What ray and this?

633
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,379
This was created by an old glacier.
It was what was me dictated in the it finishes time.

634
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:10,387
This calls her "the brunettes."
- Porreiro.

635
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,706
Stones that deteriorated in the era of the ice were.

636
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,219
Him this certain, they are "brunet", this and the word.

637
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,580
If I don't do this, do they kill me, no and?

638
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,827
There is a great chance.
I think that yes.

639
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,585
I cannot make this with the handcuffs.

640
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,462
And necessary to have balance.

641
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,139
Ok.

642
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,705
But you can the for in front.

643
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,907
Father.
- Yes.

644
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,700
I only want to say that feel a lot.

645
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,662
I went me that offered the trip to camp.

646
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:37,749
Yes, but it was because I acted
in a stupid way...

647
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,625
The situation could be worse.
- Do you find?

648
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,863
Actually, not.

649
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,458
Carden, stop!

650
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,388
Chris, if he moves,

651
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:59,821
I want that point his leg and shoot.
- Only one moment.

652
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,387
I don't want to kill the bastard. 
I only want to delay him/her the speed.

653
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:06,145
I think this thing this very destroyed.

654
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:13,580
Can you help? 
- No, I won't destroy properties publish.

655
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:15,587
Almighty God!
- I am a broker.

656
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,508
I can lose my license.
- He/she goes, it helps him/it!

657
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:22,464
Let us go.

658
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:23,666
Let us go.

659
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:28,579
Ok. What?

660
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:31,622
You will do this side and me 
I will do here in low.

661
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:45,185
Yes, totally free. You this ready one?
Chris, this everything well? - Yes.

662
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:47,866
A...

663
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,625
Two...

664
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:57,939
Down.

665
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:02,786
I don't need to help.
I am the bad of the ribbon.

666
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:05,021
Two... Three!

667
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,063
Push.

668
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,269
We picked them.

669
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,989
Ei, Ei!

670
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,418
Here, light this.
What? - Watch him.

671
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:01,063
Here! Come here!
Come here! Us, here!

672
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,306
To the front, fast!

673
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,387
Here we are us!
- Come here!

674
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:08,263
Pick the man with the weapon.
- Don't fail.

675
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:18,028
Elderly good-bye.

676
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,582
He/she thinks of the to stabilize this thing.

677
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:24,906
I am trying, but the air in the group upward.

678
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,349
Chris, goes for you hoist them.

679
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,749
Bow!

680
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,619
We will leave of here immediately.
We have to continue!

681
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,143
You this well?

682
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:36,068
I don't have a good angle to shoot of here.

683
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,500
I solve this. 
Find a place to leave me.

684
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:36,499
I picked him/it
- Good work!

685
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:47,868
I hate amateurs.

686
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:32,665
Jesus.
- I thought that he had eliminated him/it.

687
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:34,629
Where and what him this?

688
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,063
The nut broke the back rotor.

689
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:44,340
We will leave of here.
Let us go!

690
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,622
He/she is not able to place him/it.

691
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:31,981
I don't get control him/it.

692
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,821
Where did he/she learn how to fly?
In Disneylandia?

693
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,907
What was that he/she said?
- Oh, My God!

694
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,580
Already remove that of here.

695
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:16,623
The mother's Filho!

696
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:30,585
Father.

697
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,221
One moment, and Duffin?
We have to return for taking.

698
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:34,863
We are not able to.
I saw them in the helicopter.

699
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,469
We are not able to leave him/it to us there.

700
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:38,865
It is impossible help him/it now,

701
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,580
and this can seem insensitive but...
...you two didn't seem to be happy.

702
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:50,423
Chris.

703
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,342
Come.

704
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,983
That incredible talent of destroying everything, Frank.

705
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:03,664
Lift that ass.
Walk!

706
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:32,626
The scouring pad and it stretches out are him to arrive.

707
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,423
I take this.

708
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:42,179
Here this. 
 - I don't want more coffee, he/she discovered some thing.

709
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:43,948
Nobody in the city heard some thing.

710
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,868
I have some information.
And on the helicopter that disappeared and the pilot.

711
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,025
He fell.
- Yes?

712
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,346
But no this there nobody and 
we don't also see bodies.
713
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,427
And possible to cover with earth to verify?

714
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:55,781
He said that no there is where to cover with earth. 
And a difficult place, Sr. Jennings.

715
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,499
Now that we lost him/it, we needed Clark.

716
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,225
I order personal,
but this will take some time.

717
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:03,705
That to the rhythm of the field, boss?

718
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,743
Balls, excuse me, Mr. Jennings.

719
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:10,899
He/she knows, the personnel of the forests and an awkward mouthful.
-Caracas.

720
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:21,748
Do see?
- Does he/she have a telephone?

721
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:24,418
Yes, and where slept before we will row.

722
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:25,949
Let us go.

723
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:43,658
Ok.

724
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,866
The line this without sign.
- What?

725
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,745
Chris, you said that there was a telephone.
- He/she has a telephone...

726
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:56,227
I feel a lot, but he/she didn't know that was not 
to work in this station.

727
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,260
OK.

728
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:05,583
For bed. - What?
- We go, Frank!

729
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:08,663
Are you new in this?

730
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,143
Where are the boats, Chris?
- They are not there!

731
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:21,342
I feel a lot, father
still no and time.

732
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:27,265
What will make now, Ray?
- I don't have idea none.

733
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:32,305
For me it arrives.
I need to rest.

734
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:45,302
I thought this it was good.
After all an amateur put an end to him.

735
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,341
Without he/she doubts, he only had luck.

736
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,060
Even in a dark rift
he would find squirrels.

737
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:53,979
If we don't find Carden it ties tomorrow,
we will lose the contract.

738
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:58,103
What and what was you sent? An e-mail?
- Maybe something so good.

739
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:10,660
See this, we are to arrive at the end.

740
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,029
Be with this.

741
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,383
What?
- Me... Ray?

742
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,421
For God's sake!
- Ray!

743
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:48,986
What do you think he/she did?
- What does think this and a game?

744
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:51,909
He/she thinks and a rodeo
and what you and a national hero?

745
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,943
You and a teacher, for God's sake!
Open the eyes!

746
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:58,218
Chris, speak to his/her father.

747
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,990
Try do him/it to understand.
Maybe he hears him/it.

748
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:03,501
Do you think like this?
- Yes.

749
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:07,944
Funny, I never thought 
that he heard me.

750
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:12,503
Do hear, what and what do you want?
What do I convince him free her/it him?

751
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:13,699
Yes, something like that.

752
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,982
Yes, but what had avoided yours
friends of to come here and to kill us.

753
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:19,658
No, that won't happen.
He/she has my word.

754
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:22,460
It has been very effective stop her/it them 
it ties Frank now.

755
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:25,460
Balls.
- What did go now he/she?

756
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,626
Inside of this thing he/she only has classic music.

757
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:30,025
I knew that some thing was not well with him.

758
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:33,267
Are you the sure of the one what this to do?
- Shut up and continue to walk.

759
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:42,108
Did he/she know that this and funny?

760
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,669
Home we were more or less separate.

761
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,500
His idea of we camp was that 
we were together one of the other.

762
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:54,618
I dislike to camp.
He knew about this.

763
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:58,220
The forests are beautiful, but me...
...I don't simply want to sleep in them.

764
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,182
I want a service of rooms.
- Right.

765
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:03,221
Mini-bar.
- Yes.

766
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,907
What and what do you make?
Do you know, in the real world?

767
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:14,660
I produce commercial announcements for TV.
- That and excellent.

768
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:19,580
Did you already meet some advertising one?
- No.

769
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:23,019
They are of the worst.
- Yes?

770
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:29,862
I don't make the low idealizes 
of as it uses this thing, Ray.

771
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:34,749
No there is a lot what to speak.
Simply appear and pull the trigger.

772
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:36,265
Ray.

773
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:39,100
Ray!

774
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:43,982
They will wait for the darkness, 
I will make him/her mine finishes offer.

775
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,143
Remove me the handcuffs.

776
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,830
And let to break before the fire to begin.

777
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:51,622
Practice in him.

778
01:08:03,896 --> 01:08:05,488
This very darkness, boss.

779
01:08:06,576 --> 01:08:11,092
Continue a little more and later return.
- It can have faith.

780
01:08:21,856 --> 01:08:23,892
Did you and his/her father camp frequently?

781
01:08:24,216 --> 01:08:27,925
No, nor for that.
I think us...

782
01:08:31,016 --> 01:08:32,927
we are to create bows

783
01:08:33,936 --> 01:08:35,688
Don't say anything else...

784
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:55,655
Maybe be wrong.
- No, they are there.

785
01:09:06,536 --> 01:09:09,096
Ei, wait for my sign.

786
01:09:20,816 --> 01:09:23,125
Chris. Ei, Chris.

787
01:09:38,896 --> 01:09:40,693
We only want Carden!

788
01:09:41,336 --> 01:09:43,167
Frank, everything well?

789
01:09:43,376 --> 01:09:44,934
Yes, I am well.

790
01:09:45,136 --> 01:09:47,604
Feel Carden and we left them alone.

791
01:10:03,216 --> 01:10:04,888
Last hypothesis.

792
01:10:06,096 --> 01:10:07,973
Surrender Carden.

793
01:10:16,016 --> 01:10:19,486
You this alone one, Ray.
The choice and yours.

794
01:10:19,936 --> 01:10:23,053
Think about his/her son, in his/her wife.

795
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:28,488
You don't need to prove anything,
you already made this.

796
01:10:29,216 --> 01:10:31,093
I am convinced.

797
01:10:53,856 --> 01:10:55,289
Be careful, son.

798
01:11:13,496 --> 01:11:14,724
No!

799
01:11:15,456 --> 01:11:16,855
Roy!

800
01:11:30,096 --> 01:11:32,326
Royko, Royko!

801
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:38,412
Quiet.
- Balls.

802
01:11:42,016 --> 01:11:43,165
Bow.

803
01:11:59,656 --> 01:12:01,567
Chris? Chris!

804
01:12:16,216 --> 01:12:17,490
Father!

805
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:24,327
Father! Father!

806
01:12:28,016 --> 01:12:30,655
Place the weapon!
Place her

807
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:36,495
I take the boy, Ray.
- Father.

808
01:12:36,696 --> 01:12:39,256
If he/she wants to return her see him/it alive, don't come behind me.
- Father!

809
01:12:39,456 --> 01:12:41,526
I am to leave!
- Father.

810
01:13:09,656 --> 01:13:14,411
Hear, if you ask help, 
to scream or to try to flee...

811
01:13:14,616 --> 01:13:16,447
Do I break you the neck, did he/she understand?
- Yes.

812
01:13:16,656 --> 01:13:18,692
Don't think that I am a good person.

813
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:31,245
No, he/she hears. This will have to be like this.

814
01:13:31,456 --> 01:13:33,970
If the White House interferes,
you will be involved in this...

815
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:36,094
He/she already said that I treat of this.

816
01:13:37,216 --> 01:13:39,969
I was informed that the President 
he/she had not changed their plans.

817
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:41,490
They don't want to change anything.

818
01:13:41,616 --> 01:13:43,572
We have to use ours
resources for protecting.

819
01:13:43,776 --> 01:13:46,574
But, Carden had tried to execute
with firmness his/her purpose.

820
01:13:46,776 --> 01:13:48,494
But he lost previously
all his/her team.

821
01:13:48,696 --> 01:13:50,493
He has the contract, it had tried to accomplish him/it.

822
01:13:50,696 --> 01:13:52,687
Him and a person that he/she acts like this.
- How and what does that know?

823
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:54,727
We already worked with him in the past.

824
01:13:56,936 --> 01:13:58,654
And on the boy?
- What boy?

825
01:13:58,856 --> 01:14:00,812
The boy that he took with him.
Chris... or something like that.

826
01:14:01,016 --> 01:14:05,089
Our main objectivo and to protect the president.
- Sr. Yen, Ray Iene.

827
01:14:05,496 --> 01:14:09,409
Ray Iene, his/her son was taken as hostage.
- Naturally.

828
01:14:10,456 --> 01:14:11,889
What and what this to do to find my son?

829
01:14:12,016 --> 01:14:14,849
Sr. Yen, we are us his/her son's search,
we are to do the possible ones.

830
01:14:15,056 --> 01:14:18,287
There is his possibility to die.
I know him/it as and difficult for itself.

831
01:14:34,376 --> 01:14:37,049
This everything in order?
Everything well?

832
01:14:43,296 --> 01:14:45,332
You know, Ray, 
we will make everything to be within our reach.

833
01:14:47,136 --> 01:14:50,765
But most of my personnel was moved away 
because of the President in Woodburn.

834
01:14:51,096 --> 01:14:52,893
But after this...

835
01:15:04,656 --> 01:15:06,647
I don't believe that you have failed.

836
01:15:06,856 --> 01:15:09,245
I want Carden to disappear.

837
01:15:09,456 --> 01:15:11,014
I don't want him to go back to Washington.

838
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:13,525
I don't want him to speak to anybody.
- I understood.

839
01:15:13,816 --> 01:15:15,613
It is if the son is alive,

840
01:15:16,816 --> 01:15:18,932
knife with that seems that Carden has him/it dead.

841
01:15:19,216 --> 01:15:23,528
The boy's father and Ray Reene.
Only God knows what Carden told him/her.

842
01:15:23,736 --> 01:15:26,011
Him no and a professional?
He didn't tell him/her anything.

843
01:15:26,216 --> 01:15:28,730
We cannot take risks.
Everything turns off.

844
01:15:29,136 --> 01:15:31,127
Davis, be not disappointed.

845
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:33,048
