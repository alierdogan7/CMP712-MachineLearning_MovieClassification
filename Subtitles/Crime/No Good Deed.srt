00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:21,688
<i>Live from WZIL,</i> News 25 <i>at noon starts now.</i>

2
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,235
<i>Colin Evans,
convicted of voluntary manslaughter</i>

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,696
<i>for one of the most brutal murders
in recent history,</i>

4
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,531
<i>is up for parole today.</i>

5
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:37,746
<i>Five years ago, Evans was one of
the most wanted men in state history,</i>

6
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:41,332
<i>having emerged as the prime suspect
in the disappearance of five young women.</i>

7
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,628
<i>Evans was eventually apprehended
for the crimes,</i>

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,966
<i>only to escape
and elude authorities for several months,</i>

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,845
<i>until the night he was arrested
for the fatal barroom brawl</i>

10
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,306
<i>that would lead
to his manslaughter conviction.</i>

11
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,309
<i>The evidence necessary to try Evans</i>

12
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>for the abduction of
the five young women proved illusory.</i>

13
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:08,193
<i>The DA's office decided to settle for what
it knew it could prove in a court of law.</i>

14
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,988
<i>Hence, the lesser manslaughter conviction.</i>

15
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,825
<i>No mention of Evans
being the primary suspect</i>

16
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,788
<i>in the disappearance and
presumed death of the five young women</i>

17
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,123
<i>was ever made at his manslaughter trial.</i>

18
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,169
<i>But now, on a day
when one of the most feared men</i>

19
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,214
<i>in the annals of state history might walk</i>

20
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:33,176
<i>after having served
only five years in prison for manslaughter,</i>

21
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:38,181
<i>the five families are huddled together
outside the courthouse hoping and praying</i>

22
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,810
<i>that the man they believe to be
nothing more than a vicious animal,</i>

23
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,812
<i>is not set free.</i>

24
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,573
I'm hoping you get a
fair shake today, Colin.

25
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,527
I prayed hard for it Sunday.

26
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,903
I appreciate that.

27
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,613
In my experience,

28
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,158
if you give a man a second chance,
usually, they rise to the occasion.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,660
Well, except politicians.

30
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,704
I've never met one of them
ever learned from their mistakes.

31
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,622
What about you, Officer Reid?

32
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,167
Can I count on your support?

33
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,379
They pay me to guard
you, not to talk to you.

34
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,756
Don't mind him, Colin.
He's got woman troubles.

35
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,342
You know how that goes.

36
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,263
Yeah.

37
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:24,561
<i>Colin Evans, currently serving 10 to
15 years for involuntary manslaughter.</i>

38
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,106
<i>Let the record show you've requested
to address the parole board</i>

39
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,734
<i>in lieu of your attorney. You may begin.</i>

40
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,318
Thank you, sir.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,408
I'm not going to stand here and lie to you,
because I'm not very good at that.

42
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,413
When I was sentenced, I was angry.

43
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,065
I told myself fights like this
get out of hand all the time.

44
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,045
Accidents happen and I could have
easily been the man that died that night.

45
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,342
But as time went by, I realized I was
wrong. I shouldn't have been angry.

46
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,303
I should have been ashamed.

47
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:02,807
A man had died, and there was
no way I could bring him back.

48
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,021
But I could make a change within myself.

49
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,106
And others, perhaps.

50
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:15,612
I started a teaching program,
teaching other prisoners to read and write.

51
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,280
And the warden saw this,

52
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,909
and they're talking about taking
my program statewide to other prisons.

53
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,912
I feel like that's an achievement.

54
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,796
I stand here right now as a changed,
humble man.

55
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:38,134
I've been in the prison correctional system
for five years now,

56
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,554
and that is exactly what I am, corrected.

57
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,140
Rehabilitated.

58
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,477
I just wanted you to give me a chance.

59
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,564
I won't let you down.

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,151
Thank you for your time.

61
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,449
Mr. Chairman, if I could
have just a moment?

62
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,243
Go ahead.

63
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,037
You see, I did my homework on this man.

64
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:13,169
And I can tell you with confidence
that he's actually quite a good liar.

65
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,880
That fight that got out of hand,

66
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,426
that was actually
Mr. Evans flying into a murderous rage

67
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,887
because of how
the victim was looking at his girlfriend.

68
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,141
And as a younger man,
there were other acts of violence,

69
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,060
frequently involving
the attentions of a woman.

70
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,440
Mr. Evans fits the criteria
of a malignant narcissist.

71
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:39,279
Charming, highly intelligent,
as you've witnessed,

72
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:45,201
but malignant narcissists
are compelled to prove their superiority.

73
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,370
Everything's a seduction,

74
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,415
and if they're rejected,

75
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,752
or things don't go their way,
they lose control.

76
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,173
Some other
more well-known malignant narcissists were

77
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,343
Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy...

78
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,385
Now, hold on.

79
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,095
No. Sir. Sir.

80
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,057
Mr. Evans, please, just sit down.

81
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,018
Please sit down, Mr. Evans.

82
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,565
I can tell you there's
violence in this man.

83
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,694
And his control over himself is slender.

84
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,822
I'll let my fellow board members
make up their own minds,

85
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,742
but there are five families outside

86
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:30,205
who are hoping and praying
that we do not set Colin Evans free.

87
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,291
Mr. Evans, as I'm sure you're aware,

88
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,044
to be granted parole
in the state of Tennessee,

89
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,713
it must be a unanimous vote.

90
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,217
We'll take this up again in five years,
as mandated.

91
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,182
Ladies and gentlemen, that convenes the state
of Tennessee parole hearing for today.

92
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,559
Madame Secretary,
you can turn off your recording devices.

93
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,721
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are free to go at this time.

94
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,885
I don't know what to say, Colin.

95
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,387
Why even waste your breath?

96
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,434
A little help. My nose is bleeding.

97
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,145
- Reid.
- He'll be fine.

98
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,022
Give him a tissue or something.

99
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,405
Here.

100
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,080
Shit!

101
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,790
- No, no, put the gun down!
- No!

102
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,797
Or you can watch him die
and I don't want that!

103
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,502
- No!
- You don't want that.

104
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,589
Put the gun down
and you both walk out of here!

105
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,134
Come on.
I just want to get out of here, that's all.

106
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,054
Colin, please.

107
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,680
You have my word.

108
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,475
Go on.

109
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,770
Come on.

110
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,814
Just put it down. Just put it down!

111
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,183
Yes, I'm still here.

112
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,894
Yeah. Ryan, honey, please don't do that.

113
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,730
Yeah, can you please tell me
how long ago my husband left?

114
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,066
Ryan, stop it.

115
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,235
Yeah. Javier, one second.

116
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,863
Yeah, well, if he checks in,
can you please have him call me?

117
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:13,076
Yeah. Thanks, Karen. Okay. Bye-bye.
What's up?

118
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,744
There's a storm coming.

119
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,598
Is everything gonna be okay out there?

120
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,040
I covered the concrete with plastic.

121
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,209
It will delay the dry-time a little,
but nothing to worry about...

122
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,462
Ryan, paint Mommy a picture.
Please, go make me a picture. Go ahead.

123
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,089
Come on. Go get your coloring book.

124
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,427
With the storm coming,
there's really not much we can do.

125
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,270
Hey, Javier. The house is looking great.

126
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,897
- It's getting there. Have a good weekend.
- You, too. Bye.

127
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,274
All right, let's go, guys. Load it up!

128
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,942
- Terry?
- Hey!

129
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,027
Hey!

130
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,988
- When are they going to be done?
- Last month.

131
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,865
Maybe I should remodel.

132
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,287
Who's got the prettiest goddaughter
in the whole world?

133
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,621
You!

134
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,082
- And who's Meg's best friend?
- Ryan.

135
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,876
- And who's Ryan's best friend?
- Meg.

136
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,961
- And what's all the rest?
- Bullshit!

137
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,964
Meg. Yeah, you're going to school

138
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,425
the first time she gets called
to the principal's office, not me.

139
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,843
What's he look like, and is he single?

140
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,971
You are a mess, but you look good.

141
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,139
Thanks. So do you.

142
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,640
Yeah, covered in spit-up

143
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:21,311
and carrying an extra
10 pounds, but thanks.

144
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,856
Do you know what I think? I think you're
not the reason you feel bad about yourself.

145
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,985
I think that Jeffrey should be making
you feel appreciated and he should...

146
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,488
Meg, Jeffrey makes me
feel appreciated, okay?

147
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,655
He appreciates me.

148
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,817
- I am just saying... Okay.
- Thanks for your concern.

149
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,246
Daddy! Daddy!

150
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,415
Hey, sweetheart.

151
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,001
- Jeffrey's home early.
- I forgot to tell you.

152
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,171
It's his dad's birthday, so,
he's taking him on a golf trip.

153
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,343
Okay. You know what?
We're going to have a girls' night.

154
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,179
- I'm going to get some wine.
- Great.

155
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,806
My girl needs a girls' night.

156
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,391
We're going to get drunk!

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,893
I can't wait.

158
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,645
Hey, Jeffrey.

159
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,230
Hey, Meg.

160
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,690
What are the two of you up to?

161
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,568
You know, just braiding each other's hair
and talking about the boys we like.

162
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,237
Meg stopped by on her run.

163
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,197
Which I should probably get back to,
so, I'll see you tonight?

164
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,990
Yes, I can't wait.

165
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,575
Jeffrey, you're a lucky man.

166
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,412
Yes, I am.

167
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,288
- See you later, Meg.
- Bye, honey.

168
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,541
- Hi.
- Hello, darling.

169
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,835
Damn, baby.

170
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,463
I was feeding your children.
Can you try not to act so grossed out?

171
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,217
I'm sorry. It's just this Hopkins case
is turning into a nightmare.

172
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,052
The judge rejected our plea today.

173
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,388
I am sorry to hear that.

174
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,099
That's life, right?

175
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,520
I saw that Meg sold
that house down by the school.

176
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,563
She must be making a killing.

177
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,398
Meg has quite the life.

178
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,236
Here we go. I'm home two minutes
and you're already being negative.

179
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,239
- All I said was that Meg had the life.
- And you don't?

180
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,323
Jeffrey, I...

181
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,784
Babe, just remember
it was your idea to be a full-time mom.

182
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,037
This is what you wanted, not me.

183
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,330
Yes, it is what I wanted, Jeffrey.

184
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,668
I hardly saw you all week
and I'm going to miss you.

185
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,755
I know. I'm sorry. Okay?

186
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,591
Let's get away. Okay? Just you and me.

187
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,052
Without the kids.
Somewhere for a couple of days.

188
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,721
We need it. It's been a long time.

189
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,514
Okay?

190
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,809
All right. We can do that.

191
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,608
I'm going to the store.

192
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,668
That way, you can spend
some time with the kids before you leave.

193
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,112
No, wait a minute. No, no.

194
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,655
I'm already running late
and I still got to pack.

195
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,492
Jeffrey. That's why
I asked you to be home early.

196
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,619
It's my dad's birthday.

197
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,915
I'm going to go pack.

198
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:44,055
You're not taking your big, warm coat?
It's going to be cold up there.

199
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,850
It's just two hours away. I'll be fine.

200
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,729
They say the storm is
going to be really bad.

201
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,814
Are you sure
you want to drive all the way there?

202
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,776
Is all this worrying
because you need me to stay?

203
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,945
Of course not. I know how important
this is for your father.

204
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,740
I better get going.

205
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,034
Tell your dad I said, "Happy birthday."

206
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,535
I will.

207
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,328
Make sure you use the alarm
when I'm gone, all right?

208
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,707
I know, I know,
but just use it for my peace of mind.

209
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,042
All right.

210
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,377
- Do you remember the code?
- Yes. I'll use it.

211
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,462
All right.

212
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,474
I'll miss you.

213
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,268
When I get back, we'll plan that trip.

214
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,633
Maybe, we'll go back to
that little place on the vineyard.

215
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,730
How does that sound?

216
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,024
Great.

217
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,155
I love you.

218
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,865
I love you, too.

219
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,894
<i>Hey, it's RenÃ©e.
I hope you're having a great day.</i>

220
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,979
<i>Listen, we should catch up this weekend.</i>

221
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,274
<i>I have to tell you about
the horrible date I went on last week.</i>

222
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:23,029
<i>Anyway, give me a call and maybe
we can meet up for a movie or something?</i>

223
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,280
<i>Talk to you soon. Bye.</i>

224
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,448
Honey, I'm home.

225
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,083
Colin...

226
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,418
I just want to talk.

227
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:51,725
You know, I wanted to tell you
that after what happened that night,

228
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,229
I don't blame you for pulling away from me.

229
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,898
You know, moving out here.

230
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,113
The point is,
I can't do anything about that now.

231
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,908
When I was in prison,

232
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,289
I thought a lot about you.

233
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,137
What do you want from me?

234
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,515
I just want you to forgive me.

235
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,770
Give me a chance.

236
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,523
I know someone that can make passports.

237
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:45,945
We can get two new names.
Travel, you know?

238
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,149
Go around the world, you and me,
like we talked about.

239
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,830
Maybe get married.

240
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,506
Would you come with me?

241
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,180
I'm going to need an answer, yes or no.

242
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,641
Yes.

243
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,018
Yes?

244
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,646
Do you still love me?

245
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,022
Yes.

246
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,711
Because I wrote you a lot of letters
and you ain't answer them.

247
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,572
But that's because I
didn't know what to say.

248
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,951
And there's no one else?

249
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,452
- No.
- That's right.

250
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,083
Because you still love me.

251
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,130
Right?

252
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,760
Is that him?

253
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,930
- Who?
- "Who?"

254
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,476
The guy I saw you talking to
at the coffee shop.

255
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,521
Nice looking fellow.

256
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,190
He and I are going to
have to have a chat later on.

257
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,110
He's my trainer. He wanted to
talk to me about his boyfriend.

258
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,194
His boyfriend?

259
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,614
Do you think I spent five years in prison
for you to come and lie to me now?

260
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,533
Where did you meet him?

261
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,121
You know, I found this on your bed.

262
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,423
"Didn't want to wake you,

263
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,136
"'cause you look so beautiful
when you sleep."

264
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,472
Colin...

265
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,185
- I tried to wait.
- No, you didn't.

266
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,690
I found these, too.

267
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,651
You didn't even read any of these.

268
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:52,155
Didn't read that one. Not one. Not one!

269
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,246
Hey!

270
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,624
Hey! No!

271
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,294
Here.

272
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,848
- Colin!
- You didn't give me a chance!

273
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,686
You murdered a man!

274
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,398
It's manslaughter in the eyes of the law.
It's very, very different.

275
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,358
And those girls? What about them?

276
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,064
Does he even know about me?

277
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,862
Who?

278
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,409
Do you love him? Do you love him?

279
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,252
- Leave me alone.
- Just tell me. Just tell me!

280
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,037
- Leave me alone!
- Just answer the question!

281
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,707
- What?
- Did you have sex in this bed?

282
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,711
You're just being ridiculous. It's stupid.

283
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,504
That's what's going on?

284
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,550
While I'm in jail, you're sitting here
having sex with this man. Is that right?

285
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,428
Why don't you just tell me the truth?
Why don't you just tell me?

286
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,887
Yes! Yes, Colin!

287
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:03,727
We do it right here, in this bed.
All the time! And it's great!

288
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,552
Is that what you want to hear?

289
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:10,734
Is that what I need to say
to get you to just leave me alone?

290
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,153
Just leave me alone.

291
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,374
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,294
I'm sorry.

293
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,296
That's okay.

294
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,926
- I just missed you.
- It's okay.

295
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,804
I missed you so much.

296
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,268
I...

297
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,606
I am done!

298
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:34,150
Shit. Okay.

299
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:50,625
<i>Mr. Evans fits the criteria
of a malignant narcissist.</i>

300
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,630
<i>Some other more well-known
malignant narcissists were</i>

301
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,716
<i>Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy...</i>

302
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,609
Cut those up.

303
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,831
Go ahead, cut it up and
put it on the plate.

304
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,965
That's very good. Big girl.

305
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,470
Okay, baby. Finish that up, okay?
I'll be right back.

306
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,764
Okay, Mommy.

307
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,185
You are so early.

308
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,772
Hello?

309
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,441
Hello?

310
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,778
I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you.

311
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,489
You were the only house with the lights on.

312
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:49,452
I just lost control of my car.
I skidded and wrecked it.

313
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,539
- Are you all right?
- I'm good. I just had a scratch.

314
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,873
Oh, my God.

315
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,793
I'm all right.
Do you think I could use your phone?

316
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,006
I don't even need to come in.

317
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,609
I'll stand right here.
You can hand the phone and shut the door.

318
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,306
Okay. I'll be right back.

319
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,642
All right, thank you.

320
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,609
Okay, baby.
I guess somebody needs to use the phone.

321
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,153
Okay, finish cutting that up, baby.

322
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,904
Put it on the plate,
and then come over here and eat,

323
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,615
because I want you in bed
at a decent hour tonight, okay?

324
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,201
- Okay.
- All right. I'll be right back.

325
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,163
Okay. Here.

326
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,126
- I'll get that for you.
- You don't have to worry about that.

327
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,919
That's all right.

328
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,464
I really can get that later.

329
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,175
You know,
the one time I forget my cell phone...

330
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,678
- Here.
- Thank you.

331
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,347
Oh, boy.

332
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,475
Do you live around here?

333
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,980
- Yeah, over on River Road.
- Okay.

334
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,398
Yeah.

335
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,566
Mommy!

336
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,780
- I'm feeding my daughter. I'm sorry.
- Go on.

337
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,532
Look, why don't you make the call
and I'll be right back?

338
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,035
- Go on. I'll be fine.
- Okay. All right.

339
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,244
Okay, Ryan.

340
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,087
Ryan. I need your help, baby.

341
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,464
I'm trying to help a neighbor.
You have to clean that up.

342
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,634
Lord.

343
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:31,054
Wait right... I'll be back, baby.

344
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:37,102
Yeah, it's going to need a tow.

345
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,354
It's totaled.

346
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,398
Hold on.

347
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,942
Is there anyone here
that can give me a ride to my car?

348
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:47,612
They want me to sign something
before they can tow me.

349
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:48,863
My husband's not home...

350
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,909
...yet, but he should be home soon.

351
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,036
You know what?

352
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,478
Why don't you have them
meet you here just in case he's late?

353
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,499
- Here?
- Yeah.

354
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,002
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's fine.

355
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:06,381
Okay. Sir, is there any way the driver
can meet me here where I am right now?

356
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,508
Great.

357
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,594
- I'm at...
- 17 Creston Lane.

358
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,471
- 17...
- Creston...

359
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,764
- Creston.
- ...Lane.

360
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:15,807
Lane.

361
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,226
- All right.
- Okay.

362
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:22,564
He said he doesn't know how long it's going
to take because of the storm, but...

363
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,193
They're on their way. So, thank you again.

364
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,571
- Yeah, sure.
- I appreciate it.

365
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,990
- All right.
- Okay.

366
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:38,121
You know what?

367
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,462
- You can come in.
- I don't want to bother you.

368
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,630
No, it's no bother. Just come on.

369
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:49,799
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

370
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:54,095
I can't leave you out in the rain
to bleed to death. It's fine.

371
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:56,014
- You're sure?
- I'm positive.

372
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,726
- Thank you.
- That cut's really bad.

373
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,437
No, it's not that bad.

374
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,856
Yeah, let me see if I
have something for that.

375
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,942
- Stay right there. I'll be right back.
- All right.

376
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,949
Okay.

377
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,828
- It's really nice of you...
- Okay, there's this.

378
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:23,667
...to look after a stranger

379
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,169
on your doorstep like this.

380
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:31,091
I mean, really, you don't have to do this.

381
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:37,681
Like I said, I couldn't leave you
out in the rain bleeding like that.

382
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,892
You can dry yourself off with that.
You can come over here.

383
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,354
This is all I have, so, hopefully,
I can patch you up.

384
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,564
It's a beautiful house you've got here.

385
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,941
Thanks.

386
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,985
- Let me get this for you. Thank you.
- Okay.

387
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,780
- Do you want me to take that for you?
- No, I'll just leave it here.

388
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:55,198
Okay.

389
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,744
Okay. Let's see.

390
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,790
Well, hello, little princess.
What's your name?

391
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,919
This is Ryan.

392
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:10,547
- I'm a superhero!
- Ryan, no hitting.

393
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:15,468
That's a mean right hook you have there.
Who taught you that, your daddy?

394
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,930
I'm so sorry. I don't know where
she's learning this from.

395
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,765
Ryan, do me a favor.

396
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,809
Go in the kitchen
and get Mommy a wet paper towel,

397
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,477
so I can clean up his boo-boo.

398
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,896
- She is so beautiful.
- Thank you.

399
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:28,815
Is that your only child?

400
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,901
No. Sam's in the nursery, sleeping.

401
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,738
You lucked out.

402
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,906
It can be quite the zoo
around here sometimes.

403
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,783
And trust me,

404
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:43,580
I don't turn down an opportunity to
have some adult interaction these days.

405
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,874
Thank you, baby.

406
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,710
Finish cleaning up your mess, okay?

407
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,213
All right, let's see here.

408
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:01,514
You must have thought I was your husband.
At the door?

409
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:05,060
Yeah, he'll be home shortly.

410
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,853
Yeah, you said.

411
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,023
So, I'm Colin.

412
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,444
- Terry.
- Terry?

413
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:15,945
Nice to meet you.

414
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,873
Okay. That should do it.

415
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,919
I don't think I'll put a Band-Aid on it.
It looks like it needs to breathe.

416
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,215
Okay, bugaboo. What about <i>Spy Dogs?</i>

417
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,675
<i>- Spy Dogs!</i>
- Yeah!

418
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,636
Bye-bye. Watch some <i>Spy Dogs.</i>

419
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,971
<i>- Spy Dogs.</i>
- Say, "Bye-bye."

420
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:46,267
<i>Spy Dogs, Spy Dogs.</i>
Get you good and sleepy.

421
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:56,277
Okay. God, that should keep her occupied.

422
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,862
You know what?

423
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:01,366
Why don't you come in here?
I'll see if I have a dry shirt for you.

424
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,457
You're soaking wet. Here.

425
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,419
- Thank you.
- Hopefully, the sizes are okay.

426
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,587
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

427
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:22,929
So, your husband went to NYU?

428
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:27,183
We both did, actually.
We met in law school.

429
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:30,395
So, you're both lawyers?

430
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:35,817
Yeah. I was a prosecutor
at the DA's office.

431
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:41,156
- That's fascinating.
- It was.

432
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:45,118
Well, most of my cases
were violence against women.

433
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,495
They're easier to make.

434
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:48,621
Why is that?

435
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:52,000
Well, it's almost always
someone close to the victim.

436
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,794
- Husband, boyfriend.
- They beat them?

437
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:59,049
They kill them.
I worked in the homicide division.

438
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,552
I bet you were
a force to be reckoned with, though.

439
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,724
That's the nicest thing
anyone has said to me in a long time.

440
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:10,769
Come here.

441
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,563
There you go. Got it.

442
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,994
Give me your shirt. I can dry that for you.

443
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,444
Right. Okay.

444
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:23,114
It helped that the men made my job easy.

445
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,240
How come?

446
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:29,621
Unlike what you see on TV,
most killers aren't that smart or clever.

447
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,247
Actually, they're pretty pathetic.

448
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,376
- Pathetic?
- Yeah, they're weak.

449
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,379
Shit, that's going to wake Sam.

450
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:06,199
- Is everything all right?
- No. It's not working.

451
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,702
- It does this sometimes.
- Do you want me to take a look?

452
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:13,123
Do you mind?
Yeah, just grab that coat right there.

453
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,086
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

454
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,395
Alarm. Alarm.

455
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,648
- It's loud!
- Yes!

456
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:42,485
It says there's a valet button
underneath the steering wheel.

457
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:45,052
- Wait. I think I know where that is.
- You know where it is?

458
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,157
- That's not it.
- What now?

459
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,409
We need to do something else.

460
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:55,123
- What did you do?
- I have no idea.

461
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:04,758
That was bizarre.

462
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:08,845
I don't know. Maybe it was a fuse.
Something's gone wrong.

463
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,015
Let me lock this.

464
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,435
Do you want some hot tea?

465
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,187
- Sure.
- Okay.

466
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,128
Did you get lost?

467
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,339
No.

468
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:47,050
I'm just drying off.

469
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,685
- Is this your husband?
- Yeah.

470
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:57,769
Nice.

471
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:59,396
What about you? Are you married?

472
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,274
Girlfriend?

473
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,489
- Ex-fiancÃ©e.
- I'm sorry.

474
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,950
Yeah. It just happened.

475
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,453
Sugar? Fresh lemon?

476
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:16,663
She was cheating on me.

477
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,581
That's got to hurt.

478
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,085
The knowing is the tough part.

479
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:26,715
The act itself, well, that's going to
happen whether you know about it or not.

480
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,552
The only way to stop it is to know more.

481
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:34,597
So, you want to know who he was,
what he was wearing, what he was driving.

482
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,809
It sounds like torture.

483
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:42,564
No, it's worse. It's like getting
your heart ripped out of your chest.

484
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:49,612
Yeah, but at least you know.
Isn't that better?

485
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,199
No.

486
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,455
- We were going to get married.
- I can tell you, marriage is not all that.

487
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,667
- Do you still love him?
- Of course.

488
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,589
I guess I just miss my own fire.
Does that make sense?

489
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,549
Yeah.

490
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,927
When we met, I was independent,

491
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,265
strong, and powerful.

492
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,771
I just think he sees me differently now.

493
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,863
He's just gone blind, that's all.

494
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:36,117
Because you're still beautiful, powerful,

495
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,620
fierce.

496
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,667
Yeah.

497
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:48,838
I'm going to go put Ryan to sleep.

498
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:54,052
- Can I use the restroom?
- It's this way.

499
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,860
- Night-night, bugaboo.
- Night-night.

500
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:12,320
Okay.

501
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,934
You scared me.

502
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:34,736
Is everything okay?

503
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,821
I couldn't find the sugar.

504
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:41,451
I offered you sugar.

505
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,162
Are you looking for your husband?

506
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,168
I feel silly.

507
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,130
He's not coming home.

508
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,341
He's not what?

509
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:02,305
The tow truck's here.

510
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:20,657
- Hey!
- Hey.

511
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,159
- Did you walk?
- It's just down the street. I'm fine.

512
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,036
Crazy lady, give me that coat.

513
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,871
- You're soaking...
- I know.

514
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,623
- Here. Give me the coat.
- Sorry.

515
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:31,626
Look, I meant to call you because I have...

516
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:34,212
- What?
- Hi.

517
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,634
Hi. And who are you?

518
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:40,969
I'm Colin.

519
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,053
That's why I wanted to call you.

520
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:46,891
Colin got into an accident and I was
the first house that he stumbled upon,

521
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,560
and he needed to use the phone.

522
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:51,187
So, he called a tow truck
and we're just waiting for the tow truck.

523
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:53,606
- We're waiting.
- You don't have your own cell phone?

524
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,233
I left it at home.

525
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:00,697
That cut's pretty nasty. Are you all right?

526
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:03,199
No, I'm good. Terry's
been looking after me.

527
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:05,076
- I'm sure she has.
- Stop it.

528
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,037
She's a good little nurse, isn't she?

529
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,623
Well, listen, I thought
we were going to have a girls' night,

530
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,710
but I suppose we can all share.

531
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:16,087
Yeah, sure. I'll get glasses.

532
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:21,885
- Meg.
- Meg. Colin.

533
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,219
- So you said.
- Right.

534
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:25,055
You know,

535
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,433
it's funny.

536
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,561
I thought I knew all the good
looking men in this town.

537
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,604
I bet you do.

538
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,065
Well, obviously not.

539
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,650
- Now, where do you live?
- River Road.

540
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,278
Hey, I just sold a house there.

541
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,406
- I'm a realtor.
- Really?

542
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:47,452
Yeah, 6267. It's an old Georgian.

543
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:49,412
It was a horrible shade of brown.
The new owners just painted.

544
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:52,749
Do you know the one?
Do you know the one that I'm talking about?

545
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,418
- The new owners just painted.
- Nope.

546
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,660
- No, I don't think I've seen that one.
- I know all the families on that street.

547
00:38:58,672 --> 00:38:59,673
What's your address?

548
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:03,760
- Come on. What is it?
- My address?

549
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:04,962
Yeah, which house are you in?

550
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:07,972
Are you going to stalk me?

551
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:09,766
You should be so lucky.

552
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,268
Yeah, I think I should stalk you.

553
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:15,772
Now, seriously, where do you live?

554
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:17,273
I...

555
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,610
What happened?

556
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:21,945
Terry, are you okay? What happened?

557
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,468
God, that scared the hell out of me.

558
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:25,657
- Look at that.
- You got garbage bags?

559
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,784
- Duct tape? Garbage bags?
- What? Yeah, everything's in there.

560
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:30,120
Do you believe that?
That was such a freak accident.

561
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:33,248
No, I'm fine,
but that scared the shit out of me.

562
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,378
- Jeffrey's not going to be happy.
- No, he's not.

563
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:41,881
- It's just a broken branch. There you go.
- I need a drink.

564
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,592
Jeffrey's not going to like that.

565
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:50,265
- Colin, you're so handy.
- I've fixed a couple of windows before.

566
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,018
Stop it.

567
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,271
- Come on.
- This is for you.

568
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:57,647
Thank you.

569
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,524
- To Terry.
- Me?

570
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:03,987
A great friend, a great mom,
and a great wife...

571
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,071
Thank you.

572
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,490
- ...who Jeffrey doesn't deserve.
- Meg.

573
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,159
To Terry.

574
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,244
Cheers.

575
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,507
You were thirsty.

576
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,510
Come on, let's go in the living room.
Bring the bottle.

577
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:29,471
Come on. I'll give you some more.

578
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:30,680
Meg.

579
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:31,931
<i>Exactly what I needed.</i>

580
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:34,726
A definite step up from tea, huh?

581
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:37,854
- You guys were drinking tea?
- Yeah. It's cold out.

582
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:42,484
Terry, a man that looks like this
shows up on your doorstep,

583
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:43,818
and you offer him tea.

584
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,863
You would have plied him full of alcohol.

585
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:49,532
Yes. I would have.

586
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:51,701
Would you have taken advantage of me?

587
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:53,703
Where's your glass?

588
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:57,540
In every way possible.

589
00:40:58,416 --> 00:40:59,793
Cheers.

590
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:03,546
Married women so quickly
forget what a sex drive is.

591
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:05,548
- Meg.
- Honey, I'm just kidding.

592
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:08,134
But I do think sex is
like going to the gym.

593
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,805
You should do it every day and never use
the same equipment two days in a row.

594
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,934
I guess you're not the settling-down type.

595
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:19,604
The term "settling down,"
it just seems redundant to me.

596
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:20,730
And marriage?

597
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:25,610
It's not really a goal for me
like it is for most women.

598
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:29,239
If I found the right guy,
but that's a big if.

599
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:33,076
The right guy has to make me laugh
and be smarter than me.

600
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,662
Do you think love follows all those rules?

601
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,123
You could get swept off your feet, right?

602
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:42,794
Absolutely. By an incredibly smart
and really funny guy.

603
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:47,090
How did you two meet?

604
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:50,635
- Where do we start?
- College BFFs.

605
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,055
Yeah, we've known each other
and we go so far back.

606
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,890
And don't let this one fool you.

607
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:58,685
I wasn't always the wild one of the pair.

608
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,488
It's true. It's shocking, right?

609
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:15,160
This one, the wild one.
It's surprising, right?

610
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:18,705
No, not really.

611
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:25,462
When...

612
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:27,589
When Meg...

613
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,883
When I told her
I was moving back to Georgia,

614
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:32,427
she insisted on being
our real estate agent.

615
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:35,096
And just happened to own a house
down the street from me.

616
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,723
Which Jeffrey loved.

617
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:45,607
I was talking to Colin about where he lived,
but he wouldn't tell me where he lived.

618
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,651
Yeah, well, I don't blame him.

619
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:51,154
Colin just broke up with his fiancÃ©e.

620
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:53,490
It's been really tough for him.

621
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:58,203
Did you two know each other before tonight?

622
00:42:58,286 --> 00:42:59,329
- No.
- Yes.

623
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:01,331
- No.
- No.

624
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:10,382
Drink some more wine.

625
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:13,843
Oh, God.

626
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,181
A mother's work is never done.
You two behave yourselves.

627
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,642
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

628
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:32,153
- Are you going to behave yourself?
- I don't know, Colin.

629
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:34,781
Behave yourself.

630
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:38,368
I will.

631
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:52,549
Where can I smoke without getting wet?

632
00:43:55,844 --> 00:44:00,140
The garage should be good. It's just...
It's the door at the end of the hall.

633
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:42,974
Hey.

634
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:45,268
Can I get one of those?

635
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:51,107
Sure, there you go. You can have that one.

636
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:52,442
Thank you.

637
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:06,956
So, what's the deal?

638
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:08,917
What do you mean?

639
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,796
She's happily married.

640
00:45:12,962 --> 00:45:15,632
Well, I guess,
that depends on how you define happily.

641
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:18,885
What does that mean?

642
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:21,846
It means you just never know
what's going on behind closed doors.

643
00:45:21,971 --> 00:45:23,723
Is there something
going on between you two?

644
00:45:27,977 --> 00:45:29,896
Is there?

645
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,609
Are you serious?

646
00:45:37,028 --> 00:45:38,988
You two are having an affair?

647
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,956
I can't believe she didn't tell me.

648
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:50,458
You know, sometimes you like someone...

649
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,127
I don't... What?

650
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:54,546
You feel close to them.

651
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:57,716
But they don't feel the same way about you.

652
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:59,175
You know?

653
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:08,059
She hasn't told me because
she doesn't think we're very close anymore?

654
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:13,356
What are you saying?

655
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,525
You talked about this?

656
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:23,366
When I got here,
I didn't even know you were coming.

657
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:28,580
She didn't want you to find out.
Not this way.

658
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:33,501
I wrecked my car
and the first place I came was here.

659
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:35,795
Because I knew
Jeffrey wasn't going to be here.

660
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,808
Hey, Colin.

661
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:54,397
You're so full of shit.

662
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,652
- What?
- I said, "You're so full of shit."

663
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:02,655
Terry is my best friend.

664
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:07,619
I know everything about her,
and she knows everything about me.

665
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:11,581
So, there's no way she would ever
have an affair and not tell me.

666
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:14,084
It doesn't add up.

667
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:16,961
And, you know what else doesn't add up?
You don't add up.

668
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:20,965
And I'm going to find out
exactly what's going on.

669
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,301
Hey, Terry! Terry!

670
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:24,469
Hey!

671
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,752
- Where's Meg?
- She changed her mind.

672
00:47:58,044 --> 00:47:59,129
About?

673
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:02,048
Staying.

674
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:04,300
- She left?
- Yeah.

675
00:48:04,884 --> 00:48:06,845
Well, was she upset?

676
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:10,682
No. But I don't know her.

677
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:13,184
I'm going to call her.

678
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:20,150
So, you lied?

679
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:22,777
Excuse me?

680
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:25,780
About your husband. You lied.

681
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,993
So, where is he?

682
00:48:32,954 --> 00:48:35,248
He went on a golf trip with his father.

683
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:38,168
- A golf trip?
- Yeah.

684
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:42,005
I'm going to get some water. Are
you thirsty? Do you want anything?

685
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:43,089
No.

686
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:48,595
Yeah, I'm going to call Meg
and the tow truck, see if they're coming.

687
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,024
Are you sure she wasn't
upset when she left?

688
00:49:01,107 --> 00:49:02,108
Yeah.

689
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:06,905
But like I said, I don't know her.

690
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:33,515
Colin?

691
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,111
Colin?

692
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:05,505
Up again? Here we go.

693
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:08,967
- Here we go.
- Put her down!

694
00:50:09,342 --> 00:50:11,011
Hey, Mom.

695
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:14,681
- Do it again.
- Again? All right. Let's do it. Let's go.

696
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:16,433
And up! Touch the sky!

697
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:19,269
No, Ryan.

698
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:23,231
Ryan, baby, you have to go to bed, okay?
Please.

699
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,359
Ryan and I are just having some fun,
that's all. Aren't we, Ryan?

700
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:29,612
No. Ryan, come on, bugaboo.

701
00:50:29,654 --> 00:50:33,491
It's past your bedtime, sweetie. Okay?

702
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:35,535
Please.

703
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:38,955
Terry, is there something wrong?
Did I do something wrong?

704
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:43,335
Go to bed, sweetheart, okay?

705
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:45,420
What is this?

706
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:47,380
Who gave you this? No. Give it to me.

707
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:50,342
Ryan and I are friends. I wanted her
to have something real special, that's all.

708
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:51,509
Keep it.

709
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:56,639
Baby, go to sleep, okay?

710
00:50:56,723 --> 00:51:00,643
Mommy and her friend will be downstairs.
All right, sweetheart?

711
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:03,188
Okay, bugaboo.

712
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:05,065
Bye, Ryan.

713
00:51:08,276 --> 00:51:09,819
I'll see you later, okay?

714
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:15,575
Kids.

715
00:51:16,951 --> 00:51:18,578
They know, you know?

716
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:22,957
They have a real sense of
who's good, who's bad.

717
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:25,794
And your daughter, she has...

718
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,099
Okay.

719
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,853
Come on. Come on, get up.

720
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,192
Put the baby back down.

721
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:55,532
- Please.
- Put the baby back.

722
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:00,537
It's okay, baby. Just go back to sleep.

723
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:02,706
Everything's going to be okay, okay?

724
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:26,438
Don't you do anything stupid like
that again. Do you understand me?

725
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:28,523
- Yes.
- You do?

726
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,320
Come on. In the bathroom.

727
00:52:36,948 --> 00:52:39,451
Let's go. Come on!

728
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:44,539
Go on.

729
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:48,793
In the bathroom.

730
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:56,217
- Get in.
- What?

731
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:57,761
Get in.

732
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:00,638
Get in.

733
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,516
Stay right there.

734
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:06,496
Come on. Get out.

735
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:22,804
Turn the lights on.

736
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,394
- Are these your clothes?
- Yes.

737
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:32,313
- Right here?
- Yeah.

738
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:40,196
- Put those on.
- I'm fine.

739
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:43,783
Hey. Hey.

740
00:54:44,617 --> 00:54:47,037
Put those clothes on.

741
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,497
I'm not going to tell you again.

742
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,709
Go on.

743
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:12,896
Turn around.

744
00:55:15,106 --> 00:55:16,775
Stand up straight.

745
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:35,210
Please. Please.

746
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:37,379
Please, what?

747
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:42,133
You don't have to do this.

748
00:56:03,738 --> 00:56:05,281
Don't flatter yourself.

749
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:09,828
Put your clothes on.

750
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:15,834
- Fuck you.
- What did you say?

751
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:19,796
- I said, "Fuck you."
- I would be real careful if I were you.

752
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,214
You're not going to kill me.

753
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:24,300
If you were going to kill me,
you would have done that already.

754
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:28,221
Maybe, this is some sick fantasy

755
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:33,018
you're playing out against your
ex-girlfriend. What was it, your fiancÃ©e?

756
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:38,523
Or your sick mother. I don't know.
I don't care.

757
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:40,984
Can we just move it along?

758
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:44,988
Because I'm really getting sick
and tired of your sadistic bullshit.

759
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:48,992
Terry, I would have thought
with all those brains you've got, DA,

760
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:51,828
you would have figured out
the game we're playing by now.

761
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:55,165
- This is a game?
- It's all a game.

762
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:57,000
Yeah, well, I don't play, asshole.

763
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:58,835
Well, we're just getting to the fun part.

764
00:56:58,877 --> 00:57:01,588
Yeah, well, I'm sure the fun is long over.

765
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:21,024
Answer the phone.

766
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,780
Hello. Yes, there's an
intruder in my house.

767
00:57:26,863 --> 00:57:30,033
There's a crazy man in my house.
He's trying to kill me. 17 Creston Lane.

768
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:31,326
Please hurry!

769
00:57:31,993 --> 00:57:34,204
- Put that down!
- Okay. Okay.

770
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:43,880
Hey!

771
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,344
Hey! Hey, stop!

772
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:50,679
Please, Colin.

773
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:52,597
- I will shoot you!
- Okay.

774
00:57:53,014 --> 00:57:54,974
- Do you understand?
- Yes! Okay.

775
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:58,728
- I will shoot you!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

776
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:03,566
I called 911. The police are on their way.
It's over, Colin. Okay?

777
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,486
So, just leave, okay?
All you have to do is just leave.

778
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:09,155
Look. If you leave now,

779
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:11,574
you haven't hurt me,
you haven't hurt my family.

780
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:15,078
I don't have a reason to carry this on,
Colin, but you've got to go. Just go!

781
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:16,746
- Go get the kids.
- What do you mean?

782
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,470
You're absolutely right. We've got to go.

783
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:20,458
No. I will call the operator right now.

784
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:23,837
- Go get the kids.
- No, please. Please let...

785
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,840
- I'll go get them!
- No, I'll go! I'll get them.

786
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:27,674
I'll get them.

787
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:34,264
It's okay, baby. I know.

788
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:40,395
Go that way.

789
00:58:53,074 --> 00:58:55,201
Don't stop. Keep moving.

790
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,120
Keep moving.

791
00:58:58,788 --> 00:58:59,873
Come on, let's go.

792
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:04,169
Keep moving.

793
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:06,129
- Mommy.
- Get up!

794
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:11,968
Come on, get in the car. Let's go.

795
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,960
- Are you going to tell me where we're going?
- Just keep straight.

796
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:40,830
You don't look so good.

797
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:47,420
You lost a lot of blood.
You need to get to a hospital.

798
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:54,803
I need you to shut up.
Just keep driving straight.

799
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:01,518
Just keep driving.

800
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:06,856
Don't even think about it.

801
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:30,046
You know, when the cops get to my house
and see signs of struggle,

802
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:32,632
your blood all over my kitchen,

803
01:00:33,466 --> 01:00:37,387
and an empty house, they'll run my tags.

804
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,642
It's not too late.

805
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:45,311
If not a hospital,
I can take you somewhere, anywhere,

806
01:00:45,395 --> 01:00:49,899
but you can't stay in this car because they'll
eventually spot my tags and pull me over.

807
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:53,903
I'm not going to warn you again.
I need you to shut the hell up.

808
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:29,022
Shit.

809
01:01:40,658 --> 01:01:43,787
Shit. God damn it.

810
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,791
- What do you want me to do?
- Pull over.

811
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,293
Stay calm.

812
01:01:57,425 --> 01:01:59,052
- What are you doing?
- Get off me.

813
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:02,180
- No, no. Please. No.
- Come on.

814
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:03,682
No.

815
01:02:03,848 --> 01:02:05,968
It's just a little motivation
to keep your mouth shut.

816
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:08,259
I won't do anything, I promise.
Please put my baby back.

817
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:09,354
Just shut up!

818
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:13,316
I hope my APB hasn't crossed state lines.

819
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,401
Your what?

820
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,158
Just keep your mouth shut.

821
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,828
I ain't got nothing to lose.
You stand to lose it all.

822
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:25,995
I won't do anything, I promise.

823
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,599
- Please put him down.
- Just be smart.

824
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,670
License and registration, please.

825
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:35,380
- Mommy?
- Okay.

826
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:40,635
- Mommy.
- Everything's okay, baby.

827
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:43,763
Your baby needs to be in a car seat.

828
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:48,351
He was, he was,
but we took him out just as we stopped.

829
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:50,228
He was crying. He's gone to sleep now.

830
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:53,189
Mommy.

831
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,359
- What happened to your head?
- What now?

832
01:02:56,526 --> 01:02:58,278
Your head. What happened to it?

833
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:02,407
I was fixing the windows in the storm,
but it fought back.

834
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:04,034
Mommy.

835
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:05,910
Right back.

836
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:10,790
- Is everything all right, Officer?
- Mommy, where is Daddy?

837
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,793
I want to go home.

838
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:21,015
Ma'am, could you step
out of the car, please?

839
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:50,413
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

840
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:54,250
Were you trying to signal me
with your headlights back there?

841
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:57,170
You flashed your brights at me back there.

842
01:03:58,546 --> 01:03:59,547
Ma'am.

843
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:03,551
No, I...

844
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,764
I was reaching for the radio

845
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:11,559
and my hand must have slipped
and hit the brights.

846
01:04:13,395 --> 01:04:16,898
Honestly, it wouldn't be the first time.
I'm really sorry.

847
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:21,194
Who's the man in the car with you?

848
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:26,282
The man in the car?

849
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,577
Who is he?

850
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:32,872
Well, Officer,

851
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:36,668
it's kind of embarrassing.

852
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:40,380
My husband,

853
01:04:43,174 --> 01:04:45,385
he's out of town.

854
01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:50,932
And you must think I'm awful.

855
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:53,309
Look, lady, it's none of my business.

856
01:04:53,351 --> 01:04:57,022
But you might do whatever
you're doing without the kids around.

857
01:04:57,188 --> 01:05:00,108
- Do you know what I'm saying?
- Yes, Officer. I'm really sorry.

858
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:04,154
Are you sure everything's all right?
You keep looking back at the car.

859
01:05:04,237 --> 01:05:05,905
Is there something you need to tell me?

860
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:14,456
I can't say anything right now.

861
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:20,170
All right, ma'am. Have a nice night.

862
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:21,463
Don't move.

863
01:05:23,548 --> 01:05:25,008
Stay right there!

864
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:30,555
Get over here! Right here.

865
01:05:34,851 --> 01:05:38,021
He could have been alive
if it wasn't for you.

866
01:05:48,531 --> 01:05:49,532
It's your fault!

867
01:05:49,616 --> 01:05:52,035
I tell you to do something, you do it.
Do you understand me?

868
01:05:52,118 --> 01:05:54,245
- I will kill you. Do you understand me?
- Yes.

869
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:55,663
- Do you understand me?
- Yes!

870
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,501
Go on and get in the car. Get around there.

871
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:03,755
You're at my mercy. Do you understand me?
You are going to do exactly as you're told.

872
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:06,883
Get in the car. Let's go.

873
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:34,661
Why are you doing this?

874
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:38,581
You'll see.

875
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:45,422
Pull in here.

876
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:49,342
This house right here. Pull in.

877
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:51,970
There you go.

878
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:56,808
Pull straight in. And I want you
to back up on the side right here.

879
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:03,440
Back it up a little bit. That's right.

880
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,192
Keep going.

881
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:09,946
That's good.

882
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:13,783
Grab the kids, let's go.

883
01:07:20,957 --> 01:07:23,793
Go on. Put the kids in here.

884
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:37,140
We're just going to have a
little sleepover, okay, baby?

885
01:07:39,476 --> 01:07:41,478
- Listen.
- Come on.

886
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,816
I love you.

887
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:52,781
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up. Go on.

888
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:57,160
Through the door right there. Come on.

889
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:04,834
I want you to go in that bathroom
over there. Find a first aid kit.

890
01:08:05,752 --> 01:08:08,672
Patch me up. Come on.

891
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:15,845
- I don't know where a first aid kit is.
- Just keep looking.

892
01:08:16,137 --> 01:08:18,264
There's something in there.

893
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:31,569
Terry, meet Alexis.

894
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:34,406
Alexis, Terry.

895
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:39,202
You should have seen the look on her face.

896
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,040
Life draining from her eyes.

897
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:49,462
And after all I did for her.

898
01:08:53,049 --> 01:08:54,634
Come on, what have you got?

899
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:00,765
Give me the key.

900
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:02,209
- Give me the key. Come on!
- Okay.

901
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:09,941
Shit!

902
01:09:14,237 --> 01:09:16,197
- Come here. Get on your knees.
- Why?

903
01:09:16,364 --> 01:09:18,484
On your knees. Take your coat off.
Take your coat off.

904
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:22,203
There you go.
Put your hands behind your back. Now.

905
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:23,371
There you go.

906
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:25,248
You stay right here.

907
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:30,337
I don't want you running around. Right
here. Stay right there. Legs out.

908
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:36,009
- Please don't.
- Shut up. Just shut up.

909
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:38,154
- Hello? Hello?<i>
- Finally, babe.</i>

910
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:39,989
<i>I'm at the hotel. I've been here all night.</i>

911
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:41,871
<i>I left you, like, five messages.
Where are you?</i>

912
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,537
- Jeffrey?<i>
- Alexis.</i>

913
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,581
<i>Alexis?</i>

914
01:10:51,584 --> 01:10:53,086
<i>Alexis?</i>

915
01:10:57,132 --> 01:11:00,468
<i>"Didn't want to wake you,
'cause you looked so beautiful sleeping."</i>

916
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:02,679
<i>- 17...
- 17 Creston Lane.</i>

917
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:03,805
<i>- ...Creston.
- Lane.</i>

918
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:04,848
<i>Lane.</i>

919
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:07,058
Oh, my God.

920
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,813
<i>Alexis? I'm at the hotel.</i>

921
01:11:12,647 --> 01:11:14,190
She's dead, Jeffrey.

922
01:11:15,066 --> 01:11:18,028
- Your goddamn girlfriend is dead.<i>
- Terry.</i>

923
01:11:18,153 --> 01:11:19,513
- Call the police.<i>
- Wait a minute.</i>

924
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:23,074
Jeffrey, call the goddamn police.

925
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:31,416
<i>You've reached 911 emergency response.</i>

926
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,919
<i>We are receiving
a high volume of calls in this area.</i>

927
01:11:39,257 --> 01:11:41,092
Ryan, baby. Come on.

928
01:12:05,575 --> 01:12:06,701
Come on.

929
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:14,584
Shit!

930
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:04,384
Okay, Ryan.
I need you to stay right here, okay?

931
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:06,507
Be very quiet
and wait for Mommy to come back, okay?

932
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,272
- You bitch!
- Jeffrey called!

933
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:05,482
What?

934
01:16:05,523 --> 01:16:08,360
Jeffrey called. He's on his way.
I know why you killed her.

935
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:10,331
The affair she was having with my husband.

936
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:12,614
- Where is he?
- This is about getting revenge with Jeffrey.

937
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:14,074
- Where is he?
- Mommy.

938
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:17,660
Run, Ryan, run!

939
01:16:22,999 --> 01:16:24,959
- Where are you going? Come here.
- Get off of me.

940
01:18:14,986 --> 01:18:17,655
- Excuse me. What's your business?
- I'm sorry, sir. You can't go in there.

941
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:19,491
- That's my... Terry! Terry!
- Hold up.

942
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,785
Terry.

943
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:23,787
Terry.

944
01:18:34,714 --> 01:18:38,009
Baby, I'm sorry.

945
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:42,180
Listen to me.

946
01:18:43,556 --> 01:18:45,600
It's not what you think.

947
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:48,478
It didn't mean anything to me.

948
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:50,855
Baby.

949
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:53,149
Terry, it didn't mean...

950
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:45,201
Great. That goes on the first level.
Thanks.

951
01:19:47,662 --> 01:19:49,789
So, it looks like
you'll be right at home in there.

952
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:51,124
It's perfect.

953
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:53,247
If you have any questions,
you know how to reach me.

954
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:56,755
Everything is going to be great.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

955
01:20:08,516 --> 01:20:10,226
Come on, Ryan.

956
01:20:11,686 --> 01:20:13,563
- Are you taking them to the park?
- Yeah.

957
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:16,816
Great. I'll walk over
on my way to the court house.

958
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,652
Come on, baby.
How do you like the house, bugaboo?
