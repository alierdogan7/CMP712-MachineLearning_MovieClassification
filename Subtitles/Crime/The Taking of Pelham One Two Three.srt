1
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,039
OK, kid, out loud now,
so as l can hear you.

2
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,277
I'm checkin' the passengers,
front and back.

3
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,076
Shuttin' the doors. Rear section first.
Then the front section.

4
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,796
And the doors are closed. I'm checkin'
indicators to make sure doors are locked.

5
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,755
I remove my key, go back out the window
to make sure no one's bein' dragged.

6
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,396
51st Street next stop.
Next stop, 51st Street.

7
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,756
How'd l do?

8
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,711
Now you take my advice, kid.

9
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,038
You serve your six months, and
then you put in for the motorman.

10
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,515
Watch it now, we're comin' in.

11
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,030
- 59th Street.
- No, it ain't.

12
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,277
51st Street.
Sorry, this station is 51st Street.

13
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,038
Never say you're sorry.

14
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,709
Someone may come back here
and hit you in your damn nose!

15
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,072
Grand Central Station next stop.
Next stop, Grand Central.

16
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,909
If l was you l'd start studyin' for
that motorman exam right now.

17
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,192
Tell you the truth, Mr Mattson,
l have been.

18
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,357
Every car in the IRT is 72 feet long.

19
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,677
Costs $1 50,000, weighs 75,000lbs.

20
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,073
This is where l get off. You're doin' fine.

21
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,519
Yeah, l'll see ya.

22
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,599
Hey, what's the rush, chief?
We ain't gonna leave without ya!

23
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,992
33rd Street next stop. Next stop is 33rd.

24
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,199
What's wrong, dude?
Ain't you never seen a sunset before?

25
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,713
Hey! How am l supposed
to see with you...?

26
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,397
- Holy God! What do you want?
- I'm taking your train.

27
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,237
You're takin' my train?

28
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,310
Hey!

29
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,749
Turn around.
I got s-s-somethin' to show ya.

30
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,711
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!

31
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,113
I won't tell you again. Open the door
or l'll blow your head off.

32
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,036
May l get by, please?

33
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,720
No, you don't wanna go in there.

34
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,990
Suppose l do anyway?

35
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,634
Then l'll shoot your pee-pee off.

36
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,158
Now just go back out the window
and tell me what you see.

37
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,996
Someone leanin' against the head car.

38
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,999
The second he comes aboard,
you sh-sh-shut the doors.

39
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,038
Keep your hand off
the microphone, buddy.

40
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,391
- All right, Mr Green?
- 100 per cent, Mr Blue.

41
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,476
Get moving, will you?

42
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,629
Oh!

43
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,196
Shelley, give that to the meathead
upstairs, will ya?

44
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,629
(secretary) Right this way. Just follow me.

45
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,832
Shelley, have you seen
Lieutenant Garber?

46
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,873
Oh! Lieutenant, it's so nice of you
to leave your duties long enough

47
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,197
to escort our distinguished
guests around the facilities.

48
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,754
May l present to you Mr Yashimura.

49
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,670
Mr Matsumoto.

50
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,596
Mr Tomashita.

51
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,633
And Mr Naka... Nakabashi?

52
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,592
These gentlemen are all directors of
the Tokyo Metropolitan Subway System.

53
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,357
Gentlemen, l'd like you to meet
Lieutenant Zachary Garber

54
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,153
of our own New York
Transit Authority Police.

55
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,236
A pleasure, gentlemen.

56
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,270
When you're finished, send them up to 1 3.

57
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,278
The chairman would like to say
goodbye to them personally.

58
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,356
Sayonara!

59
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,959
Follow me, gentlemen. New York City
Subway is the largest in the world,

60
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,436
with 237 miles of track, 7,000...

61
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,992
Gentlemen, please. New York City
Subway is the largest in the world.

62
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,317
7,000 cars, 237 miles of track...

63
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,950
- Say "when", Mr Blue.
- You just keep going, will you?

64
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,833
You're still in switchin'. Why don't you
peg it up? You're green all the way.

65
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,315
We're in no hurry. Atchoo!

66
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,795
Your cold sounds pretty bad.

67
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,480
I woke up in the middle
of the night with it.

68
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,433
- What happened?
- Must've bucked.

69
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,835
You told me you could drive this thing.

70
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,191
It's the train. She bucks
all the time. She's a dog.

71
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,358
This is the headquarters
of the Transit Police,

72
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,029
which occupies the entire
second floor of this building.

73
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,276
We call it the nerve centre.

74
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,233
The status board pinpoints the disposition

75
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,319
of every Transit Authority patrolman
presently in the field.

76
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,480
That's it. Get a good shot of that.

77
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,356
Things are usually jumpin'
pretty good in here.

78
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,389
I suppose you gentlemen have your share
of crime in the Tokyo subways, right?

79
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,315
Right? Well, that's the way it goes.

80
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,275
These are the assignment desks. One
for each of the lines: the BMT, the IRT,

81
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,152
the IND.

82
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,236
There's our artist in residence.

83
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,353
And right through here is our operations
lieutenant, Mr Rico Patrone,

84
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,596
who, on weekends, works for the Mafia.

85
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,190
Rico, l'd like you to meet some
good friends of the chairman.

86
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,073
- Hiya.
- Very good friends, Rico.

87
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,349
Hiya.

88
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,519
Rico, these are the directors
of the Tokyo subway.

89
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,755
Tell us about some of the excitin' things

90
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,634
that have happened in the New York City
Subway System lately, Rico.

91
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,070
Well, we had a bomb scare
in the Bronx yesterday.

92
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,760
But it turned out to be a cantaloupe.

93
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,115
I'm busy, Zach, OK?

94
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,638
In the course of a normal week,

95
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,118
the average TA policeman deals with
such crimes as robbery, assault,

96
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,198
murder, drunkenness,

97
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,993
illness, vandalism,

98
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,553
mishegaas,

99
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,468
abusiveness, sexual molestation,

100
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,794
exhibitionism...

101
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,640
- What's your name, motorman?
- Denny Doyle, sir.

102
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,716
- Ever been written up?
- Once.

103
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,593
- What for?
- Runnin' a red signal. How about you?

104
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,553
Twice. Once on the Canarsie...

105
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,832
That's right, Mr Green. Tell Mr Doyle
all about yourself, will you?

106
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,951
OK. Stop it about here.

107
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,557
I'm takin' your brake handle
and the reverse key, Denny.

108
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,749
Atchoo!

109
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,235
I want your cuttin' key also.

110
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,876
That's it.

111
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,159
You'll hear from Command Centre
in a minute or two.

112
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,078
You will ignore the call.
Is that clear, Mr Doyle?

113
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,634
Yes, sir. They can call
all they want. I'm deaf.

114
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,551
- Thanks, Mr Grey.
- Don't mention it, uh... Mr Green, right?

115
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,150
Right. Let's have your cab key, conductor.

116
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,555
I can't do that. I ain't supposed to do that.

117
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,798
You got three seconds
to live, conductor. One, two...

118
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,876
OK, OK, OK.

119
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,029
It'll mean my job.
What's he gonna do?

120
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,073
You wouldn't want me to spoil
the s-s-surprise, would you?

121
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,637
until then, stay where you are.
Go back to normal speed when...

122
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,119
Command Centre callin' Pelham
One Two Three. Come in, please.

123
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,390
Sorry, l couldn't help it. It was automatic.

124
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,715
Pelham One Two Three, do you read me?

125
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,876
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

126
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,476
Where the fuck are you?

127
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,273
Hey! What's the goddamn hurry?

128
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,075
I told you, one of my men dropped
his weddin' ring down the john!

129
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,998
- What are you runnin' for?
- Who's runnin'?

130
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,030
- How come that gate ain't locked?
- Who's gonna steal a subway train?

131
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,390
Grand Central Tower
callin' Command Centre.

132
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,193
Have you picked up on
Pelham One Two Three yet?

133
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,992
We're tryin' to find out.

134
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,237
- What'd he say?
- They're backed up all along the line.

135
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,397
Jesus Christ, Caz, you picked
a hell of a day to be late!

136
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,715
You wanted a plumber
down here, didn't ya?

137
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,310
- Whose goddamn weddin' ring was it?
- Mrs Jenkins'. But, Caz...

138
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,670
Sorry, Mr Dolowicz. It just slipped off.

139
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,156
- Why was your hand in the john anyway?
- My hand wasn't...

140
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,238
Go fish it out, would ya?
The toilet's behind the board.

141
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,669
Caz, listen to me! There's a train down!

142
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,633
Classification's been open
to a woman for only a month

143
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,399
and already we're in a goddamn toilet!

144
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,914
- What the hell's that?
- Marino's been tryin' to tell ya.

145
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,315
He's layin' down between 28th and 23rd.

146
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,035
- What the hell for? How long?
- Three minutes.

147
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,755
Command Centre's been tryin' to raise
him, but he don't answer his phone.

148
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,917
Jeez, Caz, why don't he answer his radio?

149
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,792
Maybe his radio's busted

150
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,310
and the son of a bitch is too lazy
to climb down and use the phone.

151
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,591
I'm gonna write him up for this!
l'm gonna have his ass!

152
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,998
Hey, it's movin'.

153
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,079
For Jesus Christ's sake,
the dumb bastard is movin' backwards.

154
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,270
Look. He left the front car behind.

155
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,392
The goddamn board must be busted.

156
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,833
He stopped again.

157
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,118
Well, stopped is better
than backwards at least.

158
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,352
What was that? l didn't know
these things went backwards.

159
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,118
Now you know.

160
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,717
Would you mind tellin' me
what you gentlemen are doing?

161
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,796
Yeah, l would.

162
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,636
(children laughing)

163
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,995
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.
Come in.

164
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,509
- All right, Mr Green?
- Smooth as silk, Mr Blue.

165
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,232
- How do you feel?
- Great.

166
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,634
Get out, Doyle.

167
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,275
Here's your gun. Get going.
We're already two minutes late.

168
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,836
Pelham One Two Three.
Do you hear me, Pelham One Two Three?

169
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,717
Look. The front car's movin'.
And forward this time.

170
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,389
- I've got eyes, haven't l?
- What's goin' on down there?

171
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,996
Are you children with anybody?

172
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,395
You children... you with anybody?

173
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,476
Yeah. My mother.

174
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,158
Go back and join her.

175
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,999
- Why?
- Go back and join your mother.

176
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,076
Mom, we wanna play.

177
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,477
Your attention, please.

178
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,155
You'll all remain seated. Anybody
who tries to rise is going to get shot.

179
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,471
There's another one!

180
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,238
Shut up!

181
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,316
Move up a bit, Mr Doyle.

182
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,030
Ladies and gentlemen, you see this gun?

183
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,516
It fires 750 rounds of 9-millimetre
ammunition per minute.

184
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,679
In other words, if all of you
simultaneously were to rush me,

185
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,759
not a single one of you would get
any closer than you are right now.

186
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,677
Mom, are those real guns?

187
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,233
I do hope l have made myself understood.

188
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,635
(Spanish)

189
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,918
He stopped again. The crazy dumb-ass
son of a bitch stopped again.

190
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,076
He's halfway between stations!

191
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,590
I'm gonna nail his pecker
to the goddamn wall for this.

192
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,280
- Caz, take it easy, will ya?
- Come on!

193
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,234
If l gotta watch my language because
they let a few broads in, l'm gonna quit!

194
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,238
How can you run a goddamn railroad
without swearin'?!

195
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,557
Grand Central Terminal,
who's in charge down there?

196
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,830
It's for you, Mr Dolowicz.

197
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,749
It's me, Frank. Caz Dolowicz.
We're watchin' it on the board.

198
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,440
Watchin' it?!
l got trains pilin' up behind it!

199
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,439
- Get some supervision down there!
- It's on its way, Frank.

200
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,435
I'll be back.

201
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,675
I've turned off the power.

202
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,509
Everybody in this part of the car,
move to the back.

203
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,918
Come on. Everybody in the front part
of the car move to the back.

204
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,355
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Move back, please, and sit down.

205
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,953
(woman) May l say something, please?

206
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,554
- Please, listen to me...
- Be quiet and sit down!

207
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,116
Let's go, honey.

208
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,596
All right, Mr Doyle.

209
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,076
What are you gonna do?

210
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,189
- What about this one?
- Let her sleep.

211
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,993
What you're going to do, Mr Doyle,
is to go back,

212
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,317
collect all the passengers
from the cars we've cut loose,

213
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,477
and walk them to 28th Street station.

214
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,990
- People hate to get off in a tunnel...
- Just do as you're told.

215
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,437
Excuse me.

216
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,838
Excuse me. Can l go with him? l got
this very important appointment to see.

217
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,916
Nobody else leaves.

218
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,874
Aw, shit.

219
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,197
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
if the children were to go.

220
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,199
Sit down, madam. Didn't you hear
what l said? l said nobody else leaves.

221
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,359
Excuse me, mister. Don't you think
we should be let in on what's happening?

222
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,270
You're being held by four very dangerous
men armed with machine guns.

223
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,038
Ask a foolish question...

224
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,513
(cries ofdismay)

225
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,119
Be quiet.

226
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,869
Be quiet! Nothing will happen
as long as you obey my orders.

227
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,198
That's what they said in Vietnam,
and l still got my ass shot full of lead.

228
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,072
Shut your mouth, nigger!

229
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,188
- And keep it shut.
- Mr Grey!

230
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,271
(woman praying in Spanish)

231
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,956
It's terrible.

232
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,556
Who asked you to look?

233
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,632
All right, Mr Green?

234
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,479
The power's off at 14th Street and 33rd.

235
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,639
All four tracks. Local and express.

236
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,796
The north and the southbound.

237
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,672
Why am l still seeing lights?

238
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,553
That's emergency.
They run on AC like the signals.

239
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,556
Atchoo!

240
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,318
- Stop that, will you?
- Sorry.

241
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,237
Command Centre calling Pelham.

242
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,593
Did you cut off the power down there?
Without callin' to explain? Listen to me.

243
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,238
You've screwed up the
whole subway system.

244
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,754
Gentlemen, this is
the TA Command Centre.

245
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,110
A lot of laughs in here. Terrific place.

246
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,870
Each train is identified by the name of
its terminus and the time of its departure.

247
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,472
Thus an express train leavin' Woodlawn
at 6.30pm would be Woodlawn 6-3-0.

248
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,993
While on its return trip its destination
might be... Iet's say Flatbush 8-2-5.

249
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,432
- I hope you're memorisin' all this junk.
- Garber, what's the matter with you?

250
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,755
Don't worry.
They don't understand English.

251
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,235
This way, dummies.
Step this way, dummies.

252
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,276
Over here is Frank Correll, the Lord Byron
of the New York City Subway System.

253
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,073
Observe the way fire and smoke
shoot out of his ears.

254
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,589
Don't bug me, Garber. I got troubles here.

255
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,633
A train is down, its radio's dead,
the power's off, and it's dumped its load.

256
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,557
Aside from that, it's ginger-peachy.

257
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,511
What time is it, Mr Green?

258
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,437
uh...

259
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,551
2.10.

260
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,957
Right. Time to talk to them.

261
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,518
- Is something troubling you?
- I think l'm gonna die today.

262
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,471
That's entirely possible.

263
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,869
This is Pelham One Two Three
to Command Centre.

264
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,709
This is Pelham One Two Three to
Command Centre. Do you read me?

265
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,274
OK, we'll leave him alone to his problems.

266
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,029
What are you tryin' to do?
Screw up this entire railroad?

267
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,869
- I want an explanation! lt better be good!
- Your train has been taken.

268
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,233
- What?
- Repeat, your train has been taken.

269
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,113
Hey, shut up in here! Shut up!

270
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,276
I said shut it, everybody!

271
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,914
Shut it up, everybody, goddamnit!

272
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,477
The train has been taken?

273
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,477
- Are you the motorman?
- Negative.

274
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,071
Nobody's authorised to be in that cab
except the motorman. Identify yourself.

275
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,669
Your locomotive has been hijacked
by a group of heavily armed men.

276
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,399
It what?

277
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,911
We are holding 17 passengers and
the conductor hostage in the first car.

278
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,553
I am quite prepared to kill any
or all ofthem

279
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,114
ifyou do not obey my commands
to the letter.

280
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,199
- Have l made myselfquite clear?
- You're outta your skull!

281
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,108
Be that as it may, get out a pen,
take down our list ofdemands.

282
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,113
Hey, now wait a minute.
Hold on. Stand by.

283
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,879
Why would anybody hijack
a goddamn subway train?

284
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,436
Hit your six button, Frank.
I want the TA police in on this.

285
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,028
What are all these Chinamen
doin' in here?

286
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,593
Holy Christ, l forgot.

287
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,109
Charlie, take these monkeys up to 1 3.

288
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,314
It is all right, Lieutenant Garber.
I am sure we can find it by ourselves.

289
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,353
Thank you for a most
instructive visit, Lieutenant.

290
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,313
A most exciting tour, Lieutenant.
Most exciting.

291
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,396
Most exciting.

292
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,076
Garber to Patrone. Garber to Patrone.

293
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,956
Come in, Patrone.

294
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,719
This is Patrone.

295
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,277
Rico, l want you to plug everythin' you got
into the IRT train master's circuit.

296
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,550
And all units stand by on the double.

297
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,514
Call in the City cops. Put it on a 91 1
so their computer gets it.

298
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,073
What's up, Z?

299
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,873
- You won't believe it.
- I'll believe anythin'.

300
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,434
A train's been hijacked.

301
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,316
I don't believe it.

302
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,478
When did the power go?

303
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,478
- Conductor, when did the power go?
- Who wants to know?

304
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,876
Me! The supervisor of the Grand
Central Tower wants to know!

305
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,709
Oh, yes, sir! A couple of minutes ago!
Hey, what happened down there?

306
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,235
Who wants to know!

307
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,799
No, nobody's hurt!

308
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,673
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know what's goin' on!

309
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,916
- What happened?
- Nothin' happened, lady.

310
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,758
- Anybody killed?
- Nobody's killed.

311
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,436
On the left now, watch out for
the third rail. On the left now.

312
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,913
What the hell is this, for Christ's sake?

313
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,473
Your attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

314
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,639
I'm sure the more intelligent of you
have worked out you're all hostages.

315
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,716
Oh, my God!

316
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,036
Isn't that wonderful(!)

317
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,079
- Hostages.
- What did you think? Guests?

318
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,794
When we get what we want,
you'll be released unharmed.

319
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,310
until then, you'll continue to do
precisely as you're told.

320
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,636
(Spanish)

321
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,872
Excuse me, sir. What's going to happen
to us if you don't get what you want?

322
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,279
Excuse me, sir. We are going
to get what we want.

323
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,270
I don't give a damn
what they were armed with.

324
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,391
They were gonna kill me!

325
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,230
You're like the captain of the ship!
You're supposed to go down with it!

326
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,874
- Horseshit!
- Oh, lady, butt out!

327
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,630
Tell Command Centre
l'll be on my way to investigate!

328
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,672
(Denny) l wouldn't go
down there if l was you!

329
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,756
I know you wouldn't!

330
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,988
You work for the subway, mister? Tell 'em
l'm gonna sue! l'm gonna sue their ass off!

331
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,076
(shouting)

332
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,637
Pelham One Two Three
to Command Centre.

333
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,112
Are you ready to take down
our list ofdemands?

334
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,196
What do you want?

335
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,675
- Do you have your pen?
- Go on, for Pete's sake!

336
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,435
It's important you understand
three things.

337
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,677
1 ) Pelham One Two Three is
completely within our control.

338
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,234
2) We are all armed with
automatic weapons.

339
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,874
3) We have no scruples about killing.

340
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,039
- Do you understand me so far?
- I understand you fine, you lunatic.

341
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,552
Inform the mayor that we demand
one million dollars cash

342
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,353
for the release ofthe car
and all the hostages.

343
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,756
- That'll be the day.
- The time is now 2. 13.

344
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,679
The money must be in our hands
not later than 3. 13.

345
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,313
One hour from now.

346
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,070
If the money is not in our hands, we'll kill
one hostage for every minute you're late.

347
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,953
Keep dreamin', maniac.

348
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,550
Ifanybody attempts to interfere
- anyone, in any way -

349
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,399
we will begin killing the hostages
immediately.

350
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,395
Confirm, please.

351
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,112
Zach! Zach!

352
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,676
- Pelham One Two Three, come in, please.
- This is Pelham.

353
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,036
Identify yourself, please.

354
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,359
This is Lieutenant Zachary Garber of the
Transit Police. Identify yourself, please.

355
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,357
I'm the man who stole your train.

356
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,632
Sir, there is no way you can get away with
this. You are underground in a tunnel.

357
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,671
Why concern yourself with that?

358
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,636
At precisely 3.1 3 we are going
to begin executing the hostages.

359
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,354
You'd better contact the mayor
and get back to me

360
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,233
for my further instructions.
Over and out.

361
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,238
Son of a bitch has got me backed up
all the way to the Bronx!

362
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,669
What is this, a circus?
Let's get back to work!

363
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,279
Rico, did you get that?

364
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,631
I only got your end of it,
but l could piece it together. It's crazy.

365
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,958
The guy's got a heavy English accent.
He could be a fruitcake.

366
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,036
We got anybody at 28th Street?

367
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,153
Just checkin' it out.
Yeah, he's around there somewhere.

368
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,829
Tell him to hold the fort. Could be
all day before the City cops show up.

369
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,155
They're never around when you need 'em.

370
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,078
Lex 28. Lex 28. Come in, please.

371
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,155
Patrolman James.

372
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,158
This is Lieutenant Patrone.
Where are you?

373
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,872
28th Street, southbound.

374
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,630
Look, Lieutenant, everything's cooled out.
Nothing's happenin'. What's goin' on?

375
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,957
Look, don't react to this,
but a train's been hijacked.

376
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,473
- Holy shit.
- For God's sake, don't say anythin'.

377
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,717
There's a supervisor from
Grand Central Tower.

378
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,594
Yeah, l saw him a few minutes ago.
He went down the track on foot.

379
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,109
Go after him.
See if you can turn him back.

380
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,798
Yes, sir.

381
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,156
All l know is l am the goddamn mayor
of the goddamn city of New York,

382
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,909
the second most important
elective office in the entire country,

383
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,318
and you tell me l gotta lay here and suffer
like every other schlub in the country?

384
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,911
I'm sorry you have the flu, Mr Mayor.
There's nothing more l can do.

385
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,271
There's one more thing. Get out!

386
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,356
You can't fight City Hall.

387
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,916
(game show on TV)

388
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,190
(phone rings)

389
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,828
Yeah?

390
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,509
Al, it's Warren. I'm comin' upstairs.
I got a real bitch on our hands.

391
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,200
Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

392
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,676
- I'm comin' up.
- Can't you handle it, Warren?

393
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,678
You are the goddamn
deputy mayor of the city of...

394
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,679
Sure l can handle it. Like l handle
every other filthy, stinkin'job

395
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,678
in this whole miserable city,
but l'm not gonna do it.

396
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,791
What is it? Another strike?

397
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,878
All right, all right.
I can take another strike.

398
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,878
A gang ofmen has hijacked
a subway train.

399
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,472
A gang of men...?

400
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,718
Has hijacked a subway train.
They want a million dollars for it.

401
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,356
Come on up.

402
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,909
Couple number one are the winners
oftoday's newlywed game!

403
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,799
Missed it!

404
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,951
What do you want, Mr Green?

405
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,957
Is everythin' OK?

406
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,232
Go and sit down. I do not want Mr Grey
and Mr Brown alone with the passengers.

407
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,999
- Don't you trust them?
- I trust Mr Brown.

408
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,515
I do not trust Mr Grey.

409
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,474
I think that Mr Grey is an enormous
arrogant pain in the arse

410
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,477
who could turn out to be trouble.

411
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,876
I also think that he is mad.

412
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,877
Why do you think
they threw him out of the Mafia?

413
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,956
Ohh, terrific.

414
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,873
- Hold it right there, cowboy!
- (Caz) Who are you?!

415
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,833
(Mr Grey) You'll find out
if you take another step!

416
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,556
I'm warnin' ya, mister! That's City
property you're foolin' around with!

417
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,473
That's just too fuckin' bad!

418
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,070
Why don't you go grab a goddamn
aeroplane like everybody else?

419
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,590
Cos we're afraid of flyin'!
Clear out or l'll shoot your ass off!

420
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,234
The hell with you! l'm comin' on board!

421
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,756
I warned you, stupid!

422
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,156
(hostages screaming)

423
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,476
Holy shit!

424
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,393
I warned the bastard,
but he kept on comin' anyway.

425
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,478
- Was he alone?
- I didn't see nobody else.

426
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,510
Mr Brown.

427
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,518
I guess l got us on the scoreboard, right?

428
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,357
Take over from Mr Grey.

429
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,950
- A little quick with that gun.
- The jerk was comin' on board!

430
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,718
Loved every minute of it.

431
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,037
- Keep those children quiet.
- I'm trying! l can't!

432
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,152
- Do you want me to try?
- Oh, my God! No!

433
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,471
You said nobody was gonna get hurt.

434
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,631
Patrolman James callin' Operations.

435
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,478
This is Patrone.
Did you find that supervisor?

436
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,070
- He's dead, Lieutenant.
- Speak up, will ya? l can't hear ya.

437
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,352
I can't. I'm only 20 yards away
from the hijacked train.

438
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,677
They just shot him with a machine gun.

439
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,756
Is he dead?

440
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,551
- Wouldn't you be, Lieutenant?
- Stay put and keep an eye on things.

441
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,110
Z! They just drew first blood.

442
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,916
That supervisor from Grand Central
Tower. Theyjust killed him.

443
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,350
Oh, my God. Thanks, Rico.

444
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,119
Frank, do you know who went
to 28th from Grand Central?

445
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,710
- Caz Dolowicz. Why?
- Jeez. I knew him.

446
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,556
Hey, whaddaya mean, you knew him?

447
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,875
They just shot him.

448
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,353
Dead?

449
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,359
- Caz? Fat Caz?
- Yeah.

450
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,354
- Garber?
- Aw, shit!

451
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,355
Garber? Are you there, Zach?

452
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,156
- Yeah, who is this?
- Costello.

453
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,156
Yes, Captain.

454
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,556
I'm puttin' you in charge at this end.
I'm goin' to headquarters.

455
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,672
Ifl don't show up,
the City cops'll hog all the action.

456
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,439
There's one on board the train.
One ofthe hostages.

457
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,358
You're kiddin'. A cop on the train?
How do you know?

458
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,752
There were two, but one got offat 33rd
and called in later when the news got out.

459
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,348
That means the other one's
still on the train.

460
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,119
- Plainclothes?
- Yeah, Tactical Force.

461
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,074
- Man or woman?
- I never even thought to ask.

462
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,159
Well, doesn't make any difference.
They can't do much single-handed.

463
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,590
Warren, l thought it over.
I know what we're gonna do.

464
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,596
Tell me.

465
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,473
We're gonna let 'em keep
the goddamn subway train.

466
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,273
We got plenty of them.
We'll never even miss it.

467
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,994
How about the 18 hostages?
We gonna miss them?

468
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,954
Warren, goddamnit!
This city hasn't got a million dollars!

469
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,868
Empty one of your Swiss bank accounts.
There's no other way out.

470
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,560
- Don't we get to think about it?
- There's no time.

471
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,956
I still want the full picture.
Get me the police commissioner,

472
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,959
the chairman of the Transit Authority,
and that putz we got for a comptroller.

473
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,958
They're on their way,
but it's no good runnin' to them, Al.

474
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,753
You're the mayor.
The buck stops with you.

475
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,872
- Oh, shit.
- God help us.

476
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,276
Shit! Piss! Fuck!

477
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,554
Call Charlie. Tell him
l'll get to him as soon as l can.

478
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,318
Where's that list on 144?

479
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,749
Command Centre callin'
Pelham One Two Three.

480
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,677
Frank, you're hoggin' my circuits.

481
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,155
I've got motormen callin' me from all over!

482
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,352
Tell 'em to get off the air.
I need some more lines open.

483
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,234
So talkin' to murderers takes priority
over runnin' a railroad?

484
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,352
My only priority is savin'
the lives of these passengers.

485
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,439
Screw the passengers! What do they
expect for 35 cents? To live for ever?

486
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,471
Oh, you're beautiful.

487
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,434
- Do you read me, Pelham?
- I'd go in with guns and blast 'em out!

488
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,348
Why don't you start doin' your work
and let the police do theirs, huh?

489
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,392
Like that cop on the train.
When's he gonna start shootin'?

490
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,272
We don't know if it is a "he".

491
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,153
- Do you read me, Pelham?
- Women cops! What good are they?

492
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,919
Probably can't find her gun
in her goddamn purse!

493
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,395
Pelham One Two Three.
Any news to report?

494
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,080
What's that about news?
Say again about news.

495
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,998
I said have you any news to report?

496
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,909
- No, nothin' yet.
- Atchoo!

497
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,232
Gesundheit!

498
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,511
- What are you calling about?
- Pelham, we need more time.

499
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,596
Shut the door, please.

500
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,757
It is 2.24, Lieutenant.
You've got 49 minutes left.

501
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,314
Be reasonable.
We're tryin' to cooperate,

502
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,591
but we can't do anything
if you don't give us enough time.

503
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,869
49 minutes.

504
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,390
We're dealin' with City Hall. You know
what a mess of red tape that is?

505
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,714
49 minutes.

506
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,754
Look, fella, we know how to tell the time,

507
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,429
but we aren't gonna get any place
if all you do is repeat 49 minutes!

508
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,437
48 minutes.

509
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,951
Yeah, all right, all right.
We'll get back to you as soon as we can.

510
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,959
To hear you plead with that chickenshit
makes me ashamed to be an American!

511
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,798
Go play with your trains.

512
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,911
(siren)

513
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,631
(radio) Stay tuned for an update
on the subway hijacking case.

514
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,193
(music)

515
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,436
Get me the borough commander.

516
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,028
- Turn off that goddamn music.
- Yes, sir.

517
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,550
Harry? l'm headin' up to see the mayor.
What's it look like down there?

518
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,070
It's murder, Phil, as usual.
They really smell blood on this one.

519
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,556
- Who's your number two?
- Deputy Chief lnspector Daniels.

520
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,717
He's a good man, Phil.
He handled that protest last month.

521
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,037
- Get those photographers outta here!
- How are you deployed?

522
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,958
50 men inside the tunnel,
north and south of the train,

523
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,629
well concealed, all wearin' vests
and armed with machine guns,

524
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,514
shotguns, handguns, riot guns,
and a half-dozen snipers.

525
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,756
We could fight
the Third World War down there!

526
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,271
Make sure they stay outta sight. If the
hijackers see 'em, we'll have a massacre.

527
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,870
We have a sniper's report that
they're movin' around pretty freely.

528
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,639
The one in the motorman's cab
is an easy shot.

529
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,550
Absolutely no! understand? We're takin'
the threat seriously! What's upstairs?

530
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,434
Trucks, cars, emergency and
medical units. The works, Phil.

531
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,835
Harry... tell me somethin', will ya?

532
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,230
They're in a tunnel, surrounded on all
sides. How do they expect to get away?

533
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,149
Beats the shit out of me, Phil.

534
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,913
(mayor blowing his nose)

535
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,318
(mayor's wife) Oh, Al, it's disgustin'.
Would you stop it with the tissue?

536
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,831
Warren, tell him that other mayors have
to live in this house after we're gone.

537
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,191
Go on in there, Al, and l'll send
everybody in. Just sit down.

538
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,551
Thanks for comin' up
on such short notice, fellas.

539
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,636
You all know Jessie, don't you?

540
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,790
Good, Phil, just in time.

541
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,312
A little coffee? Some cake?

542
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,908
Better skip it, Jessie. We're short on time.

543
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,156
We know what's goin' on underground.

544
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,999
The issue is whether or not
we pay the ransom.

545
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,156
Phil? Whaddaya think?

546
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,354
Well, we're fully mobilised. There's
enough firepower to wipe out an army.

547
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,358
But... I can't guarantee
the safety of the hostages.

548
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,029
In other words, you're for
payin' the ransom.

549
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,355
Well, we don't want
another Attica, do we?

550
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,596
- So your vote is?
- I abstain.

551
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,796
Shit! Barney?

552
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,628
The safety of the passengers is
the only concern of the Transit Authority.

553
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,955
- Your vote?
- Pay the two dollars.

554
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,117
If it was two dollars,
l'd pay the two dollars, Barney!

555
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,915
It's a million! A one with six zeros!
ls it comin' outta your pocket?

556
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,749
Come on, will ya save the poor mouth
for later? How do you vote?

557
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,555
- I'm not through discussin' it yet.
- Yes, you are. Now vote.

558
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,194
My concern is with the taxpayers.

559
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,437
I always say millions for defence
but not one cent for tribute.

560
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,155
- Isn't that what l always say?
- uh-huh. So that's a "no".

561
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,239
All right, Al. You've heard from
the Three Wise Men.

562
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,437
- Now what do you say?
- What are they goin' to say, Warren?

563
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,876
- Who?
- Everybody!

564
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,675
- The press! The man on the street!
- He means the voters.

565
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,636
The Times will support you,
the News will knock you.

566
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,673
The Post will take both sides. The rich'll
support you. Likewise the blacks.

567
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,156
The Puerto Ricans won't give a shit.
So quit stallin'.

568
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,990
Stop bullyin' everybody, Warren!
This is supposed to be a democracy!

569
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,511
Wise up, for Christ sake! We're tryin' to
run a city, not a goddamn democracy!

570
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,040
Al, quit fartin' around! We've gotta pay!

571
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,312
Jessie?

572
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,396
Jessie, what do you say?

573
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,148
A million dollars sounds like
a lot of money.

574
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,511
But just think what
you're gonna get in return.

575
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,393
- What?
- 18 sure votes.

576
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,590
All right. All right. Warren?

577
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,759
- Warren, arrange for the payoff.
- Hallelujah.

578
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,032
Fellas, you heard him. Phil, pass the word
to the bad guys that we're coughin' up.

579
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,755
- What bank do we do business with?
- City National Trust. I'll call.

580
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,317
I'll call. You'll take an hour tryin'
to knock down the interest rate.

581
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,356
Jessie?

582
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,076
I think l handled it all right.

583
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,395
A regular Fiorello La Guardia.

584
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,388
- Patrolman James callin' Operations.
- This is Patrone. What's goin' on?

585
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,557
There's a lot of feet movin' around
out here in the dark.

586
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,513
I figure it's a couple of dozen
sharpshooters and snipers.

587
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,551
- Am l right?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

588
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,038
Make sure they know l'm standin' here
between them and the hijackers.

589
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,310
I'm not all that easy to see in the dark.

590
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,956
Nothin' yet?

591
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,870
Boy! They're sure takin'
their time, aren't they?

592
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,755
- Don't worry. They're gonna have to pay.
- Suppose they don't?

593
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,553
Well, then a lot of people are gonna die.

594
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,076
Includin' us.

595
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,959
Better than selling life insurance, isn't it?

596
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,833
Life insurance? You told me
you were in the army.

597
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,714
I was. That's where l developed
my expensive tastes.

598
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,673
British army. $1 50 a month.
You gotta be kiddin'.

599
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,155
The Africans paid me 5,000.

600
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,030
- A month?
- For leading a battalion.

601
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,118
Jesus! What the hell'd
you get outta that for?

602
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,836
Because the market dried up.

603
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,916
Wow!

604
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,156
5,000!

605
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,758
At least you weren't fired.
But l don't give a shit.

606
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,316
What guy wants to drive a subway train
for the rest of his life?

607
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,795
What did they catch you doing?

608
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,836
Nothin'.

609
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,277
I mean, they framed me.
They needed a fall guy.

610
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,154
Transit cops. undercover guys.
They got wind of a gang passin' dope.

611
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,751
Transportin' from downtown to uptown,
and givin' it to a motorman.

612
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,430
They tried to pin the evidence on me,
but they didn't find a thing.

613
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,551
You were innocent?

614
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,117
Of course l was innocent.
You think l'd do a thing like that?

615
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,436
(siren)

616
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,759
I'm on my way to headquarters.
We got the green light.

617
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,633
That's great news.
The men are rarin' to go.

618
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,072
No! We're paying 'em the ransom money.
Pass the word along to the hijackers.

619
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,270
Roger.

620
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,075
Borough Command to the 28th Street
platform. Come in, Daniels.

621
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,189
Daniels.

622
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,552
The mayor's agreed to pay.
Let the hijackers know right away.

623
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,636
Roger.

624
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,035
Command Centre, this is 28th Street.

625
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,115
Do you read me, Command Centre?

626
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,550
- This is Command Centre. Who is this?
- Chieflnspector Daniels.

627
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,235
The mayor's agreed to pay.
Pass it on to the hijackers right away.

628
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,316
Will do, sir.

629
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,029
Pelham One Two Three.

630
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,396
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

631
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,076
This is Pelham One Two Three.
I read you.

632
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,270
We agree to pay the ransom.
Repeat, we agree to pay...

633
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,709
What? They're gonna do what?

634
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,478
Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three?

635
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,309
- Zach, you're outta your skull.
- I read you, Garber.

636
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,910
Take down my next instructions,
to be followed to the letter.

637
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,998
The money's to be paid
in the following denominations..

638
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,031
500,000 dollars in fifties.

639
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,674
500,000 dollars in hundreds. Right?

640
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,278
500,000 in fifties. 500,000 in hundreds.

641
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,948
Which will be put
in stacks of 200 bills each,

642
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,071
bound with two thick elastic bands.

643
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,075
Two stacks of bills, bound in what?

644
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,634
Bound with thick elastic bands.

645
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,753
All of the bills will be old bills,
their serial numbers to be random.

646
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,034
Now that's all. When the delivery arrives
we'll contact you with further instructions.

647
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,118
- About what? Your getaway?
- Signing offnow.

648
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,196
Son of a bitch!

649
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:15,069
Hey, Pelham. It might interest you to
know l figured out how you're gonna do it.

650
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,233
Yes, it would interest me very much.

651
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,828
You're gonna make everyone
in New York City

652
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,633
close their eyes and count
to a hundred, right?

653
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,639
It is now 2.47. That means
you have got 26 minutes...

654
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,673
Hey, wait a minute, pal. We agreed
to pay the money. Turn your clock off!

655
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,917
- 26 minutes.
- Your instructions were complicated.

656
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,759
The money has to be counted,
stacked, transported.

657
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,075
It just isn't physically possible.

658
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,388
You'd be surprised
what's physically possible.

659
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,476
The clock's running.

660
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,671
26 minutes. After that,
we scratch 'em off one per minute.

661
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,117
(Mr Blue) Your attention, please!

662
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,676
Ladies and gentlemen,
it might interest you to know

663
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,712
the city of New York has agreed
to pay for your release.

664
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,796
(cries ofdelight)

665
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,517
As soon as the money gets here,
will you let us go?

666
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,119
Soon after.

667
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,189
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
telling us how much you're getting?

668
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:31,189
- Why is that of interest to you, sir?
- Well, a person likes to know his worth.

669
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,869
- One million dollars.
- That's not so terrific.

670
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,999
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK
LOWER MANHATTAN

671
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,710
Pull your pants up, Al.
We're goin' downtown.

672
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,753
- Totally out of the question, Mr LaSalle.
- Nobody asked you.

673
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,715
Warren, for Pete's sake,
l'm sick as a goat. What's the point?

674
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,549
The point, for Pete's sake, is that
the mayor of the city of New York,

675
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,353
trailin' by 22 points in all the polls,

676
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,994
cares enough about
18 citizens in jeopardy

677
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,588
to make a personal appearance
in their behalf.

678
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,191
You know what'll happen?
What always happens. I'll get booed.

679
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,678
- He's a very sick man.
- Will you let go of that!

680
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,753
All you have to do is say a few words
to the hijackers over a bullhorn.

681
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,155
You make a dignified plea for mercy.

682
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,795
Warren, suppose the hijackers
start shootin' at me?

683
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,639
Will you stop!
They have no reason to shoot at you.

684
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,037
Why? Do you think
they're from outta town?

685
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,149
(AI chuckles)

686
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,794
Get dressed, Al. I'll do the jokes.

687
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,028
Garber. Come in, Garber.
Come in, Garber.

688
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,920
- Who are we waitin' for, Z?
- Beats me.

689
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,680
How long's it take to get
all that money together?

690
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,439
We'll never make it.
The passengers are dead ducks.

691
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,869
- I wonder what that cop's thinkin'.
- What cop?

692
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,798
The one who's a hostage.
Shit, l'm glad it's not me.

693
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,388
- Where's that money?
- Make yourselfuseful.

694
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:13,311
Get Personnel to get a list of all motormen
discharged durin' the past ten years.

695
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,718
- What are you lookin' for?
- Somebody down there can drive a train.

696
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,478
Tell 'em you want it today.

697
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,198
Mr Grey, can l have a word
with you, please?

698
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,232
Will you stop messing around
with that girl, Mr Grey?

699
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,430
She's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker.

700
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,438
- Who's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker?
- Leave her alone.

701
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,949
Who are you to go around
callin' people "hooker"?!

702
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,719
I can do this job and hump
that broad at the same time.

703
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,992
Listen, you little prick! 20 bucks
wouldn't buy you a good-night kiss!

704
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,873
I'm giving you an order, Mr Grey.

705
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,991
Blow it outta your ass,

706
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,473
Colonel.

707
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,113
You're talkin' to the wrong man.
I'm not your Mr B-B-B-Brown.

708
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,118
I once had a man shot
for talking to me like that.

709
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,478
Well, that's the difference between us.
I've always done my own killin'.

710
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,958
Takin' a hell of a long time.

711
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,551
Think how many times you gotta wet
your thumb to count a million bucks.

712
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,799
Command Centre callin' 28th Street.
Come in, lnspector.

713
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,069
This is Daniels.

714
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,034
- Has the money left yet, lnspector?
- Not yet.

715
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,311
What are they waitin' for?
Give 'em a goose, will ya?

716
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,829
We're runnin' outta time!
We're runnin' outta time!

717
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,152
(Mr Grey whistling)

718
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,558
Pelham One Two Three, this is Command
Centre. Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

719
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,833
- This is Pelham One Two Three.
- This is Garber.

720
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,999
We're movin' a little slowly at this end,
Pelham. We need some more time.

721
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,278
Sorry, no more time.

722
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,472
If you can just see your way...

723
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:33,276
- Will you hold it down, Frank?
- I want a local sent around the loop...

724
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,392
I said knock it off!
l'm tryin' to buy some time here!

725
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,590
And l'm tryin' to run a railroad!

726
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,951
While you're playin' grab-ass
with a bunch of pirates!

727
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,117
How about 1 5 more minutes, Pelham?
A lousy 1 5 minutes?

728
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,669
Negative.

729
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,869
Ten minutes, then. What difference
can ten minutes make to you?

730
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,752
Negative.

731
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,758
- Anythin' wrong?
- Wanted more time.

732
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,839
- How much more?
- Just ten minutes.

733
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,793
- That can't hurt anybody.
- I didn't give it to them.

734
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,959
- Suppose they can't make it?
- Then we do what we said we'd do.

735
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,433
- Maybe an hour isn't enough time.
- You give 'em an hour, they take an hour.

736
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:22,156
Give 'em two hours, they take two hours.
An hour is plenty of time, Mr Green.

737
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,635
Yeah, but supposin' it isn't?

738
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,557
This is the borough commander.
Come in, Headquarters Charlie!

739
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,755
Aren't you guys movin' yet?
Do you know what the damn time is?

740
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,269
We're still waitin' for the money, sir.

741
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,393
If l don't see your faces before the
deadline, l don't wanna see them at all!

742
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,829
- Ever!
- Yes, sir.

743
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,315
I told you. It's gonna be our ass.

744
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,155
- This is a million dollars?
- It's what it buys. Not what it weighs.

745
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,115
(siren)

746
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,076
(siren)

747
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,431
(siren)

748
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,440
Eight minutes. We're not gonna make it.

749
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,795
- Inspector, where are they now, please?
- Centre Street, just north of Chambers.

750
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,798
That gives us seven minutes.
Not enough time, sir.

751
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,152
Even if they get to 28th Street on time,
we still gotta carry it down track on foot.

752
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,236
No way, sir.

753
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,156
(brakes screeching)

754
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,792
Look, we're scarin' the shit
outta everybody.

755
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,876
Yeah, includin' me.

756
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,709
Pelham One Two Three, this is Garber.
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

757
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,195
Garber, this is Pelham One Two Three.

758
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,314
The money's en route, makin' pretty good
time too, but it won't get to you by 3.1 3.

759
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,476
I'm very sorry to hear that.

760
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,716
Suppose we get it to the entrance by then.

761
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,719
Will you change your deadline from
delivery to you to arrival at 28th Street?

762
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:48,358
Would you do that at least? Do you
read me, Pelham, for cryin' out loud?

763
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,711
All right, Garber.
But no more concessions.

764
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,509
- Is that quite clear?
- Quite clear. Quite clear.

765
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,552
They bought it. If we get the money
to the station by 3.1 3 we'll be OK.

766
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,795
Good work, Garber.

767
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,755
Headquarters Charlie,
headin' north on Centre Street...

768
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,757
You've got four minutes!

769
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,440
Yes, sir, we'll make it...
We'll never make it.

770
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,516
Sir, the mayor is on his way down.

771
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,676
We'll hold the crowd till he gets here.

772
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,756
(siren)

773
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,549
(shouting)

774
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,596
Mr Green.

775
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,915
Yes.

776
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,235
Coming up in one minute.

777
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,914
Have you decided which one
it's gonna be?

778
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,190
Does that make any difference?

779
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,316
I guess not.

780
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,517
OK. 50 seconds and then
l'm gonna eliminate one.

781
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,878
Headquarters Charlie,
approachin' Astor Place.

782
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,879
You've still got 28 blocks!
Floor the son of a bitch!

783
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,516
(brakes screech)

784
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,872
Whaddaya mean, it's been wrecked?
We're outta time!

785
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,549
I know we're outta time.
Couldn't make it, that's all.

786
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,752
That's all? They're about
to shoot an innocent person!

787
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,634
If they know the truck is wrecked,
how can they expect us to be on time?

788
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,275
They don't know anythin' down there.
How can they know anythin'...

789
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,356
Holy mackerel, that's it.

790
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,191
Pelham One Two Three, the money has
arrived. Repeat, the money has arrived.

791
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,719
Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three?
The money has arrived.

792
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,192
This is Pelham One Two Three.
You made it just in time, didn't you?

793
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,755
Get it up there! Move!

794
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,877
I hope it works.

795
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,396
(siren)

796
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,276
Are you still there, Garber?

797
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,752
Still here. Tell me somethin', Pelham.

798
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,316
If we were a second late, you would've
knocked off an innocent party?

799
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,149
Affirmative. Now the instructions
for the delivery ofthe money.

800
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,192
As usual, you'll follow them
to the letter, OK?

801
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,276
I got it. Go ahead.

802
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,632
Two unarmed policemen...

803
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,670
Atchoo!

804
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,151
Gesundheit.

805
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,113
Two unarmed policemen
will walk down the track.

806
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,356
One with the money,
the other with a torch,

807
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,392
which he will flash continuously
from side to side.

808
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,872
When they reach the car,
the rear door will be opened

809
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,833
and the one with the money
will throw it onto the train.

810
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,511
Then they will both turn and walk back
to 28th Street station. Acknowledge.

811
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,949
- I got it. Is that all?
- That's all for now.

812
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,390
But keep in mind, won't you,
that the same ground rules apply.

813
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,149
Any wrong move by anyone
and l kill a hostage.

814
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,952
Coulda guessed that part.

815
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,913
You have got five minutes
to deliver this money.

816
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,555
You don't think
you're gonna get out, do ya?

817
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,756
It's now 3.14.

818
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,878
You've got till 3.19.

819
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,353
Over.

820
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,071
Over. Bastard.

821
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,156
(siren)

822
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,037
About fuckin' time!

823
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,515
You two! Get the money outta there!

824
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,791
Which one has the flashlight?
Then you carry the money.

825
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,195
Gimme that paper.
You've got four minutes!

826
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,232
Never mind the goddamn salutes!
Just get goin'!

827
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,396
(crowd boos)

828
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,355
Jesus, it's the goddamn mayor.

829
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,751
- You get the feelin' we ain't alone?
- Whaddaya mean?

830
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:40,630
We got four sub-machine-guns in front
of us, and all these jokers behind us.

831
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,991
I feel like l'm walkin' into
the fuckin' OK Corral.

832
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,516
Pow!

833
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,756
Shit!

834
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,475
(gunshot/screaming)

835
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,276
(man) Hold your fire, goddamnit!

836
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,277
- (whimpering)
- Quiet!

837
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,829
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. It's not too b-b-bad.

838
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,270
- I think it went right through.
- Move back, come on. Move back.

839
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,233
Give me that scarf. Give me that scarf!

840
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,112
Keep quiet!

841
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,915
- OK?
- Yeah. I don't feel p-pain too much.

842
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,795
- How many shots?
- Just one.

843
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,072
The rest was me and then they answered.
I didn't see anybody, l just got mad.

844
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,519
Goddamnit!

845
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,039
Mr Grey?

846
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,592
You don't think they're finished
out there, do ya?

847
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,269
Go back there and help Mr Green,
will you, please?

848
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,758
Some girl-scout
chickenshit outfit l'm in here.

849
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,395
I suppose somebody out there
got nervous or bored.

850
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,476
Been there a long time.

851
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,237
Can't afford to let it pass.

852
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,593
(Rico) Who started it?
Who fired first? Them or us?

853
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,918
I don't know, Lieutenant. It came from
somewhere behind me in the dark.

854
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,156
It had to be one of the snipers.

855
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,114
Somebody just took it in his head
to fire on his own? How could he?

856
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,390
Easy, Lieutenant.

857
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,158
Real easy.

858
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,352
Can you see what's goin' on
inside the train?

859
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,957
No, not too good.
I'd sure hate to be in there findin' out.

860
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,236
Conductor.

861
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,396
- You mean me?
- Yes. Stand up and come down here.

862
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,513
- Why, what are you gonna do?
- You can help me.

863
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:33,077
- Come on. Come down here.
- Look, if he doesn't wanna go...

864
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,557
All right, everybody. Just get back
on your seats. Very quietly.

865
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,556
Come on. Back on your seats.

866
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,434
All right, conductor. I want you to
walk up track about a hundred feet.

867
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,109
Just wait for the men delivering
the money, all right?

868
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,196
I'll open the door for you.

869
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,395
Why do l have to go?

870
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,592
Come on. Please go.
There's nothing to worry about.

871
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,034
Look! Somebody's climbin' down!

872
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,590
Christ, he's comin' this way!

873
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,479
(woman) Oh, no!

874
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,636
(children crying)

875
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,949
What?

876
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,834
Why would they shoot a hostage?
We're still under the deadline.

877
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,838
- Somebody threw a shot at them.
- Who the hell was it?

878
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,269
Nobody knows. My bet is we never will.

879
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,312
Z, when are we gonna hear
from that cop who's on board?

880
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,228
What do you want, Rico? A suicide?
There's heavily armed men down there.

881
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,353
What chance has one lousy cop got,
especially if it's a dame?

882
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,076
Boy, what a mess!

883
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,357
Pelham One Two Three, come in.
This is Garber.

884
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,835
Here is Pelham One Two Three.
Come in, Garber.

885
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,713
For Christ's sake, fella,
did ya have to do it?

886
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,957
One of my men was fired at.
I warned you what the penalty would be.

887
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,799
- Yeah, you warned me.
- Where's the money?

888
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,913
I'm going to give you 30 seconds more.

889
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,636
(children crying)

890
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,439
Hey, you guys!

891
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,838
- Christ, who's that?
- Transit cop. I got orders for you.

892
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,474
Resume delivery on the double.

893
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,717
I don't suppose we could
have that in writin'?

894
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,835
Mr Blue, we got a light!

895
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,398
All right. Open the door,
would you, Mr Brown?

896
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,629
All right, gentlemen.
Hands in evidence, please.

897
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,796
Put up your hands!

898
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,873
All right. Throw the money up here.

899
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,796
Into the cab.

900
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,876
Push it up.

901
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,398
Thank you. Now turn around.

902
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,398
Go home to your wives and children.
Keep the hands up. Take it very easily.

903
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,274
Shut the door, Mr Brown, will you?

904
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,116
Mr Grey.

905
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,916
(woman) Jesus H Christ!

906
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,475
I've never seen a million dollars before.

907
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,160
You can load up first, Mr Grey.

908
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,191
I'll talk to Garber.

909
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,754
All that money! l can't believe it!

910
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,271
I'm gonna die today.

911
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,153
Well... either you live or you die.

912
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,798
- That's 18 packs each, right?
- Right.

913
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,992
This is Pelham One Two Three.
Do you read me, Garber?

914
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,999
- This is Garber. Go ahead.
- I'm gonna give you three instructions.

915
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,759
Each one is to be followed precisely.
Is that clear?

916
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,279
So far.

917
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:54,118
1 ) At the end of this conversation, you
will restore power to the entire sector.

918
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,553
Right. Restore power.

919
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,593
2) You will clear the local track all the
way from 28th Street to South Ferry.

920
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:05,235
By clear l mean switches properly set,
all signals green.

921
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,078
I emphasise green, Garber.

922
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,397
If l so much as see a red light,
let alone get tripped by one,

923
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,511
I'll shoot another hostage.

924
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,114
You will also remove all police
from the tunnel.

925
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,800
Ifl see a policeman
between here and South Ferry,

926
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,193
I'll shoot another hostage.
Any deviation, l'll shoot another hostage.

927
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:36,110
Listen, fella, after this is over
you should seek out psychiatric help.

928
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:41,231
Let me know when all my points have
been complied with. Over and out.

929
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,873
- Rico, are you there?
- I'm here, Z. What's up?

930
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,355
Hold on while l cut in the City cops.

931
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,514
Frank, hook me up and get outta there.

932
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,836
What a way to run a railroad!

933
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,354
- Inspector Daniels. This is Garber.
- This is Daniels.

934
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,468
Inspector, l have Lieutenant Patrone
of the Transit Police on the line.

935
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,071
The hijackers want power restored,
all tracks cleared,

936
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,949
signals green to South Ferry,
and no cops anywhere in sight.

937
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,914
OK, sir, so we go along with that.
We have to. But then what?

938
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,429
- What do you think they got in mind?
- Beats me, Z.

939
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,949
I wouldn't have picked a tunnel
for a getaway.

940
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,718
But they did pick it.

941
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:27,231
And since everythin' they've done has
been worked out to the smallest detail,

942
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,874
it stands to reason
they got the rest worked out.

943
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,037
Power restored and track cleared.
But why South Ferry?

944
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:38,280
Well, do you think it's the water, Rico?
Maybe they got a boat in the harbour.

945
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:43,196
We'd better play it one step at a time.
Garber, you see about restorin' the power.

946
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,153
I'll start pullin' our units out of the tunnel.

947
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:50,478
We can follow them on the street.
Except how do we know where they'll be?

948
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,239
Grand Central Tower
has 'em on their board.

949
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,989
They stop any place before South Ferry,
we know about it.

950
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,878
I'll check in when l get to my car.

951
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,199
(Rico) ljust figured out how
they're gonna get away.

952
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,471
- I'm listenin'.
- They're gonna fly the train to Cuba.

953
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,358
You're a sick man, Rico.

954
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,519
Whaddaya want me to do?
The power's still off! Move 'em by bus!

955
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:16,473
You haven't got any buses?
Go out and hijack some!

956
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,673
Hey, Garber, what's goin' on?
Do l get my trains back now or don't l?

957
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,438
You don't. Not yet.

958
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,393
Do you realise the goddamn
rush hour starts in an hour?

959
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,796
Will you shut up and listen?
l got a new set of instructions.

960
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:34,790
Your fuckin' instructions! l'm not liftin' a
finger to help the killers of Caz Dolowicz.

961
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,074
Hey!

962
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,078
Now you listen to me,
you dumb son of a bitch.

963
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:47,318
If you don't do what l say, you'll be havin'
dinner tonight with Caz Dolowicz!

964
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,396
Jesus Christ, what are you...!

965
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,078
(cries ofrelief)

966
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,953
OK.

967
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,676
Better take the case out.

968
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,316
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Pay attention, please.

969
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,431
In a while we hope to be moving again.

970
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,597
Then, with a bit of luck,
you'll be released unharmed.

971
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:19,508
until then, of course,
you'll continue to obey my orders.

972
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,596
Thank you for your cooperation.

973
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,676
Hey, dude.

974
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,793
As you're goin' downtown anyway, you
mind droppin' me off at Fulton Street?

975
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,078
You're a wise mother, you know that?
Like some more?

976
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,157
This'll give 'em a jolt,
even before they expected it.

977
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,914
- Look at this.
- Holy Christ, she's movin'.

978
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,350
They promised to wait until
we cleared track all the way down.

979
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,436
Jenkins, get Command Centre.

980
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,195
Grand Central Tower,
callin' Command Centre.

981
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,959
- Command Centre.
- She's movin'.

982
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,355
- Who's movin'?
- Pelham One Two Three.

983
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,436
What? Since when?

984
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,879
Just started.

985
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,275
Hold on. I'll put ya on a tie-in.

986
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,236
Rico, she's movin'.

987
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,148
- Who's movin'?
- Who do ya think? Pelham.

988
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:10,274
- It's too soon. We're not set up yet.
- You heard from Daniels yet?

989
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,550
He's in a squad car
on Park Avenue South.

990
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,718
- Inspector? She's movin', sir.
- Who's movin'?

991
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,197
What's the matter with everybody?
How many hijacked trains we got?

992
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,195
They're not supposed to do that yet.
How far have they gone?

993
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:29,518
- Grand Central? How far have they gone?
- Comin' up on 23rd Street.

994
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,277
- Better move those cops off the platform.
- Better follow along down Park Avenue.

995
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,674
Get me 23rd Street.

996
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,631
Comin' in to 23rd Street.

997
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,433
All right. Steady as she goes now.

998
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,156
(siren)

999
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:05,316
Garber? Just had a terrible thought. What
if they set the throttle and jumped off?

1000
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,194
While we're chasin' the train, they're
sneakin' out somewhere behind us.

1001
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,914
Ingenious, sir, except it's impossible.

1002
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,033
- Why?
- A gizmo known as a deadman's feature.

1003
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:19,869
It's built into the control handle
in case the motorman drops dead.

1004
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,391
The handle has to have a man's hand
pressin' down on it, hard, at all times.

1005
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,114
Otherwise it don't work.
The train stops cold.

1006
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,559
I see.

1007
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,310
Nice try, though. I'll give 'em a call
in case you're still worried about it.

1008
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,196
Pelham One Two Three,
what's goin' on down there?

1009
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:40,073
The tracks aren't cleared yet.
How come you're movin'?

1010
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,555
We're trying to put some
distance between us

1011
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,070
and all those policemen
you've got hidden back there.

1012
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,509
You're gonna run into a lot of red signals.

1013
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,030
- I don't want you to blame us for it.
- I won't blame you for anything.

1014
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,835
Just let us know when you've
cleared the track. OK, signing off.

1015
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,393
Do you think he's able to figure anythin'
out? l mean, all those questions.

1016
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,478
Not surprising under
the circumstances, is it?

1017
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,635
They're thinking what
we want them to think.

1018
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,876
Ah, there it is.

1019
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,310
OK. Stop a few yards past it, will you?

1020
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,396
All right.

1021
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,598
Thank you, Mr Green.

1022
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,400
He shut down again. Pass it along.

1023
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,036
Grand Central Tower callin' Command
Centre. Come in, Command Centre.

1024
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,149
Command Centre.

1025
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,636
She stopped again, Lieutenant.
Below 18th Street station.

1026
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,716
Got ya. Thanks.

1027
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,675
Inspector, they stopped again.
Where are you?

1028
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,031
- Approachin' 17th Street.
- Pull over. You're right above them.

1029
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,912
And then what?

1030
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,508
It's up to them. I'll get back to you, sir.

1031
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,838
Pelham One Two Three. Callin' Pelham
One Two Three. Come in, please.

1032
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,116
Pelham One Two Three, Pelham One Two
Three, this is Command Centre. Come in.

1033
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,196
Quick as you can.

1034
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,957
Pelham One Two Three.
This is Garber. Come in, please.

1035
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,036
Come in, please.

1036
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,434
What the hell's goin' on out there?

1037
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,278
Who s-s-said you could talk?

1038
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,594
(children laugh)

1039
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,869
(children cry)

1040
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:31,069
Pelham One Two Three, come in. Pelham
One Two Three, why don't you answer?

1041
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,869
Frank, how long before
the track's cleared?

1042
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,709
You mean before this railroad is so fucked
it'll take a computer to put it back?

1043
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,513
Yes, Frank, that's what l meant.

1044
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,189
About five or six minutes.
I got a snag at Brooklyn Bridge.

1045
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,795
- There's somethin' goin' on down there.
- Whaddaya think?

1046
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,070
I don't have the slightest idea.

1047
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,395
Rico, l don't care what those clowns said,
l want men on every...

1048
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,636
Wait a minute. Hold on a second.

1049
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,749
Inspector Daniels?

1050
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,839
I think we need officers on every platform
from 14th Street to South Ferry.

1051
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,916
Good idea, Lieutenant. Will do.

1052
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,600
I'll come up to 17th Street and join ya.

1053
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,349
Rico, how about that list of motormen?

1054
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,914
They're workin' on it. I told 'em to rush it.

1055
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:19,238
Come up here and take over the radio for
me. But don't tell 'em the track's clear.

1056
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,954
I don't want them startin' again
until l get there.

1057
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,399
Will do, Z.

1058
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,156
(truck horn)

1059
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,116
(siren)

1060
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,192
- Inspector Daniels?
- Daniels.

1061
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,869
Oh, l, uh... I thought you were a, uh...
Iike a shorter guy.

1062
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,195
I don't know what l thought.

1063
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,513
- Anythin' happenin'?
- They're still down there.

1064
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,473
If this street collapsed,
we'd land right on top of 'em.

1065
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,989
Command Centre to DCl, Manhattan.

1066
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,918
Yeah, Rico, this is Garber.

1067
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,510
Track's been cleared for two minutes.
Should l call the hijackers?

1068
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,997
Yeah, let 'em know. And let us know
when they start movin', will ya?

1069
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:44,193
What do we do? lf they pick up speed
on us we'll have trouble keepin' up.

1070
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,357
I think we oughta take off.
Get a jump on them for a change.

1071
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:52,190
Move it. Tell the sergeant to hold
the men here until further word.

1072
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,276
Yes, sir.

1073
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,394
Fits like a glove.

1074
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,149
- Is it gonna come away clean?
- It's gonna work all right.

1075
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,669
Command Centre to
Pelham One Two Three.

1076
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,360
- Who's that?
- Give me the mike.

1077
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,272
- Here.
- This is Pelham.

1078
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,790
- What happened to Garber?
- Even great men have to pee.

1079
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,158
The track's cleared
all the way to South Ferry.

1080
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,999
Thank you.
Give the lieutenant my regards.

1081
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,591
- Do it yourself, at the arraignment.
- Over and out.

1082
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,358
Best get going.

1083
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,436
All right, Mr Brown.

1084
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,913
You will all remain seated.
That means nobody is to get up.

1085
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,679
OK.

1086
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,999
- Now what?
- Me you're askin'?

1087
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,876
OK. Come on.

1088
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,836
Hey, where are you goin'?!

1089
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,155
I'm a police officer!

1090
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,793
- Mr Blue?
- Yeah, what do you want?

1091
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,708
- I thought l saw somethin' f-f-fall off.
- What do you mean, something?

1092
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,311
- Might've been a person. I ain't sure.
- All right, let's make sure.

1093
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,112
We haven't got time.
Get back up here. Come on.

1094
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:59,750
Command Centre,
Pelham One Two Three's in motion!

1095
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,435
Where do you think
they're takin' us now?!

1096
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,394
- Don't worry, they're gonna let us all go!
- How do you know that?!

1097
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,909
They got the money!
They got what they want!

1098
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,476
(Spanish)

1099
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,356
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Can't anybody count?

1100
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,434
They all four got off!

1101
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,669
There's nobody drivin' the fuckin' train!

1102
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,153
(screaming)

1103
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,435
Anybody in there?!

1104
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,638
All right, all clear.

1105
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,593
All right, then. You know the drill.

1106
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,792
We do it by the numbers. Hats.

1107
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,349
- Glasses.
- Drills and numbers...

1108
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,313
This is all chickenshit.
Why don't we just do it?

1109
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,396
Moustaches.

1110
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,160
(Mr Blue) All right, reverse coats.

1111
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:45,157
Pelham One Two Three's between Astor
Place and Bleecker. Speed's increasin'.

1112
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:49,189
Pelham One Two Three now between
Astor Place and Bleecker.

1113
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,720
Doesn't make any sense. They know
we're monitorin' their position.

1114
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,432
- So?
- So it's dumb.

1115
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,198
Who said crooks were smart?

1116
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,472
But these have been smart.
We're overlookin' somethin', lnspector.

1117
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,956
OK. New hats.

1118
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,194
(Mr Blue) OK. Magazines in pockets.

1119
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,269
- I never knew these things went so fast!
- We're gonna be killed!

1120
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:30,076
- Stop it! Nobody's gonna get killed!
- A hell of a lot you know, old man!

1121
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,193
But l do know! l've been ridin' the
subways since before you were born!

1122
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:39,519
I'm an expert. You see, they have
something called stoppers,

1123
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,870
or stickers, or something like that.

1124
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,516
And whenever a train goes by a red light,
these things stop them.

1125
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,439
- There's just one thing, baby!
- What's that?

1126
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,915
They're all green!

1127
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:03,836
Inspector, that short move they made
between 28th Street and 17th Street.

1128
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,997
- Why'd they do that?
- I don't know.

1129
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,270
Suppose they wanted to do somethin'

1130
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,994
they didn't want anybody else
to know about?

1131
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,476
- Like what?
- Like jumpin' off the train.

1132
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,955
Turn around.
We're goin' back to 17th Street.

1133
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,038
- Like hell we are!
- They are not on the train. I'm sure of it.

1134
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:24,118
I suggested that in the first place.
You shot me down.

1135
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,630
- A deadman's feature?
- They figured out how to beat that!

1136
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,150
That's their plan!
That's what they started with!

1137
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,314
Turn this thing around and burn rubber.

1138
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,396
(brakes screech)

1139
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,556
Guns to Mr Brown.

1140
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,912
Mr Grey, would you be good enough
to give that gun to Mr Brown, please?

1141
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:56,352
No. This ain't gonna go nowhere.
This is gonna stay with me.

1142
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,988
Mr Grey, bring that gun back here, please.

1143
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:06,035
What if they're waitin' for us up there?
l want some heavy artillery with me.

1144
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:10,597
- Mr Grey, l won't ask you again.
- Blow it outta your ass, Mr Blue.

1145
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,712
Oh, my God.

1146
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,356
Let's get his money!

1147
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,156
Mr Green, come on!

1148
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,269
(gunshot)

1149
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,433
(gunshot)

1150
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,993
(gunshot)

1151
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,393
Mr Blue!

1152
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,996
Did you get him?

1153
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,316
You go on ahead. We'll meet
where we planned. Right?

1154
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,715
- You better be right about this, Garber.
- Even if l am, it's probably too late.

1155
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,796
(siren)

1156
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,793
(gunshot)

1157
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,478
Where are those goddamn red lights?!

1158
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,556
(children crying)

1159
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,233
We're not stopping!

1160
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,999
There is going to be a red light!
There has to be!

1161
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,590
- What if there isn't?!
- There has to be!

1162
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,556
(siren)

1163
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,718
Check the emergency exits!

1164
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,549
Inspector, you take 1 5th Street.
Officer, you take 17th Street.

1165
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,033
Right, sir.

1166
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,918
Are you a policeman?

1167
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:31,873
Well done. The mayor
will go to your funeral.

1168
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36,151
(Garber) Excuse me, fella,
would you mind droppin' that gun?

1169
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,154
Drop it!

1170
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,556
(drops gun)

1171
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:58,235
Officer, l suppose you couldn't use
a quarter of a million dollars, could you?

1172
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,669
Quarter of a million? No, thanks.

1173
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,396
My accountant says l've accepted
enough for this fiscal quarter.

1174
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,709
You're the English guy on the radio.

1175
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,398
Yes.

1176
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,630
- Lieutenant Garber?
- Right. Do you wanna move along?

1177
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,191
Excuse me... Do you people
still execute in this state?

1178
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,350
What? Oh, execute.
No. Not at the moment.

1179
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,318
Pity.

1180
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,874
Christ!

1181
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:14,910
We'll have an ambulance here in no time,
miss. Everything's gonna be OK.

1182
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,474
Where are those goddamn red lights?!

1183
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,438
Oh, God!

1184
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,636
Stop!

1185
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,276
(praying in Spanish)

1186
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,514
There has to be.

1187
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,588
It's headin' to the South Ferry loop!
lt must be goin' about 70mph!

1188
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,196
My God! Look!

1189
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,712
We'll never make it!

1190
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,709
I told you it would stop. Didn't l?

1191
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,710
42nd Street already?

1192
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,876
Get that list out on the wire.
Tell 'em it's top priority.

1193
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,877
Whaddaya got, Rico?

1194
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,959
We got positive identification
on the three dead men. Here.

1195
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,513
George Steever. Professional guy, huh?

1196
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,678
- St Louis.
- Yeah, l know how to read, Rico.

1197
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:59,229
Giuseppe Benvenuto,
alias - heh-heh - Joe Welcome.

1198
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,874
- Where's the guy who fried himself?
- No card on him.

1199
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,753
We got a confirm on his prints
from lmmigration.

1200
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:10,159
Name's Bernard Ryder. Mercenary
soldier. Between wars, l guess.

1201
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:14,751
None of these guys know how to drive
a train. It's the motorman who's missin'.

1202
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,952
Did you get that list of motormen
who were discharged?

1203
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,036
Yeah. 78 names.

1204
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,275
78?

1205
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,550
Yeah, but it's not that bad.

1206
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,399
Eight are dead. 22 were rehired.

1207
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,476
1 1 are in jail.

1208
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,556
26 moved away.

1209
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,234
One's in a mental institution. Another
is a member of the Police Department.

1210
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,874
That's our man right there.

1211
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,549
Sorry to disappoint you, Zachary,
but he was accounted for.

1212
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,240
- So how many does that leave?
- Only nine.

1213
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,837
Only nine. All right, let's get goin'.

1214
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,670
What's the name of this guy?

1215
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,756
Nathaniel Muscat.

1216
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,558
- What'd he get busted for?
- Narcotics.

1217
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,356
This way.

1218
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,752
- (Muscat) Who's there?
- Transit Police.

1219
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,836
Just a minute.

1220
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,076
What do you want?

1221
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,439
uh, nothin', fella. Our mistake.

1222
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,870
A spokesman for the Transit Authority

1223
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,389
noted that the subway car
carrying the hostages

1224
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:44,832
was stopped at the South Ferry loop
by the automatic safety features

1225
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,509
which are activated by any car
travelling at excessive speed.

1226
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,190
- Transit Authority.
- Still gotta pay.

1227
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,556
- Your name is Latimer?
- What about it?

1228
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,989
Just answer the question, would ya?

1229
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:01,398
I don't work for you guys any more.
You don't get shit from me.

1230
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,679
Can you account for your
whereabouts today, Mr Latimer?

1231
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,190
Are you tryin' to connect me
to that hijackin'? Forget it!

1232
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,994
I've been here since 2.30 this afternoon.

1233
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,873
- Are you sure?
- Sure? Ask anybody!

1234
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,437
- Don't worry, we will.
- Hold it!

1235
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,835
It's still gonna be 50 cents.

1236
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:31,836
(laughter)

1237
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,878
(knocking)

1238
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,150
- Who's that?
- Police Department.

1239
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:49,989
- Who?
- Harold Longman, it's the Transit Police.

1240
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,633
Oh, Jesus!

1241
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:53,633
Wait a minute!

1242
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,555
Just a minute!

1243
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:07,959
- How many more we gotta see today?
- Six, seven. I don't know.

1244
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,589
(Rico) Come on, Mr Longman,
we ain't got all night!

1245
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,390
- (knocking)
- I'll be right out!

1246
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,999
(toilet flushing)

1247
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,556
I hope he washes his hands
before he opens the door.

1248
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,390
- Yes, what is it?
- Harold Longman?

1249
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,478
- We'd like to ask a couple of questions.
- What about?

1250
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,673
- Will you let us in?
- We'll just take one minute of your time.

1251
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,634
I'm Lieutenant Patrone.
This is Lieutenant Garber.

1252
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,115
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

1253
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:55,590
- Nice place you got here, Mr Longman.
- Thanks.

1254
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:59,955
Can you give us an account of
your whereabouts this afternoon?

1255
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:00,910
Why?

1256
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,837
- Were you at work?
- No.

1257
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,158
- Why not?
- I work nights.

1258
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,994
- Where do you work?
- Kennedy Airport.

1259
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:13,079
- What do you do over there?
- I'm a... fork-lift operator.

1260
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,033
I got a brother-in-law does that
over in Jersey.

1261
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,151
That's interestin' work.

1262
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,352
Where were you this afternoon,
Mr Longman?

1263
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,194
- Why?
- You tell me where, l'll tell you why.

1264
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,320
I was, uh... right here.

1265
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,273
Can anyone verify that fact?

1266
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,036
You said you'd tell me why.

1267
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:38,429
- You were here all afternoon?
- I sleep in the afternoon.

1268
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,792
- All afternoon?
- Well... till about an hour ago.

1269
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,193
- But you heard about the hijackin'?
- What hijackin'?

1270
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,513
- The subway train.
- Subway...!

1271
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:56,394
- You gotta be kiddin'!
- Do l look like l'm kiddin'?

1272
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:00,433
I mean, would l be here
if l was kiddin', mister?

1273
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,279
Subway...! Who'd wanna
do a thing like that?

1274
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:06,073
- Hey, Z. You got a match?
- No.

1275
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,191
- You got a warrant?
- No.

1276
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,995
Supreme Court says you have to have
a warrant, unless l'm under arrest.

1277
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:16,716
The way things are goin', they're gonna
be changin' that in about 10 minutes.

1278
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,434
- Mr Longman, you got a match?
- No.

1279
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:22,632
That's all right. I'll get it at the stove.

1280
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,115
I'll get it.

1281
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,390
It's a little tricky.

1282
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,395
Has a tendency to explode.

1283
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,277
Rico, let's go.

1284
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,630
Thanks, Mr Longman.

1285
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,351
Mr Longman, we'll be back later.

1286
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:45,359
Yeah? Listen, l know l got a gripe
with the TA. I know l got a bum rap.

1287
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:48,790
But l wouldn't do anythin' as stupid
as what you just told me.

1288
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:53,038
What do think l am? A jerk? Do me a
favour, will ya? Get the hell outta here.

1289
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:56,311
Come on, Mr Longman. We have
to follow our leads. It's our job!

1290
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:57,919
Yeah, yeah. Big deal.

1291
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:02,397
Look, l got my rights. This is my home.
I want a little peace!

1292
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,988
Just do me a favour.
Get the hell outta here.

1293
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,390
Sorry if we bothered ya, Mr Longman.

1294
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,955
Come on, Rico.

1295
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,832
- Atchoo!
- Gesundheit!
