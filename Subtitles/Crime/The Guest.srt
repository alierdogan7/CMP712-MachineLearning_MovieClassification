Oh, no, thank you,

So, that friend of your brother's,
is he sticking around?

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,900
I don't know. I hope not. (SIGHS)

188
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,884
Why? You said you liked him.

189
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,851
I said he seemed nice.
That's not the same thing.

190
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,561
Oh, okay.

191
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,411
Why don't you like him?

192
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,730
I don't not like him.

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,243
I mean, you kind of knew Caleb.

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,886
I just know Mom and Dad
have been trying to move on

198
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,940
and it's not like they don't have
enough reminders in this town.

199
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,241
Yeah.

(SNIFFS)

201
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,220

Yeah. (SIGHS)

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,740

00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,451
(EXHALES)

207
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,286
Yeah. Totally.

208
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,804
I've got to go. (GRUNTS)

209
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,340
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.

210
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,580
- Stop. I can't...
- What!

211
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,860
No, no. Let's just hang out,
like, a little bit longer.

212
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,140
- I can't.
- Just a little bit longer.

213
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,460
I can't. Mmm-mmm. I have to go.

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,569
- You don't have to go.
- Yes, I do.

215
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,220
But I'm sure we can find some
time at Kristen's tomorrow, okay?

216
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,045
Hmm.

217

The sine is the angle of
the ship's anchor cable,

220
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,820
so the cable is the hypotenuse,
and what we need to find out

221
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,043
is the distance down
to the ocean bottom,

222
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,126
so that's the opposite. Do you see?

223
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,540
Not really.

(STAMMERING) I guess so.

Hey, how was work?

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,140
Good. Not too busy.

David, sure I can't get you a beer?

You know, I will have one. Thank you.

I'm 21 in a month.

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,940
You can have all the beer you want then,

Well, not exactly. (CHUCKLES)

Hey, don't go.
Stick around, be sociable.

Ugh, I'm kind of tired.
I think I'm gonna lay down.

239
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,690
SPENCER: Okay. Suit yourself.

240
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,340
But Allan, his name's Allan,
he's only been there for, what,

241
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,060
like, four years, but he's got a degree,

242
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,002
so, boom, suddenly he's
regional manager and I'm not.

243
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,682
And that's okay. I mean, it's okay.

244
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,700
But I know Laura, I know she's worried.

245
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,567
She wonders if I'm ever,
ever going to make any money.

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,842

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

What about you, though?
What about you? What are your plans?

250
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,020
Figured I'd get on a bus tomorrow,
head down to Florida or something

251
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,100
and start looking for work.

I've done construction work before.

know where you're going.

You're not... Impose on our...

1074
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,500
she wanted me to check out
that plastic surgeon in Florida.

1075

She wanted to know what
the connection was there.

1076
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,300

need a plastic surgeon, right?

1078
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,209

1079
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,365

so you don't have prints.

1082
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,020
I looked him up right
after Anna said that.

1083
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,460
So, maybe you don't want
people to know who you are.

1084
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,900
A doctor who would do that sort
of thing is probably pretty rare.

1085
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,620
I mean, there's probably
rules against it.

1086
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,820
But that doctor, well,
I guess he needs the money,

1087
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,690
so he'd do that kind of work.

1088
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,523
That's an interesting theory.

1089
