1
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,518
(Man coughing)

2
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,522
(Baby crying)

3
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,726
(Singing softly)

4
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,467
(Clamoring)

5
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,286
Your father?

6
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,791
Dead?

7
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,862
What's your name?

8
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,265
I don't want it anymore.

9
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,268
I'll give you a new one.

10
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,305
Leo.

11
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,806
Like a lion.

12
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,796
(Men yelling)

13
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,464
(Machine guns firing)

14
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,003
(Groans)

15
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:05,911
Leo: Vasili, fire your weapon!

16
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,381
Shit.

17
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,949
Leo: Fall back!
Vasili, get down!

18
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,987
Vasili, shoot back!

19
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:21,494
(Groaning)

20
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,463
Leo: Alexei! Cover me!

21
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,979
Soldier: Let's move out!

22
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,484
(Soldiers yelling)

23
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,586
Leo: Vasili, fire your weapon!

24
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,877
Vasili! Hey, Vasili!

25
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,681
You can come up
the stairs now. It's safe.

26
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,015
Don't be coward.

27
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,450
No one will shoot you.
(Chuckles)

28
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,053
Leo: Alexei,
just leave him alone.

29
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,693
Give him the flag.

30
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,328
Vasili: Me?
You.

31
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,729
You, too.
Come with me.

32
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,731
Me?
Yeah.

33
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,868
Tortoise: Leo, make us proud.

34
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,438
Leo: I will, sir.

35
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,441
Photographer: Okay.
Get up there. On the spire.

36
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,478
Now let's show the people

37
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,513
how Berlin has fallen
to the red army.

38
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,883
Lose the goddamn watches.

39
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,585
What?

40
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,888
Take them off. Stolen watches.
They can't be seen.

41
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,890
Alexei: Hey, Leo!

42
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,624
What?

43
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,726
Admiral, he don't
like my watches.

44
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,927
You take this.

45
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,495
Leo: He doesn't like watches?

46
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,831
No. He doesn't like
German watches.

47
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,599
Grab the flag
and get up there.

48
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,081
Yeah, come up here.
You take the flag.

49
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,637
(Leo grunting)

50
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,672
Okay, wait, wait.

51
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:15,874
Alexei: Take the flag.

52
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,875
Photographer:
Catch a big wind,

53
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,910
so we can see our flag.

54
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,645
Good, that's right.
Leo: Like this?

55
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,514
Photographer: Yeah, great.

56
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
One more.

57
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,818
You're sure?
Yeah.

58
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,720
(Choir singing military song)

59
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,472
(Song ending)

60
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,512
Leo: Do you remember
when we first met?

61
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,914
Raisa, remember
when we first met?

62
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,649
You thought that I was rude.

63
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,883
You were rude.
I was not rude.

64
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,151
You were staring at me.

65
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,986
I was...
(All laughing)

66
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,688
I was mesmerized.

67
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,057
I was mesmerized by your beauty.

68
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,059
Even had to get off
at the wrong Metro station

69
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,727
just to ask you your name.

70
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,962
I lied.

71
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,063
She did.
(All laughing)

72
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,699
She told me her name was Lena.

73
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,167
Yes. I didn't know you then.

74
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,836
So you still lied.

75
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,671
(All laughing)

76
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,540
I turn up at the park
to see my beautiful Lena.

77
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:57,642
No Lena.

78
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,244
Raisa: It was raining.

79
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,879
It was raining for a week.

80
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,247
Leo: It was raining.
(All laughing)

81
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,018
Questionable.

82
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,488
But then I found you somehow.

83
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,258
8:15 A.M. same train platform
that I met you before.

84
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,093
Then I asked you...

85
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,729
Well, I convinced you
to walk with me that day.

86
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,531
And when we got
to the school gate,

87
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,966
I held your hands,

88
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,969
and I looked into your eyes,
and I said to you,

89
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,606
(sighs)

90
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,907
"Lena,

91
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:29,975
"Lena, Lena, Lena, Lena,

92
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,209
(all laughing)

93
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,212
"Lena, Lena, Lena,

94
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,916
"I am so ready
to kiss you right now."

95
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,253
And do you know
what Lena told me?

96
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,925
"Comrade demidov,
my name is raisa."

97
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,059
(All laughing)

98
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,794
Who's raisa?

99
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,097
So now
I have to go back to work,

100
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,266
and tell all my friends
that I'm in love with raisa.

101
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,134
This beautiful raisa.

102
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,202
My friends,
they all laugh at me.

103
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,637
You were the worst,
I remember.

104
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,272
Laughed at me
because they say,

105
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,806
"last week,
we in love with Lena,

106
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,141
"this week, it's raisa..."

107
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,311
Next week, maybe Natasha.
Who knows?

108
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,113
With Leo
it's always someone new.

109
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,948
Leo: No, there will never
be somebody new.

110
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,883
There will only be you.

111
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,152
All those stories
are over for me now.

112
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,122
There is only you.

113
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,326
There will always only be you.

114
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,563
Always you.

115
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,568
(All toasting in Russian)

116
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,309
(Moaning)

117
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,843
(Bed creaking)

118
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,799
(Gunshot)

119
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:01,801
(Men shouting)

120
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,717
(Clamoring)

121
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,085
(Shouting indistinctly)

122
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,360
Alexei: This is
the veterinarian's place.

123
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,895
Stinking zoo
for a stinking traitor.

124
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,030
Is he gone?

125
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,866
You can't say
I didn't tell you, boss.

126
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,302
Collect the evidence
for me, please.

127
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,747
And you have
no idea whatsoever

128
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,116
where anatoly brodsky
might be?

129
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,222
None.

130
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,895
All I can tell you,
he was...

131
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,063
Was?

132
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,966
Is.
Is?

133
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,902
He is a good neighbor.

134
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,408
(Sighing)

135
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,379
Leo: I respect and admire
you trying to protect him,

136
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,682
but, you see,
for me it's different,

137
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,451
<i>because we are here
in your home</i>

138
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,287
<i>because your friend,
companion,</i>

139
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,259
he is a traitor, zina.

140
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,929
You understand?
And traitors have friends.

141
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,964
<i>And these "friends,"</i>

142
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,935
they are not our friends.

143
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
(Grunts)

144
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,144
Do I have
to spell this out for you?

145
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,147
Zina,

146
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,016
now is the time to say

147
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,785
something.

148
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,057
Anything.

149
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,811
(Girl humming)

150
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,146
(Gasps)

151
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,380
(Shushing)

152
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,817
Mama! Mama!

153
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,822
Leo: No shooting.

154
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,126
(Woman gasps)

155
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,128
Girl: Mama.

156
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,328
Don't move.

157
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,101
Semyon okun?
Yes.

158
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,666
Agent: There's no one else
in here.

159
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,311
Anatoly brodsky,
do you know him?

160
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,353
Yes, I know brodsky.
Right.

161
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,815
Do you know where he is?

162
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,917
Brodsky? In Moscow, I think.

163
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,552
No, he's not in Moscow.

164
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,521
We have information
that tells us

165
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,356
that he's staying
here with you.

166
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,524
No.
Oh, it's...

167
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,395
Wait, you said something.

168
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,964
Woman: Mmm-mmm.

169
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,833
Yes, you did. You did.
You said something.

170
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,934
No.

171
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,202
What did you say?

172
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,452
Alexei: Yuri, Nikolai,
spread out!

173
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,899
Leo: Brodsky!

174
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,408
Brodsky!

175
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,123
Don't fuck with me.

176
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,992
Put your hands
where I can see them.

177
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,996
Come on.
Get it over with.

178
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,164
Put your hands on your head.

179
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,167
Don't be stupid.

180
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,434
Shoot me.

181
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,535
Put your hands on your head.

182
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,136
Come on, shoot me!

183
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,638
(Groaning)

184
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,040
Kill me! Kill me!

185
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,643
Come on, kill me!

186
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,152
Alexei!

187
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,154
(Grunting)

188
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,559
(Gun firing)

189
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,998
Kill me!

190
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,402
(Groaning)

191
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,343
Alexei! Alexei!

192
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,054
Alexei: I got this.

193
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,523
Nikolas!

194
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,993
(Brodsky panting)

195
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,702
Leo: He's fucking crazy.

196
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,674
Semyon: Please, I ask you.
I beg you. don't do this.

197
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,642
Please, don't kill my family,
my children.

198
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,210
These are
the future of Russia.

199
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,513
Please! No, please, I beg you!

200
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,348
What is he doing?

201
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,617
Please, no, don't hurt her.
I ask you, please!

202
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,252
No! No!

203
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,453
Please! I ask you, please!

204
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,289
No!

205
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,191
(Semyon bawling)

206
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,193
Leo: Vasili!

207
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,663
Leo: Hey! Vasili!

208
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,532
(Gun firing)

209
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,200
What the fuck are you doing?

210
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,202
Huh?

211
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,539
Making...
Making an example.

212
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,742
You're doing what?

213
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,077
Making example.

214
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,578
Making example of what?

215
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,480
These people are traitors.

216
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,582
Maybe now they can grow up and
learn a lesson from all this.

217
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,750
What did you fucking say?

218
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,552
They can learn
a lesson from this.

219
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,524
Learn something from you,
little shit? Huh?

220
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,160
What are they gonna
fucking learn from you?

221
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:40,398
You fucking coward!
Children! Fucking children!

222
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,566
What's your fucking answer?

223
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:42,734
Alexei: Leo.

224
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,403
(Girls sobbing)

225
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,374
I want men!

226
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,575
Leo.

227
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,178
Shit.

228
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,282
Get him out of here, because
I will fucking kill him.

229
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,585
Do you understand me?
Move him now.

230
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,619
Get these children
out of here.

231
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:02,821
What is wrong with you people?

232
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,123
Alexei!

233
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,358
Alexei!

234
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,595
Take care of this.

235
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,662
Shit!

236
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,549
(Door closing)

237
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,622
(Leo sighs)

238
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,191
Do you have any relatives
that live nearby?

239
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,095
(Sniffling)

240
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,830
(Agents talking in distance)

241
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,867
(Man speaking Russian on pa)

242
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,596
(Train approaching)

243
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,543
Have you tried that
with a kopeck?

244
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,228
It's best with a kopeck.

245
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,331
Let me show you, okay?

246
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,933
Not here.

247
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,202
Little further down the line
would be better.

248
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,674
What's your name?
Jora.

249
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,252
(Exhales)

250
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,273
(Door closes)

251
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,282
You can save yourself

252
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,918
a lot of pain

253
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,455
and unnecessary suffering
if you talk to me. Hmm?

254
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,857
Yes.

255
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,696
Who are you working for?

256
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:37,435
Anna ivanovna akmatova.

257
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,005
She has a dog,
which will not eat.

258
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,743
Mattias borisky rakowski.

259
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,945
His terrier is going blind.

260
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,780
(Chuckles)

261
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:53,017
I'm a veterinarian.
I'm nothing more.

262
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,889
If you are so innocent,

263
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,792
why do you run?

264
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,595
Hmm?

265
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,497
That is a very good question.

266
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:13,504
I run because
you were following me.

267
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,473
When you are followed,
you are arrested.

268
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,774
And when you are arrested,

269
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,644
you are already guilty.

270
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,583
So you tell me.

271
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,019
Why did I run?

272
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,957
Do you have any idea

273
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,693
what happens

274
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:42,633
in this room next door here,
to a man like you,

275
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,035
when you don't talk?

276
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:48,439
A child knows
what will happen to me.

277
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,778
Should he cross?

278
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,513
All: No!

279
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:56,814
Raisa: What should he do?

280
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,016
All:<i> Look both ways!</i>

281
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,653
Yes. Good.

282
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,689
Because our leader
loves his children,

283
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,825
want them all to be safe.

284
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,694
Dr. zarubin:
This is sodium thiopental.

285
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,330
In less than a minute,

286
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,892
he will only
be able to speak the truth.

287
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:16,601
Okay.

288
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,572
Little bit more.

289
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:25,343
Wait. Wait.

290
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,410
(Muffled grunting)

291
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,458
Leo: Vasili,
ask your questions.

292
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,793
Vasili: Okay. I want the name
of every person

293
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,029
passing you information
from the British embassy.

294
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,102
(Banging on door)

295
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:53,971
Leo.

296
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,907
Leo.

297
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,042
(Banging continues)

298
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,110
What is it?

299
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,478
Raisa: Someone at the door.

300
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,512
Where?

301
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,156
Major kuzmin?

302
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,593
I came as fast as I could.

303
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,498
There has been
a terrible accident.

304
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,769
Alexei's son
has been hit by a train.

305
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:28,773
I thought you wanted to
hear it from me first.

306
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,110
A train?

307
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,748
Kuzmin: You and
alexei andreyevich

308
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,518
came through the war together,
didn't you?

309
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Leo: Yes.

310
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,688
Kuzmin: We value alexei.

311
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,957
And we do everything
we can to protect him.

312
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,995
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.

313
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:54,598
You protect him?

314
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,700
The poor man
must be beside himself.

315
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,936
He's claiming
his son was murdered.

316
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,573
Stalin tells us that murder

317
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,575
is strictly
a capitalist disease.

318
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:08,012
But alexei is
flirting with treason.

319
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,747
So you know
what has to be done.

320
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,456
I will find someone on the
third floor to deal with this.

321
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,524
And who better
to do it than you?

322
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,900
Done.

323
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:32,603
Kuzmin:<i> Your brother.</i>

324
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:34,772
<i>Help him help himself.</i>

325
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,178
Alexei.
Leo.

326
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,251
Come in.

327
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,056
I am so sorry.

328
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:56,260
I have been personally asked

329
00:24:56,262 --> 00:25:00,264
to share
the official report with you.

330
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:04,201
"Yesterday morning,

00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,013
"He was found fully clothed.

(Women sobbing)

337

"Further examination

"of the victim's body

My boy was found naked.

340
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:31,729
No. He was found
fully clothed.

341
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,163
"Further examination..."

342
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:36,166
A train doesn't undress a boy.

"Further examination

"we believe the cause of death
was indeed a tragic accident."

349
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,288
Nina: Why would a report

350
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,790
even bother to mention
that he was clothed?

351
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,926
Leo: This was signed
by Major kuzmin.

352
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,227
He is the department

353
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,228

Your godson, Leo!
And you do nothing?

357
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,773
I am sorry.

358
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,141
Read the report.

359
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,643
To find out what?

360
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,078
Someone has
slaughtered your son.

361
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,212
Do something!

362
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,747
Alexei: Nina!

363
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,115
Nina: Someone has
slaughtered your son!

364
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,318
Someone has
slaughtered your son!

365

Someone has
slaughtered your son!

366
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,122
(Nina sobbing)

367
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:40,864
This is crazy.

368
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,334
You cannot do this.

369
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:46,737
I have men downstairs!
They can hear everything.

370
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,005
There is a reason
why they sent me.

371
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,173
You understand?

372
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:52,876
You have to be quiet.

373
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,120
They wouldn't let me
see him, Leo.

374
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,022
They wouldn't let me
see my boy.

375
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,024
Alexei, please,
will you just...

376
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,892
No, you tell me.
Read the file.

377
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:09,927
Tell me.

378
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,797
What should I tell her?
My wife?

379
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,166
You tell her
whatever it takes

380
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:20,904
to protect every single
body in that room.

381
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:24,174
Everybody in there,
who you love,

382
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,310
you tell them
whatever it takes.

383
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,811
Do you understand?

384
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:33,283
And you let him go.

385
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:39,690
Alexei, there can be
no murder in paradise.

386
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:40,891
(Sobs)

387
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,192
Remember?

388
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,937
There's a witness, Leo.

389
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,274
Excuse me?

390
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,279
A woman.

391
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,085
What do you mean?

392
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,056
She saw that man.

393
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:14,692
She saw the man
who took my boy.

394
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,260
She saw him.

395
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:17,361
You have a witness?

396
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,796
Yes.

397
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,164
And she will testify?

398
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:23,100
Maybe. Her windows
overlook the tracks.

399
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,470
She saw jora with a man.

400
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,112
My boy was murdered.

401
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:37,448
You don't know this.
I know it.

402
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,917
And you don't lie to me,
because you know it, too.

403
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,119
You know it.

404
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,756
Leo: I want the coroner
to do a full autopsy

405
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,458
on the andreyev child.

406
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,810
Kuzmin:<i> So I heard</i>

407
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:09,179
there was a problem
with vasili in kimov.

408
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,449
I apologize.

409
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,420
You're only flesh and blood.

410
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,922
Striking a fellow officer

411
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,824
can bring you
the kind of attention

412
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,159
you could live without.

413
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:27,998
But you did a great service
by talking to the andreyevs.

414
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,369
Alexei will thank you.
One day.

415
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,239
By the way,

416
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,110
brodsky. Full confession.

417
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,899
He gave us seven names.

418
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:05,335
Six went to others.

419
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,171
Considering you're
one of my most

420
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,839
thorough investigators,

421
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,842
I gave you the toughest
nut of the bunch.

422
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,447
So, you asked for a full
autopsy of that boy.

423
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,183
What's his name?

424
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:21,418
Jora alexei andreyevich.

425
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,486
Jora?
<i>Da.</i>

426
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,091
Kuzmin: This one is yours.

427
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:31,028
We don't have much,
as you'll see.

428
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,064
So you are to collect
further information.

429
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:37,134
And if brodsky
was telling the truth,

430
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:40,904
if that individual
is a traitor,

431
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:43,907
you are to arrest them
and bring them here.

432
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,512
The usual process.

433
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,119
Any questions?

434
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,153
Ivan: You know, if reading
was an olympic event...

435
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,575
Raisa!

436
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,577
Raisa!

437
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,479
Raisa!

438
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,150
No, no, please, no.
Zoya: Please help me!

439
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,585
No, no, no, please.
Zoya: Raisa!

440
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,455
She has no...

441
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,223
What is the charge?

442
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,291
(Protesting indistinctly)

443
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:35,293
Zoya: Raisa!

444
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,436
Why her?

445
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:47,971
Because she couldn't keep

446
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,653
her goddamn opinion
to herself. That's why.

447
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:59,583
Ivan, maybe we should go
our separate ways.

448
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,319
Raisa.

449
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,489
(Indistinct)

450
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,006
(Metro approaching)

451
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,096
Tortoise: Is she a traitor?

452
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,199
They have a confession.

453
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,633
Mmm.

454
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,738
And who took this confession?

455
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,141
A colleague of mine.

456
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,413
Could it have been manufactured?

457
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,150
Of course.

458
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,753
Do you have evidence?

459
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,725
No.

460
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,394
So what are you going to do?

461
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:58,135
If I do not denounce raisa,
and she is a traitor,

462
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:01,304
they have something on her
that I don't know about,

463
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,073
I don't find or...

464
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,076
(Sighing)

465
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,248
(Clears throat)

466
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,219
Obviously, we are all guilty
by association, regardless.

467
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,556
What did you expect
when you came here?

468
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,757
That we didn't mind dying?

469
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,628
That raisa would be saved?

470
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,198
But if you don't denounce her,

471
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:33,170
we will die.
All four of us.

472
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,140
But the only difference,

473
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:40,677
that you would die
knowing in your heart

474
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,680
that you did the right thing.

475
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,552
And so you calculate.

476
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,456
One dead. Or four.

477
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,792
One dead. Or four.

478
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,562
(Knocking on door)

479
00:34:58,564 --> 00:34:59,796
Are you expecting somebody?

480
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,599
It's raisa.

481
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,835
She always eats with us
on wednesdays.

482
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:09,806
Anna.
Oh, raisa.

483
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,709
Good to see you.

484
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,746
He was working nearby.

485
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,151
For once we can eat
as a family.

486
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,461
How was school?

487
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,763
Good.
Good.

488
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,700
And you've come here...

489
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:39,236
Did you walk
straight from work?

490
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,671
Normally, I would be,

491
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:42,672
but I had
a doctor's appointment...

492
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:43,907
Doctor's appointment?

493
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,229
...at the kuzminski prospekt.
Yes.

494
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,546
You sick?

495
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:50,647
All right?

496
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,715
Yes.

497
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,550
Not sick?
No.

498
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,289
Why do you go doctor?

499
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,928
I wanted to tell you
when we're on our own.

500
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:08,899
Why?

501
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:12,736
We are all family here.

502
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,374
We don't keep secrets
from one another.

503
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,782
I'm pregnant.

504
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,720
Anna: That's wonderful news.

505
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:31,922
(Chuckling)

506
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:39,229
(Both chuckling)

507
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,500
Anna: Congratulations.

508
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,910
Hmm.

509
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,585
Excuse me.

510
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,587
Anna: We are going
to be grandparents.

511
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,275
(Man speaking indistinctly
on pa)

512
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,698
(Banging on door)

513
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,737
What?

514
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,948
Kuzmin sent us.
We're here to help.

515
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:43,053
Wow!

516
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:47,090
Very nice apartment.

517
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:51,795
(Chuckles)

518
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:53,930
(Door closing)

519
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,744
What are you doing?

520
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,415
There is better way
than that.

521
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,984
That is not the way.

522
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,388
You feel the cushions.

523
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,628
You think it was me,
don't you?

524
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:31,568
But no one
ever listens to me.
don't you know that?

525
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,552
(Thudding)

526
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,149
(Door banging)

527
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:20,950
(Eva pleading indistinctly)

528
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,020
Eva: Ivan, please!

529
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,525
Ivan, please!

530
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,026
Ivan: Gentlemen, please.

531
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,127
She teaches domestic arts.

532
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,495
Sewing.
(Speaking Russian)

533
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:33,737
What could she have possibly...

534
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
(Gasps)

535
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:52,916
It's fine, it's fine.

536
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,759
Purse.

537
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:09,732
(Gasps)

538
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,677
(Slams door)

539
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,078
(Breathing heavily)

540
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,176
They took one of my
colleagues today.

541
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,281
Eva. Friend of mine.

542
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,752
Do you know whose name

543
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:06,122
ended up on my desk?

544
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,061
Can you imagine?

545
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,199
No.

546
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,300
No?

547
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,606
You.

548
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:25,241
You have been named.

549
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29,212
Do you want to know by who?

550
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:31,915
Hmm?

551
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,151
Anatoly brodsky.

552
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,254
Do you know him?

553
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:45,562
Does it matter?

554
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:46,996
Yes, it matters.

555
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,266
It matters to me.

556
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:53,136
Mmm-hmm.

557
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:57,607
They asked me to denounce you.

558
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:04,815
Raisa,

559
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,118
are you a spy?

560
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:15,592
No.

561
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,194
No.

562
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:21,264
(Inhaling deeply)

563
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:31,975
You do know what happens
to us now. Right?

564
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:35,612
Yes.

565
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:41,918
It's just our turn.

566
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:52,862
Coroner: <i>Demidov, you asked
for the autopsy report.</i>

567
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,364
<i>I was forbidden
to show it to you.</i>

568
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,966
Doesn't matter.
It's not important now.

569
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,334
I thought you might
want to know.

570
00:43:58,336 --> 00:43:59,669
There's been another one.

571
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,175
Another what?

572
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,177
A train accident.

573
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,981
What is it?

574
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,983
Two boys.
Found by the tracks.
Both naked.

575
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,418
Same cause of death.

576
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,853
Which is?
Drowning.

577
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:18,354
Leo:<i> Drowning?</i>

578
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,889
Coroner: <i>But there are
no rivers, no lakes</i>

579
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,125
<i>next to the places
where they were found.</i>

580
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:24,127
<i>And around the Iris,
hemorrhaging.</i>

581
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:26,796
<i>As with strangulation.</i>

582
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:27,830
<i>There was</i>
<i>one big difference</i>
<i>between the boys.</i>

583
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,766
Leo:<i> What's that?</i>

584
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:32,835
Coroner: <i>Jora andreyevich,
he had visual signs of trauma.</i>

585
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,370
<i>As if by torture.</i>

586
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,975
Cuts, Leo.
Targeted.
Not random.

587
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:43,946
<i>It was almost
with surgical precision.</i>

588
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,849
<i>Stomach removed.
Missing.</i>

589
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,851
<i>Water spilling from the boy.</i>

590
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,788
This is not the work
of some average idiot.

591
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,128
You are sure you don't want
to reexamine your report?

592
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,830
There is no need.

593
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:03,366
I found nothing.

594
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:04,368
Leo,

595
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:11,974
I am sure you realize
what this means?

596
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:13,743
Major kuzmin,

597
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:17,380
I have stood here
for the past 10 minutes

598
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,016
telling you exactly
the same thing.

599
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,819
Because it is the truth.

600
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:27,323
I found nothing.

601
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:31,027
Raisa demidova

602
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,429
is innocent.

603
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:40,203
(Thumps desk)

604
00:45:58,156 --> 00:46:00,156
(Banging on door)

605
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,290
(Whimpering)

606
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:03,426
(Door breaks open)

607
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:12,835
This is all you can take.

608
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:14,504
You carry nothing
on your person,

609
00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:16,139
except your clothes
and your papers.

610
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:21,077
Alexei, why did you...

611
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,246
(Agent shouts)
That's fine.

612
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:26,182
That's okay.
All right.

613
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:28,484
Please, give me five minutes,
because she's...

614
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,086
Alexei: You know
the rules, Leo.

615
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:32,021
Please, five minutes.
Just get dressed.

616
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:33,256
You have two minutes.

617
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:35,158
Leo: Want five.

618
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,559
(Agent shouting orders)

619
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:38,261
You fucking dog!
Don't you fucking touch her.

620
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:39,428
Alexei, I will put him through
the fucking window.

621
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,830
It's fine. It's fine.

622
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:42,098
Leo: Jesus.

623
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,499
Let her be.

624
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,967
Agent: Here.

625
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:52,542
Raisa: No! No, Leo! No, Leo!

626
00:46:52,544 --> 00:46:54,977
Leo: Where are you taking her?

627
00:46:57,882 --> 00:47:00,917
No, Leo! No!

628
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:18,367
Leo: Raisa?

629
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:19,836
Raisa, are you there?

630
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:21,103
Raisa: Yes.

631
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,306
Leo: Did they hurt you?
Raisa: No.

632
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:26,242
Good. Do exactly as they say.

633
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:27,977
Raisa?

634
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,112
You must not be scared.
All right?

635
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,117
Hey, I understand.
Let go of me!

636
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,252
(Grunting)

637
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:37,553
Let go!

638
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,155
I understand.

639
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:40,857
Come here.
(Sobbing)

640
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,525
It's okay, it's okay.

641
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,194
(Guns cocking)
She is pregnant!

642
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,929
Raisa: What are they doing?

643
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,531
It's all right. Shh.

644
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,333
This is where we wait
for the truck, okay?

645
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:52,902
Look, you see?
This is where the truck comes.

646
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:54,370
They pick us up. They take
us away. Do you understand?

647
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,538
But where are we going?

648
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,139
I don't know.

649
00:47:57,141 --> 00:48:00,176
It's okay. She's pregnant.<i> Da?</i>

650
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,378
She's pregnant.

651
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,648
Leo, where are we going?

652
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,250
Where are we going?
(Door banging)

653
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:18,427
I thought you'd like
to see the place.
One last time.

654
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:21,898
I'm sentimental like that.

655
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:25,501
Raisa. Raisa.

656
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,242
You're going to volsk,

657
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,644
which, from what I've heard,

658
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:35,912
is pretty much
the asshole of the earth,

659
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:38,047
and join the militsia.

660
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:39,448
You know, all he had to do
was to denounce you,

661
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,183
and in a year

662
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:42,905
the whole building
would be kissing his ass.

663
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:45,221
It was the only option.

664
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,690
But you won't listen.

665
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:51,594
Enjoy your new life.

666
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:20,423
You know,
this whole thing

667
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:23,459
was just a test
of blind obedience.

668
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:26,562
You should have given me up.

669
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,599
That's what wives are for.

670
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,701
(Whistle blows)

671
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:23,619
(Whistle blows)

672
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:45,041
What are you waiting for?

673
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:50,379
<i>I only heard three days ago
you were coming.</i>

674
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:54,050
It's unusual.

675
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:55,852
Because I made no requests
for additional men.

676
00:50:57,822 --> 00:51:01,524
And I'm a little confused
about the orders.

677
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:06,462
The militsia
is a significant demotion

678
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:08,064
for a man of your stature.

679
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:10,132
We go where we are needed.

680
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:11,494
Nesterov: Do you know
what I heard?

681
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,205
I heard they made you take off
a dozen stolen watches

682
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:18,441
before they handed you
that flag.

683
00:51:24,115 --> 00:51:27,383
There are no advantages
to being in militsia.

684
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:30,586
Once an apartment is found,
you will be assigned.

685
00:51:31,823 --> 00:51:34,557
But it's
a very long waiting list.

686
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:38,227
You start tomorrow.

687
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:52,875
(Music playing on radio)

688
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,423
(Baby crying)

689
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:21,604
Basurov: The bar
doesn't give credit.

690
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,673
Toilet is down the hall.

691
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:25,741
(Coughs)

692
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:35,751
(Water running)

693
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,235
(School bell ringing)

694
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:56,505
Comrade director,
raisa demidova.

695
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,274
I have been assigned here.

696
00:52:58,276 --> 00:53:00,910
Would you be so kind
to show me to my classroom?

697
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:01,912
Fine.

698
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,622
Here is your classroom.

699
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:17,960
If we need you
for anything else,

700
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:19,195
we will tell you.

701
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:27,836
Nesterov: Demidov.

702
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,813
Man: Varlam, wait! Varlam!

703
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,617
Goodbye, general nesterov.

704
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,319
Goodbye, varlam.

705
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,987
Man: Let's go, varlam.

706
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:46,889
Nesterov: It's tragic.

707
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,892
But even the party
can't be responsible

708
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,895
for the acts
of a mental defective.

709
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,638
Your rank is in my hands,
you see.

710
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:05,241
Yes, sir.

711
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:26,929
We are here.

712
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:51,353
It's a boy.

713
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,790
He was found naked.

714
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,961
They say he looks
like he was tortured.

715
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:08,971
I have two kids myself.
It makes me sick.

716
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:27,556
Dr. tyapkin:
It's been here a while.

717
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:28,924
Nesterov: What's a while?

718
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:31,860
Dr. tyapkin: Week. two.

719
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:36,065
It could be anyone
from the orphanage.

720
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:37,766
Uh-huh.

721
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,655
Nesterov:
Perhaps he has a twin.

722
00:55:42,656 --> 00:55:43,639
Dr. tyapkin: A brother would
be good for identification.

723
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:46,742
Leo: Excuse me, general.

724
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:49,478
How old is he, about eight?
Eight years old?

725
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,451
He has blood in his eyes.

726
00:55:56,987 --> 00:56:00,622
See? Is blood.

727
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:03,792
Hemorrhaging.
You see it in strangulations.

728
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:05,394
But look at his neck.

729
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:06,662
He has no track marks
on his throat.

730
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:10,466
So, what else can cause that?

731
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:11,628
You also see it in drownings.

732
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,769
Drowning. Yes.

733
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:15,571
Do you see
any water around here?

734
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:22,444
About 6 kilometers east.
The river in tobol.

735
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,546
6 kilometers.

736
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:29,618
So, a drowned boy
walks 6 kilometers?

737
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,388
This is little boy.

738
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,724
Look, you see this cut here?

739
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,060
It seems purposeful, no?

740
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,696
They are.
Someone knew their anatomy.

741
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:43,665
Organs have been removed.

742
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:46,835
And so you say organs
have been removed

743
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,103
from this child's body?

744
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:54,977
So it's what?
We look for butcher?

745
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:56,712
We look for a hunter?

746
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:58,147
Dr. tyapkin:
More like a surgeon.

747
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,917
More like surgeon?

748
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:06,822
More like surgeon.

749
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,958
Will you excuse us?

750
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:17,699
Why are you here?

751
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:20,002
A child was murdered
in Moscow.

752
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,937
What are you doing here?

753
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,639
Water came out of his mouth.
Same as this child!

754
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:24,973
Are you still
working for the mgb?

755
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:26,041
No, I'm not mgb.

756
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,043
I think you are.

757
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:28,544
Why are you here?

758
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:30,846
Why are these children
so important to Moscow?

759
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:32,548
Believe me, these children
are not important to Moscow.

760
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:35,184
Whatever it is
you've been sent here to do...

761
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:38,554
Remember, you are not
in Moscow anymore.

762
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:40,856
Here, we have an arrangement.

763
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:44,493
If you do anything
to endanger my team.

764
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:46,962
If you report anything
which undermines my authority.

765
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:51,800
If you portray my officers
as incompetent.

766
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,036
If you do
any of these things,

767
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:00,242
I will kill you myself.

768
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,846
Dr. tyapkin: General nesterov!

769
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:06,949
He has identification papers.

770
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:11,820
Isaac rudensky.

771
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,990
From the gorsky school
in oblast x.

772
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:17,993
Where exactly is oblast x?

773
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:20,028
50 kilometers east.

774
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,063
Seven stations down the line.

775
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:22,564
(Leo whistles)

776
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:23,999
General,
if he came by train,

777
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,734
maybe the ticket master

778
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:27,136
will recall
seeing him with someone.

779
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,538
Perhaps.

780
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:34,042
Where's the ticket master?

781
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:35,777
Budenny: Aleksander.
He's over there.

782
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:48,557
Aleksander,

783
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,261
when you found
the body last night,

784
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:55,063
you were taking a walk,
you say?

785
00:58:56,267 --> 00:58:57,267
What's wrong?

786
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,006
What? Are you okay?

787
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,275
(Gasps)

788
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:12,247
Nesterov: Or perhaps you were
doing something else?

789
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:15,751
(Whimpers)

790
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:30,299
Man: Get in.

791
00:59:32,636 --> 00:59:33,636
Now.

792
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,175
(Phone ringing)

793
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,317
Yes?

794
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,618
Vasili:<i> Put her on the phone.</i>

795
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,659
Yes?

796
00:59:57,661 --> 01:00:00,162
<i>So, raisa, I've been thinking.</i>

797
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,833
Vasili.

798
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:07,836
<i>You're getting a very
bad deal here. You know?</i>

799
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:10,138
<i>I mean, for all these years,</i>

800
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,374
good little mousewife

801
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:14,843
and look at where
you find yourself.

802
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:19,214
Vasili, you know me.

803
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:22,618
What have I done?

804
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:25,721
<i>My point exactly.
So here's what I propose.</i>

805
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:27,856
These guys will put you on
the next train to Moscow,

806
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:30,092
and you can have
your old job back.

807
01:00:30,094 --> 01:00:33,395
I will personally find you
a nice little place to live.

808
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:35,197
<i>Assuming, of course,
you wouldn't rather</i>

809
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,032
<i>move into your old apartment</i>

810
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:38,400
with me.

811
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,238
Leave Leo.

812
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,073
Come on, raisa,
you never fooled me.

813
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:47,195
All you ever wanted from him
was his head in a basket.

814
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:55,050
No.

815
01:00:58,255 --> 01:00:59,321
No?

816
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:03,258
No.

817
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,235
<i>Okay. In that case...</i>

818
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:15,370
<i>You see that bald guy
in a blue suit?</i>

819
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:19,074
Yes.

820
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:20,709
<i>You know
what would be really nice?</i>

821
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:23,445
No.

822
01:01:25,749 --> 01:01:26,782
Give him the phone.

823
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:31,219
(Stammers) What?

824
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,122
<i>Give him the phone.</i>

825
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,470
(Whimpering)

826
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,110
(Shuddering)

827
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:11,793
Raisa?

828
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:49,932
Where are you going? Huh?
Where are you going?

829
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,800
Away. Yes.
Away?

830
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:53,502
Wait, listen to me,
listen to me.

831
01:02:53,504 --> 01:02:55,804
Whatever you feel about me,

832
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:57,906
whatever is going on,
whatever you are thinking,

833
01:02:57,908 --> 01:02:59,875
we are here now.
That is it.

834
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:01,476
This is where
we find ourselves.

835
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:03,545
There is nothing
that we can do about this.

836
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,349
I would rather
spend a lifetime

837
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,985
in a shithole like this
with you

838
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:13,288
than spend one minute
in Moscow without you.

839
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,891
Say that to someone
who doesn't know you.

840
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:16,992
What are you gonna do
without papers?

841
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:18,326
Did you forget something? Huh?

842
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:19,361
Yes, you forget these?

843
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:21,163
Give me my papers.

844
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:25,834
You know what happens to a
woman like you without papers?

845
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:28,270
She gets stopped.
She gets arrested.

846
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:30,205
She gets questioned.
Then guess what happens.

847
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:31,373
(Grunts)

848
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,210
Give me my papers.

849
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,418
(Man shouts in Russian)

850
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,258
(Shouting in Russian)

851
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:53,361
(Whistle blows)

852
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:06,141
Don't you ever do that again.

853
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,876
Ever. Do you...

854
01:04:07,878 --> 01:04:09,311
Huh?

855
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:12,180
So I'm your prisoner now?
Like everybody else?

856
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,582
(Shouts)

857
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,085
You want to kill me? Huh?

858
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:18,320
(Grunts)

859
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:22,257
You had your chance in Moscow.

860
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:23,925
(Panting)

861
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:26,027
The dinner we had
with your parents.

862
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,363
I heard you
when I came in the hallway.

863
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:31,333
<i>Your beloved father
was pretty convincing.</i>

864
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:33,602
<i>"Four lives against one."</i>

865
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:35,637
<i>I just stood there
hearing him over and over.</i>

866
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:38,373
"Four lives against one.
Four lives against one."

867
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:41,109
What about four lives
against two?

868
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:43,645
Would you be so quick
to kill your own child?

869
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:47,249
What do you mean by that?
What are you saying?

870
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:53,221
Raisa, what do you mean
by this? Why you say that?

871
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,160
No.

872
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:03,498
No, no, you...

873
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,136
You're not pregnant?

874
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,007
I'm not pregnant.

875
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:19,414
Are you saying
you're not pregnant?

876
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,050
Would you have stood up
for me if I wasn't?

877
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,594
I didn't want to die, Leo.

878
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:41,636
(Exhales)

879
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:46,508
(Sniffling)

880
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,315
Why are you saying this?

881
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:08,063
Huh?
(Banging)

882
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:13,168
Why?

883
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,975
That story you love so much.

884
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:22,410
When we first met.
And I lied

885
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:25,480
and I said
that my name was Lena.

886
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:29,751
"Lena, Lena, Lena."
So romantic.

887
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:35,123
I gave you a false name

888
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:37,492
because you had mgb
written all over you,

889
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,060
and I was terrified.

890
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:44,432
When you asked me
to marry you,

891
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:46,634
I cried for one week.

892
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,773
And then I said "yes."

893
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:55,377
I married you out of fear

894
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:58,113
for what would happen to me
if I said "no."

895
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:00,615
You don't mean that.

896
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:09,424
I married you
because that's what people do.

897
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:12,227
They put up. They tolerate.

898
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:15,296
They do whatever
they need to do to survive.

899
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,767
"Marry me," you said.

900
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:22,704
What choice did I have?

901
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:28,610
What choice did I have?

902
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:32,814
(Sniffling)

903
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:53,134
Homosexuality
is a serious crime.

904
01:07:58,075 --> 01:08:00,442
Please, just say...

905
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:03,511
What do you want?

906
01:08:06,116 --> 01:08:08,183
A list of men in this town

907
01:08:08,185 --> 01:08:10,285
who have had sex
with other men.

908
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:13,688
What?

909
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:17,492
Men who have had sex
with younger men.

910
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:18,827
With boys.

911
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:21,297
What?

912
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:27,368
Fifteen years in the gulag
is a long time.

913
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:31,473
Even if you survive the camps,
you'll be disgraced.

914
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:35,276
Aleksander: Please,
just tell me what to do.

915
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:38,346
If you open the door for us,

916
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,751
maybe your issue

917
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,488
can remain a secret.

918
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:54,329
Just a few names, aleksander.

919
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:25,426
(Pleading in Russian)

920
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:47,549
(Speaking Russian)

921
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,586
(Protesting in Russian)

922
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:55,557
(Whistle blows)

923
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:14,943
(Brakes screeching)

924
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:17,979
(Children exclaiming)

925
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:39,934
(Crowd murmuring)

926
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:23,645
Leo.

927
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:27,949
Were you followed?

928
01:11:29,552 --> 01:11:30,652
Are you sure?

929
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,922
What are you doing here?

930
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:37,558
You tell me.

931
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:42,730
What are you doing here?

932
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:44,999
Aleksander could
not have killed this boy.

933
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:47,935
It's not possible.

934
01:11:49,572 --> 01:11:53,007
When I saw jora,
he had the same cuts and marks

935
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:55,677
as this child.

936
01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:59,414
Whoever killed this little boy,

937
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:01,783
killed alexei's child, too.
I know it.

938
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,019
It's the truth.

939
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:07,989
Just have to prove it.

940
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,594
I must.

941
01:12:13,596 --> 01:12:15,697
I have to.
I have to prove it.

942
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,499
Leo,

943
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,401
do you know what people
get around here

944
01:12:20,403 --> 01:12:22,370
when they demand the truth?

945
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:25,907
Do you?

946
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:29,410
They get terror.

947
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:35,016
Raisa, we are already dead.

948
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,009
Nesterov: Come inside.

949
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,847
Leo: The killer,
he's a traveler.

950
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:07,482
Hmm.

951
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:09,751
We found a little boy

952
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:12,620
10 minutes' walk
from the track.

953
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:14,555
I'm thinking how else
could he get here,

954
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,591
if it was not for train?

955
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:18,393
And then the boy in Moscow.

956
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,461
Again with Moscow.

957
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:23,865
This boy in Moscow is the son
of a very good friend of mine.

958
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:27,769
My brother.

959
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:30,104
I was sent to his house
to read official report.

960
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,906
I had to tell his family

961
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:33,541
that his son died
of tragic accident.

962
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:36,010
And I lied.

963
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:39,113
So I'm thinking, how many
more children have to die?

964
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:41,482
Get swept under the carpet.

965
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:44,085
Covered up by party dogs
like you and I.

966
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:47,855
And their blood
is on our hands.

967
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:49,891
And this animal,
he will not stop killing.

968
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:51,626
This will not stop.

969
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:52,794
He will keep killing
and killing.

970
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:54,162
Enough!

971
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:00,168
What do you want?

972
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:01,436
Me? I would like to stop him.

973
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:03,671
A ghost.

974
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,940
Ghost? No, it's not ghost.

975
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,009
Describe him to me then.

976
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:10,445
I can't.

977
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,481
I can't describe him.

978
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:16,717
But there is a witness.

979
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,887
I must go back to Moscow
and speak with her.

980
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:21,989
And you must gather the
records of all dead children

981
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:24,559
from Moscow to Leningrad.

982
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:27,879
Me?

983
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,120
And why would
I do that for you?

984
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:39,507
Raisa: Inessa, your boys,

985
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,642
do they walk to school
by themselves?

986
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,045
Normally, yes.

987
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:47,682
But this week,
with those poor children,

988
01:14:47,684 --> 01:14:49,050
either myself or...

989
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,987
Raisa: And from here
to school, it seems

990
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,490
the shortest way
is through the forest.

991
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:56,891
Is that the way they go?

992
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:00,027
Usually.

993
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:02,263
But again, this week,

994
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:05,066
the way through town
seems safer.

995
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:06,767
Raisa: Hmm. Yes, of course.

996
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:12,573
But now that the killer
has been caught,

997
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,208
will they be going
through the forest

998
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,177
by themself tomorrow as usual?

999
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:46,207
(Exhales)

1000
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,109
Morning.

1001
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:49,176
Morning.

1002
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:56,551
Where are you headed to today?

1003
01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:58,686
Nowhere.

1004
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:05,226
Just waiting
to buy some stamps.

1005
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:08,796
But the kiosk isn't open yet.

1006
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:11,666
Collect stamps?

1007
01:16:11,668 --> 01:16:14,001
Used to be a collector
when I was your age.

1008
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:17,238
Tell me,

1009
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,806
do you take care
of your collection?

1010
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:21,175
Yes.

1011
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:25,046
I have a son.

1012
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:27,648
About your age.

1013
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:32,253
Very messy boy.

1014
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:34,322
He could care less
about stamps.

1015
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:38,292
As for me,

1016
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:40,361
just don't have
the time for them anymore.

1017
01:16:42,332 --> 01:16:44,665
Maybe you should give them
to someone

1018
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:46,300
to take care of them for you.

1019
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:47,835
Yes.

1020
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:49,170
(Whistle blows)

1021
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:58,079
I bet you like sweets,
don't you?

1022
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,219
I made them myself.

1023
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,656
Dark ones are the best.

1024
01:17:10,193 --> 01:17:12,026
Good?

1025
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:13,028
Mmm-hmm.

1026
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:27,942
(Whistle blows)

1027
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,278
General nesterov.

1028
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:48,695
You know,
Moscow is growing suspicious

1029
01:17:48,698 --> 01:17:49,964
of you summoning me
like this.

1030
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:52,233
I demand...

1031
01:17:52,235 --> 01:17:54,935
Bring me all files

1032
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:56,904
involving the death
of children

1033
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:59,907
between the ages
of 9 and 15.

1034
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:03,144
Yes, sir.

1035
01:18:03,146 --> 01:18:04,745
Everything you have.

1036
01:18:04,747 --> 01:18:05,846
Yes.

1037
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,448
And pray
that they're all there.

1038
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:20,428
(Humming)

1039
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:34,475
(Sobbing)

1040
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:43,451
Stop crying. Sniveling shit!

1041
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:45,319
You four-eyed little pig.

1042
01:18:47,457 --> 01:18:48,457
Oh, yes.

1043
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:55,162
A toast, mewling,
sniveling little pig.

1044
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:56,464
(Grunting)

1045
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:02,470
One more time,
to Joseph Stalin!

1046
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:05,039
Father to us all!

1047
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,240
(Breathing heavily)

1048
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,382
(Whimpering)

1049
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:19,487
(Groaning)

1050
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:44,345
(Floor creaking)

1051
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:48,048
There is a situation in rostov.

1052
01:19:49,051 --> 01:19:52,019
What situation?

1053
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:56,857
A boy has been discovered
near the train station.

1054
01:19:56,859 --> 01:20:00,227
They think
he was attacked by a wolf.

1055
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:04,198
(Car approaching)

1056
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:07,569
(Car door closing)

1057
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:11,939
Nesterov:<i> All children</i>

1058
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:14,375
ages 9 to 14.

1059
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:19,280
All found in forests, parks,

1060
01:20:19,282 --> 01:20:21,081
by the train lines.

1061
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:26,253
Naked and either marked
for cuts or with cuts.

1062
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,589
Drowned.

1063
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:33,160
When they bothered
to examine the remains,

1064
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:37,364
every one of them
solved by arrest.

1065
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:40,100
Forty-three in all.

1066
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:42,403
Forty-four.

1067
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,307
My friend's son
was murdered, too.

1068
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:53,347
And there's
a new one in rostov.

1069
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,250
I'm heading there tomorrow.

1070
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:06,193
Rostov.

1071
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:11,465
I have to go to Moscow.

1072
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:15,469
I need you to come with me.

1073
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:22,009
I cannot protect you
if you stay here alone.

1074
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:25,546
I don't need
your protection anymore.

1075
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:31,185
If you come with me
to Moscow,

1076
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:34,188
then I promise you,
you have my word

1077
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:37,992
that I will do anything
and everything that you want.

1078
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:40,427
Whatever it is you ask.

1079
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:43,364
If you want to leave volsk,
if you want to leave me,

1080
01:21:43,366 --> 01:21:45,132
if you want to leave.

1081
01:21:45,134 --> 01:21:47,134
(Baby crying)

1082
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:52,973
You never ever even
have to see me again.

1083
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:54,942
I promise.
You may have my word.

1084
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,513
Nesterov:<i> Tomorrow morning,</i>

1085
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:02,316
<i>you'll have</i>
<i>your identity papers</i>
<i>for the train to Moscow.</i>

1086
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,460
<i>I've granted you
a walking holiday.</i>

1087
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:10,257
<i>That'll explain
your absence from here.</i>

1088
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,653
(Whistle blowing)

1089
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:41,221
(Man speaking on pa)

1090
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:58,072
Alexei: What are you
doing here, Leo?

1091
01:22:58,074 --> 01:22:59,540
You're not
supposed to be here.

1092
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:01,575
Alexei, it's about your son.
He was murdered.

1093
01:23:01,577 --> 01:23:03,410
You've come
to the wrong address.

1094
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:05,446
No boy was murdered here.
No, no, no.

1095
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:08,482
I've made a mistake.
It's not true. It's not true.

1096
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,351
I was wrong.

1097
01:23:10,353 --> 01:23:11,552
I was wrong,
you were right.

1098
01:23:11,554 --> 01:23:13,554
I have the papers here.

1099
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:17,458
His death certificate says
much more than we know of.

1100
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:18,492
Raisa: Look.

1101
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,394
From Moscow train station

1102
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:23,097
all the way down
the train tracks to rostov.

1103
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:24,099
It's very serious.

1104
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,768
And if you find this man, Leo,

1105
01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:31,038
what will you do?

1106
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,173
I bring him to justice.

1107
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:34,308
You will bring him to justice?

1108
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:35,409
<i>Da.</i>

1109
01:23:38,047 --> 01:23:42,016
You're nobody anymore, Leo.
You're nobody.

1110
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:44,084
How you gonna
bring him to justice?

1111
01:23:44,086 --> 01:23:45,285
Just the two of you?

1112
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:48,022
Is this a joke?

1113
01:23:50,059 --> 01:23:52,292
Leo, if you really wanna help,

1114
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:55,396
you find this man
and you cut his head off!

1115
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:56,797
Can you do that?

1116
01:24:02,304 --> 01:24:03,537
Leo: Yes.

1117
01:24:05,775 --> 01:24:08,308
For you, alexei,
I will do this.

1118
01:24:10,746 --> 01:24:12,346
But if I do that,

1119
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:15,449
then nobody will ever know.

1120
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:18,385
Please.

1121
01:24:20,256 --> 01:24:23,357
Nina, we need
to see the witness.

1122
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:29,830
How can I help?
I don't know anything.

1123
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:33,834
Listen, galina,

1124
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:37,404
the man that killed my son,

1125
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,473
he's still out there,

1126
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:41,642
killing other children,
do you understand?

1127
01:24:41,644 --> 01:24:44,645
Nobody, nobody can get
into any trouble

1128
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:46,480
by simply describing

1129
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:49,149
what a worker looked like
on his way to work.

1130
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:51,552
Do you understand?
It's not possible.

1131
01:24:51,554 --> 01:24:54,354
He's here, talking to you.
I'm here.

1132
01:24:54,356 --> 01:24:56,690
I guarantee you I am
no threat. You have my word.

1133
01:24:56,692 --> 01:24:59,526
Look at me. I have no uniform.

1134
01:24:59,528 --> 01:25:03,130
I promise you, you are safe
to speak to me, so please.

1135
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:09,470
It was dark.

1136
01:25:10,473 --> 01:25:11,805
Yes?

1137
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:12,807
Please.
Man: Galina!

1138
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:15,509
What's going on?

1139
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:17,644
Galina!
Who are you talking to?

1140
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:20,414
Please, whisper to me.
What did he look like?

1141
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:21,882
We are just
making conversation.

1142
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:23,550
There is no problem here.
Please.

1143
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:25,385
Get out of my house!

1144
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:27,354
Please, calm down.
Take it easy.

1145
01:25:27,356 --> 01:25:29,523
Easy? You want easy?

1146
01:25:29,525 --> 01:25:30,724
You want easy?
Raisa, I have to go.

1147
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:32,659
Please, you must
remember something.

1148
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:34,361
Man 2: Get out!

1149
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:35,596
(Clamoring)

1150
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:00,320
Are you on your own?

1151
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:05,159
Does your mother
know where you are?

1152
01:26:06,762 --> 01:26:07,794
(Whistle blows)

1153
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:11,431
Is that heavy?

1154
01:26:13,469 --> 01:26:14,935
It's heavier than it looks.

1155
01:26:15,938 --> 01:26:17,304
I could carry it.

1156
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:22,509
All right then. Up you get.

1157
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:27,514
Let's see
what you're made of.

1158
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:34,956
Hello!

1159
01:26:37,493 --> 01:26:40,794
Son, you're getting
far too heavy for me to carry.

1160
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:41,929
(Breathing heavily)

1161
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:43,463
Hi.
Vlad: Hello, sweetheart.

1162
01:26:43,465 --> 01:26:45,332
What did I tell you?

1163
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:46,667
I wanted to meet daddy.

1164
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:50,437
What are you worried about?
He's with me.

1165
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,440
Eh?

1166
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:55,242
Come on.

1167
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:02,516
Man: In the war,

1168
01:27:02,518 --> 01:27:05,452
Hitler left hidden
revenge squads

1169
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:08,522
all the way back to the rhine.

1170
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:10,757
I saw what those German
soldiers were capable of.

1171
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,694
Is there anything else?

1172
01:27:14,697 --> 01:27:17,598
He fed them special drugs

1173
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:23,403
to make them addicted
to the blood of children.

1174
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:26,907
Now it's all coming to a head.

1175
01:27:28,811 --> 01:27:31,678
Nine children around here

1176
01:27:35,284 --> 01:27:37,034
(sniffling)

1177
01:27:37,035 --> 01:27:38,785
Found like artur
in the past two years.

1178
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,693
Nine?

1179
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:49,029
Man: That bloody monster
is still killing us.

1180
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:52,699
Even from his grave.

1181
01:28:01,877 --> 01:28:03,010
(Woman sobbing)

1182
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:06,813
Sorry for your loss.

1183
01:28:10,886 --> 01:28:12,719
I'm sorry for your loss.

1184
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:16,790
Man on pa: <i>All citizens
are required</i>

1185
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,859
<i>to show proper identification.</i>

1186
01:28:18,861 --> 01:28:22,863
<i>The station is temporarily
under mgb jurisdiction.</i>

1187
01:28:25,367 --> 01:28:29,903
<i>All citizens are required to
show proper identification.</i>

1188
01:28:29,905 --> 01:28:34,074
<i>The station is temporarily
under mgb jurisdiction.</i>

1189
01:28:34,076 --> 01:28:36,410
I think it's not good.
It's not good.

1190
01:28:36,412 --> 01:28:38,945
We can't go this way.
We have to find another way.

1191
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:41,081
I think I know someone
who can help us.

1192
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:54,027
I don't like this.
I don't like him.
I don't trust him.

1193
01:28:55,464 --> 01:28:56,730
But I do.

1194
01:29:01,737 --> 01:29:02,936
(Door buzzer ringing)

1195
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:22,656
We all thought
you'd been arrested.

1196
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:23,658
Or worse.

1197
01:29:25,828 --> 01:29:28,095
Leo refused to denounce me.

1198
01:29:29,765 --> 01:29:31,365
Why did you refuse?

1199
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:36,371
She's my wife.

1200
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,840
You traveled all the way
back to Moscow

1201
01:29:39,842 --> 01:29:42,142
at, I assume,
great personal risk.

1202
01:29:43,445 --> 01:29:44,445
Mmm-hmm.

1203
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:46,880
Why?

1204
01:29:50,652 --> 01:29:53,620
Leo: You see, (Clears throat)
Each of these children

1205
01:29:53,622 --> 01:29:55,122
have been murdered

1206
01:29:55,124 --> 01:29:57,824
over the past
several years and

1207
01:29:59,128 --> 01:30:01,628
each of these individual cases

1208
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:05,432
has been solved
by the state.

1209
01:30:05,434 --> 01:30:08,101
The perpetrators dealt with.

1210
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:12,873
But if you look very closely
and examine the children,

1211
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:16,176
they have all been killed
in a similar manner.

1212
01:30:17,179 --> 01:30:18,945
So what you're saying is

1213
01:30:18,947 --> 01:30:21,481
somebody is responsible
for this?

1214
01:30:21,483 --> 01:30:22,783
Leo: Absolutely.

1215
01:30:22,785 --> 01:30:25,485
And this somebody
is still out there.

1216
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:26,953
Raisa: Yes.

1217
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:28,922
A murderer.

1218
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:30,791
You're saying
there's a murderer?

1219
01:30:30,793 --> 01:30:32,492
Without doubt.

1220
01:30:32,494 --> 01:30:35,195
You do realize there are
no murderers in paradise?

1221
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,834
So you two are working
together now? As what?

1222
01:30:42,204 --> 01:30:44,838
Outraged citizens?

1223
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,140
Raisa: Sort of. Yes.

1224
01:30:47,142 --> 01:30:50,610
Going to capture
this troll by yourselves?

1225
01:30:52,848 --> 01:30:55,048
Somebody has to.

1226
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:58,752
Ivan, look at these pictures.
Do you see?

1227
01:30:58,754 --> 01:31:02,522
These children.
Look. This is real.

1228
01:31:02,524 --> 01:31:04,458
Look at these names,
those documents.

1229
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,793
The documents. Let's carefully
examine the documents.

1230
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,495
Raisa: Yes.
Ivan: With all these names.

1231
01:31:08,497 --> 01:31:09,737
All these...
All these children.

1232
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:11,832
Raisa: Ivan!

1233
01:31:11,834 --> 01:31:12,866
Who is in charge
of these wrongdoings?

1234
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:14,568
Raisa: Ivan!

1235
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:15,635
(Ivan sighing)

1236
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:18,605
All right.

1237
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:24,878
You are making me nervous.

1238
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:27,547
Close the curtains.

1239
01:31:27,549 --> 01:31:28,582
All right.

1240
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,220
Thank you.

1241
01:31:46,068 --> 01:31:47,234
Look.

1242
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:52,172
I know someone who,
if he's willing,

1243
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:55,709
can get you out of the city.

1244
01:31:55,711 --> 01:31:57,944
Raisa: Thank you. Thank you.

1245
01:31:59,915 --> 01:32:01,648
Thank you, Ivanov.

1246
01:32:02,918 --> 01:32:04,084
(Clattering)

1247
01:32:09,591 --> 01:32:10,591
You have telephone?

1248
01:32:12,961 --> 01:32:16,096
Ivan: They forgot to remove it
when the last tenant died.

1249
01:32:16,098 --> 01:32:19,966
I keep it hidden.
Disconnected.

1250
01:32:19,968 --> 01:32:21,635
Save for emergencies.

1251
01:32:30,546 --> 01:32:31,945
Leo: Do you have
many emergencies?

1252
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:36,049
Ivan: I have many problems.

1253
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:38,985
(Dialing)

1254
01:32:38,987 --> 01:32:39,987
Here we go.

1255
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:53,233
Professor zalman?

1256
01:32:55,137 --> 01:32:57,804
Are you free at the moment?

1257
01:32:57,806 --> 01:32:59,239
Could he come
to the apartment?

1258
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:00,740
(Whispering) I don't know
why he has this.

1259
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:03,009
There was an incident
in school. I don't know.

1260
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:04,678
He shouldn't have this.

1261
01:33:06,315 --> 01:33:08,949
Ivan: Yes, immediately,
if possible.

1262
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:10,750
I'm afraid time is
of the essence.

1263
01:33:15,123 --> 01:33:16,690
Thank you, professor.

1264
01:33:17,693 --> 01:33:18,825
Hello? Professor?

1265
01:33:23,966 --> 01:33:25,298
Raisa: Leo! Leo, wait!

1266
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,380
I don't know why he has it.

1267
01:33:29,037 --> 01:33:30,103
Leo, wait.

1268
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:32,238
(Grunting)

1269
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:39,379
Leo, please.

1270
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:43,283
Leo, please, stop this!

1271
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,620
Traitorous scum.

1272
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:49,789
We should have
killed you both.

1273
01:33:52,027 --> 01:33:53,226
(Choking)

1274
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:09,909
(Breathing heavily)

1275
01:34:11,013 --> 01:34:12,045
(Exhales)

1276
01:34:13,048 --> 01:34:14,247
(Panting)

1277
01:34:21,923 --> 01:34:23,289
(Man speaking on pa)

1278
01:34:29,297 --> 01:34:31,898
I'm sorry.
I truly thought...

1279
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:34,768
Thought what? That he wasn't
fishing with his books?

1280
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:37,671
That he wasn't mgb?
Don't be sorry.

1281
01:34:37,673 --> 01:34:40,033
He couldn't draw you in if he
wasn't doing his job properly.

1282
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:43,678
Listen...

1283
01:34:47,082 --> 01:34:48,948
I made you a promise.

1284
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,020
Now you don't
have to stay with me.

1285
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:56,389
Do you understand?

1286
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:01,861
I'm coming with you.

1287
01:35:50,312 --> 01:35:51,511
What?

1288
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:54,414
That guy.

1289
01:35:55,817 --> 01:35:56,817
He can't read.

1290
01:36:05,861 --> 01:36:08,027
(Speaking indistinctly)

1291
01:36:13,034 --> 01:36:14,100
Thank you, sir.

1292
01:36:53,542 --> 01:36:55,441
Did you find your witness?

1293
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:01,447
Moscow was a complete wash.

1294
01:37:02,918 --> 01:37:04,551
Well, forget Moscow.

1295
01:37:05,854 --> 01:37:07,987
We go towards rostov.

1296
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:13,026
It's the heart of this,
I'm sure.

1297
01:37:13,028 --> 01:37:15,495
All kill routes
passing through.

1298
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:17,130
Plus twice
the number of children

1299
01:37:17,132 --> 01:37:19,399
murdered there
than anywhere else.

1300
01:37:21,269 --> 01:37:23,336
And I believe
he works and kills

1301
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,839
<i>along the two train lines.</i>

1302
01:37:25,841 --> 01:37:28,341
What is the connection
between volsk and rostov?

1303
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,376
There are no murders
east of here.

1304
01:37:30,378 --> 01:37:32,111
This may be his end point.

1305
01:37:32,113 --> 01:37:34,247
Mmm, but what is here for him?

1306
01:37:35,884 --> 01:37:37,150
The gaz factory?

1307
01:37:38,153 --> 01:37:39,352
Gaz factory.

1308
01:37:40,622 --> 01:37:42,956
And what's in rostov
for the factory?

1309
01:37:42,958 --> 01:37:45,225
The rostov tractor factory.

1310
01:37:46,494 --> 01:37:48,895
So it's likely he works there.

1311
01:37:48,897 --> 01:37:52,232
We find his job
and we find him.

1312
01:38:00,342 --> 01:38:01,342
(Knocking)

1313
01:38:08,316 --> 01:38:09,382
Hello, Leo.

1314
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:15,221
You miss me?

1315
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:17,657
Some people
just don't learn, I guess.

1316
01:38:17,659 --> 01:38:19,525
I'd like a word in private.

1317
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,283
Nesterov: Inessa.

1318
01:38:44,953 --> 01:38:46,219
(Whistle blows)

1319
01:38:46,221 --> 01:38:47,453
(Groaning)

1320
01:38:54,596 --> 01:38:59,065
I understand your desire
to stay loyal to him.

1321
01:39:01,236 --> 01:39:02,602
My point being,
it will be better

1322
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:05,338
if you told me
everything immediately.

1323
01:39:07,676 --> 01:39:09,609
Would it make any difference?

1324
01:39:11,212 --> 01:39:12,278
Of course.

1325
01:39:17,252 --> 01:39:18,985
You're a monster.

1326
01:39:23,725 --> 01:39:25,765
Raisa, I hope you understand
you leave me no choice.

1327
01:39:37,605 --> 01:39:40,440
Leo, what did they do to you?

1328
01:39:40,442 --> 01:39:41,541
Leo! Please, Leo.

1329
01:39:42,544 --> 01:39:43,676
(Whistle blows)

1330
01:40:03,098 --> 01:40:04,497
(Whistle blows)

1331
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,183
(People coughing)

1332
01:40:39,134 --> 01:40:40,533
(Guard speaking indistinctly)

1333
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:44,270
Leo.

1334
01:40:48,343 --> 01:40:50,743
Leo. Leo, please.

1335
01:40:52,814 --> 01:40:55,381
Leo! Listen to me.
You have to wake up.

1336
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:58,785
Leo! Leo, please! Leo! Leo!

1337
01:41:00,422 --> 01:41:01,721
(Clamoring)

1338
01:41:03,658 --> 01:41:04,724
(Grunting)

1339
01:41:09,497 --> 01:41:10,497
Raisa: Leo!

1340
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:22,642
(Groans)

1341
01:41:25,847 --> 01:41:26,847
(Groaning)

1342
01:41:28,283 --> 01:41:29,283
(Groans)

1343
01:41:38,526 --> 01:41:40,359
(Groans)

1344
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:41,427
Leo!

1345
01:41:43,498 --> 01:41:45,098
(Grunting)

1346
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:53,172
(Blade swishing)

1347
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:13,359
(Both panting)

1348
01:42:34,849 --> 01:42:35,882
Raisa: Are you all right?

1349
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,620
We need to get off this train.

1350
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:52,832
It was a guard.

1351
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:54,867
That man behind the door.
He gave them knife.

1352
01:43:01,609 --> 01:43:02,909
(Banging)

1353
01:43:05,914 --> 01:43:07,313
(Groaning)

1354
01:43:19,794 --> 01:43:20,874
We must get off this train.

1355
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,365
Jump, raisa, now! Jump!

1356
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:29,802
Go.

1357
01:43:29,804 --> 01:43:31,504
(Groaning)

1358
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:36,842
(Grunting)

1359
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:43,983
(Whistle blows)

1360
01:43:55,897 --> 01:43:57,897
(Clamoring)

1361
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:04,003
(Yelling in Russian)

1362
01:44:06,674 --> 01:44:08,474
(Officers shouting)

1363
01:44:15,850 --> 01:44:17,750
Vasili:<i> It's impossible.</i>

1364
01:44:17,752 --> 01:44:20,253
The arrangements
were made last minute.

1365
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:22,455
There's no paper trail.
No one able to preplan.

1366
01:44:22,457 --> 01:44:23,956
No one even knew
which transport they were on.

1367
01:44:23,958 --> 01:44:26,559
You did.
Didn't you?

1368
01:44:28,663 --> 01:44:30,563
Listen to me, you.

1369
01:44:30,565 --> 01:44:32,665
I promise you something.

1370
01:44:32,667 --> 01:44:34,767
If my time is up,
so is yours.

1371
01:44:38,539 --> 01:44:40,539
You wanted his desk?

1372
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:42,101
Then take the weight
that comes with it.

1373
01:44:51,886 --> 01:44:52,886
Alexei,

1374
01:44:54,055 --> 01:44:57,757
tell me why Leo
was arrested.

1375
01:44:57,759 --> 01:44:59,892
See, the bosses believe that
he was working for the west,

1376
01:44:59,894 --> 01:45:02,828
but I believe
he was working on this.

1377
01:45:04,732 --> 01:45:07,300
Series of child murders,
you see?

1378
01:45:09,437 --> 01:45:11,037
Your son,
may he rest in peace,

1379
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:13,472
he was murdered, yes?

1380
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:16,309
No. He was killed
in an accident.

1381
01:45:18,313 --> 01:45:20,980
But at first you believed
he was murdered, right?

1382
01:45:24,952 --> 01:45:26,018
Sit down.

1383
01:45:31,326 --> 01:45:33,826
At first, yes, I did.

1384
01:45:35,863 --> 01:45:38,831
But, you see, I was upset.

1385
01:45:40,635 --> 01:45:43,469
So when
he came back to Moscow,

1386
01:45:43,471 --> 01:45:45,638
it wasn't your son's murder
he was interested in?

1387
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:46,739
Well...

1388
01:45:49,377 --> 01:45:50,843
I don't...

1389
01:45:50,845 --> 01:45:52,345
All I'm saying is that

1390
01:45:55,717 --> 01:46:00,720
if my son's death was Leo's
reason to return to Moscow,

1391
01:46:00,722 --> 01:46:02,488
he never contacted me.

1392
01:46:07,128 --> 01:46:09,128
Is that how little
you think of me?

1393
01:46:11,532 --> 01:46:13,432
I don't think
anything of you.

1394
01:46:17,004 --> 01:46:18,637
(Bangs desk)

1395
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,539
You think you can save Leo?

1396
01:46:22,076 --> 01:46:25,745
You can't save Leo, alexei.
You know that, right?

1397
01:46:27,415 --> 01:46:29,115
But you can still
save your family.

1398
01:46:40,962 --> 01:46:43,129
My family survives, vasili.

1399
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:47,032
If I may ask you,

1400
01:46:50,872 --> 01:46:52,872
where exactly did they escape?

1401
01:46:55,143 --> 01:46:56,175
Come here.

1402
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:01,680
It's right here.

1403
01:47:01,682 --> 01:47:03,616
Near Vladimir.

1404
01:47:06,187 --> 01:47:07,687
Well,

1405
01:47:07,688 --> 01:47:09,188
seems that
the earliest incidents

1406
01:47:09,190 --> 01:47:12,191
were all around this area.

1407
01:47:12,193 --> 01:47:15,728
<i>The highest concentration
around rostov-on-don.</i>

1408
01:47:17,498 --> 01:47:19,665
<i>My guess is that this man,</i>

1409
01:47:20,868 --> 01:47:21,934
<i>this child murderer,</i>

1410
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:24,804
<i>he lives there.</i>

1411
01:47:24,806 --> 01:47:27,506
<i>If I was Leo,
I would be heading to rostov.</i>

1412
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:31,210
Is that all?

1413
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:35,981
Vasili: That's all.

1414
01:47:47,728 --> 01:47:48,894
(Groaning)

1415
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:05,044
Man: Rostov factory.

1416
01:48:05,046 --> 01:48:06,645
Raisa: Leo, we are here.

1417
01:48:06,647 --> 01:48:07,647
(Leo grunts)

1418
01:48:18,926 --> 01:48:19,926
Leo: Stay with me.

1419
01:48:28,803 --> 01:48:33,138
I'll have to find a way
into the records office.

1420
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:34,507
If I'm not back
in half an hour...

1421
01:48:34,509 --> 01:48:35,774
You will be.

1422
01:48:35,776 --> 01:48:36,909
Leo: Wait here.

1423
01:48:57,198 --> 01:48:59,164
(Indistinct announcements on pa)

1424
01:49:22,023 --> 01:49:23,188
Where are you going?

1425
01:49:31,065 --> 01:49:33,065
You! Turn around.
Put your hands
against the wall.

1426
01:49:34,569 --> 01:49:37,303
Hands on the fucking wall.
Don't move.

1427
01:49:46,047 --> 01:49:47,047
What's your name?

1428
01:49:48,215 --> 01:49:50,049
Sergei.

1429
01:49:50,051 --> 01:49:52,618
Okay, Sergei,
listen to me.

1430
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:55,955
You do exactly as I say.<i> Da?</i>
<i>Exactly as I say.</i>

1431
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:06,098
Just relax.

1432
01:50:11,606 --> 01:50:13,939
Slow down.

1433
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:15,741
What do you sell here
in your factory?

1434
01:50:15,743 --> 01:50:17,142
What do you make?

1435
01:50:17,144 --> 01:50:18,143
Sergei: The tractor parts.

1436
01:50:18,145 --> 01:50:19,345
Leo: Tractor parts?

1437
01:50:19,347 --> 01:50:20,779
Yes.

1438
01:50:20,781 --> 01:50:22,014
Leo: Up your stairs.

1439
01:50:26,921 --> 01:50:28,153
Open your door.

1440
01:50:31,058 --> 01:50:32,058
Get inside.

1441
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:35,661
Give me your keys.

1442
01:50:35,663 --> 01:50:37,463
Sit down. Put your hands
where I can see them.

1443
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:40,933
What do you want?

1444
01:50:40,935 --> 01:50:42,768
I want you to sit down.

1445
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:44,330
And put your hands
where I can see them.

1446
01:50:46,073 --> 01:50:50,009
Sergei, listen very carefully.

1447
01:50:50,011 --> 01:50:53,379
I have here some documents.

1448
01:50:55,116 --> 01:50:57,149
And on these documents

1449
01:50:57,151 --> 01:50:59,818
there are areas

1450
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:03,088
and there are dates
in these columns. You see?

1451
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:05,758
I need you to find me
the controller

1452
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:08,827
who has visited
these areas in this column,

1453
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:11,864
in or on or around these dates
here in this column.

1454
01:51:11,866 --> 01:51:13,766
Do you understand?
I understand.

1455
01:51:13,768 --> 01:51:14,933
I need you to find him now.

1456
01:51:15,936 --> 01:51:18,003
Okay now. May I?

1457
01:51:19,073 --> 01:51:20,205
Of course.

1458
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:27,146
So...

1459
01:51:34,221 --> 01:51:35,320
(Muttering) That's not it.

1460
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:46,965
Yes, Major kuzmin.

1461
01:51:46,967 --> 01:51:48,300
<i>So where are you with this?</i>

1462
01:51:48,302 --> 01:51:51,070
<i>And don't fill
my ear with shit.</i>

1463
01:51:51,072 --> 01:51:54,440
Nothing. They're idiots here.
I'm surrounded by idiots.

1464
01:51:54,442 --> 01:51:57,710
<i>I'm tired
of your excuses, vasili.</i>

1465
01:51:57,712 --> 01:51:59,411
<i>Just find them,
or it's both our necks.</i>

1466
01:52:03,851 --> 01:52:05,417
Sergei: Fifty-five.

1467
01:52:08,923 --> 01:52:10,222
Fifty-two.

1468
01:52:10,224 --> 01:52:12,758
Yes, I think I got it.

1469
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,827
This one.
Are you sure?

1470
01:52:14,829 --> 01:52:17,329
I hope. I am sure.

1471
01:52:17,331 --> 01:52:20,332
Sit down. Put your hands
where I can see them.

1472
01:52:49,497 --> 01:52:51,163
(Inaudible)

1473
01:53:37,044 --> 01:53:38,277
(Car starting)

1474
01:53:42,249 --> 01:53:43,448
(Tires screeching)

1475
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:47,386
Raisa.

1476
01:53:58,165 --> 01:53:59,498
Sir.

1477
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,333
The tractor factory.
A man was attacked

1478
01:54:01,335 --> 01:54:02,495
in the administration office.

1479
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:05,337
What happened?

1480
01:54:05,339 --> 01:54:09,041
It's just some
employment files were stolen.

1481
01:54:13,247 --> 01:54:14,513
They're here.

1482
01:54:24,458 --> 01:54:26,258
Raisa: That's his car.

1483
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,426
He knows.

1484
01:54:32,433 --> 01:54:34,032
Please, be careful.

1485
01:54:57,925 --> 01:54:59,291
(Switches engine off)

1486
01:54:59,293 --> 01:55:01,159
Leo.

1487
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:02,494
There's somebody up there.

1488
01:55:03,931 --> 01:55:05,397
(Footsteps rustling)

1489
01:55:32,559 --> 01:55:33,959
Stay here.

1490
01:55:33,961 --> 01:55:35,160
Leo, be careful.

1491
01:55:38,532 --> 01:55:39,932
(Panting)

1492
01:55:44,338 --> 01:55:46,004
(Groaning)

1493
01:56:33,354 --> 01:56:34,453
You have come.

1494
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:38,023
Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

1495
01:56:40,427 --> 01:56:42,160
These woods and banks.

1496
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:45,630
Scrounging for grub.

1497
01:56:47,201 --> 01:56:48,400
Rat.

1498
01:56:50,771 --> 01:56:52,537
Cat if we were lucky.

1499
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:55,140
Always so hungry.

1500
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:58,343
Some of us
even ate each other.

1501
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:00,779
The weaker ones.

1502
01:57:03,584 --> 01:57:05,550
I know who you are, demidov.

1503
01:57:08,422 --> 01:57:11,456
I know you were
in an orphanage,
just like me.

1504
01:57:13,093 --> 01:57:15,394
Who in the whole country
does not know that?

1505
01:57:18,332 --> 01:57:20,665
How the war redeemed you.

1506
01:57:22,236 --> 01:57:23,668
Made you into a hero.

1507
01:57:25,506 --> 01:57:27,472
Some of us were not so lucky.

1508
01:57:28,642 --> 01:57:30,442
I was a surgeon in the army.

1509
01:57:31,445 --> 01:57:32,445
But no matter.

1510
01:57:33,447 --> 01:57:34,813
At the end of the day,

1511
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:37,449
hero,

1512
01:57:38,452 --> 01:57:39,651
monster...

1513
01:57:42,656 --> 01:57:44,756
We are both killers,
you and I.

1514
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:48,293
Tell me,

1515
01:57:50,164 --> 01:57:52,564
are there no children
on your conscience, Leo?

1516
01:57:56,136 --> 01:57:59,604
You knew what you were doing
and you chose to do it.

1517
01:58:01,708 --> 01:58:03,208
But me,

1518
01:58:06,246 --> 01:58:08,613
I can't help it.

1519
01:58:08,615 --> 01:58:09,848
(Sobbing) I can't.

1520
01:58:12,086 --> 01:58:13,086
(Gunshot)

1521
01:58:16,156 --> 01:58:17,222
Vasili: Drop the gun, Leo.

1522
01:58:18,225 --> 01:58:19,825
Drop it.

1523
01:58:19,827 --> 01:58:21,660
(Thuds)

1524
01:58:21,662 --> 01:58:23,161
Get up here.

1525
01:58:23,163 --> 01:58:24,163
(Grunts)

1526
01:58:33,774 --> 01:58:35,107
Get down.

1527
01:58:37,511 --> 01:58:38,710
(Whimpering)

1528
01:58:41,181 --> 01:58:43,415
You know,
this reminds me of that...

1529
01:58:44,651 --> 01:58:46,718
Of that farmer, okun.

1530
01:58:47,821 --> 01:58:49,488
Was he innocent, Leo?

1531
01:58:51,158 --> 01:58:52,524
Are you innocent?

1532
01:58:55,129 --> 01:58:56,261
Are you?

1533
01:58:57,264 --> 01:58:58,730
Raisa: Please...

1534
01:58:58,732 --> 01:58:59,732
(Gun cocking)

1535
01:59:01,235 --> 01:59:03,235
Vasili: My big brother.

1536
01:59:03,237 --> 01:59:05,804
Always telling me
what's right and wrong.

1537
01:59:06,807 --> 01:59:08,340
I never wanted this, Leo.

1538
01:59:08,342 --> 01:59:09,708
Please.

1539
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:10,842
Never.
Please.

1540
01:59:13,413 --> 01:59:15,714
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.

1541
01:59:23,423 --> 01:59:24,423
(Groaning)

1542
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:28,827
Vasili!

1543
01:59:31,431 --> 01:59:32,464
(Grunting)

1544
01:59:51,351 --> 01:59:52,951
Vasili: Son of a bitch!

1545
02:00:03,597 --> 02:00:04,597
Leo!

1546
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:06,765
(Grunting)

1547
02:00:15,909 --> 02:00:18,310
Vasili: Fucking bitch!

1548
02:00:19,479 --> 02:00:20,479
Raisa: Leo!

1549
02:00:21,481 --> 02:00:22,881
Leo!

1550
02:00:22,883 --> 02:00:23,949
(Screaming)

1551
02:00:32,292 --> 02:00:33,358
Vasili!

1552
02:00:35,762 --> 02:00:36,962
(Thunder rumbling)

1553
02:00:52,779 --> 02:00:54,312
(Panting)

1554
02:01:10,797 --> 02:01:12,497
(Both grunting)

1555
02:01:15,669 --> 02:01:16,968
God.

1556
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:35,420
(Officers shouting)

1557
02:01:46,767 --> 02:01:48,533
Halt!

1558
02:01:48,535 --> 02:01:50,468
Leo: Officer,

1559
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:51,470
this man...

1560
02:01:52,472 --> 02:01:54,939
This man is criminal.

1561
02:01:54,941 --> 02:01:57,842
Your superior officer,

1562
02:01:57,844 --> 02:02:02,380
he died whilst trying
to apprehend him. This man...

1563
02:02:02,382 --> 02:02:04,015
This man is a hero.

1564
02:02:05,652 --> 02:02:07,018
This officer is hero!

1565
02:02:14,328 --> 02:02:15,860
(Thunder rumbling)

1566
02:02:30,811 --> 02:02:34,479
Grachev: <i>Congratulations
on your reinstatement.</i>

1567
02:02:34,481 --> 02:02:36,614
<i>Major kuzmin was
arrested yesterday, you know.</i>

1568
02:02:37,617 --> 02:02:38,783
Yes, I heard.

1569
02:02:38,785 --> 02:02:40,952
He was
an old guard appointee.

1570
02:02:42,489 --> 02:02:44,556
We live in new times,
demidov.

1571
02:02:44,558 --> 02:02:45,690
Yes, I have heard.

1572
02:02:45,692 --> 02:02:46,758
Mmm-hmm.

1573
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:48,093
(Door closes)

1574
02:02:50,497 --> 02:02:54,132
I've been authorized to
offer you a promotion.

1575
02:02:54,134 --> 02:02:56,468
In the new
state security organization.

1576
02:02:58,605 --> 02:03:00,572
And a clear path
to a political role,

1577
02:03:00,574 --> 02:03:01,806
should you want it.

1578
02:03:04,644 --> 02:03:06,378
Please.

1579
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:08,680
No, please.
I am good standing.
Feels fine.

1580
02:03:14,521 --> 02:03:16,121
Vlad malevich.

1581
02:03:18,492 --> 02:03:21,426
<i>Pravda</i> labeled him
"the werewolf of rostov."

1582
02:03:21,428 --> 02:03:22,627
Werewolf?

1583
02:03:22,629 --> 02:03:23,629
Mmm.

1584
02:03:25,098 --> 02:03:26,664
We discovered he spent

1585
02:03:26,666 --> 02:03:30,001
two years in a German camp
during the war.

1586
02:03:30,003 --> 02:03:31,603
Now anybody who survives

1587
02:03:31,605 --> 02:03:35,673
two years in that situation
must have been turned.

1588
02:03:35,675 --> 02:03:38,476
Obviously, we repatriated
a Nazi agent.

1589
02:03:39,613 --> 02:03:40,879
Wouldn't you agree?

1590
02:03:42,616 --> 02:03:45,650
It is possible.

1591
02:03:45,652 --> 02:03:49,120
But was he not brought up
in Russian orphanage, no?

1592
02:03:49,122 --> 02:03:51,089
We believe he was trained

1593
02:03:51,091 --> 02:03:53,158
to take revenge on us
for their defeat.

1594
02:03:54,861 --> 02:03:56,795
They wanted
the Russian people to believe

1595
02:03:56,797 --> 02:04:00,498
that our society
could produce such a monster.

1596
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:03,835
Whereas, obviously, he was
corrupted and transformed

1597
02:04:03,837 --> 02:04:05,703
by his time in the west.

1598
02:04:07,974 --> 02:04:10,508
Was that not
your thinking, demidov?

1599
02:04:13,647 --> 02:04:15,180
It is very difficult.

1600
02:04:15,182 --> 02:04:16,681
Difficult?
Why difficult?

1601
02:04:16,683 --> 02:04:19,484
No, it's very difficult
to ascertain exactly

1602
02:04:21,221 --> 02:04:25,056
which society
is responsible for causing

1603
02:04:25,058 --> 02:04:27,192
vlad malevich
to become what he was.

1604
02:04:28,195 --> 02:04:29,694
Bullshit.

1605
02:04:31,698 --> 02:04:33,998
Sir, if I may,
I wish to refuse your offer

1606
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,700
and make a request of my own.

1607
02:04:36,703 --> 02:04:37,902
Really?

1608
02:04:39,706 --> 02:04:41,506
Go on.

1609
02:04:41,508 --> 02:04:42,974
I want to create
and take charge

1610
02:04:42,976 --> 02:04:45,076
of Moscow homicide department.

1611
02:04:47,147 --> 02:04:50,148
And what need is there
of such a department?

1612
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:51,616
As you said,

1613
02:04:53,687 --> 02:04:56,888
murder has been used before
to tear us down from within.

1614
02:04:58,158 --> 02:05:00,191
And vlad malevich?

1615
02:05:02,062 --> 02:05:03,127
(Sighs)

1616
02:05:04,231 --> 02:05:07,165
Vlad malevich, I would say

1617
02:05:07,167 --> 02:05:09,667
returned home
with a poisoned foreign heart.

1618
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:11,936
Without doubt. Absolutely.

1619
02:05:16,977 --> 02:05:18,109
Good.

1620
02:05:19,613 --> 02:05:22,614
Just one thing
I would like to ask you.

1621
02:05:22,616 --> 02:05:25,183
General nesterov.

1622
02:05:25,185 --> 02:05:28,219
I would also like him
to work for this department.

1623
02:05:28,221 --> 02:05:30,054
I believe
that his skills and ability

1624
02:05:30,056 --> 02:05:31,623
in matters of this kind

1625
02:05:32,626 --> 02:05:33,992
are exemplary.

1626
02:06:03,924 --> 02:06:05,189
(Door closes)

1627
02:06:13,266 --> 02:06:17,035
I found them.
Would you like to see them?

1628
02:06:17,037 --> 02:06:18,703
Raisa: Yes, please.

1629
02:06:18,705 --> 02:06:20,672
They are in the waiting room.
This way, please.

1630
02:06:21,775 --> 02:06:23,308
Please.
Mmm.<i> Da.</i>

1631
02:06:29,916 --> 02:06:30,916
Please.

1632
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:54,205
Leo: Hello.

1633
02:06:57,077 --> 02:06:59,110
This is my wife raisa.

1634
02:06:59,112 --> 02:07:01,646
She's a... she's a teacher.

1635
02:07:03,817 --> 02:07:05,316
She teaches children. Eh?

1636
02:07:06,319 --> 02:07:07,385
Hello.

1637
02:07:09,289 --> 02:07:11,990
Elena, Tamara.

1638
02:07:11,992 --> 02:07:15,226
Why don't we all sit down?
It's much nicer sitting down.

1639
02:07:17,697 --> 02:07:18,697
<i>Da.</i>

1640
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:25,336
Raisa: We would like,
if you want,

1641
02:07:26,373 --> 02:07:29,040
to give you a home. Our home.

1642
02:07:30,043 --> 02:07:31,043
Leo: Yes.

1643
02:07:32,812 --> 02:07:34,779
You came to our farm.

1644
02:07:39,019 --> 02:07:40,251
I mean, yes.

1645
02:07:41,287 --> 02:07:42,954
Yes, I did. I did.

1646
02:07:42,956 --> 02:07:44,188
But, um...

1647
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:47,660
Um...

1648
02:07:50,397 --> 02:07:53,364
We wanna look after you.
Take care of you.

1649
02:07:55,201 --> 02:07:56,901
As my husband said,

1650
02:07:56,903 --> 02:08:00,238
I can teach you
how to read, write.

1651
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:02,040
We can go to parks.

1652
02:08:02,042 --> 02:08:03,274
We have friends. There are
a lot of things we can do.

1653
02:08:03,276 --> 02:08:07,078
I can't bring
your parents back.

1654
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:10,415
I can't. I can't do that.
It's not possible.

1655
02:08:13,987 --> 02:08:16,754
I would like to. Of course,
I would. But I can't.

1656
02:08:18,058 --> 02:08:20,925
And I am sorry.
I am truly very sorry.

1657
02:08:26,232 --> 02:08:29,400
We won't take you, if you
don't want to come with us.

1658
02:08:31,404 --> 02:08:33,171
We can find you
another family.

1659
02:08:33,173 --> 02:08:34,806
Leo: Yes.

1660
02:08:34,808 --> 02:08:36,407
Raisa: We promise you.

1661
02:08:38,278 --> 02:08:40,344
We won't leave you here.

1662
02:08:42,282 --> 02:08:46,417
Now we will go out for a walk
and you can think about it.

1663
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:49,187
And then take your time.

1664
02:08:56,129 --> 02:08:57,462
(Sniffling)

1665
02:09:04,771 --> 02:09:05,870
Leo:<i> Raisa.</i>

1666
02:09:13,313 --> 02:09:14,779
Do you think

1667
02:09:17,150 --> 02:09:18,416
that I am...

1668
02:09:21,054 --> 02:09:22,987
That I am

1669
02:09:22,989 --> 02:09:25,990
truly a frightful man?

1670
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:29,527
You think that maybe I am

1671
02:09:32,098 --> 02:09:33,297
a monster?

1672
02:09:38,338 --> 02:09:40,304
No.

1673
02:09:40,306 --> 02:09:41,472
No?

1674
02:09:57,857 --> 02:09:59,023
(Door closes)
