From Brooklyn to Greenwich

the paintings to match.

So, who did it?

1072
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:00,683

01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:22,914
Friedrich Golchan.

1078
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,084
He said you did.

1079
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:29,962

if l want paint,
it just comes FedEx

think it's therapy

1081

in my cell from the original?

1082
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:55,196

1083
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,823
Nothin'.

1091
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:19,303

was a connection
between them, that's all.

1092

and that old man?
