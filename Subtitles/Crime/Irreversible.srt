1
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,915
Shall I tell you something?

2
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,748
Time ruins everything.

3
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,234
I just made that up.

4
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,515
What happened to you?

5
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,674
I will tell you.

6
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,993
I spent some time in prison
because...

7
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,913
because I had sex with my daughter.

8
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,471
The western syndrome.

9
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,880
I think about it all the time.

10
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,478
It was everything I had left,
I had nothing else.

11
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,075
I never had anything.

12
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,356
It was cute.

13
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,795
Easy now.

14
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,478
We`re all... mefisto`s.

15
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,636
I want to bring you some fun.

16
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,038
Guys who fool around a bit and
then hear it`s something bad.

17
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,635
That it`s dramatic.

18
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,473
But you can`t forget the joy
and the happiness.

19
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,151
There are no...

20
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,277
There are no crimes,
only actions.

21
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,878
I have to start over.

22
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,996
I have to quit, I have to live.

23
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,317
Keep on fighting, staying alive.

24
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,239
I understand you completely.
Do you have something to drink?

25
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,870
No, I don¢¥t have anything to drink.

26
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,517
I have no penny.
Oh what...

27
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,153
What¢¥s that noise outside?

28
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,920
Nothing.

29
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,352
The assholes from downstairs.

30
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,599
They give their usual show
in the Rectum.

31
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,519
Right.
- Rectum!

32
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,517
What kind of crime?
- With blood.

33
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,315
Blood? Does someone have
her period or something?

34
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,636
May I wait here for a while?

35
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,037
They still owe me money.
WHat happened?

36
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,515
I told you those bastards
wouldn`t pay.

37
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,233
Step aside please.

38
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,797
Morad, check out that guys
fucked up face.

39
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,116
Is your leg fucked up, pal?

40
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,356
Your ass too, I hope.

41
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,439
Like Alex. I hope you bleed a lot. 
And that you`re in a lot of pain.

42
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,949
His asshole must have
bled a lot.

43
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,276
Fucker. Fag.

44
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,632
Because of those two guys
the fuckers got us.

45
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,831
They will be happy in the street.

46
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,759
But I want my money.

47
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,509
Why are we still standing here?
We`ll get our money or go.

48
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,951
Fucking fags.
There are gays all over here.

49
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,594
It`s god damn impossible,
they are everywhere.

50
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,711
Clear the path.

51
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,791
Get rid of that asshole.

52
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,992
And cuff him.

53
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,111
They will fuck him in the
ass in prison.

54
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,118
I`m waiting for my money.
- Move it.

55
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,836
I hope you`ll be miserable in jail
and that they fuck you in the ass.

56
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,556
Fucking history and philosophy
teacher.

57
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,275
Fuscking moron.
- All philosophers are fags.

58
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,591
I hope they get you hard.

59
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,553
To the station.
- In prison there are no condoms.

60
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,274
You`ll get aids straigh away, fag.

61
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,718
What are you doing?
- I`m looking for The Tapeworm.

62
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,673
You have to pay.
- I`m already paying.

63
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,313
Go ahead.

64
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,633
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

65
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,633
We`ll find him,
we`ll find him.

66
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,309
You`re not human anymore. Even animals 
don`t revenge themselves, Marcus.

67
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,794
It`s going totally wrong.

68
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,558
Leave me alone.
- You won`t survive.

69
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,069
It`s none of your business.
- It smells like shit here.

70
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,952
Quit it, Marcus.

71
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,152
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
- No.

72
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,111
Marcus, come back!
I won`t save you.

73
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,794
Marcus, stop it now.

74
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,594
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
- No.

75
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,032
Pierre!

76
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,590
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

77
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,039
Do you know The Tapeworm?

78
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,831
The Tapeworm?

79
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,232
Pierre!

80
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,080
It goes on downstairs.
We`re going once.

81
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,319
We`re going down once.
Come on, one time. Help me, Pierre.

82
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,117
Do you know The Tapeworm?

83
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,276
Why are you smiling?

84
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,910
The Tapeworm...
Do you know The Tapeworm? No?

85
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,350
let me go! Don`t you know him?

86
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,672
Do you know The Tapeworm?
- Do you want to suck my cock?

87
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,348
No.
Do you know where The Tapeworm is?

88
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,596
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

89
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,950
Do you want to suck my dick?

90
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,470
Come back. You want to fuck?

91
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,114
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
He`s here often.

92
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,550
Maybe upstairs.

93
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,430
The Tapeworm...
Are you The Tapeworm?

94
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,319
Let me go.
Do you know The Tapeworm?

95
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,995
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm? He`s here often.
- Doesn`t ring a bell.

96
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,589
Do you work here often?
- Yes, but it doesn`t ring a bell.

97
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,679
Don`t you know him either?
- Search. You won`t find him far from here.

98
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,874
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

99
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,553
The Tapeworm? No.

100
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,550
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

101
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,276
Do you know The Tapeworm?
- I have him in my stomach.

102
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,312
Do you know The Tapeworm?

103
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,958
You there. Do you know The Tapeworm?

104
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,799
Yes, he`s my pal.
- You know him?

105
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,629
He`s my friend, I said.
- Where is he?

106
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,229
Take me to him.
- He`s fucking a fag.

107
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,069
Forget The Tapeworm. Fist me.
- Don`t touch me.

108
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,989
Come on fist me.
- Keep your hands off me.

109
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,397
Shut up. Take me to him.
- Fist me.

110
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,511
Fist me then!
- Take me to him.

111
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,551
Fist me! What kind of guy are you?

112
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,830
Keep quiet! I`m not a fag.

113
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,669
Where is he? Come on.
- I`ll take you to The Tapeworm.

114
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,111
Take me to him!
- Two hands up your ass!

115
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,040
Stop it.

116
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,629
Are you sure you want
to see The Tapeworm?

117
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,116
Fist me, that`s much better.

118
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,109
Are you sure you want to see
him? Fisting me is much better.

119
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,268
I like you.
You make me think about someone else.

120
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,156
Take me to him, I said.
Take it easy.

121
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,954
Take me to him. Where is he?

122
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,391
Give me a drink.
- Give him a drink.

123
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,955
Drink! Where is he?

124
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,230
One Pepsi.
- Where is he?

125
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,036
The Tapeworm? In your ass.
The Tapeworm is in your ass. You know?

126
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,713
You want my fist against your yaw,
fucking fag?

127
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,673
Where is he? I know him.

128
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,678
I know him. Bring me to him.

129
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,111
Damned parachutist.
- Take me to him.

130
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,279
You should fuck their brains out.
Show them you`re a hero.

131
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,111
Dammit, is that what you want?
Take me to him.

132
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,039
Take me to him!
- I confess!

133
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,310
Take me to him!
- I confess!

134
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,193
Take me to him!
- I confess, dammit!

135
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,190
Go on! Go on!
Where is he?

136
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,115
Hurry up dammit!
- The Tapeworm is dangerous.

137
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,032
Are you sure you want to see
The Tapeworm?

138
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,751
Hit me one more time.

139
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,757
Where is he?
- There he is.

140
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,678
Fuck off.

141
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,440
What`s happening?
- Who`s The Tapeworm here?

142
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,110
Are you The Tapeworm?
I asked you something.

143
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,630
Who`s The Tapeworm?

144
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,593
Who`s The Tapeworm?

145
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,551
Who`s The Tapeworm?
I asked you something. Gone with that.

146
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,591
Who`s The Tapeworm?
You know him?

147
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,597
Who`s The Tapeworm?

148
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,758
Who?
- What do you want from The Tapeworm?

149
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,430
I¢¥m looking for him.
Are you The Tapeworm perhaps?

150
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,517
Are you him?

151
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,999
Come on, fuck him! Fuck him!

152
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,591
Stop it!

153
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,158
Fucking fag!

154
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,036
Fucking fag!

155
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,556
Stop it!

156
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,915
Nice work. Good.

157
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,513
Fucking slit-eye.

158
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,315
Quit your insanity.
- We`re getting near.

159
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,556
Stop it.
- Wait, I`m asking.

160
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,194
Well, I`m waiting.

161
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,153
Where`s the Rectum?
- Which Rectum?

162
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,114
A fag bar.
- Do you need one?

163
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,753
Is it a whore bar?

164
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,679
Do you want my cock up your rectum?

165
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,838
Don¢¥t you know The Rectum?
- I only know this here.

166
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,632
Aren`t you a fag?

167
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,990
Where`s The Rectum?

168
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,190
What are you doing?

169
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,394
What are you doing?
- Who are you going to hit now?

170
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,398
Come on.
- Yes, I have nothing else to do.

171
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,996
Do you know a place that...

172
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,477
The Rectum, do you know it?

173
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,468
The Rectum, a gay bar.
You know it?

174
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,955
That way, I think.
- There?

175
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,038
It`s over there! Come on!

176
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,870
What are you doing? Come on!

177
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,269
We`re close!

178
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,712
Are you coming?

179
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,308
Come on!
- Stop it!

180
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,475
Are you being pussy too now?

181
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,389
You`re crazy!
- We¢¥re going to The rectum! Come on!

182
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,631
Hurry up.

183
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,432
Drive!

184
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,359
Who`s followinf you?
- Drive, I said!

185
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,630
Are the whore`s after you?

186
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,432
You`re not even telling where to,

187
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,633
We`re going to The Rectum!
- The Rectum! That`s clear.

188
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,115
Everyone knows where The rectum is.

189
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,232
Could you show the way, please?

190
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,112
It`s a gay bar.

191
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,199
If you took care of Alex with that much 
energy, nothing would have happened.

192
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,552
Picture that with your little
brain, moron.

193
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,149
With your damned inhibitions!

194
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,068
Are you done preaching?
The Rectum is a gay bar.

195
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,475
Could you point it
out on a map?

196
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,353
It`s a fag bar.
Do you know what that is?

197
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,269
Are you gay?
- No! I`m looking for a gay bar.

198
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,550
Don`t you know some bars?

199
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,150
A lot.
- Well, take us to a gay bar.

200
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,716
You are gay.
- No! And now shut up.

201
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,832
Be quiet now and
leave me alone.

202
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,395
Sorry, sir.
- Take us to The Rectum.

203
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,752
Take it easy, marcus.
I`m going crazy here.

204
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,712
I don`t know a Rectum.

205
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,229
Don`t you have a phone?
Cal then!

206
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,715
Don`t you have
slit-eye friends?

207
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,354
Don`t insult me
or I will beat you up.

208
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,913
Bring me to The Rectum.

209
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,079
I will beat him up too, sir.
Don`t take it ill of him.

210
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,475
He`s crazy. It`s a moron.
- Doesn`t matter.

211
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,877
Okay, take it easy. Easy.

212
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,799
One bar with guys.
- Guys?

213
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,357
Try to get your brain working,
fucking asshole.

214
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,233
Take me to The Rectum.
- Get out now.

215
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,590
Shut up and get out.

216
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,837
Just try to get me
out, fucker.

217
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,349
Get out, please.
I am fed up with it.

218
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,269
Alex would be ashamed.
- Get out now. Hurry.

219
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,631
Take it easy, we`re getting out.

220
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,400
get out, I said! Get out!

221
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,439
What do you want
with that pepperspray?

222
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,235
Filthy asshole!
- Get out!

223
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,911
Stop it! Get out, please.
I am fed up with it.

224
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,429
How much do I owe you?

225
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,679
Stop it, Marcus!
Fucking stop it!

226
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,756
Fuck off!

227
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,838
Fuck off! Go on!
- My taxi!

228
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,635
You`re crazy! Stupid fucker!

229
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,273
Drop dead, filthy Chinese.

230
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,439
You`re insane!
- We`re going to The Rectum.

231
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,188
Stop it now with
your stupid revenge.

232
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,312
We`ll pay, we¢¥ll pay.
- Only whore¢¥s are here.

233
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,670
It`s the whore street.
They don¢¥t know anything else.

234
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,839
That¢¥s not your business.
- Stop it! Why, not my business?

235
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,430
Stop it! What, did you want to hit me?

236
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,758
Don¢¥t stay here.
We will give you money.

237
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,279
We¢¥re going to Alex
in the hospital.

238
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,074
Which girl do you know?

239
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,353
What do you want to do?
Being more stupid than...

240
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,278
You don¢¥t know who it was.

241
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,118
Don¢¥t you wnat to know?

242
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,996
Nobody knows who it is.
And you¢¥re not helping Alex with that.

243
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,873
I will give you money.
- Well, who do you know?

244
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,629
It¢¥s a bit further.
- What will you get with anger?

245
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,559
What kind of crazy
revenge is this?

246
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,479
Come to Alex
in the hospital.

247
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,753
You want to hit me? Is that it?
What¢¥s wrong with you dammit?

248
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,236
Then go to the hospital.

249
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,479
You know those two?
- Ask those whores.

250
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,159
What¢¥s his name?
- Guillermo Nunez.

251
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,828
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?

252
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,828
What?

253
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,471
What does she say?
- Ask the other one.

254
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,956
Donna, I know her.
I meant her.

255
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,109
We deliver better work
than the cops.

256
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,595
Drunkards with a gun.
Zuipschuiten met 'n pistool.

257
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,472
The police, they are morons.
De politie, dat zijn eikels.

258
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,511
What do you know, teacher?

259
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,757
The human stupidity,
that¢¥s what I know. In a mass.

260
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,918
Which one is it?
- There.

261
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,599
She?
- Donna!

262
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,314
Stop it!
- I didn¢¥t do anything!

263
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,273
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?
- No.

264
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,913
you don¢¥t know Guillermo Nunez?

265
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,917
He¢¥s my friend.
- You don¢¥t know him?

266
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,190
Nobody knows Guillermo Nunez.

267
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,516
Who is it? Tell me.

268
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,510
What does she say? Concha?
The blonde?

269
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,756
Thank you, Donna.

270
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,955
Concha, are you Concha?

271
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,037
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?

272
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,878
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?

273
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,640
Keep your hands off her.
Leave her alone.

274
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,432
We won¢¥t do her anything.

275
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,710
Marcus, she didn¢¥t do anything.

276
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,753
Who do you think we are?
- Fuck off.

277
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,072
Are you crazy, Marcus?

278
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,630
Answer me!
It¢¥s about a rape.

279
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,478
Please!
- Rape, you hear?

280
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,240
Marcus, please!
- Rape!

281
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,512
Are you totally?
- Easy now.

282
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,757
Leave her alone
or I won¢¥t pay.

283
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,509
Take it easy. Stop it, stop it.

284
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,875
Let go!
- I will push!

285
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,312
Come on, dammit. Alex...
- Tell him to stop,

286
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,273
Stop it now, Marcus. Please.

287
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,472
Are you crazy?
You¢¥re fucking insane!

288
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,558
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?
Tell me.

289
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,236
Who is Guillermo Nunez?

290
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,193
Who is Jo? I don¢¥t know a Jo.
- I am Guillemo.

291
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,149
lk ben Guillermo.

292
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,874
You have become a transvestite,
great.

293
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,595
I will pay you now.
- That will tell she was there.

294
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,473
No.
- Did you see it?

295
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,989
Pick up! Go on.

296
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,634
Stop it, Marcus.
- What did you see?

297
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,674
Cut out her eye.
- Come on, stab!

298
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,235
Fuck off, you.
- Tell me.

299
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,316
It¢¥s The Tapeworm. I know him.

300
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,919
The Tapeworm is a pimp.

301
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,554
Where can we find him?

302
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,399
Where? I will rebuild
your transvestite face.

303
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,353
Where is he?
- Where can I find him?

304
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,996
What¢¥s the name of that club?
- Rectum.

305
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,078
A Tapeworm in The Rectum?
Are you playing me?

306
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,477
It¢¥s a nightclub
for gays.

307
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,755
There¢¥s a taxi!

308
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,912
Taxi!

309
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,796
Did you use alcohol?

310
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,635
No. No drugs either?

311
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,798
No drugs?

312
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,639
But according to your
so-called colleague...

313
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,071
you used drugs regulary.

314
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,238
He can say whatever he wants.
- Is it true or not?

315
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,431
I didn¢¥t use anything.

316
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,437
And the victim?

317
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,315
I don¢¥t know.
- No? Didn¢¥t you live together?

318
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,756
Did you live together?

319
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,591
Don¢¥t you want to answer?

320
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,954
You don¢¥t make it easy for us.

321
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,037
Did you leave before
or after the victim?

322
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,310
Pull yourself together.
- After, after.

323
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,193
After? how much after?
- 15 minutes.

324
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,595
Now that¢¥s an answer.

325
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,833
15 minutes.

326
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,350
And when did Mr. Marcus
go outside?

327
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,630
He came in the alley with me.

328
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,910
He came in the alley with you.

329
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,395
Did he leave sometime 
earlier in the evening?

330
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,314
I don¢¥t know.
- You don¢¥t know?

331
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,917
Did you notice
something special?

332
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,749
Were there people
around the victim?

333
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,589
Did she talk to certain people?
Did she have a fight with someone?

334
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,190
No? With you maybe?

335
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,836
With Mr. Marcus?

336
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,676
And didn¢¥t you have
a fight with Marcus?

337
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,160
You didn¢¥t have a
fight with Mr. Marcus?

338
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,877
I will need a phone number
where I can reach you.

339
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,631
I¢¥m listening

340
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,914
01 ... 44... 76... 12... 26.

341
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,749
Good. Is that your private number?

342
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,479
Is it your private number?

343
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,477
Give him back his papers.

344
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,079
Take your papers back.

345
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,429
Take your papers.

346
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,996
I will contact you when
I need you. You may go.

347
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,233
Go ahead, it¢¥s allright.
You may go.

348
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,152
Good evening.
Are you allright?

349
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,798
The woman who was attacked...
is she someone you know?

350
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,472
You don¢¥t feel very good, huh?
It¢¥s tough.

351
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,879
You always think it only happens
to other people, but if it happens to you,

352
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,832
you are helplessly lost.

353
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,315
Are you counting on the cops?

354
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,918
What do you think the police
will do? Nothing, and you know that.

355
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,999
Will they find the perpetrator?

356
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,997
Will they put him in jail?

357
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,272
Will they give him food and clothes?
Will they wash him?

358
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,277
Will they give him a doctor?

359
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,358
Your girlfriend didn¢¥t
get a doctor.

360
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,954
Who are you?

361
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,833
Who I am?
As a matter of fact...

362
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,110
I could become your best friend.

363
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,200
I cna help you find the perpetrator.

364
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,829
You look honest.
Nicely dressed.

365
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,190
Obviously you have money.

366
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,712
If you have some money, we could
help you get revenge.

367
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,114
The perpetrator spilled blood.
Blood shouts for revenge.

368
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,069
Revenge is a human right.

369
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,956
Laid, come over.

370
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,557
You understand it right away.
Explain who we are.

371
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,591
This here is our neighbourhood.

372
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,588
We find everyone, faster than
the morons over there.

373
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,597
Exactly.
- Listen to him.

374
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,351
Not very long ago someone
was raped here.

375
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,628
We have found the perpetrator.

376
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,071
We made him clear not to
do it again.

377
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,671
Do you want revenge or not?

378
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,599
Or do you want him to go to prison?

379
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,868
You hesitate?
- Do you know him?

380
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,119
Ofcourse. We found a hand bag
with identity.

381
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,593
The name was Guillermo Nunez.

382
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,837
Are you in?
Pay and we deliver him.

383
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,919
You shouldn¢¥t hesitate.
You¢¥re hurting yourself.

384
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,430
What¢¥s wrong? You¢¥re shivering.

385
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,792
This is only for men.
Don¢¥t be a pussy. Okay?

386
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,191
Are you in or not?
Man yourself.

387
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,958
Take me with you.
- Are you in?

388
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,118
We¢¥ll leave the cops for what they are.
- Come.

389
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,437
Go home then.
- You don¢¥t realize your luck.

390
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,234
Shall I...
- You¢¥re ruining it with Alex.

391
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,396
I¢¥ll give you money for a taxi.

392
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,273
You¢¥re ruining the party
the whole evening.

393
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,118
What¢¥s happening?
- A whore got raped.

394
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,151
You won¢¥t get through
- We want a taxi.

395
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,157
No, gentlemen.
- We only want a taxi.

396
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,032
No, gentlemen.
- Don¢¥t act so stupid.

397
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,435
Something happened,
the street is blocked.

398
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,158
Alex!

399
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,558
Wait!

400
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,472
Alex! What happened?

401
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,831
Sir, take it easy.
- What happened?

402
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,192
She has been raped and is in a coma now.
Sir, please.

403
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,278
Let us do our work, sir.

404
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,517
Sir, take it easy.
Just let us do our work.

405
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,871
Take him away.
- Sir, please.

406
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,311
We can¢¥t work like that.
- Take him away.

407
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,916
Who are you, sir?

408
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,994
Is she your wife?
- Do you know that man?

409
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,279
I will have to ask you some questions.
Who are you?

410
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,914
She¢¥s my wife.
- Do you know that man?

411
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,868
Sir, please.
- She is my wife.

412
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,230
Keep him on a distance.

413
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,995
It¢¥s dangerous.
Please go around the tunnel.

414
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,156
Thank you.

415
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,874
Here! Filthy bitch.

416
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,398
Filthy bitch, you¢¥re dead.
Hold on, you.

417
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,468
Wait!

418
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,634
Wait!
- Leave me alone.

419
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,592
Wait, I said.

420
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,550
Would you just shut up?
I won¢¥t do you anything.

421
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,469
Shut your fucking mouth.

422
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,559
You want to taste this?

423
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,830
Will you shut up now?

424
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,671
Fucking bitch.

425
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,393
Shall I give you a pretty smile?

426
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,678
Fucking whore.

427
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,033
Does that excite you?
Tell me.

428
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,518
Does it make you horney?

429
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,235
Well, well.

430
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,392
You are pretty hot.

431
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,399
Please...
- Shut up.

432
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,712
Leave me alone
- Shut up, I said.

433
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,633
Lift up your skirt.

434
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,070
Leave me alone.
- Lift up your skirt.

435
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,191
Shut up.

436
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,718
Dammit.
- Leave me alone, please.

437
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,396
Please.

438
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,836
Go sit on your knees.
On your knees!

439
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,993
On your knees! I¢¥m going
to fuck you . On your knees!

440
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,993
And now lie down.

441
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,193
Lie down.

442
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,432
Shut up.

443
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,831
Well, well.

444
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,474
You have a nice ass.

445
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,399
I¢¥m going to fuck you, whore.

446
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,479
Who pays for your clothes?
Your guy?

447
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,592
What an asshole that he lets 
you walk around like this outside.

448
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,756
You little whore.

449
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,876
Shut up!
Shut up or I¢¥ll kill you.

450
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,833
Understand?
Shut up or I¢¥ll kill you.

451
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,438
Dammit!

452
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,393
Open your legs! Open your legs!
Open your legs, dammit!

453
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,231
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

454
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,638
Lay still... Don¢¥t move.
I¢¥m going to fuck you in your ass.

455
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,671
I will fuck your ass untill it bleeds!

456
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,952
I will fuck your ass like
you have never fucked.

457
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,711
You little whore.
Don¢¥t move.

458
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,910
You¢¥ve been fucked
in your ass before, huh?

459
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,318
Does your guy do it in your ass?
Do you like it?

460
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,078
Dammit.

461
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,433
Don¢¥t move, dammit!

462
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,318
Lay still, don¢¥t move.

463
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,031
Don¢¥t move, don¢¥t move.

464
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,115
Don¢¥t move, dammit!

465
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,871
Dammit!

466
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,277
You have a nice tight ass.

467
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,517
I will fuck your ass untill it bleeds!

468
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,271
If you dare to shit,
you die. Understand?

469
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,039
Fucking bitch.

470
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,557
You have such a tight ass.

471
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,230
A nice fag ass.

472
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,240
Usually I don¢¥t like that.

473
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,910
Bitch. But this time...

474
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,275
Will you shut up already?

475
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,916
Whore! in your ass!

476
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,392
You¢¥ve never been fucked in
your ass like this, huh?

477
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,874
Dammit, is that blood or cum?

478
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,197
Your ass is getting bigger, huh?
Are you bleeding?

479
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,671
Dammit.

480
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,073
Oh yeah, nice.

481
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,832
Damn, that¢¥s nice.

482
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,830
Tell your daddy it¢¥s nice.

483
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,556
Tell daddy it¢¥s nice.

484
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,035
Say daddy to me.
Say daddy.

485
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,596
Say daddy, bitch!

486
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,676
Shut up!

487
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,878
Dammit.

488
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,279
Dammit.... God damnit

489
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,157
Good.

490
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,551
That was nice.

491
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,311
Where are you going, bitch?

492
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,278
WHere are you going?

493
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,111
Where are you going like that?

494
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,790
Did you think I was
done with you?

495
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,998
Little whore.
Look at me.

496
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,636
Look at me when
I¢¥m talking to you.

497
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,118
Look at me, dammit.

498
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,993
Filthy bitch, look at me.

499
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,799
Little whore. Fucking bitch.

500
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,228
Come here!

501
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,556
Ugly bitch!
Bitch!

502
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,869
You think you can do anything, huh?

503
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,152
You think you can do anything
because you're beautiful, huh?

504
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,153
Dirty cunt! Dirty...
Come here!

505
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,515
I'm gonna hit your face real hard!

506
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,995
I'm not finished with you!

507
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,158
Come here! Here! Here!

508
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,556
Fucking bitch! Here!

509
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,430
Are you happy now? Or do you want
some more?

510
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,189
Want some? Fucking whore!
Please!

511
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,550
Little cunt, that you are!
Over here!

512
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,320
This is for your rotten face!

513
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,637
Now I'm all finished with you.
Fucking cunt.

514
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,956
What do you want to say to me?

515
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,118
You do not care about my 
sexuality.

516
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,108
But you engage me in it.
-You never talk about yours.

517
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,992
Because there is nothing to tell.

518
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,350
What is it then?
-There is always something.

519
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,915
What are you doing with your dick?

520
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,554
Don't bitch about it.
-Are you gonna keep it to wanking? 

521
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,594
Don't be like that. I think about
Alex and you, and that's painful.

522
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,598
You are alone for 3 years now.
-So what?

523
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,518
What do you do?

524
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,111
You are sent by God,
because my pal Pierre...

525
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,912
has a problem.
-What about it?

526
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,159
We must find a way to losen

527
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,635
Pierre a bit up.

528
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,435
I want to take care of that.
-You see...but how?

529
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,996
You are with two
and I'm not alone either.

530
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,555
In the toilets.
-Now shut up.

531
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,035
That's where it happens all the time.
-Alex is alone.

532
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,310
Come on.
-Go, Pierre.

533
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,593
You are saying that I bitch about
your sexuality, and what about you?

534
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,678
Are you afraid?
-Pierre is very nice.

535
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,589
Forget it. I know how it goes.
We make fun,

536
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,199
we get completly stoned...

537
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,359
but I did that 15 years, 30 years ago.

538
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,710
Hello.
-Don't do that.

539
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,196
Stop it, Marcus.
Leave me alone.

540
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,279
You can't do that to Alex.
Leave Fatima alone.

541
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,835
Fatima, come on.

542
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,510
Don't do it. You are going to regret
if you sober up.

543
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,996
Forget about it. Come on.
Go with me.

544
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,998
He's very nice.
First a present.

545
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,715
Don't do that shit.
Leave it.

546
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,956
Stop it, Pierre.

547
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,549
Stop it. Don't do it.

548
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,115
You are a pain in the ass.

549
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,437
And, girls?

550
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,553
Delicious.

551
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,478
I got to go see Pierre

552
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,319
who only loves rats and
may not be left alone.

553
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,509
Are you coming back?

554
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,551
Soon?
-Yeah. Thanks, girls.

555
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,069
Are you going to leave us alone?

556
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,835
This is Pierre
and he needs your love.

557
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,918
Alex is dancing all alone.
Don't be an moron.

558
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,590
Give him some pleasure, ladies.
-Piss off.

559
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,588
You are saying that I bitch about
your sexuality and what do you do?

560
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,077
I know. Come on, Marcus.
I really hate it when you act like that.

561
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,159
If you are not doing it for me,
then do it for her.

562
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,032
No, Marcus stays here.

563
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,836
Come on. Don't be such an idiot.

564
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,548
Alex has to dance all by himself.
Come on.

565
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,034
Leave him.

566
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,152
Here I am!
-Come on.

567
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,399
Marcus, you are fantastic.
-It's rotten, Marcus.

568
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,158
That's life, mate.

569
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,557
Then it didn't have any sense 
to bring her along.

570
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,159
Why did you bring her if you 
are doing it that way?

571
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,828
Why are you doing it that way?
Come on, have a drink.

572
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,429
You are in need of a glass of water

573
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,559
You don't have to act like that.

574
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,320
You take her with you and...
-Look at the ladies.

575
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,637
You can be a dickhead 
without being with her too.

576
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,717
Stay with her.

577
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,990
You need to have some fun.
-Do you call this fun?

578
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,192
Yes, this is fun.
You are just like a priest.

579
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,550
I feel like a nanny.
-Our little priest.

580
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,116
I go with a teenager loaded
with drugs.

581
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,788
Have some water. Come on.

582
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,434
Have a drink.

583
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,313
Here, drink the water. From the sink.

584
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,478
Give me a shot of water from the sink.

585
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,672
There was a queue at the john.
I couldn't piss.

586
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,998
Stop it, Marcus.
-I opened the tap.

587
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,237
Leave it.
-Come on, quit it.

588
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,750
Quit it, Pierre.
Before you fuck up everything.

589
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,030
Come on.
-You are not funny.

590
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,835
It's not funny like that.
They'll see you.

591
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,758
You are even more fierce then an animal.

592
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,757
You are not funny.

593
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,438
Did you come for that, dickhead?
-What, dickhead?

594
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,438
I came to watch them dance,
therefore I'm a dickhead.

595
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,029
Don't be like that, Marcus. Really.

596
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,435
Look how beautiful she is.
Look how she dances.

597
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:24,555
Look how gorgeous. Brunette, 
blonde, brunette, blonde.

598
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,116
Behave like an adult.
-We'll fuck'em all.

599
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,880
Found your girlfriends?
-So?

600
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,638
Hello.
- What's your name?

601
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,796
Joanna. Is that you?
- Vincent.

602
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,309
Hello, Vincent.
- No, my name is Marcus.

603
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,748
And you?
- Aurele.

604
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,475
Aurele? This is Alex.

605
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,477
No, that's Alex.
- I know.

606
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,717
I'm Marcus.
Marcus.

607
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,917
Come on.
-I've had it with that cunt.

608
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,317
Don't be so annoying.
-He brings misfortune.

609
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,239
I give him some pussy.
He doesn't want them.

610
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,839
I give him coke, he doesn't like it.

611
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,918
I present him a glass, he says no.
Such a bore.

612
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,550
You picked a weird one as lean 
as a lath, Alex.

613
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,433
No, I rather watch you.

614
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,995
I bear heavy secrets.
-Dance with me.

615
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,794
Let me have a look at you.
You didn't use to dance.

616
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,913
There is the hairy monkey.
Stop it, Marcus.

617
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,236
Do something.
What has he swallowed?

618
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,829
Stop it.

619
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,276
In the past you never danced.
-I dance with you.

620
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,109
You dance to forget, huh?
Your Marcus is out of his mind.

621
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,596
What are you doing?
You didn't use to dance like that.

622
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,394
In the past you didn't dance that way.

623
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,511
Let yourself go.
-I'm completly relaxed.

624
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,508
Dance with me.
-You scare me. You're never like this.

625
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,518
I never saw you like this.
There you have got him again.

626
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,712
Do I scare you?
-Funny, huh?

627
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,790
Do you think that's funny?
I can do it too.

628
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,549
Please. Dance with me.

629
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,990
I'm with you. I look at you.

630
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,909
You are in great shape.
Remember? Be careful.

631
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,429
You are playing a dangerous game,
Alex.

632
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,993
Marcus has a lot of fun.
-Come with me.

633
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,871
Very nice to see you.
-The pleasure is all mine. How are you?

634
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,877
I'm going to say hi to a few mates.

635
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,674
Everything okay?
Sorry.

636
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,438
Everything okay?

637
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,873
How about you?

638
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,669
And?
-And, does it grow?

639
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,189
He never knows when to quit.

640
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,914
I'm happy. You look hot.

641
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,680
Quit it.

642
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,394
I really enjoy it to see you

643
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,873
I'm completly wasted from the dancing.

644
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,355
I've also danced alot.
-Everything okay?

645
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:37,269
I'm happy.
I'm in a very special period.

646
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,392
I'll tell you about it.
I'm here with a guy.

647
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,319
Pierre?
- No.

648
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,115
I'm with Marcus.

649
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,829
I think he's completely insane.
-Yeah, it looks like it.

650
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,873
I want to have dinner with you
one evening.

651
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,116
Thank you.
-Then I'll tell you all.

652
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,958
She must tell me everything.

653
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,754
What does she have to tell?
-I don't know.

654
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,631
Are you alright?
-Yeah, of course.

655
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,719
Okay. Will you call me?
-Promised.

656
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,069
Well...

657
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,115
See you later.

658
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,194
Stop it.
- What?

659
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,196
What did you take?

660
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,233
Nothing. Nothing at all.

661
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,672
I'm sober as water.
My name is Jean-Francois.

662
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,077
Did you see your eyes?
-What's wrong with them?

663
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,713
You don't control your mouth.

664
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,673
You don't control your breasts.

665
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,479
Quit it, I want to rest.
-I've been looking for you for a while.

666
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,272
I was dancing.

667
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,233
Why do you have to swallow pills
to make fun?

668
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,592
I don't know. It's fun.
-You are no longer 15.

669
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,998
Sometimes you can be very sweet...

670
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,397
and soft, and at other moments 
you can be a real moron.

671
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,876
Quit it, Alex.
-I want to go home.

672
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,789
I want to go home, I want some rest.

673
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,231
I'll bring you home.
-You look like a ghost.

674
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,273
Stop it, you are annoying me.
-Wait, I'll bring you home.

675
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,072
Don't touch me.

676
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,753
Come on!

677
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,197
I'll bring you home, I told you!

678
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,595
Alex, goddammit!

679
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,951
I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

680
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,515
I'm tired.
- But you're only here for an hour.

681
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,029
I want to go home.
-A minute ago, you were still dancing.

682
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,913
What's wrong?
-He's completely stoned.

683
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,519
I know.
-Take care of him.

684
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,359
He doesn't need me, you do.
-No I don't.

685
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,835
Don't worry.
I'll call you tomorrow.

686
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,838
No. I came for you.
To see you.

687
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,953
It has been months. I have to make 
up something to see you.

688
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,072
To see you dance.
-Don't torture yourself like that.

689
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,111
I don't.
I can take it.

690
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,629
It's from esthetical pleasure.

691
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,230
From nostalgia to see you again.
Don't go away.

692
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,192
I'll call you tomorrow. Promised.

693
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,118
Why?
-You are a darling.

694
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,711
No, I'm not a darling. It's 
uncareful to leave you alone.

695
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,276
I'm reading a very good book.
-How long?

696
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,755
Months.
-How many pages? 43?

697
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,554
It's really good.

698
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,830
After the index it's with each page...

699
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,395
What's it about?
-Well, it says...

700
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,319
The book?
-The book says...

701
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:37,673
It seems to be that the future is
completely decided already. Everything is fixed.

702
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,637
And the proof is the prophetic dreams.

703
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:45,435
Beautiful. That gets us asleep
at least.

704
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,553
Who knows what we are going to dream.
-You should write...

705
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,638
Sometimes I dream that I'm asleep.
My only dream.

706
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,592
Come on.
-Then you get relaxed.

707
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,360
Very suspenseful.
-Direction Louis Blanc.

708
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,599
Isn't that our stop?
-No, the next one.

709
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,676
You have to sleep.
Do you sleep 2 hours?

710
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,271
How many times did collapse,
after hours of work.

711
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,436
Was it good? Tell me.

712
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,596
You can't do it either, huh?
Terrible, huh?

713
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,234
What will make you come? 

714
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,159
Stop it.
Why do you say something like that?

715
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,555
It's your own fault, if you go out
with your ex boy-friends

716
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,239
You can't make her come, huh?

717
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,432
We'll explain it to you one time.
-No, seriously.

718
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,279
What?
-Does he really make you come?

719
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,790
I don't say...
-You don't have to say anything.

720
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,993
Quit it. He with his monkey face.
Tell me.

721
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,031
Come on.

722
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,869
Don't be like that.
"Yes, we come."

723
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,993
You see how you are now, Pierre?
You want to explain everything.

724
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,829
Do you come or not?
I haven't been able to for years.

725
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,996
Don't excite yourself.
Everything is fine.

726
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,714
That's why you're in the back
and I'm up front.

727
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,075
No, seriously. There is nobody.
-Stop it.

728
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,113
Did he do something nice
or not?

729
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,390
You don't talk about that stuff.

730
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,556
Shall we do them then?
In turns.

731
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,638
That way we'll see if it works on them.
-It's complicated.

732
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,229
Did it work or not?
You held against me that...

733
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,874
I've been thinking for a long time...
I had results.

734
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,350
Excellent results, since...

735
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,313
Can he do it?
-We're not talking about sex.

736
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,910
Why not?
-You can talk about everything...

737
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,554
We can talk about sex,
just not with you.

738
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,469
He wants to explain everything.

739
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,638
Like sex. Sex is an act, you 
don't talk about it.

740
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,752
But you can say how it is?

741
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,633
Did you enjoy a bit,
yes or no?

742
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,274
It's a vulgar question.
For me it was finished.

743
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,677
Why do you say that?
- I had to, from my cardiologist.

744
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,431
He said I would die from it.
"Her orgasm or your heart," she said.

745
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,790
Seriously.
- Stop it now.

746
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,834
there, a metro.
And it's blue with colors.

747
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,598
Did you achieve something or not?

748
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,992
Pierre!
- No, seriously.

749
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,792
We will explain everything.

750
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,070
Liar.

751
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,635
Liars have a big nose,
you have big ears.

752
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,435
Do I have a big nose?
- No, big ears. Your nose is nothing.

753
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,756
By the way, with the wind... look.

754
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,316
What an airflow.

755
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,629
Ladies and gentlemen,
a couple that cums.

756
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,998
One time...

757
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,949
One time she screamed.
- In four years, very good.

758
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,754
Because she bumped into
the pedestal.

759
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,076
Why are you acting like that?

760
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,191
The only tangible proof
of an orgasm.

761
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,868
And I believed in it.
I thought: Finally.

762
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,036
She cried. And it was bleeding.

763
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,915
You know what people say?

764
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,554
There are no women
who can't come,

765
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,070
only men who can't fuck.

766
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,429
And that's it.
-Why are you hurting yourself?

767
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,030
I am not. Tell me the truth and
I swill accept it.

768
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,879
I was too cerebral to
make her cum.

769
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,437
Then she follows a diet of banana's
and testosteron, and it's done.

770
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,518
You are trite.
- Seriously.

771
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,190
Do you do it for a banana diet?
Bravo.

772
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,871
Look at that couple going to a party 
who don't share their bed secrets.

773
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,469
You have to be able to be tender.
- And you were so progressive.

774
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,229
I'll write it down, you never know
if I find the one.

775
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,115
It has been long that..
A knot, thank you.

776
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,595
No, I kept it for you.

777
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,509
How are those things called again?
Go on, tell me.

778
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,192
A tender gesture.
- No, for you it's hopeless.

779
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,198
You won't succeed anymore.
- Tell me.

780
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,595
You take care of your rats.
You can still do that.

781
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,189
I can't make them cum.
That's illegal.

782
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,198
I'm going crazy
or I'll rape children.

783
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,198
How do you do it?
- Don't make jokes about that.

784
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,868
Alex, what was the problem?
- What do you think?

785
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,550
His onomatopoeia?
His skin? His smell?

786
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,716
Or was it the tarzan yell?

787
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,673
Unimaginable.

788
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,753
You're saying I'm too intellectual.
Now I'm asking for something simple.

789
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,520
She gives a stroke,
she goes like...

790
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,997
Maybe you can sing at the same time.

791
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,395
What's that to me?

792
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,114
Am I annoying?
- No.

793
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,676
I am annoying. Sorry.
Sir, madam.

794
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,314
Excuse me.

795
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,748
Madam is coming.

796
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,428
Madam is coming,
but keeps it to herself.

797
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,757
How far are you with Sylvie?
- Like with the others.

798
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,394
After a few hours
of extreme effort...

799
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,755
Sylvie doesn't interest me.
- You know what your problem is?

800
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,077
You act like it's a big achievement.
-What?

801
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,350
To you it's a achievement.
-What?

802
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,394
Sex. You do it, but you¢¥re not 
participating.

803
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,756
What do you tell me now?
-It's true.

804
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,669
The details of your private life
is none of my interests.

805
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,316
Excuse us, your honor.
-He started.

806
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,399
Later at the party you can continue
your discussion in the toilets.

807
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,989
Unbelievable.

808
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:23,239
What did you do more that I
couldn't do?

809
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,556
You are too old for that stuff.

810
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,150
I'm 2 years older than you are.
-A little bit more.

811
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,394
Mister starts cavilling.

812
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,273
You think too much about
the pleasure of the other.

813
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,675
You have to let yourself go lose.
-You are an altruist.

814
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,078
Get relaxed and think about yourself.
-That's selfish.

815
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:45,989
It's better like this.
Otherwise you get blocked.

816
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,839
You think too much about the
pleasure of others.

817
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,510
You get blocked because you
are not focusing on yourself.

818
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,429
In the end the pleasure of the woman,

819
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,835
is the pleasure of a man.

820
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,874
If I feel that the man isn't 
enjoying ...

821
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,390
his own pleasure...
-Wait a moment.

822
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,354
If I feel that the man doesn't go
up in his own pleasure...

823
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,198
You are not enjoying it because
I don't enjoy it?

824
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,791
No, I get blocked.
-What a bad thing to hear afterwards.

825
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,754
After all these years...
-I couldn't do it. No.

826
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,349
All this effort I took to
temper myself...

827
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,154
for hours.
I have been sweating from it.

828
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,989
Let me explain.
-And it was wrong? It had to be fast.

829
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,112
And you came two hours later,
while I was in the shower or asleep.

830
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,470
This is really fucked.

831
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,672
No, it's not like that.
-You push me too...

832
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,429
I wanted...
-He fucks and she comes hours later.

833
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,359
You can't explain.
-It's not rational.

834
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,597
Your problem is that you 
want an explanation for everything.

835
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,597
But sometimes there is no explanation.

836
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,430
It's like that talking for centuries.
Sometimes you just have to fuck.

837
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,474
And afterwards everything is solved.
I don't know why.

838
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,511
The bodies talk.
-Don't I have to talk?

839
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,792
I talked during fucking.
Remember?

840
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,788
But the bodies.
-And everything I said got you excited.

841
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,070
It was just a chat.

842
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,316
But it interested you.

843
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,432
It was never a real extacy,
but once or twice ...

844
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,518
Say it. He isn't listening anyway.
-More often.

845
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,837
Really? More often, mate! More often!

846
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,519
Mate!...more often.

847
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,075
You always talk like an intellectual.
-Me?

848
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,068
But after all it's always terra terra.
It's about sex.

849
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,510
That's good, isn't it?
-But you say he's an animal.

850
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,358
It's an essential need.

851
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,152
He doesn't possess the language.

852
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,238
"I fuck, I eat, I Marcus"

853
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,032
But I diverse.

854
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,515
I many trouble,
because I not speak the language very well.

855
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,790
The language.
-Come on now, "Language".

856
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,673
Are we there?
-I stay so I can wank myself off.

857
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,359
Well ok.

858
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,119
What a bullshit.

859
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,437
More often.
That's not bad at all.

860
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,876
Hello, Alexandra.

861
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,118
Pierre here. I've got car trouble.

862
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,390
I¢¥ll come and get you with the metro.

863
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,798
In 20 to 30 minutes.

864
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,631
I had a dream.

865
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,111
It was weird.

866
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,713
I don't have any feeling in my arm.

867
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,115
I walked through a tunnel.

868
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,317
A tunnel...

869
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,272
completely red...

870
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,672
And afterwards...

871
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,989
The tunnel broke in 2 pieces.

872
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,157
I think...

873
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,715
it's because of my menstruation.

874
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,477
Are you over time.
Remember?

875
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,556
A lot?

876
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,834
No, just a few days.

877
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,317
We'll see.

878
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,955
We had a long sleep.

879
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,833
We have to get up.
I have to buy a new bottle.

880
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,918
for the party tonight.
Pierre...

881
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,674
I have to be kind to him.

882
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,077
because in the end I stole 
his wife.

883
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,199
What?

884
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,278
And I have to be too...
-No...

885
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,313
You didn't steal anything from anyone, honey.

886
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,630
I'm ...
I'm not a thing.

887
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,308
You have not stolen anything
from anyone.

888
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,034
I have done it.
I have decided everything.

889
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,515
It's always the wife that decides.

890
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,719
Really.

891
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,038
But then again...

892
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:31,357
It's true that you decide.
By the way...

893
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,790
What do you get for me? Do you give
me parties with your ex?

894
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,560
He may be a friend.

895
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,478
But he is crazy about you.
He likes you.

896
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,036
Whatever, you will pay.
-I won't pay shit.

897
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,435
You decide and you pay for it.
-No, stop it.

898
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,518
No, wait. I'm not awake yet.

899
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,796
You'll pay for this.

900
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,514
If you hurt me, you'll pay.

901
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,597
You will pay.

902
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,997
The revenge of the elephant.
-Stop it!

903
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,634
Who kills children!

904
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,557
Stop it.

905
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,913
You know I don't like that.

906
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,394
Then I will revenge myself too.

907
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,632
With a kiss.

908
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,553
You crushed me.
-That's not true.

909
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,870
Wait, you...
-No.

910
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,355
Did I hurt you?
You're exaggerating.

911
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:49,075
You crushed my balls.
Dammit, Alex.

912
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,511
That can't be.
Did I hurt you?

913
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,798
You're a pig.

914
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,036
You're a dirty pig.

915
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:00,994
Then I will go away. I'll make
sone coffee. That will teach you.

916
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,032
Stop it.

917
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,800
Quit it.

918
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,959
I'll make some coffee.
-Make some coffee?

919
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,359
You know...
You should buy some booze.

920
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,519
Go on.

921
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,036
Okay.

922
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,918
Take a look,
I have something here that hurts.

923
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,755
No, really, I have something here.

924
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,077
Will you play some music?

925
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,872
No.

926
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,359
Alex...
- What?

927
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,996
I think I...
feel like fucking you in the ass.

928
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,715
No! I thought you were
going to say something romantic.

929
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,435
It is romantic.
- Oh? No, you know...

930
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,868
I love you.

931
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,957
I love you too.

932
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,075
And what if I were pregnant?

933
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,151
That wouldn't be so bad.

934
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,838
Yes, please.

935
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,993
Take a shower.

936
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,354
Hey, well...

937
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,239
I'm going to buy a bottle.

938
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,636
You have money?

939
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,950
Come on, stop it.
- What?

940
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,430
Do you ever have money?

941
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,598
Alright. Do you have some?

942
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,757
I'll get some from your purse.

943
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,032
See you later.

944
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,239
PREGNANCY TEST

945
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:21,988
TIME RUINS EVERYTHING
