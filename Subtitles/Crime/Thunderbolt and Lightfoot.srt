1
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,131
Man of Sorrows! What a name

2
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:25,094
For the Son of God, Who came

3
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,471
Ruined sinners to reclaim

4
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:34,106
Hallelujah!

5
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:40,400
What a saviour

6
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:47,455
Bearing shame and scoffing rude

7
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:53,792
In my place condemned He stood

8
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:59,463
Sealed my pardon with His blood

9
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:03,343
Hallelujah!

10
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:09,307
What a saviour

11
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:16,687
Guilty, vile and helpless we

12
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:23,149
Spotless Lamb of God was He

13
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:28,652
"Full atonement!" can it be

14
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,538
Hallelujah!

15
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:39,414
What a saviour

16
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:45,966
When He comes, our glorious King

17
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:51,722
All His ransomed home to bring

18
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:57,016
Then anew His song we'll sing

19
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:01,612
Hallelujah!

20
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:08,704
What a saviour

21
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,749
Remember that we are all imperfect.

22
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,881
We see but in part.
We know but in part.

23
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:29,715
So let each of us study to approve
ourselves to God through Jesus Christ.

24
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:39,897
As under the Redeemer's gentle reign,
the wolf shall dwell with the lamb,

25
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:42,779
and the leopard
shall lie down with the kid.

26
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,812
That's a repossession.

27
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:22,403
Got less than 1,000 miles on the clock.

28
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,280
- Hah!
- I wouldn't shit you, kid.

29
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,567
Hell, you kids are just
too damn smart this day and time.

30
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,944
- Try it on for size.
- Hey, thank you.

31
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,119
She's cleaner than a cat's ass.

32
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:41,877
Go on, kick her up.

33
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,630
How much?

34
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:48,968
She's practically brand-new, boy.

35
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,971
$3,000 and some change.

36
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:57,601
Well, I'm just looking, you know.

37
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,772
No, I don't know.

38
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:07,231
I mean, I don't know if you're man enough
to take on a car like this.

39
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,983
Are you?

40
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:12,988
I don't know.
I have a wooden leg.

41
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,622
You're kiddin'?

42
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,129
You wouldn't kid about a thing like that.
Would ya?

43
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,299
I'm not kidding.

44
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,929
Serious?

45
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,975
You never can tell.

46
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:45,568
Hey, come back here with my car,
you hippy sonofabitch.

47
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:48,613
Come back.
What are you doin' stealin' my car?

48
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,533
A true Christian, like his divine master,

49
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,994
is of a meek and forgiving temper.

50
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:00,749
He owes no man anything
but to love one another.

51
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,618
And he overcomes evil with good.

52
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,423
Glory to God in the highest,

53
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:13,214
and on earth,
peace and goodwill towards men.

54
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:14,462
Amen.

55
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,160
Hey, uh...

56
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,217
Whoo-hoo!

57
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:26,516
Asshole.

58
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:39,196
- I thought you were the heat.
- Do I look like heat?

59
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:43,788
You look like one crazy sonofabitch
for a preacher, I'll tell ya that.

60
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:49,040
Who's that guy back there in the wheat?

61
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,835
Old friend.

62
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:55,049
With friends like that,
you don't need enemies.

63
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,969
Which way are we headed?

64
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,009
We?

65
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,061
- All right, which way are <i>you</i> headed?
- South.

66
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:10,145
South's all right with me.

67
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:15,402
- You must like my drivin'.
- I love it.

68
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,733
- Ever thought of doin' it professionally?
- What?

69
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,610
Driving.

70
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,783
Why?

71
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:28,700
You got blue eyes. All great race
champions have blue eyes. That's a fact.

72
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:32,453
And all preachers drink like fish.
That's another fact.

73
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,714
What's your name, boy?

74
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:40,587
Lightfoot.

75
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,761
You Indian?

76
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,139
No, just American.

77
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:54,852
<i>If I knew the way, I'd go back home</i>

78
00:09:56,321 --> 00:10:02,441
<i>But the countryside has changed</i>
<i>so much, I'd surely end up lost</i>

79
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:08,998
<i>Half-remembered names and faces</i>
<i>so far in the past</i>

80
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:15,543
<i>On the other side of bridges</i>
<i>that were burned once they were crossed</i>

81
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:18,793
<i>Tell me where, where does a fool go</i>

82
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:25,131
<i>When there's no one left to listen</i>
<i>to a story without meaning</i>

83
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,267
<i>That nobody wants to hear</i>

84
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,728
<i>Tell me where, where does a fool go</i>

85
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:35,106
<i>When there's no one left to listen</i>

86
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,328
It's cold up here.

87
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,212
- How's your arm?
- Feels like lead.

88
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,378
Give me your belt, will ya?

89
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,172
Your belt, c'mon!

90
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,172
You ain't no country preacher, preacher.

91
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,545
I can tell ya that. Who are ya?

92
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:31,013
Where are the license plates?

93
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:35,354
Don't have any. I bagged it
about five minutes before I ran into you.

94
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,519
<i>Almost</i> ran into you.

95
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,648
- You like to spend money?
- When I can get it.

96
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,694
- Do you care <i>how</i> you get it?
- No. If it doesn't cost me too much.

97
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:02,962
Howdy. How's business?

98
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:07,302
In this business, you're
always one step away from bankruptcy.

99
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:10,133
Funny money, credits, speculation.

100
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:15,259
That ain't it. Somewhere in this country's
a little ol' lady with $79.25.

101
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,230
The five cents is a buffalo nickel.

102
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:22,603
That ain't it. If she cashes in her
investment, whole thing'll collapse.

103
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:27,444
General Motors, the Pentagon, the
two-party system and the whole shebang.

104
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,112
Arnold, what is he saying to you?

105
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:38,787
That's it. We're all running downhill. Gotta
keep running faster or we'll fall down.

106
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,168
Arnold, what was he saying to you?

107
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,507
Arnold?

108
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:48,093
What did he say to you?

109
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:49,548
Did he insult you?

110
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,724
I don't wish to be forward but
we'd like to exchange cars with you.

111
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,598
So the faster you get out,
the better it'll be for your ass.

112
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,520
- Arnold...
- Come on, out.

113
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:01,058
Arnold! Oh...

114
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:16,162
- I thought we were only gonna get plates?
- We didn't have a screwdriver.

115
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:22,292
Hey, look at this, man. They got
a department store back here. I like that.

116
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,706
Those clothes and your mouth,
you could be a big man.

117
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:39,389
Busy night.

118
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:45,808
- I never paid for it in my life.
- Sometimes you have to pay for pleasure.

119
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:49,063
Not me. I've never paid for it,
I can tell you that.

120
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,565
Well, this is where I get out.

121
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,152
You sure don't know a good thing
when you see it, do you?

122
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,415
Hey, why don't you take this watch, huh?

123
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,208
I want you to have it.

124
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,628
I don't want your watch, man.

125
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:10,923
I want your friendship.

126
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,967
I like you, that's all.
I thought we were gettin' to be friends.

127
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,974
We're good together.

128
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:22,387
Kid, you're ten years too late.

129
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,692
You sure are one lost dude, aren't you?

130
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,741
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

131
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:41,204
Shit.

132
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,372
You're as young as you feel.

133
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:32,755
Hello.

134
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:37,053
We gotta stop meetin' like this.
People will talk.

135
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,508
Very funny.

136
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,213
No, with a preacher, especially.

137
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:44,268
Where there's smoke, there's fire,
you know?

138
00:17:51,254 --> 00:17:53,377
How y'all doin', Kitty?

139
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,546
Quick, get in! Quick!

140
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:03,637
Hey, what is this?

141
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,390
Why walk when you can ride?

142
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,438
You sonofabitch.
Let me outta here right now.

143
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:14,100
Hey, what's the matter?
Don't you like my face?

144
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:18,030
You're the best-Iooking face
I've seen all day.

145
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:21,572
- Where are you taking me?
- Anywhere you say, sweetness.

146
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,655
- I'm hungry.
- Chilli, right?

147
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:35,714
- I didn't get your name.
- I didn't give it to ya.

148
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,248
My name is Lightfoot.

149
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,962
- Lightfoot?
- That's right.

150
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:44,472
That's a dumb name. What kind
of a person would name a kid that?

151
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:47,766
- What's your name?
- Melody.

152
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,219
Melody? That's not a dumb name?

153
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,979
Hey, maybe we had the same father.

154
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,323
Brought some goodies.

155
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:11,120
- Are you outta your mind?
- This is Gloria and Melody.

156
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,086
- Pleased to meet you.
- Melody, Gloria.

157
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:16,418
Go right in, ladies.

158
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,884
You're full of surprises.

159
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:24,799
Gloria has a great ass, doesn't she?

160
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:28,929
It's the best I've ever seen.
Wouldn't you say that, Melody?

161
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,385
I just got out of a bed to come here.

162
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:35,305
And I don't intend
to jump right back into one here.

163
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:39,819
Oh, I forgot to tell ya. Gloria is yours.

164
00:19:57,714 --> 00:20:00,798
Take it easy, Gloria. You're killin' me.

165
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:04,757
- Where did you get all those scars from?
- Marines, Korea.

166
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:07,295
Oh, yeah? I heard about that war.

167
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:15,269
Ooooh!

168
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:23,152
Mmm...

169
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,576
- What are you doin'?
- Getting dressed.

170
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:40,709
Why?

171
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,880
So you can take me home.

172
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:46,714
You can stay here tonight.

173
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,847
No, I have to get home before it's light out.

174
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:52,263
If you think I'm leavin' here at 3.30am

175
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:55,679
to take you
wherever the hell home is, you're crazy.

176
00:20:55,814 --> 00:21:00,226
You'd better take me or I'll walk out
of here stark-naked and scream "rape".

177
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,518
Sure you will.

178
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,693
That would be stupid.

179
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:12,907
Rape!

180
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,581
Rape!

181
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:21,631
- Do you think we should stay here?
- Why not?

182
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,588
Get your clothes on.

183
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:27,548
Here's some money. You can take a cab.

184
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,295
Sweets to the sweets!

185
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:22,558
How did you do?

186
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:24,732
Red-haired women are bad luck.

187
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:09,520
You sure that's their car?

188
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,363
That's their hearse.

189
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:39,424
Good morning.

190
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:41,968
Good morning, sweetness.

191
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:43,219
What'll it be?

192
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,147
I'm gonna have you.

193
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:49,642
And four scrambled eggs, very loose.

194
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,780
Bacon, toast, coffee,

195
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,442
and American fries.
You got American fries?

196
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,611
Yes.

197
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:01,491
American fries?

198
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:03,083
Right.

199
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:06,125
Just coffee, black. Thanks.

200
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:08,211
OK. Thank you.

201
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:16,806
- God, it's poetry!
- Good jowl.

202
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:19,968
I love 'em like that. Nice and tight. Jesus!

203
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:24,435
How you feelin' today, preacher?

204
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:27,689
The clock uncoils the working day,

205
00:24:27,817 --> 00:24:30,818
and he wakes up
feeling his youth has gone away.

206
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,568
Now what the hell is that? A prayer?

207
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,526
A poem.

208
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,067
- A poem?
- Poetry.

209
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:40,662
Ah.

210
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:43,624
You stick with me, kid.
You can live for ever.

211
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:57,589
Sir.

212
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:08,308
You big sonofabitch!

213
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:10,625
You must've been into something
very big, preacher. Very big.

214
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,673
I can't see.

215
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:29,897
- Damn, they're goin' fast.
- I can't see 'em.

216
00:26:30,815 --> 00:26:34,516
I don't know how the hell
I coulda missed 'em so many times.

217
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:41,325
Hang on!

218
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:47,323
He went over the...

219
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:49,414
What do we do now, Red?

220
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:51,582
Geronimo!

221
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:09,182
In a case like this, you can't take
your hands off the wheel for a second.

222
00:27:09,312 --> 00:27:11,352
Get your hands on the wheel.

223
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:15,016
A rolling stone gathers no moss.

224
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,958
Shit!

225
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,234
What do we do now, Red?

226
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:04,405
Shut up, Goody.

227
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:19,580
Goddamn ding-ding.

228
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:01,540
Yeah, transmission's finished.
Seals are all gone.

229
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:05,466
Cadillac's my car anyway.

230
00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:09,094
Where are we now?

231
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:11,307
Hell's Canyon.

232
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:13,474
Snake River.

233
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:17,352
Mostly huntin' camps and sheep camps.

234
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:24,735
Up here, people's business
is nobody's but their own.

235
00:29:25,782 --> 00:29:29,365
Delivery boat's gonna come by
pretty soon. The Idaho Dream.

236
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:31,949
Should take us right up the river.

237
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,449
Better off gettin' as far away from me
as you can, boy.

238
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:39,208
In for a penny, in for a pound.

239
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:48,175
Lonely country, kid.

240
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,935
You got any people?

241
00:29:58,857 --> 00:30:02,391
Hah! I don't even know any more.
That's weird.

242
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:07,436
Last time I saw any of them
I was just a kid.

243
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:15,540
I was a little too much for them to handle.

244
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:19,248
So they sent me away
to one of these boarding schools.

245
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,833
And on the train I met this woman.

246
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,666
Oh, man!

247
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,677
So the next thing I know, we're getting off
the train together in New Orleans.

248
00:30:30,805 --> 00:30:35,800
Two weeks later,
I wake up in some fleabag hotel.

249
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:39,101
Oh, God!

250
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:42,981
But we had ourselves a good time, man.

251
00:30:47,739 --> 00:30:50,942
So after her, things looked good.
I kept movin'.

252
00:30:51,075 --> 00:30:53,115
Now you can't stop?

253
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:59,371
Here she is.

254
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,499
Idaho Dream.

255
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,832
Did you see that?
A steelhead, man. Beautiful.

256
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:48,831
Aah... Did you see that?

257
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:51,590
Yeah.

258
00:31:52,428 --> 00:31:56,509
Well, my good friend, we're broke.
Do you have any suggestions?

259
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:02,562
If I knew what you know,
I'd never be broke.

260
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:07,267
What do you <i>think</i> I know
that you would <i>like</i> to know?

261
00:32:07,402 --> 00:32:09,441
All right...

262
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:16,775
For one thing, I'd like to know
if there's a good way of beating a bank.

263
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:19,581
Banks! What do you know about banks?

264
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:22,078
What the hell do <i>you</i> know about banks?

265
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:27,369
What's so funny?

266
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:28,750
- You.
- Me?

267
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:30,921
That's right.

268
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,131
A man can do
whatever he sets his mind to.

269
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:40,423
Now, me, I wanna walk in
and buy a white Cadillac convertible.

270
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,596
Actually walk in and buy it, cash.

271
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:12,792
You might set your mind to gettin' us a lift.

272
00:33:13,676 --> 00:33:16,796
This walkin' is tough on my bad leg.

273
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,093
This is the best time. Most State troopers
are having coffee now.

274
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:39,406
Hey! Hey! Hey!

275
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:51,999
That sure isn't any white Cadillac.

276
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:54,089
Beggars can't be choosy.

277
00:33:54,217 --> 00:33:57,218
You simple-minded sonofabitch.

278
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,219
Get in the back seat.

279
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:06,802
- There's a raccoon in here.
- Hell with that. Get in the back.

280
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:11,517
What's the matter with you?
I ain't got all day to wait on you. Come on.

281
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:22,487
I've been...
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.

282
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,194
I've been drivin' all over this country.

283
00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:28,582
This guy another friend of yours?

284
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,786
Slightly advanced, isn't he?

285
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:53,942
Hey, what's wrong with this wreck?
We're gettin' gassed back here.

286
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:07,950
This guy's a basket case.
He's got the exhaust pipe in here.

287
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:36,483
- He's not your run-of-the-mill basket case.
- This guy is definitely out to lunch.

288
00:35:47,205 --> 00:35:50,040
What the hell's the matter with you, boy?

289
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:58,085
Hey, you're good, man. Very good.

290
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,839
Glass head, like all these nuts.

291
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:07,009
I don't know what we're gonna do
with these rabbits.

292
00:36:07,142 --> 00:36:09,181
Get 'em out.

293
00:36:10,937 --> 00:36:12,977
I saw that. That was very good.

294
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:16,816
Where are we headed, man? I'm ready.

295
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:21,901
I don't know. Sometimes when there's
nothin' to do, it's best to keep movin'.

296
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,489
You smell somethin' up here?

297
00:36:26,661 --> 00:36:28,321
No.

298
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:30,910
- Smell that?
- I don't smell anything.

299
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,832
It smells like shit.

300
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:37,918
Ah...

301
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:40,254
- Raccoon shit.
- Raccoon shit.

302
00:36:41,092 --> 00:36:44,508
Hang your hand out the window
and let the rain get at it.

303
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,963
- Would you like...
- Get outta here!

304
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:49,470
Just remember not to pick your teeth.

305
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:53,351
Oh, God...

306
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:38,645
In small-town banks, they leave the
telephone off the hook in the vault at night

307
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:41,064
so the local operator can listen in.

308
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,405
People walk into these banks with paper
sacks, fill 'em with money and walk out.

309
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:51,026
Anybody can do it.

310
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:52,740
Bullshit.

311
00:37:59,462 --> 00:38:03,923
The newest bank vaults have walls
of reinforced concrete five feet thick,

312
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,802
backed by six inches of steel.

313
00:38:06,928 --> 00:38:09,597
The vault door is stainless steel-faced.

314
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:15,309
It's an inch and a half of cast steel,
another 12 inches of burn-resisting steel,

315
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:19,600
and another inch and a half
of open-hearthed steel.

316
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:21,772
Come here.

317
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:26,401
A vault door has 20 bolts,
each an inch in diameter.

318
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:29,152
Eight on each side,
two top and two bottom.

319
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:34,159
This holds the door into a 16-inch steel
jamb set in 18 inches of concrete.

320
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:39,081
It's crosshatched by steel bars
running both vertical and horizontal.

321
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:45,664
This door is precision-made so you can't
pour nitro between the door and the vault.

322
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,840
If that isn't enough,

323
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:51,419
there's microphones, electric eyes,

324
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:55,636
pressure-sensitive mats,
vibration detectors, tear gas,

325
00:38:55,769 --> 00:39:00,561
and even thermostats that detect
the slightest rise in temperature.

326
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,564
Still interested in banks?

327
00:39:02,692 --> 00:39:05,646
I knew you weren't a preacher.

328
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:08,982
Preaching isn't so bad. You get used to it.

329
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:14,026
You are what you do, so to speak.
At times I even forgot about the money.

330
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:16,783
What money?

331
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:22,374
Montana Armored.

332
00:39:23,755 --> 00:39:25,794
Montana Armored?

333
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:29,465
How did you get into the vault?

334
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:35,011
20mm canon with armour-piercing shells.
Wasn't too hard.

335
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:38,633
That was on the news.
That was a big deal.

336
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,687
What did they call that guy?
The Thunderbolt.

337
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:47,232
That's you.

338
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:49,692
You're the Thunderbolt.

339
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:51,981
Parson's luck.

340
00:39:52,117 --> 00:39:53,575
Oh, no!

341
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:55,741
Watch out for the dog shit.

342
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:02,784
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.
That sounds like somethin'.

343
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:05,588
You're forgetting I'm a lot older than you.

344
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:08,002
There are plenty of guys twice my age

345
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:10,209
who don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground.

346
00:40:10,343 --> 00:40:11,968
In for a penny, in for a pound.

347
00:40:12,095 --> 00:40:15,049
So, who were these guys
that are following us?

348
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:17,221
Oh...

349
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,221
The big dude's a war hero.

350
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:23,603
Name's Red Leary.
Saved my life once in Korea.

351
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:27,812
He was sent to prison in Illinois
later on for stabbing a woman.

352
00:40:27,944 --> 00:40:31,111
There he met an old-time bank robber,
Billy Lamb.

353
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:34,489
Lamb taught him how to break safes.

354
00:40:34,617 --> 00:40:37,654
Lamb was a real genius for organisation.

355
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:39,827
Thanks.

356
00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:46,577
When they got out, Lamb introduced him
to Dunlop, an electronics expert.

357
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:49,464
That's the guy you took care of
in the field.

358
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:53,794
- Wanna brew?
- Definitely.

359
00:40:53,928 --> 00:40:58,721
The little Orphan Annie-eyed
character's Eddie Goody.

360
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,388
He's a driver.
Harmless when he's alone.

361
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,726
So what happened to the money?

362
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:07,639
Hey, I don't care anything
about the money, you know that.

363
00:41:07,776 --> 00:41:10,267
We're friends. I like you as a friend.

364
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:12,443
Yeah.

365
00:41:14,532 --> 00:41:21,614
We hid it in a one-room schoolhouse
in Warsaw, a place Lamb went to as a kid.

366
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:26,873
Hid it in a wall behind the blackboard.
Half a million dollars worth. It's still there.

367
00:41:27,003 --> 00:41:29,541
- Schoolhouse?
- Behind the blackboard.

368
00:41:29,672 --> 00:41:31,712
Why?

369
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:36,886
It was always Lamb's practice
to control the money till the final split.

370
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:41,011
We kept in contact with each other
through personals in the paper.

371
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:45,187
Then Lamb had a heart attack and died.
Guess he was just too old for it.

372
00:41:45,313 --> 00:41:49,525
Leary got suspicious but I didn't
tell him where the money was because

373
00:41:49,651 --> 00:41:52,486
I knew he'd go straight to it,
heat or no heat.

374
00:41:55,323 --> 00:42:01,029
Then the police released a thing in the
press saying the money had been found.

375
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:02,277
Bullshit.

376
00:42:02,413 --> 00:42:04,287
Leary went off his ass.

377
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:08,625
He got careless
but couldn't lead them to the money

378
00:42:08,753 --> 00:42:10,793
cos he didn't know where it was.

379
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:17,962
Finally, they convicted him on another
bank robbery that took place years before.

380
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:22,259
And when he got out
he convinced the others I'd set him up.

381
00:42:22,392 --> 00:42:25,642
I decided
best that I should drop out for a while.

382
00:42:28,273 --> 00:42:30,645
That church was a pretty far-out idea.

383
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:34,569
About as far out as possible, I thought.

384
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,779
Are you sure this is the spot?

385
00:43:22,076 --> 00:43:23,156
Yeah.

386
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:27,118
- What? I didn't hear what you said.
- I said, yeah, this is it.

387
00:43:30,794 --> 00:43:32,833
Well, what happened to it?

388
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:35,836
I don't know. Progress.

389
00:44:07,205 --> 00:44:09,244
Have a nice day, boy.

390
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:13,284
Here, for you.

391
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:15,459
That's the last of our money.

392
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:20,510
It's good. Real good.

393
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,119
Fantastic pistachio.

394
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,833
What do we do now?

395
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,533
Drop your cocks
and reach for your socks.

396
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:01,217
Don't look at me. I didn't say a word.

397
00:45:01,342 --> 00:45:03,382
- Red?
- Start the car.

398
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:08,885
Freeze, you sonofabitch.
The first one of you moves, I shoot.

399
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:49,008
All right, kill the engine.
Hand me the keys and don't turn around.

400
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:53,931
Both of you get out Pistachio's side.

401
00:45:54,062 --> 00:45:58,273
No ideas - you'll both be dead
before you hit the ground.

402
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,313
Move it.

403
00:46:12,122 --> 00:46:13,699
Turn around.

404
00:46:16,084 --> 00:46:18,539
The guys in the car.

405
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,709
That's it, smartass.

406
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,749
Red. Goody.

407
00:46:24,717 --> 00:46:28,051
- How's Dunlop?
- That's for us to know and you to find out.

408
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:30,006
Shut up, Goody.

409
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:35,720
- What do you want, Red?
- What do I want?

410
00:46:35,854 --> 00:46:40,017
You got balls, I'll say that for you, Johnny.
I want your ass, my friend.

411
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:43,269
Hey, flattery's not gonna
get you guys anywhere.

412
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:47,488
- Who's the comedian?
- Name's Lightfoot.

413
00:46:47,615 --> 00:46:48,813
Does he know everything?

414
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,409
- No.
- Yeah.

415
00:46:54,747 --> 00:46:56,954
Lightfoot, huh?

416
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:57,997
Yeah.

417
00:47:06,926 --> 00:47:10,011
Good thing I didn't hit him in the face.
He'd be dead now.

418
00:47:10,138 --> 00:47:13,139
You always had a high opinion
of yourself, Red.

419
00:47:13,266 --> 00:47:15,757
What you been preachin' lately, Johnny?

420
00:47:15,894 --> 00:47:17,933
Survival.

421
00:47:20,482 --> 00:47:21,762
Are you ready?

422
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,939
I've been countin' the days.

423
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:36,113
That's for the kid.

424
00:47:36,247 --> 00:47:40,708
- You wanna talk or play games?
- What do you want me to do, Red?

425
00:47:41,211 --> 00:47:43,250
Shut your face.

426
00:48:01,648 --> 00:48:03,854
I can't breathe! I got asthma.

427
00:48:06,152 --> 00:48:08,275
What do you want me to do now, Red?

428
00:48:08,404 --> 00:48:10,397
Kill the sonofabitch.

429
00:48:10,532 --> 00:48:12,109
Here?

430
00:48:12,242 --> 00:48:13,700
Yes.

431
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:14,692
Now?

432
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:16,449
Now!

433
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:21,908
Don't ever point a gun at me.
Understand? Not even a twig.

434
00:48:23,002 --> 00:48:24,165
You got it.

435
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:26,418
You come from hitters, don't you?

436
00:48:31,302 --> 00:48:35,632
What are you waitin' for? Why don't you
kill me? I woulda killed you.

437
00:48:44,149 --> 00:48:47,897
That doesn't make up for two years.
I'm gonna kill you anyway.

438
00:48:48,027 --> 00:48:50,518
The money was here - in the schoolhouse.

439
00:48:53,158 --> 00:48:56,194
What's this garbage talking about?

440
00:48:56,327 --> 00:48:58,997
The money was never recovered.

441
00:48:59,998 --> 00:49:04,576
TV, radio, papers, everybody was lying.
They were working with the police.

442
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:09,254
When Lamb died I never came back here.
The money's still here. It's safe.

443
00:49:09,382 --> 00:49:11,173
Here?

444
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:16,176
Yeah. Lamb went to school here in
Warsaw, a little one-room schoolhouse.

445
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:19,223
We put the money in the wall,
behind the blackboard.

446
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,387
Where's this one-room schoolhouse?

447
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,098
Gone.

448
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,270
Gone? Gone where?

449
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:32,852
I wish I knew. Used to be right
where the new schoolhouse is now.

450
00:49:32,989 --> 00:49:35,860
You expect me to believe all this crap?

451
00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:41,073
It's the truth. Why do you think
I'd come to a dumb town like this?

452
00:49:41,206 --> 00:49:44,871
How the hell do I know?
You're queer for dumb towns.

453
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:47,290
Half a million dollars don't disappear.

454
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,540
They shoulda found something
when they tore the place down.

455
00:49:50,673 --> 00:49:52,713
I wish I had the answer for you.

456
00:49:56,805 --> 00:49:59,378
The sad part is that we got away with it.

457
00:50:00,975 --> 00:50:03,015
It's a sin, that's what it is.

458
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:06,143
Christ, it's a sin.

459
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:10,235
Oh, boy, I feel old.

460
00:50:12,153 --> 00:50:14,395
What are we gonna do now, Red?

461
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:16,570
Shut up, Goody.

462
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,660
I got hay fever too.

463
00:50:36,302 --> 00:50:39,588
- Why not do it again?
- What's he mouthin' off about?

464
00:50:39,722 --> 00:50:42,842
Montana Armored.
We hit the same place, the same way.

465
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:45,015
Montana Armored?

466
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:51,313
What?

467
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:55,977
Hey, they'd never expect it.
Not something that big.

468
00:50:56,114 --> 00:50:58,984
It's never been done before, has it?

469
00:50:59,117 --> 00:51:02,367
That'd really be something, wouldn't it?

470
00:51:02,495 --> 00:51:04,535
Yeah, it sure would.

471
00:51:05,373 --> 00:51:07,449
Hey, I think that's a great idea.

472
00:51:07,584 --> 00:51:11,000
Let's not get queer over it.
What does the kid know anyway?

473
00:51:11,129 --> 00:51:13,999
Besides the Lamb is dead
and he wrecked Dunlop.

474
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:18,509
You don't need the Lamb. We do it
the same way. You already did it once.

475
00:51:19,637 --> 00:51:21,215
You might have something.

476
00:51:21,347 --> 00:51:25,890
The blind leading the blind.
He's a kid. He eats pistachio ice cream.

477
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:30,681
Jesus, you can lead a mule to water
but you can't make him drink it.

478
00:51:30,815 --> 00:51:33,223
That's a horse, not a mule.

479
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,984
I agree.

480
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,151
- Agree with what?
- With him.

481
00:51:38,156 --> 00:51:40,149
Good grief.

482
00:51:40,283 --> 00:51:44,660
Even if I did agree, what would we use
as a stake to operate with?

483
00:51:44,788 --> 00:51:48,157
Well, we could all get jobs for a while.

484
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:54,293
You're better at asking questions
than you are at answering them.

485
00:51:56,132 --> 00:52:01,506
And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb and
the leopard shall lie down with the kid.

486
00:52:03,431 --> 00:52:04,925
What's that? A poem?

487
00:52:06,643 --> 00:52:08,552
No, it's a prayer.

488
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,359
200 is 200 for the pot.

489
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:02,948
200?

490
00:53:03,074 --> 00:53:08,413
Better than that piece of junk running out
on the highway. We got Goody's car still.

491
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:16,825
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

492
00:53:18,006 --> 00:53:20,757
Where do you pick up
these pearis of wisdom?

493
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:22,259
Books.

494
00:53:22,385 --> 00:53:25,172
You mean you can actually read?

495
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,848
- I read <i>you</i> loud and clear.
- You better believe it.

496
00:53:28,975 --> 00:53:34,314
That's enough. We gotta keep it together.
If you can't manage that, I walk.

497
00:53:34,439 --> 00:53:37,440
I'd like to hit him again
just for the hell of it.

498
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,761
Well, there it is.

499
00:54:15,897 --> 00:54:17,937
That's it?

500
00:54:18,817 --> 00:54:21,058
Sure doesn't look like much, does it?

501
00:54:21,194 --> 00:54:24,895
Doesn't look like much?
You dopey sonofabitch.

502
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:34,664
- Simple-minded sonofabitch.
- What did you get in my way for?

503
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:42,211
Love this guy.

504
00:54:52,434 --> 00:54:55,553
We're gonna be great friends, Red.

505
00:55:24,716 --> 00:55:27,800
You forgot to give me
your Social Security number.

506
00:55:29,262 --> 00:55:29,878
What?

507
00:55:30,013 --> 00:55:34,473
I said that you forgot to give me
your Social Security number.

508
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:36,640
Oh, I've forgotten it.

509
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:38,228
Forgotten it?

510
00:55:38,354 --> 00:55:40,181
Ha-ha!

511
00:55:40,315 --> 00:55:44,182
Nobody ever forgets their number.
Where you been workin'?

512
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,726
Uh, listen, I'm gonna need it for these.

513
00:55:46,863 --> 00:55:50,528
So if you can bring it to me tomorrow
I'd appreciate it.

514
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:52,153
Hey.

515
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:54,693
Do you live near here?

516
00:56:01,544 --> 00:56:06,087
Man, I'm goin' crazy. That drives me wild.
She just does somethin' to me.

517
00:56:51,302 --> 00:56:54,506
- Why did you leave?
- I couldn't wear that stuff.

518
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:57,130
Too humiliating. And you look ridiculous.

519
00:56:57,267 --> 00:56:58,465
What's this?

520
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:00,511
That's my route.

521
00:57:00,645 --> 00:57:04,809
Just follow the streets
and it takes you right back to the garage.

522
00:57:06,609 --> 00:57:10,856
If you don't mind my saying,
I think you should get a job.

523
00:57:10,989 --> 00:57:14,322
- Nobody asked you.
- All right, all right.

524
00:57:14,451 --> 00:57:17,985
- Read me the first street.
- Left on 12th Avenue South to 9th Street,

525
00:57:18,121 --> 00:57:21,490
- right on North 3rd to the viaduct...
- One at a time!

526
00:57:21,624 --> 00:57:23,664
Left on 12th Avenue South.
