00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,700
This is a multimillion-dollar
piece of machinery.

512
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,000
We have to fly in a crew
from L.A. Just to take a look at it.

513
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,700
Okay. How long is that gonna take?

514
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,500
Lt'll take a couple of hours
before they even get here.

515
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,500
That's great.

516
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
[Sighs]

517
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,500
[Door closing]

518
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,300
[Door opening and closing]

519
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,200
HENDERSON: I just got phone calls
from editors of two major newspapers...

520
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,900
asking me if I had any comment
on my slot machine play.

521
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,300
HENDERSON: They both claim to have
photos and video of me.

522
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,300
What the hell's going on, Ed?

523
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,500
HENDERSON: Do you know what
this will do to me? To my career?

524
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
I have a pretty good idea.

525
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,500
HENDERSON: I don't care
what you have to do! You stop this!

526
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,200
But I can't.

527
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,200
And more importantly, I won't.

528
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,200
What do you mean, you won't?

529
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,700
It's over.

530
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,900
You'll be lucky if they let you
pick up trash in the parking lot...

531
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,700
when I'm through with you.

532
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,900
HENDERSON: I will destroy you, Ed!

533
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Well, I guess we'll just have to go down
together then, buddy?

534
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,200
My marker for my silence then.

535
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,100
Excuse me?

536
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,100
You tear up my $3.5 million marker...

537
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,500
and my losses from this weekend,
and I won't talk.

538
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,100
So, let's see.

539
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,500
[Ed clears throat]

540
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,000
- I tear up your marker...
- Deal?

541
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,000
Screw you.

542
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,100
Well, I'm taking you down with me, Ed.

543
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,600
All I did was a little gambling, but you...

544
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,100
You do what you gotta do, Bill.

545
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
Get me my car and my plane. I'm leaving.

546
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,700
You're leaving...

547
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,100
but see, this time,
you're gonna go out the front door.

548
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
That's an outrage. L...

549
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna call a valet...

550
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,000
and he's gonna put you in a real nice cab.

551
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,800
ED: I'm gonna take you to the airport and
put you on a real big commercial airline.

552
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,100
Look at this.

553
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,200
Damn it. You missed the last flight.

554
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,400
I guess you'll have to leave
first thing in the morning.

555
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,200
Check out is 11:00 a.m., sharp.

556
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,900
ANCHORPERSON: This just in.
Sen. Bill Henderson was spotted gambling...

557
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,200
in a Las Vegas casino.

558
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,100
MARY: Please, God, this can't be happening.

559
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,000
ARDEN: A damsel in distress.

560
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,400
MAN: Come on!

561
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,700
MARY: I can't believe this is happening.

562
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,600
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.

563
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,700
I'll be lucky if they let me finish the day.

564
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,500
[Crowd whooping]

565
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
MAN: Check it out!

566
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,200
ARDEN: Excalibur, I call upon your power!

567
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,500
[Crowd cheering]

568
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,600
DANNY: He's not coming up.
MARY: You better get him, Danny.

569
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,200
Go out there.

570
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,100
[Crowd applauding and cheering]

571
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,500
[Upbeat instrumental music]

572
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,100
Watch this.

573
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,800
[Cheering and applauding continues]

574
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,200
ARDEN: Long live Camelot!

575
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,100
[Upbeat instrumental music continues]

576
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,000
[Laughing]

577
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,100
ANCHORPERSON 1: Sen. Bill Henderson,
the nation's self-appointed...

578
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,000
defender of virtues and morals,
was caught last night...

579
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,900
with his hand in the proverbial cookie jar.

580
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,200
Complaining for years
that the liberal left was taking this country...

581
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,600
down the toilet...

582
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,700
it would appear the senior senator
was actually leading the way.

583
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,400
ANCHORPERSON 2: There were also reports
that Wild Bill, when not at the tables...

584
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,200
was a regular at Girls, Girls, Girls,
a local Las Vegas strip club.

585
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,600
So I guess it's safe to say that he was
just getting a feel for his constituents.

586
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,200
Maybe we should send the senator
a copy of his...

587
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,700
Did you all enjoy your stay?

588
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,700
It was the best vacation ever.

589
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,000
We even pulled
an all-nighter last night. Honey?

590
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,500
[Laughs]

591
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,400
We haven't done that since we were kids.

592
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,400
We even got a picture of us and King Arthur
in front of the big pyramid.

593
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,700
With his horse. His horse is right...

594
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,500
SUSIE: Isn't that Senator Henderson?

595
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,500
I told you everybody comes to Vegas.

596
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,600
So, what do you suppose the odds are
he won't talk?

597
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,500
ED: Who cares? I'm not the news, he is.

598
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
[Sentimental music]

599
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
[People chattering]

600
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,000
Thanks.

601
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,700
Danny, I'm so sorry about your friend.

602
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,500
Thank you.

603
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,200
If there's anything Ed and I can do,
just don't hesitate to ask.

604
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,700
My condolences, Danny.

605
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,200
Everybody, to Greg.

606
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,200
ALL: To Greg.

607
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,900
Viva Las Vegas!

608
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
ALL: Viva Las Vegas!

609
