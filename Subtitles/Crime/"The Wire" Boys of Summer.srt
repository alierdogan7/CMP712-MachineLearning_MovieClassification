1
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,850
<i>Anybody in plumbing,
please go to aisle 4.</i>

2
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,850
God... damn.

3
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,750
I see you got the Dewalt cordless.

4
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,250
Nailgun, Dewalt 410.

5
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,949
Yeah. The trouble is,
you leave it in a truck for a while,

6
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,750
need to step up and use the bitch,
the battery don't hold up, you know?

7
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,650
Yeah, cordless'll do that.

8
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,450
You might want to consider
the powder-actuated tool.

9
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,550
The Hilti DX 460 MX
or the Simpson PTP...

10
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,350
These two are my Cadillacs.

11
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,050
Everything else on this board
is second best, sorry to say.

12
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,050
Are you contracting, or just doing
some work around the house?

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,750
No, we work all over.

14
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,150
Full time?

15
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,150
No, we had about 5 jobs last month.

16
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,350
With that rate, the cost of the
powder-actuated guns justifies itself.

17
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,850
- You say "power"?
- Powder.

18
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,550
- Like gunpowder?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,750
The DX 460 is fully automatic,
with a .27 caliber charge.

20
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,450
Wood, concrete, steel to steel...

21
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,249
She'll throw a fastener
into anything,

22
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,049
and for my money, she handles recoil
better than the Simpson or the P3500.

23
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,849
Now, you understand
what I mean by recoil?

24
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,950
- Yeah, the kickback. I'm with you.
- That's right.

25
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,950
.27 caliber?

26
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,050
Yeah, not large ballistically,
but for driving nails, it's enough.

27
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,250
Any more than that,
you'd add to the recoil.

28
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,649
Man, shit.

29
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,750
I seen a tiny-ass .22 round-nose
strap a nigger plenty of days, man.

30
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,550
Motherfuckers get up in you
like a pinball,

31
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,950
rip your ass up.
Big joints, though...

32
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,450
Big joints, man,
just break your bones,

33
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,850
you say, "fuck it."

34
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,950
I'm gonna go with this
right here, man.

35
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,550
How much do I owe you?

36
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,250
669 plus tax.

37
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,150
No, no, you just pay
at the register.

38
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,850
Nah, man, you go ahead
and handle that for me, man.

39
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,649
And keep the rest for your time.

40
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,250
This is $800.

41
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,449
So what, man?

42
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,349
You earned that buck
like a motherfucker, man.

43
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,250
Keep that shit.

44
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,549
- We good?
- Yeah, man.

45
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,350
The man said if you
want to shoot nails,

46
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,450
this here is the Cadillac, man.

47
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,550
He mean Lexus,
but he ain't know it.

48
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,049
- Hold the charge better?
- Man, fuck the charge.

49
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,750
This here is gunpowder-activated,
.27 caliber,

50
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,150
full auto, no kickback,
nail-throwing mayhem, man.

51
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,850
Shit right here is tight.

52
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,549
Fuck just nailing up boards.

53
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,150
We could kill a couple motherfuckers
with this right here.

54
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,338
You laughing.

55
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:35,349
I've been schooled, dog.
I'm trying to tell you.

56
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,050
- All right, all right.
- For real.

57
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,950
Season 4 - Episode 1
"Boys of Summer"

58
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,450
7 and counting.

59
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,750
All of them caught on the wire.

60
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,250
We're not above the corners yet,
but we soon will be.

61
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,950
- They're not dumping phones?
- Every month or so.

62
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,449
Sloppy enough that we may
be able to track a phone or two

63
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,450
up to Marlo or the people
he keeps close.

64
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,450
Truth is, if they're still using
cellphones in this day and age,

65
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,650
they're mine.

66
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,750
And if Marlo Stanfield is on a cell,
he'll be mine, too.

67
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,250
Cool Lester smooth.

68
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,950
That's not trash talk,
darling, that's simple fact.

69
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,250
Marlo Stanfield may have a lot
of heart and a lot of corners,

70
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,450
but he's a babe in the woods
when it comes to this right here.

71
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,550
I was proud to be chasing
those Barksdales,

72
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,450
- but this Stanfield kid...
- Not as fierce as we thought.

73
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,350
For months now, there hasn't been
a body we can put to him.

74
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,950
You two sound disappointed.

75
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,050
This unit needs good, hard targets,
or it'll go soft.

76
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,249
Be that as it may, I'll assume
you want another 30 days on your taps.

77
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,249
At least.

78
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,450
And we got subpoenas
to go out this week as well.

79
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,450
- Subpoenas?
- Asset investigations.

80
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,450
- On Marlo Stanfield?
- Come here.

81
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,450
All this is from the Barksdale
money trail.

82
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,149
We've been running down all the paper
we pulled out of Stringer's apartment

83
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,450
and the B&B office downtown.

84
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,150
I miss Prez, man.

85
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,350
- I do.
- I hear you.

86
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,150
The truth is, those guys
had money going everywhere...

87
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,250
Investments, political donations,
consulting fees...

88
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,950
- You want to do this now?
- I wanted to do this a year ago,

89
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,350
but fresh cases got in the way.

90
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,950
And your lieutenant's gonna OK
this kind of paper?

91
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,550
Our lieutenant has a fearless heart.

92
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,750
This will get you started.

93
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,449
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait right there.

94
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,050
My coupons.

95
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,950
You were gonna
give this lady my coupons.

96
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,350
Been clipping them for two days,

97
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,449
and you damn near
sent them out with your mess.

98
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,449
- Well, why are they in my pile?
- Why is your pile in my workspace?

99
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,849
Because I'm doing real work!

100
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,150
Working my nerves
is what you been doing.

101
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,049
4 weeks before
the Baltimore City primary,

102
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,350
you hand me a stack
of drug money subpoenas

103
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,050
that hit a dozen
key political figures.

104
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,050
There's an election?

105
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,250
Who's running?

106
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,050
And I think I can.

107
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,050
Shit, I don't think we can take
4 more years of this guy.

108
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,650
This city's in the toilet.

109
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,249
That's what they said
during my term, too.

110
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,149
Yeah, well, you got dealt a bad hand,
I mean, with the riots and all.

111
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,449
- Yeah, sure.
- Anyway, I think I squeeze in

112
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,149
if Tony Gray draws off
25%, 26% of the vote,

113
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,950
because most of that's
out of Royce's base.

114
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,650
25% is a big number for Gray,
don't you think?

115
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,850
I don't know.
Royce's negatives are up...

116
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,750
Even among black voters.

117
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,850
Yeah. In a minute, Norman.

118
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,750
You know what I think, Tommy?

119
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,050
No matter what,
you got your name out there,

120
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,649
and it'll help you down the road

121
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,050
if you ever want to step up
to the legislature.

122
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,150
But as one paisan to another,

123
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,150
the day of the white mayor
is over in this town.

124
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,850
Excuse me, your eminence.

125
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,850
You're due at the Baylor-Edison
senior center,

126
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,649
and I don't want to be lying
to a roomful of wrinkle-assed voters

127
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,850
because you wanted to talk shop
all the damn morning.

128
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,149
Seniors?
They vote, Tommy.

129
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,650
Got to run. Sorry.

130
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,850
The candidate's on your clock.
Don't ever let him forget it.

131
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,150
No, indeed.

132
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,850
Need your sig on vehicle logs

133
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,550
and a corrected court report

134
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:52,550
and office memo subpoena requests

135
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,250
and a requisition to city
purchasing for a large fan.

136
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,050
A fan?

137
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,149
Caroline says it stays
hot in the wire room

138
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,150
with the door closed.

139
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,350
It's beautiful, lieutenant.
I never seen a beach house so fine.

140
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,449
You think so?

141
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,650
Shit. Makes me think about retirement,
and I only got 9 years on.

142
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,950
- When do you break ground?
- Next march, if I have my permits...

143
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,849
Which reminds me,
on Tuesday,

144
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,146
I have to get over to Delaware
and see my contractor.

145
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,150
Oh, no problem.

146
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,150
Me and Lester,
we'll cover for you on that.

147
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,750
No problem at all.

148
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,050
Cake.

149
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,250
You know what I'm saying, yo?

150
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,550
That's my baby's mother
we talking about, yo.

151
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,150
But y'all been broke up, right?

152
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,249
Man, I ain't living with her
or nothing,

153
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,650
but I still be giving her
a couple dollars here and there,

154
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,249
you know, stop and pass.

155
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,850
<i>Pandemic! Pandemic!</i>

156
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,550
Look at this.

157
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,550
Hey, Nay.

158
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,450
Namond!

159
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,350
What the fuck am I
paying you for, nigger?

160
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,350
Oh, my fault, B.

161
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,850
Damn.

162
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,150
Yo, man, and do something
with that ponytail.

163
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,050
Cops can make his ass
from a mile away.

164
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,650
Braid it or something!

165
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,150
Yeah, you know, me and Patrice
been together for a long time.

166
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,450
Yeah, but you say she running
with the boy Fruit now, right?

167
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,650
If he don't back the fuck off,

168
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,150
I'm gonna fill his ass
with some hot ones, yo.

169
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,850
Shit. You don't think I will?

170
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,150
<i>I got that Pandemic.</i>

171
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,750
Man...

172
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,250
do what you gonna do.

173
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,950
- Bodie.
- What's up, big man?

174
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,250
You ain't real with us
all week, man.

175
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,649
You stepping on that package
or what?

176
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,150
Yo, man, everything's slow.

177
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,850
It been slow since we moved
down here from Fayette Street.

178
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,250
Yeah, well, Marlo wanted Fayette.

179
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,650
Man, I do not like backing down
from niggers, man.

180
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,950
I feel like a punk.
I feel like doing shit.

181
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,750
Ain't like the old days, dog.
Mayor Barksdale left.

182
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,550
You out here on your own, dog.

183
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,550
Give it up.

184
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,950
B., let's roll.

185
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,850
Hey, Lex, man,

186
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,850
I'm gonna give you the truth
because you need the truth.

187
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,950
That boy Marlo
got the world by the ass,

188
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,049
and Fruit, he work for Marlo.

189
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,250
So I'm saying, fuck that bitch.

190
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,150
And move on.

191
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,450
That's just the way it is.

192
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,950
That's just the way it is, man.

193
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,450
<i>Pandemic!</i>

194
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,850
Thank you, sir.

195
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,950
Just one moment, ma'am.

196
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,950
- You seen Hoskins?
- Lieutenant went upstairs already.

197
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,950
<i>Step through, please.</i>

198
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,750
Madam President.

199
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,150
Council President's hot as balls.

200
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,150
I'd fuck you to fuck her, man.

201
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,450
Yeah?

202
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,050
You'd fuck a guy for a chance
to fuck a hot broad?

203
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,250
You don't think that makes you
a faggot or nothing?

204
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,950
It's just an expression, man.

205
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,850
Been on this detail how long?

206
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,650
- 8 months.
- 8 months with Clarence Royce.

207
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,550
So let me ask,

208
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,750
are you ready to take a bullet
for the mayor of Baltimore?

209
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,150
Lieutenant, sir.

210
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,250
Is the truck OK,
or do we want to call one?

211
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:38,450
Nah, the truck works.

212
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,550
He said he needed just 10 minutes.

213
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,850
No, not now.

214
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,550
Maybe tomorrow?

215
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,050
Is that Krawczyk again?

216
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,950
Every time
he writes another check,

217
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,850
he turns around
and calls for something

218
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,050
just to see that he can.

219
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,150
Getting calls from
Carcetti's people, too.

220
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,649
They want one debate
for crime and safety,

221
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,650
the other on economic stuff
and schools.

222
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,550
Tony Gray crying the same blues.

223
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,350
Like they're gonna
get the whole night

224
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,749
to smack me with the crime rate.

225
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,750
I told the "Sun" paper
we're open to any format,

226
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,749
which we'll be for another
couple days or so,

227
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,150
in which time we'll say,
"Fuck you. One debate."

228
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,750
Two debates. Shit!

229
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,750
That lost-ball-in-high-grass
motherfucker Carcetti.

230
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,250
He needs to get used to life
in the wilderness.

231
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,549
And not just the downtown areas,

232
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,250
but your communities
here on the east side.

233
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,350
We stand or we fall together,

234
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,950
and I'm here today to ask for
the chance to stand with you.

235
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,150
Thank you for your time.

236
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,750
Questions?

237
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,850
Yes, ma'am?

238
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,850
Is it the Salisbury steak
for lunch today,

239
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,950
or is they doing tacos?

240
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,550
Because it's developments
like this one,

241
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,650
planned residential towers,

242
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:09,653
with waterside retail space
and restaurants,

243
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,050
that grow Baltimore's tax base
and help rebuild our city.

244
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,950
I want to thank Ed Bowers
for his vision,

245
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,150
but more important,
for his commitment.

246
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,050
For his commitment
to the city of Baltimore.

247
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,450
Ed.

248
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,150
Mr. Mayor,

249
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,649
I want to thank you
and your administration

250
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,550
For making this next stage of
redevelopment for Baltimore's harbor

251
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,950
a reality.

252
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,550
You talk about vision
and commitment...

253
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,650
Mayor Clarence Royce.

254
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,850
<i>Pandemic! Pandemic!</i>

255
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,450
What up, Nay?

256
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,250
Yo, what up?

257
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,250
What you got?

258
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,350
Nothing. It's just a story about
A.J. from North and Woods.

259
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,450
Yo, you know they gave him
700 years?

260
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,550
Read this shit, son.

261
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,750
This corner is dead, man.

262
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,949
You still working?

263
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,049
Yeah, because we was gonna
gonna go under the road

264
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,150
and catch some fresh birds.

265
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,250
I don't know.

266
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,250
Let me see if I can bounce.
Hold up.

267
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,649
- Hey, B.
- What's up?

268
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,349
I wanted to know
if I could leave early

269
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,350
because me and the fellas
want to go down to [?]

270
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,651
for some back-to-school stuff.

271
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:44,350
What you need
back-to-school stuff for?

272
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,150
- Your ass stay suspended.
- Come on, stop playing, B.

273
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,949
Hey, if it wasn't
for social promotion,

274
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,450
your ass would still be
in pre-k, motherfucker.

275
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,750
Probably day care up this bitch.

276
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,450
<i>Pandemic right here!</i>

277
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,850
Fuck it. Hey, yo, man.

278
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,849
Pay this late-to-work,

279
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,750
early-to-play nigger out
for 5 hours, yo.

280
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,350
Yo, you owe me extra time
tomorrow, though.

281
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,850
Lex! Did you hear me?

282
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,050
Damn, y'all!

283
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,950
Young'uns don't got a scrap
of work ethic nowadays, man.

284
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,250
If it wasn't for his pops,
I wouldn't even bother.

285
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,450
Yo!

286
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,949
Make sure you come early tomorrow

287
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,350
because it ain't always
gonna be this slow.

288
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,950
<i>Pandemic!</i>

289
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,450
At least I hope it ain't.

290
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,750
Mr. Mayor.
Mr. Mayor, excuse me.

291
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,349
I just want to make sure
we're still OK

292
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,750
for that median cut
on Boston Street.

293
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,550
I really need that access
to make the site viable.

294
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,750
Right. I'll get my people on it.

295
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,150
Thank you, sir.

296
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,950
Something going on
with his median?

297
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,550
Not once he ponies up.

298
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,750
I think he can do a lot better
than the 4,000.

299
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,350
Don't you?

300
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,250
I don't even want to know.

301
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,450
No, Chris, please, man.

302
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,350
[?]

303
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,350
Doesn't matter.

304
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,250
We got vacants on both sides.
He'll stink is all.

305
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,050
Chris, please.

306
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,050
Don't fret, boss.
I got you covered.

307
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,650
Quick and clean, I promise.

308
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,350
Man, shit like that don't even
work in them cartoons.

309
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,950
The roadrunner just snatched
the birdseed and booked.

310
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,550
We ain't in no cartoon.

311
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,450
- Yeah, you is.
- Be still.

312
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,049
Yeah, you scaring away the birds.

313
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,450
I'm talking to both y'all.

314
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,949
Took me off the clock
for this craziness?

315
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,249
What the fuck is you thinking?

316
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,349
We're serious, Nay.

317
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,249
This bird could be worth,
like, 300 or 400.

318
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,350
Nigger, please.

319
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,050
Yo, you know the boy Nemo
who worked Marlo's pigeon coop?

320
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,249
Said he got 400
for a white homing bird.

321
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,650
- And that's a homer?
- I mean, it's white.

322
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,350
- So that makes it a homer, right?
- Might could be.

323
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,813
Damn! Son, you need to put some
hamburger meat in that trap.

324
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,949
That shit would've been got.

325
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,950
Shut your mouth,
it'd have been got.

326
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,750
The fuck is wrong with you,
throwing bottles and shit?

327
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,649
You just cost us cash money.
You know that?

328
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,350
- Yo, I ain't done nothing.
- You're a seriously backwards dude,

329
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,349
you know that, right?

330
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,450
Playing with bugs
like he's still in pampers.

331
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,650
- That wasn't even necessary.
- Nah, you don't want any pampers.

332
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,654
Put them over that mouth you got.
Catch all that shit you be flushing.

333
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,050
Y'all be stinking like rat fart.

334
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,450
<i>There you go!</i>

335
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,350
All right, all right.
Come on, come on, come on. Come on.

336
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,949
Y'all acting like little bitches.

337
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,250
Yo, you seen my man Duke?

338
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,050
Clocked him, got him
upside his head.

339
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,950
Only because I didn't want
to get too close

340
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,450
and touch the dirty motherfucker.

341
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,661
Could have come up with aids
or some shit like that.

342
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:53,947
Dukie fight like a bitch, yo.

343
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,850
Duke, man, you scared away the birds.

344
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,749
I blew me up a bug bomb.
You want to come and see the pieces?

345
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,550
Nah, I'm good. I got to go.

346
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,250
All right.

347
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,450
Hey, hey, Randy.

348
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,650
That pigeon wasn't a homer.

349
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,050
You know, homers got the metal
things around their leg.

350
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,250
That way, you can tell them
from the other birds.

351
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,349
How you know that?

352
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,550
You know Nemo let me
clean out his coop sometimes.

353
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,550
So... he was schooling me.

354
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,449
Which leaves us a total of 54.

355
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,150
No surprises on who's coming back...
all the regulars.

356
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,250
We lost Mr. Parker
and Ms. Bowles.

357
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,850
- Griffey's leaving?
- Hired by the county.

358
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,749
And Bowles, I knew she wasn't
coming back,

359
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,550
the way they tore up
her classroom.

360
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,950
So we're short two in math
and 4 in science.

361
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,049
Man at the door.

362
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,050
No system I.D.,
but says he's new here.

363
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,950
Well, buzz him in before
something changes his mind.

364
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,550
All the way on the left.

365
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,150
Pull it hard.

366
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,750
<i>Hard!</i>

367
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,650
<i>- It's locked.
- All right. I'll be right down.</i>

368
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,850
Not a goddamn thing up in here
works like it should.

369
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,049
Well, you turn to
the cafeteria assignments,

370
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,580
and you see that's gonna leave
Ernest alone for second period,

371
00:23:24,674 --> 00:23:26,251
and he can't handle it alone.

372
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,650
You tell them,

373
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,950
because I ain't even gonna try
to pronounce it.

374
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,650
Roland Pryzbylewski.

375
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,850
Everyone just calls me "Prez."

376
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,850
Woodrow Willis.
I'm principal here.

377
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,450
New in math.

378
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,650
I won't have my certificate
until next year,

379
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,749
but with the resident
teachers program,

380
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,650
they said I'd be getting classes?

381
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,949
Because of staff shortages?

382
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,750
Jesus. Lambs to the slaughter here.

383
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,250
What did you do before you decided
to teach, Mr. Pryzbylewski?

384
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,550
I was a police... in the city.

385
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,550
Marcia Donnelly,
assistant principal.

386
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,850
Welcome to
Edward Tilghman Middle.

387
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,950
That leaves Tullman
as [?] for the 12th.

388
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,049
You think he can handle
the whole shift?

389
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,450
Now, which one's Tullman, again?

390
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,050
Goofy redhead, kind of looks
like Opie from Mayberry,

391
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,550
but less fierce.

392
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,150
Jimmy, major wants to see you.

393
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,650
Jimmy, come on in.

394
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,950
I know I offered
when I first came over here,

395
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,550
and I know your answer then,
but I'm still asking.

396
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,649
Can I get you out of a radio car?

397
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,850
- No thank you, Major.

398
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,050
McNulty, I'm short two men in ops,

399
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,150
and my follow-up squad couldn't
make a case to save its life.

400
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,450
You're too damn good
to be humping calls.

401
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,150
Thanks for the offer, though.

402
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,950
You don't think I asked him 10 times
when I was acting commander?

403
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,850
He's in the wrong fucking place.

404
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,550
For us, yeah.

405
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,750
For him...

406
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,250
Yo, po-po, man.
Po-po. Shut it down.

407
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,749
Where is the love, Bodie?

408
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,050
Where is the motherfucking love?

409
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,950
I go back so far with this kid,
I was chasing him through juvie.

410
00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:31,050
But does any of that matter
when we roll up here?

411
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,050
I get so much as a wave,
a nod, a smile?

412
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,050
Nothing?

413
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,650
How about just "hello"?

414
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,350
- Hello.
- See?

415
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,350
That wasn't so hard, was it?

416
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,050
Lex, my man,
how's your day going?

417
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,450
Not to criticize or anything,

418
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,550
but I think you missed
a spot there.

419
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,050
Little Kevin, how's it hanging?

420
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,220
Reesey, you look like someone
just shot your dog.

421
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:56,051
You all right, man? You OK?

422
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,650
Reesey still messing up the count?

423
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,749
<i>You hear what he said?</i>

424
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,849
Yo, dog, you send him up
to Lamelle next month,

425
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,050
I'll make sure Ms. Davis
puts him in remedial math,

426
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,850
and we'll have done
some good here today.

427
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,350
Fucking cop, man.

428
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,450
- Everything good?
- Yeah. Just words.

429
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,450
Mr. Entrapment. How you doing?

430
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,250
Don't look like that.
I'm still dining out on that story.

431
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,249
You know how he beat
the wiretap a year ago?

432
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,650
Claimed entrapment when he was
clocking in Bunny Colvin's Hamsterdam.

433
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,249
Shit you not.

434
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,550
Smart kiddo. I loved it.

435
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,850
When I roll back in an hour,
this corner's bone-dry.

436
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,650
Your people are done for the day.

437
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,349
OK. So let's try this again.

438
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,350
I say, "have a good evening,
Mr. Broadus."

439
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,350
And a good evening to you,
Sergeant Carver.

440
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,050
See? We're right here.

441
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,550
And a very good evening
to you, Officer Colicchio.

442
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,850
Fuck yourself with a 40, shitbreath.

443
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,750
What the fuck was all that about?

444
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,249
You can't bust every head, Tony.

445
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,349
I can't?

446
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,550
Bust every head, who are you
gonna talk to when the shit happens?

447
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,350
Hi, Rachel.

448
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,649
Tim, thanks
for doing that yesterday.

449
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,650
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

450
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,950
You ran late all morning.

451
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,349
Late for the seniors,

452
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,050
late for the stonewall meeting
with Della.

453
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,501
Late for the gay-lesbian alliance.

454
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:41,708
Them seniors, they talk slow.

455
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:43,749
Bullshit. It was breakfast
with Young Tony

456
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,249
when they sat there swapping stories
over cold coffee.

457
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,750
- Young Tony?
- I was getting sage advice.

458
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,049
From a one-term mayor?

459
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,250
Wasn't his fault
he takes over in '67,

460
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,649
Sees the city burn.

461
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,149
That was an opportunity.

462
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,549
Spiro Agnew made his whole
career on the '68 riots.

463
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,250
- Agnew?
- One man's shithead's

464
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,049
- another man's vice president.
- True today as it ever was.

465
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,850
- Hey, is that polling data?
- Raw numbers. It's incomplete.

466
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,449
Right now, you need to be
in the call room,

467
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,350
- dialing for dollars.
- Fuck!

468
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,150
I can't do it anymore!

469
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,449
I hate it.
I hate it more than anything.

470
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,449
I fucking hate it!

471
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,549
You don't do this, you don't have
the money to pay for the damn TV spots

472
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,449
in the last two weeks.

473
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,050
Mothersucking cockfuckers.

474
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,150
Oh, Jesus. I fucking hate this.

475
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,649
Hey there, Jim.

476
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,850
Tom Carcetti here.
Remember me?

477
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,350
We met at your sister's house...

478
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,050
You know, the one that's married
to that republican cunt.

479
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,450
I know you don't remember me.

480
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:40,767
I know you don't have any use
for fucking politicians,

481
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,449
And frankly, I don't give a flying
fuck about what you think

482
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,850
or what your concerns are.

483
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,249
But I do care about what
your cute little blonde wife,

484
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,449
thinks about so many things.

485
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,050
But, Jim, the reason
I'm calling is because

486
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,349
I want you to write me out
a check for $4,000.

487
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,150
The maximum allowed by law.

488
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,749
Now, because we don't trust you
to actually mail that check,

489
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,050
We're gonna send over a couple
of furloughed DPW workers

490
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,449
to beat the check out of you.

491
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,450
All finished?
You need $30,000...

492
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,549
in the next 3 hours.

493
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,749
No bullshit, Tommy.

494
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,850
You hit your number
or die in this room.

495
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,650
Yeah, whatever.

496
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,350
So what are you watching, then?

497
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,050
Anything on the tube?

498
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,150
No fucking way.

499
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,649
They got enough power
in the middle of the lineup.

500
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,050
What they need is pitching.

501
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,750
What you looking at?

502
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,850
Fucking crazy.

503
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,650
Oh, like I'm really gonna give
them motherfucker a ride to Woodlawn.

504
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,750
Shit.

505
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,450
<i>Help! Somebody help!</i>

506
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,550
What's up, Patrice?

507
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,450
You're letting it ring, right?

508
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,849
You're not hanging up
after a ring or two?

509
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,384
I'm making the calls, Terri.

510
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:25,112
I don't know what to say.
Nobody's home.

511
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:27,850
30,000, Tommy.

512
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,650
<i>You mean Lex, the boy
who used to go with Patrice?</i>

513
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,849
<i>He her baby's daddy.</i>

514
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,549
<i>He ain't the first one
to get his spurt.</i>

515
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,949
<i>You ain't got to talk like that.</i>

516
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,050
<i>Nigger just walked up to him
outside of the Paragon</i>

517
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,050
<i>and served him up.</i>

518
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,350
<i>One to the face.</i>

519
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,850
<i>Shoot. He was real cute.</i>

520
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,650
<i>Lex and his 9 took all the cute
out of that lazy-eye motherfucker.</i>

521
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,950
Anything off his phone?

522
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,650
Nothing. I've gone for two hours.

523
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,549
<i>- Sure.
- It's no problem, though.</i>

524
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,850
Sure.

525
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,750
I really need your help.

526
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,150
<i>Put me down for 4.</i>

527
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,850
Well, how about your wife?
Think she can come up with 4?

528
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,350
<i>I don't think we can do 8.</i>

529
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,650
<i>- The kids?
- They're in strollers.</i>

530
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,750
I know they're in strollers.
I was kidding.

531
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,849
<i>That's funny.</i>

532
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,749
Yeah, never mind.
4,000 is good. Thanks.

533
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,149
<i>No problem.</i>

534
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,850
One to the left temple.

535
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,150
Close range in a lot
full of club trash,

536
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,050
but of course,
nobody sees a thing.

537
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,350
We hear your shooter goes by "Lex."

538
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,150
We were up on your victim's
cellphone, too.

539
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:41,948
We'll go back through the calls,
send you whatever's there.

540
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,704
Got this from his pocket.

541
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,149
You can pull numbers from that
as a consolation prize.

542
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,850
This fucks you guys up, don't it?

543
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,150
Losing a guy you had wired?

544
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,350
Nah. We're up on several
phones on the street level.

545
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,550
With or without Mr. Fruit,
we're on our way.

546
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,450
You know, it's strange.

547
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,850
We're not seeing bodies.

548
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,250
This is the first drug hit
in months,

549
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,550
and it's Marlo's boy who falls.

550
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,350
- I thought Marlo was the new power.
- He is.

551
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,450
Shit, he's got everything
from MLK to Fulton now.

552
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,350
How do you hold
that much real estate

553
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,350
without making bodies?

554
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,350
You hear anything more about
this murder on your wire, Lester,

555
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,150
The Bunk expects a call.

556
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,250
Yeah, I know he does.

557
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,250
The hell with Norris.

558
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,950
You're my real partner, Lester.
My life partner.

559
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,650
Don't tease, bitch.

560
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,750
Look at that bowlegged
motherfucker.

561
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,950
I made him walk like that.

562
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,150
So who the fuck is Lex?

563
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,266
- Dontrelle's cousin.

564
00:33:56,388 --> 00:33:58,250
Used to be with Cantel's people.

565
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,949
He working some corner
over the Hilltop now.

566
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,150
He ain't more connected than that?

567
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,650
And he coming near one of mine?

568
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,050
- Wasn't about no business.
- Pussy, man.

569
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,530
Yo, Fruit was into something
that Lex thought was his own.

570
00:34:10,623 --> 00:34:11,647
You say the word,

571
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:13,638
we take off that whole
motherfucking corner.

572
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,250
Every last one of them bitches.

573
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,049
What corner are we
talking about, again?

574
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,250
Ragtag shit up on Pacer.

575
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,250
Man, they get their shit from Joe,
but they're mostly independent.

576
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,850
They gone, Marlo.
Just say so.

577
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,649
That what you think?
Just do them all?

578
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,850
And take their fucking corner, too.

579
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,950
What do I want with some
off-brand Hilltop corner?

580
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,649
And why I need to
be stacking bodies

581
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,050
when there ain't no one
trying to war with us?

582
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,750
Just Lex.

583
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,750
He did one of us,
and he got to fall.

584
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,550
Get out, Tommy. You're done.

585
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,850
Get up, Tommy!

586
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,450
Come on, pretty boy. Come on.

587
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,850
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

588
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,850
Come on. Let's go.

589
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,949
Yeah. That's it.

590
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,550
There we go, little trooper.

591
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,850
6:30 tomorrow morning.

592
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,150
Don't make me drag you out of
bed like you did yesterday.

593
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,750
Damn, boy,
what happened to you?

594
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,149
Terrace boys banged me,

595
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,850
coming across the tracks
over there by Ramsey Street.

596
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,950
Teron, Manny, Herbie.

597
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,749
Man, all them Terrace niggers.

598
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,250
They can't whup on Dukie like that.

599
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,950
Yeah, I know.
Only we can whip on Dukie like that.

600
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,850
- We got to step it up, even this up.
- Nah. Fuck even.

601
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,450
We gonna hurt them twice as bad.

602
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,849
Give them a whup-ass
they ain't gonna never forget.

603
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,150
If we straight-up fight them,

604
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,850
It's as many of them
as it is us... more, even.

605
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,430
- So what you saying? You scared?
- Nah, I'm just saying.

606
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:31,450
If we're gonna hurt them,
we need to think on it.

607
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,550
Do something go past
beating on each other.

608
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,950
You talking guns and shit.

609
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,150
Nah, I ain't talking guns.

610
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,650
What?

611
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,150
Shit. Randy got an idea.

612
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,650
Hey, Norman.

613
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,650
You know what I had for dinner
last night?

614
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,850
Tuna sub. I ate in the car.

615
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,667
When I'm finished
writing my memoirs,

616
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,249
that shit'll be in there,
no doubt.

617
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,849
You see what I just ate?
In the car?

618
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,950
A fucking tuna sub.

619
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,949
In order to prevent distemper,
Norman,

620
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,450
you must vary the candidate's menu.

621
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,050
If you're done chewing,

622
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,550
let's give these new radio spots
a listen.

623
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,050
<i>We've seen what Tommy Carcetti
can do at City Hall as a councilman.</i>

624
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,649
<i>While the current administration
bent to special interests,</i>

625
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,050
<i>- Tommy Carcetti...
- What?</i>

626
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,350
<i>that is protecting jobs
at the fort</i>

627
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,077
<i>by preventing the overdevelopment
of our waterfront.</i>

628
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,150
300,000. Great.

629
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,850
Thanks for sharing.

630
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,950
<i>prevented budget cuts
to vital city services...</i>

631
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,650
3 and 5 zeroes...

632
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,850
Mayor's latest TV buy,
and it's 4 weeks out.

633
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,250
- Turn that shit off!
- You don't like the spots?

634
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,249
I read the copy
before the studio mix.

635
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,449
- I think they're strong.
- They're bullshit! Weak bullshit!

636
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,650
I wouldn't vote for me.

637
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,650
Fuck!

638
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,050
Fuck Royce! Fuck Tony Gray!

639
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,350
Fuck me!

640
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,550
Where am I going again?

641
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,049
One of those neighborhoods
between Oliver and Middle East.

642
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,149
Middle East.

643
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,350
Now, that's a good name
for a fucking Fallujah.

644
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,650
Command performance.

645
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,150
Ms. Victorina Simmons.

646
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,049
she holds sway over
two big vote precincts,

647
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,050
no matter who the EDC
is lying down with...

648
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,449
Fucking Royce!
300,000, like it's fucking water.

649
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,450
And then there's also
the Reverend Garnett.

650
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,249
What are they complaining
about today?

651
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,650
Fucking shithole of a city.

652
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,950
Whining bastards,

653
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,949
bitching about the trash
or the crime.

654
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,150
Or this or that.

655
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,250
It's my fucking fault
it went to shit.

656
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,849
These motherfuckers.

657
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,350
- Boss.
- They can bite my bloody ass.

658
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,950
Ms. Simmons.

659
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,950
Reverend Garnett.
Good to see you again.

660
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,450
I had a meeting going on,

661
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,950
but I'm here now, and I know
there's things to see.

662
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,150
We called and called downtown,
and ain't nothing gets done.

663
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,250
OK. Show me.

664
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,950
Right this way, Councilman.

665
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,850
The first thing I want you
to take a look at...

666
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,850
See, you got to drink a lot.

667
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,050
Think about the water running.

668
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,349
And that way, you know...

669
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,850
How the fuck you know what
water running be like, dude?

670
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,450
Water been off in your house
since last year.

671
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,049
- Man, that's cold.
- Yeah, that's cold, Nay.

672
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,550
Oh, shit. I'm ready.

673
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,050
Can't go when niggers watching, yo.

674
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,649
When we call,

675
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,350
he'll send somebody,
most of the time,

676
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,550
and they write it all down
just like he doing now.

677
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,450
But nothing ever gets done.

678
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,350
Come here, Councilman.
I want you to see this.

679
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,150
Now, see them drug boys?

680
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,616
They block the aisles like this

681
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,550
so the police
won't chase them down there.

682
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,150
All this trash.

683
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,350
Rats everywhere. Houses vacant.

684
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,750
We keep trying to get them
down here and clean this up.

685
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,350
I guess that's too much like right.

686
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,149
Well...

687
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,948
truth is, Royce won't let
the city agencies

688
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,050
take any of my constituent calls.

689
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,950
But let me see what I can do.

690
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,650
Come on, let me show you
this down here. Come on.

691
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,049
Yo, y'all Terrace niggers
know that boy

692
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,150
who go by the name "Dese"?

693
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,750
- Dese?
- Yeah, Dese Nuts.

694
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,650
Yo, yo, come on.
Come on. Come on.

695
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,749
Damn! I knew those bitches
was gonna set us up.

696
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,949
Yeah, fucking say it, bitches.

697
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,850
Don't ever disrespect Terrace.

698
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,649
Damn!

699
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,250
<i>- I fucking pissed myself.
- Fuck!</i>

700
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,350
<i>Over here!</i>

701
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,250
<i>Randy!</i>

702
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,450
<i>Hey, yo, he run in there!</i>

703
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,449
Remember that phrasing
is a cornerstone

704
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,050
in communicating
with your students.

705
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,250
This applies not only
to the questions you ask

706
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,550
or their comprehension
of the lesson,

707
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,949
but how they perceive you
as an educator.

708
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,950
and where does that begin?

709
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,850
Out loud and enthusiastically.

710
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:25,250
I.A.L.A.C.

711
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,650
Let's go. Once again.

712
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,450
I.A.L.A.C.

713
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,150
And what are we telling ourselves?

714
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:41,049
I am lovable and capable.

715
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,150
Now I see those smiling faces.

716
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,050
<i>...where the listing
on the lower half of the page</i>

717
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,550
<i>indicates some typical
soft target locations.</i>

718
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,250
<i>An officer alert to the terrorist
threat must ask himself</i>

719
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,150
<i>"Do I know the location
of my soft targets,</i>

720
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,949
those where large numbers
of civilians congregate?"

721
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:04,950
Train terminals,
office buildings, stadiums.

722
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,850
Another hot zone in the classroom
is the pencil sharpener,

723
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,750
where children tend to
congregate and...

724
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,450
I had a pencil sharpener
in my class once.

725
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,849
Antoine Granderson ripped it
from the wall and threw it at me.

726
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,050
I'd like to know
what your lesson plan suggests

727
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:22,049
when Harold Hounchell
sends a full set of textbooks

728
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,650
through a closed window.

729
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,650
Thank you.

730
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,650
<i>Settle down, everybody.</i>

731
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,650
<i>And for emergency procedures,
In the event of biochemical agents,</i>

732
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,050
<i>you can refer to appendix "b."</i>

733
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,550
No disrespect to your appendix,

734
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,545
but if them terrorists
do fuck up the Western,

735
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,050
could anybody even tell?

736
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,949
Some Al-Qaedas were up
on Baltimore Street

737
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,650
planning on blowing up
the chicken joint.

738
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,149
But Apex's crew jacked them up,
took their camels and robes,

739
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,549
Buried their asses,
[?]

740
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,849
At least that's what I heard.

741
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,750
Y'all want some real terrorists?
You go up on Pencey and Gold.

742
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,749
You're doing one heck of a job.

743
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,050
Not another fucking word.

744
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,950
<i>Thank you.</i>

745
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,350
<i>So...</i>

746
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,550
You beast.

747
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,350
I can't help it.
You stirred my manhood.

748
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,150
Little boy blue.

749
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,350
What the fuck
are you doing here?

750
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,850
I caught one. Got a street dealer,

751
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:31,350
by the name of Lex.
Lester heard it on the wire.

752
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,849
Lester's up on the wire?

753
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,850
Shit, boy, you are out of the loop.

754
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,550
You know this mutt?
Goes by Lex?

755
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,950
He is familiar.

756
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,750
You know who you should ask?
Carver.

757
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,650
He'd love the job, man.

758
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,750
All right. Carver it is.

759
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,350
I still feel the need
to pull your coat.

760
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,750
- For what?
- The taste, Jimmy. The taste.

761
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,749
How about you and me
hit a few of our favorite spots?

762
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,850
You know, me on the Glenlivet,
you on the Jamey?

763
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,649
Go see if that train
is still on the track.

764
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,150
Why don't you come round
some night for dinner?

765
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,750
Say hey to Beadie
and the ankle-biters.

766
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,050
Dinner?

767
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:16,035
<i>located in high-rise structures,
as well as residences,</i>

768
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,050
<i>are detailed alongside...</i>

769
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,150
Hey, Santy.

770
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,649
This horseshit? You serious?

771
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,750
Back to school for the kids.

772
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,449
Hey. Yo, Namond, I'll pay you back.

773
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,450
Nigger, you ain't never
gonna have no money.

774
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,550
- Yo, Michael, they got you.
- Ain't nothing but a scuffle, man.

775
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,350
Everybody made it back,
though, right?

776
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,950
Nah. Keith had to go []
to close up stitches.

777
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,150
He got hit with a brick.

778
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,949
I see you changed clothes already.

779
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,449
He had to. Yo, he was stinking.

780
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,850
Yo, Randy, man, that was

781
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,749
the stupidest thing
you ever thought of.

782
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,849
But it was kind of funny
when it happened, though.

783
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,150
You know what I'm saying?

784
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,050
Yo, you want something
before we bounce, I'm buying.

785
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:12,750
One for every solider
that stood tall.

786
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,450
- I was down there.
- Yeah, fuck you, Duke.

787
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,250
So you get out all right?

788
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,002
Yeah. Hurt my ankle
going around the corner, but...

789
00:46:31,115 --> 00:46:32,750
But you got away, then?

790
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,949
<i>The Lieutenant Governor
is up in arms</i>

791
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,249
<i>because two democratic
national committees...</i>

792
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,350
- I know we're way late...
- Ain't no thing. You did good here.

793
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,650
Turn that bullshit off.

794
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,849
You really think they're gonna
vote for the white guy?

795
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,150
Black folk been voting white
for a long time.

796
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,850
You come correct, we listen.

797
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,450
It's y'all that'll never vote black.

798
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,450
Shit, you got my vote, anyway.

799
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,350
I don't have your vote, Norman?

800
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,350
You're my deputy campaign manager,
and I don't have your vote?

801
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,950
Last white man I could
vote for was Bobby Kennedy,

802
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,950
And you ain't no Bobby K.

803
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,450
I thought you just said...

804
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,850
I was speaking in general about
the kindly nature of black folks.

805
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,450
In particular,
I ain't all that kindly.

806
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:38,950
So you're gonna take
my fucking check

807
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,849
and run with my fucking campaign...

808
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:44,950
Well, I do know who pays me.
Yessir! Oh, yessir, boss!

809
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,750
Who are you gonna vote for?
Royce? Tony gray?

810
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,750
One of them brothers.

811
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:11,950
Don't make me tell you again.
It's 9:00 sharp, boy.

812
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,850
And I'm smelling
what has to be urine.

813
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,549
What you been at, boy?

814
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:20,149
Well, we were playing
with Dukie today.

815
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,649
You know how he be
with his clothes and all.

816
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,250
Well, it's good that child
has friends, I suppose.

817
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,850
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get in there.

818
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,249
<i>- Come on, now, give me a break...
- Come on, Dougie. I know it's late,</i>

819
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,050
but I got to come backdoor like this,
or the agencies won't do shit.

820
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,350
You know that as well as I do.

821
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,250
<i>- Come on, Tommy...
- Come on, Tommy. Hustle.</i>

822
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,350
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

823
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,536
<i>- Come on, give me a break...
- Look, Dougie. Yeah.</i>

824
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,949
I'm sorry to bug you at home,
but this asshole Royce

825
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,649
won't handle a thing
out of my office,

826
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,350
and I need
a couple of alleys cleaned.

827
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,950
1200 block of Federal Street,
both sides,

828
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,946
and then Chester and Collington,
run in either direction off that.

829
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,998
<i>Jesus, Tommy.</i>

830
00:48:57,054 --> 00:48:59,383
I know you're gonna be out there
again in a couple of days

831
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,349
and can you call Frankie
in Special Services

832
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,549
And have him send a cold patch truck?
Federal Street's a fucking tank trap.

833
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,450
Great. Thanks. Love to Denise.

834
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,550
Hustle up, Tom.

835
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,350
How you doing? Good evening.

836
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,649
Hi.

837
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,450
You're over two hours late, Tommy.

838
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,850
You ain't gonna win
disrespecting your base.

839
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,950
Hold up, Tony.

840
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,450
Look, man. We got to talk.

841
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,749
I feel bad about the way
things have turned out,

842
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,350
but right or wrong,
if you're elected,

843
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,280
then I'm gonna do whatever
I can to help you,

844
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,750
and if I get in,
I'm gonna need your help.

845
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,750
I mean, it's not personal, Tony.

846
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,950
Fuck you, Tommy.

847
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,650
So this is me?

848
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,250
This is you.

849
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,050
<i>Pandemic!</i>

850
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,250
<i>Pandemic! Got that pandemic
right here!</i>

851
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,949
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

852
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,350
I got all this from the Koreans
today at a discount.

853
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,049
When school start,
I'll be selling it for 3 times that.

854
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,850
Tell you what...

855
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,550
let me get them skittles.

856
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:00,450
Nah. Do me a favor for the rest.

857
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,749
Go up the block and tell Lex

858
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:04,549
There's a girl that want to see him
at the playground behind Fort.

859
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:05,449
Girl?

860
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,550
Tell him Patrice say he should come
to the playground after 8:00.

861
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,850
- Why don't you tell him yourself?
- Look, dog,

862
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,149
I don't want to be taking none
of Bodie's shit today

863
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,049
about cutting work.

864
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,850
All right?
Just do me that favor.

865
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,650
<i>Pandemic!</i>

866
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,950
<i>Pandemic right here!</i>

867
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:24,350
For a skinny motherfucker,
he sure do sweat some.

868
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,349
We got to keep
an extra change in the car

869
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,749
So we don't have to come home
in the middle of the day.

870
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:31,050
Well, we're way past late now,
so...

871
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,350
- Damn it!
- Here, let me.

872
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,050
Hey Norman.

873
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:41,650
Maybe I'll go to clip-on
for a while.

874
00:51:42,368 --> 00:51:44,021
Hey, Terri got in new polling data.

875
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,129
Did you get a bump?

876
00:51:45,251 --> 00:51:47,654
Well, she won't show me anything
till it's all broke down,

877
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:49,950
But, yeah, I deserve a bump,
don't I?

878
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,650
4 more weeks, Jen.

879
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:12,050
Quality time with the wife and kids.

880
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,650
That's what, 4 minutes?

881
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,649
More like 6.

882
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,750
6. Shit, I could have got laid.

883
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,750
- Yo. Yo, Chris, I... I didn't...
- Yeah. It's good.

884
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,150
<i>Pandemic!</i>

885
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,250
<i>Pandemic right here!</i>

886
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,349
No Lex. Where's that skinny mope?

887
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,849
He was here earlier.

888
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:11,050
Well, fuck it. We'll come back,
jack him tomorrow, no problem.

889
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,250
All right.

890
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,050
<i>Yeah. If Mr. Money's playing,
let me heat these bad boys up.</i>

891
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,850
Share the sodas, too.

892
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,050
- What's up? What's up?
- Hey.

893
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,450
What's up?

894
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,650
Let me holla at you real quick.

895
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:42,950
What up?

896
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,950
You did like I said?

897
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:48,449
Yeah, you must have,

898
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:50,249
because the nigger
went up the block.

899
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,750
He ain't never coming back down.

900
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:55,550
Chris and Snoop...

901
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,550
- What?
- Look.

902
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,750
Just be cool, all right?

903
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:07,950
- Our heroes back from the wars.
- Those poll numbers tallied up yet?

904
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,850
- Not too bad, either.

905
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,750
Royce: 35, you: 26, Gray: 20.

906
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,581
19% undecided.

907
00:54:14,826 --> 00:54:17,032
We're fucked if we haven't
moved any more than that.

908
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:20,206
I need to be at 30, and I need
Tony taking 25 of his points.

909
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,877
Royce's negatives are way up.

910
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:25,534
Like, what, 34% unfavorable
to 43% favorable?

911
00:54:25,693 --> 00:54:28,482
- He's vulnerable.
- Geri, understand this.

912
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,473
In order to win, I need Tony Gray

913
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,717
to take a huge bite
out of Royce's lead... huge.

914
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,276
Tony's moved, what?

915
00:54:34,426 --> 00:54:35,825
Two points in the last month?

916
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:39,260
That poll says 1 in 5 voters
hasn't decided anything yet.

917
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,199
Yeah. The first batch of radio spots
worked magic, didn't they?

918
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,550
How much money
we piss away on those?

919
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,204
Look at these first district figures.
I mean, that's my base,

920
00:54:47,345 --> 00:54:50,294
and I'm polling 37%
with 24% undecided?

921
00:54:50,444 --> 00:54:51,665
Fuck me! I'm done!

922
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:54,050
Tommy, nobody's focused
on this race yet.

923
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,350
We're gonna own the first.

924
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,549
Christ, look at what Royce
is polling in the fourth.

925
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,050
No doubt, Tony's got to get
some traction in West Baltimore.

926
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:03,550
Yeah, he needs to be rounding 25%
and headed for 30.

927
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,050
And, by the way,

928
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:07,349
who can tell me when the fuck
did the sixth district

929
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,850
become 64% black?

930
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:11,550
About 5 years ago
in the last redistricting.

931
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,349
Mostly as I recall, to give your ass

932
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,350
more white votes
over there in the first.

933
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,849
What the fuck was I thinking?

934
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,750
A hell of a lot can happen
between now and election day.

935
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:24,650
I've been ahead further
than Royce is and lost.

936
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,250
I can't win this.

937
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,350
Tommy. Where the fuck you going?

938
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,950
I'm your ride home, man.

939
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,550
The man can read a poll.

940
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,350
You been drinking?

941
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:58,850
I'm fine.

942
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,150
Well, you need to be fine
somewhere else.

943
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,349
Park curfew is midnight.

944
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,550
City's averaging a murder a day,
and here you are with...

945
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,350
rec and park rules?

946
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:11,550
- What are you, a smart ass?
- Sorry.

947
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,450
I didn't mean nothing.

948
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:19,350
Don't I know you?

949
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,550
I'm running for mayor.

950
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:26,050
Tommy Carcetti, first district.

951
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,750
I'll be coming back through
in about 20, Councilman.

952
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,350
Do me a favor
and take it down the road.

953
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:34,350
- Randy?
- Yes, ma'am.
