appears to me that the dark
has a lot more territory.

00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:11,908
Yeah.

719
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:15,145
You're right about that.

Hey, listen, hey.

00:53:21,553 --> 00:53:22,952
Yeah, what?

723
00:53:22,987 --> 00:53:25,955
Why don't you point me in the
direction of the car, man?

724
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,993
I've spent enough of my
fuckin' life in hospitals.

725
00:53:30,027 --> 00:53:33,530
Jesus. Oh.
You know what?

726
00:53:33,565 --> 00:53:35,499
I'd protest,

727
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:39,002
but it occurs to me
that you're unkillable.

728
00:53:39,036 --> 00:53:41,471
You want to go back,
get clothes or anything?

729
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:45,676
No, anything I left back
there, I don't need.

00:53:50,515 --> 00:53:55,552
You know, you're looking at it wrong,
the... sky thing.

731
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:59,022
How is that?

732
00:53:59,056 --> 00:54:02,626
Well, once,
there was only dark.

733

If you ask me,
the light's winning.
