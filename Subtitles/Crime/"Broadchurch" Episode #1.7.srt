She says she forgives you about the
pendant.

3
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:07,047
I get messages - psychic messages.

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,351
You're saying Danny Latimer wants us

5
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:11,655
to know he was put in a boat before
he died?

6
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:13,671
I'm not his best friend! I hated him!

7
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:17,271
If someone deletes something from a
hard drive, is it gone forever?

Tom?

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,319
You assaulted a child after you'd
been drinking.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,623
You've no alibi for the night of
Danny's death.

11
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,639
When are we gonna talk about the
baby?

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,680
You stay away!

13
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:31,671
I know about your husband and your
children.

14
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:33,831
It's Danny's skateboard.
Who gave it to you?

15
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:37,552
Where's my dog? Bloody answer me!
Where is the dog?

16
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:40,023
What are we gonna do with you, boy?

17
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:43,335
There's been a break-in at the hut.
Someone reported torchlight inside.

18
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:44,376
Stop! Come on.

19
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:48,142
Get off!

(LABOURED BREATHING)

21
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:35,714
What are those?
Grapes.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,927
What did you bring grapes for? I
hoped you might choke on the seeds.

23
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:41,148
They're seedless.

24
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:43,216
Don't be a smartarse.

25
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:47,847
I'm sensing you're angry with me.
You nearly died on me.

26
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:50,108
No!
No, you did, they told me.

27
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:53,032
They can't do that.

28
00:01:53,464 --> 00:01:56,055
You discharged yourself
before against their advice

29
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:58,647
heart arrhythmia. You should've said.

30
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:00,663
Bloody hell! Is there no privacy
here?

31
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:02,104
Can't they fix you?

32
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:06,238
They want to put a pacemaker in me.

33
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:11,607
They don't know whether I'll survive
the operation.

34
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:13,988
How long have you been like this?

35
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:16,274
18 months or so.

36
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:20,103
It's got worse in the last month or
two.

37
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:21,724
So you came down here,

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,423
you took that case, you took that
job,

39
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:25,863
knowing you weren't up to it?

40
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,784
We're nearly there, Miller.

41
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:32,199
That was the killer last night, I'm
sure of it.

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,170
Sir, you're unfit for duty.

43
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:38,716
I have to finish this.

44
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,776
I can't let the family down.

45
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,743
Please, Miller, don't tell the Chief
Super. Please.

46
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:48,474
I'm going back to work.

47
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:51,927
Miller, wait. Please don't go,
Miller. Come back, Miller.

48
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:53,138
That's an order.

49
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:55,904

SOCO YOUNG: I hear that shitface is
laid up.

00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,735
Shitface?
It's what the lads call him.

52
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:05,895
Shitface? Not much of a nickname.

53
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:09,063
Well, he does look like shit a lot of
the time, doesn't he?

54
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,079
Is he gonna be all right?
Don't know.

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,391
Have you found anything?
We're only just up and running.

56
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:16,407
Your boys are checking the slope.

57
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:18,711
So you didn't catch proper sight of
this person?

58
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:21,303
No, wish I had.
Well, if you go through...

59
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:25,047
We can start at the back and do a
complete sweep all the way through.

60
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:27,063
Right.
Have a look in there.

61
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:29,223
SOCO are back up at the hut after
last night.

62
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:31,959
Frank, go through our list of people
of interest -

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,415
those with no alibis or questionable
alibis on the night of Danny's death.

64
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,575
Find out their movements from last
night.

65
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,879
The likelihood is, the killer was
there.

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,911
We were very close. They are rattled
and they will make more mistakes.

67
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:46,359
Susan Wright is in
custody, we've connected her

68
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,807
to the site where
Danny's body was found.

69
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:50,823
I'm continuing to question her,

70
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:54,567
but time is running out before we
have to apply for an extension.

71
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,303
I know this may sound daft, but we
need to find her dog, Vince.

72
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,634
We have a picture.

73
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:03,351
The dog is a priority. She's very attached
to it and it would help her to talk.

74
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:05,511
Uniform have turned up nothing so
far.

75
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:09,831
You probably know the boss was taken
ill last night, during the pursuit.

76
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,415
I don't know when he'll be back.

77
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,575
But we carry on. Do not get
distracted.

78
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:16,486
Our duty is still to the Latimer
family.

79
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:27,612
Thanks for everything you've done.
Bye for now.

80
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:33,015
Don't be ridiculous!
Don't start, Miller.

81
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:34,887
You can't be here.
Well, I am.

82
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:37,479
You'll kill yourself!
If that's what it takes.

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,071
It's not worth dying for.
Not for you, maybe.

84
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,231
Go away. We can manage without you.

85
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:44,607
That's what you've wanted
right from the start, this job

86
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,983
the job you think I stole.

87
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:50,727
For God's sake, sir! Come on,
Miller. With me out you get to lead.

88
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:52,887
Dream come true.
I wouldn't want your job.

89
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:57,207
Don't be daft. If you get offered it,
you'd take it. I wouldn't be up to it.

90
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,068
Yeah, you're right.
What?

91
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:02,391
Well, it's a tough job.
You've found your level.

92

Rural DS - keep within your limits.

93
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,279
Don't tell me what my limits are!

94
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,530
Then don't tell me to go home.

95
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:12,903
I can still solve this. Otherwise,
why am I still here?

96
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:15,224
For God's sake. All right, then.

97
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,412
Right, everyone, back to work.

Fine.

knew you were this ill?

Susan Wright's alibi for the night
of Danny's death checks out.

The owner of the caravan park saw her

111
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:56,727
sitting in the window
watching TV with her dog

They'd had a birthday
party in the bar which

114
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,919
is why he was so late
leaving that night.

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,799
We've had a match at the hut on the
cliff for her DNA and prints,

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,111
but the owner has already confirmed
she does clean there.

117
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,127
No matches for any DNA on Danny's
body.

118
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:12,978
So she didn't kill Danny?

But she knows something, I'm sure of
it.

120
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:17,607
Don't sit here talking to me, go and
get it out of her!

don't understand anything... love.

time now.

I have lost so much patience.

00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,935
If you don't tell me how
you came by the board,

133
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:10,455
I will have you charged.
You will be in custody.

134

him put down.

00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:22,836
I was just going out, up from my
caravan.

137
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:26,108
Up the hill onto the cliff top.

138
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:30,424
When we got up there...

139
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:33,636
.. I saw it.

140
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:34,906
Saw what?

141
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:36,694
The boy...

142
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,254
lying there.

143
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:41,398
Anything else?

144
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:45,624
We walked back down the hill onto the
beach.

145
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:47,704
And what time was this?

146
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:50,328
Three, maybe four.

147
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:52,832
That's when you walk your dog?

148
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,142
It's lovely during the night round
here.

149
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:59,816
So you walked down onto the beach...

150
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:01,836
He was all...

151
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,158
.. splayed out.

152
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:07,818
The skateboard was next to him.

153
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:09,708
He was beautiful.

154
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,442
You've got children?

155
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:38,408
Yeah.

156
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:43,767
If you've got kids, I don't understand
how you could stand over Danny's body,

157
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:46,071
smoke and then carry on walking your
dog.

158
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:47,682
I knew he'd be found.

159
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:51,728
I didn't want to get involved.

160
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,296
You people destroyed my family.

161
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:00,092
How?

162
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:03,986
It don't matter.

163
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:09,106
It does, because it affected how you
were when you saw Danny's body.

164
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:14,846
We had two girls.

165
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:19,852
My husband was an electrician.

166
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:26,535
He used to have sex with the oldest,
but I didn't know.

167
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:28,551
Then he tried it on with the young
one.

168
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:30,932
Her sister was having none of it.

169
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:36,946
She wanted to protect her little baby
sister.

170
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,636
So she got herself killed.

171
00:10:41,512 --> 00:10:43,892
He told me she'd gone travelling.

172
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:47,228
She'd never said nothing to me.

173
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:53,288
After a while, people started asking
questions.

174
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,978
Then you lot came, took the young one
into care.

175
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,890
Arrested him.

176
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:09,258
He told them that I knew...

177
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:13,148
.. that I was part of it, but...

178
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
.. I didn't know. I never knew.

179
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,060
I was pregnant.

180
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,004
Social Services came.

181
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,950
They took the baby.

182
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,682
They said I wasn't a fit mother.

183
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:37,424
Everything I told the police got
twisted,

184
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:39,866
thrown back at me.

185
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:42,924
He was convicted.

186
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,410
Got life.

187
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:49,918
Hung himself in his cell ten months
later.

188
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:55,268
Death.

189
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,534
Once it's got its claws into you...

190
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:03,974
.. it never lets go.

191
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,360
When I was standing on that beach,

192
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,928
looking at that boy's body, I just
kept wondering if...

193
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,714
.. if my girl looked that peaceful
after he killed her.

194
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:32,478
I don't think she did.

195
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,150
OK, petal.

196
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,616
You are a gem, a precious gem.

197
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:53,448
No, Mum's the word.

198
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:54,918
Thank you.

199
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:00,572
Olly, Olly. Here.

200
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:04,679
You're looking a bit giddy there.

201
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,135
Yvonne, in the hospital, doing her
welcome carer thing.

202
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:09,406
Who does she see?

203
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:10,842
DI Hardy.

204
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:13,306
Well, you know Yvonne.

205
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:16,631
She went straight into military
eavesdropping mode.

206
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:18,662
He was rushed in last night.

207
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,815
Heart problems, serious. Now he's
discharged himself.

208
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,196
He's gone back to work?
Exactly!

209
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:27,474
Have we got a story brewing here,
sweetheart.

210
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:33,548
How would you like to put it to him?

211
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:40,103
You were the last person I expected
to call.

212
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:42,263
Really? Surely nothing's a surprise
to you?

213
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:44,711
Very funny. I've never heard that
one before.

214
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:45,982
What do you want?

215
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:51,191
The Latimer case. I'll take anything
now, cos I'm running out of time.

216
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:53,207
So if you have anything for me,

217
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,588
give it to me now.

218
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,906
Thank you. It's about time.

219
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,270
Look, I've been trying to tell you,
I got a message from Danny.

220
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,120
It was someone he knew.

221
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:08,546
It was someone close to home.

222
00:14:09,624 --> 00:14:11,074
What does that mean?

223
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,050
Close geographically?

224
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:17,111
Family, friends, what?
I don't know.

225
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:17,452
I...

226
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,976
Just don't ignore it.

227
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,232
Prove to me that you're not a
bullshitter.

228
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,495
I gave you something, I told you.
You just pretended to ignore it.

229
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:32,586
I said, "She forgives you for the
pendant. "

230
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,690
What does that mean?

231
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,703
You already know, I can see it.

232
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,719
I haven't got a clue what it means.

233
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,780
All I get are fragments and that's
what I got from you.

234
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,631
That and that you've been here
before.

235
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:47,032
What?

236
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:48,822
Just that.

237
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:52,938
You have.

238
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:55,847
You have, you've been here before!

239
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:57,398
I'm right, aren't I?

240
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:58,314
I am.

241
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,810
How's it feel...

242
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:05,116
having to eat humble pie like this?

243
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,600
DI Hardy?
No.

244
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:18,455
But you don't know what I want.
I know the answer's no.

245
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:20,327
How are you feeling?
What did you say?

246
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:22,055
You were at the hospital.

247
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:24,215
I don't know what the hell you're
playing at.

248
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:28,391
You were rushed to hospital, heart
problems. You discharged yourself.

249
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:31,412
I don't want to stitch you up,
genuinely.

250
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,167
So what do you want?

251
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,098
An exclusive.

252
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:42,071
Everybody wants us to see counsellors,

253
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:44,375
but I don't want to share
what I feel with a stranger.

254
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:48,806
Don't rule it out. There are some
really great people locally.

255
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,143
I know it doesn't seem like it
but...

256
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:52,424
talking will help.

257
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,880
We thought that...

258
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:59,394
Well, Beth suggested and I agreed,
that er...

259
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:02,375
.. maybe you could counsel us.

260
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:03,816
That's why we came.

261
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:04,852
Right.

262
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:08,423
BETH: You know us, you know what
it's been like.

263
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:09,634
And you're kind.

264
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,767
We just thought you could help, you know?
But not from a religious point of view.

265
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:18,647
You can mention God. We don't want
banging over the head with it.

266
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:20,688
No, I understand. No banging.

267
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:23,488
Well...

268
00:16:24,264 --> 00:16:26,414
listen, I'd be honoured but...

269
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:27,486
why now?

270
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:29,274
The baby.

271
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:31,754
We're due for the scan.

272
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,775
But I don't know if I want to see
it.

273
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,935
I want to want it but I don't.
Don't say that.

274
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:39,815
It's all right, Mark.
My heart is still full of Danny.

275
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:42,407
There isn't room for another baby.
There will be.

276
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:44,423
Stop telling me how I'm going to
feel!

277
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:47,591
Because you have no idea and no
ability to understand.

278
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:49,895
Shutting this out is not an option
for me.

279
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:53,256
I can't do that boxing thing off
that you do.

280
00:16:54,216 --> 00:16:56,087
I have to carry another life in me.

281
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:57,538
For six more months.

282
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,423
Feeding off me, breathing from me,
sharing my blood.

283
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:05,591
While you're still grieving.
Yes. And I can't let Danny go.

284
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,692
Nobody's telling you... Sorry.

285
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,215
It's difficult, isn't it? Sorry.

286
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:13,376
You should talk.

287
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:16,076
All I want...

288
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:20,474
.. is to swap places with Danny.

289
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:23,116
Let me be taken instead of him.

290
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:28,775
In the night, I lie there and I think,
"What would I go through to have him back?"

291
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:33,671
I'd be raped, I'd be tortured, I'd have
a gang of men on me, I'd be left for dead,

292
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:35,462
if it meant he was safe.

293
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:40,308
Are you all right, Mark?

294
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:41,104
Yeah...

295
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,055
We just need some answers, don't we?

296
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:46,806
Some help.

297
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,130
You have a line to the big man.
Why don't you ask him?

298
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:56,352
We're drowning down here.

299
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:02,327
We just want it done, don't we?

300
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:03,018
I mean...

301
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,992
When we met, she was 15, Beth.

302
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:11,862
She was...

303
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:14,178
just beautiful.

304
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:18,208
She was so sunny all the time.

305
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:25,866
And now this life with me, it's just
destroyed her, hasn't it?

306
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:27,934
That girl's gone.

307
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:35,447
So I just keeping thinking how your
life would be if you'd never met me.

308
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,828
This isn't on you.

309
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,060
Can I make a suggestion?

310
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:43,632
New life is... a gift.

311
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:48,263
And maybe you can take in this gift,

312
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:50,514
even if you don't want it yet.

313
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:55,506
Go for the scan, see how you feel.

314
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:59,207
Because God has sent you this life.

315
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,008
You may not agree, but...

316
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:03,884
.. perhaps he's...

317
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:09,194
.. sent you not what you want...

318
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,034
.. but what you need.

319
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:01,559
ELLIE: What I'm struggling with is,
I know those cliffs.

320
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,295
If you're walking your dog, you
can't see straight down.

321
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:08,183
You'd have to be right on the edge to
see Danny's body lying on the beach.

322
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:11,207
The angle's wrong. So what you're
saying doesn't ring true.

323
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:14,518
If you don't believe me, that's your
problem.

324
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:17,914
I think you saw more than you're
telling us.

325
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:19,536
So have a good think.

326
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:23,015
Or I will charge you for obstructing
a murder inquiry.

327
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:24,636
I didn't see anything.

328
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:28,428
Like you didn't see what your
husband was up to?

329
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:35,976
You were out walking when Danny's body
was laid on the beach. What did you see?

330
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:40,578
A boat.

331
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,058
I wasn't on the cliffs.

332
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:49,944
I was on the beach.

333
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,130
I saw a boat come in.

334
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:56,026
What sort of boat?

335
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,412
Little... like a rowing boat.

336
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,630
But it had a motor on the back.

337
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:06,215
I saw it come into shore.

338
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:08,375
ELLIE: How many people on board?

339
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:09,671
One.
Are you sure?

340
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:10,252
Certain.

341
00:21:10,824 --> 00:21:12,204
I saw him get off.

342
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:14,423
Him? Are you sure it was a man?

343
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:14,824
Yeah.

344
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:19,046
And what did that person do?

345
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,140
He carried the body off the boat...

346
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:29,786
.. and laid it on the beach.

347
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:36,743
Then he got back on the boat and went
off.

348
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:38,324
Which direction?
West.

349
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:44,718
And did you recognise the person
that laid Danny's body on the beach?

350
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:50,596
Susan?

351
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:57,016
Yeah.

352
00:21:58,056 --> 00:21:58,976
Yeah, I did.

353
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,208
Mum, please go back inside.

354
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:14,814
Ellie, can you take my mum in,
please?

357
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:51,304
Mark?

358
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,470
Yeah.
It's Nige.

359
00:22:53,784 --> 00:22:54,944
All right, mate.

360
00:22:55,512 --> 00:22:57,527
I want you to hear this from me.

361
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,558
The police have taken me in.

362
00:23:00,408 --> 00:23:03,143
And you're my phone call.
Taken you in for what?

363
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:06,344
They think I had something to do with
Danny.

364
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:10,794
It's all wrong, this. You know that.

365
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:14,794
Hey. Hey, I'll see you
when you're done.

366
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:18,328
Don't worry about anything. You
just...

367
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:22,078
You tell them the truth and stay
strong. All right?

368
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,374
All right. I have to go.

369
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:29,642
I have to talk to them.

370
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,490
Right, you take Susan.
I'll take Nigel.

371
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:53,498
Find out how she knows him,

372
00:23:53,544 --> 00:23:55,174
what the connection is.

373
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:59,015
I'll see where he says he was that
night.

374
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:00,455
And why the hell he had her dog.

375
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:04,546
Are you all right to question him?
Feeling OK? Spectacular.

376
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,663
Run me through where you were the
night Danny Latimer was killed.

377
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:11,687
We went through all this weeks ago,
when you had Mark in.

378
00:24:11,688 --> 00:24:14,423
I was at home with my mum and we was
watching telly.

379
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:16,524
What were you watching?
Um...

380
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:18,034
A show about baking.

381
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:19,988
Mum loves that.

382
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:24,782
Do you know this woman, Nigel?

383
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:27,526
Don't think so.

384
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:30,576
Do you own a dog?

385
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:35,178
Not really.
Not really? What, sometimes you do?

386
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:37,751
The dog comes around part-time?
No.

387
00:24:37,752 --> 00:24:39,202
This amusing to you?

388
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:45,095
I don't own a dog. Why was there a
dog in your back garden?

389
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:47,255
Someone asked me to look after it
for 'em.

390
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:48,826
The owner? This woman?

391
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:52,988
Susan Wright? Who you said you didn't
know.

392
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:58,199
If you're gonna lie, you have to be
consistent.

393
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,511
Cos then there's the issue of your
alibi for the night of Danny's death.

394
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:03,959
The one you told us about when we
were interviewing Mark.

395
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,551
It was good enough for then, but not
now?

396
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:09,431
Your mum already told us you weren't
in all that night.

397
00:25:09,432 --> 00:25:14,039
You went out at half-ten for last orders,
she said, when we had Matt Latimer here.

398
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,840
So where were you, Nigel?

399
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:20,519
You must know Nigel pretty well to
recognise him at night from that distance.

400
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,391
When did you last see Nigel?

401
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:24,012
A couple of weeks ago.

402
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:28,208
He came to the caravan. He had a
crossbow.

403
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:32,759
Threatened to kill me.
OK. Why did he do that?

404
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,000
You'll have to ask him.
No, I'm asking you.

405
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:39,527
He didn't like what I was saying.
What were you saying?

406
00:25:39,528 --> 00:25:40,628
Don't remember.

407
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:45,863
Don't remember what you said to make
a man threaten you with a crossbow?

408
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:49,031
No, not really.
It happens a lot to you, does it?

409
00:25:49,032 --> 00:25:49,892
Off and on.

410
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:53,306
It ain't always a crossbow.

411
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:56,807
So Nigel threatens you for some
unknown reason

412
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:59,128
and you frame him as the killer?

413
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:02,414
It was him carrying that body.

414
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:08,183
How do you know Susan Wright?
I don't want to talk about her.

415
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:11,927
You should have her arrested, have
her in for harassment.

416
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:15,095
I told her to leave me alone but she
wouldn't.

417
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:17,426
When did she start harassing you?

418
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:20,999
The moment she got here. Like... four
or five months back.

419
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,210
What's she harassing you about?

420
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:32,375
Susan Wright told us she believes you
killed Danny Latimer.

421
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:35,831
She said she saw you on the beach
with a boat, dragging Danny's body.

422
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:38,423
She's lying. Did you drag Danny's
body onto the beach?

423
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:42,023
Did you kill Danny? No, he's my best
mate's boy. Why would I?

424
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:44,903
Then why is Susan Wright saying
otherwise?

425
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,454
What's she got to harass you about?

426
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:57,374
She says she's my mum.

427
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:03,335
Her son? And she's accusing him of
murder? What's going on between them two?

428
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:04,896
You'd better ask her.

429
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:12,407
SUSAN: They took him away from me
when everything happened.

430
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:13,098
25 years.

431
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:19,102
Then the law changed.

432
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,570
You could request contact.

433
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:26,394
Took me 18 months to track him down.

434
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,710
I didn't know I was adopted until
she came.

435
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:34,439
SUSAN: He reacted badly. Didn't want
nothing to do with me.

436
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,743
He threatened me with a crossbow.

437
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:38,615
NIGEL: I know, and that was stupid,

438
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,826
but with everything that was going
on, she...

439
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:43,752
she didn't belong here.

440
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:46,391
There's enough to deal with.

441
00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:49,991
Does he know about your family,
about what happened?

442
00:27:49,992 --> 00:27:51,432
You don't tell him.

443
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:55,463
I'm having trouble with, if you're his
mum and you want to be reconciled with him,

444
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:57,911
why did you tell us he was on the
beach that night?

445
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:01,511
I'm a mum, and whatever my child had
done, I would want to protect them.

446
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:02,962
I am protecting him.

447
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:07,744
I told you because I'm scared.

448
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:10,206
For him.

449
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,570
Because it's not his fault.

450
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:20,366
If he's his father's son, what is he
capable of?

451
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,700
What might he have done?

452
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,140
I can't just let it happen.

453
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:27,894
Not again.

454
00:28:28,728 --> 00:28:33,268
Nigel, you need to tell us where you
were the night Danny died.

455
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:37,458
At night...

456
00:28:39,096 --> 00:28:41,996
I went out, just for a couple of
hours.

457
00:28:42,552 --> 00:28:45,162
I went to the estate. Past Oak Farm.

458
00:28:47,448 --> 00:28:50,759
They've been laying down pheasant,
so I just went and got a couple.

459
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,060
I mean, he's got dozens. He don't
even know.

460
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,814
You were nicking pheasants?

461
00:28:59,544 --> 00:28:59,944
Yeah.

462
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:05,564
The butcher in town takes 'em off my
hands.

463
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:11,022
It's not like... like I'm gonna make
me fortune working with Mark.

464
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:15,858
But... I forgot to fill up the van.

465
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,310
So um...

466
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:22,734
I siphoned some diesel out of his
tractor.

467
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:30,359
And then I cut through the barbed-wire
fence to make it look like a break-in.

468
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,800
But I was nowhere near that beach.

469
00:29:34,104 --> 00:29:36,695
Whatever she thought she saw, she
didn't.

470
00:29:36,696 --> 00:29:40,516
So she's lying?
Mate, I don't even know who she is.

471
00:29:42,024 --> 00:29:44,454
Do you want to know... who she is?

472
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:52,772
Because... in here there are newspaper
articles about her.

473
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:56,696
About her husband.

474
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,900
It's your family, Nigel.

475
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:08,338
Interview paused 3:02pm.

476
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,039
You did what?
He wanted to know.

477
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,631
I promised her.
What did you do that for?

478
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:56,223
I was gaining her trust.
I was gaining his.

479
00:30:56,224 --> 00:31:00,255
We have to cut through what's
connected to Danny and what isn't.

480
00:31:00,256 --> 00:31:02,271
You're the only one running out of
time.

481
00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:05,871
These are people's lives your
trampling on. I should make a complaint.

482
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:08,319
Go ahead. Add it to the list. I'll
sign it for you.

483
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,911
He's a suspect. He was seen with the
body.

484
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:14,655
The information I gave him has bearing
on the witness who is accusing him.

485
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:18,543
You should have let her tell him. I don't
believe Nigel was capable of killing Danny.

486
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,855
Everyone we have interviewed is
capable in the right circumstances.

487
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,167
That's your view of the world. I
don't know how you sleep.

488
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:26,438
Who says I sleep?

489
00:31:27,328 --> 00:31:28,718
Have you seen this?

490
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,223
I got them to trace the
number of the call that

491
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,239
phoned in to tell us the
light was on in the hut.

492
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,790
It's Danny's mobile. It's the missing
smartphone.

493
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,727
Oh, my God. The killer phoned in.
Why would he do that?

494
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:45,759
Why tell us where they were and then
run? That don't make sense.

495
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,200
Oh, for God's sake.

496
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:53,686
As if working with you wasn't annoying
enough, what are they playing at?

497
00:31:53,968 --> 00:31:57,408
All right. Get Nigel and Susan
released on bail.

498
00:31:58,432 --> 00:32:01,599
Have them lodge their passports here
and report in every day.

499
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,631
You're gonna let them both out together?
I'll cobble together some surveillance.

500
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,223
Use some of those numpties they
drafted in.

501
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:11,679
Maybe Nigel and Susan are both lying.
Let's see what happens.

502
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,991
Light the blue touchpaper and then
retire? We're running out of time.

503
00:32:14,992 --> 00:32:17,382
Well, you might be.
(PHONE RINGS)

504
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,220
Hello.

505
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:25,472
Yeah.

506
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:30,128
I'll be right over.
Over where?

507
00:32:32,128 --> 00:32:32,938
You... Ugh!

508
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,130
I've got something for you.

509
00:32:56,608 --> 00:33:00,927
This is Tom Miller's laptop. I caught
him smashing it up in the woods.

510
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,367
You just stumbled across him?

511
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:04,815
I was out walking. It's the route I
take.

512
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,271
Do you know what he was trying to get
rid of? I've no idea.

513
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:11,007
Why did he do that, just after his
best mate's died?

514
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:13,887
Were they best friends? I didn't see
much evidence of it.

515
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:16,335
I had to break up a fight between
them.

516
00:33:16,336 --> 00:33:18,639
When was this?
A couple of months ago.

517
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,320
They were having a row.

518
00:33:20,368 --> 00:33:22,815
Tom was really, really laying into
Danny.

519
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:24,726
And he's that much bigger.

520
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:30,015
I reported it to both sets of parents.
I thought Ellie would have told you.

521
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:31,926
No. She didn't mention it.

522
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:36,822
Look, I should tell you that Tom
knows that I have this.

523
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:42,046
He threatened to tell you that I
abused Danny, if I handed it over.

524
00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:44,532
He said that?

525
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,480
And did you...

526
00:33:50,032 --> 00:33:51,022
.. abuse Danny?

527
00:33:52,048 --> 00:33:52,328
No.

528
00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:04,112
What were you talking to Tom Miller
about at Jack Marshall's wake?

529
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:08,302
I was just making sure he was OK.

530
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:13,736
Thanks.

531
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:22,288
You need to report in to us every
evening at 6pm.

532
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:25,968
Why do you keep looking at me like
that?

533
00:34:26,032 --> 00:34:29,872
Back then, in your own house, how
could you not know?

534
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:39,423
I need a wee favour on the quiet.
Things are complicated.

535
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:42,444
Can you get stuff off Danny's hard
drive?

536
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,063
Oh, great. I owe you one. Will you send
whatever you find to my personal email?

537
00:34:48,064 --> 00:34:49,624
Great. You're a star.

538
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,170
All right. Can you just take us
through what happened last night?

539
00:35:19,312 --> 00:35:21,112
I was pursuing a suspect.

540
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,351
There was an incident and I was
injured.

541
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:26,152
Can you name the suspect?

542
00:35:26,512 --> 00:35:29,932
No. And I'm asking you don't publish
this yet.

543
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,538
Give me a couple of days.

544
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,310
All right.

545
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,591
Olly just has a couple of questions
first.

546
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,512
Oh, does he?

547
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:42,495
The Sandbrook case fell apart at the
trial.

548
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:44,236
Tell me what went wrong.

549
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:47,103
Are you serious?
He's more than serious.

550
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,204
He's myprotege.

551
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:52,719
We've seen you here. We know you're
doing your best for the family, the town.

552
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,039
I don't think it was any different on
Sandbrook. So tell me what happened.

553
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,060
How did it all go so wrong?

554
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,698
You can't keep it secret for ever.

555
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,790
Maybe you're right.

556
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:12,134
Maybe it is time.

557
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,150
We had our prime suspect but all of
the evidence was circumstantial.

558
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,920
Um... but then during a...

559
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,128
search of a car that he'd just
sold...

560
00:36:51,472 --> 00:36:54,022
.. one of my DS's found a pendant...

561
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:57,198
.. belonging to one of the girls.

562
00:36:57,952 --> 00:37:01,263
There were clearly prints on it. It
was the smoking gun.

563
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:04,874
My DS was taking the bagged evidence
back to HQ...

564
00:37:11,056 --> 00:37:12,046
.. and... she...

565
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,255
.. stopped at a hotel for a drink

566
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:20,286
and her car was broken into.

567
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:27,916
The car radio and valuables in her
bag were all taken.

568
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:31,071
Just a quick smash and grab. Local
kids, probably.

569
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:32,232
And the pendant?

570
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:39,423
Yeah. We couldn't make the case after
that, so he's still out there.

571
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,914
Why did she stop off at the hotel?

572
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:56,652
She was having an affair with one of
the other DS's on the team.

573
00:37:57,856 --> 00:37:59,836
She thought she'd celebrate.

574
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,319
But this was all reported at the
time.

575
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,120
The Herald got the story.

576
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,606
But they said it was you, your car.

577
00:38:09,376 --> 00:38:12,111
You took the blame.
It happened on my watch.

578
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:13,332
She deceived you?

579
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:17,328
This detective sergeant...

580
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:22,946
.. she was my wife.

581
00:38:24,784 --> 00:38:29,904
We have a daughter and I didn't want
her knowing that about her mother.

582
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:31,695
So...
You took the blame.

583
00:38:31,696 --> 00:38:36,056
You took all that flak for years.
The family think it's you.

584
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:41,199
But you didn't do it. This is what
made you ill, isn't it?

585
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,503
People need to know about this?
Do they?

586
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:44,374
Really? Why?

587
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:57,366
Just do me a favour and tell the
family first, will you?

588
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:05,392
Just tell them I haven't given up on
Sandbrook and that the case is still open.

589
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:10,863
And then do whatever you like with
it.

590
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:15,004
Call your friend Karen. This is what
she's always wanting.

591
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:20,772
One one condition. You do not name
that DS.

592
00:39:32,176 --> 00:39:32,636
Right.

593
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,054
Well, I'm done.

594
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,919
How did you get in here?

595
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,290
If you don't go within the hour,

596
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:18,106
I will gut this dog whilst you
sleep.

597
00:40:27,184 --> 00:40:29,434
If I go... I'm not coming back.

598
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:35,468
We'll never see each other again.

599
00:40:37,408 --> 00:40:38,498
I can do that.

600
00:40:40,576 --> 00:40:42,716
I've done it plenty of times.

601
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:52,948
You contact the police and tell them
you made a mistake.

602
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,442
It wasn't me you saw.

603
00:40:58,144 --> 00:40:59,354
And then you go.

604
00:41:00,016 --> 00:41:02,216
You're the spit of him, Nigel.

605
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,422
You've got him in you.

606
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:09,258
And it was you I saw.

607
00:41:19,456 --> 00:41:21,759
That was great, Mrs Latimer. Thank
you.

608
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,910
Dean, love, just call me Beth.

609
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:27,231
"Mrs Latimer" makes me feel like
Mark's mum.

610
00:41:27,232 --> 00:41:29,082
And none of us want that.

611
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,854
Oh, er, I got you something.

612
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,350
For me?
For all of you.

613
00:41:36,304 --> 00:41:38,895
Oh.
For the family. For letting me in.

614
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,286
And for the future.

615
00:41:42,928 --> 00:41:44,958
But mainly for the new baby.

616
00:41:45,808 --> 00:41:48,298
It's the first one, for the new...

617
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:57,183
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

618
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:59,614
Oh, don't worry, mate. It's er...

619
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:03,206
It's all a bit muddled in with
everything else.

620
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:05,826
He was a good lad, Dan.

621
00:42:08,848 --> 00:42:12,591
Heard anything about Nige? No. I
asked Pete but he's heard no news.

622
00:42:12,592 --> 00:42:16,191
It's not Nige, Dad. Don't go
thinking that. It won't be.

623
00:42:16,192 --> 00:42:18,562
Chloe's right. It can't be Nige.

624
00:42:19,216 --> 00:42:23,566
Him and Dan really got on. I saw it
every time we went out.

625
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,150
What do you mean "went out"?

626
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:33,039
Catching animals. They'd come up to the
farm and then we'd go out from there.

627
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,030
Late evenings.

628
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,360
Danny said it was OK.

629
00:42:42,256 --> 00:42:43,646
Nige said you knew.

630
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:46,722
No. No, we didn't know.

631
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,800
Miller? Forensics from the hut.

632
00:42:57,664 --> 00:43:02,264
Boot print in the mud up the hill
matches one they found inside.

633
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:06,526
It's a man's size ten. What's Nigel
Carter's shoe size?

634
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:11,972
Ten.

635
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:16,239
So, what? You think Susan did see
Nige?

636
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,340
Are we missing something here?

637
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:23,871
What if another person was involved?
Is this something for the morning?

638
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:27,327
Oh, by the way. Your boy and Danny.
Did they fall out?

639
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:30,351
No. Paul Coates, the vicar,
said there was a fight.

640
00:43:30,352 --> 00:43:33,192
He mentioned it to you.
No, he didn't.

641
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:36,255
Are you saying I've been covering
for my son? No.

642
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:38,703
You do that when you're on the back
foot. You lash out.

643
00:43:38,704 --> 00:43:41,583
When did Danny last come up your
house? It's 2 a. m. I don't know.

644
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:43,564
Last month? Last two months?

645
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,580
A bit longer.

646
00:43:46,192 --> 00:43:48,752
Can we borrow Tom's computer?
Fine.

647
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:50,602
Good night.

648
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:27,526
What are you doing?
Where is his computer?

649
00:44:28,096 --> 00:44:30,526
El, it's half two in the morning.

650
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,567
I'm sorry. Right? I don't know where
it is.

651
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:54,303
If we go through his room now, we'll
wake him. Do it tomorrow.

652
00:44:54,304 --> 00:44:57,039
That's your answer for everything -
do it tomorrow.

653
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,775
What? What have I done?
Yeah, what have you done?

654
00:44:59,776 --> 00:45:02,655
You can't even finish painting this
room. Six bloody months.

655
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:05,026
For God's sake. Go to sleep, El.

656
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,270
Of course.

657
00:45:23,536 --> 00:45:23,936
Shit.
