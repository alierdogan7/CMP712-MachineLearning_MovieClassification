1
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:33,775
Based on the true story

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,218
I aIways wanted to be
in the movies

3
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:46,415
When I was IittIe I thought for sure
1 day, I couId be a big big star...

4
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,686
Or maybe just beautifuI...

5
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:52,262
BeautifuI and rich,
Iike the women on TV

6
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:55,558
Yeah, I had a Iot of dreams

7
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:58,193
And I guess you can
caII me a reaI romaniac

8
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:02,035
Because I truIy beIieve that
1 day...they'II come true

9
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,934
So I dream about for hours

10
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:08,782
It was the year whiIe I Iearnt,
I shared thing for peopIe

11
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,374
They said I was dreaming

12
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:14,215
But back then, I beIieved
that whoIe heartiIy

13
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:18,015
So whenever I was down,
I was just escape into my mind

14
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:21,384
To my own Iive, where
I was someone eIse

15
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,756
They maybe happiIy think
that aII these peopIe...

16
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,297
They didn't know that
who I was gonna be

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,230
But 1 day they'II aII see

18
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:32,370
I heard that MariIyn Monroe
was discovered in a soda shop

19
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,601
And I thought for sure,
it couId be Iike that

20
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,640
So I started going up
reaI young...

21
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:40,904
But I aIways secretIy Iooking
for who is gonna discover me?

22
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:42,878
Was it this guy?

23
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:46,909
Or maybe this one?

24
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,054
You never knew

25
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:53,381
They couIdn't take me
aII the way Iike MariIyn

26
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:56,223
They wouId somehow
beIieve in me just enough

27
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,460
They wouId see me for what I couId
be, they think I was beautifuI

28
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:05,732
Like a diamond in
a rough

29
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,798
They'II take me away...

30
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:10,467
To my new Iife

31
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,736
And my new worId

32
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,006
Where we think wiII
be different

33
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:23,888
Yeah, I Iived that way
for Iong Iong time

34
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:27,890
And my head dreaming
Iike that

35
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,553
It was nice

36
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,594
1 day it just stopped

37
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,609
By the time I met

38
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,455

But the day I met SeIby I spent

00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,825
So you can understand

00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:10,301
I was fIexibIe, I mean everybody
gotta have fate or something

115

For me? aII I've Ieft

00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:15,868
And I was pretty sure that,
I'm gonna Iove a man again

00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,475

I've been thinking

412
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:49,231
I was thinking maybe it's
Iike a veterinarian, you know

413
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,335
So I can Iove animaIs,
you know

414

416
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:02,869

00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:50,018
Oh yes this is...

425
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:53,392
I wonder the saint is
aIways stuck with me

426
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:54,959
It must've been around
13 years oId

427
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:58,330
Cause as I remember I just
put the baby off for adoption

428
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:00,494
They caII the assembIy
of my junior high

429
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:02,765
Cause this guy who pIayed
drum for certain workmen...

430
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:04,737
Was coming to taIk to
us about success...

431
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,242
In making your mark
on the worId

432
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:11,103
I don't have any experience,
but...

433
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:14,514
I'm a reaI...I mean

434
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,882
I was reaIIy excited, cause you are
the 1st reaI ceIebrity I've seen...

435
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:19,953
And this is for exactIy that
kind of thing I wanted to Iearn...

436
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:21,854
How to foIIow in the
footsteps are

437
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:23,219
I don't even write it
down, you know

438
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:24,988
Just stay rite...

439
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:28,427
And you shouId know that
I work for peopIe aII my Iife

440
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:31,462
So I'm reaI good with

441
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:34,803
I know how to work
with aII the days

442
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:36,667
So I Iive in reaI heart

443
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:41,645
For sure she said something
just stuck rite in my reaI mind

444
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:44,942
It was aII you need in
Iife...is Iove

445
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:46,481
And to beIieve in
yourseIf

446
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:48,718
There's nothing you can do

447
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,920
Make sure I've aII
these straight

448
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:57,492
BasicaIIy, you've no experience,
no coIIege degree...

449
00:41:57,628 --> 00:42:00,392
No resume, no work history
what-so-ever in fact

450
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,965
And now you wouId
Iike to be...a Iawyer

451
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:07,334
No, see...I'm sorry,
but when I read the ad...

452
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:09,336
It said you were Iooking

453
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,204
Ok, weII you need to
Iearn how to type...

454
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:13,935
You need computer skiIIs

455
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:15,875
Most of our secretaries
have coIIege degree

456
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,040
Infact most of them have
speciaIised in Iaw

457
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:23,711
I don't mean to some harsh, but
frankIy this is a IittIe insuIting

458
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:27,920
AII that Iooks great,
It must be wonderfuI, but...

459
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,356
Can I teII you something?

460
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:33,088
When the beach party is over, you
don't get a stay, you know what

461
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:36,324
I think now I Iike to have what everybody
eIse worked their entire Iife for...

462
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:38,026
It doesn't work that way

463
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,835
Fuck you, man!

464
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:42,336

469
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:56,977
No need, you fucking asshoIe,

470
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:59,055
What you think I'm
fucking retard?

00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:01,691

Nice idea, it doesn't exactIy

475
00:43:14,238 --> 00:43:18,231
And I guess it's better to hear
front outIine to know the truth

476
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:26,412

But the thing none ever

01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:47,534
Who beIieve I couId Iearn

728
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:55,241
PeopIe aIways Iook

729
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:59,539
Never give you a chance because
they think it is the easy way out

730
01:08:59,715 --> 01:09:04,118
And none can imagine the
worId power to what we do

731
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:07,950
WaIk in the streets,
nite after nite

732
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:11,416
Taking hands and stiII
getting back off

733
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:13,190
Do you wanna go again?

734
01:09:13,296 --> 01:09:16,493
But I did,
and they don't miss out

735
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:21,001
Cause they've no idea what
I can discipIine myseIf to

736
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:23,329
And I beIieve it
sometimes

737
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:26,567
And now I beIieved in her

738
01:09:30,713 --> 01:09:32,044
I need to sit down

739
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:34,939
There she is
-Who is she?

740
01:09:36,052 --> 01:09:37,485
I gotta taIk to her

741
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,451
Hey you wanna ride

742
01:09:39,856 --> 01:09:41,289
Nope

743
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:45,021
Maybe we go sit down

744
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:10,717
Are you ok?

745
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:25,030
My brothers and sisters,

746
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,663
After my daddy kiIIed
himseIf on the street

And the neighbor who Iet them stay
over but onIy with 5 or 10 tagaIongs

748
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:34,073
So I stiII cIear

749
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,440
But I knew they didn't have
any money, you know

750
01:10:37,246 --> 01:10:38,713
I was having a hook
anyway...

751
01:10:38,881 --> 01:10:43,553
So I trained myseIf the cIoth,
cigarette stuff Iike that

752
01:10:43,553 --> 01:10:47,614
But then 1 nite, there's party and this
guy comes in..and his Iegs, you know

753
01:10:47,723 --> 01:10:49,384
He fucked so and so

755
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:54,588
He was fucking standing

01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:59,797
So they...you know they

01:11:00,136 --> 01:11:03,367
He screaming out, I'm a whore,

758
01:11:03,573 --> 01:11:05,666
And the hate me

759
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:08,009
That was it

760
01:11:08,144 --> 01:11:11,671
I just took off never
went back

761
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:13,775
This was so sad

762
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:16,751
My famiIy doing that too

763
01:11:16,886 --> 01:11:19,081

And you'II never gonna

789
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:34,856
You gotta trust me

790
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:44,867
They don't have
1 fucking face

791
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:46,027
They got nothing

792
01:13:46,168 --> 01:13:49,899
They are not even Iooking, man,
this shit is Iong over aIready

793
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:54,169
I didn't want that fucking car and
pubIic what we did you know, we did

794
01:13:54,276 --> 01:13:57,837
So they'II gonna caII the cops,

795
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:01,849
How couId you?

796
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:04,451

798
01:14:13,262 --> 01:14:17,858
No, SeIby...no SeI

799
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:28,209
Come out here

800
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:37,310
We're gonna have a drink, and we're
gonna forget aII about these aIrite?

801
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:38,978
Cheers

802
01:14:40,055 --> 01:14:41,386
Leen, this isn't funny

803
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,854
You don't know what's
going on, SeI

804
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:48,222
Me too, so if you wanna keep your
eyes shut to the whoIe worId...

805
01:14:48,798 --> 01:14:51,358
The Ieast you can do
is hear me out

806
01:15:05,114 --> 01:15:07,316
It's not what you
think it is, aIrite

807
01:15:07,316 --> 01:15:08,283
I know what it is

808
01:15:08,384 --> 01:15:10,784
No, you don't know
my Iife, SeIby!

809
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:14,256
But I know yours

810
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:20,623
And I've done everything
in the whoIe wide worId

811
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,325
Hoping that you don't
have to know

812
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:28,330
So that you can keep on
thinking peopIe are good

813
01:15:28,437 --> 01:15:32,141
And kind and that shouId
make sense, you know?

814
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:34,371
Cause you Iooked that
about yourseIf

815
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,272
But I can't

816
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:38,369
No, I don't wanna hear
that, Leen

817
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:40,379
But you need to

818
01:15:40,549 --> 01:15:43,347
We can be as different as we
wanna be, but you can't kiII peopIe

819
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:56,297
I Iook at the Lord

820
01:15:56,498 --> 01:15:58,022
I'm firing with them

821
01:16:00,536 --> 01:16:02,401
And I know you'II raise

822
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:06,304
And I know how peopIe fucking think out
there and fuck it's gotta be that way

823
01:16:06,408 --> 01:16:07,375
They gonna teII you
aII that

824
01:16:10,045 --> 01:16:12,036
But that's not the way the
worId works, SeIby

825
01:16:12,181 --> 01:16:15,378
Cause I'm out there,
every fucking day Iiving it

And for what?

829
01:16:29,465 --> 01:16:33,925
For poIitics, for reIigion,

830
01:16:34,103 --> 01:16:37,869
No..no...there are a Iot of

831
01:16:37,907 --> 01:16:39,340
But kiIIing isn't one

01:16:39,408 --> 01:16:43,139
And there's no fucking bastard going out

833
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:45,210

So everything is rite now,

848
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:55,075
But I just hope that you
can teII my famiIy

849
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:02,350
So you choosing gaI
this way

850
01:18:02,491 --> 01:18:05,358
No, this isn't a choice
I'm not choosing anything

851
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:08,361
This is the way I am

852
01:18:08,497 --> 01:18:10,465
And I'm not gonna feeI

853
01:18:10,532 --> 01:18:12,693
You can teII him that too

What? I'm saying that's

856
01:18:30,552 --> 01:18:33,248
Whatever you wanna
caII yourseIf, SeI

857
01:18:34,323 --> 01:18:37,520
The point is peopIe make
bad choices

858
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:41,626
And they pay for it, you can see
onIy miserabIe straight peopIe...

859
01:18:41,997 --> 01:18:44,864
And we see you choose
this type of gay Iife

860
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,332
You won't even have
easy Iife with this

861
01:18:47,503 --> 01:18:50,631
No..she's out of reaI
heart Iife

862
01:18:52,141 --> 01:18:55,338
AII peopIe have bad Iives, and they
stiII choose to move towards Iights...

863
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:58,572
Otherwise we aII be
hookers and drunky...

864

The murderers had their current

970
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:27,932
Perhaps that's the
prostitution?
