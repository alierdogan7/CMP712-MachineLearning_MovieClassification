Here's a hundred bucks to start with.

1232
02:03:20,985 --> 02:03:22,611
Can't I get a job instead?

1233
02:03:23,195 --> 02:03:24,362
A job?

1234
02:03:26,699 --> 02:03:27,949

1235
02:03:28,034 --> 02:03:29,409
I can clean.

1236
02:03:30,995 --> 02:03:35,957
I ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid,
so get it out of your goddamn head!

1237
02:03:36,042 --> 02:03:39,544

02:04:00,775 --> 02:04:02,275
But he's dead.

1241
02:04:03,361 --> 02:04:07,155
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

[ SPEAKING ITALIAN ]

1243
02:04:08,616 --> 02:04:11,576
Now take this money
and get the hell out of here.

1244
02:04:11,661 --> 02:04:13,745
And don't let me see
your face till next month,

1245
02:04:13,829 --> 02:04:17,916

I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1246

died in a car accident four weeks ago.

1248
02:05:20,020 --> 02:05:21,646
It was terrible.

1249
02:05:24,275 --> 02:05:27,193
You know, we didn't have the time
to get to know one another

1250
02:05:27,278 --> 02:05:29,320
when you first came here,

1251
02:05:29,405 --> 02:05:32,949
but I want you to know that
I'm not the kind of woman who'd let down a child,

1252
02:05:33,033 --> 02:05:36,035
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

1253
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:40,874
So I'm going to help you and
do my best to welcome you here again.

1254
02:05:43,252 --> 02:05:45,003
But on one condition.

1255
02:05:45,671 --> 02:05:48,298
You have to stop lying to me, Mathilda.

1256
02:05:49,341 --> 02:05:52,719
I want you to take a chance
and trust me.

1257
02:05:54,054 --> 02:05:56,514
Now, tell me what happened to you.

1258
02:05:57,725 --> 02:05:58,725
Okay.

1259
02:06:00,561 --> 02:06:05,023
My family got shot down by DEA officers
because of a drug problem.

1260
02:06:07,193 --> 02:06:09,611
I lived with the greatest guy on Earth.

1261
02:06:09,695 --> 02:06:14,365
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

1262
02:06:14,658 --> 02:06:17,869
And if you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

1264
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:41,392
