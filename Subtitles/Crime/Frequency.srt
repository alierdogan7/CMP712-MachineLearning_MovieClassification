01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:52,917
When?

836
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:57,338
October 22nd, 1969.

837
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:01,300
That's now, Johnny. That's next week.

838
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:04,386
How...? You gotta tell me how.

839
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,265
- She was murdered.
- Murdered? What are you talking about?

840
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:12,061
Listen to me. There was this case,
a serial. They never caught him.

841
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:16,523
But he murdered three women, all nurses,
between '68 and '69.

842
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,108
They call him the Nightingale.

843
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,527
Nightingale?
We've been watching that on the news.

844
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,906
- I was worried about your mother.
She said... - Dad, we did something.

845
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,407
Something to make it worse.

846
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,995
- I don't understand.
- He didn't just kill three women anymore.

847
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,165
He's killed 10.
Something we did changed the past.

848
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,376
- But how come your mother...?
- Think about it.

849
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:39,546
Everything you did is different than if
you'd never gotten out of that warehouse.

850
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,840
Now, what did you do last night, Dad?

851
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:46,804
I talked to you, I put you on the bike...

852
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:51,183
...I tucked you in at Gordo's and I went
to see your mother over at the hospital.

853
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,685
Oh, shit.

854
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,271
That's it.
She wasn't supposed to be there.

855
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,440
Butch got her. It was the night
of the fire. He brought her home.

856
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,318
- Something happened at the hospital?
- That's the beginning.

857
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:05,281
It could've been anywhere, place, time
that she wouldn't have been if you'd died.

858
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,200
I'll take her away from here.
I have to take her away from...

859
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:11,370
- He cannot hurt her if I take her away.
- What about the others?

860
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,914
What about the others, Dad?

861
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:17,001
- I'll warn them. - It'll never
work. They'll think you're crazy.

862
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:20,462
But I gotta do something. You
don't even know what this guy looks like.

863
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,049
- You don't know who he is.
- No, because nobody got any...

864
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,427
Hold on. Wait a minute.

865
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,055
Dad, I may not know who he is...

866
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:34,059
...but I know where he's gonna be and what
he's gonna do before he gets there.

867
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,062
What do I do? Call the police?
They're not gonna believe me.

868
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:40,566
They will if they catch him in the act.
You can make that happen.

869
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,026
No, Johnny. I don't know.

870
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,946
- I don't know. I'm a firefighter, not
a cop. - I'm a cop. This is what I do.

871
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,740
This is something we have to do.

If the ham stops working?

873
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,328
- If I can't reach you?
- Get Mom the hell out.

874
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:56,206
But, Dad, those other women
were not supposed to die.

875
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,709
If we don't do something to try
to stop this guy...

876
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,837
...we're gonna have to live with that
for the rest of our lives.

877
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,673
Okay.

878
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,092
- Okay, tell me what to do.
- All right.

879

The next victim is Carrie Reynolds.
It happens tomorrow.

880

she left the Roosevelt Hospital at 6...

881
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,393
...showed up at Cozy's Bar around 6:30...

882
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,313
...she walked out of that bar
around 7:30...

883
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:23,442
...and they found her dead
in an alley behind the bar at 8:00.

884
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:27,279
I want you to follow her, see if anybody's
watching her or hitting on her...

885
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,115
...because I'm betting
when she walks out of that place...

886
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,117
...somebody's gonna come out with her.

887
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,828
