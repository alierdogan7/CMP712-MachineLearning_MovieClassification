Why would he be?

184
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:52,195
When was, if I may, the last
time you spoke with your son?

185
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,139
Do you know
a Herbert Spirakis?

186
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,736
No.

187
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,643
He's also an investigator
here. Very professional.

188
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,675
He says I have a case.

189
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,344
Mrs. Bessolo, I'm gonna
level with you, all right?

190
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:19,083
LAPD, Los Angeles Police Department,
they don't like to be shown up.

191
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,127
Okay, they've already
closed the door on your son.

192
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,855
It's a suicide. End of story.

193
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,925
You want that door open again?

194
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,990
You want to make the cops
and the DA pay attention?

195
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,370
You need a headline this big,
only with the truth.

196
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,210
So that everybody knows. Okay?
You got to shove it in their faces.

197
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,108
Did Herbert Spirakis
tell you that?

198
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,613

to see? Lana Turner's guy...

sticking out of his ass.

What'd he do, beat himself
up before he shot himself?

I don't know.

213
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,713
Don't do that. Hey.

you could touch anything.

Don't worry about it.

hurt me.

00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,645
Cause your expiration.

696
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,824
He won't be buried
in that cape.

697
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,099
Mrs. Bessolo,
RKO-Pathe would be honored

698
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:25,107
to help you pay for
any sort of a floral tribute

699
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,305
that you might deem
appropriate for your son.

700
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,687
Since when do suicides miss twice,
lay down a rug and start over?

701
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,487
Is that normal? Just asking.

702
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:47,954
That cost the studio 15 grand.

703
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,726
You think you're worth that?

704
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,156
We were just...

705
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,033
This Farmer's Daughter
picture. What is it?

706
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,797
HOWARD: The Mating Game.

707
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,569
EDDIE:
A million-dollar investment.

708
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,007
You think I'm going to let you
fuck with that?

709
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,568
You think you're
gonna be a star?

710
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:04,773
HOWARD: Our concern here is...
You're a face.

711
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,274
Faces change.

712
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,612
What Mr. Mannix means...

713
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,915
He knows what I mean.
Out of my sight.

714
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,293
Set something up.

715
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:25,029
Him and some starlet.

716
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,998
Picnic, soda pop.

717
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,506
Already arranged.

718
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,237
They treat their
contract like shit, Howard.

719
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,441
Whatever the fuck they want.

720
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,511
The business is changing.

721
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,279
Fags and television.

722
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,692
And what are we, huh?

723
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,185
The Last of the Mohicans.

724
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,622
That was a UA picture, Eddie.

725
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,837
That spic,

726
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,640
wop, prick detective.

727
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,142
I sent
Jim Engelmann over.

728
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,737
He used to work for us. I'm sure you
don't want MGM coming into it.

729
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,311
And?

730
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,508
Louis Simo.

731
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,879
Two years
with Rick Harris.

732
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,084
He shot his mouth off
about Susan Humphries

733
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:21,351
to Confidential for $5,000.
Harris fired him.

734
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,983
Susan Humphries?

735
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,186
Jennifer Jones type.

736
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,991
Under contract at Fox.
Heroin addict.

737
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:30,189
Drove off Topanga
doing 90.

738
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,529
You have a good memory,
Eddie.

739
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,330
What's the prick want?

740
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,929
Money. Press.
Whatever he can grab.

741
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:41,009
What's he got?

742
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,272
Some questions.

743
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,725
My wife
won't get out of bed.

744
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:04,397
It's been almost a week,
she won't get out.

745
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,958
I'll stop by and see her.

746
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,537
Do that. Cheer her up.

747
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,940
She always liked you.

748
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,909
Eddie.
Yeah?

749
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,311
You have anything
to tell me?

750
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,610
About what?

751
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:23,743
Anything I need to
have a story ready for.

752
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,896
She's not here.

753
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,057
Miss Lemmon?

754
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,660
That's interesting.

755
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,792
What is?

756
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:43,162
That you thought I wanted to talk
to her, since this is your house.

757
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,078
Is that your father?

758
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,839
My husband.

759
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,385
Oh, sorry.

760
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,688
He's a screenwriter.

761
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,825
Well, no one could blame you for wanting
to hang around people your own age.

762
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,453
What was his name again?
Robert Condon?

763
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,099
I'm sure you're just friends.

764
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,666
Around back.

765
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,947
You really ought to
prune these.

766
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:33,416
My husband does the gardening.
It takes his mind off his writing.

767
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,419
Well, what do you do,
Mrs. Van Ronkel?

768
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,893
I don't go around trying to
get my picture in the paper.

769
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:42,727
You saw that, huh?

770
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:46,096
What are you going to do when
this blows up in your face?

771
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:51,136
There are two holes in the bedroom
floor. What do you know about that?

772
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,102
Leonore made them.
Yeah?

773
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,201
Months ago.
Why?

774
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,244
I asked her to.

775
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,805
You asked her
to shoot a gun in the floor.

776
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,484
When you're drunk,
everything's funny.

777
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:08,154
He shoots himself, you all wait
45 minutes to call the police.

778
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,817
That's unusual.

779
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:13,390
You ever been to a party where a man
goes upstairs and blows his head off?

780
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,725
No.

781
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,265
Then how do you know
what's unusual?

782
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,760
So how do I find
Miss Lemmon?

783
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,169
She's not the way
you think she is.

784
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,834
Yeah?
What way is she?

785
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,742
She was only
looking for love.

786
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,680
I just want to remember
that one. That's good.

787
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,854
That's nice,
it's very futuristic.

788
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,196
Hey, you're a detective,
right?

789
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,356
Yeah.

790
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:52,868
So, men hire you to find out what their
wives are up to, that sort of thing?

791
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,334
Yeah, they do that.

792
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,830
Does the truth
make them happier?

793
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,266
Hardly ever.

794
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:06,240
You know, he wasn't
going to marry her.

795
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,141
Reeves?
Mmm-hmm.

796
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:10,646
How do you know?

797
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,314
Oh, she ran over here
when he told her.

798
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,918
I heard every word.

799
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,662
And how did
Miss Lemmon react?

800
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,533
Like a longshoreman
on a bender.

I am tired of you treating it
like a goddamn bus station.

Woe is fucking me.

I haul myself out
to this shithole burg for you,

812
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,090
and you have the balls
to tell me it's off?

813
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,762
God damn it. Listen,
what are you doing?

814
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:38,130

This is

Last I looked, it was $4,000
in traveler's cheques.

824
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,034
Georgie put it aside
for our honeymoon.

That's off the plate now,
isn't it?

00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,097

D'Artagnan, you couldn't nail me
with roses and a trip to Vegas.

834
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,371
And you're not a cop.

835
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:30,910
So what the hell are you doing following
me into my dead fiancé's bedroom?

Not unless
you dope me first.

See how I got us in the paper?
Look at this.

842
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,073
Guaranteed,
LAPD is going to sweat this.

843
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,587
Now, the more heat they feel, the more
pressure they're under to reopen the case.

844
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,715
The police reopened the case?
No.

845
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,927
They will
if I keep it up.

846
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,485
Which requires a financial
commitment from you

847
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:22,656
so I can go on hammering.

848
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,199
I did get a copy of the
police report. Lots of holes.

849
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,500
And I'm not talking about
the ones in the floor.

850
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:35,066
Plus, something else. Your
son called the wedding off.

851
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,639
That's a new motive
for Miss Lemmon, okay?

852
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:41,309
And I intend to go... She was
never going to be his wife.

853
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,750
Oh, yeah? You knew
that he didn't plan on...

854
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,981
Do you think my own son would
get married without telling me?

855
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,650
And to a greedy slut
like that?

856
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,991
All these people...

857
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:01,831
What about them?

858
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,169
They're sitting around
like they're so big.

859
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,436
I don't know who they are.

with Gable.

can do that, you know.

Does this offend
your delicate sensibilities?

866
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:36,997
Yes.

867
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,974
But you're new on the job,

868
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:47,510
Art got a call.
They're picking up Superman.

00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,279
They're what?

870
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,014
Kellogg's. They bought it.

871
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,913
After two years?
That's right.

872
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:58,150
I will be
on television in a month.

873
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,186

Well, maybe it wasn't
your proudest moment.

877
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,203
No, I'm quite sure
it wasn't.

878
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:16,541
But you did create a very likeable,
very attractive, very heroic character.

879
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,343
Is that right?

880
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,007
I'd fuck you
in a second.

881
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,786
Well, one thing
we can be sure of.

882
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,378
No one with a lick of sense
would watch that show.

Superman was on pain pills.

911
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,110
So he crashed his car
a couple of months back.

912

Almost got killed.
Drunk?

913

I went down to the Esso station

I said I was from the insurance
company. I spoke to a Mr. Phelps.

917
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,356
He was very friendly.

918
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,457
Leak in the lining?

919
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,537
Mr. Phelps couldn't find one.
Not bad, huh?

920
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:33,336
But they were still getting married,
at least then, as far as she knew.

Well, wouldn't that
be why?

922
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,880
Why Leonore drains
his brake fluid?

923
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,210
Why Mrs. Mannix does.

For this younger woman.
