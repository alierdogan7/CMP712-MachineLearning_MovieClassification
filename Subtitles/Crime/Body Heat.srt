- That's where we're at, isn't it?
- What do you mean?

345
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,940
That's what we're thinking.
How good it would be...

346
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,192
...if he was gone.
It would be real sweet.

347
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,029
No, Ned, please. Don't.
Don't talk about it.

348
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,239
Talk is dangerous,
it makes things happen.

349
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,658
- It makes them real.
- Don't let it scare you.

350
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,827
Because he's not gonna die.

351
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,497
Nothing wrong with him, is there?
No reason to think he's gonna die?

352
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,957
- No.
- That's right.

353

to make things nice for us.

you'll come out all right.

- Of a divorce?
- Yeah, he's ripe.

358
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,086
No. I signed a prenuptial agreement.

359
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,506
- What?
- He insisted.

360
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,174
He blamed it on his sister Roz.

361
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,511
She's always hated me,
but I know he wanted it too.

362
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,347
- How is it?
- It's bad.

00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,850
I get some money for a year,
not much. That's it.

Does it matter, Ned?
Tell me the truth, please.

365
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:16,363
The truth.
I had wished you were gonna be loaded.

366
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,283
Does it matter? No.

- What is it again? What?
- Rover.

380
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:50,415
- It's between first and second.
- Rover. That's not a shortstop?

381
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,460
No. The shortstop
is between second and third.

382
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,503
Oh, good, that's the way I remember it.

383

You have a good time.

...and eat here once a month

didn't make very much...

were too slimy for me.

01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,086
I don't think you know Mrs. Kraft.

676
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:28,340
No, I don't.

677
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,134
My condolences.

678
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,844
Thank you.

679
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:41,686
Mrs. Walker, I am very sorry
about your husband.

680
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,021
Thank you, Mr. Racine.

681
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,398
You know Mr. Lowenstein.

682
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,068
- Hello, Peter.
- Hi.

683
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,617
I've asked Mr. Lowenstein
to join us...

684
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,746
...because he's handling the inquiry
into Edmund Walker's death...

685
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,540
...for the county prosecutor's office.

686
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,459
He and I have discussed this matter...

687
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,629
...and he has made it possible
for us to speak very frankly here.

688
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,382
Off the record, so to speak.

689
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:15,136
As I've told Mrs. Walker, I was surprised
at the existence of this new will.

690
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,723
Edmund hadn't mentioned
anything about it to me.

691
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:22,644
Mrs. Walker explained that when she and
her husband decided to make changes...

692
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,564
...they took care of it up here
for simplicity's sake.

693
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,609
As you know, the new will
is almost identical to the old...

694
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,278
...but for the disposition
of a few items.

695
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,072
At the risk of oversimplifying...

696
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,659
...the thrust of the will is to divide
the estate in almost equal parts...

697
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,745
...between Heather Kraft
and Mrs. Walker.

698
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,665
Would you agree
with that assessment, Mr. Racine?

699
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:49,170
Yes, well, you witnessed
Edmund Walker's signature...

700
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:53,800
...along with this
Miss Mary Ann Simpson.

701
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,721
Apparently, it will be impossible for us
to contact Miss Simpson.

702
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,306
MATTY:
Mary Ann is a lifelong friend of mine.

703
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:04,519
She was visiting on her way to Europe.
When she returns, she'll be in touch.

704
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,438
NED:
Although it's really not required.

705
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:09,232
Witnesses of the signing
are not commonly available...

706
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,944
...when the will is entered into probate.
It's not standard, by any means.

707
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:16,072
HARDIN: Edmund Walker's death
was not standard.

708
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:17,991
Pardon me, I'm confused.

709
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:21,327
Is there some question
as to the authenticity of the will?

710
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:22,954
I'm confused too.

711
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,749
You have a problem with the witnessing
or the signatures?

712
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,751
What are you getting at?

713
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:28,960
HARDIN:
No.

714
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,088
I'm afraid the problem lies elsewhere.

715
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:36,634
Would anybody mind if I smoked?

716
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:53,151
No, I don't need my own.
I'll just breathe the air.

717
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,161
HARDIN:
Everything's in order up to there.

718
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,748
The problem comes in the language
of the bequest to Heather.

719
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,833
It's a technical matter.

720
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,503
In writing the will,
I'm afraid Mr. Racine violated...

721
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,964
...what's known as
"the rule against perpetuities."

722
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:19,594
It forbids an inheritance to be passed
down indefinitely for generations.

723
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:23,515
I knew that a probate judge in Miami
would spot the mistake right away...

724
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,018
...so I thought I'd bring it up here
to Okeelanta County...

725
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,062
...since Edmund
had the residence here...

726
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,322
...and see if I could get lucky
with a judge...

727
01:08:31,323 --> 01:08:33,274
...who didn't know estate law
quite so well.

728
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:37,237
Perhaps find one with the same
kind of training as Mr. Racine.

729
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:40,448
Unfortunately, my plan backfired.

730
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:45,036
I ran into a judge who had had
other dealings with Mr. Racine...

731
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,080
...a Judge Costanza.

732
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:50,708
It seems there were problems
with an estate in a case four years ago.

733
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,961
Very different problems, it's true...

734
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:56,673
...but on a will that Mr. Racine
prepared. It was quite a mess.

735
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,217
Accusations of carelessness,
a malpractice suit.

736
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,136
I think he called it
the Gourson case.

737
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,679
PETER:
Gourson.

738
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:07,058
Once again, Mr. Hardin, you've lost me.

739
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,602
Yes, what does this all mean?

740
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,397
It means, I'm afraid,
that Edmund's will is invalid.

741
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:16,943
Edmund Walker died intestate,
as though there were no will at all.

742
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:19,737
So, what happens now?

743
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,656
HARDIN:
You don't know?

744
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,284
No, I don't.

745
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,661
HARDIN: Perhaps Mr. Racine
would like to tell you.

746
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:32,292
In Florida,
when a person dies without a will...

747
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,879
...and there are no children
or surviving parents...

748
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,843
...then the spouse inherits everything.

749
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,681
My God.

750
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,018
You mean, it's all mine?

751
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,271
Though that was clearly not
your husband's intention.

752
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,607
My God.

753
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:58,902
HARDIN:
He intended Heather to benefit.

754
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:03,031
Oh.

755
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,532
Of course.

756
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,326
Of course, I understand.

757
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,620
Of course.

758
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:18,004
You look good in black.

759
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:22,467
I've missed you so badly.
I need you.

760
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:25,762
I couldn't figure out how you got
my stationery. Then it came to me.

761
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,057
Edmund's signature must have been a snap.
I wouldn't challenge mine.

762
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,477
Please stop. I don't blame you
for hating me right now.

763
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:37,857
You have really done it, Matty.
You really have.

764
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,486
Will you come to the house tonight?

765
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:53,289
I want you more right now
than I ever have.

766
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:58,461
I know how you must feel,
but please come tonight.

767
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:02,048
I hope you haven't done us in.

768
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:44,882
Hi, guys.

769
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,511
Just come on in.
Make yourself at home.

770
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,013
OSCAR: Sorry about that.
PETER: Not me.

771
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,350
Door was unlocked, inviting illegal entry.
Behavior like that makes Oscar's job hard.

772
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:56,394
Sorry, Oscar. You guys want a beer?

773
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,229
No, thank you. I already had one.

774
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:03,151
Ned, how in the fuck did you ever
get involved with this Matty Walker?

775
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:07,280
- What do you mean?
OSCAR: I mean, she's poison.

776
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,490
Tell me what you know
about his death.

777
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,243
What I read. He died in the fire.
Looks like arson.

778
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,745
Was arson.

779
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,788
Okay, it was arson.

780
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:18,166
Don't know if he was setting it
and fucked up...

781
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,585
...or if that's just what
somebody wanted it to look like.

782
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,254
Oh, he didn't set it.
Somebody offed him.

783
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,299
NED:
His people owned the place, right?

784
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,092
OSCAR:
That's right.

785
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,845
And a very rough group of fellows too.

786
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,640
Possible they wanted to cut Edmund out,
but it doesn't seem like...

787
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:37,101
...a very neat way
to handle something like that.

788
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:41,272
No, it's not their style. They're smooth.
They'd rather destroy you than kill you.

789
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,107
And they hate publicity.

790
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:46,235
OSCAR: I'm more interested
in the grieving widow.

791
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:48,446
PETER: Her sister-in-law
has ideas along that line.

792
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,865
She could barely contain herself today.

793
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,450
I noticed that.

794
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:55,620
But she wants to wait and see how
Matty treats her on the estate.

795
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,623
- Doesn't want to blow it.
- How did you get involved?

796
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:03,961
They asked me to redo the will.
I met with her and Edmund.

797
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,630
It was pretty simple.

798
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,465
[CHUCKLING]

799
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,718
Miss Mary Ann Simpson
witnessed it with me.

800
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,137
Walker didn't seem to think
it was any big deal.

801
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,807
OSCAR: That's it?
- That's it.

802
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,226
- What was Simpson's story?
NED: I don't know.

803
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:21,979
She was just passing through.
Old friend of the family's. Good-looking.

804
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,564
On her way to Europe?

805
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,861
The passport people
didn't have any record of it.

806
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,281
What do you think?

807
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,867
About the wife.

808
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:42,458
I suppose it's possible. I don't know much
about her except what I've seen.

809
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,836
It wouldn't shock me anyway.

810
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,004
PETER:
I have this feeling she's very bad news.

811
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,841
Take some incredibly intelligent advice.
Stay away from her.

812
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,844
He's right, for once.

813
01:13:57,182 --> 01:13:59,851
Well, I'm sorry, guys.

814
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,019
I just can't do that.

815
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,439
Why not?

816
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:08,234
NED: Well, for one thing,
did you get a look at her?

817
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,321
That wouldn't be so meaningful,
except today she started coming on to me...

818
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:15,324
...and that lady is about to come into
a great deal of money.

819
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:19,537
Fact is, she invited me out there tonight
and I'm going, and I'm gonna keep going...

820
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,248
...as many days or nights...

821
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,293
...or weekends as she'll have me.

822
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:30,756
Ned, someday your dick is gonna
lead you into a very big hassle.

823
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:32,717
That lady may have killed her husband.

824
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,386
Peter, she's not gonna inherit anything
by killing me.

825
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:39,223
Besides, maybe she'll try
to fuck me to death.

826
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:50,318
You've messed up before
and you'll mess up again. It's your nature.

827
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:55,156
But they've always been small-time.
This might not be.

828
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,910
She's trouble, Ned. The real thing,
big-time, major-league trouble.

829
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,662
Watch yourself.

830
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:13,257
MATTY: Mary Ann and I left Wheaton
together and went to Chicago.

831
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,009
We didn't know what we were doing.

832
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:19,347
I got into bad trouble with drugs. Speed.

833
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,265
Real bad.

834
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,643
I did things that...

835
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,438
Worse than you can imagine.

836
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,816
I thought I would die. I prayed I would.

837
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,904
And then a man helped me.

838
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:36,781
He got me clean.

839
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:39,659
He didn't want much in return, either.

840
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:44,455
He was a lawyer. He put me to work
in his office. I learned a lot there.

841
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,211
That's where I picked up the business
about making a will invalid.

842
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,296
It happened to him.

843
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:57,635
I swear I never would have used you
if I had known about your case.

844
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:02,014
I was afraid to tell you.

845
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,934
I knew you wouldn't let me do it.

846
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:08,646
I'm greedy, like you said.
I wanted us to have it all.

847
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,484
I don't blame you...

848
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,987
...for thinking I'm bad.

849
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:19,073
I am. I know it.

850
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:23,119
I'd understand
if you cut me off right now.

851
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,664
If you never trusted me again,
you'd probably be smart...

852
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:30,084
...but you must believe one thing.

853
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,587
I love you.

854
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:37,133
I love you and I need you.

855
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,052
And I want to be with you forever.

856
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:46,851
They already think you're involved.

857
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:49,228
I don't care.

858
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,773
Great.

859
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,694
There's nothing we can do about it now.

860
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:00,323
In a little while,
we'll either have the money or we won't.

861
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:02,450
It's out of our hands.

862
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,705
I fired the housekeeper.

863
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,500
We can stay together
as long as we want.

864
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,253
We're all alone now.

865
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:44,950
That's right,
I've been going down there a lot lately.

866
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:48,871
Isn't that amazing? Miami. Jesus.

867
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:55,753
I'm handling the purchases and property
down there.

868
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,506
I'll be going back again in the future
if that's okay...

869
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,050
...if it's still legal to go to Miami.

870
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:03,177
- He's mad.
- I'm not. Why should I be mad...

871
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:07,223
...because my friend here wants to know my
whereabouts the night of a recent murder?

872
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:10,393
It's not so recent anymore.
Maybe he's feeling a bit of pressure.

873
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,061
OSCAR:
You brought this on yourself.

874
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:15,147
I don't run this department.
There are people are watching this.

875
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:17,441
They hear you're out there
banging the widow...

876
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:20,194
...it tends to call attention to you.

877
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,446
So don't give me that shit.

878
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:24,115
That is my business.

879
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:26,534
You mean, that's your fucking business.

880
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:30,371
This whole damn case is getting crazy.

881
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,332
- You tell him about the glasses?
- No.

882
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,334
Seems that Walker always wore glasses.

883
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:38,045
Steel-rimmed glasses.
A real fanatic about them.

884
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:41,257
They were not on the scene.
Coroner says they should have been...

885
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:44,677
...that even after the fire, the frames
would have been seared right into his...

886
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,388
Ech. You don't wanna hear the details.

887
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,640
So what?

888
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:52,101
It's looking like
he was killed somewhere else...

889
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,937
...and brought there in his own car.

890
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:58,274
Now, your honey, his wife,
said he left the house in the night...

891
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,985
...driving himself
to some mysterious meeting.

892
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,695
Is that vague enough for you?

893
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:05,740
Look, what is this? What do you want?

894
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:09,160
Am I supposed to be an undercover agent
for you guys or something?

895
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,661
Interesting choice of phrase.

896
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,830
Well, suppose tonight I ask her:

897
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:16,542
"Say, did you kill your husband?
My friends were just wondering."

898
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,335
That's a great idea.

899
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:21,922
While you're at it, ask where
the glasses are, where she did it...

900
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,091
Am I forgetting anything, Oscar?

901
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,010
OSCAR: That one thing.
PETER: Oh, yeah.

902
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,637
You're gonna love this, Ned,
this latest development.

903
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:32,057
This is from the sister-in-law,
the Kraft woman.

904
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:35,853
She's been driving me batty, convinced
she ain't gonna be cut in on the will.

905
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:38,063
It seems a couple weeks
before the murder...

906
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:41,525
...Walker's niece spent a while up here
with your friend Matty.

907
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:45,196
One night, she wakes up,
goes to see her aunt...

908
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,656
...and catches the lady with some guy.

909
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:51,076
PETER: You get it?
In the act or some fucking thing.

910
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:54,371
We don't have all the details yet,
but Mrs. Kraft...

911
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:57,082
...is bringing the little girl today
to tell her story.

912
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,920
Oh, they're here. I passed them
on the way in. They're waiting outside.

913
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:02,713
OSCAR:
Christ.

914
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,883
I'm not sure I'm up to
dealing with this scene.

915
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:09,637
Listen.

916
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,433
You probably don't want to see
the Kraft woman right now.

917
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:19,814
She's pretty wild. So why don't you just
slip out the back way here?

918
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,692
Are we done here?

919
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,655
Yeah, I've got it all here.

920
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:34,662
- Ned, I'm sorry I had to ask.
- I'll go out this way.

921
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,084
I've had a lot of experience
with disgruntled people.

922
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:48,717
I'll be at Stella's.

923
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,104
Hello, Mrs. Kraft.

924
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,523
Hello, Mr. Racine.

925
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,191
How are you making out?

926
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,569
We're doing all right, I guess.

927
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,281
You must be Heather.

928
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:14,159
I'm Ned Racine. I've heard a lot
about you. It's nice to meet you.

929
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:15,870
Thank you.

930
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,748
I'm sorry our town
is so hot for your visit.

931
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:22,209
It sure is.

932
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:25,421
Well, goodbye.

933
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,132
- Bye.
- Bye.

934
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,842
Bye.

935
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:42,897
- The usual, my sweet.
STELLA: Two iced teas for Fred Astaire.

936
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:46,317
Hey, Rosemary,
I'm going out for 10 minutes.

937
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:50,654
- You ready to hear something wild?
- I don't know, I have had my share today.

938
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:53,365
No, no, this is right up your alley.

939
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:01,081
Little Heather...

940
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:04,168
...goes out on the porch
and there's this dude with her aunt.

941
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:07,504
And the guy is turned around
with his pants or shorts dropped...

942
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,673
...so he's mooning the little girl, right?

943
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:13,427
He and your friend are going at something
Heather can't quite figure out...

944
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:17,014
...but which sounds suspiciously to me
like oral-genital contact...

945
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,142
...which, I'm proud to say,
is no longer illegal in this state.

946
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:24,480
And the guy turns around to Heather.
Do you follow me so far?

947
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:27,358
- Guess what he looks like.
- I don't know.

948
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:32,071
Well, he looks about seven or eight inches
long, shiny and very, very bald.

949
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,701
Poor little Heather!

950
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:40,537
She'd never seen one angry before.

951
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:43,540
Made quite an impression on her.
Yes, sirree.

952
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:46,669
- That's the only thing she can remember.
- That's it?

953
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:48,545
No, no.

954
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,465
One other thing.

955
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:55,177
She said the guy had very greasy hair,
wore it slicked back.

956
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,847
"Like a Cuban," she says.
I love that part.

957
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,058
Can you imagine poor little Heather?

958
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,228
After getting a gander at that,
she has to slip back to bed and...

959
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,106
This is the capper,
why she woke up in the first place:

960
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:08,315
She had a nightmare.

961
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:12,444
Can you imagine the kind of dreams she had
for the rest of the night?

962
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,035
Don't say that.
Don't say you don't have them.

963
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:22,413
I swear to you I don't.
What's wrong with you?

964
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,915
They had to be here that night
when you cleaned up.

965
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,418
Think hard. They've probably
got my prints on them.

966
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:30,504
I wasn't looking for them.
I thought they were on Edmund.

967
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,966
- Where could they have gone?
- I don't know.

968
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,303
- Betty.
- The housekeeper?

969
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,472
Where would she have put them?
You've been through his things.

970
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,807
She might have taken them.

971
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,726
Listen to me. That's why I fired her.

972
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:46,770
Because after Edmund's death,
she started acting strangely.

973
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,106
She was watching me,
listening to my calls.

974
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,191
That is crazy. You imagined it.

975
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,485
I know. I've been
imagining things too. Plenty.

976
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:56,447
No. No, I could tell
there was a difference.

977
01:23:56,614 --> 01:24:00,117
Maybe she knew about us.
Maybe she wants something.

978
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,328
Don't you think we would have
heard from her by now?

979
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:05,831
MATTY:
I don't know what to think.

980
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,333
I'm worried, Ned.

981
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:13,464
But it's not about the glasses
or your friends. It's us.

982
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:17,134
Your first reaction is to accuse me.

983
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:20,220
- What's happening to you?
- I'm sorry.

984
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,142
Hardin called today.

985
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:29,271
He said that everything should be cleared
up by next week. I'll get the money.

986
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:31,482
He apologized for the delay.

987
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:34,943
They've been stalling.
They're dragging it out...

988
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,613
...hoping to find a way
to implicate you.

989
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:40,074
But they haven't been able to.

990
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:43,494
Soon, it will be all ours.

991
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:46,830
That's why we've got to
stay together, Ned.

992
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,332
It won't be long...

993
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,169
...and then we can get away from here,
out from under all of this.

994
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,423
All we have is each other.

995
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:01,470
I'd kill myself if I thought
this thing would destroy us.

996
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,265
I couldn't take it.

997
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,693
That's great.

998
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,321
- Hi, Ned.
- What are you doing here?

999
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:45,407
I was looking for you.
Do you always run this late?

1000
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:48,660
No. I'm going down to Miami tomorrow.
I won't have time.

1001
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:52,539
- What's in Miami? - Closing a real
estate deal I was working on.

1002
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,086
You're some kind of health nut.

1003
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:01,798
Matty Walker smokes that same brand,
I noticed.

1004
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:06,053
This gonna be one of those conversations?
Maybe I should have my lawyer present.

1005
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,639
Buddy, your lawyer is present.

1006
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,525
You know, that Edmund Walker
was a bad guy.

1007
01:27:20,693 --> 01:27:23,111
The more I find out,
the happier I am he's dead.

1008
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:25,989
I figure it's a positive thing
for the world.

1009
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:28,700
You're not known for being a hard-liner.

1010
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:32,496
Well, I have my own standards.
I just try to keep them private.

1011
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,919
As far as I'm concerned,
I don't care who killed him...

1012
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,880
...and I don't care
who gets rich because of it.

1013
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:48,262
But Oscar is not like that.

1014
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:52,849
You know, his whole life is based on
doing the right thing.

1015
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:54,768
He's the only person I know like that.

1016
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,480
Sometimes, it's a real pain in the ass.
Even for him.

1017
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:04,820
Oscar's unhappy right now.
I mean, he is in pain.

1018
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:08,198
- Why is that?
- Because he likes you.

1019
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:09,866
Even better than I do...

1020
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:13,870
...that's why he's busting his butt
trying to find this Mary Ann Simpson.

1021
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:18,166
They found her place
in Miami yesterday.

1022
01:28:18,334 --> 01:28:19,543
Yeah?

1023
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:23,880
But the woman herself was gone.
Seems like she left in a hurry.

1024
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:28,051
Oscar thought any story
she could tell might help.

1025
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:30,470
He thinks you need help.

1026
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,682
Oh, come on.

1027
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,896
Someone is putting you
into deep trouble, my friend.

1028
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:44,151
From 3:30 to 5 a.m.
the night Walker was killed...

1029
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,237
...someone called
your hotel room repeatedly.

1030
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:49,906
The hotel didn't wanna
put them through...

1031
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:53,160
...but whoever it was
convinced them that it was an emergency.

1032
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:56,872
Your phone rang and rang,
but you didn't answer.

1033
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,082
- That's easy.
- Don't.

1034
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,375
Don't say anything.

1035
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:03,086
Just save it for some other time.

1036
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,173
It gets worse.

1037
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:14,097
Now someone's trying
to give us Edmund's glasses.

1038
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:21,813
We don't know who and we don't know
what the glasses will tell us...

1039
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:25,817
...but our negotiations are continuing.

1040
01:29:35,244 --> 01:29:38,663
I wish I knew what to tell you, Ned,
but I don't have any good ideas.

1041
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,092
I'll see you.

1042
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:28,797
We know each other, don't we?

1043
01:30:29,006 --> 01:30:31,842
Michael Glenn, with Bashford-Hillerman.

1044
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,511
Ned Racine.

1045
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:38,140
Oh, Christ, I've done it again.

1046
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:41,268
I'm just here waiting for some people.

1047
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:45,814
Okay, this is silly.

1048
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:48,942
You're not still mad
about that Gourson business?

1049
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:51,027
We had to do it.

1050
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:54,698
Costanza practically insisted
that we sue you.

1051
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,868
Nobody at our place likes malpractice
against other lawyers.

1052
01:30:58,035 --> 01:30:59,578
Forget it.

1053
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:04,666
Well, hey, I tried to make it up to you.

1054
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,879
You ever meet a lady
named Matty Walker?

1055
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,214
You'd remember her.

1056
01:31:11,382 --> 01:31:13,467
- A very hot number.
- Matty Walker.

1057
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,135
Yeah, I met her at a party.

1058
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,721
She said she was going up there...

1059
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:20,474
...and wanted to know about lawyers.

1060
01:31:21,517 --> 01:31:23,894
- So I gave her your name. Oh, boy.
- When was this?

1061
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:27,689
I don't know. A long time.
Maybe last year sometime.

1062
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,484
- I gotta get going.
- You tell her about the Gourson case?

1063
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:34,654
Hey, pal, I was trying to get you work.

1064
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:36,573
Jesus. Are you nuts?

1065
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,909
Did you tell her about Gourson?

1066
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:42,454
Maybe I told her how we met.
Yeah, maybe.

1067
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:13,151
BEVERLY:
Is something wrong with your phone?

1068
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:16,446
It's just off the hook. Why?

1069
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:20,158
Teddy Lewis is in County.
He's very anxious to talk to you.

1070
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:27,666
I don't know. It's a thing in Lauderdale,
but they're not telling me.

1071
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:31,461
- I'm a little worried.
- I'll find out.

1072
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:34,339
No, that's not why I called you.

1073
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:36,466
In fact, I got me another lawyer.

1074
01:32:40,763 --> 01:32:42,681
I think it would be better.

1075
01:32:43,307 --> 01:32:48,728
- You know Schlisgal?
- Yeah, he's good.

1076
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:57,153
This broad came to me last week.
A real looker.

1077
01:32:57,321 --> 01:33:00,156
She said that you told her
how she could reach me...

1078
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:03,827
...and I figured that you must have
because she knew all about it.

1079
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,329
She said that you wanted another one.

1080
01:33:09,792 --> 01:33:14,170
She had me show her how to
rig it to a door with a little delay.

1081
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:16,840
Does any of this mean anything to you?

1082
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,470
Then I'm glad I told you.
You better watch your step.

1083
01:33:24,348 --> 01:33:26,266
Thanks, Teddy.

1084
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:31,271
Racine, man, don't thank me yet...

1085
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:35,483
...because these guys have been
asking me about The Breakers.

1086
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:42,866
Hey, I ain't told them shit,
but I don't like the look on their faces.

1087
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:47,370
[LINE RINGING]

1088
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,665
[PHONE RINGS]

1089
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,085
Mr. Racine's office.

1090
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:40,090
Ned, Mrs. Walker. Do you want her?

1091
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:43,468
Yeah.

1092
01:34:58,609 --> 01:35:02,445
- Hello.
MATTY: Hello, Ned. Can we talk?

1093
01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:05,573
Okay.

1094
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:08,743
- Where are you?
- I'm in Miami.

1095
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:12,414
I've been running around like crazy
and I couldn't reach you before I left.

1096
01:35:12,581 --> 01:35:15,458
Ned, everything is gonna be all right.

1097
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:18,128
- Tell me.
- I've got the money.

1098
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:22,674
I've taken it and sent it somewhere safe.
It's all ours now.

1099
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:26,136
- But that's not the best part.
- What's the best part?

1100
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:28,680
The glasses. I got them back.

1101
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:31,307
That is, they should be ours by now.
Betty had them.

1102
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:34,310
She wanted money.
That's why I had to come down here.

1103
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:37,731
She made it all very difficult,
but I think it worked out.

1104
01:35:38,023 --> 01:35:41,151
- Do you have them?
- No. She wouldn't do that.

1105
01:35:41,318 --> 01:35:43,027
She's putting them in the boathouse.

1106
01:35:43,195 --> 01:35:45,530
In the top drawer
of the dresser in the boathouse.

1107
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:48,658
They should be there now
if she's kept up her end.

1108
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:50,952
Yeah.

1109
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,873
I think you'd better get them right away.
I don't trust her.

1110
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,710
- In the boathouse?
- That's right.

1111
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:01,087
The top drawer of the dresser.

1112
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:03,840
Oh, Ned, we're gonna be all right.

1113
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:08,511
I'll leave here as soon as I can.
I should be there by 7:30.

1114
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:12,474
I can't wait to see you, darling.
We've made it.

1115
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:18,021
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1116
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:20,982
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1117
01:38:03,627 --> 01:38:05,169
I better go get him.

1118
01:40:36,613 --> 01:40:40,074
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Matty.

1119
01:40:41,785 --> 01:40:45,288
- Where's your car?
- It's out back with yours.

1120
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:49,042
- Why didn't you turn the lights on?
- I could see.

1121
01:40:52,296 --> 01:40:54,255
It's all ours now.

1122
01:40:56,508 --> 01:40:58,843
We could leave tonight if we wanted to.

1123
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,473
- It's all over.
- Yes, it is.

1124
01:41:05,184 --> 01:41:06,976
Ned, what is that?

1125
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:09,520
It's Edmund's gun.
You remember it, don't you?

1126
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:11,189
What's happened?

1127
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:14,609
- I think you know.
- No, I swear I don't.

1128
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:16,402
It's the glasses, Matty.

1129
01:41:16,987 --> 01:41:20,615
Weren't they there?
Didn't she bring them?

1130
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,076
I didn't see them.

1131
01:41:23,994 --> 01:41:26,204
She promised me she would bring them.

1132
01:41:26,371 --> 01:41:30,666
Maybe I missed them.
The way you missed them that night.

1133
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:34,045
Ned, I don't know what you're thinking,
but you're wrong.

1134
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:35,922
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

1135
01:41:36,381 --> 01:41:40,343
- I love you, you've got to believe that.
- Keep talking, Matty.

1136
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:43,930
Experience shows
I can be convinced of anything.

1137
01:41:50,312 --> 01:41:53,648
I did arrange to meet you, Ned,
but that all changed.

1138
01:41:53,816 --> 01:41:58,569
You changed it. I fell in love with you.
I didn't plan that.

1139
01:41:58,737 --> 01:42:01,739
You never quit, do you?
You just keep on coming.

1140
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:04,700
How can I prove it to you?
What can I say?

1141
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:08,454
The glasses, Matty.
Why don't you go down there...

1142
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:10,706
...and get them?

1143
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:13,334
You said they weren't there.

1144
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:16,462
I said I didn't see them.

1145
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:35,273
I'll go, Ned.

1146
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:38,693
I'll go and look for them.

1147
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:56,669
Ned, no matter what you think...

1148
01:42:57,629 --> 01:42:59,672
...I do love you.

1149
01:43:19,776 --> 01:43:20,943
No.

1150
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:24,864
Matty!

1151
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:09,867
She's alive.

1152
01:44:14,122 --> 01:44:16,666
They found the body in the boathouse.

1153
01:44:17,376 --> 01:44:20,002
What if that was
somebody else's body in the boathouse?

1154
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:24,048
What if it was already there
when I got there, dead and waiting for me?

1155
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:27,051
Maybe her friend, Mary Ann.

1156
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:30,471
Her teeth were left, man.

1157
01:44:31,098 --> 01:44:35,059
They were sent back to Illinois.
The identification was positive.

1158
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:37,353
That was her.

1159
01:44:37,771 --> 01:44:40,898
That was Matty Tyler Walker.

1160
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:44,193
That was her and she is dead.

1161
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:47,446
You are not listening to me.

1162
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:52,118
Maybe she was using
this other girl's name...

1163
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:55,079
...since she first met Walker
three years ago...

1164
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:59,250
...since she first spotted him and decided
to take him one way or the other.

1165
01:44:59,668 --> 01:45:01,294
Maybe...

1166
01:45:01,878 --> 01:45:06,132
...Walker, or any of us,
never knew her real name.

1167
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,551
Why would she want to hide
her identity?

1168
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:10,553
I don't know.

1169
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:14,015
Maybe because there was something
in her past, something so bad...

1170
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:16,767
...that it would queer it with Walker
if he found out...

1171
01:45:16,935 --> 01:45:19,061
...that he'd never marry her.

1172
01:45:24,526 --> 01:45:25,901
Let's say...

1173
01:45:26,069 --> 01:45:31,073
...that she's living as this other girl,
this person from her past.

1174
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,910
So there's only one person
in the whole world...

1175
01:45:35,078 --> 01:45:37,872
...who knows who she really is.

1176
01:45:38,206 --> 01:45:41,250
And then, just when she's got me
on the line...

1177
01:45:42,127 --> 01:45:46,255
...she's finally going to collect,
that person shows up.

1178
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:50,092
That girl finds her
and threatens to expose her...

1179
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:52,970
...so Matty starts paying her off.

1180
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:56,265
Maybe she even promised to cut her in
on Edmund's money.

1181
01:45:58,101 --> 01:46:01,604
Now she's got to share it
with two people.

1182
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,733
But then, Matty sees a way...

1183
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:09,278
...to get rid of both of us at once.

1184
01:46:12,115 --> 01:46:14,075
At the boathouse.

1185
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:18,996
A way to solve all her problems...

1186
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:22,958
...and get clear
with no one looking for her.

1187
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:29,298
She was right too, because I would have
never stopped looking for her.

1188
01:46:32,302 --> 01:46:34,428
Matty killed this other girl...

1189
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:38,057
...and put her body in the boathouse.

1190
01:46:38,433 --> 01:46:40,142
It was so...

1191
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:43,270
...perfect. It was so...

1192
01:46:44,356 --> 01:46:46,482
...clean.

1193
01:46:47,692 --> 01:46:51,654
You find two bodies,
me and this girl...

1194
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:54,657
...two killers, dead.

1195
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:56,659
Case closed.

1196
01:46:58,036 --> 01:47:01,747
You can't find the money, can you, Oscar?
Doesn't that tell you something?

1197
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:06,168
It tells me she moved it and we can't
find it, and that don't mean shit.

1198
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:10,423
It could be sitting in a bank

to come for it.

Do you hear what you're saying?
It's crazy.

1201
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:22,852
Matty would have to be one quick,
smart broad.

1202
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:30,484
Oscar, don't you understand?
That was her special gift.

1203
01:47:30,694 --> 01:47:33,237
She was relentless.

1204
01:47:39,744 --> 01:47:43,456
Matty was the kind of person
who could do what was necessary.

1205
01:47:50,213 --> 01:47:52,673
Whatever was necessary.
