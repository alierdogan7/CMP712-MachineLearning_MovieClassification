1
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,400
[Olaf Andersen] Uh, ladies and
gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, please.

2
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,320
Your attention.

3
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,560
I think you all know our guests
of honor today.

4
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,720
Our great congressman,
Jeff Johnson,

5
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,440
and Vera Johnson,
his lovely and gracious wife.

6
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,400
Many of you know that Jeff
is now completely recovered
from a triple bypass operation.

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,600
Doesn't he look great?

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,280
I never felt better.

9
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,760
Before I turn the floor
over to the congressman,
I'd like to thank my old friends,

10
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Mr. And Mrs. Zeke Bridges, for the use
of their wonderful, lovely home.

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,720
[Andersen]
Thank you, Zeke.

12
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,920
Now, sirs,
ladies and gentlemen,

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
- In the 20 years of the great...
- Som-bitch!

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,800
Uh... well, seems like
a host's work is never done.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
- [Laughing]
- Now, in the 20 years...

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,480
that the Honorable
Jefferson Davis Johnson has been
our representative in Congress...

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,200
Excuse me. Pardon me.
What do you say, Pete?

18
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,160
- [Andersen]
Whatever our walk of life:
- Excuse me.

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,920
- Utilities, pharmaceuticals...
- Pardon me. Hi, Malcolm.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,960
One bourbon sour straight up
with extra orange,

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,840
and one gibson, no onion,

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,000
and two white wine spritzers
and a Lowenbrau.

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,920
[Jamaican Accent]
Allow me to light your cigarette
for you. Hold this for me, sir.

24
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,000
The way your hair matches your eyes,
I don't know how I can control myself.

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,880
Excuse me,
I'll get those drinks.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,920
I can't believe that you're Inga.
You don't look Swedish.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,040
You're so different
from your picture.

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
[Swedish Accent]
That wasn't me on the TV,

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,760
but that sure was me
on the telephone.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,960
[Normal Voice]
You want me to prove it, Zeke?

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,880
You told me that you want me
to tie you up and beat you with...

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,560
My God, Inga,
that was on the phone.

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,160
I never thought you'd be in my house.
You've got to get outta here.

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,000
[Swedish Accent]
But you told me you wanted me!
You told me to quit my job.

35
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,560
[Normal Voice]
And now, honey, here I am.

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,000
- Not now, waiter. Please!
- Don't worry about a thing.
I'll handle this. You!

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,720
Bag on the floor,
hands in the air. Do it!

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,640
Sergeant Brown, vice squad,
undercover operations.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,920
- I know who you are, dirty pig!
- Shut up! You're under arrest.

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,960
- My God, what's goin' on here?
- Sir, you've been the target of
a ruthless gang of con artists.

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,840
It all started when you called
the "Girls of Many Nations" party line.

42
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,760
It's 1-900-phone-sex?

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,280
You put it on your credit card
instead of your phone bill...

44
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,840
'cause you didn't want your wife
to see it, right? Big mistake.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,200
The gang used your
credit card number to find out
everything they could about you.

46
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,240
It's the gang's M.O. to wait until
the victim's having a big party...

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,880
and will do anything, pay big money,
to avoid embarrassment.

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,520
Embarrassment?
Som-bitch!

49
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,160
This goes
beyond embarrassment!

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,760
A hundred of my very best friends
paid a thousand dollars apiece...

51
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,640
to have a drink
with Congressman Johnson.

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,680
Not to mention the fact my wife
is probably looking for me right now.

53
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,080
That is exactly what
their evil scheme is depending on.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,480
In fact, any second now,
a huge Latino man's...

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,840
- Gonna burst in pretending
he's an outraged husband.
- Inga!

56
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,600
- What're you doin' with my wife?
- Senor...

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,480
- [Bridges] It's okay, Alice.
- My friend, rum and coke.

58
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,440
Don't let anyone else in, please.
Thanks.

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
- [Armando] Did he touch you?
- I got your rum and coke.

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,160
There's your rum and coke,
and she can drink it with you!

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,520
- [Speaking Spanish, Indistinct]
- Hey, i callate la boca.

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,320
I callate la boca ahora!
I ahora asi!

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,680
Now you see how they were gonna plan
to con you outta your money.

64
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,320
But I know better, 'cause I know
you're a courageous citizen.

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,680
- And I know you're gonna testify.
Yes, you're gonna testify.
- Oh!

66
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,480
- I can't testify.
- Sure you can. All you've
done was phone sex.

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
- A lot of people have done that.
- He wanted me to tie him up...

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,520
and spank him with
a wet garter belt.

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
- [Chuckling] No, no, not me. No, no.
- [Thomas] Excuse me.

70
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,040
That is between the fantasy hostess and
the freak. I don't even wanna hear it.

71
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,680
- "Freak"?
- Hey, poppy.

72
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,160
I got a tape in the car. Eight-track
or cassette. You wanna hear it?

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,640
- No, no! No, no! Thank you very much.
- Sir, please.

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,640
They're trying to intimidate you
by telling you that they have an
audio tape of you freaking on...

75
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
Did you think you were gonna intimidate
him? You're not intimidating him.

76
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,480
He's going to testify, because
his family may not know he's a freak,

77
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,920
but he's been married 20, 30 years.
His wife knows he's a freak.

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,200
"Freak"? Uh, Sergeant Brown, I have
to talk to you in private, please.

79
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
Mr. Bridges, I can't leave
the suspects by themselves.

80
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,240
Well, let's, uh, lock 'em
in the crapper.

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,720
Okay, come on.
Move in the bathroom.

82
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
- Come on, man, move it. Come on!
- [Speaking Spanish, Indistinct]

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,520
Hey, hey! Vamonos,
muchachos, goddamn it!

84
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,960
Now you've all met my
legislative assistant, Kimberly.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Kimberly and my fine staff,
along with myself,

86
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,840
will be available to you
24 hours a day.

87
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm proud to be
your man in Washington.

88
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,960
I plan to keep goin' back
as long as you keep sendin' me.

89
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,680
[Cheering]

90
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,600
Please listen, Sergeant.

91
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
- I'm the chairman of a large,
conservative insurance company.
- I know that.

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,480
I know your chief, Sergeant Brown.
Help me and you'll be Lieutenant Brown.

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,840
Just get these people
the hell outta here quietly.

94
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,480
Mr. Bridges, I know
these people. Okay?

95
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,800
If you let them go,
they're just gonna blackmail you.

96
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,800
I don't care.
What do they want?

97
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,640
- Goin' by their other victims,
it costs like $5,000.
- Okay.

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,400
That's 5,000 each, you know.

99
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
Okay.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,720
You know there's
four people in the gang.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,440
- Twenty thousand dollars?
- See, that's what I'm tellin' you.

102
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,800
- I think you should testify.
- No, I can't.

103
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,880
- Please put your money away, sir.
- Look, it's...

104
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,520
It's just that I don't have that
much cash. I've only got $12,000.

105
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,240
- And there's four people in the gang.
- Wait a minute.

106
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,760
- My rolex.
- Oh, Mr. Bridges, no.
No, no, no. Please, sir.

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,680
No, it's worth $10,000.

108
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,960
Oh, Mr. Bridges, I don't wanna take your
watch, I don't wanna take your money.

109
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,320
- Besides, they don't want a watch.
They want cash.
- Take the damn money!

110
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,440
Take the watch, please!
Get them outta here and get that tape.

111
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,560
You know this goes against
my every principle.

112
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,520
Darlin',
don't you look wonderful.

113
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Glad to see ya. Nice to...
Hey, how's that knee, huh?

114
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,160
- [Speaking Spanish, Indistinct]
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[Spanish, Indistinct]

115
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,040
Inga will miss you!
Bye-bye.

116
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,160
What are you doin'?
I gotta go get the tape.

117
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,400
I don't want you to give them the money
until I get the tape in my hand.

118
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,160
Come with me.

119
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Chief!

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,960
By golly,
am I glad to see you.

121
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had an emergency.

122
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,280
You know Sergeant...

123
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,960
[Bridges]
Where'd he go?

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,680
Sergeant Brown, the vice squad.

125
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,720
We don't have a vice squad.

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,040
You don't have a...
Som-bitch!

127
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,280
Oh, waiter,
where's my bourbon sour?

128
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,520
Oh, you must think I'm Kareem.
I'm Jamal.

129
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,640
He stiff you on your
drinks too? He fired.

130
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,440
Kareem! Wait right there.
Kareem, where's this woman's drink?
This woman's thirsty!

131
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,200
- [Man] I've always enjoyed
the time we've spent together.
- [Woman] Oh, thank you.

132
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,920
[Man] Why don't we
sit down over here?

133
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,560
[Guests Laughing]

134
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,200
Olaf, I'm thinking
of retiring from Congress.

135
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,440
You can't retire. You just promised
all these people you're gonna run again.

136
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,760
That was a political promise.
You know better than to believe that.

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,280
[Andersen]
Zeke, come here. Listen to this.

138
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,240
Have you all seen a waiter
come through here?

139
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,440
No, I haven't, but, Zeke,
I need your help. Hey!

140
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,360
- What's got into Zeke?
- Damned if I know.

141
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,800
Listen, Jeff, you know you got
the best job in the world, don't you?

142
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,040
You get to go hunting, fishing,
skiing and golfing.

143
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,800
The best resorts. Then you get
to call it, "official business," huh?

144
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,400
And, Jeff, you know there's
no aphrodisiac like power.

145
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,840
Are you tired of having
the most beautiful and intelligent
women in this country?

146
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,360
Ah, the joy's gone out
of Congress, Olaf.

147
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,320
No, that perks thing
was the last straw.

148
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,800
And who needs the aggravation?
Life's too short.

149
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,800
Yeah, well, look, Jeff.
You can't retire.

150
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,360
If I retire this year,
I get to keep $1.3 million...

151
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,480
that's left in my campaign fund.

152
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,400
It's called
"the grandfather loophole."

153
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,920
All right, Jeff.
I got it. Come here.

154
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,760
There's this small software company
that's about to go through the roof.

155
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,200
Now, what you do, you buy a few thousand
dollars worth of stock options.

156
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,680
It's gonna bring in a half a million
dollars easy. That's just for openers.

157
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,040
Huh?

158
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,280
If you put it like that,
I suppose I...

159
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,520
have a duty to continue
my career in public service.

160
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,880
"Duty"! [Chuckles]
You're something else, Jeff.

161
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,960
I am definitely
in the wrong business.

162
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,480
- Som-bitch!
- Well?

163
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,120
- Som-bitch!
- Yes!

164
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
- [Laughing Together]
- [Swedish Accent] I love it!

165
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,320
[Grunting, Groaning]

166
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,960
- [Woman Sighing]
- [Johnson] Ohh! Oh, Kimberly!

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,920
[Kimberly]
Oh, Congressman!

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,760
[Johnson] Oh, Kimberly,
you're so good! Yeah!

169
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh! Oh God! Oh, Oh!
Oh, I got a cramp!

170
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,560
I got a cramp. It's okay,
don't stop. Don't stop!

171
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Oh! Yeah, yeah!
Oh, God, yes, yes!

172
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
- Kimberly! Yeah!
- Oh, Congressman!

173
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,640
- Oh, now, now! Yeah! Oh! Oh, my God!
- Oh, Congressman!

174
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,480
Oh, my God!
Oh, my... [Gagging]

175
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,880
[Kimberly Panting]

176
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,200
[Panting]

177
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
Oh, my God!

178
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,760
## [Funeral Organ]

179
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,280
[Dick Dodge]
It was my honor...

180
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,840
to serve with Jeff Johnson
in Congress for a generation.

181
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,480
No one was a better legislator,
a better husband.

182
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,200
We're gonna miss him. But we are
grateful that his passing was peaceful.

183
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,480
The consummate public servant,

184
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,400
working late into the night
at his desk.

185
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,920
- Thank you.
- [Dodge] Vera?

186
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,640
- Let me talk to you
for a minute in here.
- Excuse me.

187
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,880
Uh, now...

188
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,360
I know that, uh, you're still
in shock over Jeff's passing,

189
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,480
- But we need to talk about his seat.
- We do?

190
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,840
I would like for you to announce
that you're gonna run for Congress.

191
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,760
With your name, you can't lose.

192
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,360
Mrs. Jeff Johnson
would win in a walk.

193
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,320
Dick, I've been
a Washington wife for 20 years.

194
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,640
I think that's enough bullshit
for one lifetime.

195
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,880
I'd help. I'd be running
the office night and day.

196
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,320
I'm sure you would, dear.
But I couldn't give you...

197
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,040
the same kind of job satisfaction
Jeff gave you.

198
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,240
Uh-huh.

199
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,480
How did I end up with a thief
for a grandson?

200
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,440
Hey! Aha!
Hey, thieves steal.

201
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,760
I con, all right?
It's different. I'm an artist.

202
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,880
I'm a con artist.

203
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,160
- Hey, look! There's the new ad.
- Hey.

204
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
[Loretta As Inga] I am Inga.
I am here from Sweden.

205
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,920
And I'm so lonely.

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,280
I need a man,
and so do my girlfriends.

207
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,040
Maria, my hot-blooded
Spanish friend.

208
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,680
- Babette, zee Parisian pussycat...
- [Meows]

209
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,760
- And many others.
- I hope you sprain your lips
from doin' this.

210
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,160
- I hope your lip muscles freeze up.
- We take all major credit cards.

211
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,120
[Loretta As Inga] So call
the Girls of Many Nations at...

212
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,000
[Swedish Accent] What do you think
of my accent, Grandma?

213
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,040
- Very, very good. Hey, hey.
- [Telephone Ringing]

214
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,560
Thank you for calling "Girls
of Many Nations" party line.

215
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,240
For hot-blooded
Italian wildcats, press one now.

216
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,320
For perky American cheerleaders,
press two now.

217
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,240
For a busty Swedish love goddess,
press three now.

218
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,120
- [Single Tone]
- Another customer for Inga.

219
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,120
Don't you dare
talk to that man!

220
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,000
[Swedish Accent]
Hello, this is Inga.

221
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, hello, Paul.
How are you?

222
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,040
Oh! [Giggles] Tell me,
Paul, do you have Mastercard?

223
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,960
If you don't hang up that phone,
I will flush it down the toilet!

224
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,240
Uh, no, Paul.
Call me later, please.

225
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,200
What's the matter with you?
This is my business.

226
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,720
You are not only a con man,
you get your cousin Loretta...

227
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,040
- To help you by talkin' dirty?
Shame on you!
- Granny!

228
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,480
You mad 'cause you can't show my picture
around the pool no more, Grandma?

229
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Of course not.

230
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,400
Look what these arthritic hands
have been doin'.

231
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,520
- Oh...
- Don't "oh." What are you "oh-ing"?

232
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,840
Thomas Jefferson Johnson.
Why you keep usin' my middle name?

233
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,280
It sound like a tap dancer
or somethin'.

234
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,120
Make me proud of you, Thomas.
Make me proud of the name you carry.

235
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm Ned Grable, Vice President
and General Manager of WFL.

236
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,520
We think Mrs. Jeff Johnson
did the right thing...

237
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,880
in not running for the congressional
seat left vacant by her husband's death.

238
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,640
Jeff Johnson's name
may still be magic,

239
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,960
but it'll take more than
the magic of name recognition...

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,160
to solve our region's problems.

241
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,120
I'm Ned Grable.

242
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,120
Name recognition.

243
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,160
Lordy, what a notion.

244
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
People would have to be
some kind of boobs...

245
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,320
just to vote for somebody
because their name was Johnson.

246
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,520
I remember once back in Georgia.
They even elected a dead man.

247
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,440
His name was still
on the ballot and...

248
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,240
folks were just
used to voting for him.

249
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,040
[Loretta]
Okay. Bye-bye.

250
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,600
My friends, I wanna
tell y'all about a town...

251
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,840
where the streets
are paved with gold.

252
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm talkin' about a town
where the marks will take you
to dinner after you fuck 'em.

253
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm talkin' about a place that,
when they run outta money,
they just print some more.

254
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,600
In this town, a cat bounced 900 checks,
didn't even have to go to jail.

255
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,040
- You mean "Las Begas."
- No, not "Las Begas."

256
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,880
No, honey, he's talkin'
about Washington, D.C.

257
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,360
l... You all ready for this?

258
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,760
I am running for Congress.

259
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,080
- What is this, a joke?
- What's the con, T?

260
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, I don't get it, man.

261
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,640
- Yo, man, Van Dyke.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
- You remember Willie Sutton?
- My hero.

263
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,400
What did Willie Sutton say when they
asked him how come he robbed banks?

264
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,320
- That's where the money is.
- Exactly.

265
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,080
Washington, D.C.
That's where the money is.

266
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,880
Listen, I have been doin' some research.
I've been to the library.

267
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,960
- [Laughing]
- Why you laughing? Congressmen,
when they get elected,

268
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,400
they get $130,000 a year.
That's their base salary.

269
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
But then they have these things
called "PACs." Okay, political
action committees, right?

270
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,720
Then there's these lobbyists.
The lobbyists' whole point in life
is to buy you off.

271
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,840
They buy you off
and it's totally legal.

272
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,280
It's the con of a lifetime,
and I know we can do this shit.

273
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,160
Who "we," white man?

274
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Us! We! Us! If I get elected,
I gotta have a staff.

275
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,920
I'm gonna get a staff allowance.
It says here that new Congress...

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,400
- You get a staff allowance of $537,000.
- [Armando] Ooh!

277
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
- Damn!
- Senor!

278
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,960
I get that kinda cash, I'm splitting it
up with my homies and my homette.

279
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,480
How exactly are you gonna
get your butt to Congress?

280
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,040
Yeah, T. Why the hell
would anybody vote for you?

281
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,400
It's not like they're voting for me.
They're voting for name recognition.

282
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
The congressman here
was Jeff Johnson.

283
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,440
My middle name is Jefferson,
last name is Johnson.

284
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,640
Cut off the Thomas,
shorten the Jefferson,

285
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,440
Jeff John... nobody knows that
their congressman is dead.

286
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,240
Who knows that Jeff is dead?
He's a congressman. Who cares?

287
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,360
If I get on the ballot as Jeff Johnson,
nobody's gonna know.

288
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,440
Well, how you gonna
get on the ballot?

289
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,120
That's where you all
come into play.

290
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,680
My friends, I need, uh,
[Chuckling]...

291
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,160
I need, uh,
5,625 signatures.

292
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,120
- [Laughing]
- I knew this "we" shit had a catch.

293
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,760
Hey, man, you all
got a better plan?

294
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,720
I do.

295
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,560
Who are these "Silver Foxes"?
Old people who just like to vote?

296
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,120
It's a political party.
The big thing is, they got
their own line on the ballot.

297
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,080
They already got the signatures.

298
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
- May I help you?
- Uh, good afternoon.

299
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,960
- We have an appointment
to see Hattie Rifkin.
- Right.

300
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,240
You wanna talk politics?
Talk.

301
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,800
Uh, we was wonderin', who you gonna
run for Congress this year?

302
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,320
Ah, the usual sacrificial lamb.

303
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,920
Probably Sylvia Roland.
She just lost her husband.

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,240
She needs to meet new people.
Why?

305
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,040
Miss Rifkin. I'd like to run
on the Silver Foxes' ticket.

306
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,800
I believe and care
about you and your issues.

307
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,400
That's what my son says,
but does he call?

308
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,280
What makes you think
a group of alter kakers...

309
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,000
is gonna support a man who hasn't
clipped his first nose hair yet?

310
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,400
Because I can win.

311
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,840
No, no. A Republican can win.
A Democrat can win.

312
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,920
A Silver Fox can only make
a symbolic point.

313
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,320
Mrs. Rifkin, if you get me on
the Silver Foxes' ballot line,

314
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,600
- And if you give me the support...
- Lf, if.

But got haste oykh

317
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,160
- [Chuckling]
- Uh, what's all this?

318
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,760
Oh, she just said that if my grandmother
had balls, she'd be my grandfather.

319
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,440
And I told her that God
never told nobody to be stupid.

320
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,800
Where the hell did you learn
to speak Yiddish?

321
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,320
[Yiddish Accent]
I learned it from Morris Elfbein,
da gin king of Miami Beach.

322
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,360
He taught me that
and he also taught me...

323
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,720
you don't always have to have
the best cards to win the hand.

324
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,880
Maybe not in gin, but in politics,
young man, you need money to win.

325
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,120
You need a name to win.
You need...

326
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,640
- I do have a name.
- What, you're an athlete?

327
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,160
- You're not on MTV, are you?
- My name is Johnson.

328
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,960
Jeff Johnson.
The name you know.

329
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,920
Jeff Johnson?

330
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,760
Well, that's a name even our
Alzheimer's group will remember.

331
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,320
I'm not quite sure I understand,
Professor Franklin.

332
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,720
You did your doctoral thesis
on my husband?

333
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,240
Yes, Mrs. Johnson.
Your husband was a very great man.

334
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,360
He did so much to help my people.

335
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,720
I remember the time he said
that welfare is a drug...

336
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,080
and you have to kick it
like cold turkey.

337
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,560
And at the time, I was on welfare
and I did just that.

338
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,240
It inspired me to get on with
my life. Very inspirational.

339
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,400
Yes, well, really,
I'm sure if he were alive...

340
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,920
I was actually in the audience one day
when he looked out and he said,

341
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,120
"If you people'd just get off
your dead asses and go look for work,

342
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,440
maybe America can be a decent place
to live in again."

343
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,600
That inspired me.
My God, it made me move my ass.

344
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,600
And I have a poster
of that on my wall,

345
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,920
and I show it to all my relatives
and friends and Negroes.

346
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,680
Really, well. It's kind of you to come
all the way from... Where was it?

347
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,440
The Wilson Pickett State, uh,
Teachers' College, ma'am.

348
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,800
But I didn't just come here to pay
my respects to your husband.

349
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,760
I came here because, because
your husband deserves an archive...

350
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,240
where students
can study his legacy.

351
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,720
- So you want his papers.
- Not just his papers, ma'am.

352
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,600
I would like all buttons
and posters and bumper stickers...

353
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,320
and all the campaign paraphernalia
you can spare, ma'am.

354
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,240
I know you may have
a sentimental attachment to
a lot of these things and you...

355
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,320
- Take 'em.
- Pardon me?

356
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,040
Take 'em all. Do you want
the wedding photos too?

357
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,960
- Oh, I don't know
if I think that's necessary.
- That's lucky.

358
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,360
So you won't have to go
rooting around in the garbage.

359
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,760
- Oh. Hmm.
- Hmm.

360
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,680
You're in pretty good shape
for a professor.

361
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,960
Do you work out?

362
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,520
Uh, why, yes. Do you?

363
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,280
Why, yes.

364
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,280
Hmm.

Are you sure you don't wanna come
to Washington with us, Homer?

366

373
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,840
No, you can't. He's just had surgery
for a deviated septum.

374
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,840
Yeah, thank you.

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,640
we ran a positive campaign.

The people have spoken!

421

Ask not what your country
can do for you.

422
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,920
You have nothing to fear
but fear itself.

423
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,120
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

Congressman, I hope you don't think
I'm outta line for meeting you here.

439
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,920
I just thought you might need help with
logistics, settling in at your hotel.

440
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,280
Since you didn't make it to the Harvard
seminar for freshmen congressmen,

441
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,120
I took the liberty of putting together
a set of their papers for you.

442
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,960
Thank you for your initiative,
but I gotta admit to you, I've
never been much of a student.

443
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,760
But you can brief
my staff on that, you know.

444
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,800
Uh, staff, what hotel
are we staying at?

445
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,240
- You book the hotel?
- No. Talk to him.

- You book the hotel?
- What hotel?

447
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
Nobody told me
about no damn hotel.

Uh, is, uh, staff...

449
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,200

some vital details, so...

Oh, geez,

Hey, I kick your ass.

Careful with that bag.

462
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,480
Don't throw it in there like that.
I paid too much for that bag.

- Say, Congressman?
- Yo.

464
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,920
I'd like to ask you something.

I would appreciate it if you
would consider me to be your A.A.

Oh, that's very nice of you.
That's a very decent gesture.

- As you know, I used to work
for Congressman Johnson.

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,560
And I would like to work for you,
Congressman Johnson.

473
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,880
So it would be sorta like an affirmative
action sorta thing. [Chuckles]

474
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,480
Only kidding. I got your resume.
I'll call you, okay?

- Oh, we're going up to
Congressman Johnson's office.

483
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,560
I hate to be the one to tell you,
but Congressman Johnson died.

484
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,120
I'm the new congressman. I'm Congressman
Johnson and this is my staff.

485
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,880
I'm sorry, Congressman.
I didn't see your pin.

486
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,480
In fact, I still
don't see your pin.

487
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,360
- What pin?
- Your member-of-Congress pin.

488
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,000
- I'm gonna have to look you up.
- I'm in the book under Johnson.

491
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,400
- Yeah, I'm the man.
- No picture available.

492
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,200
Oh, wait a second. I have my driver's
license with me. Got a picture in late.

493
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,520
Here it...
If I can get it out.

494
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,760
- Driver's license.
- Oh.

495
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,280
See? Same cat.

496
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,840
How could I ever have doubted you?
Where to?

497
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,720
We're going up to 518.

498
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,920
Well, the elevator
only goes to four. You'll have
to take the stairs from there.

499
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,800
Are you gonna be grabbin' my ass
like old Congressman Johnson?

500
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,280
Oh, no. I would
never grab your ass.

501
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,640
Well, you said that awful fast.
What's wrong with my ass?

502
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,640
Oh, there's nothing
wrong with your ass.

503

I'm, I'm the new congressman,

and I won't be doin' none
of those things he did.

505
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,680
I ain't gonna grab nobody's old ass.
I mean, I ain't gonna grab nobody's ass.

506
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,360
You know? Hey, I think we
on the fourth floor.

507
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,000

00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,640
Later, baby.

511
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,920
Wait here a second.

512
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,640
Good morning, Congressman.

513
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,120
What is this shit-hole?
Look at this place. What is this?

514
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,800
Oh, um... you missed
the freshman lottery for offices.

515
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
They assign them by draw.

516
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,040
You didn't show for the draw,
so you got the worst office in Congress.

517
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,800
What lottery?
I missed a lottery?

518
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,080
It was all in those briefing books
I mailed you.

519
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,240
What else have we missed here?

520
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,960
Are you hiring me, Congressman?

521
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,520
- It's a shakedown.
- Excuse me?

522
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,400
Oh, ho-ho-ho! You're shaking
me down, aren't you?

Okay, I'm gonna love this town.

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,720
Okay, I've been here five minutes
and you're already shaking me down.

00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,640
All right, you're hired.

out there on the campaign trail,

raising money, kissing ass,
making speeches, dragging
our butts from place to place.

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,520
Thanks a lot.
And don't call me Jeff.

got elected? Lawyers or something?

and traffic for KTOK in Tulsa.

- Yeah, but don't go...

to his reception before
you go to my reception.

have to have a reception.

to have something.

about no reception.

The way everybody call you a member.

I spent so many years telling the Rotary
Club what was wrong in Washington...

571
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,080
they finally told me to either
put up or shut up. Ha!

572
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,080
So I put up, and here I am.

573
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,360
What are you talkin' about?
What's wrong with Washington?
Washington's great!

574
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,520
Oh, come on. We got acid rain
killing fish and nobody's stopping it.

575
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,960
There's topsoil being washed away.
No erosion programs.

in the livestock that...
- We might have some luck.

I knew you were a real comer.

00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,000
Hell, I bet Olaf Andersen
voted for you.

588
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,880
I don't know.
Who's Olaf Andersen?

589
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,640
Won't tell him you asked.

know what I mean?

593
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,160
Say, could I host a "welcome
to Washington" fund-raiser for you,

594
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,200
down at my law firm
on K Street?

595
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,760
- Absolutely.
- At $500 a head,

596
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,160
you could pick up 20, 25 grand
to help you get started.

598
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
And how much of that
are you gonna get?

599
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,280
It doesn't come off the top.

600
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,800
Down the road,
I'll bill each of them 500 an hour
whenever I take you to lunch.

601
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,280
You know, Terry, you and I
are gonna be so close.

602
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,480
I wanna welcome
the new members to Washington.

603
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,920
We haven't had a freshman class
this big in a long time.

604
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,320
[Laughing]

605
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,120
Well, Congress needs your new blood, and
you in turn are gonna need new friends.

606
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,480
That's why, tonight, we unite
the two great pillars of our system.

607
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Political and financial.

608
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,920
Now, you know, Congress
has taken many hits of late.

609
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,800
But, Congressmen,
look around you.

610
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,600
The people you see here tonight
are the ones that have stood behind us.

611
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,600
And they are the ones that will be
invaluable to you in your next campaign,

612
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,480
which I might remind you
is less than two years away.

613
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,160
Now this is our system of checks
and balances at its very finest.

614
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,120
Dick Dodge, from your home state.
Gonna run for speaker.

615
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,720
Raises more money
than any other member.

616
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,120
But, of course,
he's on the right committee,

617
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,120
- Which makes all the difference.
- Yeah, of course.

618
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,840
But I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know.

619
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,560
No, he's on the right committee, so
I guess that makes all the difference.

620
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,320
Not just on the committee.
He's chairman of it.

621
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,720
The big boys have to line up
to take numbers...

622
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,720
to throw money his way.

623
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,600
- Your friends can always call on you.
- No shit.

624
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,680
[Woman]
Thank you very much.

625
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,080
[Dodge]
Oh, uh, Mr. Johnson?

626
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,080
You know, it's customary
for the new members...

627
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,400
to pay a visit on us old fogies
in the leadership, especially
from your home state.

628
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,480
Well, I would have, but I
just got in town. I'm sorry, man.

629
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,040
You know, you can make up for it
by having a nightcap with me.

630
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,680
- Oh, absolutely.
- Can I have my car take you home?

631
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,440
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Chairman,

632
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,800
but you ain't about to start no homo
shit, are you? 'Cause I ain't with it.

633
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,080
- Oh?
- Hey.

634
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,400
No! But that's good thinking, Thomas.
I'm impressed by your instincts.

635
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,640
I didn't wanna
have to whup your ass.

636
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,800
- [Laughing]
- You know what I mean?

637
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,240
Tell me, Mr. Johnson,
why'd you come to Washington?

638
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,440
Well, of course, it's an opportunity
to do something for my country, and...

639
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,760
Now let's just cut the bullshit.

640
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,680
I saw how you got elected.

641
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,600
Now flukes like you are either
nut cases or troublemakers.

642
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,960
I just wanna know which one
I've got on my hands.

643
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,880
Why did you run for Congress?

644
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,200
- No bullshit?
- No bullshit.

645
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,320
We got this whole
topsoil problem...

646
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,360
and, uh, acid rain
is killing cattle.

647
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,480
- [Pounding At Door]
- What? Yes? What? What?

648
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,160
- What?
- [Thomas] Einhardt! Wake up!

649
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,880
[Pounding Continues]

650
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,840
What is the name of that committee
Dick Dodge is chairman of?

651
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,200
- Congressman, this is a surprise.
- Come on, man, spit it out.

652
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,800
- What's the name of the committee?
- Uh... Uh...

653
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Come on, come on, come on.
What is it?

654
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,640
Uh... oh.
Power and Industry.

655
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,560
- Is something wrong with the hotel?
- No.

656
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,720
Tell me about this Power and Industry.
I heard it's really good.

657
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,600
- This is a good thing, right?
- Yes, they call it "the honey pot."

658
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,280
Each member is constantly being lobbied
by every cash-rich trade group in town.

659
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,200
Oh, it's 2:40 a.m.
Did you realize that?

660
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,880
Ah, man, forget that!
We're public servants.

661
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,040
Time ain't supposed to mean
nothin' to us, right?

662
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,600
- How do I get on this committee?
- Um, that would be seniority.

663
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,600
Uh, after six terms in office,

664
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,800
uh, say, 12 years of service,

665
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,200
your name moves along the list
and before you know it,

666
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,440
you're off the Fisheries committee
and on to Power and Industry.

667
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
- Can this wait? I'm much
more coherent in the morning.
- No, you're doin' fine.

668
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,120
But I need to know how I can get
on this committee, like, immediately.

669
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,080
Okay, okay.
All right, all right.

670
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,040
Uh, immediately. Immediately.

671
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,320
- Within, say, your next four years?
- No, no, no, no.

672
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,680
Immediately,
like in my first four days.

673
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,880
Now you're a smart guy.
That's why I hired you.

674
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,880
You might be standin' here
in these fire engine boxer shorts,

675
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,720
but I have faith in you.
I'm countin' on you.

676
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,480
- Talk to me, Reinhardt.
- Yes, thank you.

677
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,440
I don't think
it's possible, sir.

678
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,400
It would be unprecedented
for a freshman congressman...

679
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,400
to be put onto that committee.

680
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,280
Unless...

681
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,560
Well, only in the most remote,

682
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,280
hypo...
hypothetical situation.

683
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,600
Yes?

684
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,640
- This is ridiculous, right?
- For instance?

685
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,440
Well, if the, uh, President
of the United States...

686
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,880
were to do you a personal favor.

687
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,320
Or, uh, some enormously powerful
special interest group.

688
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,560
Chairman Dodge, please.

689
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,200
Will you tell him that it's Mr. Joshua
Benjamin from the NAACP on the line?

690
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,240
No, ma'am, actually, you'll
be of a great deal of help.

691
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,920
I have a few minor questions.
I would like to know...

692
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,480
how many members of the chairman's
committee are African-Americans.

693
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,120
None. Well, I'm sure you have
a Latino member on the committee.

694
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,240
No Latinos either.

695
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,040
Does the chairman have any Asians or
any Native Americans on the committee?

696
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,440
No Asians and no natives.

697
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,560
Does the chairman have any handicaps
or gays on the committee?

698
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,200
No gays. Well, you've been
of a great deal of help.

699
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,760
Just forget I even called.
Just tell him I said hi.

700
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,680
Okay, um, Armando, Van Dyke,
you guys are up next.

701
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,240
I'll go hit 'em with
the Urban League right away.

702
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,280
Fine. And I'll be the conference of
Southern Baptist Bishops. [Chuckling]

703
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,160
What do you want me to do?

704
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,800
Oh, hi. We haven't met yet.

705
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,320
I'm Loretta Hicks.
Congressman Johnson's office?

706
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,880
Oh, hi. I'm Kimberly Meadows.
I work for Chairman Dodge.

707
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,280
Power and Industry.
How'd you get that job?

708
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,400
I used to serve under
the other Congressman Johnson,

709
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,520
so I had the right experience.

710
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,000
Well, I hope you haven't
been bothered by the pickets.

711
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,440
What pickets?

712
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,400
Oh. Did, did I let
the cat out of the bag?

713
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,680
- Are we gonna be picketed?
- Look, you've got to promise...

714
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,600
not to say where
you heard this from.

715
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,880
- Not even my congressman knows.
- I promise.

716
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,400
Okay. My boyfriend works
at the Rainbow Coalition,

717
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,760
and he said...

718
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,080
[Telephone Ringing]

719
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,320
[Telephone Ringing]

720
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,280
Congressman Johnson's office.
Chairman Dodge?

721
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,000
Yes. Okay.

722
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,840
That was Dodge.
He wants to see you pronto.

723
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So we still haven't
lost our touch.

724
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,760
Asi.

725
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,560
He should be back in a moment,
Congressman Johnson.

726
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,480
[Thomas]
Oh! They're here now.

727
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,440
- We haven't met. Eli Hawkins.
- How ya doin'?

728
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,000
Brother Eli. Yeah. All right.

729
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,680
- All right. Thomas Johnson.
- Yes, I know. The Florida upset.

730
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,320
Now that you're here,
what are you gonna do with it?

731
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,040
You gonna feather your own nest, or are
you gonna make something of your office?

732
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,200
Hey, I'm gonna be as good a congressmen
as anybody else up here, all right?

733
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,160
Exactly what does that mean?

734
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,400
Well, uh, ever since
I got back from, from 'Nam...

735
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,240
I personally wanna do something
about the rain forests.

736
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,600
Well, do me a favor. Don't tell me.
I've just had my lunch.

737
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,480
Eli, you're gonna
have to excuse us. Thomas and I
are late for a meeting. Come on in.

738
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,400
What's his problem?

739
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,320
Uh, Mr. Chairman, I have been meaning
to ask your advice about something.

740
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,120
I'm always available
to a young man from my state.

741
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,320
Great. It's about
committee assignments.

742
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,600
Now that's interesting. That's just
the thing I had in mind. Go ahead.

743
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,280
For the last two days,
I have been getting approached...

744
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,640
by a bunch of chairmen
from different committees.

745
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,680
I've been approached by the people
from Foreign Affairs.

746
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,920
I've been approached by the people
from Ways and Means and Armed Services.

747
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,120
They all want me on their committees
and I don't know why.

748
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,480
- I'll be damned!
- You can understand my dilemma,
'cause it's like,

749
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,720
with Foreign Affairs, you get to
fly off to Paris whenever you want.

750
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,600
With Armed Services,
they got bases all over the globe.

751
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,640
Son, are you familiar with
my committee? Power and Industry?

752
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,760
Oh, yeah. But, uh, it's not as well
known as these other committees.

753
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,520
Well, maybe not, but you've
been very frank with me.

754
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,360
I'm gonna be
extremely frank with you.

755
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,640
These other committees,
they're nickel-and-dime stuff.

756
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,200
Power and Industry,
think of what we cover.

757
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,560
Energy, transportation,
insurance, the environment.

758
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,280
Hell, son, there's no better
committee on the Hill.

759
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,160
That is, if you're interested
in fund-raising.

760
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,960
I am, very much. It's just that these
other chairmen made pretty strong cases.

761
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,120
These other chairmen
aren't from your home state.

762
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,960
Hmm.

763
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,760
They're not offering
to take you under their wing.

764
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,680
- Look out for your future.
- And you are?

765
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,720
Hell yes, I am.

766
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,160
Oh, well, I'm very flattered,
Mr. Chairman.

767
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,640
Dick.

768
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,840
- Well, I'm very flattered, Mr. Dick.
- No, no, no, no.

769
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,560
- Oh, I'm sorry, Chairman Dick.
- No, Dick. Just Dick.

770
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,480
- Oh, Dick. Just plain old Dick.
- Yeah.

771
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Fine. I know you don't
get something for nothing.
What do you want from me, Dick?

772
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,480
[Chuckles] Well, son,
I want an able lieutenant.

773
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,920
And I want you to smile
for the cameras.

774
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,320
Skeeter, you know Thomas Johnson,
the new member of the committee?

775
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,440
Thomas, this is
Barclay Warburton.

776
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,800
- How are you, Barclay?
- Skeeter, please.

777
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,920
- Been called that since boarding school.
- Oh, sorry, man.

778
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,800
- Cheers.
- Yeah, cheers. Skeeter.

779
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,640
Thomas, please. Been called that
since reform school.

780
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,640
This EPA oversight hearing
of the committee on Power
and Industry will come to order.

781
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,960
I would like to welcome
our first witness,

782
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,480
the distinguished administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency.

783
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,760
But before I do,
I would like to note that we
have a new member joining us today.

784
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,680
The distinguished gentleman
from Florida.

785
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,960
[Photographer] Congressman Johnson?
Sir, can we get a shot, please?

786
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,520
- Thank you.
- How am I doing?

787
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,400
Great. Great.

788
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,080
Well, Mike, enjoy
those hors d'oeuvres.

789
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:39,080
[Indistinct Chatter]

790
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,920
Hi. My name is Miss Loretta,
and I'd like it...

791
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,400
very much if you'd sign
one of these little name tags.

792
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,360
That would be just nice.

793
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,640
It's an informal breakfast. You give us
your point of view, we give you, uh,

794
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,200
bacon and eggs
plus a $2,000 honorarium.

795
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,600
For your favorite charity,
of course.

796
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,160
The Thomas Jefferson Johnson
Foundation.

797
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,840
Oh, okay. An honorarium.

798
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,800
I like the way that sounds.

799
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,600
[Man] Excuse me.
Nice to see you.

800
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,800
[Thomas]
Excuse me a second.

801
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,720
- Hi.
- Hello.

802
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,120
- How are you? Very nice
to meet you, Miss Celia Kirby.
- Good, thank you.

803
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,480
It's a extremely beautiful name
for an extremely beautiful woman.

804
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,600
Well, my, that was very smooth.

805
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,920
You know, after about ten hours
straight on my feet,

806
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,400
making small talk, breathing in
that cheap cigar smoke,

807
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,040
that is exactly the kind of line
I'm ready to fall for.

808
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,280
- [Chuckling] Slow down, okay?
- Sure.

809
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,360
Tell me, which one of these guys
is Congressman Johnson?

810
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,320
- You're looking for the congressman?
- Yes.

811
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,440
How would you feel if I told you
I was the congressman? Aha!

812
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,920
- Oh, duh!
- I'm so sorry.

813
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,560
Would you give me two seconds to take
my foot out of my mouth, please?

814
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,080
Take all the time you need.
Can we start over again?

815
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,400
Yes, Celia Kirby,
Legislative Director of Pro Bono.

816
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,960
Celia kirby from Pro Bono!
Very nice to meet you.

817
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,320
- Yes.
- Would you tell me something?

818
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,560
Are all the pro bonettes
as fine as you?

819
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,240
Pro Bono is a public interest
research and advocacy group.

820
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,760
I'd be delighted to brief you
on our priorities this session.

821
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,400
Do you think, perhaps, I could call
your A.A. and be put on your schedule?

822
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,320
- Call my A.A.?
- Yes.

823
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,480
No, you don't have to call my A.A.
Why don't we do this?

824
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,760
Why don't we, say now, go out to
dinner? You can brief me at dinner.

825
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,120
I'd like an appointment,
Congressman, not a date.

826
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,240
We could write it up
as an appointment,

827
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,280
but we'll have, like,
flowers and dinner,

828
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,560
a mandolin, and it'll be
a "floral" appointment.

829
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,240
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Congressman.
I will be in touch with your staff.

830
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,160
There's one other thing.
I'm particularly interested...

831
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,440
in hearing your view on extending
the sexual harassment law
to include congressmen.

832
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,840
Oh. I get it.

833
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,120
Can we turn the A.C. down, please?

834
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,400
Thank you.

835
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,640
Uh, I have a confession to make.
I don't know very much about poultry.

836
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,600
But I do know people,

837
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,600
and I like you people.
I really do.

838
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,320
And if you people come to me
and you say to me...

839
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,080
that you have something to say
important about poultry,

840
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,760
I'm gonna listen.
Thank you very much.

841
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,560
Thank you for seeing us.
We won't take up much of your time.

842
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,480
- This is Ira Schecter,
our research director.
- Hi, Ira, how are you?

843
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,480
This is Mr. Reinhardt.
You remember him?

844
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,520
Come sit next to me
and have this chitchat.

845
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,600
I've been dying to talk to you
about these issues.

846
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,560
Sit, everybody, sit.
Come on.

847
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
- All right.
- We can take as long as we want.

848
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,560
Congressman, you do have
several people waiting.

849
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,480
- No, no, they can wait.
- They can wait.

850
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,520
What are you doing standing, Ira?
Sit down, Ira!

851
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,440
Uh, sure.

852
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,640
Well... [Clears Throat]
These are issue papers.

853
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,760
- Ah.
- This session we're
targeting child safety,

854
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,440
auto insurance premiums
and food additives.

855
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,640
Certainly, as the votes come up, you'll
be hearing plenty from the other side.

856
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,320
We simply would like a fair shot
at making our case too.

857
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,600
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

858
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,360
Okay, now, let's talk about car
insurance. What are you paying, Ira?

859
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,520
- Me? Oh.
- [Thomas] Yes.

860
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,560
Uh, well, I have an '82
Dodge Dart and, uh,

861
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,000
I pay about $650 a year,
or so.

862
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,360
Six hundred fifty dollars?
Man, that's highway robbery.

863
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,440
A chop shop wouldn't give you more
than 230 on a junker like that.

864
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,360
Or so I've heard.

865
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,640
Hey, look,
I'm flying blind here.

866
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,960
What we need to do is for you
to put together a little package.

867
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,240
Put a package together
for me and we'll sit down.

868
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,680
We'll block aside two Saturday evenings
and we can discuss it then.

869
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,720
Well, I don't see any problem
with arranging that.

870
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,800
Once again, you've been more than
generous with your time, Congressman.

871
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,160
What are you doin'?
I clear my whole calendar and you're
in and outta here in five minutes?

872
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,160
Look, sit down.
We haven't discussed child safety yet.

873
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,720
Ira, sit. I'm gonna slap you.
Sit. Come on, down. Sit down!

874
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,560
Let's finish talking.
Let's talk about child safety now.

875
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,960
This is an important issue.
Child safety.

876
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,920
Well, we are sponsoring a bill imposing
safety standards on imported toys.

877
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,240
Great. I hate imported toys.
Hate 'em.

878
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,880
I wish they didn't exist.
Especially those little baseball men...

879
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,800
with the springs in their neck that do
this. What is that? Fuck that, right?

880
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,520
- Fuck that.
- [Thomas] Yeah, I hate that.

881
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,880
Why don't we do this? Like I said,
put the package together.

882
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,160
We'll block aside a couple of Saturday
evenings and we can discuss it...

883
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,600
- And you can take me
through all the ins and outs.
- "Ins and outs"?

884
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,800
I'd like to do
more money for you,

885
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,120
but first I've got to get
your positions on a few issues.

886
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,120
Now where are you
on sugar price supports?

887
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,000
- Sugar price supports.
- Hmm?

888
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,080
- Where should I be, Terry?
- Shit, it makes no difference to me.

889
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,960
If you're for 'em, I got money
for you from my sugar producers
in Louisiana and Hawaii.

890
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,200
If you're against 'em, I got money
for you from the candy manufacturers.

891
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,280
- You pick.
- Let's say... for.

892
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,760
Yeah, for. For.

893
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,760
How about putting limits
on malpractice awards?

894
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,600
Oh, you tell me.

895
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,800
If you're for 'em, I got money from
the doctors and insurance companies.

896
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,320
If you're against 'em,
I got money from the trial lawyers.

897
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,040
- Let's put you down as against.
- Yeah, you know what?
Put me down for against.

898
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,080
How about pizza?

899
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,320
Oh, no, this salad
is gonna be enough for me.

900
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,840
Not for lunch, old buddy.
For PAC money.

901
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,000
You thought I was serious?
I was fuckin' with you.

902
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,520
- Well, you are. You are!
- Fuckin' with you. Uh, duh!

903
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,840
Terry, tell me something.

904
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,000
With all this money
comin' in from both sides,

905
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,200
how could anything
possibly ever get done?

906
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,400
It doesn't.
That's the genius of the system.

907
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,600
[Thomas, Terry Laugh]

908
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,680
Hey, baby, put down nuclear
power for ten G's.

909
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,600
Mambo!

910
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,160
[Loretta]
Cool! Yeah, the congressman's
gonna be out your way next week.

911
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,280
Mr. Willie? Congressman Johnson
calling. Can you take his call?

912
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,240
Thank you. Please hold.

913
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,240
A-one, a-two...

914
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,240
Yes, Mr. Brown.
Uh-huh, on the 30th.

915
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,240
We were wondering whether
you aerospace people...

916
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,600
might want to lay on a luncheon
so that you can hear his views.

917
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Willie.
He just picked up another call.

918
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,680
I know why he was calling you. He hasn't
heard from you about his fund-raiser.

919
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,520
A thousand dollars a head?
A whole table!

920
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,640
Lovely. Yeah.

921
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,040
Well, now, what kind of
a contribution to his foundation
were you folks thinking about?

922
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,240
Now, we'll have a little
huntin' in the morning,

923
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,280
little fishin' in the afternoon,

924
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,840
clean air, beautiful scenery.

925
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,840
All to work up a good appetite,
'cause we got a fine French chef...

926
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,800
back at the lodge
flown in special.

927
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,960
Oh! That's very, very nice.

928
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,040
- You don't want anything from us?
- We would enjoy the opportunity...

929
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,000
to share our views.

930
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,640
You see, we feel that the semiautomatic
weapon's gotten a bad rap.

931
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,280
Now, the gun control nuts try to make
out that they're for drug dealers only.

932
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,520
But, uh, really, they're just guns
for the ordinary sportsman.

933
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:24,360
[Chuckling]
Nothin' like a nice, warm Uzi.

934
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,920
[Duck Call Quacking]

935
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,640
[Duck Call Continues]

936
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,920
[Quacking]

937
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,440
Yee-hee!

938
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,240
Must have had a heart attack.

939
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,320
Aaah!

940
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,400
And according to the 1988 study,
it showed eight per 100,000.

941
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,400
- Am I losing you on these
mortality rates, Congressman?
- No, not at all.

942
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,120
I was, uh, I was just wondering
how much of this is a statutory problem,

943
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,120
- And how much of it is a regulatory one.
- Mmm, mm-hmm.

944
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,600
- Didn't the Merton Act
cover most of this?
- Excellent point.

945
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,880
Excellent point.
Let me check something out.

946
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,040
Excuse me.

947
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,600
You're absolutely right.

948
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,880
Maybe we could get them
to amend Merton.

949
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,560
Oh, get 'em to amend it.

950
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,520
Yes!

951
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,520
Get 'em to amend it, huh?
Well, "For Merton to apply,

952
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,120
you have to show high contagion.

953
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,800
It sounds to me like
your contagion... rates...

954
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,280
are no higher
than the common clod."

955
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,960
"Cold." "Common cold."

956
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,080
Excuse me a second. Arthur!

957
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,600
- Ow!
- What were we talking about?

958
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,640
How'd you wind up hustling for pro bono
instead of pesticides anyway?

959
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,600
- 'Cause you could have
been a big-time lawyer.
- I was for a while.

960
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,920
- But it depressed me.
- What could be depressing
about makin' $100,000 a year?

961
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,320
- I know you gotta get sick
of losin' all the time.
- Of course I do.

962
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Mainly it makes me angry,
and the anger keeps me going.

963
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,040
Of course I'd like to win a few
and I'm not allergic to money either.

964
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,040
- So why are you doin' it?
- Hey.

965
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,360
It's so embarrassing to come
right out and say why I do it.

966
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,240
- Why?
- It's embarrassing for me to say.

967
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,280
- I just feel...
- Stop! What?

968
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,320
Meaning!

969
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,840
My life has to mean something.

970
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,400
So now I have a question for you.

971
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,200
I'd like to know how you
got named after a memorial.

972
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,720
Oh.
[Chuckling]

973
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,800
My grandmother liked Jefferson.
You know, "life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness."

974
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,040
You know,
old black folks' thing.

975
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:35,800
There's a lot to live up to, so I
kinda specialize in one portion of that.

976
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,440
That's the pursuit
of happiness.

977
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,080
- And how's it going?
- Um.

978
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,120
- Honestly?
- Mm-hmm.

979
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,120
I was goin' real good
'til I met you.

980
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,520
Now, the better I do,
the worse I feel.

981
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,120
Isn't that strange?

982
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,360
Mmm, when can I see you again?
Let's go to dinner Saturday night.

983
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,080
- How about Sunday morning?
- Oh, oh, brunch?

984
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,360
The wages of sin is death!

985
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,680
And to the man who values
gold over goodness,

986
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,680
the Lord allows no exemptions.

987
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,600
- [Congregation] Amen.
- Amen.

988
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,960
And to the man
who shows no respect...

989
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,080
for the privilege
of walking this Earth,

990
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,040
the Lord allows no deductions.

991
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,720
- Amen.
- And to the man whose
pockets are bulging...

992
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,280
and whose soul is empty,

993
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,080
the Lord grants
no 90-day extension.

994
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,240
And when the last trump sounds,

995
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,440
believe me,
you will be audited.

996
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,000
This is a wonderful date.

997
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,480
Oh, darling,
I'm glad you could make it!

998
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,000
Oh, I love that sermon,
Uncle Eli.

999
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,000
This is your uncle?

1000
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,880
Yes, my niece tells me you're
not half as slimy as I thought.

1001
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,960
That puts you somewhere between a lizard
and a toad. Quite a step up, huh?

1002
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,880
Thank you very much.

1003
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,120
Forgive me for staring. I don't know
how I missed the family resemblance.

1004
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,400
She's you in a skirt.

1005
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,680
[TV Announcer]... trailing by 13
as we begin the second half.

1006
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,880
[Man] Yeah, I guess we're
all bringin' our wives.

1007
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,440
Al, you gonna bring your wife,
ain't ya?

1008
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,560
[Al Chuckling]
You bet.

1009
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,200
[TV Continues Indistinct]

1010
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,640
Uh-huh. Uh.

1011
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,880
[TV Continues Indistinct]

1012
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,840
Oh, I slipped.

1013
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,840
- Ellie.
- How ya doin', Thomas?

1014
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,080
I need your help
on the ethics bill, Leon.

1015
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,920
- I want you to cosponsor my amendments.
- You make a persuasive case, Eli.

1016
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,080
But that wasn't a yes.

1017
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,560
I promise to give it
the attention it deserves.

1018
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,120
- Better luck next time, son.
- Yeah, man, you're so good.
He's so good.

1019
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,200
He took $600 off you
that last hand, didn't he?

1020
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,320
- He took a real shinin' to me.
- If I didn't know any better,

1021
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,560
I'd say you lost to him
on purpose.

1022
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,720
There's nothin' wrong with lettin'
the head of the ethics committee...

1023
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,640
roll ya every now and then.

1024
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,200
You know, you're gonna fit in
real good around here. Too good.

1025
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,760
How come you never ask me
to help you out with your amendments?

1026
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,160
Oh, come on, Thomas.
Give it a rest.

1027
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,640
Everybody knows
you're Dick Dodge's boy.

1028
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,080
Hey, man, I ain't
nobody's boy, all right?

1029
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,200
Don't waste your outrage on me.
I know what ya are.

1030
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,280
- I am no different than
anybody else up here, okay?
- That's not true.

1031
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,920
You see, some people here actually do
something besides saving their own ass.

1032
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,160
You know, just then you
reminded me of my father.

1033
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,600
Did I really? How so?

1034
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,200
He used to say I was a scumbag too.

1035
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,360
[Bell Ringing]

1036
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,280
Aren't you going to vote?

1037
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,880
Is that what that means?
You know, all this time I've
been listenin' to that shit,

1038
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,800
thinkin' it was time for
Final Jeopardy or somethin'.

1039
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,320
[Chuckling]

1040
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,320
[Indistinct Chatter]

1041
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,440
- [Thomas] Excuse me.
- Excuse me, Congressman.

1042
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,080
- I'm Mrs. Koslowski.
- Hi, I'm leaving.

1043
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,600
We were just learning how a bill
becomes a law. Was that a vote?

1044
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,760
Yes, that was a vote in there.
Oh! Oh!

1045
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,320
Yes, that was a vote.
A vote was made. Bye-bye.

1046
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,640
- And what did you vote?
- Ah, I voted nay.

1047
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,920
It was a terrible bill and it would have
destroyed the fabric of American life.

1048
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,880
What was the vote on?

1049
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,200
[Chuckling]
Rafe!

1050
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,560
Rafe, will you talk to these nice
people. Explain to them about the vote.

1051
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,640
Well, it was a motion on the
previous question on the rule.

1052
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,920
No, it was a motion
on the recommitment...

1053
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,600
of the rule of the motion
of the previous question.

1054
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,680
- Which means?
- Clean air.

1055
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,040
School lunches.

1056
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,720
Ah, you see the difficult choices
we have to make here, kids,

1057
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,960
between clean air
and school lunches, okay?

1058
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,520
That's why I want to be the education
congressman. See, 'cause I feel...

1059
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,040
that American students should be able to
eat lunch and breathe at the same time.

1060
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,880
And I see an America where
there's no such thing...

1061
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,440
as a student
who is below average.

1062
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,920
And I think it is wrong when students
have to stay up late at night...

1063
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,080
and miss all the good shows
doing homework.

1064
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,840
Then get up early in the mornin'
and go to school.

1065
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,520
This sort of thing just is not fair.

1066
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:11,160
[Cheering]

1067
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,560
- Uh, good morning. May I help you?
- Yes, I'm Ellen Juba.

1068
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,520
- This is my daughter, Mickey.
- Hi.

1069
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,960
We'd like to see our congressman.
We live in the district.

1070
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,600
Just a moment, please.

1071
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,080
Ah, could you come out?
Thank you.

1072
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,640
Be right with you.
I like your hat.

1073
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,800
How do you do? I'm Miss Loretta,
public liaison for the congressman.

1074
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,960
Ellen Juba, my daughter, Mickey.
We'd like to see him.

1075
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,560
Y'all from the district?
Up here seeing the sights?

1076
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,760
How'd you folks like some
gallery passes? Go listen
to the great debates of our day.

1077
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,440
We don't wanna go to the gallery.
We wanna see Congressman Johnson.

1078
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,000
Well, how about a house key ring?
For each of you?

1079
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,560
Here, see that? Isn't that
something? Turns into a pen.

1080
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,480
I don't think you understand.
We're not tourists. We're constituents.

1081
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,320
You're not with some organization,
are you, honey?

1082
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,680
I'm a goddamn citizen.
Isn't that enough?

1083
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,200
Do you have an appointment?

1084
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,320
No, I do not have
an appointment, because y'all
keep givin' me the runaround.

1085
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,240
Well, I'm sorry, but the congressman
is a very busy man.

1086
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,280
Now, if you'd like to discuss it
with me, I will personally...

1087
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,240
go over the issue with him
and get a letter out to you.

1088
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,560
We're not leaving here
until we see him.

1089
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,480
Armando, would you come out front?
We have a situation.

1090
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,840
You stop palming me off
on your flunkies.

1091
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,120
Are you gonna go in there
and tell him we're out here...

1092
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,080
or am I gonna go in there
and tell him myself?

1093
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,000
- Excuse me, may I help you, please?
- Yes, you can.

1094
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,840
- I would like to see
my congressman, please.
- He's not here today.

1095
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,400
- I bet he is here. Excuse me.
- No, no, please, lady.

1096
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,360
- No, you just let me by!
- No, don't push. Okay. Ya! Ya!

1097
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,800
- [Indistinct Shouting]
- I am sick of this! I am fed up!

1098
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,080
- I have every right! Let go of her!
- Hey!

1099
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,840
Oh, baby.

1100
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,480
Come on, Mama. Let's go.

1101
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,760
Hey.

1102
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,320
What happened to you?

1103
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,320
The doctor says they got it all.
I'm gonna be okay.

1104
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,000
I was lucky, but,
but there are others.

1105
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:44,840
- What others?
- Other kids. They call it
a cancer cluster.

1106
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,520
At first, none of us in the neighborhood
wanted to believe it.

1107
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,440
But then we all saw it.

1108
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,160
For me, it was when the two-year-old
across the street...

1109
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,280
developed a brain tumor
same as Mickey's.

1110
01:04:55,360 --> 01:05:00,320
We looked at everything:
the water, the air, dump sites.

1111
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,280
Insects, you name it.

1112
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,840
And then we realized it was
starin' us right in the face.

1113
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,280
- What?
- Power lines.

1114
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,280
High-voltage power lines.

1115
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:17,080
The wires cause magnetic fields
and the magnetic fields cause cancer,

1116
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,040
especially in children.

1117
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,600
I've never heard anything
like that in my life.

1118
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,680
Why don't you just
come see for yourself?

1119
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,960
[Children Laughing]

1120
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,320
- This is Mickey's school?
- Uh-huh.

1121
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,680
It turns out a lot of schools
are near power lines.

1122
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,640
Land's cheap, so schools tend
to buy it from the power companies.

1123
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:53,000
We're nobody, Congressman.
You're somebody.

1124
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:57,800
- We need your help.
- [Sighing]

1125
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,000
Will you excuse me
for a second? Come here.

1126
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,280
- Is this real?
- That depends on who you ask.

1127
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,640
Some people say it's worse
than asbestos or breast implants.

1128
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,560
Others say it's coincidental.

1129
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,520
Well, you. What do you say?

1130
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,760
I think it's very suspicious that the
White House would kill an EPA report...

1131
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,480
saying that power lines
probably cause cancer.

1132
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,480
- They did that?
- Yes.

1133
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,480
[Sighing]

1134
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,840
Well, I gotta do somethin'
to help these people.

1135
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,320
Don't tell me you're actually
developing a conscience.

1136
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,520
Oh, God, I hope not. It'd be
a fuckin' nuisance in Congress.

1137
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,560
But if I were,
what could I do to help them?

1138
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,600
This goes beyond personal tragedy.

1139
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,040
It goes to a public health hazard
of unknown proportions.

1140
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,400
It goes to the right of the ordinary
people to know all the facts!

1141
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,920
Yeah, people ought to know if
the neighborhoods are killing them.

1142
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,400
Amen, gentlemen.

1143
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,080
Amen! And what a fine effort it is.
I'm totally sympathetic.

1144
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,080
Congressional hearings should
be scheduled just as soon as possible.

1145
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,040
The American people
deserve no less.

1146
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,880
Message: we care.

1147
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,720
Turn this way, please.

1148
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,040
- Right here, sir. Great!
- Over here.

1149
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,120
[Thundering]

1150
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,200
Cheers.

1151
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,520
You know, son,
you're a real comer.

1152
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,160
I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if you ended up in the leadership.

1153
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,520
I'll say this,
if I were speaker,

1154
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,600
I'd sleep better with you
as a lieutenant.

1155
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,920
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

1156
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,840
'Cause I really honestly didn't
think you was gonna go with me
on this power lines thing.

1157
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,760
- But I'm not.
- But you said you're sympathetic.

1158
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,840
Well, of course I did. We're all
sympathetic to little girls with cancer.

1159
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,200
But I'm not sympathetic
to holding a public inquiry.

1160
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,440
- You just said...
- I know what I said.

1161
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,800
But sound bites
aren't sworn testimony.

1162
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:57,600
Now look, son, it's great to get
your name in the newspaper.

1163
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,760
Let 'em know you care.
Very smart move, Thomas.

1164
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,120
But that's as far as I
would go with this if I were you.

1165
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,120
[Intercom Buzzing]

1166
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,560
Yeah? Oh, fine, fine.

1167
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,160
No, no, no, send 'em in.

1168
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,320
We've got some
unexpected visitors.

1169
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,760
- Hope you don't mind.
- Oh, hell, no.

1170
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,000
Sure, great.

1171
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,000
[Laughing]
Mr. Chairman!

1172
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,960
Olaf!

1173
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,600
- Hello, Terry.
- Evenin', Mr. Chairman.

1174
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,720
Thanks for tak...
Thomas!

1175
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,880
They let you in here,
you S.O.B.?

1176
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,880
You folks finally gonna
get to press flesh. Olaf!

1177
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,880
Come and meet Thomas Johnson.
Thomas, Olaf Andersen.

1178
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,240
- Chairman, Gulf Coast Power.
- Glad to meet ya, son.

1179
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,600
They tell me you got
a real talent for the game.

1180
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:52,360
This is Zeke Bridges, CEO,
Superior Mutual Insurance.

1181
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,560
Som-bitch.

1182
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,280
- Oh, you two know each other?
- Ah, no, we haven't met.

1183
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,320
But I know a great deal
about the man.

1184
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,600
We share a common interest
in international affairs.

1185
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,000
Swedish in particular.

1186
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:15,240
Oh, another Rolex. I collect these.
Mine's a slightly older model.

1187
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,280
Can I have a double bourbon,
please?

1188
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,880
It is very nice finally
meeting you, Mr. Bridges.

1189
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,960
Yes, it's nice to meet you,
Congressman.

1190
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:28,040
Thomas and I were just talkin'
about, uh, power lines.

1191
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,880
Man, I think we oughta
have those hearings.

1192
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,080
Well, now look, Thomas, why don't
we get, uh, Olaf's take on this?

1193
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,920
Well, it's tragic.
Cancer's a terrible thing.

1194
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,920
But there's no way you
can link it to power lines.

1195
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,880
- The truth is...
- Wait a minute,
there have been studies...

1196
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,000
Every study that says one thing,
I'll show you a study saying another.

1197
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,800
We've studied this ourselves.
Nada.

1198
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,880
What if all you guys
are wrong?

1199
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,640
Thomas, do you want us
to move the power lines?

1200
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,520
You know how much it would cost to bury
those things in Florida alone?

1201
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,920
- We're talkin' $5 billion.
- Not counting the liability claims.

1202
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,480
How would you like
the people in your district
to think of you as the fellow...

1203
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,360
who tripled
their electric bill?

1204
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,280
I just thought that if
we had the hearings...

1205
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,480
Think for a moment, chum.
You hold your hearings.

1206
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,080
Overnight, everyone who
lives near a substation...

1207
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,920
will find the value
of his home in the toilet.

1208
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,760
- You'll kill the real estate market.
- You'll kill the insurance companies.

1209
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,880
- You'll kill the school district.
- You'll kill the local economy.

1210
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,960
[Thundering]

1211
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,240
Son, system ain't perfect.

1212
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,800
But the fleas come with the dog.

1213
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,080
Maybe I should
think about it, huh?

1214
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,080
- Atta boy.
- [Clearing Throat]

1215
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,680
Oh, Thomas, on a completely
different subject here.

1216
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,920
You haven't set up
a state PAC yet, have ya?

1217
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,760
'Cause I'd be happy to start one off
with a contribution of, say, 200,000.

1218
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,720
No strings attached.

1219
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,280
Natch.

1220
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,000
- You were beautiful, Olaf.
- No, you were beautiful, Dick.

1221
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:21,520
- No, you were beautiful, Terry.
- To the mutual aid society.

1222
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,560
- Hey.
- Hi.

1223
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,640
So? Are the Jubas
gonna testify? Hmm?

1224
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,640
When's the committee
holding hearings?

1225
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:53,360
Um, actually, I think the, the hearings
might be postponed a little bit.

1226
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,360
What's Dodge pulling now?

1227
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,920
Nothin'. It's actually kinda good,
'cause now I get to, you know...

1228
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,840
Get to round up some other members
and get my ducks in a row and...

1229
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,720
[Laughing]

1230
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,480
- You shafted me on the ethics bill!
- Hey, Eli!

1231
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,000
You just missed a good one.
Wait a minute, that reminds me.

1232
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,360
- Same two old men on a park bench...
- It's a closed rule!

1233
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,280
I can't get my amendments on the floor!
I can't get a recorded vote.

1234
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,240
I can't get squat!

1235
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,960
This is not the rules committee.
This is the steam room.

1236
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,920
This is the U.S. Congress. The American
people deserve better than this!

1237
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,560
You know what your problem is, Eli?
You've got "sermonitis."

1238
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,880
[Laughing]

1239
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,560
Now, why don't you just relax?
Have a massage.

1240
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,840
I've got news for ya, Dick.
I'm gonna run against you for speaker.

1241
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,360
I'm gonna make this
whole race boil down...

1242
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,160
to whether we want a sleaze like you
in the speaker's chair.

1243
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,760
I'll bet ya $100
you don't get ten votes.

1244
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,680
[Sighing]
I'm gonna be your shadow, Dick.

1245
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,400
Every member ya strong-arm,
every reporter ya background,

1246
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,640
every talk show ya go on,
I'll be there.

1247
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,440
Five votes!
Nobody likes to hear a sermon.

1248
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,080
I may not have a rat's ass
of a chance to beat you,

1249
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,480
but I sure as hell
can let the world know...

1250
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,360
what you stand for.

1251
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,040
I went too far with him.
I know it.

1252
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,960
- Now you know him
pretty well, don't you?
- I wouldn't say I knew him well.

1253
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,080
Oh, come on, Thomas,
you're seein' his niece.

1254
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,200
- Hell, you've been out
to his damn church.
- How do you know that?

1255
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,120
Because I keep my ear
to the ground.

1256
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,400
Now, Thomas,
he'll listen to you.

1257
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,880
I want you to go make
the peace between us.

1258
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,320
Tell him we'll work something out
with his amendments.

1259
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,640
Not a vote, I won't go that far.
But at least he'll get to say
his peace from the floor.

1260
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,760
Just get him off of my back.

1261
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,160
- Another round?
- Yeah, why not?

1262
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,240
To the honorable Dick Dodge.

1263
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,800
Hey.

1264
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,800
By the time I'm finished with him,
he won't be speaker.

1265
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,880
He'll be lucky
if they don't indict him.

1266
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,720
Eli, people do things that they regret,
man. People make mistakes.

1267
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,120
- Dick's been under
a lot of pressure lately.
- Come on!

1268
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,280
Thomas, you're
Dick Dodge's yes-man.

1269
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,840
I am not a yes-man.
When Dick says no, I say no.

1270
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,840
I know what you're up to.
He's scared and this is damage control.

1271
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,560
Yeah, well, you know what?
This town...

1272
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,320
It isn't about
passin' laws anymore.

1273
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,720
It isn't about
doing good anymore.

1274
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,400
All it's about...
is bein' here.

1275
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,680
[Loretta]
Well, as I live and breathe.

1276
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,040
- Hey, cuz.
- Hey.

1277
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,960
Oh, I'm sorry. This is
Miss Loretta Hicks from my staff.

1278
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,480
- This is Congressman Hawkins.
- Pleasure to meet you.

1279
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,080
Oh, would you like a drink?

1280
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:01,560
You know, you two look like you
could use a designated driver.

1281
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,200
- Oh, good samaritan.
- Praise 'em.

1282
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,920
[Dispatcher] Number 22,
I got a pickup at the Regency,

1283
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,080
going to National.

1284
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,480
You want a girlfriend?

1285
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,880
[Dispatcher]
Eighteen, Union Station.

1286
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,840
Shit!

1287
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,600
[Indistinct Yelling]

1288
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,440
[Indistinct]

1289
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,200
Oh, shit.

1290
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,880
Yeah, I need
an ambulance right away.

1291
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,000
[Telephone Beeping]
Hello?

1292
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,280
- It's somebody called Thomas Johnson.
- Oh.

1293
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,600
- What's wrong?
- I went out with Hawkins.

1294
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,480
We got in an accident.
He's out cold. I'm okay though.

1295
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,120
- Were you driving?
- No, it was Miss Loretta.

1296
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,400
- The girl from your office?
- Yeah. Hey, look, man.

1297
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,520
I don't like the way
this looks for anybody, okay?

1298
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,480
You said you wanted to
get back in Hawkins' good graces.
This is your opportunity.

1299
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,800
All right. Now you listen
to me very carefully.

1300
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,520
I want you to tell the ambulance
to take you to Walter Reed Hospital.

1301
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,160
It's a privilege they extend
to congressmen. They'll keep it quiet.

1302
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:01,640
I'll handle the police and you go home.
Keep your mouth shut.

1303
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,760
[Beeping]

1304
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,040
- [Ringing]
- What? What? What?

1305
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:12,520
Hello? Hello?
Mr... . Mr... . Mr. Chairman?

1306
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,000
Um, um, um,
no, no, no, no, sir.

1307
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,560
No, no, I'm,
I'm, I'm a night owl.

1308
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,200
Uh-huh, um...

1309
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,520
Oh, my God,
is, is he all right?

1310
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,480
G-Good, good, good.
Um, and, and Eli and Loretta?

1311
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:35,400
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1312
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,040
Uh-huh.

1313
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,960
That's brilliant,
Mr. Chairman.

1314
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:44,000
No, I'll call the morning shows and
leak the information. They'll eat it up.

1315
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,520
At the top of the news,
Maryland Congressman Elijah Hawkins...

1316
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:50,600
is in satisfactory condition
at Walter Reed Hospital...

1317
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,640
after an overnight accident
in the district.

1318
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:57,040
That's right, Laura. Hawkins
reportedly had alcohol in his blood.

1319
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,400
Also slightly injured was
an unidentified woman whom police say...

1320
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,640
is linked to a phone-sex
operation in Florida.

1321
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,680
- Shit.
- Linda, Congressman Hawkins?

1322
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,080
That's Reverend Hawkins,
isn't it?

1323
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,440
Right you are, Laura. And how this plays
into his longstanding campaign...

1324
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,920
to reform congressional ethics
is now anyone's guess.

1325
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,520
I'm trying to find
Reverend Eli Hawkins.

1326
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,640
[Nurse]
Let me check for you.

1327
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,680
Yes, he's right around
the corner there.

1328
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,160
Stay away from him.
Stay away from me too.

1329
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,160
- Celia, listen, we were set up.
- We were set up?

1330
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,600
You were in the car. I didn't hear
your name mentioned on the news.

1331
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,800
- Somethin' stinks here.
- It sure does,
and guess who it is, Thomas?

1332
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,760
You don't give a damn
about anything, do you?

1333
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,720
To think the other night
I actually thought you cared...

1334
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,440
- About somebody other than yourself.
- You know how I feel about...

1335
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,640
Not me! You jerk!
Mickey Juba.

1336
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,920
You caved on the power lines,
didn't you?

1337
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,720
Don't even answer because I know
you did. What'd you get for it?

1338
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,760
- Are you gonna let me talk?
- Get the hell outta here.

1339
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,640
Get out!

1340
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,400
[Thomas]
Hattie! Hattie Rifkin?

1341
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,440
- Oh, rifkeleh!
- Don't rifkeleh me, you momzer!

1342
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,360
- What the hell do you want?
- Hattie, I wanna talk to you.

1343
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:23,360
I've heard that before,
Mr. Name-You-Know.

1344
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,600
Hattie, I know you got me elected
and I forgot your name in the mornin'.
I'm sorry.

1345
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,480
I'm sorry, but I really, really,
really... I really need you.

1346
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,560
So talk.

1347
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,480
Why are we meetin' here,
Thomas?

1348
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,480
Trouble at the office?

1349
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,080
Well, Dodge says he keeps
his ear to the ground.

1350
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,360
But I know that's bullshit.
He has an inside man.

1351
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,280
- Reinhardt?
- Yes.

1352
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,640
- Let's whack him.
- Hey, this ain't Scarface, all right?

1353
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,320
You got a plan?

1354
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:58,040
Big con.
Dick Dodge is the mark.

1355
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,640
- Dick Dodge?
- Aren't we getting out
of our league here, man?

1356
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,600
This guy's been doin'
the big con for over 30 years.

1357
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,240
Mmm, cuz, these politicians,

1358
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:08,040
these are some serious slick fish.

1359
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,760
Wait a second. Is everybody
goin' soft here all of a sudden?

1360
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,440
Are you all a bunch
of fuckin' incumbents now?

1361
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,040
Listen, Thursday, Dick Dodge
is at the arts caucus, all right?

1362
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,160
I need to know how long it takes
to get from there to the EPA building.

1363
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,040
All right, Armando?
Okay, now.

1364
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,080
Loretta, get some information
on the EPA and give that to the roper.

1365
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,240
I got a list of equipment
I want you to go get.

1366
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,320
- Crazy, baby.
- Hey.

1367
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,040
Don't we need a new roper?
I mean, hey, look, everybody
around here knows our faces.

1368
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,200
- [Car Horn Honking]
- Speak of the devil.

1369
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,840
- My man!
- What up, T?

1370
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:46,880
- Homer!
- What's up?

1371
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,520
Hey, Dick.
Eli Hawkins got his tail...

1372
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,200
- Caught in a crack, huh?
- He did.

1373
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,400
- And you kept my name out of it?
- I did.

1374
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,640
- So I owe you?
- You do.

1375
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,680
This hearing of the committee on Power
and Industry will come to order.

1376
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:12,320
[Dodge] The health
of America's insurance industry...

1377
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,840
Hey, come here. Somethin' came up.
I got a call from an EPA guy.

1378
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,120
Said he heard how fast
I bailed on the power lines.

1379
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,360
He's got something
really hot for me.

1380
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:25,240
He wants to meet me outta the office,
after business hours, like tonight.

1381
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,560
[Thomas]
Mr. Whitney?

1382
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,760
You said you'd be alone.

1383
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,840
What is he doin' here?
What is he, a cop?

1384
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:39,120
You wearin' a wire?
You wearin' a goddamn wire?

1385
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,040
Relax, Mr. Whitney,
I'm not wired.

1386
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,520
Yeah?

1387
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,080
Well, let's see.

1388
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,880
I know you got it.
I just gotta find it, that's all.

1389
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,840
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey, man, I told ya he's okay.

1390
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,800
He's not wired.
Look. He has no wire here.

1391
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,840
No wire. You can trust him.
Look at this guy.

1392
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:03,240
He's got fire engines
on his drawers. This is a good man.
Now cool it. Just relax.

1393
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,600
Is this gonna be
something we can use?

1394
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,720
Your friends at the power company
would be very interested.

1395
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:16,160
- Talk to me.
- All right.

1396
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,080
The White House
is putting heat on the EPA.

1397
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,920
Now we're gonna announce
a major investigation...

1398
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,680
on the relation between power lines
and cancer clusters.

1399
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,760
Mrs. Dodge, it's Arthur Reinhardt.
May I please speak to the chairman?

1400
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:45,760
[Woman On Intercom]
Mr. Andersen? Mr. Bridges is on one.

1401
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,360
Zeke!
How in the hell are ya?

1402
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,120
[As Zeke] I'm madder than a baptist
in a brothel, you som-bitch!

1403
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:55,680
Olaf! You hear about this EPA bullshit?
Why, it could ruin Gulf Coast Power!

1404
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,560
They're goin' ahead with this goddamn
power lines investigation.

1405
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,640
I thought we had this settled.
They don't have any proof.

1406
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,640
They ain't lookin' for proof! They're
lookin' for dinner and we're it!

1407
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,320
I tell ya, I'm about as crazy
as a dog in a hubcap factory.

1408
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,200
[Sighing]
Ah, shit.

1409
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,160
All right, Zeke.

1410
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,680
Zeke, I'm goin' up to D.C.
for the clean air hearings anyway.

1411
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,120
I'll talk to Dodge.

1412
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,560
- Ya got a second?
- Yeah.

1413
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,880
Okay, I heard something. And I know
there's some business in it.

1414
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:28,400
- I'm listening.
- EPA, launching a big
investigation on power lines.

1415
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,360
- They're gettin' a lot
of pressure from the White House.
- That's very interesting.

1416
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,640
I heard the same thing.

1417
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,920
- Nothing gets by you, does it?
- Not much.

1418
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,640
But thank you, son.
I appreciate your sharing that with me.

1419
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:43,720
Okay, so, there's probably
something in it for us.

1420
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,720
Thomas, if we got the EPA
off Olaf Andersen's back,

1421
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,480
he'd be extremely
appreciative.

1422
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,640
- So... how do we go about doin' that?
- My committee.

1423
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:57,120
We audit their funding.
Hell, I got him by the balls.

1424
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:59,400
- So you're just gonna
rip their balls o...
- Oh, no, no, no.

1425
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,320
Thomas, persuasion.

1426
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,800
- Strenuous persuasion.
- Oh, now, that's allowed.

1427
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,680
Persuasion, yes.
Intimidation, no.

1428
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,400
But... it's a gray area.

1429
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,800
- Who's to say which is which?
- Oh!

1430
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,000
Persuasion. You can't rip 'em out.
You have to persuade 'em out.

1431
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:20,080
Hey, Dick, is there somebody
you can call to make sure...

1432
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,120
the EPA's really doing
the investigation?

1433
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,520
- Of course. He oughta be in by now.
- Who?

1434
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,680
Skeeter Warburton, of course.
Always go straight to the top, son.

1435
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,040
Oh, a little outta
my league, Dick.

1436
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,200
Hey.

1437
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,960
Watch it.

1438
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,560
Let's go!

1439
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:52,000
[Hattie]
Congressman Dodge?

1440
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,960
Oh, uh, uh, Mrs. Rifkin
from the, uh...

1441
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,320
Silver Foxes. You remember,

1442
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,400
America's second-largest
seniors' organization...

1443
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:04,000
with members in every district
in Florida, including yours.

1444
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,520
Oh, yes, of course. It's a marvelous
organization, just marvelous.

1445
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,960
- Well, it's always a pleasure to see...
- I need to talk to you.

1446
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,760
Yes, I'd like that very much,
but right now I'm in a rush
to get back to my office.

1447
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,440
- You call for an appointment.
We'll get together...
- This won't take a second.

1448
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,240
- Could I just walk ya to your office?
- Uh, well...

1449
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,400
- That'd be fine.
- Oh, good.

1450
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,560
If the FDA would just agree
to look at the new support hose,

1451
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,280
we'd feel like
we made some progress.

1452
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:54,200
Indeed, you know, Mrs. Rifkin, I'm
always so excited to hear your views,

1453
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,520
but really, dear,
I've got to run.

1454
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,640
So run,
who's keeping you?

1455
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,240
So don't be a stranger.
Keep in touch.

1456
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,360
[Elevator Bell Ringing]

1457
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,240
[Elevator Bell Ringing]

1458
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,000
[Coin Clanging]

1459
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,920
Kimberly, can you get me
Skeeter Warburton on the phone, please?

1460
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,880
Right away, Chairman Dodge.

1461
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:54,400
- Uh, sweep for radon?
- Radon? I'm sorry, l...

1462
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,360
I don't recall.

1463
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,800
Do you have a work order?

1464
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,520
Oh, no, uh,
Supervisor said, uh...

1465
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,040
Supervisor said ain't supposed
to be no paperwork on this...

1466
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,480
'cause something about
y'all killed some radon study.

1467
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,840
Well, we did delete
a few minor budget items.

1468
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,880
Hey, how's it gonna look
to the other people...

1469
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:14,640
if they find out I swept your office
for radon, didn't do everybody else's?

1470
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,680
- How that gonna look, Mr. Warburton?
- Point taken. Go right ahead.

1471
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,040
You better step outside. I gotta spray
some nasty shit. Look at that.

1472
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,800
Uh-huh.

1473
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,600
Ah, Brenda? I'm stepping out
for a few minutes.

1474
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:29,000
Yeah, Brenda, don't come in here, 'cause
you may get some of this shit on ya.

1475
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,640
[As Warburton]
Ah, Brenda, I've changed my mind.

1476
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,800
- I'm expecting a call from...
- Mr. Warburton,
Chairman Dodge is on line two.

1477
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,200
Oh, speak of the devil.
Put him through.

1478
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,560
Afternoon, Mr. Chairman.
Skeeter here.

1479
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,520
I need a straight answer
from you, Skeeter.

1480
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,480
Is the White House
on your back about power lines?

1481
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,680
- Are we off the record, Mr. Chairman?
- Of course.

1482
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,600
I had hoped to go up to Hyannis Port
this weekend to spend time with Tish...

1483
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,440
and do some sailing, but I don't think
I'm going to be able to because I'm...

1484
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:08,480
spending a lot of time
in the office writing testimony
to your committee on cancer clusters.

1485
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:13,440
Well, l, uh, appreciate
your candor, Skeeter.

1486
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,000
- Anything to be of help, Mr. Chairman.
- Bye.

1487
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:23,040
[As Warburton] Ah, take off for
the rest of the week, please, Brenda.

1488
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,480
[Dodge] I don't see
how I can help ya on this one.

1489
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,080
This is the EPA.
This is the president.

1490
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,080
- This is my lifeblood.
- Olaf, I see that. I see that.

1491
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,480
But in this town
you've gotta pick your fights.

1492
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:37,120
This could mean
six figures, Dick.

1493
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,680
High six figures.

1494
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:47,040
Seven figures?

1495
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,680
I suppose a million dollars
isn't too much to insure against
losin' five billion.

1496
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,440
- Now you're talkin'.
- But how can I funnel
this kind of money to you?

1497
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,880
If that's what you want,
we can find a loophole.
No one will see your fingerprints.

1498
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,960
- No one will know?
- No one will know.

1499
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,560
Olaf's just making a contribution
as a patriotic citizen.

1500
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,840
- And in return for that, he's getting...
- Good government!

1501
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,040
Exactly!
Little access, that's all.

1502
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:19,080
Yes, I'm callin' from Chairman Dodge's
office on the Hill.

1503
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:24,200
We wanted to be sure CNN was sending
a crew to the clean air hearings today.

1504
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,600
No, not the new
emission standards.

1505
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:30,480
We're breaking news.
This is the biggest thing
since the check bouncing scandal.

1506
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,680
This is Cynthia Leeson from
the White House press office.

1507
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,400
My boss just wanted me
to call you folks and let you know
we're going to be making...

1508
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:40,480
a very important announcement
today at the clean air hearings.

1509
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:44,880
No, I'm sorry, I can't
tell you that, but it's hot.

1510
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,800
If the New York Times wants to be
the only paper in town to miss out...

1511
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,720
on the biggest story of the year,
that's just up to y'all.

1512
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:55,120
Hurry up, get into your seats.
Come on, you guys.

1513
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,840
[Hattie] It's gonna be a great day.
Molly, next to Harry.

1514
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,760
- Let's sit here.
- What, in the back?

1515
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,680
- Just sit down, will you?
- All right.

1516
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:08,840
- How's everything?
- Great.

1517
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,360
You know what would be
a wonderful way for us to start?

1518
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:15,280
With me congratulating you
on what a wonderful job you've
been doing on the committee.

1519
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:18,800
And really show our appreciation
especially on behalf
of the minority community.

1520
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,960
Well, I appreciate that, son.
Thank you very much.

1521
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,360
I'm cutting out of here early.

1522
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,360
[Ira]
Don't wanna run into him?

1523
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,360
This is a mistake.
I never should have come.

1524
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,400
I'm surprised, well, delighted
by the media turnout today.

1525
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:35,080
- I had no idea that clean air
was such a good issue.
- Oh, yeah, isn't it somethin'?

1526
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:44,080
This meeting of the Power
and Industry Committee...

1527
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,200
to consider the reauthorization
of the clean air act is now in session.

1528
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,080
Today's first business is a panel
of national leaders...

1529
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,840
in the field of utilities,
but before I welcome them,

1530
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,640
the chair would like to yield to the
distinguished gentleman from Florida.

1531
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:03,000
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'd like to make a very personal
statement, Mr. Chairman.

1532
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:07,320
I would like to start off by saying
thank you from the bottom of my heart,

1533
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:11,560
thank you for your leadership
and for your vision.

1534
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,240
But most of all I'd like to
thank you for your courage.

1535
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,360
Especially for your courage.

1536
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:22,280
- My courage, huh?
- Yes, sir, your courage...

1537
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:27,240
in exposing the corruption
that eats away at this institution.

1538
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,760
Your courage in taking on
the special interests...

1539
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,760
and your courage in taking
a major new step.

1540
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,760
But l-I've done nothing new.

1541
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,080
Nothing at all.
What are you talking about?

1542
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,800
This is true! Because integrity
is nothing new to you, Mr. Chairman.

1543
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,360
Integrity is second nature
to this man.

1544
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:47,520
But still it's a rare public servant
who'll take on the PACs...

1545
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,720
and the lobbyists
and the fat cats...

1546
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,080
and side with the American family
who just want to live
in safe neighborhoods...

1547
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,360
and send their kids
off to safe schools.

1548
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,480
Well, I thank the gentleman,
but we really must move along.
If the gentleman would...

1549
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,160
Ladies and gentlemen,
yesterday,

1550
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,760
I had a meeting
with the chairman...

1551
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,080
in his office
with Mr. Olaf Andersen...

1552
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:11,520
of Gulf Coast Power,
and his lobbyist, Mr. Terry Corrigan.

1553
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:15,600
I thank the gentleman!
But we really must move along!

1554
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,520
The subject of this meeting...

1555
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,720
was the possible EPA
investigation on power lines...

1556
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,000
and the connection between them
and increased cancer risks.

1557
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,160
Gentleman's out of order.

1558
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,040
Now what makes
this meeting different...

1559
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:32,200
from most of the other meetings
that take place in Washington...

1560
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,880
was that the American people
were actually represented...

1561
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:39,040
in the form of this.

1562
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,840
Oh!

1563
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:50,320
At Chairman Dodge's suggestion,

1564
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,040
I videotaped the entire meeting!

1565
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:55,960
Huh?

1566
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,480
Don't ya love that?

1567
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,600
Isn't that somethin'? Dick Dodge!
Isn't he somethin' special?

1568
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,960
- Don't you love this man?
- [Gavel Pounding]

1569
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,640
- Gentleman is out of order.
- Dodge double-crossed us.

1570
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:10,160
- You're fired.
- Don't ya love this chairman?

1571
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:12,080
[Gavel Pounding]
Gentleman is out of order!

1572
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,520
See, he's brought dignity back to
the name Dick. No longer is it tricky.

1573
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,040
Come on, Dick is good!
Dick is good!

1574
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,360
- Turn off his microphone!
- Chairman Dodge!

1575
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:28,600
This is neither the time
nor the place for these matters.

1576
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:32,360
But you may rest assured
that the committee...

1577
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,600
will investigate them
thoroughly.

1578
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:39,400
Now, we're gonna take
a 15-minute recess.

1579
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,640
Dick, you crazy son of a bitch,
you know we planned this.

1580
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,560
[Crowd Murmuring]

1581
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,520
You stupid son of a bitch!
You taped our conversation?

1582
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,160
They are makin' 'em
kinda small nowadays.

You think you're gonna
hang me out to dry? Bullshit!

you go down, Dick Dodge!

$300,000 you squeezed outta me...

registration scam, huh?

What the hell was that?
Just water under the bridge.

1589
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,640
What about the $200,000
for your phony foundation?

1590
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,240
- Or the bundled checks
my executive put in your pocket?
- Okay, now.

- No, no, I trusted you, Dick.
I gave you my condo in Vail.

- I gave you my corporate jet
to fly all over the...
- All right...

dull-ass autobiography!

I put up scholarships
to send your kids through college.

1595
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:32,720
I even hired your goddamn color-blind
wife to redecorate my office.

- Olaf! Jesus! Sit down!
- What are you doin'?

- I'm tryin' to tell you, I didn't have
a goddamn thing to do with this!
- You shittin' me?

No, no, no, no!
Think! Think!

1599
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,440
I know you got me
by the short and curlies.

1600
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,480
What the hell would I have
to gain by sellin' you out?

1601

I had no idea that slime bag
was tapin' us.

1602

Excuse me. Dick?

Lighten up on the slime bag,
huh?

to call Skeeter Warburton.

an investigation on power lines.

- Wha...
- Ah! There's more.

1611
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,720
I want you to resign. You can
tell people it's for health reasons.

1612
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,880
Most of us will believe that 'cause
we've seen you in the steam room.

1613

Why the hell are you doin' this?

1614

I am doing this for Mickey Juba
and I'm doin' this for Celia Kirby

- Do we have a deal or not?
- Well, I guess that...

1618
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:43,480
depends entirely on what's
on that tape, doesn't it?

You know what's on this tape.
This is America's sleaziest home video.

Fuck that. Let's see what you
really got on that tape.

Why not? He never made
any specific charges.

So what do we do when
we go back in the hearing?

Leave that to me. You just walk
back in there lookin' dignified.

- Dignified.
- And you!

01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:35,840
You better be very, very quiet
in there, my friend.

the next 20 years in prison,

I would like to make
a comment on the...

01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,880
unfortunate incident
that we all just witnessed.

Now, this body...
Well, indeed our whole...

1658

system of government
is imperfect.

1659
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,360
It's imperfect because
it depends on people.

10,000 copies of your autobiography.
