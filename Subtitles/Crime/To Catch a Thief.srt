1
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,831
My jewels! I've been robbed!
Someone stole my jewels!

2
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,031
Help! Police!

3
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,598
My diamonds! They've gone! Help!

4
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,317
Monsieur Robie?

5
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,033
Lepic, Mercier. Monsieur Robie,
we represent the <i>Sûreté</i>.

6
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,028
We are making inquiries in reference
to some jewel robberies.

7
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,473
We believe you could provide us
with information that would be helpful.

8
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,390
Would you be good enough to
accompany us to our office in Nice?

9
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,908
May I put on something more formal?

10
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,231
- OK.
- You left in a hurry?

11
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,476
- They came for me.
- The police?

12
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,717
- Five of them.
- Naturally, you are innocent.

13
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,992
I haven't stolen jewellery
in 15 years.

14
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,555
- Honesty!
- It has a good feeling.

15
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,799
What do you think of my kitchen?
Works like a machine.

16
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,310
Like our little band
in the Underground during the War.

17
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,910
Cutting, slicing, just like the old days.

18
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,351
They think I'm responsible
for these robberies, don't they?

19
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,873
- They were in prison with you.
- We're the first to be suspected.

20
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,390
Since the War,
I have obliged them to be honest.

21
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,674
I did not want them to break
their paroles and return to prison.

22
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,872
If my parole is broken,
they'll throw away the key.

23
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,517
I came to tell them and you that
I had nothing to do with the robberies.

24
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,431
Perhaps I believe you, but your
comrades think you let them down.

25
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,758
I wouldn't put it past them
to be doing the robberies themselves.

26
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,871
Simple men without education?

27
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,389
- No, Robie.
- Monsieur Bertani?

28
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,718
Excuse me, business calls. Don't go.

29
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,756
<i>Bonjour,</i> Foussard.

30
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,393
Coincidence can be terrible.

31
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,037
These robberies all bear your mark
but you claim to be innocent.

32
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,356
I do more than claim. I insist!

33
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,268
I can't understand how this thief
can imitate me so perfectly.

34
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,110
It's someone who knew my technique,
maybe somebody in the police.

35
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,157
He picks perfect victims
and the right stones.

36
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,876
Goes up walls, over roofs, leaves
no clue and disappears in the night.

37
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,798
Just like John Robie.

38
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,754
- You don't believe me!
- You're as nervous as a cat.

39
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,635
If somebody caught this imitator,
we'd all be off the hook.

40
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,159
Surely.

41
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,638
The police are chasing the wrong man.
Someone's got to chase the right one.

42
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,628
- One day he'll make a mistake.
- There's only one answer.

43
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,832
I've got to catch
this imitator myself.

44
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,156
You couldn't do more than the police.

45
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,115
But I could, and I'm the only one who
could, because I can anticipate him,

46
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,030
figure out his next move and catch
him with his hand in the jewel case.

47
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,879
Nobody will believe what you say.

48
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,868
Who believes me now?
The biggest problem is time.

49
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,231
I've got to hit him
before he hears I'm after him.

50
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,228
I need better information, the kind
that takes months to dig out.

51
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,477
Like who has jewels to be stolen?

52
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,276
Yeah. Where they live, where they
keep the stones, how much they drink.

53
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,711
Whether they have dogs,
guns, servants, insurance.

54
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,196
For old times' sakes,
perhaps I can help you.

55
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,590
- What have you got?
- You made me remember something.

56
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,836
Two days ago, a man came here.

57
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,917
- I did not like him.
- Why not?

58
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,159
He called me to his table,
asked me about crime and criminals.

59
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,432
Me, a respectable restaurateur!

60
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,679
- Does he know about the robberies?
- He asks me questions.

61
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,034
I refuse to answer. Then he asks me
about the jewels my clients wear.

62
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,950
I say to myself, "You are something
to do with this new cat."

63
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,037
"Maybe you are the new cat."

64
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,708
Foussard's daughter will take you
by boat to the beach club in Cannes.

65
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,115
Wait for a phone call there.

66
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,792
- Mr Cat, let's go.
- Danielle, do me a favour.

67
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,470
- Don't call me a cat.
- I only do one favour a day.

68
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,913
- Will you do as your father asks?
- Did I brush your fur the wrong way?

69
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,072
- You're getting us wet.
- It must be true.

70
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,239
- Cats don't like water.
- Don't mention that word again.

71
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,195
- A man should never regret his past.
- I only regret one thing.

72
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,914
That you never asked me to
marry you?

73
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,793
No, that I ever taught you English.

74
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,788
You only taught me the nouns.
I learned the adjectives myself.

75
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,037
- The word cat is a noun.
- Not the way you use it.

76
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,358
For you it means excitement,
danger, affluence.

77
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,997
What do you think of that word,
"affluence"? It means wealth.

78
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,635
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.

79
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,118
I was thinking about you. Imagining
you in your expensive villa.

80
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,598
Enjoying life, while we work
like idiots for a loaf of bread.

81
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,314
I work too,
raising grapes and flowers.

82
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,353
And rubies and diamonds and pearls.

83
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,638
School's open again.

84
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,118
Professor Robie will conduct a class
on how to get spanked in a hurry.

85
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,075
You can't touch me. I've graduated.
Are you going to South America?

86
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,794
No, just the beach club at Cannes.

87
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,992
I've always dreamed
of going to South America.

88
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,998
People say it's a virgin country.

89
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,033
I can cook, sew,

90
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,518
keep my mouth shut and peddle
stolen jewels on the black market.

91
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,798
You don't think I'm responsible
for all those recent robberies?

92
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,399
I think so.

93
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,070
Yes, together with your father
and my Resistance pals.

94
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,717
There's one great difference.
They are furious with you. I am not.

95
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,357
Listen carefully. I stole once,
a long time ago. I went to jail.

96
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,156
I know. You escaped, joined
the Underground and became heroes.

97
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,592
I wanted to make up for the things
I'd done. I've never stolen since.

98
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,396
I know what you've got.
Pardons that are not worth anything.

99
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,037
They were paroles, and we fought
for six years to earn them,

100
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,117
those of us who were still around.

101
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,834
Those paroles don't have much value.

102
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,032
They haven't been withdrawn
from circulation.

103
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,268
- No South America?
- No, just the beach club at Cannes.

104
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,040
Well, in that case we should hurry.

105
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,710
That airplane probably
belongs to the police.

106
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,078
- What's he doing now?
- He's coming back over us.

107
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,478
- Good. Well, wave to him.
- Suppose he's not my type.

108
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,229
Wave anyway, as if you're
a pretty girl out for a ride.

109
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,953
Well...

110
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,353
Not that pretty!
We want to get rid of him.

111
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,870
- How much further to the club?
- About 15 minutes.

112
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,039
When you get there, pull inshore
and mingle with the other boats.

113
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,798
- And then?
- I'm getting out.

114
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,596
- I'll leave my clothes with you.
- But you hoped to be inconspicuous!

115
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,473
Nobody will recognise me in these.

116
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,794
- Hello?
- The man I speak with you about.

117
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,719
The man who ask about the jewels.

118
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,798
He will wait for you
at the flower market in Nice.

119
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,915
He will find you. I told him you
would be tossing a coin in the air.

120
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,198
Tails?

121
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,195
HH Hughson, Lloyd's of London.

122
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,155
Are you the man who knows who owns
the best jewellery in this vicinity?

123
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,354
- We insure the important pieces.
- Insurance? That's gambling.

124
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,437
Shall we say betting?

125
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,791
Yes, let's say betting.
I have a long shot for you.

126
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,673
A little help in return
for some of your losses.

127
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,509
- So Mr Bertani told me.
- Are you interested?

128
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,998
The proposition sounds intriguing,
albeit a little unorthodox.

129
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,077
Does that mean yes or no?

130
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,157
- My dear Mr Robie...
- Smith.

131
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,555
I beg your pardon. Ever been married?

132
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,038
- No. What has that to do with it?
- It might help you to understand.

133
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,869
I have two wives,
Felicity and the London office.

134
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,957
I must return worthy of both.

135
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,278
I see. They wouldn't approve
of your giving me a list of clients?

136
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,632
Officially, you come under
the category of extremely bad risk.

137
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,074
I'll see you later.

138
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,513
It's a pleasure to meet an insurance
agent who enjoys paying off claims.

139
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,148
- Unofficially, there's hope for you.
- I was sure there would be.

140
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,115
- We're both taking a big chance.
- What happens to you if I'm caught?

141
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,916
- I might be embarrassed or censured.
- They could put me away for good!

142
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,997
You made a bad choice of profession.

143
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,510
Let's come to an understanding.
I'm doing you a favour.

144
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,553
I take the risks,
you get the jewellery back.

145
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,276
Mr Smith, it strikes me that only
an honest man would be so foolish.

146
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,155
- How much do you need?
- Half a dozen names.

147
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,759
Anything else?

148
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,839
Addresses, habits, descriptions
of the stones and settings.

149
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,396
Suppose it gets into the wrong hands?

150
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,559
It already has, unless you're
the thief. Where are you staying?

151
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,159
Carlton, Cannes.

152
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,872
No, my dear fellow,
not in the middle of the day.

153
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,235
Bring it to the table with you.

154
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,719
Come along.

155
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,148
Under the circumstances,
do you think it pays to advertise?

156
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,193
He hasn't left the villa in years.

157
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,953
- How do you like the place?
- Immensely.

158
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,393
It's a kind of heaven, where a man
dreams he'll go when he retires.

159
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,399
About that list of clients
who have jewellery worth stealing.

160
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,515
- Why don't we enjoy our lunch first?
- I don't want to seem impatient.

161
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,430
But I have to come up with something
convincing for the magistrate.

162
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,835
It's a nice custom they have here.

163
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,271
Provisional liberty
based on insufficient evidence.

164
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,357
That may not last long for me.

165
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,634
- You were in the Underground Army.
- I was in the Resistance.

166
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,308
- Did you kill many people?
- 72.

167
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,711
I know what would have pleased you.
Not one of them was insured.

168
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,390
You're a man of obvious good taste
in everything.

169
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,388
- How did you... Why did you...?
- Why did I take up stealing?

170
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,795
To live better, to own things,

171
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,755
to acquire this good taste you enjoy
and which I'm reluctant to give up.

172
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,430
- You were frankly dishonest?
- I tried to be.

173
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,791
I thought you'd have
some tale of hardship,

174
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,788
your mother ran off when
you were young, your father beat you.

175
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,710
No. I was in an American trapeze act
in a circus that travelled in Europe.

176
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,708
It folded, so I put my agility
to a more rewarding purpose.

177
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,797
You have no other defence?

178
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,118
I only stole from people
who wouldn't go hungry. Your plate.

179
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,188
- Quiche Lorraine, you'll enjoy this.
- I've heard of it.

180
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,233
- It looks delicious.
- Yes.

181
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,396
It's wonderful.
The pastry is as light as air.

182
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,229
Germaine has sensitive hands,
an exceedingly light touch.

183
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,839
I can tell.

184
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,670
She strangled a German general once,
without a sound.

185
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,511
Extraordinary woman.

186
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,508
I take it you were
a sort of modern Robin Hood.

187
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,030
You gave away most of the proceeds
of your crime.

188
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,031
Kept everything myself. Let's face it,
I was an out-and-out thief.

189
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,754
- Like you.
- I say, steady on.

190
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,748
Wait. Did you ever take an ashtray
from a hotel, or a towel?

191
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,155
Souvenirs, they expect that.

192
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,909
You're given an expense allowance
for your meals, right?

193
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,431
This meal is free. Are you going to
deduct it from your expense account?

194
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,916
- No, it would be stupid. You agree?
- Yes.

195
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,112
You're a thief.
Only an amateur, of course.

196
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,630
But it will help you sympathise
with us professionals.

197
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,434
- I don't understand.
- Look at it this way.

198
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,349
- You're sorry you took the ashtray?
- Right now, yes.

199
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,836
You'll be sorry you didn't deduct
this lunch from your account.

200
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,431
I can't deduct every little item.
I couldn't spare the time!

201
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,676
Some day, you'll wish you had.

202
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,952
If an ashtray is missing,
they don't come for you.

203
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,358
Let a diamond bracelet disappear
and they shout, "Robie, The Cat!"

204
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,474
You don't have to spend every day
proving your honesty. I do.

205
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,159
Let's get down to business. The list.

206
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,836
- Is something bothering you?
- I told the police.

207
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,032
- I didn't expect them to like it.
- They thought it a splendid idea.

208
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,391
They hope you'll provide
the evidence against you.

209
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,512
Ah, yes.
It had to be something like that.

210
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,479
- Suppose it all goes wrong?
- You're wasting time.

211
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,910
Quite a thorough job.
Have some wine, Hughson.

212
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,915
Yes, I think I will.

213
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,989
I wish I'd known someone in insurance
when I started in the burglary business.

214
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,039
Let me see, my first bait
will be this Mrs Stevens,

215
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,391
the American with the diamonds
and the daughter.

216
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,355
I'm having dinner with them tomorrow.
I could possibly arrange a meeting.

217
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,793
In this business you can't do things
the honest way. Remember that.

218
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,351
Wouldn't it be better if you left
that jewellery in the hotel safe?

219
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,997
I didn't buy these things for
my old age. I bought them to wear.

220
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,033
Put your money away. You can cheat
a little on your expense account.

221
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,359
That's France.

222
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,917
Everyone gets a tip, whether
he's earned it or not. It's the law.

223
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,112
Everywhere you go,
you complain about tipping.

224
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,869
And I shall continue to complain.
I've just paid for the privilege.

225
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,590
Let's go to the casino.
I want to hit the tables.

226
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,033
Perhaps I should just mail them the
money. No, Pierre, I can't afford it.

227
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,391
Handsome! I wouldn't mind
buying that for you.

228
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,477
- Mother!
- Come along.

229
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,117
- Mr Hughson may not like gambling.
- Everyone likes to gamble, even you.

230
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,356
I have an intense dislike for it.

231
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,393
When the stakes are right,
you'll gamble.

232
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,677
This is imitation? Really?
You mean, costume jewellery?

233
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,113
The things they make! You can hardly
tell it from the real thing.

234
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,675
Better than anything in Oregon.

235
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,713
- Almost everything is!
- Thank you.

236
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,633
Baccarat's my game. Why did you let
me close to this whirling pickpocket?

237
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,118
Ah, wouldn't you know?

238
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,998
I'm terribly sorry, madam.

239
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,315
But, madam, that was
a 10,000 franc plaque.

240
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,275
Maybe she... Madam, if you'd rather
not take my word, it's all right.

241
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,670
Thank you. I'll trust you too.
I won't count it.

242
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,035
If Jeremiah were only here!

243
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,028
This flying around from Palm Springs
to St Moritz to the Riviera,

244
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,117
he'd think it was foolishness.

245
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,630
He used to say, "I wouldn't be
a society gadabout"

246
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,991
"if they promised me
I could live forever."

247
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,876
He got his wish! Mr Burns,
where did you say you were from?

248
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,231
- Oregon.
- Jeremiah would have liked you.

249
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,228
A man with both feet on the ground,
that's what he was.

250
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,399
He never realised the value
of the ground he had his feet on.

251
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,795
- We had a ranch...
- Mother, please.

252
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,073
Mr Burns would be interested.
We had a ranch, not a very big one.

253
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,953
No plumbing. A little thing out back.

254
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,438
Jeremiah will never know how close
he came to 20 million barrels of oil.

255
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,035
Bourbon's the only drink. You can
pour that champagne down the Channel.

256
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,073
Why wait 80 years to drink the stuff?

257
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,909
Great vineyards,
huge barrels ageing forever,

258
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,270
poor monks running around testing it,

259
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,790
so some woman in Oklahoma
can say it tickles her nose!

260
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,673
Mother, we ought to go to bed.

261
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,712
Nobody ever calls me Jessie any more.

262
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,435
Mr Burns, would you call me Jessie?

263
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,313
- I'd be happy to.
- Good.

264
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,196
Mr Hughson, would you call me Jessie?

265
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,277
- If you like.
- I like.

266
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,631
- Mr Burns, you said lumber?
- That's right.

267
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,152
How come you haven't made a pass at
my daughter? Don't say, "Oh, Mother!"

268
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,148
- Mr Burns, I asked you a question.
- Very pretty.

269
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,874
Quietly attractive.

270
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,868
But too nice. Sorry I ever sent her
to that finishing school.

271
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,390
- They finished her there!
- Come on, Mother.

272
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,388
And so to bed, where I can cuddle up
to my jewellery.

273
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,388
You know, Mr Hughson,
as rare and wonderful as they are,

274
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,955
I'd rather have 100,000 Jeremiahs.

275
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,948
- I'll toddle along to my cot.
- I'll escort you to your suite.

276
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,837
- Very thoughtful. Come on, Jessie.
- Do you make much money at lumber?

277
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,713
Right now, building is booming.

278
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,912
Would you mind
if I had you investigated?

279
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,475
Not at all. With what object?

280
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,468
If I were Francie's age,
you'd sound too good to be true.

281
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,153
Thank you. You know, there's
very little lumber around here.

282
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,715
Why did you come to the Riviera?

283
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,434
To meet someone as charming as you.

284
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,428
Boy, now I am going to have you
investigated!

285
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,110
- Aren't you going in?
- I'm down the other end.

286
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,030
How much did he get away with?

287
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,630
The gems were insured
for 35,000 in dollars.

288
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,717
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

289
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,357
I sympathise. Pretty rough having to
send bad news back to your office.

290
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,393
I insured Madame Leroux personally.

291
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,878
At least you know that the burglar...
What do they call him?

292
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,718
- The Cat.
- Yes.

293
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,875
He's still around and getting closer
all the time. That's something.

294
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,358
Mrs Stevens, would you keep
your jewellery in the hotel safe?

295
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,519
- Do I wear the safe round my neck?
- Not literally.

296
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,190
Your insurance company goes into
shock every time something's stolen.

297
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,188
If you haven't any guts,
you shouldn't have taken my bet.

298
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,188
- Do you wanna welch?
- If they're stolen, you'll be paid.

299
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,473
But we couldn't replace the affection
you have for those pieces.

300
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,672
I have no more affection
for that jewellery

301
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,599
than I have for a train ticket.

302
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,828
They're pretty and make it possible
for my daughter to go to places

303
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,157
and not be ashamed of me,
that is, too ashamed of me.

304
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,509
- Good morning, Mr Hughson.
- Good morning.

305
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,597
- Mr Burns.
- You sent for me.

306
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,873
I thought we might go for a swim or,
if you're not athletic, sunbathing.

307
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,117
I think I can manage to stay afloat.

308
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,437
Mr Hughson's been telling us
about a robbery.

309
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,914
Who?

310
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,238
Madame Leroux, wife of
a high government official. $35,000.

311
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,910
Too bad. You should find
a more happy business.

312
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,317
The famous jewel thief, The Cat,
is loose again.

313
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,476
Mother, you're next.

314
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,557
I'm insured.

315
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,197
- I'll get my bathing trunks.
- I'll be down in a few minutes.

316
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,472
- Good hunting, Hughson.
- Just a minute.

317
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,468
- Weren't we going to...?
- Weren't we going to what?

318
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,831
- Last night we discussed going up.
- Up?

319
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,716
- Up the funicular railway.
- I can't even spell funicular!

320
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,315
What are you doing this afternoon?

321
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,671
A real estate agent
gave me a list of villas for rent.

322
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,110
Do you plan that long a vacation?

323
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,834
I might even retire here.

324
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,433
Some of the villas aren't in good
repair. The roofs need examination.

325
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,833
Don't let the robbery spoil your day.
It's only money, and not even yours!

326
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,351
Shall I ask the social director
to introduce us?

327
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,711
No, I was wondering
which was the best way out.

328
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,357
- The Mediterranean's this way.
- I'm a gambler. Let's try that.

329
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,517
There's a message for you.

330
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,919
Thank you.

331
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,150
You performed a beautiful robbery
last night.

332
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,839
Strictly routine.

333
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,751
You steal a small fortune and then lie
on the beach with an American beauty.

334
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,474
That's why one needs a small fortune.

335
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,878
- Is this your next victim?
- She's a useful friend.

336
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,875
Your old friends of the Resistance
who work at the restaurant,

337
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,676
they called the police terrible names
when they let you go yesterday.

338
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,668
Would it be bad manners to ask
who tipped off the police?

339
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,599
They never say anything to the <i>flics.</i>

340
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,199
Somebody did.

341
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,188
But they would be happy if you were
caught during your next job.

342
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,755
It's nice to know I have friends.

343
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,509
- Perhaps it would be better.
- Any particular reason?

344
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,317
I heard talk in the kitchen: What
a pity if they must kill The Cat.

345
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,750
They will do all they can to avoid prison.

346
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,033
The police want me in jail.
My old friends want me dead.

347
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,596
- The Cat wants me out of town.
- What do you mean?

348
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,236
He sent me a message.
The sky is about to fall in on me.

349
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,878
It's foolish to remain here without
knowing what may happen to you.

350
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,557
If you were in South America with me,
you would know what will happen.

351
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,876
You make it sound dangerous.

352
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,755
It would be so much nicer
to be killed by love, no?

353
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,951
I'll get the water out of my ear.

354
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,312
John, you know what sort of men
they are at Bertani's.

355
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,034
They will do something to you.

356
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,038
Yes. I better get back.

357
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,670
What has she got more than me,
except money?

358
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,713
And you are getting plenty of that.

359
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,549
Danielle, you are just a girl.
She is a woman.

360
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,275
Why do you want to buy an old car
if you can get a new one cheaper?

361
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,948
It will run better and last longer.

362
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,356
My old car just drove off.

363
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,556
No, it's turned amphibious. I thought
I'd see what the big attraction was.

364
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,833
- And rate an introduction.
- You didn't tell me your name.

365
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,350
- Danielle Foussard.
- Miss Stevens.

366
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,917
How do you do? Mr Burns has told me
so little about you.

367
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,238
- We met a couple of minutes ago.
- That's right, a few minutes.

368
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,228
Only a few minutes ago?
And you talk like old friends!

369
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,159
That's warm, friendly France for you!

370
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,229
I was asking about renting some water
skis. Would you like me to teach you?

371
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,910
Thank you, but I was
women's champion last season.

372
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,035
- It was just an idea.
- Were you talking about water skis?

373
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,392
It looked as though you were
conjugating irregular verbs.

374
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,238
- Say something nice, Danielle.
- She looks a lot older up close.

375
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,789
To a mere child,
anything over 20 might seem old.

376
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,994
A child? Shall we stand
in shallower water and discuss that?

377
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,598
- Enjoying yourself?
- It's very nice, the sun and all.

378
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,110
It's too much for me.
I'll see you at the hotel.

379
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:29,235
Finish telling me why French women
are more seductive than Americans.

380
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,954
You know what I'd like to tell you!

381
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,713
Here.

382
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,677
Do you have time for me now?

383
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,998
- I'm sorry I was so long out there.
- I thought you'd be a lot longer.

384
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,909
Well, what about cocktails?
Six o'clock suit you?

385
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,315
We can talk about that on the way.

386
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,715
- To where?
- To rent you a villa.

387
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,874
- Picking a villa is personal.
- I have my car.

388
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,719
And lunch with chicken and beer.

389
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,230
It's too much to expect.
A tiring, dusty trip...

390
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,399
You're bound to get lost. A stranger
who doesn't know the language.

391
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,751
I was going to hire
an English-speaking chauffeur.

392
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,837
I'll give you a wholesale rate.

393
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,919
- And no tipping.
- Your terms are generous.

394
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,392
- Too generous to refuse.
- My terms usually are.

395
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,955
- Where's your car?
- Right there.

396
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,948
I can't seem to get out of this
gracefully, so let's go.

397
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,031
I've been waiting for you to mention
that kiss I gave you last night.

398
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,710
Back home in Oregon,
we'd call you a headstrong girl.

399
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,198
- Where in Oregon? The Rogue River?
- Where were you born?

400
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,517
In a taxi, halfway between home
and the hospital.

401
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,597
I've lived in 27 different towns.

402
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,314
- Is somebody chasing you?
- Boys.

403
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,590
You can stop running now.

404
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,351
When my father died, they discovered
oil on our land. I started to travel.

405
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,711
- The boys' fathers were chasing you?
- Yes.

406
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,230
I had a funny feeling
they wanted my money.

407
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,317
I'm impressed.

408
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,798
Back in Oregon, we'd have called you
a rich, headstrong girl.

409
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,037
- Money handles most people.
- You believe that?

410
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,312
- I've proved it.
- You're a singular girl.

411
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,909
- Is that good or bad?
- Good.

412
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,908
You know what you want,
you go after it. Nothing stops you.

413
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,997
You make it sound corny.

414
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,078
You're a jackpot
of admirable character traits.

415
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,952
I knew that.

416
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,470
You do things with dispatch.
No wasted preliminaries.

417
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,798
Not only did I enjoy that kiss,
I was awed by the efficiency behind it.

418
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,355
I believe in getting down to essentials.

419
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,269
Inviting me for breakfast,
planning a swim and now this drive.

420
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,552
Miss Stevens,
you are a girl in a million.

421
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,150
That's a routine compliment,
but I'll accept it.

422
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,148
- May I ask a personal question?
- I've been hoping you would.

423
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,670
What do you expect to get
out of being nice to me?

424
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,350
- More than you're willing to offer.
- I know.

425
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,395
You're in Europe to buy a husband.

426
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,229
- The man I want doesn't have a price.
- That eliminates me.

427
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,670
You're right. Give me a woman
who knows her own mind.

428
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,077
No one gives you a woman like that.
You have to capture her.

429
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,396
- Any particular method?
- Yes.

430
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,910
But it's no good unless
you discover it yourself.

431
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,790
- Are you sure this is the address?
- It's on the estate agent's list.

432
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,353
Let me see.

433
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,235
Let's look at the gardens.
No need to bother the people.

434
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,838
Why don't you own a place like this?

435
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,238
Palaces are for royalty. We're just
common people with a bank account.

436
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,556
That sounds like your mother, not you.

437
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,070
We're not that different.
A few years and some grammar.

438
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,635
And jewellery. You never wear any.

439
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,115
I don't like cold things on my skin.

440
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,836
- Why not invent some hot diamonds?
- I prefer more tangible excitement.

441
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,034
- What do you get a thrill out of most?
- I'm still looking for that one.

442
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,191
We were going to look at the gardens.

443
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,793
I was interested in the architecture.
Turn of the century, isn't it?

444
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,837
You never mention your wife.

445
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,828
- I never found time to get married.
- You don't seem pushed for time.

446
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,032
Did you come over to add items
to your diary,

447
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,550
like the name of that French girl
you swam out to meet?

448
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,878
- You are husband-hunting after all.
- That wasn't jealousy you heard.

449
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,835
Merely disappointment in your limited
imagination. Teenage French girls!

450
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,795
I bet you snowed her under, the
handsome lumber man from America.

451
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,992
I'll bet you told her
all your trees were sequoias.

452
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,478
That sounds like jealousy to me.
Don't be ashamed of it. Let it out.

453
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,389
- You're somewhat egotistical.
- Fighting fire with fire.

454
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,751
- Miss Stevens?
- Yes, Mr Burns?

455
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,871
- You know what I think?
- About what?

456
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,958
- You.
- I don't really care.

457
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,037
Tell me.

458
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,358
You're an insecure, pampered woman,
accustomed to attracting men.

459
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,348
You're not sure whether they're
attracted to you or your money.

460
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,874
- You may never know.
- Anything else?

461
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,868
You need something I haven't the time
or inclination to give you.

462
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,911
And what is that?

463
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,476
Two weeks with a good man
at Niagara Falls.

464
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,794
I'm hungry. What about that picnic?

465
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,833
Not till we get to
the picnic grounds.

466
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,510
- Which you've picked out.
- Which I've picked out.

467
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,234
- Is it far?
- A few miles.

468
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,079
- Lonely and secluded?
- Naturally.

469
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,193
Then why are we dawdling like this?

470
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,870
That's exactly what
was running through my mind.

471
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,952
- Slow down.
- And let them catch us?

472
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,789
- Let who catch us?
- The police who were following you.

473
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,355
Police following me?

474
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,997
Yes, police following you,
John Robie, The Cat.

475
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,633
Lovely day! Have you ever seen
any place more beautiful?

476
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,991
Just look at the colours
of the sea and the sky,

477
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,236
and the pink and green buildings.

478
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,149
Think of all those roofs
you could climb over.

479
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,874
- Who did you call me?
- John Robie.

480
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:38,835
The jewel thief known as The Cat.
I read about you in the Paris paper.

481
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,076
You may have read about The Cat...

482
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,876
I thought you said you were hungry.
The picnic basket's in the trunk.

483
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,918
Try to bluff me, and I can have the
fun of telling you how clever I was.

484
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,554
Since I'm not Mr Robie but Mr Burns,

485
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,276
there would be hardly any point,
but tell me how clever you were.

486
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,917
- The first thing I noticed...
- Don't sound so pleased!

487
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,238
I never caught a jewel thief before.
It's stimulating. It's like...

488
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,476
Like sitting in a hot tub?

489
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,238
Let me serve. First time I saw you
was on the beach at Cannes.

490
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,228
You swam ashore from a motor boat
driven by that French girl.

491
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,149
- You got an opener? Thank you.
- Do you want a leg or a breast?

492
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,237
You make the choice.

493
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,228
That was two days before
you showed up as Mr Conrad Burns,

494
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,237
just over from America.

495
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,715
- Did you swim?
- Naturally.

496
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,071
Don't be disappointing
and sound like Mr Burns.

497
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,558
- I can only be myself, Miss Stevens.
- Then be yourself, John.

498
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,911
- I prefer Conrad.
- You can't be serious.

499
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,669
It's time you called me Francie.

500
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,519
They've tried to steal Mother's
jewellery before.

501
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:04,714
When I read about the... you in the
paper, a small item, but I picked it up,

502
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,070
I was sure Mother would catch your eye.

503
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,191
She did, because I liked her.

504
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,073
- So far, Miss Stevens...
- Francie.

505
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,750
- You haven't said anything clever.
- Stick around.

506
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,111
The next thing I noticed
was something remarkable.

507
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,995
All evening, you looked at my mother,
not at me.

508
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,431
- I kissed you, didn't I?
- I kissed you.

509
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,279
- I wasn't looking at her then.
- You were thinking about her.

510
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,359
- You let me say goodnight so easily.
- I'm a gentleman.

511
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,950
A rough lumber man
from the Northwest?

512
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,232
I must remember to yell
"Timber!" occasionally.

513
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:46,793
Here comes the clever part.
You're just not convincing, John.

514
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,151
You're like an American
in an English movie.

515
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,352
You don't talk like
an American tourist.

516
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,711
The guidebooks say,
"Don't behave like a tourist."

517
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,230
You never mention business
or baseball or television

518
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,954
or wage freezes or Senate probes.

519
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,674
The things I left America to forget.

520
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,350
You're not American enough
to carry it off.

521
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,348
- Tell me, how long has it been?
- How long has what been?

522
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,870
- Since you were in America.
- Four or five days.

523
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,594
- And Oregon?
- Two days before that.

524
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,509
Name three deciduous trees
indigenous to the Northwest.

525
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,190
You're a very nice girl
with too much imagination.

526
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,188
Talk like that and I'll go to jail
for something I didn't do.

527
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,436
Will you rob Mother or somebody else?

528
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,758
- Somebody else!
- That's nice. Mother likes you.

529
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,919
Lady Kenton should be our next job.
Isn't she on your list?

530
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,238
She ought to be. The Kenton jewels
are famous. I know her villa.

531
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,716
- I can hear your next line.
- The Cat has a new kitten.

532
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,753
- When do we start?
- Don't talk like that.

533
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,953
- You're leaving fingerprints on me.
- I am not The Cat.

534
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,630
Why are the police following you?
Show me that list.

535
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:05,675
That villa isn't for rent. The Sanfords
own it. I'm going to a party there.

536
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,388
You've a very strong grip.
The kind a burglar needs.

537
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,594
That's why you came up here.

538
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,868
We'll have cocktails at 8.00
and dinner at 8.30 in my suite.

539
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,752
We'll talk about it there.

540
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,714
I can't come. I'm going to the casino
and a firework display.

541
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,673
There's a better view from my place.

542
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,916
Already got another date.

543
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:45,079
Everywhere you go, I'll have
you paged as John Robie, The Cat.

544
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,754
8.00 and be on time.

545
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,748
- I haven't got a decent watch.
- Steal one.

546
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,114
I could not speak with you today, Mr
Robie. I did not know your new name.

547
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,835
What were you doing
at the Sanford villa?

548
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,874
I supply food for the grand gala.
I was inspecting the kitchen.

549
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,313
<i>I do not ask you what you were</i>
<i>doing there. You prepare also, no?</i>

550
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,910
<i>There will be many women,</i>
<i>rich jewels.</i>

551
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,669
- Just the bait I need.
- Something The Cat can't resist?

552
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,190
- I suppose your boys will be there.
- <i>Naturally.</i>

553
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,834
They threatened to put me away.

554
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,828
They'd be much too busy
to do anything like that.

555
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,032
- You keep them busy.
- <i>Goodbye, Robie.</i>

556
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,754
Who was the pretty American girl?

557
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,793
<i>You bring her to my restaurant</i>
<i>for dinner?</i>

558
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,470
- Not tonight. She made plans for us.
- Soon.

559
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,555
If you want to see the fireworks,
it's better with the lights out.

560
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,038
You're going to see one of the
Riviera's most fascinating sights.

561
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,028
- I was talking about the fireworks.
- I never doubted it.

562
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,710
The way you looked at my necklace,
I didn't know.

563
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,230
You've been dying
to say something about it.

564
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,479
- Have I been staring at it?
- You've been trying to avoid it.

565
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,875
May I have a brandy? Care for one?

566
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:28,679
No, thank you. Some nights
a person doesn't need to drink.

567
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:37,558
Aren't you nervous to be in a room
with diamonds, unable to touch them?

568
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,637
No.

569
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,230
Like an alcoholic outside a bar
on election day.

570
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,153
- Wouldn't know the feeling.
- All right.

571
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:51,319
You've studied the layout,
worked out your timetable,

572
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,913
put on dark clothes with crêpe-soled
shoes and a rope, face blackened.

573
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:03,311
Over the roofs, down to the right
apartment... and the window's locked.

574
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,832
All that elation turned into frustration.
What would you do?

575
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,031
I'd go home, get some sleep.

576
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:15,431
What would you do? The thrill is
in front of you, but you can't get it.

577
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:19,110
The gems glistening
on the other side of the window.

578
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:23,950
- Someone asleep, breathing heavily.
- I'd go home, get some sleep.

579
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,878
Wouldn't you use a glass cutter,
your fist, to get what you wanted,

580
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,753
knowing it was there waiting for you?

581
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,430
- Forget it.
- Drinking dulls your senses.

582
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,473
And if I'm lucky, some of my hearing.

583
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,798
Blue-white with hairlike touches
of platinum.

584
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,039
I have the same interest in jewellery
as in politics, modern poetry,

585
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,073
or women who need
weird excitement: None.

586
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,308
Hold this necklace in your hand
and tell me you're not Robie The Cat.

587
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:01,033
John, you're going to rob that villa
we cased this afternoon, aren't you?

588
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,677
I suppose "rob" is archaic.
You'd say "knock over"?

589
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,757
Don't worry. I'm good at secrets.

590
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,669
- Have you been to a psychiatrist?
- Don't change the subject.

591
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:16,078
I know the perfect time. Next week
is the Sanfords' annual gala.

592
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:20,068
Everyone who counts will be there.
I'll get you an invitation.

593
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,157
It's an 18th-century costume affair.

594
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,955
There'll be thousands of dollars'
worth of jewellery.

595
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,711
Some guests stay for the weekend.
We'll do it together. What do you say?

596
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,199
My comment would be censorable.

597
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,235
Give up, John. Admit who you are.

598
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,714
I can tell where you're looking.

599
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,677
Look, John. Hold them.

600
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:07,714
Diamonds, the only thing in the world
you can't resist.

601
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,152
Then tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

602
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,913
Ever had a better offer in
your whole life? One with everything?

603
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,629
- I've never had a crazier one.
- Just as long as you're satisfied.

604
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,797
You know as well as I do
this necklace is imitation.

605
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,877
Well, I'm not.

606
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:26,038
- Give them back to me.
- What did you have in mind?

607
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,515
Give them back. Mother's jewels.

608
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,197
I don't have them.

609
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,431
Wait a minute.

610
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,834
- When did it happen?
- When I was asleep.

611
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,998
- Let's look.
- The place to look is here!

612
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,156
Help yourself.

613
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,518
Did Francie tell you what happened?

614
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,154
Yes, she's searching my room.

615
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:03,319
- She knew where my jewellery was.
- May I look in your room?

616
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:08,036
If it'll do any good. We ought to
call the police and the manager.

617
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,117
Would you let me look first?

618
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,312
I'd be happy
if you didn't find anything.

619
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,397
Why do you say that?

620
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,355
I'm tired of draping them over me.
It's exciting to have them stolen.

621
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,552
You can't lose, as long as
Hughson makes out the cheque.

622
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,548
I'd be crazy to take this attitude
if I did.

623
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,675
Why did Francie suspect you, Mr Burns?
A woodcutter from Oregon!

624
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,158
I'm anything but that, Mrs Stevens.
My real name is John Robie.

625
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,193
I used to be a jewel thief years ago.

626
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:45,952
- What a wonderful surprise!
- I can't get worked up over it.

627
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,755
- Where did you keep the stuff?
- In the case.

628
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,668
- Watch out for fingerprints.
- There won't be any.

629
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,515
- Did they get everything?
- Everything.

630
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,035
Francie must have known about you.

631
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,437
She guessed today.
You must sleep soundly.

632
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,517
I do.

633
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,430
He came down through the air shaft.

634
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,235
If you're not Mr Burns, why do you
call yourself that and not...

635
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,638
- What was the other name?
- John Robie. Mrs Stevens...

636
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,628
- The gang won't let you go straight?
- The gang is the law.

637
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,752
Mother, don't talk to him.

638
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,155
Don't touch anything to cover any clues.

639
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,433
There aren't any clues. He came down
the air shaft and went the same way.

640
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,996
- You know how he got in.
- Did you find anything in my room?

641
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,351
- I certainly did.
- Nothing of your mother's.

642
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,755
You gave those to your accomplice.

643
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,556
But the clothes of Mr Burns,
the American, all had French labels.

644
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,038
I found this: Everyone on the Riviera
with jewellery worth stealing.

645
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,435
Listen to what it says about us.

646
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,757
What good is that?
You're already caught.

647
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,397
I called the police and told them
who you are and what you did tonight.

648
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,355
Everything? The boys must have
enjoyed that down at headquarters.

649
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,757
He isn't Burns.
He's a jewel thief called The Cat.

650
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,478
What's he doing here now
if he's already got the junk?

651
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:23,754
- Returning to the scene of crime.
- Since when is love a crime?

652
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:28,397
Robie is a real man, not one of
those milksops you take up with.

653
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,433
- Mother, after all.
- After all, my foot.

654
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,077
Why do you think we moved so many
times? Your father was a swindler.

655
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,558
But a lovable one. This one's
a bigger operator on every level.

656
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,159
Thank you.

657
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:48,434
I've had to travel round after you
to keep men like this away from you.

658
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,030
It looks like the blockers
are having all the fun.

659
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,799
She doesn't have common sense, I do.

660
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,710
They're my baubles. If I don't care,
why should you? They're insured.

661
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,871
Now, where do we go from here?

662
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,637
To jail.

663
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,235
- Where is he?
- Who?

664
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,113
- John Robie.
- Never heard of him.

665
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,791
<i>Mother, the book you're reading</i>
<i>is upside down.</i>

666
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:51,519
We may be in France, but a man
is innocent till proved guilty.

667
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,597
- Proved!
- That won't be hard.

668
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,554
John Robie's the first man
who wouldn't roll over for you.

669
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,433
He played us both for fools.

670
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,950
You ought to be sent back
to public school.

671
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,948
- They could pound sense into you.
- He's a worthless thief.

672
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,789
- Just what did he steal from you?
- Mother!

673
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,788
Sit down while I tell you something
about life and John Robie.

674
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,195
Sit down before I knock you down.

675
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,710
For three days, you've been fishing?

676
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,959
Keep it down. Do you still believe
I did the Stevens job?

677
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,350
Yes, until you sent for me. You'd
hardly risk my bringing the police.

678
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,993
Thank you.

679
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,351
You've been in hiding.
Why did you come out?

680
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,552
- I need your help.
- I need yours more.

681
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,637
My superiors at the London office...

682
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,310
I might solve some of your problems,
possibly all.

683
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,308
- That's too much to hope for.
- I've been watching a villa.

684
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,034
- Which one?
- The South American couple.

685
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:17,473
Somebody else is watching it too, but
I haven't managed to find out who.

686
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,557
- Has he seen you?
- Probably.

687
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:24,197
I want to set a foolproof trap.
I need the assistance of the police.

688
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,277
I can't approach them.

689
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:31,554
- How do you know he'll be there?
- Somebody gave this to Germaine.

690
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,396
It's in French. What does it say?

691
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,355
"Stay away from the Silvas' villa.
It's my night to yell, not yours."

692
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,348
- Who gave it to Germaine?
- It was in her shopping basket.

693
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:49,714
Look, convince Lepic to have police
at the villa soon after midnight.

694
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,597
- You're going there?
- Of course.

695
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,237
That note is bait for a trap. Someone
wants you to go to the Silvas'.

696
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,273
- I know it.
- Possibly to kill you.

697
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,313
- Will you talk to Lepic?
- All right.

698
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,034
But if this Cat doesn't show up,

699
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:10,358
the police might get you and
the thing will turn out rather badly.

700
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,074
I'd better go along as your alibi.

701
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,239
I know you get insurance
at a discount but why be foolhardy?

702
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,830
Everyone in Philadelphia
reads "The Bulletin".

703
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,598
Just a minute.

704
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:31,359
- What's all the excitement?
- The cat burglar's dead.

705
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,118
John Robie?

706
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:37,438
No, a man named Foussard.
A wine steward in a restaurant.

707
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:41,428
You better start practising
your apologies in two languages.

708
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,194
You're positive Foussard was The Cat?

709
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,233
We have no reason
to change the story.

710
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:55,514
- That's hardly a direct answer.
- I cannot give another. Excuse me.

711
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,838
One more point, Lepic.
This is a cheque for $280,000.

712
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:04,477
That's nearly 92 million francs.
Since you've killed The Cat...

713
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,831
He killed himself
attempting to escape justice.

714
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,510
I've been instructed
to pay off the Stevens claim.

715
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:16,748
I'm disinclined to do so if recovery
of the jewellery is imminent. Is it?

716
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,032
- It will take time.
- Several centuries!

717
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,032
I just came in to congratulate you
on your capture.

718
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,870
All's well that ends well. The papers
have headlines, tourists can relax.

719
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,629
You, Lepic, got your publicity
and a commendation from Paris.

720
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:42,197
Everyone got some good out of it,
except Hughson's company.

721
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,710
- But they can afford it.
- It has cut their assets.

722
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:51,159
Poor Foussard. Never guessed
it was him, a wine waiter.

723
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,316
Family man, wooden leg.

724
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:02,798
Didn't you know? Certainly. He lost it
during the War. That's remarkable.

725
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,552
A man with a wooden leg climbs up
walls with the agility of a cat.

726
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,911
- Is that true?
- I believe he had a bad leg.

727
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:15,510
You showed good taste
keeping it out of the newspapers.

728
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,790
I'll drop into Foussard's funeral,
pay my last respects.

729
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,630
Oh, and get a look at the real Cat,
who'll be there purring.

730
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,791
- You know who the real Cat is?
- I do.

731
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,310
- Tell the Commissioner.
- He wouldn't believe me.

732
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,671
- Try me.
- You'd find it hard to believe.

733
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,078
When I catch The Cat with
a handful of stolen diamonds...

734
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:43,670
It's because I gave this story
you're at liberty.

735
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,555
If I catch you on a roof,
I'll call the reporters again.

736
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,514
Lepic, that's all I wanted to know.
Good day.

737
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,073
- A most unhappy affair, Robie.
- Because it isn't me down there?

738
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,833
Poor Danielle.
I have a great compassion for her.

739
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,197
I'll look out for her.

740
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,153
What happened to the stuff he stole?

741
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,319
That's a mystery. The police
have looked in every place.

742
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:08,916
- Some day, it'll turn up.
- The boys owe you many thanks.

743
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,678
- For what?
- You know.

744
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,350
For risking prison to capture The Cat.

745
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,437
Oh, that.

746
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,918
But you have no reason to complain.

747
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,634
Could you be a little more specific?

748
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,673
The American girl, what's her name?

749
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,354
Francie Stevens, that the one?

750
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,391
What luck.

751
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:38,948
A beautiful woman with love for you,
rich beyond your dreams.

752
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,278
- I dream pretty rich.
- When are you going to America?

753
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,357
I didn't know I was.

754
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:50,148
You will make a great mistake
if you don't marry her

755
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,352
and return to your native country.

756
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:59,908
Let's talk about it at the Sanford gala,
between your catering duties.

757
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,793
- You are not invited.
- I will be.

758
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,994
- What costume will you wear?
- Something to surprise you.

759
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,879
Good luck.

760
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,870
Killer!
It's because of you he is dead!

761
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:41,558
Get out! Get out of here!
Killer, <i>voleur,</i> murderer!

762
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,519
John?

763
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,634
John?

764
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:39,797
- Will you make it hard to apologise?
- Not at all, I'm sure you're sorry.

765
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,154
You know I am. I had no idea
of the things you were up against.

766
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,916
What are your plans now?

767
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,680
- Now what?
- That the cat burglar's dead.

768
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,475
Foussard isn't The Cat.
The man had a wooden leg.

769
01:23:55,680 --> 01:24:01,038
- Wasn't he trying to rob a villa?
- He was trying to kill... me.

770
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,118
- Why?
- I was too close to The Cat.

771
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,074
- Who killed him?
- If I find out, I'll let you know.

772
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:11,033
- Bye, Francie.
- John, why bother?

773
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:17,517
- It's a hobby of mine, the truth.
- Let me do something to help you.

774
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:22,510
No, thanks. You've made your apology.
Let's go back to mutual disregard.

775
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:29,669
Mr Robie, I was wrong about you,
I think. You might be wrong about me.

776
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,716
Well, I may never know.

777
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,036
- Pardon me...
- I won't pardon you!

778
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,713
I'm in love with you.

779
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:48,592
- That's a ridiculous thing to say.
- Is it?

780
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:54,195
- To you, words are just playthings.
- Were playthings.

781
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:02,915
- I'll make you a sporting offer.
- I don't know if I'm up to it now.

782
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,069
Get me an invitation to the Sanfords.

783
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:11,119
- You can't go without a costume.
- What are you wearing?

784
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,790
Louis XV. Mother and I
got them in Paris.

785
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,672
I'll phone you in a day or two.

786
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,599
You probably wonder why I want to go.

787
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,074
I have an idea.

788
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:28,990
I thought you might like to see
a real burglar in action.

789
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,077
Will it be dangerous?

790
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,114
Not for tourists.

791
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:25,993
We're in! Any man without a lady
on his arm can only be a policeman.

792
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,671
- My nerves could stand a drink.
- Your nerves and your mother!

793
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:11,269
There they are, Commissioner Lepic
and one of his men.

794
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:15,075
Wigs, pantaloons and flat feet.
Come on.

795
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:25,314
My heart pills! I can't drink
champagne without my pills.

796
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,150
- Where do you think you left them?
- In our room. They're in my purse.

797
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:35,115
- Be a sweetie, John, and get them.
- Of course. I'd be delighted.

798
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,834
- Mother!
- All I said was...

799
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,554
Never mind what you said.

800
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,196
Thank you, dear.

801
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,317
Shall we dance?

802
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:21,277
Well, I hope the London office
appreciate what I've done for them.

803
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,755
My feet are killing me.

804
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,315
Mother was quite an actress.

805
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,239
She played her part well.
Heart pills!

806
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:35,830
I didn't think this scheme of yours
would work, Francie. But it has.

807
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:23,034
I figured it was you the night your father
died. You always did his legwork!

808
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,874
Come down!

809
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:42,155
Come down
or we shall be forced to shoot!

810
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:17,830
- He's not The Cat!
- What does he do on that roof?

811
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,713
- Your job.
- I only believe what I see.

812
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:24,435
- Shoot him and I'II...
- Robie's where I knew he'd be.

813
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,998
He's not alone up there.

814
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:26,639
- Pull me up!
- Don't shout, it makes me nervous.

815
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,434
- Then drop me.
- Whatever you say.

816
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,632
You've got a full house.
Begin the performance.

817
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:36,628
- What performance?
- Tell them who is really who.

818
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,717
Please, I might slip.

819
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:43,198
- I can hold you for 30 seconds.
- I did it for my father.

820
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:47,109
That's fine, but I already know.
Tell them down there.

821
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:50,995
- I kill you when I get up there.
- Tell them.

822
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,272
I was working for my father!
Now, please!

823
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:58,950
- Your father is dead. Who else?
- That's all.

824
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,435
My fingers are beginning to open.

825
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:07,351
Tell them who was behind it. Who knew
as much about me as I knew? Go on!

826
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,879
- Bertani's was behind it.
- You're telling them, remember.

827
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,594
- Bertani's was behind it!
- That's right.

828
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,836
Now, please, I'll die!

829
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,316
- Who brought you here?
- The police.

830
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:52,798
We'd have caught you if my dress
hadn't got caught on the gear shift.

831
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,310
- I only just said goodbye.
- As quickly as you could.

832
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,556
- Didn't I thank you?
- Politely.

833
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:01,752
You left in such a hurry
you almost ran!

834
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,837
I had work to do up here.

835
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:08,318
Were you afraid to admit you just
can't do everything by yourself?

836
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,875
You needed the help of a good woman.

837
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:14,072
You aren't the Ione wolf
you think you are.

838
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:18,717
Without you I couldn't have done it.
I needed the help of a woman.

839
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:23,668
I guess I'm not the Ione wolf
I thought I was, Francie.

840
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:29,436
Well, I just wanted to hear
you say that. Thank you.

841
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:34,237
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

842
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:52,235
So this is where you live.
Mother will love it up here!

843
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:09,234
