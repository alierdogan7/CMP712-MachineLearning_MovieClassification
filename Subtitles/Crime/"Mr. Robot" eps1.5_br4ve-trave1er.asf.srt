this ridiculous miracle,

350
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,321
and odds are you won't,
you die and so does Shayla

351
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,731
That much we know.

352
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,802
But assume for a second
that you do pull this off,

353
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,325
bust Vera out of prison.

354
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,761
Who's to say he doesn't
kill you, Shayla, Darlene?

355
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,002
It would be in his own
best interest to do that.

356
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,367
Either way, you
all end up dead.

357
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,442
It's the only way Vera wins.

358
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,931
Zero-sum, Elliot.

359
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,730
You're playing a game
you already lost.

360
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,245
You know I'm right.

361
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,448
No, there's gotta be a way.

362
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,765
I can think of a way.

363
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,489
I get it, kiddo. You want to
help people, watch over 'em_

364
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,450
Best thing you can do for Shayla,
allow her to become a memory.

365
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,041
No.

366
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,891
True courage is about being
honest with yourself,

367
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,124
especially when
it's difficult.

368
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,206
There's no plan where both
you and Shayla survive.

369
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,244
I can think of a way.

370
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,247
This new world that we are so
close to creating will never be.

371
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,646
And that new world, that is
success, f society is success.

372
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,485
Look at what you accomplished
at Steel Mountain.

373
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,800
That got us nowhere.

374
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,884
You took them down.
You won that battle.

375
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,324
This... This is failure.

376
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,607
This is the old Elliot.
The one who turns to morphine,

377
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,370
to drugs when he feels weak.

378
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,921
A coward, who can't
face the truth,

379
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,082
even though it's staring
him right in the face.

380
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,649
ELLIOT: There's
that sensation again.

381
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,240
Fight-or-flight.

382
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,766
Three lives at stake,
including my own.

383
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,768
I, ElliotAIderson, am...

384
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,846
What?

385
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,525
Tom Petty, Pink
Floyd, Van Halen...

386
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,402
What's up, man? You ain't
got no Drake, no Pitbull,

387
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,005

388
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,645

What's up, Rain Man?

390
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,884
I'm ready to bust Vera out.

391
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,886
I can get into the network.

392
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,608
We need to go
to the jail, now.

393
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,325
She stays here.

394
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,526
No, I'm not leaving you.

395
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,683
Don't worry, he's in no position
to be giving out orders.

396

Let's go, girl.

397
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,047
ELLIOT: Remember when the panic
would set in and we had a solution?

398
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,605
To be honest, I miss that.

399
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,160
Life is so much easier
when you're numb.

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,691
What's the plan,
bitch boy?

401
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,523
First Shayla,
now Darlene.

Yo, what the f...
Elliot, what are you doing?

403
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,847
ELLIOT: Like a hard drive blasted by
excessive voltage, my mind is frayed,

404
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,570
close to fried.

405
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,611
I can feel the static
running through my brain.

406
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,564

I need more time.

408
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,600
Tonight, tonight, tonight.

409
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,001
More time, right now.

410
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,889
I'm working on our
project as we speak,

411
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,123
so it's in your best interest
to keep talking with me.

412
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,203
At the security desk,
my cell phone's running

413
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,726
an undetectable,
activated signal sniffer

414
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,929
that will locate any kind of
wireless signal in sight.

415
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,287
By the time I
leave this building,

416
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,084
I 'll own its network.

417
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,245

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,526
But stupid.

419
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,683
You showed your face,

420
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,524
and then I skip
out tonight...

they're gonna finger?

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,367
That way, they can't
trace it back to you or me.

Woo!

427
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,485
I told you, didn't I?

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,803
The universe got big
plans for us, bro.

429
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,481
Sit back down.

430
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,367
When you get out, I realize
you're gonna have to split.

431
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,801
You won't be able to
stay in the tri-state area.

432
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,127
Oh, I love this. Go on.

433
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,127
Wherever you go, you're gonna
need funding to keep surviving.

434
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,090
Which means, your whole operation
still needs to be making you money.

435
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,488
Come on, Elliot,
give it to me!

436
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,170
I hacked Isaac's phone.

437
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,640
He had everything, your crew,
shipments, the entire operation.

438
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,927
I took it all. I own
your whole world.

439
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,450
I need your word,
when this goes down,

440
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,363
Shayla and I go free.

441
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,563
You leave us alone. Forever.

442
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,805
If anyone tries to hurt us, if I even
see one of your guys following me,

443
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,042
I leak everything.

444
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,131
You're saying this knowin'___

00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,202
You can kill me anytime? Yes.

446
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,251
Yes. That's why I coded the leak
to auto-send every 24 hours

447
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,044
unless I continuously
disable it.

about the operation.

to leave tonight.

is to kill him in prison,

because if you don't,
you're dead.

he got in with the right crew,

500
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,962
how he got the
jump on some men.

That leaves you with
a zero-sum game.

504
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,724
If you don't get him out of jail,
he'll have you killed for failing.

Only way this works in your favor
is for you to kill him first.

with him inside anymore.

won't kill you afterwards?
