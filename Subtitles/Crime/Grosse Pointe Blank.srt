I'm gonna call you from Detroit,

170
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:38,072
and just make sure that you pick up
the dry cleaning and feed the cat, okay?

171
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,909
- Don't forget your identity.
- All right, thank you.

172
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,206
(HEAVY SIGHING)

173
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,626
Could you tell Dr. Oatman
that I'm on my way?

174
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,128
- Oh, yes, of course.
- All right?

175
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,631
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

176
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,009
I got invited to
my 10-year high school reunion.

177
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,637
I'm conflicted.
I mean, I don't know if I really wanna go.

178
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,430
It's in Detroit. You know, I grew up there,

179
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,765
but I just honestly
don't know what I have

180
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,434
in common with those people anymore.

181
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,770
I mean with anyone, really.

182
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,898
I mean,
they all have husbands and wives

183
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,483
and children and houses and dogs.

184
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,527
They've all made themselves
a part of something.

185
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,738
And they can talk about what they do.
And what am I gonna say?

186
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,991
"I killed the president of Paraguay
with a fork.

187
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,327
"How have you been?"

188
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,621
I'm just thinking it would be depressing.

189
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,456
It would be depressing.

190
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,793
Shouldn't you be taking notes
or something?

191
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,671
I'm not taking notes, Martin,
because I'm not your doctor.

192
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,589
Please don't start with that stuff again.

193
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,300
Martin, I'm emotionally involved
with you.

194
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,969
How are you
emotionally involved with me?

195
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,262
- I'm afraid of you.
- Afraid.

196
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,597
That constitutes emotional involvement.

197
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,434
It would be unethical to work
with you under those circumstances.

198
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,019
Think you're upset
because I told you what I do for a living,

199
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,730
you got upset, and you're letting it
interfere with our dynamic?

200
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,815
Whoa!

201
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,234
Martin, you didn't tell me
what you did for a living.

202
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,153
- Yes, I did.
- You didn't tell me what you did

203
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,656
for a living for four sessions.
Then you told me and I said,

204
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,991
"I don't wanna work with you."

205
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,036
And yet you come back every week
at the same time.

206
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,663
That's a difficulty for me.

207
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,832
On top of that,
if you have committed a crime

208
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,667
or if you're thinking about
committing a crime,

209
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,628
- I have to tell the authorities.
- I know the law, okay?

210
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,340
But I don't wanna be withholding.
I'm very serious about this process.

211
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,011
- And I know where you live.
- Oh, now, see?

212
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,473
That wasn't a nice thing to say. That
wasn't designed to make me feel good.

213
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,766
That's a kind of a
not-too-subtle intimidation,

214
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:34,021
and I get filled with anxiety when
you talk about something like that.

215
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,814
- I mean, that's...
- I was just kidding.

216
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,066
- The thought never crossed my mind.
- You did think of it.

217
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,735
You thought of it and then you said it.

218
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,945
And now I'm left with
the aftermath of that,

219
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,073
thinking, "I gotta be creative
in a really interesting way now

220
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,951
"or Martin's gonna blow my brains out."
You're holding me hostage here.

221
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,120
- That's not right.
- I just wanna work.

222
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,206
There's some issues that I need to
work on in my life.

223
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,000
I've read your books.
Your bestsellers on the top 20.

224
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,418
They were both ghost-written, Martin.

225
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,504
- What, Annihilation of Death?
- Yeah.

226
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,464
Kill Who? A Warrior's Dilemma?
I read it.

227
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,800
- New York Times top 20.
- Well, I don't know what to say.

228
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,220
What do you say to other patients?
How does it work?

229
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,429
Ask me how I'm feeling.

230
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,432
- How do you feel?
- I'm feeling uneasy, man.

231
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,853
I'm just dispassionate, I'm bored, I'm...
It's hard to stay in a good mood.

232
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,688
I have problems at work.

233
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,359
You know, concept-execution stuff.
And I'm just ill at ease.

234
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,278
I don't wanna suggest anything
that might be uncomfortable for you,

235
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,616
but you might consider, just consider
the possibility that part of your problem,

236
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,493
part of the thing
that's making you so miserable,

237
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,578
is the angst of killing a lot of people.

238
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,956
Maybe I'll just
put it in the background there.

239
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,582
Come on. If I show up at your door,

240
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,044
chances are you did something
to bring me there, okay?

241
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,338
- I don't care about that stuff.
- You don't care about what stuff?

242
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,589
You know, the morality.

243
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,674
Hmm.

244
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,009
I don't want to talk about work.

245
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,136
Because I don't think necessarily
what a person does for a living

246
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,097
reflects who he is.

247
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,474
So what do we do?
Do we talk about dreams?

248
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,017
What's next? What's the score?

249
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,270
We'll talk about dreams. It's your nickel.

250
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,773
Sure. I had another one about Debi.

251
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,942
That girl you're obsessed with?

252
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,902
Don't you think "obsessed"
is a strong word?

253
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,031
Recurring dreams of loss and pain
for 10 years featuring the same person?

254
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,077
Yeah, maybe it's a bit obsessive.

255
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,789
I had one where I was
that television mechanical rabbit.

256
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,667
- You know, with the...
- The battery bunny.

257
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,127
Yeah. I was the bunny.

258
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,212
That sounds like a very,
very depressed dream.

259
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,880
- Really? Why?
- Yes.

260
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,382
Martin, it's a terrible dream.

261
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,676
It's depressing to
dream about that rabbit.

262
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,345
It's got no brain, it's got no blood.
It's got no anima.

263
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,932
It just keeps banging on those
meaningless cymbals endlessly,

264
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,893
and going and going and going.

265
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,688
- Time is up.
- Time's up already?

266
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,815
You really wanna do half a session?

267
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,737
Can we just pretend like we have
a normal doctor-patient relationship?

268
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,656
I'll ask you a piece of advice,
you give me an answer.

269
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,658
You know, advice.
Should I go to the reunion?

270
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,703
- Yes, yes, get out of town.
- Thank you.

271
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,122
Go see some old friends,
have some punch.

272
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,790
- Visit with what's-her-name.
- Debi.

273
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,209
Debi. Don't kill anybody for a few days.

274
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,961
- See what it feels like.
- Give it a shot.

275
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,256
No, no, don't give it a shot.
Don't shoot anything.

that you never met Martin Blank, okay?

302
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:46,273
No, 17 months ago, I was posting
a walk in Lisbon, and he was there.

303

He hasn't been in Lisbon since 1990.

- Read the file.
- No, actually, as a matter of fact,

I actually talked to him in Bonn.

You always have to know everybody.

Why don't I take the weekend off

and you kill him,
since you two are so close?

Oh, God.

You've been Detroit's most famous
disappearing act since white flight.

You look exactly the same, Mrs. K.

349
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,511
- You look great is what I mean. Great.
- Thank you very much, Martin.

350
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,471
You have always been
very good at saying that

351
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,265
and not sounding like a kiss-ass.

00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,854
I mean, we thought Princeton, Harvard.

354

You fooled us all
in the teachers' pool and went nowhere.

355

I guess you could say I went west,
you know?

Davy Crockett, the Donner party.

That's a barrage of imagery.

Are you still, you know, inflicting
all that horrible Ethan Frome damage?

359
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,786
- Is that off the curriculum?
- It's off.

360
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,372
- That's a horrible book.
- That's a very nice tie you have on.

You look like a mortician. I mean...

- You like it?
- Yeah, thanks.

00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,336
You still got that
Mary Tyler Moore thing.

Pick up. It's Martin Blank.

is gone, and it's an Ultimart.

a sentimental breakfast
from CuppaJoe's,

506
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,692
courtesy of the long-lost love of my life.

507
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,196
The man who vanished.

508
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,536
The man who is walking
right back into the station

509
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,247
and into my booth.

510
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,836
Sit.

511
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:54,268
Okay, let's take a random day.
Spring of '86.

512
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,355
Two young lovers
with natural chemistry.

513
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,482
- (MOUTHING) I'm on the air?
- (MOUTHING) Yeah.

514
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:06,572
A girl sits in a $700 prom dress

515
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,491
on the steps of her house,

516
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,535
waiting for the most
romantic night of her young life.

517
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,373
The boy never shows up, not until now.

518
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,500
So, what's the question?

519
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,336
Where have I been?

520
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,712
More like,
"What happened, Mr. Blank?"

521
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,673
I don't know. I could venture a guess,

522
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,217
but it would sound like
a rationalization, a cop-out.

523
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,719
I thought coming home,
seeing some friends,

524
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,721
and I thought maybe seeing you,
of course,

525
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,432
would be the most important
part of that equation.

526
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,978
That didn't... That didn't come out right.
This... This isn't even my idea.

527
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,772
This whole thing
is my therapist's idea, really.

528
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,236
Is this bothering...

529
00:31:55,956 --> 00:32:00,251
Okay, so you're back a decade late,

530
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,545
and you're on some sort of
therapeutic assignment,

531
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,880
and you wanna sort things out with me.

532
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,717
So the question now becomes
do I allow you access to me,

533
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:11,304
- or do I call security?
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.

534
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,682
Grosse Pointe, I need your help,
555-WGPM.

535
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,767
Do you think maybe we could
get a cup of coffee,

536
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,145
and I could try to explain or apologize?

537
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,735
Come on, Marty, this segues
so nicely into my '80s weekend.

538
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,905
Should a once-brokenhearted girl
give a guy a second chance?

539
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,117
Let's go to the phones.

540
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,410
You're on the air.

541
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,579
- Hi, Debi, it's Gail.
- Oh, hi, Gail.

542
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,247
You know, I wouldn't take him back yet.

543
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:42,084
I'd make him jump through some hoops
for a while, walk over hot coals.

544
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,463
- Make him beg for it.
- Harsh. That's very harsh, Gail.

545
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,341
Do you think maybe we could
discuss this in a more discreet setting?

546
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,384
...beg like a beggar.
You know, come on.

547
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,762
Next caller, you're on the air.

548
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,265
Debi, man, it's Nathaniel.
I don't hear any real remorse.

549
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,851
I mean, I don't think I'd let
this guy back in your life.

550
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,562
And, dude, I'd make him
wear that prom dress.

551
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,939
DEBl: Does anybody else
have a question for Marty?

552
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,442
- I do, but he's a shifty one.
- Put that down.

553
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:10,237
I have a question for Marty.

554
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,324
- Next caller, you're on the air.
- Yeah, Debi, hi.

555
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,035
Long-time listener, first-time caller.
I love the show.

556
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,329
So, Martin, what, no yellow ribbons?

557
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,955
Didn't anybody miss you?

558
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,000
Don't you think you should tell her
why you're really in town, tough guy?

559
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,045
You know what we love?
We love tough guys like you.

560
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,174
Thanks. That was our own Michigan
Militia, with their latest chart topper.

561
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,968
Come on, people,
do I give this guy the time of day?

562
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,640
Marty, do you have any
deeply personal responses

563
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,684
- you wanna share with our listeners?
- (MOUTHING) No.

564
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,394
Okay, he's shaking his head no.

565
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,729
In radio, that usually signals
the end of the interview.

566
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,357
Grosse Pointe, Michigan,
I hear you loud and clear.

567
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,609
If you love something, set it free.

568
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:53,114
If it comes back to you, it's, well,

569
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,243
broken.

570
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,250
Damn it. Never trust my instincts.

571
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,446
Marty.

572
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,742
Paul.

573
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,327
- Don't leave me hanging, baby.
- Hey, man.

574
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,580
How the hell you doing?

575
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,542
Hey. Look at you.

576
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,043
- Walk with me, man.
- Sure.

577
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,087
- I got my car parked around the corner.
- Okay.

578
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:54,633
Yeah. Goddamn, I worried
you joined a cult or something, man.

579
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,093
Half expected you to
come back into town

580
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,887
in a fennel wreath and paper pants.

581
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,722
- No money in it.
- Says you.

582
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,975
- Look at you. You've gone respectable.
- I stopped pouting on the sidelines.

583
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,227
I got in the game,
joined the working week.

584
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,438
So why don't you valet park
your high horse, slick,

585
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,899
- and take it easy on your buddy?
- It was a cheap shot.

586
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,650
Yeah, it was.

587
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,112
- Man, let's catch up, huh?
- Yeah, let's catch up.

588
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:18,741
I got a real estate deal. I'm taking them
through a final walkthrough, you know.

589
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,576
- This your Beemer?
- Yeah.

590
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,744
In Detroit? That's sacrilege.

591
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,579
Well, you know, guess who I got it from?

592
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,457
- I have no idea.
- Bob Destepello.

593
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,751
- Bob Destepello sold you a car?
- Yeah, he did.

594
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,462
Didn't he break your collarbone
and steal your woman?

595
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,255
- PAUL: Yeah.
- BLANK: So you're in real estate, huh?

596
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,258
Yeah, I got a couple of newlyweds
with a decision-making disorder.

597
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:39,345
I'll just hold their hands
and reinforce their clarity.

598
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:42,181
Isn't there some sort of Frank Lloyd
Wright connection with this?

599
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,100
You know what? There is indeed.
For the life of me, I can't...

600
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,852
Blank!

601
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,443
Hey, Blank.

602
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,278
I was driving by, I saw you on the lawn.

603
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,281
I thought there was gonna be a problem
at first, before I recognized you.

604
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,742
Terry Rostand. How you doing? PHS.

605
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,036
Terry Rostand. Oh, yeah,
you were always the guy who was...

606
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,288
- Yeah, I remember you.
- Yeah, '86.

607
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,457
How you doing, man? You look good.
You became a cop.

608
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:11,126
- Nice badge.
- No, no, no. I'm not a peace officer.

609
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,628
This badge isn't
a meaningful symbol or anything.

610
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,463
It's a badge of my company.

611
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,341
We don't enforce the law, we execute
company policy for homeowners.

612
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,010
- I get it. Cool. Cool.
- Yeah.

613
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,805
- You mind talking a little shop?
- Sure.

614
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,849
When are you authorized
to use deadly force?

615
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,350
Well, you know, of course,

616
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,811
taxes provide your basic service,
police and whatnot,

617
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,646
but our customers
need a bit more than that.

618
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,732
So if we find you on the property,
you know, we do what we have to do.

619
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,735
So if I just look suspicious
on your customer's property

620
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:39,196
under those, you know,
heightened circumstances,

621
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,365
you have the authority to shoot me?

622
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,700
Correct.

623
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,910
Wow. All right, all right.
How'd you get the gig?

624
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,871
You know, they were hiring.

625
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,331
- It was only a two-week course.
- Yeah, that's good.

626
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,499
- You look good.
- Yeah, thanks.

627
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,626
It's a beauty. What more can I say?

628
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,712
You know, you'll be raising your family
in a work of art.

629
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,672
A work of art in a work of art.

630
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,757
Yeah.

631
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,759
Well...

632
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,928
I've always felt very temporary
about myself,

633
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,931
and looking at the two of you
in this house,

634
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,600
when my time comes, if it ever does,

635
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,311
I want a house like this,
I want a wife like you.

636
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:16,150
- And you'll be safe here.
- We really gotta go.

637
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:19,069
Okay, give me a call, you guys.

638
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,863
You're not gonna go through
another broker, are you?

639
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,781
Definitely not.

640
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,701
Cute couple.
I don't think they're buyers though.

641
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,037
I don't know if you're qualified
to make that statement.

642
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,372
From 11:00 to 3:00
I show the house, Terry.

643
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,374
They don't look like people
who'd use the, you know...

644
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,626
Did you get a call, Terry?

645
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,337
No, I was just driving by,
and, you know,

646
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,963
I saw some people milling
around the lawn here.

647
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,215
No, there was just me. I was right there.

648
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,259
Okay, that's what I thought.
I just came by.

649
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,304
I show people houses here,
and I'd appreciate if you don't show up.

650
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,098
I know, but you're coming around
in the neighborhood unannounced...

651
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,893
- Did you get a call?
- No, but you don't know the alarm code.

652
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,603
- Did you get a call?
- No, they go off.

653
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,980
Okay, you're gonna have to go.

654
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,732
I'm more a part of this
neighborhood than you are.

655
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,983
And besides, a lot of times

656
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,402
you don't know the alarm codes
when you're checking,

657
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,488
- and the alarm goes off.
- Wow.

658
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,657
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

659
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,247
Well, I'm sorry about
the temporary thing...

660
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,249
No, don't worry about it, I don't even...

661
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,085
Listen, I don't usually pimp my friends,

662
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,129
but I got an excellent piece of property
you might want to look at.

663
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,465
- I got a few minutes.
- I gotta get something off my chest.

664
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,843
- Have you been to see the old house?
- Yeah. They tore it down

665
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:28,263
- in the name of convenience.
- Yeah, I brokered the deal.

666
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,976
I tried to get a family in there,
but Ultimart made the best offer.

Of course you don't know.

with this woman.

00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,795
- Don't worry about a thing.
- Debi, I love your show.

834
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,548
- It's so timeless.
- Yeah, it does run a little long.

835
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,342
- Marvin, are you here for the reunion?
- Sure.

836
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,220
- Where you been these last 10 years?
- Yeah, Marv, where you been?

837
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:53,680
You look great.

838
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,558
- I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
- You do not.

839
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,269
I do. I sell biscuits and gravy
all over the southland.

840
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,813
You're so funny. He's a funny guy.

841
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,357
You know Tim, my husband?

842
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,193
Why don't I get you another
drink and you can catch up?

843
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,487
Could I have a Stoli with three olives
and an onion?

844
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,740
- Yeah.
- I'll have what she's having.

845
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,408
Sure.

846
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,498
Hi.

847
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,799
Girl down there,
she doesn't trust me anymore.

848
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,593
I don't know why.

849
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,511
I'm trying to earn back her trust.

850
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,356
I'm gonna go finish my drink,
walk her to the car,

851
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,941
I'll be at the hotel in a half hour.

852
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,860
I'll see you there?

853
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,951
- That's him.
- Yeah, we know, thank you.

854
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,745
We've been following him around.

855
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,455
What's the problem here?
You guys on an hourly rate?

856
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,333
If we observe the subject
in an illegal act,

857
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,503
only then can we intervene
and terminate.

858
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,671
Yeah.

859
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,256
Why don't you just go
and shoot the fucker, huh?

860
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,259
Because we are not assassins,
Mr. Grocer.

861
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,388
- We work for the American government.
- Hey, he's coming back.

862
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:21,768
(MOUTHING) He's not coming back.

863
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,357
Fuck you guys.

864
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,610
- Hey, I don't appreciate being hosed.
- (LAUGHING)

865
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,363
You're exactly the same.

866
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,614
So are you.

867
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,283
- I am? How so?
- Just like I remembered you.

868
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,285
Yeah? Troubled?

869
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:42,414
I'm troubled? Yeah. I got...
I got a few problems. Don't you?

870
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,165
- Sure.
- Yeah? What'd you do?

871
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,917
I tried everything, you know.

872
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,837
I went to the nutritionist, the herbalist,
the psychiatrist.

873
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:53,216
- That's quite a list. Any of it work?
- I can't tell, but you gotta try, you know?

874
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,552
- It's your duty.
- Yeah, patriot, sure, sure.

875
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,471
- Yeah.
- So tell me more about your problems.

876
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,142
And I'll tell you about mine
and then we'll solve them tonight.

877
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,226
(LAUGHS)

878
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,186
Not so fast.

879
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,606
- You're still in the penalty box.
- Right, right, right.

880
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,569
Well, thanks for coming to see me.

881
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:17,115
- So is there a Mrs. Mysterio?
- No, but I have a very nice cat.

882
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,908
- Not the same.
- You don't know my cat.

883
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,368
It's very demanding.

884
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,913
- It? You don't know if it's a boy or a girl?
- I respect its privacy.

885
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,085
- Are you happy?
- Kind of.

886
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,463
- Really?
- Sort of.

887
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,339
We'll talk soon?

888
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,133
Okay.

889
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,140
That's a nice ride.
Nobody buys American anymore, huh?

890
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,114
(PHONE RINGING)

891
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,326
- Hello.
- Marcella, what do you got?

892
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,037
Hey, that town is hot.

893
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,581
I got the stink from
an assistant over at Rothschild's.

894
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,665
We prepped together.

895
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,210
I downloaded everything,
so just call it up.

896
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,003
I'm online.

897
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:18,343
We've got Steven Lardner, a.k.a. Steve,

898
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:21,179
and Kenneth McCullers,
no pseudonym.

899
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,765
Steve was a red-shirt tailback
from Ohio State.

900
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,976
McCullers, all-American wrestler
from Northwestern,

901
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,479
- MBA from the same.
- What are they doing here?

902
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,398
Well, they're domestic
covert operatives for the NSA,

903
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:36,027
up there as part of
a new get-tough-on-terror campaign.

904
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,239
They're looking for an Oswald,
a patsy to take the fall.

905
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,616
- Grocer fed them you.
- Grocer set me up?

906
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,201
- Surprised?
- No.

907
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:44,953
They were supposed to
catch you in the act,

908
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,455
but I guess they weren't
quick enough, right?

909
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,585
- Who's the ghoul?
- Well, this guy is a badass.

910
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,129
Felix La Poubelle.

911
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,466
An accomplished amateur
with the Basque Nationalists.

912
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:01,094
A few odd jobs
with the Algerian separatists.

913
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:05,640
Went pro with a stunning debut
aboard an elite Caribbean cruise liner.

914
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,767
That's where I know him from.
He's an asshole.

915
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,644
Did loan-outs for LikkenBakken.

916
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,982
Enjoys Native American art,
ballroom dancing, pornography...

917
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,692
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is he here for?

918
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:19,195
It's part of that Oregon snafu
with that dog, Budro.

919
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,532
You're gonna get out of there, right?
That's not right. You gotta get out.

920
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,577
- You're on a flight tonight, right?
- It isn't done.

921
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:27,996
This is not good.

922
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,164
I'll do it tomorrow, it's fine.

923
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,208
Sir, I'm beginning to
worry about your safety.

924
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,585
Look, I have to go.

925
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,671
Yeah, we all have to go sometime, sir,
but we can choose when.

926
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,299
No one chooses when.

927
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,679
(WITH A JAMAICAN ACCENT)
You can't come in.

928
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,975
Well, I was in the neighborhood,
so I just stopped by.

929
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,434
Wanted to say hi. Can I come in?

930
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,940
You can come in, but only for a second.

931
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,827
Unbelievable.

932
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,163
It's exactly the same.

933
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,166
It's a shrine. It's only temporary.

934
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,836
My apartment burned down
on Devil's Night.

935
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,879
Really.

936
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,465
So you never gave me an answer.

937
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,468
- I said we'd talk later.
- Well, this is later.

938
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,137
See, I figure if we go together,

939
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,055
we have a better chance
of getting out alive.

940
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:55,393
You know, we can partner up,
watch for traps, you know, go tandem.

941
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,311
I think it'd be a lot safer
than if we lone-wolfed it.

942
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,190
I have to say I'm curious
as to what 10 years has done to you.

943
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,400
You, too.

944
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,028
Is...

945
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,447
Is that the same bed?

946
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:08,823
Uh huh.

947
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,617
The magic bed.

948
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,746
The magic carpet. Wow.

949
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,668
I'll tell you what. I'll give you an answer
if you give me an airplane.

950
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,171
- Okay.
- Cool.

951
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,258
- Ready?
- Okay.

952
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,428
- Keep your feet low.
- I remember.

953
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,597
It's been 10 years.

954
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,433
- Fly, be free, be free.
- I'm flying.

955
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,684
(IN JAMAICAN ACCENT) Emancipation.

956
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:39,062
- Are you free?
- Of course. Okay.

957
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,230
- What if your dad comes in?
- You can give him one, too.

958
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,817
Okay. You can pick me up at 7:00.

959
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:48,863
Put me down. You can pick me up.

960
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,245
Okay, you can go now.

961
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,081
You want me to leave right now.

962
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,042
You don't wanna, maybe, watch CNN,
Crossfire, something romantic?

963
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:05,588
- No, airplane was quite enough.
- Okay, I'll go. That's fine, I'll go.

964
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,465
But this night, tomorrow night,

965
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:11,135
the reunion is gonna be
an important step

966
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,931
in our, you know,
burgeoning relationship.

967
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,266
You're a fucking psycho.

968
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,269
Don't rush to judgment
on something like that

969
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,105
until all the facts are in.

970
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,649
- I'll just let myself out.
- Go.

971
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,152
And, you can, you know,
lock the door behind me,

972
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,905
because, you know,
a lot of undesirables around.

973
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,407
I'll call you. I'll go.

974
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,086
Oh, shit, there he is.

975
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,677
Man, why don't we just do his job
so we can do our job

976
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,137
and get the fuck out of here?

977
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,722
What do you mean do his job?

978
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,933
What am I, a cold-blooded killer?
I'm not a cold-blooded killer.

979
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,435
- Now, wait a minute...
- No, you wait a minute.

980
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:05,189
You wanna kill the good guy,
but not be the bad guy.

981
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:09,443
Doesn't work like that. You gotta wait
until the bad guy kills the good guy,

982
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,946
then when you kill the bad guy,
you're the good guy.

983
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,116
So just to clarify,

984
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,952
if we do his job, we're the bad guys.

985
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,621
And if we do our job,
we're the good guys?

986
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:24,667
- Yes.
- That's great.

987
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,002
(BOTH LAUGH)

988
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,045
Hey, hey.

00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,508
Hi, Mr. Grocer.

990
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,388

991
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,655
Easy there, chief.

992
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:58,868
I don't see "Hollow-point wound care"
on the menu.

00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,412
Up, up, up.

tell you about some of our specials.

Or there's Gatsby's West Egg Omelet.

998
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:16,427
If in the mood for something different,

999
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,721
there's the
I Left My Heart in San Francheezie.

1000
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,932
- What'll you have?
- Two poached eggs.

1001
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:23,976
Scrape off the milky white stuff.
Hash browns well done.

1002
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,770
English muffin for the bread,
and a coffee.

1003
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,606
Wholegrain pancakes
and an egg-white omelet, please.

1004
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,191
What would you like in your omelet?

1005
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,236
- Nothing in the omelet.
- That's not technically an omelet.

1006
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,112
I don't wanna get in
a semantic argument.

1007
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,240
I just want the protein, all right?

1008
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,201
Come on there, ice man, live a little.

1009
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,453
Let Chef put a little cilantro
for your liver.

1010
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,956
- I don't want that.
- Little onions for the blood.

1011
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,085
- What are those?
- Nutrients.

1012
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,214
Here's the new stuff, kid. Durazac 15.

1013
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,716
Makes Prozac feel like a decaf latte.

1014
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,178
- You want a couple? I got jars.
- I don't do that stuff anymore.

1015
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:02,807
No wonder you got the shakes.
Don't say "do it," because I don't "do it."

1016
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,559
I ingest it on orders
from my neurophysiologist.

1017
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,688
It's legal. In five years,
they'll be putting it in the water

1018
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,731
- for the citizens, like fluoride.
- Fascinating.

1019
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,149
Is there anything
you wanted to talk about?

1020
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,859
I was gonna have breakfast.

1021
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,612
I heard about
that little blow-up at the Ultimart.

1022
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,282
- It was a wicked, ripping shame.
- One of your fraternal brothers?

1023
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,533
No.

1024
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,245
Hey, listen, I wanna work with you.
That was some indie frog.

1025
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,164
Some Basque whacker
from the Pyrenees.

1026
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,834
You sure Oregon doesn't ring a bell?

1027
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:33,004
Pacific Northwest,
a couple of months ago?

1028
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,299
Something about you doing
some wonder dog named Cujo?

1029
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,466
(SCOFFS)

1030
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:41,387
- Budro. Yes, Budro. Jesus Christ.
- Those dogs.

1031
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,348
Yeah, I was out there trying to whack
these three junk-bond fuckos.

1032
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:48,060
And these idiots were flushing game
with sticks of dynamite.

1033
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:51,022
And the dog that they borrowed,
little Budro, was a retriever. Get it?

1034
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,317
Budro was never a target.
Budro was acting on instinct.

1035
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:56,819
I would never hurt an animal.
I'm offended at the accusation.

1036
01:00:56,903 --> 01:01:00,031
Whoa, Chatty Cathy, clip your string.
I don't need to know.

1037
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,532
But just for the record,
here's what I heard.

1038
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:05,119
The marks borrowed
your client's prized hunting pup.

1039
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:08,622
So bad luck for Budro,
and bad luck for Blank.

1040
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:11,834
Poodle pumper. Hound hitter.

1041
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,962
- Pooch puncher.
- Let's not talk about Budro, huh?

1042
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:17,631
What about those two guys
in a Caprice Classic outside?

1043
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,301
The word is you turned
two governments on me, you turncoat.

1044
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,427
- Me?
- You.

1045
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,221
- Go G? On you? Never.
- Yes. Yes.

1046
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,351
Listen. Why don't we
get our relationship straight?

1047
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,312
I didn't get into this business
to have any relationships.

1048
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:34,440
I don't wanna join your goddamn union,
all right?

1049
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:37,360
Loner. Lone gunman. Get it?
That's the whole point.

1050
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:39,445
I like the lifestyle, the image.
Look at the way I dress.

1051
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,657
Become a cop or something.
Have coffee in the morning with friends.

1052
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,159
Look, this is a one-on-one business.

1053
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,954
The minute you start relationships,
bad things start happening.

1054
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,500
If it'll make you feel any better,
I think this is my last job.

1055
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,503
- I believe that.
- What do you say we put away our guns

1056
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,922
and forget the whole goddamn thing
and have some breakfast, all right?

1057
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,804
No scabs. From now on,
all arrangements, all contracts,

1058
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,390
- all engagements are regulated. Got it?
- Meet the new boss.

1059
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,100
- Yes.
- No deal.

1060
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,603
Okay. But we're not gonna let you
do your little job here.

1061
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,021
- No?
- No,

1062
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:15,773
- because we're gonna do it for you.
- Is that right?

1063
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,817
After we do your job, we do another job.

1064
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,151
Tell me about it.

1065
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,112
I'm gonna put a bullet hole in your head.

1066
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,614
- I'm gonna fuck the brain hole.
- Nice talk, sugar mouth.

1067
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,660
- Hi.
- You had the not-a-omelet.

1068
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,954
(PLATES CRASHING)

1069
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,289
(HOOTING)

1070
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:41,966
(PHONE RINGING)

1071
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,218
Pacific Trident Global.

1072
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,469
Marcella, Oatman's
not returning my calls.

1073
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:47,430
I need you to find him right now.

1074
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:51,142
Try his office, try the car, try his club,
but I need you to find him.

1075
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,018
I'm already late for the reunion. Okay?

1076
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,728
- Okay.
- Patch him through the landline.

1077
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:57,231
- This thing's low on batteries.
- All right.

1078
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,905
Hi, how are you? Yeah.

1079
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,451
I'm a pet psychiatrist. Yeah, yeah.

1080
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:11,078
I sell couch insurance.

1081
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:14,206
And I test-market positive thinking.

1082
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,960
And I lead a weekend men's group.
We specialize in ritual killings.

1083
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:22,631
Yeah, you look great. God, yeah.
Yeah, hi, how are you?

1084
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,092
Yeah, how are you doing?
How are you? Good, hi.

1085
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:27,636
Hi, I'm Martin Blank, you remember me?

1086
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:31,432
I'm not married, I don't have any kids,

1087
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:34,727
and I'd blow your head off
if someone paid me enough.

1088
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:48,282
Oatman, listen, don't hang up.

1089
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,743
I didn't kill anyone.
Except some guy tried to kill me.

1090
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,537
If I see that guy again,
I'm gonna kill him, but not anyone else.

1091
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,207
Except the guy I was sent here to kill.
Anyway, I saw Debi.

1092
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,585
I'm on my way to the reunion with Debi.
I'm anxious, I wanna do a phoner.

1093
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,631
Okay. Repeat after me.
"I am at home with the me.

1094
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,550
"I am rooted in the me
who is on this adventure."

1095
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:09,720
I am at home with the me. I am rooted
in the me who is on this adventure.

1096
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:14,266
Good. Now take a deep breath
and realize that this is me breathing.

1097
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,352
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I don't understand.

1098
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,062
You want me to say it, or to realize it?

1099
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,772
- What?
- That I'm breathing.

1100
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:23,067
- Say it.
- This is me breathing.

1101
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:25,402
Good. Now go do that
for about 20 minutes.

1102
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:26,987
- All right, I gotta go.
- Okay.

1103
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,697
Keep it up. Don't kill anybody.

1104
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,699
Right.

1105
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,586
This is me breathing.

1106
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,717
Yeah.

1107
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,889
You're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

1108
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,948
This is not happening again.

1109
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,157
Flowers.

1110
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,827
- That's funny.
- As long as I get the laugh.

1111
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:04,418
Debi, you look beautiful.

1112
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,504
Yeah? Thanks. Okay.

1113
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,174
Hold on.

1114
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:13,260
My dad's down the hall.
He's dying to say hi to you.

1115
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:14,428
Sure.

1116
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,138
I'll go put these in
some rubbing alcohol.

1117
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,806
Great.

1118
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,110
Mr. Newberry, it's Martin Blank.

1119
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,866
Good evening. How are you?

1120
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,577
- Good evening, Mr. Blank.
- Sir.

1121
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,621
You've beaten the millennia.
I lose my bet.

1122
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,290
Yeah, it was completely
unavoidable, sir, so...

1123
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:45,959
Just wanted to say hello, and,
you know, ask you how you are.

1124
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,878
- Martin.
- How's business, tricks?

1125
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:48,962
I don't know where you've been

1126
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,465
since you abandoned my daughter
10 years ago,

1127
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:55,094
and I don't care. It's good that you left.
I'm glad that you did.

1128
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:57,721
You've grown up a bit.

1129
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:01,266
Did I have you figured wrong?

1130
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,352
Well, I don't know. I mean, I hope so.

1131
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,270
I visualized you in a haze,

1132
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,815
as one of those slackster,
flannel-wearing,

1133
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,859
coffee-house misanthropes
I've been seeing in Newsweek.

1134
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,153
No, no, no, I went the other road.

1135
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,156
Six figures.
Doing business with lead-pipe cruelty.

1136
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,158
Mercenary sensibility, you know?

1137
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,494
Sports, sex,
no real relationships with anybody.

1138
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,079
How have the years been treating you?

1139
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,749
Well, you know me, Martin, the same
old sellout. Exploiting the oppressed.

1140
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,917
Sure.

1141
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,504
"What a piece of work is man
How noble..."

1142
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,005
Fuck it.

1143
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,757
Let's have a drink
and forget the whole thing.

1144
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,676
I'd love to, but we're a little bit late.

1145
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,303
So I just wanted to say hello
and wish you the best.

1146
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,472
What have you been doing
with your life?

1147
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:43,851
Professional killer.

1148
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:48,480
Good for you. It's a growth industry.

1149
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:54,111
Okay, good seeing you again.

1150
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,593
Neutralize. Did I say neutralize?

1151
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,470
I'll give you 20 bucks for that.

1152
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,848
STEVEN: Okay, he's definitely fallen
for her.

1153
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:26,268
- Look at him.
- Her hair looks really nice.

1154
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,394
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1155
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:33,275
No, he's using her.
What a cruel bastard.

1156
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,903
I'm gonna enjoy killing
that son of a bitch.

1157
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:37,654
Me, too.

1158
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,491
- I should've worn a skirt.
- I should've brought my gun.

1159
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,368
- What?
- Should be fun.

1160
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:49,875
- I'm not going.
- I'll go.

1161
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,676
Welcome back, Pointers.
It's Arlene Oslott-Joseph.

1162
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:03,514
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

1163
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:06,892
- Martin. Blank.
- Martin Blank.

1164
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:10,938
Yes, why, you haven't changed a bit.

1165
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,148
- Don't say that.
- Hi, Debi.

1166
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:16,819
- Just love your show.
- Thanks. Well, you're our demographic.

1167
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:20,447
- You gone and got married, Arlene.
- Yes, I did, and three children.

1168
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:22,950
- It's really neat.
- Yeah.

1169
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:24,785
I had the yearbook pictures put on,

1170
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,079
so everybody knows
who everybody was.

1171
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,039
A special torture.

1172
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,545
- Yeah. Hi, it's Arlene Oslott-Joseph.
- Oh, well.

1173
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,340
Bye-bye now, kids. Hi. Now, let's see.

1174
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,052
- Who needs hard liquor?
- Me. How are you holding up?

1175
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,887
- A little shaky.
- Straight to the bar for us.

1176
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,849
- I'm starting to remember these faces.
- What can I get you?

1177
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,559
- Vodka rocks, double. Two.
- You bet.

1178
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,936
When do we start relating to anybody?

1179
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:54,064
I would say, any moment now.
Ken Alderosh.

1180
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,900
- Hey, hello, Martin.
- Hi, Ken.

1181
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:59,778
- Hi, yeah, super. Hi, Debi, how are you?
- Hey, Ken. How are you?

1182
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,781
- Isn't this great?
- Yeah. What's been happening?

1183
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,825
- Moss, Bryce and Fromeyer.
- Yeah?

1184
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:09,329
In divorce mainly, some property,
some personal injury, you know.

1185
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,914
Those all seem kind of related.

1186
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,165
(LAUGHING) Hey!

1187
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Hey, I'm gonna use that.

1188
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:15,043
- I'll take that line.
- Sure.

1189
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,588
Hey, let me give you a card here.
Wait a second.

1190
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:22,092
Actually, I've got a special one here
for top-shelf clients.

1191
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,511
- Don't forget to read the cap.
- Thanks a lot.

1192
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:26,680
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Sure, sure.

1193
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,765
Martin Blank...

1194
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,310
- Sorry, man, you slipped. Sorry.
- Take it easy, man.

1195
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:34,646
- Sorry, sorry.
- Hey, Martin, what's happening, man?

1196
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,565
- It's Nathaniel.
- Hi, yeah, sure.

1197
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,859
How's it going, man?
Hi, Debi. How you doing?

1198
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,612
- Yeah, still very Newberry, I see.
- Oldberry, I think.

1199
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:42,905
- How's it going, man?
- Good.

1200
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,073
Come and say hey to Eckhart.
He's right over here.

1201
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,368
- Hey, thanks for the pen.
- You remember Jimbo and Peanut?

1202
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,662
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

1203
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,498
- How's it going?
- They're good. They're big, real big.

1204
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,876
I'm supervising their training, man.
They're going pro.

1205
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,671
Strictly Greco-Roman, man, all torso.
I'm taking them on the wrestling circuit.

1206
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,382
Yeah. Hey, I got something
for you guys.

1207
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,134
I don't hear any real remorse here.

1208
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,179
I don't think you should
get back together with this guy.

1209
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,556
- Real, man. You were real, man.
- That was cold, man.

1210
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:12,059
I don't mean any offense.
I was speaking from the heart.

1211
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,019
- All right.
- What are you doing later?

1212
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,063
We're gonna go outside
and blow a fat one.

1213
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,190
Get charred and toasted,
just like in high school.

1214
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,275
We gotta go see somebody over there.

1215
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,987
- We'll come back and get toasted.
- Come back, have a drink. Later, man.

1216
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,991
- How are you?
- Great.

1217
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:30,535
- What happened?
- I was just telling him.

1218
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,914
It was like I was
sucked up into the cosmos,

1219
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:38,543
all the while surrounded by
these yowling, nebulous forms.

1220
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:42,631
- Pardon me?
- And then, I got to the threshold.

1221
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:47,844
(CHOKING UP) Mozart, music,
flowers and poetry.

1222
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,263
- You died?
- And came back.

1223
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,683
See, that's the beautiful part.

1224
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,017
How did you die?

1225
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:58,146
I lost it on some ice
and ended up in Lake Saint Clair. Yeah.

1226
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,441
- Wanna go somewhere else?
- Sure.

1227
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,027
- Maybe we can dance later.
- Okay, sure.

1228
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:05,612
Okay, bye.

1229
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,449
Hey, you know, I'm gonna go
say hello to Amy over there.

1230
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:11,535
- Okay.
- Okay.

1231
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:17,165
- Governor. How you holding up, baby?
- I don't know. How are you?

1232
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,251
Can't believe you haven't
cracked like a piñata.

1233
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,627
- Almost.
- You look good.

1234
01:12:20,712 --> 01:12:22,838
- You look Tony Robbins good.
- So do you, man.

1235
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,882
- How's that possible?
- I know, I know.

1236
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,551
Excuse me.

1237
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:28,802
- Martin Blank.
- Hi.

1238
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:32,973
- You look great. It's Jenny Slater.
- Jenny Slater, yeah. How are you?

1239
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:37,060
- This 10 years has been good for you.
- It's been good for you, too.

1240
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,688
Hey, Jenny Slater. Hey, Jenny Slater.

1241
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:41,773
Paul. Paul Spericki.

1242
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,025
- Paul?
- Yeah.

1243
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:47,571
Had 11 classes with you.
Did the precious metals paper for you.

1244
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:48,947
Oh.

1245
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,492
Okay. Well, I was looking
for some validation of my life,

1246
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:53,910
but apparently it came up short.

1247
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,329
- I thought that went well.
- It was good for you.

1248
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,498
- They said...
- How's the rest of the night been?

1249
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,083
It's been great. It's a festival of pain.

1250
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,086
The idea that they think
that you can't evolve.

1251
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,464
- But I'm saying that I...
- Excuse me.

1252
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,507
Hey, Jenny. Jenny.

1253
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,842
- Blank, Blank, Blank.
- Yeah.

1254
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,720
These people are driving me crazy,
acting like it was all great.

1255
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,473
The National Honor Society,
blue stars on their nametags.

1256
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,850
Like it matters that they were
in the club years ago.

1257
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,186
I don't wanna talk about the old days.
What did we have?

1258
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,229
- Archery.
- I couldn't stand that class.

1259
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,648
I appreciate you helping me...
Helping me hit my targets.

1260
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:24,858
- Sure.
- Check this out.

1261
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:29,154
- That's not right for this place.
- Listen, I gotta go, I gotta go, man.

1262
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:31,073
(POP SONG PLAYING)

1263
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,116
Marty.

1264
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,827
- Tracy, how you doing?
- Yeah, good.

1265
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,329
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

1266
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,580
So sit.

1267
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,083
So how you been?

1268
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,626
Great, I'm... I'm married.

1269
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,920
- And...
- Robbie.

1270
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,339
- Yeah.
- And how is it all?

1271
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,882
It's not like it was supposed to be, right?

1272
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,425
No, no, that's not true.

1273
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:51,676
- No?
- It's great.

1274
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,637
- Really?
- I'm so great.

1275
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:56,223
People think that when you get married
you lose your freedom.

1276
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:59,017
- Not true?
- No, it gets better and better.

1277
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,062
So how are you?

1278
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,189
How's your life?

1279
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,816
- In progress.
- Yeah?

1280
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,778
- Will you hold Robbie for a sec?
- No, I...

1281
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,696
I'm gonna get his bottle. It's okay.

1282
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,740
Go ahead.

1283
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,992
You won't break him.

1284
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,496
You spend the first year just trying
to keep these little guys alive.

1285
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,457
Yeah, I imagine they'd be
very vulnerable to the elements.

1286
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,542
Yeah.

1287
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:24,626
(POP SONG CONTINUES)

1288
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:29,047
'Cause love's such
an old-fashioned word

1289
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:33,760
And love dares you to care for

The people on the edge of the night

Caring about ourselves

1293

This is our last dance

1294
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,782
Hey. Last time I saw him he was in here.

1295
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:56,950
I know.

1296
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:00,537
- Look at him.
- Hey, what's your name?

1297
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,164
Robbie.

1298
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,915
Hey, will it disturb him if I hold him?

1299
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,668
No, no, he'd love it.

1300
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:09,546
Such a good little munchkin.

1301
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:12,757
Hey, bunny. Are you tired?

1302
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:16,011
- Are you tired, little one?
- Here, wait a minute.

1303
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,263
Let me get a picture.

1304
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,974
- Let me get a picture.
- Look, look up.

1305
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,854
- Hey.
- How you doing?

1306
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,023
- Nice to see you. Hey, Martin.
- How you doing?

1307
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,650
- I saw you over there.
- I didn't get a chance to talk.

1308
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,652
- Did you get a pen from Ken?
- Yes, I did.

1309
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:36,072
- Still look very nice.
- Well, we're having a good time.

1310
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,783
- Computer guy.
- Right, Bob, how you doing?

1311

Dan Koretzky.
I saw you over at your dad's dealership.

1312

Yeah, I sell BMWs.

You wanna do some blow?

What an incredibly sweet gesture,
but I think I'll pass.

Hi, Bob.

1320
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:58,929
It's me, Martin, from high school.

1321
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:06,728
I'm drawing a complete blank.

1322
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:11,900
- Hate to see it.
- I hate that.

1323
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,950
Bobby, get away from me.

1324
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:28,208
You know I had recurring dreams
about you? Did I tell you that?

1325
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:31,795
Like five nights a week for like six years.
Did I tell you that?

1326
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:36,466
You know, yesterday on the radio...

1327
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:37,968
When you publicly humiliated me?

1328
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,970
Yeah, well, you know,
no less than you deserve.

1329
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:46,977
I think... I think I was overly harsh
when I said that you were broken.

1330
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:50,063
Really? How so?

1331
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:51,898
I don't think you're broken.

1332
01:16:51,983 --> 01:16:53,733
No?

1333
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:59,698
- I think you're mildly sprained.
- What?

1334
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,200
- Nothing that can't be mended.
- Wow.

1335
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:05,495
I think... I think that's a compliment.

1336
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,666
Yeah, well...

1337
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,171
What was I gonna say?

1338
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:19,384
That you're glad you came back
and you're real happy to see me.

1339
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:22,387
Yeah, I am.

1340
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,431
I definitely am.

1341
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,891
I'm sorry if I fucked up your life.

1342
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,603
It's not over yet.

1343
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,322
- Do you have a wife in Arkansas?
- No.

1344
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,491
Do you wanna dance?

1345
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,368
Sure.

1346
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,203
Okay.

I don't feel well and neither do you.

You know,

1359
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,957
there's this big, black cloud
that's following you around,

1360
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:17,127
that you're gonna have to come out
from under before I'd even consider...

1361
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:21,464
That's just like you. A little rain follows
me to town and you just fall to pieces.

God, it's been so long,
I've forgotten who gets tied up.

- What?

- No, stop.

- Something.
- What?

1371
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:53,204
I know.

1372
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,000

Save a dance for me, now.

01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,970
I think the best thing
would be to go away

someplace quiet for a few weeks

1383
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:54,557

I should say goodbye to.

I'm gonna go cruise by my old locker
and then I'll meet you in front.

with my foot up your ass.

Do you really believe

1396
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:43,273
that there's some stored-up conflict
that exists between us?

There is no "us."

- Okay.

01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,172
When I left, I joined the Army.

1494
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:11,674
And when I took the service exam,

the only way to describe it.

I was loaned out
to a CIA-sponsored program.

1498
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:22,685

I was before, but I'm not now.

1501
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:30,151
But that's all irrelevant really.

1502
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,903
The idea of governments, nations,
is public-relations theory.

1503
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:35,447
I don't want the theories.
I wanna hear about the dead people.

Well, that's very complicated,

it matters,

of course, that you have something
to hang onto,

you know, a specific ideology
to defend, right?

1510
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:51,088
I mean, taming unchecked aggression,
that was my personal favorite.

1511
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:52,715
Others liked "live free or die."

But you get the idea.

But that's all bullshit
and I know that now.

1514

You do it
because you were trained to do it,

1515
01:31:57,971 --> 01:31:59,263
you were encouraged to do it,

1516
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:04,310
and ultimately, you know,
you get to like it.

1517
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,732
I know that sounds bad.

No, no, no.
A psychopath kills for no reason.

1520

It's a job. That didn't sound right.

Let me see if I can put it another way.

Newberry, Grosse Pointe, Michigan,

1660
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:53,542
winding down our all-vinyl reunion
weekend, Pointes High class of '86.

1661
01:42:53,626 --> 01:42:56,294
Some people say, "Forgive and forget."

1662
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:58,004
I don't know.

1663
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:00,924
I say forget about forgive
and just accept.

1664
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:03,885
And get the hell out of town.

1665

(ROCK SONG PLAYING)

1666
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:09,558
When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
and I'm so strung out

1667
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:14,187
I'm high as a kite, I just might
stop to check you out

1668
01:43:14,272 --> 01:43:19,192
Let me go on like I blister in the sun

1669
01:43:19,277 --> 01:43:24,614
Let me go on, big hands, I know
you're the one

1670
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:35,584
When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
and I'm so strung out

1671
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:40,338
I'm high as a kite, I just might
stop to check you out

1672
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:45,969
Body and beats, I stain my sheets
I don't even know why

1673
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:50,932
My girlfriend, she's at the end
she is starting to cry

1674
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:55,228
When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
and I'm so strung out

1675
01:43:55,479 --> 01:44:00,108
I'm high as a kite, I just might
stop to check you out

1676
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:05,363
Let me go on like I blister in the sun

1677
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:10,827
Let me go on, big hands, I know
you're the one
