Safe.

539
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:44,929
How's Mama?

540
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:48,440
She is missing you.

541
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,101
Tell her I miss her back.

542
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:53,111
I think she would love
to hear that from you.

543
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,681
I know.

544
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,947
What do we have?

545
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,109
[♫]

546
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,856
Remember the guy on the news
running a Ponzi scheme

547
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,390
about a year ago?
Mm-hm.

548
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:07,290
Made $50 million
and vanished into thin air.

549
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,829
Clever guy. Now he's
living in the Caribbean.

550
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:11,295
Oh.
Mm.

551
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:14,698
So left a lot of people very upset.

552
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,305
So we give him a break.
Permanently.

553
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,340
Okay.

554
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,507
There's something else.

555
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,484
How long has this
been going on?

556
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:42,657
Not long.
Newspaper says 22.

557
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,664
Why?
You know why.

558
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:47,530
Think this will
smoke Don Luis out?

559
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:51,901
You think he's that stupid?
it's not just about you, okay, Cataleya?

560
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,099
There's me, Mama, the family.

561
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:56,542
[BOTH SPEAKING IN SPANISH]

562
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,580
Tio, please. You're clean.

563
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,014
You book the work,
you collect the money.

564
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:06,518
Oh. How nice. And I watch your back.
That's what I do.
