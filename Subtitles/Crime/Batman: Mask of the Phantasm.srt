under this place...

673
01:03:32,773 --> 01:03:35,003
...and they're all filled
with high explosives.

674
01:03:35,173 --> 01:03:39,371
In five minutes, everything goes up.

[JOKER YELLS]

676
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:41,042
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

677
01:04:45,853 --> 01:04:47,889
What are you doing?

678
01:04:48,933 --> 01:04:52,482
You're crazy. I'm your only chance
to get out of here.

679
01:04:52,653 --> 01:04:55,008
Let me go or we'll both die.

680
01:04:55,173 --> 01:04:57,164
Whatever it takes.

681
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:22,129
For once, I'm stuck
without a punch line.

682
01:05:22,973 --> 01:05:24,326
Uh-oh.

683
01:05:25,613 --> 01:05:28,047
Okay. I give up.

684
01:05:28,213 --> 01:05:29,931
I surrendered already.

685
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,402
- Tell her, Batman.
- Andrea.

686
01:05:32,613 --> 01:05:35,286
You've got to get out of here.

687
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:38,650
This place is wired to explode.

688
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:41,845
No. One way or another,
it ends tonight.

689
01:05:42,373 --> 01:05:43,772
Goodbye, my love.

691

BRUCE:
Andrea!

692
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:15,969
I couldn't save her, Alfred.

693
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:18,328
I don't think she wanted
to be saved, sir.

694
01:07:18,693 --> 01:07:21,526
Vengeance blackens the soul, Bruce.

695
01:07:21,693 --> 01:07:25,368
I always feared you would become
that which you fought against.

696
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:29,282
You walk the edge of that abyss
every night, but you haven't fallen in...

697
01:07:29,493 --> 01:07:32,246
...and I thank heaven for that.

698
01:07:34,493 --> 01:07:37,610
But Andrea fell into that pit years ago.

699
01:07:37,773 --> 01:07:40,606
And no one, not even you,
could've pulled her back.

700
01:07:50,813 --> 01:07:52,405
What is it?

701
01:08:34,293 --> 01:08:36,329
- Quite a sight.
- Yes.

702
01:08:37,173 --> 01:08:41,052
I'm sorry. Do you wanna be alone?

703
01:08:41,213 --> 01:08:43,090
I am.
