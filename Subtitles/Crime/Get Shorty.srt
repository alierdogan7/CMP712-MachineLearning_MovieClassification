1
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,544
It's fucking cold outside.

2
00:00:23,213 --> 00:00:26,273
That guy on the radio said
it's going down to 34.

3
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:27,875
It's 34.

4
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:30,281
That's freezing, for chrissakes.

5
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:34,455
Yo, Chili.
What? You spacing?

6
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:36,717
They're closing down the Granville.

7
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:38,884
You know,
that theater down on Biscayne?

8
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:41,287
That guy owes Momo a couple G's.

9
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:44,228
I know. I was thinking
maybe Momo should buy it.

10
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:47,063
I could run it.
Show old Cagney movies.

11
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:50,638
Why would Momo want a theater
that shows movies no one wants to see?

12
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,539
Outside of making it a porno house,
he's not going to give a fuck.

13
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:57,443
I'm gonna go
talk to this Chili.

14
00:00:57,747 --> 00:01:01,183
-Besides, you got a job.
-Yeah. Yeah.

15
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:02,912
How you doing, Ray?

16
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:04,146
Good. You?

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,053
Okay.
Can you believe this weather?

18
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:09,087
Miami Beach, for chrissakes!

19
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:11,316
Chili Palmer.

20
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:14,319
It's chilly outside,
and it's Chili inside.

21
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:17,158
It's a regular fucking chilifest.

22
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,591
How you doing?

23
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:22,427
Obviously much better
than you, Chili.

24
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,198
That was a good one.

25
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:36,946
When you're done staring
out the window...

26
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:39,519
I'll meet you
back at the office.

27
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:55,566
-Where's my coat?
-It's not one ofthese?

28
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,470
Do you see
a black leatherjacket...

29
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,701
like Pacino wore in ''Serpico''?

30
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:02,735
-'Cause ifyou don't, you owe me $379.
-See the sign?

31
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:05,804
I didn't come to Florida
to freeze my ass off.

32
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:10,879
Find my coat or give me the $379
my ex-wife paid for it.

33
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:17,720
Wait a minute.
Ray Bones took my coat?

34
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:19,819
No, he didn't take it.
He borrowed it.

35
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,727
'Cause someone took his coat.

36
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:24,528
So Mr. Barboni tried this other coat.
It fit him good.

37
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,932
That was my coat.

38
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:28,562
He was wearing it home.
He's not gonna keep it.

39
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:30,629
My car keys are in that coat.

40
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:34,143
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.
He works forJimmy Capp.

41
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:37,036
I know who he works for.
Where's your phone?

42
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:38,444
This way.

43
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,075
Are you sure it was Ray Bones
that took the coat?

44
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:44,814
That's what the man said.

45
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:47,823
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather,
is going to be nice and warm.

46
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:50,052
-You don't need the coat.
-This is it.

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,491
Hey, Chili. Get the coat.
Just don't piss the guy off, okay?

48
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:57,790
Then we're gonna have to call Momo
and straighten the whole thing out.

49
00:02:57,934 --> 00:03:01,529
And Momo'll be pissed off for wasting
his time. We don't need that, eh?

50
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:04,937
Don't worry. I'm not saying
any more than I have to, ifthat.

51
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:29,028
Yeah, yeah.
Just a minute.

52
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:34,293
What!
Are you fucking nuts?

53
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:37,898
My nose!
My nose!

54
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:18,605
Holy shit!

55
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:21,512
Somebody call 9-fucking-1 -1 !

56
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:24,445
Somebody call 9-fucking-1 -1 !

57
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,784
What do you want me to do?
Go to war over a fucking coat?

58
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:33,861
You're lucky
the guy didn't kill you.

59
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,193
The coat was a Christmas present,
for chrissakes.

60
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,757
Listen to me,Jimmy.

61
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:41,702
You gotta do something about this guy.
He's running amok.

62
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:44,633
He's got no fucking respect
for none of us.

63
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:46,868
He's got no respect foryou.

64
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:50,140
I don't got to do shit.
Chili Palmer don't work for me.

65
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,976
He works for Momo
up in Brooklyn.

66
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:56,050
As long as Momo's around,
nothing happens to Chili.

67
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:58,153
Do you understand?

68
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,510
Over here.

69
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:05,590
We're here, Momo.

70
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:09,159
lhopeyou checkedthisplace outgood,
'cause l'mgoing in there alone...

71
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:11,493
andldon't want
no fuckingsurprises.

72
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,228
lcheckedeverything, Momo.

73
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:49,761
Who is it?

74
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:51,270
It's Momo.

75
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,102
Get in here.

76
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:00,876
Surprise!

77
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,822
Soyou're trying to say
you're nevergoing to sleep again?

78
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:26,589
No, I said I'm never going to bed.
There's a difference.

79
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:29,755
This article says
that most people die in their beds.

80
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,026
As long as I stay
out of bed, I'm safe.

81
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:36,094
What? That's the dumbest thing I ever
heard of. Where you gonna sleep?

82
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:39,933
In my recliner.
You know, the tan one in the TV room?

83
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:43,843
Or I'll go to a coffee shop,
slide into a booth, pull my hat down.

84
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:47,541
How many people you know
died in a coffee shop?

85
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:54,817
You cut straight hair in here
orjust fags?

86
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:59,284
Hey, Bones. That's quite a scar
you got on your head.

87
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:03,488
Why don't you have these guys fit you
with a rug, cover it up foryou?

88
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:06,228
You two geezers
take your game to the park.

89
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:11,135
This man is the man. You understand
what I'm saying, motherfucker?

90
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:15,744
He's Mr. Bones,
and you speak to Mr. Bones from now on.

91
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,309
You can do better
than him, can't you?

92
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:21,473
Not these days.
Not unless you speak Spanish.

93
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,080
You got a miss.
Leo Devoe. He's six weeks over.

94
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:26,314
He's dead.

95
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,380
How do you know?
Did he tell you?

96
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,585
Yeah, he told me
that he was dead.

97
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,991
Personally?

98
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:35,261
Yeah, he personally told me
he got killed...

99
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:37,595
in that getawayjet crash
that happened a month ago.

100
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,329
Maybe he took out flight insurance.
Check with his wife.

101
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,228
You check it out.
It's your book now.

102
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:45,897
He owns some dry cleaning store
over on Federal Highway.

103
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:49,805
Let me explain something to you.
Momo is dead.

104
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,679
Which means everything he had now
belongs toJimmy Capp, including you.

105
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:57,116
Which also means that when I speak,
I speak forJimmy.

106
00:09:57,286 --> 00:10:01,780
E.g., from now on, you start showing me
the proper fucking respect.

107
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,587
E.g. means ''for example.''

108
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,684
I thinkyou want to say ''i.e.''

109
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:08,524
-Bullshit. It's short for ''ergo.''
-Askyour man.

110
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:11,096
To the best of my knowledge,
e.g. means ''for example.''

111
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:15,631
E.g., i.e., fuckyou!
The point is: When I say, ''Jump...''

112
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:17,798
you say, ''Okay!''
Okay?

113
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:19,341
-Yeah. Okay.
-All right.

114
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:22,809
You owe me the dry cleaner's 1 5 G's
plus thejuice...

115
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,369
which is another...

116
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:29,911
2,700.

117
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:34,387
Get it from his wife or out of
your own pocket. I don't give a fuck.

118
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:37,890
But you never hand me a book
with a miss.

119
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:45,594
We'll see you, Ray.

120
00:10:46,402 --> 00:10:49,394
Go see the dry cleaner's wife.
You got three days.

121
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,767
I told you not to piss him off.

122
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:55,174
Don't say another fucking word.
All right?

123
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:56,646
[ Skipped item nr. 123 ]

124
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:59,240
I hate the dry cleaning business.

125
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:03,743
I hate being inside all day
around all those machines.

126
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,581
Must be hot.

127
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:08,417
You have no idea how hot it is.

128
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:13,184
You know, Fay, I was wondering...

129
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:15,693
did Leo have life insurance?

130
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,860
I don't know ofany.

131
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:26,436
I trust you, Chili.

132
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,044
I thinkyou're a decent type of man.
Even ifyou are a crook.

133
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:34,206
Thankyou. Thankyou, Fay.

134
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:37,544
I wish he really was dead.

135
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:40,221
He's a son ofa bitch.

136
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,392
That's him, all right.
Called himself ''Larry De Mille.''

137
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:52,127
Hit on every showgirl in town.

138
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,999
Tell them he was the ''Martinizing King''
of Miami. What a moron!

139
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:56,766
He's in L.A.

140
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,433
Put him on a plane.
He spanked one of my cocktail girls.

141
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:00,998
Leo spanked her?

142
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:02,237
Apparently...

143
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:04,836
he invites her to the track
to play the ponies with him.

144
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:08,247
She tells him what he can do with that.
He gives her one on the tush.

145
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:11,578
My guess, he's by his lonesome
at the track right now.

146
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:15,322
Ifyou go to L.A.,
this guy owes us 1 50 grand.

147
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,721
Sixty days over.
Some movie producer.

148
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:19,624
Movie producer?
Really?

149
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:22,460
-Why not?
-Appreciate that, man.

150
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:25,356
You're gonna love this guy.
Another fucking moron.

151
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:27,659
Harry Zimm.

152
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:42,507
Thanks a bunch.

153
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,180
-Where is it?
-It's right there.

154
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:50,117
-What is that?
-It's an Oldsmobile Silhouette.

155
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:51,790
I ordered a Cadillac.

156
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:54,020
That's the Cadillac of minivans.

157
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:55,857
Are you kidding me?

158
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:59,129
Ifyou want, La Tijera Car Rental
is right over there...

159
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,193
but I think all they got
is Rabbit convertibles.

160
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:07,365
I guess I'll take
the Cadillac of minivans.

161
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,121
Harry.

162
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:31,126
Goddamn it, wake up.
Somebody's downstairs.

163
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,531
What's wrong?

164
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:34,125
Somebody's downstairs.

165
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:35,634
Be quiet.
Listen.

166
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,802
I don't hear anything.

167
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:40,502
Right there.

168
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:44,706
That's the television.

169
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:47,743
When I came upstairs, you stayed
downstairs to finish your drink.

170
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:50,786
I told you to turn off
the television when you were through.

171
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:53,447
I also told you
you could sleep in the maid's room.

172
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:59,160
I did that. I turned the television off
with the remote thing...

173
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:01,286
then I laid it on the floor.

174
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:04,993
You know what could've happened?

175
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:08,897
The dog came in, stepped on it
and turned the TV back on.

176
00:14:09,038 --> 00:14:11,029
I don't have a dog, Harry.

177
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,307
You don't?

178
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,335
What happened to Muffy?

179
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,071
Are you going down there,
or do I go?

180
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,639
I'm going.

181
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:24,016
Hurry!

182
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:32,256
Anybody skimming the pool?
It needs it.

183
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:34,424
I'm going, I'm going.

184
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:38,293
I'm going to the bathroom.

185
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:39,857
I'm going.

186
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:59,785
Areyou on
the information superhighway?

187
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,345
No, notyet.

188
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:05,360
Where llive, with allthepremium
services, lget2,800 channels.

189
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:07,292
2,800 channels!

190
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,354
-2,800.
-No kidding.

191
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,560
Harry Zimm.

192
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:13,295
Jesus Christ!

193
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:16,060
How you doing?
I'm Chili Palmer.

194
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:19,073
Oh,Jesus. If I have a heart attack,
I hope you know what to do.

195
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:20,574
Where you been, Harry?

196
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:23,134
Have we met?
I don't recall.

197
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:26,306
Wejust did.
I told you my name's Chili Palmer.

198
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:28,407
You're in pictures, right?

199
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:31,317
Did you think what would happen
if I had a heart attack?

200
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:32,877
Look at me, Harry.

201
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:34,115
I am.

202
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,090
Keep looking at me.
Right here.

203
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:37,819
That's what I'm doing.

204
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:42,761
You know Dick Allen?
Mesa's Casino?

205
00:15:42,832 --> 00:15:46,268
That's what this is. You're a collector
for the fucking casino.

206
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,896
You come in here
in the middle ofthe night...

207
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:52,267
I thought you were an actor
auditioning, for chrissakes.

208
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,031
We'll see about this.

209
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,672
Operator,
let me have Las Vegas--

210
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,675
Harry, let me
give you some advice.

211
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:06,744
Don't act like a hard-on.
You're standing in your undies.

212
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:09,951
You want to sit
and talk to me.

213
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:15,694
Harry, a marker is like a check.

214
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:18,129
I know what a marker is.

215
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,966
They don't want yours to bounce.
That annoys them.

216
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:24,198
Your dear friend,
Dick Allen...

217
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:26,764
left messages on your machine,
and you haven't called back.

218
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:29,137
So he asked me to lookyou up.

219
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:32,374
So I follow you here,
and I see you in a window with a woman.

220
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:36,080
Looks like Karen Flores,
the actress from ''Grotesque.''

221
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:37,982
You're not looking at me, Harry.

222
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:40,715
-Why must I look at you?
-Because I want you to.

223
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,450
You're going to get rough?

224
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:44,990
I make good by tomorrow,
oryou'll break my legs?

225
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,823
Come on, Harry.
Mesa's?

226
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,157
You tell Dick Allen...

227
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:51,960
I'll cover those markers
in the next 60 days.

228
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:55,470
If he doesn't like it,
that's his problem. The fucking prick.

229
00:16:58,173 --> 00:17:00,733
So you want me to call you a cab?

230
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,566
You make movies?

231
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:06,340
I produce
feature motion pictures. No TV.

232
00:17:06,749 --> 00:17:08,683
You mentioned ''Grotesque'' before?

233
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:12,854
That happens to be ''Grotesque, Part II''
that Karen Flores was in.

234
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:16,014
She also starred in three
of my ''Slime Creatures'' releases.

235
00:17:16,091 --> 00:17:17,922
You may have seen them.

236
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:20,354
I got an idea for a movie.

237
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:36,707
Leo, he would wear...

238
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:40,109
plaid wool hats in Miami
in the middle ofsummer.

239
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:44,449
He doesn't want anyone
to think he's bald.

240
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,621
Say hello to Chili Palmer.

241
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,660
Chili, this is Karen Flores.

242
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,220
It's a pleasure to meet you.

243
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:58,396
How'd you get in the house?

244
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:01,728
Hejust told me an idea for a movie.
It's not bad so far.

245
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:05,103
Sit down, have a drink. Tell Karen.
See what she thinks.

246
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,165
Maybe you didn't hear me.

247
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:09,367
I came in the back door.

248
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:13,179
-You broke in.
-It was open. Wasn't locked.

249
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,244
-What if it were?
-Want to hear the idea?

250
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:19,378
It's about a dry cleaner that scams
the airline out of 300 grand.

251
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:20,681
Tell her.

252
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:22,246
Well, it's simple.

253
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:25,157
Basically, it's about a guy
who owes a shylock $1 5,000...

254
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:27,320
and he's three weeks over
on the vig.

255
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:28,886
The interest you have to pay.

256
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:30,158
I know.

257
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:32,860
Anyway, this dry cleaner--
Let's call him Leo.

258
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:35,793
He's scared. He doesn't know
any better. He leaves town.

259
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:39,303
So Leogets on aplane,
but theplanesits there. Doesn 't move.

260
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,344
Theyannounce there'ssome kind
ofmechanicalproblem.

261
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:44,072
They'llbe there maybe an hour...

262
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:46,910
but keepyourseats,
in case they fix itsooner.

263
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:49,883
Theguy's in no shape
to sit there, sweat it out.

264
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:51,783
So he gets offthe plane.

265
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:54,482
Hegoes to the cocktaillounge
andstarts throwing them down.

266
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:59,755
ln fact, he'sstillin the lounge
when theplane crashes on takeoff.

267
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:06,195
When theguy finds out it was
his flight, he can't believe it.

268
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,326
If he had stayed on the plane,
he'd be dead.

269
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:10,565
He knows his luck has changed.

270
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:14,803
Ifeverybody thinks he's dead, he won't
have to pay back the 1 5 or the vig.

271
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:16,276
Keep going.
Come on.

272
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:18,540
Since Leo's name was
on the passenger list...

273
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:20,738
they bring his wife
out to the airport.

274
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:23,614
They'regoing throughpersonaleffects,
whatever wasn 't burnedup.

275
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:26,553
Leo'sbags were on theplane.
The wife tells them what to lookfor--

276
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:28,749
things that onlyshe would
knowabout.

277
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:39,666
My Leo!

278
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,904
A couple daysgo by.
The airlinepeople visit his wife.

279
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:48,500
Theytellherthey'resorrytheirplane
explodedandofferhera settlement.

280
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:51,512
The amount basedon what he would
have earnedforthe rest ofhis life.

281
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:53,608
How much is she offered?

282
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:57,448
300 grand. So they take it.
Money in their hand, babe.

283
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,510
He gets his wife
to cash the check...

284
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:01,579
andhe takes offfor Vegas
with the dough.

285
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:03,557
Hegets there.
He'ssupposedto callher...

286
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,388
to let herknow
when to come out.

287
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:07,588
She neverhears from him again,
but he'shot.

288
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:10,496
He runs the300grand
up to halfa million.

289
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:12,557
-He comes to L.A.--
-But he's going nuts...

290
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:14,693
because he's winning,
and he can't say who he is.

291
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,863
So we show in a back story
his motivation, his desire to be famous.

292
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:21,034
He's got the dough
to buy his way in...

293
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,544
mix with the celebs,
and he can't resist...

294
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:24,943
so he comes to L.A.

295
00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:27,779
I don't know about the mixing
with the celebrities.

296
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,080
That was something new
that wasjust added.

297
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:32,143
But, yeah,
he comes to L.A. and...

298
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:34,946
I don't know
what happens after that.

299
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:37,014
What? That's it?
That's your movie?

300
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,083
I said that I had
an idea for a movie.

301
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:41,652
That's halfa movie
with holes in it.

302
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:43,795
There's maybe 40 minutes
ofscreen time.

303
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,164
You don't have a girl,
a female lead.

304
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:48,726
On top ofthat, you don't have
anybody to sympathize with.

305
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:51,568
-You don't have a good guy.
-The shylock is a good guy.

306
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,731
The shylock is barely mentioned...

307
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:56,369
and it's not believable the wife
would get a settlement that fast.

308
00:20:56,512 --> 00:20:58,844
Harry doesn't realize
it's a true story.

309
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:02,350
That Miami flight that went down?
It was on the news every day for a week.

310
00:21:02,484 --> 00:21:03,815
Harry must've been busy.

311
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:06,878
-That's where you got the idea?
-Part of it, yeah.

312
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:10,352
Wait a minute. You're not the guy?
The dry cleaner?

313
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:11,581
Leo.

314
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,651
You wouldn't be talking to me
ifyou were.

315
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:17,062
-No, I'm not the guy, Harry.
-But you work for the casino?

316
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:19,657
For God's sake, Harry,
he's the shylock.

317
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:21,896
That's what you do for a living?

318
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,165
That's what I did until recently.

319
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:27,101
After I'm done here,
I don't know what I'll do next.

320
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:29,307
I got an early call.

321
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:32,245
No problemo, babe.
Go on up to bed.

322
00:21:32,314 --> 00:21:36,842
I'm saying that I would like you
and your new buddy out of my house.

323
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,550
Oh, yeah.
Well, sure.

324
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:43,224
It was absolutely a pleasure
to meet you, Karen.

325
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:58,834
I guess in your line ofwork
there's times you have to get rough.

326
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:01,807
You know, in case
one ofyour customers don't pay?

327
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:03,675
They always pay.

328
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:06,310
You pack a gun?

329
00:22:06,548 --> 00:22:07,708
Not really.

330
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,811
You ever been arrested?

331
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:14,379
I've been picked up for loan-sharking
and racketeering but never convicted.

332
00:22:14,523 --> 00:22:16,218
No, I'm clean, Harry.

333
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,485
Racketeering.

334
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,284
That covers a lot of ground,
doesn't it?

335
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:23,825
Get to the point.
You want me to do something foryou.

336
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:37,234
That's us.

337
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:31,229
Good girl.

338
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:35,667
Don't say nothing.

339
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:38,399
Sit down and act like
you're waiting for somebody to meet you.

340
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:40,805
What the fuckyou talking about?
Ain't nobody know me here.

341
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,140
-Give me the fucking money.
-Sit down.

342
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:46,010
Now, be looking.

343
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:50,947
Man over to your right
in the blue wool shirt. The other way.

344
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:52,179
Derecho.

345
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:56,383
That's a federal officer.
Most likely DEA.

346
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,326
He moves his leg,
you look for the bulge. Sawy bulge?

347
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:03,191
Good.
That's his backup piece.

348
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,532
Try it without looking
right at him. Ifyou can.

349
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:09,161
-What's your name?
-Yayo Portillo.

350
00:24:09,237 --> 00:24:11,501
All right. You know he's there.
Forget about him.

351
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:14,598
I'm gonna get up. Once I'm gone,
sit in the seat I'm in.

352
00:24:14,676 --> 00:24:16,837
You feel something underyour ass.
That's a key...

353
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:19,073
to a locker
where your half million is...

354
00:24:19,147 --> 00:24:21,138
along with some product
we're returning.

355
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:23,241
Powder's been stepped on
so many times, it's baby food.

356
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:25,309
You're supposed to give me
the money yourself!

357
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:27,378
Try to be cool, Yahoo.

358
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:30,518
I told you where it is.

359
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:33,627
Do it how I told you,
and have a safe trip home.

360
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,871
What'd you have for breakfast?

361
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:55,973
How come you weigh so much?

362
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:58,409
Did you have a burrito?

363
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:02,646
Give it to the nice lady.
There you go.

364
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:07,056
Say thankyou.

365
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:08,389
Thankyou.

366
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:14,392
Like fucking clockwork, huh, Bear?

367
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,896
Hi, Bo!

368
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:18,633
Hey, Farrah.
You ready to go for a ride, sweetie?

369
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:21,498
Told you to watch your mouth
around my daughter.

370
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:30,516
These guys, my investors,
they run a limo service.

371
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:34,049
They put some money
in a few of my pictures.

372
00:25:34,122 --> 00:25:36,113
Did okay.
They're happy.

373
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:40,127
This was a few months ago
when I was planning my next picture...

374
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:44,427
about this band of killer circus freaks
leaving bodies in their wake.

375
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:48,629
There's a 700-pound fat lady who has
a way ofseducing guys in her trailer.

376
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:50,193
Harry, look at me.

377
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:53,503
You're trying to tell me you fucked up
without sounding stupid...

378
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:55,236
and that's hard to do.

379
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,369
Let's talk
about where you're at, okay?

380
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:59,846
You blew 200 grand
ofthese limo guys' money...

381
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:03,373
on a football game in Vegas,
and you didn't tell them. Why?

382
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:06,851
They don't seem like they'd take it
with any understanding.

383
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:08,719
They'd break my legs.

384
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,453
You got that on the brain.
Ifyou were so scared, why go to Vegas?

385
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,825
I needed a half-million dollars
to buy a script.

386
00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:16,386
A movie script?

387
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:19,794
Blockbuster but quality.
No mutants or maniacs.

388
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,859
This is going to be
my ''Driving Miss Daisy.''

389
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:28,838
Murray Saffrin, the guy who wrote it,
did all my ''Grotesque'' pictures.

390
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,844
Had it in his drawer
for 20 years.

391
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:34,177
He shows it to me. Says he's got
a major star interested.

392
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:36,240
-Would I produce it?
-Which star?

393
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:39,879
Two-time Academy Award nominee,
Martin Weir.

394
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:42,746
That's Martin Weir.

395
00:26:42,824 --> 00:26:45,588
He played the mob guy
turned snitch in ''Cyclone.''

396
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,321
One of his best parts.

397
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:50,660
His best was when he played the crippled
gay guy that climbed Mount Whitney.

398
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:52,563
''Ride the Clouds.''
Good picture.

399
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:55,831
-That woman. She looks familiar.
-She's a rock star.

400
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:58,269
Every day, same time,
they have breakfast.

401
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,738
He faces west,
so he can see his billboard.

402
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:03,642
She faces east
as an excuse to wear her shades.

403
00:27:03,712 --> 00:27:05,043
Unbelievable.

404
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,471
Anyway,
Murray has this shrink...

405
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:09,540
who happens to be
Martin's personal trainer's shrink.

406
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:11,609
Murray gives the shrink the script.

407
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:15,349
The shrink gives it to the trainer,
who reads it to Martin.

408
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,284
-Martin loves it. He flips.
-What's the problem?

409
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,022
The problem is Murray.
Heart attack.

410
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:23,220
Doris, Murray's widow...

411
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:27,132
finds out about the Martin Weir thing,
and as Murray and I had no contract...

412
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:29,193
she wants halfa million
for the script.

413
00:27:29,504 --> 00:27:32,200
So you want me to put you
with my dry cleaner...

414
00:27:32,274 --> 00:27:34,105
so he can invest in your movie?

415
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:36,167
That, or what if
some tragic accident...

416
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:38,469
were to befall the Widow Saffrin?

417
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:41,575
I'm not going to pop her, okay?

418
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,741
It wasjust a thought.

419
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:48,187
I'll meet with these limo guys-- tell
them to leave you alone for a while.

420
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:50,190
Make the point so they understand.

421
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:51,748
You don't know these guys.

422
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:54,351
Believe me, Harry.
I know them better than you do.

423
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:15,805
I once asked a literary agent
what kind ofwriting paid best.

424
00:28:15,884 --> 00:28:17,875
He said, ''Ransom notes.''

425
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:20,177
Ransom notes.

426
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:21,950
Here it is,
''Mr. Lovejoy.''

427
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:32,390
''Lovejoy sits behind the wheel watching
a bar, getting his video camera--''

428
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:33,798
Is he following someone?

429
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:36,032
Read it.
It's a grabber.

430
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:45,943
I thinkyour investors are here.

431
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,375
Oh,Jesus.

432
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,711
All right, this is the plan.

433
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:53,887
I want the limo guys to sit
in the chairs. Got that?

434
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,885
Keep the blinds open.
I want the light in their eyes.

435
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,827
I'll sit at the desk.
Don't introduce me.

436
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:05,161
Just start talking,
and stand behind them as they sit.

437
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:06,564
You understand?

438
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:09,870
They'll be looking at you,
but they don't know who you are.

439
00:29:09,938 --> 00:29:11,929
They'll be saying,
''Who is this guy?''

440
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:14,905
But don't say anything.
Do not tell them who I am.

441
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:16,967
-I gotta say something.
-No, you don't.

442
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:19,403
Don't say more than you have to.

443
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:21,142
Unless it's like...

444
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:23,616
''Glad you assholes stopped by.
Now I can straighten you out.''

445
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:25,346
You're kidding, right?

446
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,253
Just say the movie's been
postponed a year but not why.

447
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:30,883
Whateveryou do, don't mention
''Mr. Lovejoy.'' Got that?

448
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:34,788
Let's go.

449
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:38,697
-Hey, Ronnie.
-Hey, Harry. Hi.

450
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,903
-Bo.
-Wow! What year is it?

451
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:46,099
Did we enter a time warp? I feel
like I'm in Hollywood ofyesteryear.

452
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,202
Have a seat.

453
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:57,342
This is my associate, Chili Palmer.
He'll be working with me.

454
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,011
So there's no misunderstanding...

455
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,783
in spite ofthe rumors
you might have heard...

456
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:04,848
your investment in ''Freaks''
is solid as the day you signed...

457
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:06,518
your participation agreement.

458
00:30:06,594 --> 00:30:08,926
I can hearyou, man,
but where are you?

459
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:10,328
Right here.

460
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:14,032
What I've been wondering is,
''Where's he been?''

461
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,702
Where you been?
We haven't heard from you lately.

462
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:21,208
New York. I was interviewing actors,
scouting locations.

463
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,401
Main thing is ''Freaks'' is going
to be delayed a couple months.

464
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:26,811
-A couple months?
-Yeah.

465
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:30,743
Just a couple months.
We need more...

466
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,980
prep.

467
00:30:33,154 --> 00:30:36,419
Bullshit, man!
We have an agreement with you.

468
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:39,654
We are going to do this picture.

469
00:30:39,728 --> 00:30:41,719
I just have
another project to do first.

470
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:44,424
One I promised this guy foryears.

471
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:46,160
I want to see your books.

472
00:30:46,234 --> 00:30:48,828
Show me a two
with five zeros after it.

473
00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:51,633
In black and white.
I want to see your books.

474
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:53,833
I want to see
your fucking bank statements.

475
00:30:53,908 --> 00:30:55,739
Hey, Ronnie.
Look at me.

476
00:30:56,344 --> 00:30:59,575
You have a piece ofa movie,
not a piece of Harry.

477
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:04,376
If he wants to do another movie
this year, that's how it's gonna be.

478
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:06,943
Excuse me, bro',
but who the fuck are you?

479
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:08,784
I'm telling you how it is.

480
00:31:13,128 --> 00:31:15,460
What is this other movie
you're doing for us?

481
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,192
-Let me show you.
-Let me answer this one.

482
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:21,201
Who am I talking to?
Him oryou?

483
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:22,861
You can talk to me.

484
00:31:22,937 --> 00:31:26,100
That's what I thought.
Let me put it this way.

485
00:31:26,174 --> 00:31:29,666
Outside of ''Freaks,'' it's none
ofyour business what we do.

486
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:34,374
Here it is right here.
This is the project. ''Mr. Lovejoy.''

487
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:37,382
I don't want you to think
I'm putting something over on you.

488
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:40,687
''Mr. Loveboy.''
What is it, a porno flick?

489
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:44,385
It's fluff.
You wouldn't be interested in it.

490
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:47,121
You think we see your movies?
I've seen better film on teeth.

491
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,223
It makes no difference to me
which one our money's in.

492
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:54,129
Take our 20 points
out of ''Freaks''...

493
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:56,295
and put them in this
''Mr. Loverboy.''

494
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:58,731
No, I can't do that.

495
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,630
You're positive?

496
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:04,909
It's a different kind ofdeal.
It's structured.

497
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,977
Okay. Then be good enough
to hand us our money back...

498
00:32:09,784 --> 00:32:13,447
oryou think about us coming in
on this new deal. Let us know.

499
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:16,319
By Friday,
oryou're fucking dead as disco.

500
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:17,824
You hear me?

501
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:21,293
Take your time, Harry.
We're not animals.

502
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:22,852
Are we, Ronnie?

503
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:38,901
What?

504
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,921
What!

505
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,721
Maybe I wasn't clear, but I thought
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

506
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:58,789
I had to tell them something.

507
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:02,965
Never say anything
unless you have to.

508
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:05,628
You asked me to get these guys
offyour back.

509
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:08,437
Next thing I know, you're saying,
''Have a piece of'Mr. Lovejoy.'''

510
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,307
I couldn't believe my ears.

511
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:12,209
I told them I'd think about it.

512
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,771
In this town, what does that mean?
Nothing.

513
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:17,147
That's the difference
between you and me, Harry.

514
00:33:17,318 --> 00:33:21,448
I say what I mean. If I want something
from someone, I ask them.

515
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:23,889
If I want Martin Weir,
I go get Martin Weir.

516
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,483
I don't fuck around
with his trainer's shrink.

517
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:27,653
Shrink's trainer.

518
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:29,660
Take me back to my car.

519
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:46,011
- Tommo? Chili.
- Whereyou been?

520
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:48,242
lbeen calling
alloverforyou.

521
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,612
RayBones is looking foryou.
Where the hellareyou?

522
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:54,177
-I'm in L.A. now.
-What are you doing out there?

523
00:33:54,255 --> 00:33:57,190
Going into the movie business.
I'm thinking about producing.

524
00:33:57,258 --> 00:33:59,283
What the fuck do you know
about making movies?

525
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,351
I don't think
the producer has to know much.

526
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:04,694
lthinkyou're fullofshit.

527
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:05,992
I gotta go.

528
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:08,194
Callme whenyou knowmore
about RayBones.

529
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:10,737
-Hey, Chili--
-Karen, how you doing?

530
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:12,636
What are you doing here?

531
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:16,837
I wanted to apologize
for breaking in last night.

532
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:18,639
Let me get this straight.

533
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:21,375
You broke in again to apologize
for breaking in before?

534
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:23,440
Your patio door was open.

535
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:26,214
You shouldn't do that.
You got nice things in here.

536
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:28,945
Make sure you lock it
on the way out.

537
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:30,788
Bad day?

538
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:32,849
I spent all day
crawling out ofa grave.

539
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:34,918
The director said
I was incapable of reaching...

540
00:34:34,996 --> 00:34:36,987
the emotional core
ofthe character.

541
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:40,296
What? Obviously he didn't
see you in ''Bride ofthe Mutant.''

542
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:42,793
You saw that?

543
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:45,130
When you turn to the camera...

544
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,905
and say to the alien mother
that her time on Earth is finished...

545
00:34:48,977 --> 00:34:52,242
Joan Crawford, on her best day,
wished that she had had...

546
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:55,473
in her day, the intensity you
had in that scene.

547
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,813
That was a good scene.
I mean, for a horror movie.

548
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:01,148
For any movie.

549
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:03,416
I'm better than
what I've been doing...

550
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:07,154
wearing fuck-me pumps and a tank top,
waiting 'til it was time to scream.

551
00:35:07,228 --> 00:35:08,559
But what a scream.

552
00:35:09,263 --> 00:35:10,753
It's a real gift.

553
00:35:10,932 --> 00:35:14,925
All I'm saying is it'd be nice to get
the chance to say one great line.

554
00:35:15,003 --> 00:35:17,904
Like in that great Bette Davis movie,
''Cabin in the Cotton''...

555
00:35:17,972 --> 00:35:20,497
where she walks up to the guy,
gives him a look...

556
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:23,043
and says, ''I'd kiss you,
but I just washed my hair.''

557
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:24,271
Great line.

558
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:26,609
How come you don't do movies
with Harry anymore?

559
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:30,349
Because I married the great Martin Weir.
He was a full-timejob.

560
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:33,182
Have you read Harry's new script?

561
00:35:33,688 --> 00:35:36,122
He says it's the best thing
he's ever read.

562
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,622
He must mean
after ''Slime Creatures III.''

563
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,451
Was that why Harry
came over last night?

564
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:44,225
To askyou to help him
put Martin in a movie?

565
00:35:44,532 --> 00:35:46,762
Harry's dreaming ofa $40 million
production...

566
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,631
he'll never get offthe ground...

567
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:51,729
with a star he'll never sign,
with or without my help.

568
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:53,899
He said Martin flipped over it.

569
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:55,966
Martin's known for his flipping.

570
00:35:56,144 --> 00:36:00,046
He flips over a script,
then before the deal, he flips out.

571
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:03,384
Why don't I go to Harry's office
and get a copy ofthe script?

572
00:36:03,484 --> 00:36:05,714
Read it yourself.
See what you think.

573
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,653
Don't go out ofyour way.

574
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,380
No, it's nothing.

575
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:13,820
I better go talk to Leo,
my runaway dry cleaner.

576
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,386
Right.
See how your story ends.

577
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:19,660
That movie, ''Touch of Evil,''
is playing near my hotel.

578
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:23,795
We could check it out ifyou want.
Watch Charlton Heston be a Mexican.

579
00:36:26,007 --> 00:36:27,907
That's all right.
Another time.

580
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:31,475
See you around.

581
00:36:34,348 --> 00:36:35,679
See you.

582
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:03,037
My name is Ray.
I'm a friend of Chili Palmer's.

583
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:06,373
Have you spoken with Mr. Palmer
since your husband blew up?

584
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:09,274
Once or twice.

585
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,181
What was it you talked about?

586
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:13,220
Nothing, really.
This and that.

587
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:14,718
This and that?

588
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:22,793
I really want us to be friends.

589
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:27,628
And we know that friends don't
hit each other unless they have to.

590
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:29,895
Let's start all over again...

591
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:33,973
and you tell me
exactly what the fuck is going on.

592
00:37:35,743 --> 00:37:37,074
Okay?

593
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:43,806
Good evening, sir.

594
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:46,419
And a very good evening
to you, too, sir.

595
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:47,818
Thankyou.

596
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:11,538
Leo.

597
00:38:12,513 --> 00:38:14,003
Look at me.

598
00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:19,276
I never thought
you'd be so dumb.

599
00:38:19,353 --> 00:38:22,618
Leaving over 300 grand
in the closet under a blanket.

600
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,658
But I guess you are.

601
00:38:24,725 --> 00:38:26,693
I didn't know
where else to keep it.

602
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:29,220
Where would you?

603
00:38:29,297 --> 00:38:30,958
How about a bank?

604
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:32,863
They'd report it to the IRS.

605
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:35,869
Don't open an account.
Put in it a safe-deposit box.

606
00:38:35,937 --> 00:38:37,768
You dip in it
wheneveryou want.

607
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,636
How'd you know I was here?

608
00:38:39,707 --> 00:38:41,038
Here's another tip.

609
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:43,668
Next time you write your wife,
don't use hotel stationery.

610
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:48,647
Fay told you about the money?
She tell you my whole life story?

611
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,313
I'm here to save your ass.

612
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:53,887
How? By taking my money?

613
00:38:54,021 --> 00:38:56,114
The money you won today
is yours.

614
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,953
It's all mine!

615
00:38:58,059 --> 00:38:59,720
Leo, sit down.

616
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,722
I don't know how you got this far.
You're so fucking dumb.

617
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,058
You're through.
I'm gonna explain why.

618
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:11,070
I hope you're not so dumb
that you won't understand.

619
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:13,538
Ray Bones is the man
you're dealing with now.

620
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:16,736
When he finds out what you did,
he'll take everything...

621
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:19,343
including the sporty little hat
you got on your head.

622
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:22,505
Most likely he'll shoot you,
so you won't tell on him.

623
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:26,081
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

624
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:28,745
You've got $31 0,000
in the bag here.

625
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:32,988
I'll take the 300 you scammed from
the airlines, and the 1 0 leftover...

626
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,722
I'll borrow from you
and pay back at another time.

627
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,124
Wait.

628
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:40,361
You take all my money,
but you're borrowing part of it?

629
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:44,698
At 1 8%. Now, don't ask another
fucking question. I'm leaving now.

630
00:39:47,608 --> 00:39:51,044
You won't know where I am!
I don't even know where I'll be!

631
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:54,773
I'll find you, Leo. You leave
a trail like a fucking caterpillar.

632
00:39:59,754 --> 00:40:03,554
Wait a minute.
What's this 1 8%-a-year shit?

633
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:06,454
You want to borrow 1 0,
the vig is 3 bills a week.

634
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:09,790
That's 1 5 for the vig plus the 1 0.
That's 25 big ones!

635
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:11,855
You go the whole year, buddy!

636
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:14,157
You hear me!

637
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,261
This is good.

638
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:53,168
This ''Mr. Lovejoy.''

639
00:40:53,374 --> 00:40:57,708
It needs a better ending, but yes,
I can see why Harry wants to do it.

640
00:40:58,946 --> 00:41:03,349
You understand. I knew Harry was lying,
saying this wasn't any good...

641
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:08,113
but holding on to it like you'd have
to break his fingers to get it from him.

642
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:09,520
That's funny.

643
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,753
I was thinking what I'll have
to break to get it away from you.

644
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:15,819
I'm explaining to you what
I'm doing here in case you thought...

645
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:20,799
I came to rip offany ofthis
dusty old shit that the man has.

646
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:23,870
I wouldn't make you out to be a burglar.
Not in that outfit.

647
00:41:24,038 --> 00:41:26,973
Harry called you his associate.
What does that mean?

648
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:31,544
I never heard your name or read it in
the ''Hollywood Reporter'' or ''Variety.''

649
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,579
What he said.
I'm his associate.

650
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:35,638
You must bring
something heavy to the deal.

651
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:37,206
I do. Me.

652
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:41,415
It says here you're getting
Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy?

653
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:42,979
That's right. Martin.

654
00:41:43,057 --> 00:41:45,651
Come on.
How you gonna do that?

655
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:48,320
I'm gonna put a gun
to his head and say...

656
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:50,728
''Sign the fucking papers, Martin,
oryou're dead.''

657
00:41:50,998 --> 00:41:52,329
That's it.

658
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,231
I wonder, would that work?

659
00:41:54,735 --> 00:41:56,930
You know who I see
for the part ofAl Roxy?

660
00:41:57,004 --> 00:41:59,165
Harvey Keitel.
Man could play it in his sleep.

661
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,401
He was pretty good
in the movie ''Fingers.''

662
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:02,635
Missed it.

663
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:05,437
You know who else?
Morgan Freeman. You know his work?

664
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:09,346
Morgan Freeman, yeah.
But he's a colored guy.

665
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,012
So what?

666
00:42:11,185 --> 00:42:13,847
Where's it say in the script
the man's got to be white?

667
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:17,220
Color's what the part needs, man.
Somebody to do it with some style.

668
00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:20,850
What do you think ofthe script?

669
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:28,365
First thing that's got
to go is the title.

670
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:31,702
The writer's name, Murray Saffrin,
would be better than Lovejoy.

671
00:42:31,872 --> 00:42:33,601
I'm with you on that one.

672
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:36,271
You know what I'm thinking?

673
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:40,036
Why don't you and I
rewrite the script where it needs it?

674
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:41,445
You could write one?

675
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:43,005
There's nothing to it.

676
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:46,281
All you do, you get an idea.
Set down what you want to say on paper.

677
00:42:46,353 --> 00:42:49,345
Then you hire someone else
to fill in the commas and shit...

678
00:42:49,423 --> 00:42:51,584
where they belong,
ifyou're not positive yourself.

679
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:54,321
Maybe fix up the spelling
where you have some tricky words.

680
00:42:54,395 --> 00:42:57,387
Although I've seen some scripts
I know the words weren't spelled right.

681
00:42:57,465 --> 00:43:01,731
There were hardly any commas at all,
so I don't think that's too important.

682
00:43:01,902 --> 00:43:06,066
You get to the end.
You write in, ''Fade out.'' You're done.

683
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,370
That's it?
That's all there is?

684
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:12,702
Then what the fuck
do I need you for?

685
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:17,116
Because I'm offering
my services on this one.

686
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:18,674
Tell you what.

687
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,743
If I need a ride sometime...

688
00:43:21,255 --> 00:43:22,745
I'll let you know.

689
00:43:27,394 --> 00:43:30,386
Howcouldyou arrest me here?
This is mycountry.

690
00:43:31,165 --> 00:43:33,656
This is whereyou'regoing to die.

691
00:43:37,605 --> 00:43:40,073
That wasno misfire!
That was to turnyou around...

692
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:42,298
'cause ldon't want
to shootyou in the back...

693
00:43:42,776 --> 00:43:45,404
unlessyou'drather
tryto run from me.

694
00:43:50,851 --> 00:43:52,682
ls she there?
Didyou bring my wife?

695
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:55,085
She's in the car.
They'vegot it allon tape.

696
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:57,813
- Yousureyougot enough?
-Play it back. You'llsee.

697
00:43:59,627 --> 00:44:01,117
Howmany didyou frame?

698
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:03,789
- You bettergive me thatgun.
-Okay, here it is.

699
00:44:05,799 --> 00:44:07,790
That's the second bullet
I've stopped foryou.

700
00:44:07,868 --> 00:44:10,860
That's thesecondbullet
l'vestoppedforyou.

701
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,540
You're going down, Orson.

702
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:24,944
lsn 'tsomebodygoing to come
andtake him away?

703
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:28,720
ln a fewminutes.
You really likedhim, didn 'tyou?

704
00:44:28,889 --> 00:44:30,220
The cop did.

705
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:33,226
The cop did.
The one who killedhim.

706
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:35,285
-He loved him.
-He lovedhim.

707
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:37,520
He wasagreat detective.

708
00:44:37,598 --> 00:44:39,896
-But a lousy cop.
-Anda lousycop.

709
00:44:41,001 --> 00:44:42,992
ls that allyou have
to say forhim?

710
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:46,506
He wassome kindofa man.

711
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,343
What does it matter
whatyousayaboutpeople?

712
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:03,720
-Good-bye, Tanya.
-Adios.

713
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:05,952
Adios.

714
00:45:21,709 --> 00:45:23,370
You've been here the whole time?

715
00:45:23,444 --> 00:45:25,173
I just caught the end.

716
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:27,976
Welles didn't even want
to do this movie.

717
00:45:28,048 --> 00:45:30,778
He had some studio contract
he couldn't get out of.

718
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:34,452
Sometimes you do your best work
when you got a gun to your head.

719
00:45:37,057 --> 00:45:38,547
I brought the script.

720
00:45:38,626 --> 00:45:40,287
Harry left a copy at my house.

721
00:45:40,594 --> 00:45:42,824
-How'd you like it?
-It's not horrible.

722
00:45:42,896 --> 00:45:45,626
I don't like the title,
and I don't like some characters.

723
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:48,497
-So you read it?
-Not yet, but I will.

724
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:51,538
-You and Harry make a great team.
-Is that right?

725
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:54,665
-I'll make a deal with him.
-You found a role you like?

726
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:56,733
I don't want to act in it.
I want to produce it.

727
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:59,802
-Especially if I help get Martin.
-That's fair.

728
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:02,747
Yeah.
So, what do you get out of it?

729
00:46:02,816 --> 00:46:05,216
Is that why you came?
To ask me that?

730
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:06,981
I want to know.

731
00:46:07,054 --> 00:46:09,215
Why would anyone want
to be in the movies?

732
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,622
Yesterday you were a loan shark.

733
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:13,750
Yeah, but I was never
that into it.

734
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:16,322
Especially this bullshit
about having respect.

735
00:46:16,497 --> 00:46:19,762
It's bad enough treating these guys
like they're your heroes.

736
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:22,766
Smiling at stupid comments
they think are so funny.

737
00:46:22,936 --> 00:46:25,666
You think the movie business
is any different?

738
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,229
Yeah, but I like movies.

739
00:46:27,308 --> 00:46:30,004
If I help Harry,
I'll find out what to do...

740
00:46:30,177 --> 00:46:32,611
outside of raising money
and having an idea.

741
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,671
That doesn't sound so hard.

742
00:46:34,782 --> 00:46:38,616
I was in the money business, and I have
a lot of ideas floating in my head.

743
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:41,145
Listen, I'm going to talk
to Martin tomorrow morning.

744
00:46:41,388 --> 00:46:44,824
I told Harry I'd meet you and him
at the Abiquiu restaurant afterwards.

745
00:46:47,361 --> 00:46:49,693
Thisjust might work out.

746
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:51,628
You never know.

747
00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:53,460
Itjust might.

748
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,760
Adios.

749
00:47:51,925 --> 00:47:55,190
I spent eight hours at the airport
looking at people's bulges.

750
00:47:55,262 --> 00:47:56,627
I don't like that.

751
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:58,528
This is not the way
we do business.

752
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:00,533
You do not know
who you are messing with.

753
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:03,263
I don't want no fucking key.
I want the money.

754
00:48:03,337 --> 00:48:08,604
Yayo! You gonna smoke,
get the hell off my $70-a-yard carpet.

755
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:13,205
I told you where the money is.
All you got to do is go and get it.

756
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,710
No!
Now I tell you something.

757
00:48:15,949 --> 00:48:18,975
I go to the airport,
open that locker and they bust me?

758
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:22,021
I tell them I come to get something
foryou. That's all I know.

759
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:24,387
-That's all you know?
-That's all I know.

760
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:27,120
Wait here a minute, Yayo.
I'll be back directly.

761
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:30,653
Keep an eye on Yahoo for me.

762
00:48:42,509 --> 00:48:44,340
That's how you get things done.

763
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,441
What the fuck
you gonna do with that?

764
00:48:51,518 --> 00:48:53,679
I'm taking you out, Yahoo.

765
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:07,992
Did you see that?
The way the man just went right over?

766
00:49:08,068 --> 00:49:10,229
Maybe we could get
Chili Palmer up here?

767
00:49:10,437 --> 00:49:13,463
You could fix my railing
to give way like in the movies.

768
00:49:13,774 --> 00:49:15,935
I invite the man up here
to look at my view.

769
00:49:16,009 --> 00:49:18,000
Get him to lean
over the railing...

770
00:49:18,078 --> 00:49:19,909
Dumbest idea I ever heard.

771
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:23,109
Here's the thing, Bear.

772
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:24,844
I want to produce movies.

773
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:28,046
What's the point of living in L.A.
unless you're in the movie business?

774
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:30,112
And I mean high up in it.

775
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,623
That's why Harry's going
to produce ''Mr. Lovejoy'' with me...

776
00:49:33,694 --> 00:49:35,685
not Chili Palmer.

777
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,641
I can't believe
this map is accurate.

778
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,313
I bought it for ten bucks
from a kid on Sunset.

779
00:50:01,388 --> 00:50:03,379
You were supposed to meet me
at the restaurant.

780
00:50:03,457 --> 00:50:06,949
I know, but look. ''Martin Weir's house
across from George Hamilton.''

781
00:50:07,027 --> 00:50:08,858
-That must be Geo--
-Chili?

782
00:50:08,929 --> 00:50:10,089
Nicole?

783
00:50:10,163 --> 00:50:12,097
Jesus, it is you.
It's Nicki now.

784
00:50:12,165 --> 00:50:14,156
I don't believe this.

785
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,866
This is great.
I know her.

786
00:50:16,937 --> 00:50:18,268
-Hi, Nicki.
-Karen.

787
00:50:18,338 --> 00:50:21,000
Shit, I didn't see you there.
How are you?

788
00:50:21,074 --> 00:50:23,634
Come in, baby. You gotta come in.
You gotta meet Martin.

789
00:50:25,212 --> 00:50:27,544
Where've you been?
What've you been doing?

790
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:32,647
Chili was the only one at Momo's
didn't try to hit on me.

791
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:34,275
What a gentleman.

792
00:50:34,354 --> 00:50:36,345
Do you like my hair?
Black...

793
00:50:36,422 --> 00:50:39,220
Nice, yeah.
Especially under the arms.

794
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:42,588
Martin won't let me shave.
Guess I fill some need.

795
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:45,357
Takes him back to the sixties
or something.

796
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:48,093
Speak ofthe devil.

797
00:50:48,568 --> 00:50:50,661
Karen, look at you.

798
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,172
You smell so good.
She always smells so good.

799
00:50:56,242 --> 00:50:59,234
Neat.
Martin, this is Chili Palmer.

800
00:50:59,479 --> 00:51:01,606
-Chili, is it?
-Nice to meet you, Martin.

801
00:51:01,681 --> 00:51:03,171
Chili's a gangster.

802
00:51:03,249 --> 00:51:06,241
Ran a club I used to play at
for another gangster back in Miami.

803
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,810
-How is Momo these days?
-Dead.

804
00:51:09,088 --> 00:51:10,248
Bummer.

805
00:51:10,323 --> 00:51:12,314
Well, I'll let you get
to your movie talk.

806
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:15,225
Chili, do not leave
without saying good-bye to me.

807
00:51:15,928 --> 00:51:17,259
See you.

808
00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:20,730
So...

809
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:25,129
You know how beautiful you are?

810
00:51:25,204 --> 00:51:27,195
You really are beautiful.

811
00:51:27,373 --> 00:51:28,965
I'm sitting here...

812
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,804
I'm looking at you,
having memories of us.

813
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,643
-Really?
-Yeah.

814
00:51:35,715 --> 00:51:40,379
I'm wondering, how did it go wrong?
How did it all slip away?

815
00:51:40,553 --> 00:51:45,490
It didn't slip away. You did, by going
offto fuck Nicki at my birthday party.

816
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:48,050
Yeah. That was a good party.

817
00:51:48,127 --> 00:51:50,618
Marty, you were so good
in ''The Cyclone.''

818
00:51:50,797 --> 00:51:51,786
Martin.

819
00:51:51,964 --> 00:51:53,625
That was a beautiful role.

820
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,462
All I had to do was find
the character's center...

821
00:51:56,636 --> 00:51:59,901
the stem I used to wind him up,
and he'd play.

822
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:02,735
-He'd just play.
-You had that down cold.

823
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:05,471
If I didn't know better,
I'd have thought you was a made guy.

824
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:07,740
-Thankyou.
-I mean, no acting there.

825
00:52:07,814 --> 00:52:10,044
And the fink part.
Oh, man.Jesus Christ!

826
00:52:10,116 --> 00:52:13,142
I never met a fink,
and I hope I never do...

827
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:16,154
but the way you played a fink,
that's how it's gotta be, right?

828
00:52:16,222 --> 00:52:17,348
Yeah.

829
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,084
Two weeks
before we started shooting...

830
00:52:20,326 --> 00:52:23,090
I went back to Bensonhurst
just to hearyou guys talk.

831
00:52:23,262 --> 00:52:25,822
I'm Italian,
but I grew up in Tarzana.

832
00:52:26,065 --> 00:52:30,399
I wanted to get the rhythms
ofyour speech, you know?

833
00:52:30,603 --> 00:52:32,093
We speak differently?

834
00:52:32,171 --> 00:52:34,605
It's more your attitude.
Your tone.

835
00:52:34,774 --> 00:52:37,504
Your speech patterns show a certain
confidence in yourselves...

836
00:52:37,577 --> 00:52:40,808
in your opinions, your indifference
to conventional views.

837
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,404
It's like--

838
00:52:42,615 --> 00:52:44,105
We don't give a shit.

839
00:52:44,183 --> 00:52:45,673
Kind of, yeah.

840
00:52:46,452 --> 00:52:49,182
Anyway, once I get
the authentic sounds ofspeech...

841
00:52:49,355 --> 00:52:52,518
the rhythms,
the patois, you know...

842
00:52:53,292 --> 00:52:57,626
I can actually get into their heads
and think the way those guys do.

843
00:52:57,797 --> 00:52:59,458
-Really?
-Yeah.

844
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:02,090
I'm one ofthose guys.
What am I thinking?

845
00:53:02,702 --> 00:53:04,795
Don't get me wrong.

846
00:53:05,037 --> 00:53:09,531
An actual metamorphosis doesn't
take place. That wouldn't be acting.

847
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:13,440
-So you don't know what I'm thinking?
-No, but I'm curious.

848
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:15,544
You want to know
what I'm thinking?

849
00:53:15,748 --> 00:53:18,444
-Yeah, ifyou want to tell me.
-I'm thinking about a movie.

850
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:19,811
One of mine?

851
00:53:19,886 --> 00:53:21,979
No, one that we're producing.

852
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:24,555
With what?
Wise guy money?

853
00:53:26,726 --> 00:53:28,717
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

854
00:53:28,895 --> 00:53:32,160
No, no.
I'm not connected to that anymore.

855
00:53:32,265 --> 00:53:34,233
Not since I left
loan-sharking in Miami.

856
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,131
The pressure got too much?

857
00:53:36,235 --> 00:53:38,726
Pressure? I'm the one
who applied the pressure.

858
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:40,363
Oh, yeah?

859
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,635
-Can I ask a question?
-Yeah.

860
00:53:42,742 --> 00:53:44,903
You're an actor.
Actors like to pretend.

861
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:47,402
We've been known to make believe.

862
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,878
Pretend this.
You're a shylock.

863
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:52,907
A guy owes you 1 5 grand,
and he skips town.

864
00:53:52,985 --> 00:53:55,146
He takes off.
What do you do?

865
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:09,828
Oh, Martin,
for chrissake.

866
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,259
Just...

867
00:54:12,438 --> 00:54:13,427
you know.

868
00:54:14,106 --> 00:54:16,540
I'm doing Shylock,
instead ofa shylock.

869
00:54:16,742 --> 00:54:19,040
-Right.
-What's my motivation?

870
00:54:19,312 --> 00:54:21,371
The acquisition of money.
To collect.

871
00:54:21,547 --> 00:54:23,777
To inflict pain if I have to.

872
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,812
Guy splits with 1 5 large
of my money?

873
00:54:27,053 --> 00:54:29,351
I'd go after him!
What the hell you think I'd do?

874
00:54:29,422 --> 00:54:31,913
-Look at me.
-I am looking at you.

875
00:54:31,991 --> 00:54:33,925
No, look at me
the way I'm looking at you.

876
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:35,517
Put it in your eyes.

877
00:54:35,595 --> 00:54:38,257
''You're mine, asshole.''
Without saying it.

878
00:54:39,465 --> 00:54:40,898
How about this?

879
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:47,062
What are you telling me?
That you're sleepy?

880
00:54:47,139 --> 00:54:48,970
That you want to go to bed?

881
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:50,406
Wait, wait.

882
00:55:00,086 --> 00:55:02,418
Now you're squinting,
like you need glasses.

883
00:55:03,456 --> 00:55:05,117
What do you--

884
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:07,159
-Look at me.
-What?

885
00:55:07,226 --> 00:55:09,694
What I'm thinking is,
''You're mine.''

886
00:55:09,762 --> 00:55:11,252
''I fucking own you.''

887
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:13,924
What I'm not doing is feeling
one way or another about it.

888
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:16,894
You see,
you're not a person to me.

889
00:55:16,969 --> 00:55:19,529
You're an entry in my book.
A guy who owes me money.

890
00:55:20,706 --> 00:55:23,197
All right.
How about this?

891
00:55:28,848 --> 00:55:30,839
Not bad.
Not bad.

892
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:33,945
-No wonderyou're Martin Weir.
-Oh, yeah.

893
00:55:34,654 --> 00:55:36,849
That's what I think ofyou, asshole.

894
00:55:36,923 --> 00:55:38,254
Nothing.

895
00:55:38,758 --> 00:55:40,749
I believe it.
I believe it.

896
00:55:41,294 --> 00:55:43,524
I turn this on
when I confront the guy?

897
00:55:43,663 --> 00:55:46,655
You haven't found him yet
because he split for Las Vegas.

898
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,791
-How do I know that?
-His wife told you.

899
00:55:49,969 --> 00:55:51,960
His wife told me.
Okay.

900
00:56:00,379 --> 00:56:02,313
Harry, how you doing?

901
00:56:02,381 --> 00:56:04,212
Oh, hi.
Great.

902
00:56:05,718 --> 00:56:07,811
I'm expecting some people.

903
00:56:07,987 --> 00:56:11,252
You must be doing some big deals,
doing lunch in a place like this.

904
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:13,315
I'm working on a few things.

905
00:56:13,426 --> 00:56:15,826
I hearyou bagged
Martin Weir for ''Mr. Lovejoy.''

906
00:56:16,362 --> 00:56:18,489
This town.
Word gets around, doesn't it?

907
00:56:18,664 --> 00:56:20,325
Chili Palmer told me.

908
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:24,125
Last night, when he called me
over to your office to talk about it.

909
00:56:24,236 --> 00:56:26,227
Chili Palmer
showed you my script?

910
00:56:26,672 --> 00:56:28,902
Yeah.
I was wondering why he'd do that.

911
00:56:30,443 --> 00:56:34,174
So the wife sues the airline.
This is some gutsy babe.

912
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:36,508
Good-looking too.
Like Karen.

913
00:56:36,616 --> 00:56:39,107
When do I meet up with the husband
and give him the look?

914
00:56:39,185 --> 00:56:41,176
That's not so simple.

915
00:56:41,253 --> 00:56:43,915
There's a mob guy. Real hard-on.
You owe him money.

916
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,517
He wants to take you out
because you broke his nose and shot him.

917
00:56:47,693 --> 00:56:49,991
Right, right.
Go ahead. Keep going.

918
00:56:50,262 --> 00:56:53,925
At this point,
basically that's got to be it.

919
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,831
That's all you'll tell me?

920
00:56:55,901 --> 00:56:57,892
Actually, Martin,
the reason we came by...

921
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,870
was to talk about ''Mr. Lovejoy.''

922
00:56:59,939 --> 00:57:02,931
We understand you read the script.
You loved it. You flipped.

923
00:57:03,943 --> 00:57:05,638
Refresh my memory.

924
00:57:05,711 --> 00:57:09,807
Listen, Harry. How'd you like
to get your hands on $500,000?

925
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:12,350
You pay me back at your convenience
with no interest.

926
00:57:12,418 --> 00:57:14,045
Are you serious?

927
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,884
All I want in return is to work
on this movie with you.

928
00:57:17,123 --> 00:57:21,059
I've already got some strong ideas
on how to fix it up.

929
00:57:21,227 --> 00:57:23,286
Gentlemen,
can I get you anything else?

930
00:57:23,729 --> 00:57:26,061
Let's get another for Mr. Zimm.
A double.

931
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:32,196
You'rejust going to give me
500 grand?

932
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:34,466
We'll talk about that,
but first I gotta know...

933
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,831
how'd you hook up
with Chili Palmer?

934
00:57:39,245 --> 00:57:42,737
''Mr. Lovejoy'' was good.
I'll call Buddy and set up a meeting.

935
00:57:42,815 --> 00:57:44,840
-Who's Buddy?
-Lufkin, his agent.

936
00:57:44,917 --> 00:57:46,908
-Karen knows him.
-But you are interested?

937
00:57:46,986 --> 00:57:48,977
I'm intrigued.
You know what might help?

938
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,886
Another look at ''The Cyclone.''

939
00:57:50,956 --> 00:57:52,947
The way a visual fabric
is maintained...

940
00:57:53,025 --> 00:57:55,220
while the metaphor plays
on different levels.

941
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,391
Hey, Chili,
is this your ride?

942
00:57:59,465 --> 00:58:01,933
I like to sit up high.
Check everything out.

943
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:04,595
It is the Cadillac of minivans.

944
00:58:05,071 --> 00:58:06,561
Check this out.

945
00:58:11,177 --> 00:58:13,270
Mind if I take it for a spin?

946
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:26,118
He was watching Letterman?
Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.

947
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:29,025
Did he find the dry cleaner,
the one with all that money?

948
00:58:29,128 --> 00:58:31,187
Leo?
I don't know.

949
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:36,297
I bet he did, but he ain't giving
one penny of it to help you out.

950
00:58:36,435 --> 00:58:38,096
Not the way I am.

951
00:58:38,804 --> 00:58:42,900
Assuming I go along with this,
when could I have the 500 grand?

952
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:44,306
Wheneveryou want.

953
00:58:44,376 --> 00:58:47,812
The money's in a jock bag
in $1 00 bills out at the airport...

954
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,871
just waiting in a locker
to be picked up.

955
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:51,439
At the airport?

956
00:58:55,121 --> 00:58:58,716
It was waiting on a deal
that didn't go through.

957
00:58:59,024 --> 00:59:00,616
You don't want to know.

958
00:59:00,993 --> 00:59:02,824
I don't know...

959
00:59:02,995 --> 00:59:05,327
It's not the kind ofthing you do,
so I'm thinking.

960
00:59:05,397 --> 00:59:07,888
Why not send your boy,
Chili Palmer?

961
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:11,491
If he gets busted, hit on the head,
you aren't out a thing.

962
00:59:13,439 --> 00:59:14,929
C-1 8.

963
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:16,672
Magic number.

964
00:59:22,748 --> 00:59:25,581
I'm positive.
It was Susan Hayward.

965
00:59:25,751 --> 00:59:29,016
No, it was Rita Hayworth
and Glenn Ford.

966
00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:32,254
Excuse me, Harry.

967
00:59:32,992 --> 00:59:34,323
Wait here.

968
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:46,260
I'd like you to meet
my associate, Bear.

969
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:50,534
Movie stuntman, champion weight lifter,
as you may have noticed.

970
00:59:50,643 --> 00:59:52,634
Throws things out
I don't want.

971
00:59:53,379 --> 00:59:55,540
You ought to turn around
and go back to Miami.

972
00:59:55,614 --> 00:59:57,275
You're a stuntman?

973
00:59:57,917 --> 01:00:00,385
-Any good?
-Am I good?

974
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:10,552
That's not bad
for a guy his size.

975
01:00:12,698 --> 01:00:14,359
I'll make you a deal.

976
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:16,697
Ifyou can get out of here
before I take my coat off...

977
01:00:16,769 --> 01:00:19,966
I won't clean up the floor with you
and mess up your pretty costume.

978
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,165
You don't know me.

979
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:25,301
You only thinkyou do.

980
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:38,420
That guy is a stuntman.

981
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:39,514
Yeah, he was in ''Creatures II.''

982
01:00:48,701 --> 01:00:50,532
Rough business
this movie business.

983
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:53,595
I may have to go back
to loan-sharking to take a rest.

984
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:56,030
What're you still doing
with those guys?

985
01:00:56,275 --> 01:00:59,767
He happens to be loaning me $500,000.
No strings.

986
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:02,345
I can write any kind
ofagreement I want.

987
01:01:02,448 --> 01:01:04,439
-Cash or check?
-Cash.

988
01:01:04,516 --> 01:01:07,974
It happens to be sitting at the airport
in a locker at this moment.

989
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,386
A locker at the airport.Jesus Christ,
tell me you're not really that stupid.

990
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:13,948
You're being set up.

991
01:01:14,026 --> 01:01:16,358
You cancelled that ''Freaks'' deal.
He's paying you back.

992
01:01:16,428 --> 01:01:18,589
Is that right?
He's setting me up?

993
01:01:18,697 --> 01:01:21,996
Why did Catlett say I should send you
to the airport to pick it up?

994
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:25,061
You haven't done a thing for me
since you got involved...

995
01:01:25,137 --> 01:01:27,128
except show Bo Catlett my script.

996
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,132
You're right.
You're not the one being set up.

997
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:33,337
At least Bo has invested
in three of my movies.

998
01:01:33,412 --> 01:01:35,073
We spoke with Martin.

999
01:01:35,147 --> 01:01:36,307
We?

1000
01:01:36,382 --> 01:01:37,747
-Chili and me.
-Really?

1001
01:01:37,816 --> 01:01:40,307
He asked us to call Buddy,
set up a meeting.

1002
01:01:40,386 --> 01:01:42,650
A meeting.
You and Karen?

1003
01:01:43,555 --> 01:01:45,546
Guy's been in town two days...

1004
01:01:45,624 --> 01:01:47,990
and already he thinks
he's David O. fucking Selznick.

1005
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,824
Okay, Mr. O. Selznick,
should I make my deal with Bo...

1006
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,297
or are you going to talk
to your dry cleaner, ifyou find him?

1007
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:57,233
I found him,
but forget about Leo's money.

1008
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,201
Do you have it?

1009
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:02,399
If I gave you Leo's money,
you'd have Ray Bones all overyour ass.

1010
01:02:02,474 --> 01:02:04,635
-That's a new kind oftrouble.
-Who?

1011
01:02:04,843 --> 01:02:08,335
Ray Barboni. He lives in Miami.
He owns Leo now that Momo's dead.

1012
01:02:08,614 --> 01:02:11,549
Who the fuck is Momo?
Where do you get these names?

1013
01:02:11,617 --> 01:02:13,278
I tell you what I'll do foryou.

1014
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:15,650
I'll go to the airport
tomorrow morning when it's crowded.

1015
01:02:15,721 --> 01:02:18,315
I'll check it out. Ifthere's
no problem, I'll get the money.

1016
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,415
But don't get your hopes up.

1017
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:22,517
Maybe I should call
this Ray Barboni character...

1018
01:02:22,594 --> 01:02:24,585
and see if he wants
to invest in my movie?

1019
01:02:25,197 --> 01:02:27,665
Don't waste your time.
He's not a movie fan.

1020
01:02:27,866 --> 01:02:29,026
Give me the key.

1021
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:38,937
Tell him he's gotta be out there
by 5:00 in the morning.

1022
01:02:40,045 --> 01:02:42,946
Because the actor will
only work one night, that's why.

1023
01:02:43,215 --> 01:02:44,705
I gotta go.

1024
01:02:48,854 --> 01:02:50,185
Coming!

1025
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:54,552
-Who is it?
-Me.

1026
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:56,218
Oh, fuck.

1027
01:02:56,628 --> 01:02:58,118
I heard that.

1028
01:02:59,064 --> 01:03:00,463
Hello, Doris.

1029
01:03:00,632 --> 01:03:02,122
Harry Zimm.

1030
01:03:02,301 --> 01:03:04,735
You look like a wet kiss.

1031
01:03:08,574 --> 01:03:11,475
Aren't you going to offer me
whatever it is you taste like?

1032
01:03:12,244 --> 01:03:13,575
Come in, Doris.

1033
01:03:14,146 --> 01:03:15,807
My favorite color...

1034
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:17,141
putty.

1035
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,414
I like it.

1036
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:21,575
What do you want?

1037
01:03:31,263 --> 01:03:33,094
I miss Murray.

1038
01:03:33,165 --> 01:03:35,099
Yeah, I miss him too.

1039
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,158
A hell ofa good writer.

1040
01:03:37,336 --> 01:03:40,271
I should know. I discovered him,
made him what he was.

1041
01:03:40,439 --> 01:03:42,771
What he was was a hack.

1042
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:45,237
He couldn't get a job writing
for anyone but you.

1043
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:47,835
I'm being honest.

1044
01:03:47,946 --> 01:03:49,937
He was a lousy writer
but a good husband.

1045
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:52,407
I just didn't know
until it was too late.

1046
01:03:52,518 --> 01:03:56,010
20/20 hindsight and all that.
You know what they say.

1047
01:03:56,522 --> 01:03:58,353
I hate being alone.

1048
01:03:58,624 --> 01:04:00,785
The house is so quiet.

1049
01:04:00,959 --> 01:04:02,290
So lonely.

1050
01:04:03,762 --> 01:04:05,093
It needs...

1051
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:07,965
a man's touch.

1052
01:04:09,635 --> 01:04:11,535
Nice necklace, Doris.

1053
01:04:20,145 --> 01:04:22,545
I don't know
how I feel about this.

1054
01:04:23,048 --> 01:04:25,482
You seem to feel fine about it.

1055
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:29,549
I mean morally.
You know, Murray was a friend.

1056
01:04:29,721 --> 01:04:31,211
Murray's dead.

1057
01:04:34,726 --> 01:04:36,887
Does this mean that...

1058
01:04:37,062 --> 01:04:39,724
you'll reconsider our deal
on ''Mr. Lovejoy''?

1059
01:04:39,865 --> 01:04:41,594
No, but now that
you mention it...

1060
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:44,602
I did talk to a gorgeous
young executive at Paramount...

1061
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,400
whojust happened
to get his hands on the script.

1062
01:04:47,473 --> 01:04:48,633
What'd he say?

1063
01:04:48,707 --> 01:04:51,835
If Martin's interested,
I can get halfa million for it, easy.

1064
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:55,670
Don't worry, Harry.

1065
01:04:55,848 --> 01:04:58,339
I'm still giving you until Friday.

1066
01:04:58,517 --> 01:05:00,075
How honorable ofyou.

1067
01:05:01,753 --> 01:05:03,084
You want me to go?

1068
01:05:03,922 --> 01:05:05,583
Just say so.

1069
01:05:09,027 --> 01:05:10,517
What the hell.

1070
01:05:19,171 --> 01:05:20,331
Fuck.

1071
01:05:23,775 --> 01:05:25,834
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1072
01:05:31,717 --> 01:05:32,877
What?

1073
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:34,111
Ray Barboni?

1074
01:05:34,253 --> 01:05:35,584
Who is this?

1075
01:05:35,687 --> 01:05:37,780
ls this theguy
theycallRayBones?

1076
01:05:37,956 --> 01:05:39,947
It depends.
Who is this?

1077
01:05:40,025 --> 01:05:41,185
Who is this?

1078
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:44,190
This is the one telling you
the way it is.

1079
01:05:44,363 --> 01:05:48,129
Okay, asshole?
You want your 300 grand, or don't you?

1080
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,191
What 300 grand
are you talking about?

1081
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:54,203
The 300 grand a guy named Leo Devoe
scammed offan airline.

1082
01:05:54,373 --> 01:05:58,639
The 300 grand Chili Palmer
now has in his possession.

1083
01:06:00,379 --> 01:06:01,539
Hello?

1084
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,011
Are you there?

1085
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:05,879
I'm here.
I just don't like this anonymous crap.

1086
01:06:06,051 --> 01:06:09,316
Eitheryou're a big chickenshit,
oryou're not for real.

1087
01:06:09,488 --> 01:06:11,649
Trust me.
I am very for real.

1088
01:06:11,723 --> 01:06:13,384
Then who are you?

1089
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:16,084
lhappen to work forHarryZimm, okay?

1090
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:17,150
Who?

1091
01:06:17,229 --> 01:06:20,824
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be
a major Hollywood player.

1092
01:06:20,899 --> 01:06:22,389
Never heard of him.

1093
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:25,334
Maybe because you've never been
out offucking Miami, dipshit.

1094
01:06:25,504 --> 01:06:30,168
Maybe you should get on a plane, come
to L.A., take a meeting with Mr. Zimm.

1095
01:06:30,676 --> 01:06:34,271
So this Zimm guy,
is he asking for a finder's fee?

1096
01:06:34,413 --> 01:06:36,404
Is that
what we're talking about?

1097
01:06:36,748 --> 01:06:38,909
Zimm don't ask for dick.

1098
01:06:39,084 --> 01:06:41,416
Zimm tells you the way it is,
or else.

1099
01:06:43,488 --> 01:06:44,819
Or else what?

1100
01:06:44,923 --> 01:06:47,585
Orelse
useyourfucking imagination!

1101
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:09,330
Excuse me.
Can you help me out?

1102
01:08:09,408 --> 01:08:11,205
I have a gift
in here for my wife.

1103
01:08:11,276 --> 01:08:15,940
It's a surprise, and I was wondering
ifyou could put this in locker C-1 7.

1104
01:08:16,281 --> 01:08:18,841
Ten bucks.
Take you two minutes.

1105
01:08:19,117 --> 01:08:20,516
Yeah, okay.

1106
01:08:21,286 --> 01:08:23,117
You'll need some ofthis.

1107
01:08:24,122 --> 01:08:26,352
Make it quick.
She's in thejohn.

1108
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:28,854
C-1 7.

1109
01:08:46,712 --> 01:08:47,872
Good man.

1110
01:09:49,474 --> 01:09:50,964
Let's go, boys.

1111
01:09:54,379 --> 01:09:55,869
Excuse me, sir.

1112
01:09:55,947 --> 01:09:57,778
Agent Curtis,
Drug Enforcement.

1113
01:09:57,849 --> 01:10:01,182
These are Agents Dunbar and Morgan.
Would you come with us, please?

1114
01:10:01,286 --> 01:10:02,719
What's going on?

1115
01:10:02,788 --> 01:10:05,120
Let's follow him
and behave ourselves.

1116
01:10:12,397 --> 01:10:14,228
Mr. Barbone?
Welcome to L.A.

1117
01:10:14,299 --> 01:10:16,358
I'm Bobby, your driver.
Did you have a good flight?

1118
01:10:16,435 --> 01:10:19,165
Yeah, but I hope you drive better
than you fucking spell, jack-off.

1119
01:10:19,237 --> 01:10:21,899
The name is Barboni
not Barbone, okay?

1120
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:24,632
Want to go to the hotel first,
Mr. Escobar?

1121
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:26,904
I want to get my fucking money.

1122
01:10:29,614 --> 01:10:29,648
[ Skipped item nr. 1122 ]

1123
01:10:29,648 --> 01:10:31,513
-You live in Miami?
-That's right.

1124
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:33,073
Why are you in Los Angeles?

1125
01:10:33,151 --> 01:10:35,142
-I'm in movies.
-You're an investor?

1126
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,245
-No, I'm a producer.
-Got a card in this?

1127
01:10:37,322 --> 01:10:41,019
Not yet, I just got started.
I'd like to know what this is all about.

1128
01:10:41,092 --> 01:10:43,754
I got a search warrant
says I can strip-search you.

1129
01:10:43,995 --> 01:10:45,326
Pat him down.

1130
01:10:45,664 --> 01:10:47,495
Put your hands on the wall.

1131
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,531
Spread your legs.

1132
01:10:49,601 --> 01:10:51,262
What are you doing
at the airport?

1133
01:10:51,336 --> 01:10:54,271
Picking up my wife,
but she wasn't on the plane.

1134
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:57,101
Ifyou live in Miami,
why is your wife coming from Newark?

1135
01:10:57,175 --> 01:11:00,872
We had a fight. She left me.
Went back to Brooklyn.

1136
01:11:00,946 --> 01:11:03,176
I called her and said,
''Why don't you come out west?

1137
01:11:03,248 --> 01:11:05,876
Maybe a change ofscenery
will get us back together.''

1138
01:11:05,951 --> 01:11:09,011
She said okay,
but evidently she changed her mind.

1139
01:11:09,454 --> 01:11:11,149
-Wife a Lakers fan?
-I am.

1140
01:11:11,523 --> 01:11:14,856
I'm a fan ofeverything that's L.A.
I love it out here.

1141
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,491
He's clean.

1142
01:11:18,463 --> 01:11:19,623
You can go.

1143
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:22,564
What are you looking for?

1144
01:11:22,634 --> 01:11:23,965
A bomb?

1145
01:11:24,035 --> 01:11:25,764
Something that shouldn't be here.

1146
01:11:25,837 --> 01:11:27,327
Is that right?

1147
01:11:27,405 --> 01:11:30,374
Get an attendant to open the lockers.
Maybe you'll find it.

1148
01:11:30,675 --> 01:11:32,336
I'll think about it.

1149
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:33,900
I'd do that.

1150
01:11:34,379 --> 01:11:36,210
Then I'd get
the right guy next time.

1151
01:11:46,825 --> 01:11:50,090
You ever want to go to the beach,
here's the freeway you take.

1152
01:11:50,228 --> 01:11:53,425
Ofcourse, on the weekend
there's no traffic.

1153
01:11:53,498 --> 01:11:56,490
I'm from Miami fucking Beach,
and you want to show me the ocean?

1154
01:11:56,568 --> 01:11:59,662
Does the sun ever shine in this town,
or is this smog always around?

1155
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:03,503
They say the smog's the reason
we have such beautiful sunsets.

1156
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:05,670
That's what they say?

1157
01:12:06,411 --> 01:12:09,005
What a bunch offucking bullshit.

1158
01:12:22,661 --> 01:12:25,255
I don't know how I could have
missed you in that shirt.

1159
01:12:25,497 --> 01:12:29,490
The same as the other one except
a different colored hibiscus, right?

1160
01:12:29,601 --> 01:12:31,432
You didn't have the key on you?

1161
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:33,095
You think I'd be standing here?

1162
01:12:33,171 --> 01:12:35,799
Ifyou're gonna set someone up,
and you want it to work...

1163
01:12:35,874 --> 01:12:37,671
it's gotta be a surprise.

1164
01:12:37,809 --> 01:12:39,276
Spotted them?

1165
01:12:39,611 --> 01:12:42,444
Did it work in some movie
that you got beat up in?

1166
01:12:43,448 --> 01:12:45,439
Got to askyou for that key back.

1167
01:12:45,951 --> 01:12:49,284
Wait. The setup didn't work,
and you want the key back?

1168
01:12:49,721 --> 01:12:52,554
Bo said ifyou didn't open the locker,
the deal's off.

1169
01:12:53,224 --> 01:12:54,782
You're serious?

1170
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:58,052
This is how you guys do business?
I'm surprised you're not dead.

1171
01:12:58,964 --> 01:13:01,558
There's no fucking way
you'll get the key.

1172
01:13:01,633 --> 01:13:03,965
Unless you put a gun to my head.
Then maybe we'll talk.

1173
01:13:04,035 --> 01:13:05,866
Move away
from the fucking car.

1174
01:13:06,137 --> 01:13:07,968
I don't need a gun foryou.

1175
01:13:11,242 --> 01:13:12,903
All right.
Slow down.

1176
01:13:12,978 --> 01:13:14,809
Breathe through your mouth.

1177
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,911
Breathe.

1178
01:13:19,084 --> 01:13:20,779
Bear, look at me.

1179
01:13:23,188 --> 01:13:25,520
Tell your boss
I don't wanna see him again.

1180
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:28,821
He made a deal with Harry,
and a deal's a deal.

1181
01:13:28,893 --> 01:13:30,724
Got that?
Okay, get up.

1182
01:13:34,332 --> 01:13:36,664
Why are you hanging around a guy
like that?

1183
01:13:37,502 --> 01:13:39,595
You were in the movies.
You were a stuntman, right?

1184
01:13:40,271 --> 01:13:42,603
What's he ever done
he can talk about?

1185
01:13:44,175 --> 01:13:46,405
-You okay?
-Not too bad.

1186
01:13:46,978 --> 01:13:48,969
How about when you fell
down the stairs?

1187
01:13:50,348 --> 01:13:51,838
Pulled my quadriceps.

1188
01:13:53,785 --> 01:13:55,446
How many movies you been in?

1189
01:13:56,187 --> 01:13:57,347
About 60.

1190
01:13:57,622 --> 01:13:59,249
-No shit?
-No shit.

1191
01:13:59,324 --> 01:14:01,315
What were some ofthem?

1192
01:14:01,393 --> 01:14:03,384
You didn't see
none ofthem.

1193
01:14:10,969 --> 01:14:12,300
Harry Zimm?

1194
01:14:14,706 --> 01:14:16,037
Who is it?

1195
01:14:17,642 --> 01:14:20,975
I'm the dipshit
who's never been out of Miami.

1196
01:14:23,314 --> 01:14:26,715
Mr. Barboni, what a nice surprise.
Good to see you.

1197
01:14:26,885 --> 01:14:29,046
Have a seat.

1198
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,812
Right here.

1199
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:37,491
Ray Bones.

1200
01:14:37,662 --> 01:14:39,562
Barboni, sorry.

1201
01:14:46,237 --> 01:14:48,603
They say the fucking smog
is the fucking reason...

1202
01:14:48,673 --> 01:14:50,903
you have
such beautiful fucking sunsets.

1203
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,013
What do you mean
he faked them out?

1204
01:14:56,181 --> 01:14:58,172
He knewit wasa setup,
andhe wasready forit.

1205
01:14:58,249 --> 01:14:59,409
Where's the money?

1206
01:14:59,484 --> 01:15:01,315
lguess it'sstill
in the locker.

1207
01:15:01,386 --> 01:15:03,684
You guess?
You mean you don't know?

1208
01:15:03,855 --> 01:15:05,686
lmean ldon't care.

1209
01:15:05,757 --> 01:15:07,247
lreally don't care.

1210
01:15:07,692 --> 01:15:09,421
I'll call you later.

1211
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:14,023
Mr. Escobar, what a surprise.
Welcome to L.A.

1212
01:15:14,099 --> 01:15:16,966
-Where's my nephew?
-Your who?

1213
01:15:17,035 --> 01:15:19,367
Yayo!
Where is he?

1214
01:15:21,272 --> 01:15:22,933
I haven't seen Yayo.

1215
01:15:25,043 --> 01:15:29,480
He's my sister's kid. No father.
Not too bright. I think he's a retard.

1216
01:15:29,547 --> 01:15:32,948
I only gave him thejob as a favor
to my sister. You understand.

1217
01:15:33,785 --> 01:15:35,776
Family.
I know how that goes.

1218
01:15:36,121 --> 01:15:37,850
He comes up here
with our product.

1219
01:15:37,922 --> 01:15:41,619
He's supposed to return with $500,000.
He never shows up.

1220
01:15:42,327 --> 01:15:45,990
Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy.
She calls all the time. She's worried.

1221
01:15:46,297 --> 01:15:49,789
Me? I just want to know
what happened to my fucking money.

1222
01:15:50,101 --> 01:15:53,264
I gave the man his money
and sent him on his way.

1223
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,900
You gave him the money?

1224
01:15:55,974 --> 01:15:58,442
I gave him a key to a locker
that had the money in it.

1225
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,842
Why would you
put the money in a locker?

1226
01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:04,346
There were a zillion DEA guys
hanging around the terminal.

1227
01:16:04,415 --> 01:16:05,575
A zillion?

1228
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,149
That's a lot.

1229
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:10,151
Mr. Escobar, maybe your nephew
panicked and took off.

1230
01:16:10,455 --> 01:16:12,787
Why're you talking
to me this bullshit?

1231
01:16:13,491 --> 01:16:17,086
I think I have Ramon and Cesar
staple your tongue to your chin!

1232
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:20,420
What do you think?

1233
01:16:20,598 --> 01:16:22,930
I thinkyou speak
very good English, Mr. Escobar.

1234
01:16:23,668 --> 01:16:26,432
We're spending the weekend
at the Universal Sheraton.

1235
01:16:26,771 --> 01:16:28,932
Take the tour.
See the shark.

1236
01:16:29,607 --> 01:16:32,098
Check out that ''Miami Vice''
action spectacular.

1237
01:16:32,277 --> 01:16:33,676
Nice.

1238
01:16:34,112 --> 01:16:36,774
After, we're going
to come back here...

1239
01:16:36,848 --> 01:16:38,179
get my money.

1240
01:16:42,954 --> 01:16:44,512
And Yayo too.

1241
01:16:47,025 --> 01:16:48,686
His fucking nephew?

1242
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,624
Go to the bank.
Raidthe limo account.

1243
01:16:51,796 --> 01:16:54,424
We got dick in the bank.

1244
01:16:54,499 --> 01:16:56,467
We dumped it all
into Harry's movie.

1245
01:16:57,335 --> 01:16:57,368
[ Skipped item nr. 1245 ]

1246
01:16:57,368 --> 01:17:00,030
I'm talking about you,
Ray Barboni...

1247
01:17:00,205 --> 01:17:02,867
owning a piece
ofa major motion picture.

1248
01:17:02,974 --> 01:17:05,135
How much ofa piece
is entirely up to you.

1249
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:08,236
I'm saying you could invest
part ofthe 300 grand...

1250
01:17:08,313 --> 01:17:10,372
that Palmer owes you
or all of it.

1251
01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:12,038
It's up to you.

1252
01:17:12,817 --> 01:17:16,378
Where's Chili Palmer?
Where's Leo Devoe?

1253
01:17:16,554 --> 01:17:17,885
Where's my fucking money?

1254
01:17:18,056 --> 01:17:19,819
Ray, look at me.

1255
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,549
What?

1256
01:17:23,728 --> 01:17:25,161
Look at me.

1257
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:27,230
Did you say look at you?

1258
01:17:27,398 --> 01:17:28,729
Look at me, Ray.

1259
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,631
I'll tell you what, Harry.

1260
01:17:30,702 --> 01:17:32,727
Take a fucking look at this.

1261
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:36,207
And have a peek at this.

1262
01:17:37,175 --> 01:17:39,268
You know, Harry,
this...

1263
01:17:40,578 --> 01:17:42,739
is the exact fucking thing
I needed.

1264
01:17:42,914 --> 01:17:45,678
A little fucking exercise...

1265
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,681
after that long...

1266
01:17:47,852 --> 01:17:49,080
fucking...

1267
01:17:49,921 --> 01:17:51,354
plane ride.

1268
01:17:54,325 --> 01:17:56,156
You got a big problem, Harry.

1269
01:17:58,029 --> 01:18:00,520
Come on, Harry,
don't pass out on me.

1270
01:18:01,299 --> 01:18:02,960
Look at me, Harry.

1271
01:18:03,268 --> 01:18:05,429
Where's my money?

1272
01:18:05,703 --> 01:18:07,261
Where's my money?

1273
01:18:11,109 --> 01:18:13,100
I'll askyou one more time...

1274
01:18:13,278 --> 01:18:16,270
then I gotta shoot you,
you don't tell me what I want.

1275
01:18:16,447 --> 01:18:17,937
Where's my money?

1276
01:18:18,116 --> 01:18:19,447
Your money?

1277
01:18:20,051 --> 01:18:21,712
Who the fuck are you?

1278
01:18:22,453 --> 01:18:24,717
I'm Ray Barboni, from Miami.

1279
01:18:24,789 --> 01:18:26,620
Like that's
supposed to mean something?

1280
01:18:26,758 --> 01:18:29,556
The man you're standing on
belongs to me and my partner, bro'.

1281
01:18:29,627 --> 01:18:31,959
-This piece ofshit owes me money.
-Get in line.

1282
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,064
I don't like waiting in line.

1283
01:18:34,232 --> 01:18:37,633
Tough shit. This ain't Miami.
You want something, you talk to me.

1284
01:18:37,802 --> 01:18:39,793
No, no, fuckyou, fuckball.

1285
01:18:40,038 --> 01:18:42,506
L.A. is an open city, and I don't think
I have to get permission...

1286
01:18:42,573 --> 01:18:44,404
from nobody for nothing.

1287
01:18:44,475 --> 01:18:45,806
Really?

1288
01:18:47,312 --> 01:18:48,802
I just closed it.

1289
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,747
You must be one
ofthose quick-draw artists...

1290
01:18:51,916 --> 01:18:55,408
because you got your gun
stuck way down in your belt.

1291
01:18:55,987 --> 01:18:59,150
What do you got there?
A wop nine?

1292
01:18:59,424 --> 01:19:02,484
Fucking Fiat of guns,
alwaysjamming at the wrong time.

1293
01:19:07,832 --> 01:19:09,823
Don't you puke
on my shoes, Harry.

1294
01:19:12,437 --> 01:19:14,496
I want you to do me a favor.

1295
01:19:15,073 --> 01:19:17,064
I want you to take this gun...

1296
01:19:17,141 --> 01:19:19,132
and put a pill
in the bro' over there.

1297
01:19:19,344 --> 01:19:23,178
I know you're thinking, ''Why fucking
shoot him? He's already dead.''

1298
01:19:23,247 --> 01:19:25,306
But you see,
the police have these tests...

1299
01:19:25,383 --> 01:19:27,374
tell you whether or not
a guy fired a gun...

1300
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:29,550
and I was never here.

1301
01:19:29,954 --> 01:19:32,980
Understand, Harry?
I was never here.

1302
01:19:33,691 --> 01:19:35,454
Ifyou say I was...

1303
01:19:35,626 --> 01:19:39,187
I'll come back
and throw you out the fucking window.

1304
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:43,364
Knock it off, Harry.
We haven't got a lot oftime.

1305
01:19:43,534 --> 01:19:44,865
That's it.

1306
01:19:45,303 --> 01:19:46,793
That's it.

1307
01:19:48,873 --> 01:19:50,966
Not a worry in the world.

1308
01:19:51,809 --> 01:19:53,538
Your pool needs skimming.

1309
01:19:55,313 --> 01:19:58,043
Martin wants to have lunch tomorrow,
ifyou can make it.

1310
01:19:58,216 --> 01:19:59,547
Depends on who pays.

1311
01:19:59,717 --> 01:20:02,982
Definitely not Martin.
Movie stars never pick up the check.

1312
01:20:03,087 --> 01:20:05,078
They have no idea
what things cost.

1313
01:20:05,156 --> 01:20:08,717
Most ofthem don't know
their phone number or zip code.

1314
01:20:10,395 --> 01:20:13,023
I can't imagine
the two ofyou together.

1315
01:20:13,097 --> 01:20:15,088
You don't like Martin much,
do you?

1316
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:17,657
No, I do. I do.
I think he's--

1317
01:20:17,902 --> 01:20:19,733
I think he's short.

1318
01:20:23,841 --> 01:20:28,403
I know he's a good actor, but what
was it exactly that you saw in him?

1319
01:20:30,248 --> 01:20:32,182
Martin was different then.

1320
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:34,241
He wasn't a movie star.

1321
01:20:35,353 --> 01:20:37,514
Anyway, what about your story?

1322
01:20:37,588 --> 01:20:38,919
Thought ofa title?

1323
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:40,685
How about, ''Get Shorty?''

1324
01:20:41,259 --> 01:20:43,420
How about,
''Chili's Hollywood Adventure?''

1325
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:47,086
That's a different story.
I'm still working on that one.

1326
01:20:47,365 --> 01:20:50,095
I'm still getting
the visual fabric together.

1327
01:20:50,268 --> 01:20:52,259
But I have added to it.

1328
01:20:52,937 --> 01:20:54,928
There's a girl in it now.

1329
01:20:55,106 --> 01:20:56,266
Really?

1330
01:20:57,542 --> 01:20:59,373
She looks a lot like you.

1331
01:21:04,115 --> 01:21:05,946
I thinkyou could be an actor.

1332
01:21:06,117 --> 01:21:08,779
I know you're acting sometimes,
but you don't show it.

1333
01:21:08,953 --> 01:21:10,614
You thought I was faking?

1334
01:21:11,122 --> 01:21:12,953
No, not then.

1335
01:21:13,124 --> 01:21:14,785
I mean in general.

1336
01:21:15,059 --> 01:21:18,392
You don't mean a movie star, right?
You mean more like a character actor?

1337
01:21:18,463 --> 01:21:20,397
Well, whichever.

1338
01:21:20,731 --> 01:21:23,723
I could see myself in the parts
a Robert DeNiro plays.

1339
01:21:23,901 --> 01:21:28,065
Maybe even an Al Pacino movie.
I'm playing a real hard-on.

1340
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:31,902
I can't see myself in a movie
where 3 guys get left with a baby...

1341
01:21:32,076 --> 01:21:35,307
and they act like 3 grown-up assholes,
like they're all cute.

1342
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,141
Chili, look at me.

1343
01:21:44,322 --> 01:21:46,153
Leave a message.

1344
01:21:46,491 --> 01:21:48,254
Hi, Karen, it'sDoris.

1345
01:21:48,426 --> 01:21:51,486
You might want to come by Cedars
tonight and visit Harry.

1346
01:21:51,562 --> 01:21:53,553
He's in the emergency room.

1347
01:21:55,433 --> 01:21:56,764
Let's go.

1348
01:21:58,269 --> 01:22:00,533
I stopped by his office...

1349
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:02,935
to see if he wanted to take me
to Le Dome for dinner.

1350
01:22:03,007 --> 01:22:06,773
I saw Harry and some other man
lying on the floor.

1351
01:22:07,278 --> 01:22:09,678
Good night, Todd.
Good night, Louis.

1352
01:22:10,314 --> 01:22:11,645
Oh, man.

1353
01:22:12,517 --> 01:22:14,951
-Jesus.
-Harry, my God.

1354
01:22:15,019 --> 01:22:16,884
He can't talk.
He's full of Demerol.

1355
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:18,444
What happened?

1356
01:22:18,523 --> 01:22:20,684
According to Todd--
Sergeant Randall--

1357
01:22:21,192 --> 01:22:24,684
a man named Ronnie came by
Harry's office to collect on a debt.

1358
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:26,693
He got rough,
and Harry shot him.

1359
01:22:26,764 --> 01:22:27,788
You shot Ronnie?

1360
01:22:32,403 --> 01:22:34,928
Hello, hello.
Okay, here we go.

1361
01:22:35,373 --> 01:22:39,434
Looks like Mr. Zimm has a broken jaw
and some neck trauma...

1362
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:42,035
to go with these fractured hands.

1363
01:22:43,014 --> 01:22:44,845
Excuse us, folks.

1364
01:22:50,154 --> 01:22:52,987
Martin wanted to meet us
for lunch tomorrow at the Ivy.

1365
01:22:53,057 --> 01:22:55,252
I'd cancel, but he's going
to Cannes next week...

1366
01:22:55,459 --> 01:22:58,394
so I really think maybe
Chili and I should still go.

1367
01:22:58,462 --> 01:23:01,727
Who wants to take a crack
at wiring Mr. Zimm'sjaw?

1368
01:23:06,404 --> 01:23:07,837
Son ofa bitch.

1369
01:23:08,005 --> 01:23:09,996
Hi, Bo!

1370
01:23:10,341 --> 01:23:11,774
Hey, Farrah.

1371
01:23:11,842 --> 01:23:13,173
Little honey bunny.

1372
01:23:13,344 --> 01:23:15,539
You wipe your feet
before you came in?

1373
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,080
That's my girl.

1374
01:23:18,182 --> 01:23:20,173
Keep Uncle Bo's carpet
nice and white.

1375
01:23:20,685 --> 01:23:22,619
I been calling you, man.
Where you been?

1376
01:23:22,687 --> 01:23:24,018
See the paper?

1377
01:23:24,088 --> 01:23:26,579
Yeah, I seen it.
I don't believe it.

1378
01:23:27,091 --> 01:23:29,423
Says Harry shot
Ronnie five times.

1379
01:23:29,594 --> 01:23:31,755
Four through the chest
and one through his foot?

1380
01:23:32,263 --> 01:23:35,357
His foot,Jesus.
Poor Ronnie.

1381
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:39,431
Tonight, I got one foryou
that doesn't involve any heavy work.

1382
01:23:39,604 --> 01:23:41,936
Go take a look
around Chili's hotel room.

1383
01:23:42,273 --> 01:23:43,433
I can't.

1384
01:23:45,276 --> 01:23:48,109
I gotta take Farrah
over to her mother's in Costa Mesa...

1385
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:52,072
and that don't matter,
'cause I quit.

1386
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:54,818
I don't work foryou no more.
I came to tell you...

1387
01:23:54,885 --> 01:23:56,716
to your face,
so we got no misunderstanding.

1388
01:23:56,787 --> 01:23:59,449
The Colombians are in L.A.,
all upset about their money.

1389
01:23:59,624 --> 01:24:03,788
Ifthat ain't enough, it turns out
that Yo-Yo was Escobar's nephew.

1390
01:24:04,028 --> 01:24:06,258
That's your problem.
You shot the guy.

1391
01:24:10,901 --> 01:24:13,961
Honey bunny. Come here.
Come here, honey bunny.

1392
01:24:14,138 --> 01:24:16,072
Come see Uncle Bo.

1393
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,141
You know Uncle Bo
hates being alone.

1394
01:24:20,578 --> 01:24:22,569
In fact he hates it so much...

1395
01:24:22,647 --> 01:24:24,911
he takes a fall,
he's not going to fall by himself.

1396
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:26,745
He'll plea-deal his way out.

1397
01:24:27,418 --> 01:24:31,252
Give up his ace stuntman,
now one ofthe West's dope kings...

1398
01:24:31,422 --> 01:24:32,912
ifthey go easy on the cat.

1399
01:24:33,624 --> 01:24:36,184
I hear in federal joints they let you
spend an extra five minutes...

1400
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:38,751
with your daddy on Father's Day.

1401
01:24:38,996 --> 01:24:40,486
Let her go.

1402
01:24:47,872 --> 01:24:49,863
After this one, I'm out.
You understand?

1403
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,931
This is the last time
we talk to each other.

1404
01:24:52,109 --> 01:24:55,340
Remember Harry's story
about the dry cleaner Palmer was after--

1405
01:24:55,513 --> 01:24:58,004
the one who stole $300,000
from the airline?

1406
01:24:58,182 --> 01:24:59,615
What about him?

1407
01:25:00,184 --> 01:25:04,348
Tonight, look around Palmer's hotel room
while I check out Karen's place.

1408
01:25:04,522 --> 01:25:08,686
See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
Meet me back here at midnight.

1409
01:25:12,363 --> 01:25:15,127
What kind offood do they got
at this Ivy place?

1410
01:25:15,299 --> 01:25:18,234
Continental, but it doesn't matter.
Martin won't order from the menu.

1411
01:25:18,302 --> 01:25:19,291
Why not?

1412
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:21,861
Movie stars can never order
straight from the menu.

1413
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:25,304
They have to think ofsomething they
have to have that isn't on the menu.

1414
01:25:32,783 --> 01:25:35,616
Why're you here?
You're supposed to be in the hospital.

1415
01:25:36,787 --> 01:25:39,620
You look like you should be
in one ofyour horror movies.

1416
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:41,121
My project!

1417
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:43,624
-What did he say?
-My project.

1418
01:25:47,465 --> 01:25:49,956
Thattaboy, Killer!

1419
01:25:50,735 --> 01:25:52,464
Right this way.

1420
01:25:57,475 --> 01:26:01,411
You're a celebrity.
Should've shot someone a long time ago.

1421
01:26:15,693 --> 01:26:17,524
Excuse me.
How're you?

1422
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:24,924
-Good to see you.
-Great to see you.

1423
01:26:28,172 --> 01:26:29,662
Oh, my goodness.

1424
01:26:35,179 --> 01:26:36,942
Sweet face.

1425
01:26:37,615 --> 01:26:38,673
You look great.

1426
01:26:39,016 --> 01:26:40,608
Smell good too.

1427
01:26:47,124 --> 01:26:49,285
I hearyou had
quite an experience.

1428
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,519
Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.

1429
01:26:51,796 --> 01:26:55,527
You know what else? I'm really glad
you rejected me ten years ago...

1430
01:26:55,766 --> 01:26:59,930
when I auditioned for Eddie Solomon,
the pedophile clown in ''Birthday Boy.''

1431
01:27:00,037 --> 01:27:02,870
If I'd have gotten that part,
I might have been typecast.

1432
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:06,733
Have you guys ordered?
I have something after this.

1433
01:27:06,811 --> 01:27:09,302
Can we order?
Excuse me, can you--

1434
01:27:10,681 --> 01:27:12,672
-Hi, what's your name?
-Stephanie.

1435
01:27:12,883 --> 01:27:16,717
Can you make me an egg white omelette
but with shallots?

1436
01:27:16,887 --> 01:27:19,481
Shallots only slightly browned,
very little olive oil.

1437
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:21,080
And no salt.

1438
01:27:21,492 --> 01:27:24,655
Why don't you bring one for the table?
We'll all pick on it.

1439
01:27:25,162 --> 01:27:28,495
I know, how about having
those strawberry frappes?

1440
01:27:28,666 --> 01:27:32,500
The drink with the little strawberries.
Bring two straws for Harry.

1441
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:38,566
I think the romance angle in your story
is critically important.

1442
01:27:38,742 --> 01:27:41,734
It shouldn't bejust a hop
in the sack for either ofthem.

1443
01:27:41,912 --> 01:27:43,675
They should fall deeply in love.

1444
01:27:43,747 --> 01:27:44,941
Which two?

1445
01:27:45,015 --> 01:27:47,313
Later, when their lives
are in danger...

1446
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:50,514
and the mob guy is chasing them,
it not only heightens the tension...

1447
01:27:50,588 --> 01:27:52,681
but it adds a wistful element
to their romance.

1448
01:27:52,756 --> 01:27:53,848
Mob guy?

1449
01:27:53,924 --> 01:27:55,915
I have to consider,
as the mob guy...

1450
01:27:55,993 --> 01:27:57,984
it's another man's wife
I'm sleeping with.

1451
01:27:58,529 --> 01:28:00,861
And you have such morals.

1452
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:02,191
Mob guy?

1453
01:28:02,766 --> 01:28:04,529
I have to run.

1454
01:28:04,768 --> 01:28:06,861
What I'd like to see is that...

1455
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:09,434
they begin to have misgivings
about wanting the money.

1456
01:28:09,607 --> 01:28:11,768
This becomes a moral dilemma.

1457
01:28:11,942 --> 01:28:15,537
They rationalize taking it,
but in the end, they can't.

1458
01:28:15,646 --> 01:28:16,806
What money?

1459
01:28:16,881 --> 01:28:18,815
The 300 large.
What other money is there?

1460
01:28:18,883 --> 01:28:21,044
I know I shouldn't talk about it
until I've read the script...

1461
01:28:21,118 --> 01:28:23,450
but I have such a good feeling
about this.

1462
01:28:24,455 --> 01:28:26,286
I am that shylock.

1463
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,959
Look at me.

1464
01:28:33,397 --> 01:28:35,627
Not bad.
You're getting it down.

1465
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:38,630
It scares me
how well I know this guy.

1466
01:28:38,802 --> 01:28:42,294
I could do this tomorrow,
no further preparation.

1467
01:28:44,975 --> 01:28:46,237
Dollface.

1468
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:48,735
You really should think
about getting back into acting.

1469
01:28:48,879 --> 01:28:50,540
We could do something together.

1470
01:28:50,648 --> 01:28:53,082
I'll give it some heavy thought.

1471
01:28:58,756 --> 01:29:00,246
Take care ofyourself.

1472
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:06,320
Enjoy.

1473
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:15,333
Here, let me help you out.
Go ahead.

1474
01:29:20,344 --> 01:29:21,777
Suck harder.

1475
01:29:31,455 --> 01:29:33,946
Wake up!
Somebody's downstairs.

1476
01:29:34,191 --> 01:29:35,351
It's Harry.

1477
01:29:35,426 --> 01:29:36,916
How do you know?

1478
01:29:37,194 --> 01:29:40,129
He's doing the same thing you did.
Playing ''Letterman'' on TV.

1479
01:29:40,297 --> 01:29:42,288
That's not Dave.
That's a movie.

1480
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:45,526
-You going down?
-I don't know.

1481
01:29:45,703 --> 01:29:47,136
You don't know?

1482
01:29:47,304 --> 01:29:49,465
I don't know.
I'm going.

1483
01:29:53,944 --> 01:29:56,105
-Karen, you got a gun?
-No!

1484
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:59,044
-Any kind of gun will do.
-No!

1485
01:30:07,224 --> 01:30:09,215
Sounds like ''Rio Bravo.''

1486
01:30:29,346 --> 01:30:31,746
Guessl'lltake
that drinknow, Charlie.

1487
01:30:32,549 --> 01:30:34,210
lthoughtyou would.

1488
01:30:40,524 --> 01:30:42,685
You want thatgun?
Pickit up.

1489
01:30:43,227 --> 01:30:45,127
l wishyou would.

1490
01:30:47,998 --> 01:30:49,329
I need the money.

1491
01:30:50,267 --> 01:30:51,529
What money?

1492
01:30:51,602 --> 01:30:54,935
The 300 grand you got
from a dry cleaner named Leo.

1493
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:56,529
Let's me get this straight.

1494
01:30:56,607 --> 01:30:58,768
You break
into Karen Flores' house...

1495
01:30:58,842 --> 01:31:01,367
and you ask for 300 grand
that doesn't belong to you.

1496
01:31:01,445 --> 01:31:02,878
Give me the money.

1497
01:31:03,047 --> 01:31:05,379
I can't believe how you guys
do business out here.

1498
01:31:05,449 --> 01:31:07,474
I can't believe how fucked up
your organization is.

1499
01:31:07,551 --> 01:31:13,217
How about I count to three and organize
your brain all over the wall? One.

1500
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:15,153
You're going to shoot me?

1501
01:31:15,225 --> 01:31:17,489
-Just a second. Two.
-I can't believe this.

1502
01:31:24,968 --> 01:31:26,959
She can't talk right now.

1503
01:31:28,005 --> 01:31:30,496
That's a nice scream.
They ought to give you more work.

1504
01:31:30,574 --> 01:31:32,906
All right, I'll get you the money,
but it's not here.

1505
01:31:32,976 --> 01:31:35,240
-I gotta go get it.
-Okay, fine.

1506
01:31:35,312 --> 01:31:37,303
In the meantime,
I'll hold her for safekeeping.

1507
01:31:37,381 --> 01:31:39,713
-Do you know Laurel Canyon?
-I'll find it.

1508
01:31:40,184 --> 01:31:42,618
81 50 Wonderland Avenue.
Right off Laurel.

1509
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,751
I'll be there, Karen.

1510
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:57,256
-You get the money?
-No.

1511
01:31:57,735 --> 01:31:59,862
-What is this?
-Plan B.

1512
01:32:02,106 --> 01:32:04,097
Make yourselfcomfortable.

1513
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:10,670
-She's a movie star!
-I don't care!

1514
01:32:10,748 --> 01:32:11,908
For chrissake.

1515
01:32:12,015 --> 01:32:14,176
-Going to make a trade.
-For what?

1516
01:32:14,351 --> 01:32:16,444
-The money.
-You get life for kidnapping.

1517
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,818
-Calm down.
-Life in prison!

1518
01:32:18,889 --> 01:32:21,050
-You want me to calm down!
-Do not fade on me, Bear.

1519
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:23,457
What, are you
going to shoot me now?

1520
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:25,618
Go ahead!
Put me out of my misery!

1521
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:27,457
Calm the hell down...

1522
01:32:27,531 --> 01:32:30,523
unless you want to spend the rest
ofyour life holding Farrah...

1523
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:32,762
in a room
full of goddamned felons!

1524
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:35,532
So!

1525
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:38,707
This is one ofthem houses you see
hanging offthe side ofthe cliff.

1526
01:32:39,443 --> 01:32:40,774
Where's Karen?

1527
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:43,871
In my bathroom.
Where's the money?

1528
01:32:49,153 --> 01:32:51,485
-Let me see her.
-Go ahead.

1529
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:55,489
You okay?

1530
01:32:55,659 --> 01:32:58,059
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet!

1531
01:32:58,729 --> 01:33:01,493
She's great.
Give me the money.

1532
01:33:02,099 --> 01:33:04,090
First, I'm gonna settle something
between you and me.

1533
01:33:04,468 --> 01:33:06,459
Now, I've been shot at before...

1534
01:33:06,537 --> 01:33:08,437
once by accident,
twice on purpose...

1535
01:33:08,505 --> 01:33:09,494
and I'm still here.

1536
01:33:09,573 --> 01:33:11,564
I'm gonna be here
as long as I want.

1537
01:33:11,775 --> 01:33:14,243
Which means you gotta be
somewhere else.

1538
01:33:14,311 --> 01:33:15,972
Nowhere near me,
Karen or Harry.

1539
01:33:16,046 --> 01:33:17,308
Here's your money.

1540
01:33:17,414 --> 01:33:18,972
Take it and leave...

1541
01:33:19,049 --> 01:33:21,882
the movie business to the rest of us
who know what we're doing.

1542
01:33:23,453 --> 01:33:25,114
Come on, Karen.

1543
01:33:30,527 --> 01:33:32,859
You broke in my house,
and I have a witness to it.

1544
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:33,919
What?

1545
01:33:33,997 --> 01:33:36,830
Only this time it ain't noJohn Wayne
or Dean Martin shooting bad guys...

1546
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,733
-in ''El Dorado.''
-That was ''Rio Bravo.''

1547
01:33:39,803 --> 01:33:42,203
Robert Mitchum played the drunk
in ''El Dorado.''

1548
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:44,934
Dean Martin played the drunk
in ''Rio Bravo.''

1549
01:33:45,008 --> 01:33:48,034
Basically, it was the same part.
John Wayne did the same in both.

1550
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:49,873
He played John Wayne.

1551
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:52,039
Man, I can't wait
foryou to be dead.

1552
01:33:52,182 --> 01:33:53,843
Are you going to--

1553
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:59,121
That's for the stairs,
and that's for the airport.

1554
01:34:00,057 --> 01:34:02,719
Get him off my carpet
before he starts to bleed.

1555
01:34:06,263 --> 01:34:08,094
You want to take this guy out?

1556
01:34:08,165 --> 01:34:10,360
Come out to the deck.
Make it look like he came at us.

1557
01:34:10,434 --> 01:34:12,425
You shoot him.
Self-defense.

1558
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:16,630
-Shouldn't he have a weapon? A knife?
-Get it later.

1559
01:34:17,074 --> 01:34:19,008
All right, that's enough.

1560
01:34:19,076 --> 01:34:22,375
You keep hitting him like that,
he won't look like he broke in.

1561
01:34:22,446 --> 01:34:24,778
It'll look like somebody beat him up
and then shot him.

1562
01:34:25,249 --> 01:34:26,739
No, he ain't.

1563
01:34:35,225 --> 01:34:37,216
Hold on!
We gotta get out of here!

1564
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:39,854
What are you doing?

1565
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,262
-What are you doing?
-Oh, shit.

1566
01:34:42,332 --> 01:34:44,323
She's shooting at us!

1567
01:34:48,939 --> 01:34:50,668
I'm sorry.

1568
01:34:50,941 --> 01:34:52,101
I'm sorry.

1569
01:34:58,115 --> 01:35:00,049
How do you think
that happened?

1570
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:02,141
Beats the shit out of me.

1571
01:35:15,465 --> 01:35:17,126
Were you scared up there?

1572
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,360
You bet.

1573
01:35:18,468 --> 01:35:19,958
You don't act like it.

1574
01:35:20,137 --> 01:35:23,698
I was scared then, not now.
How long you want me to be scared?

1575
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:26,973
I'll be right back.

1576
01:35:48,665 --> 01:35:49,723
How'd you get in?

1577
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,891
It was easy.
I told them I was you.

1578
01:35:51,969 --> 01:35:54,437
I acted real stupid,
and they believed me.

1579
01:35:54,504 --> 01:35:56,165
What brings you to L.A., Bones?

1580
01:35:56,306 --> 01:35:58,638
Please, don't insult me.
Just turn around.

1581
01:35:58,709 --> 01:36:00,199
Turn around!

1582
01:36:02,412 --> 01:36:05,176
Do you know that you're
the dumbest fuck I've ever met?

1583
01:36:05,349 --> 01:36:07,340
Let me look in these pockets.

1584
01:36:07,517 --> 01:36:10,179
You should've told me about Leo
as soon as you found out.

1585
01:36:10,253 --> 01:36:11,584
Why would I do that?

1586
01:36:11,755 --> 01:36:16,021
Because he's a customer of mine.
Dummy. He belongs to me.

1587
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:21,026
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

1588
01:36:21,431 --> 01:36:23,524
C-1 8.

1589
01:36:23,934 --> 01:36:25,925
I wonder what this could be?

1590
01:36:26,203 --> 01:36:27,864
A locker key?

1591
01:36:28,138 --> 01:36:29,469
But where's the locker?

1592
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:32,101
I checked the bag at the airport.

1593
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:33,873
Which terminal?

1594
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:36,342
Which terminal!

1595
01:36:36,413 --> 01:36:37,744
Sovereign.

1596
01:36:41,218 --> 01:36:43,049
You found Leo.

1597
01:36:43,286 --> 01:36:47,950
You took the poor bastard's money.
You put it in a locker ready to go.

1598
01:36:48,759 --> 01:36:50,590
Why haven't you left?

1599
01:36:50,961 --> 01:36:52,792
I like it out here.

1600
01:36:55,465 --> 01:36:57,626
You know, Chili,
I've been thinking.

1601
01:36:57,901 --> 01:37:00,893
There's really no reason
why you and I shouldn't get along.

1602
01:37:01,138 --> 01:37:03,470
Forget all the stuff
that happened.

1603
01:37:04,074 --> 01:37:06,736
I don't even remember
how this mess started.

1604
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:09,640
You took a swing at me for some
fucking thing. I say, ''Fuck it.''

1605
01:37:09,746 --> 01:37:11,976
I say you owe me money.
Fuck that.

1606
01:37:12,149 --> 01:37:15,414
I say you owe me thejuice on the money?
Fuck that too.

1607
01:37:15,585 --> 01:37:17,416
I say live and let die.

1608
01:37:17,754 --> 01:37:19,085
But this...

1609
01:37:19,589 --> 01:37:22,251
is strictly between you and I.

1610
01:37:23,326 --> 01:37:24,816
You say nothing...

1611
01:37:24,995 --> 01:37:26,929
to nobody about this.
Understood?

1612
01:37:26,997 --> 01:37:28,259
Whateveryou say.

1613
01:37:28,331 --> 01:37:30,265
I think it's only fair.

1614
01:37:31,835 --> 01:37:33,598
Then it's all settled.

1615
01:37:33,837 --> 01:37:35,270
I'll see you around.

1616
01:37:38,008 --> 01:37:39,600
Dumb fuck.

1617
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:56,452
Come on.

1618
01:38:03,867 --> 01:38:05,528
The fucking airport.

1619
01:38:54,584 --> 01:38:56,347
Bingo, boys.
Let's go.

1620
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:59,011
Hey, Bones,
look at me.

1621
01:39:04,861 --> 01:39:07,352
Fuckyou, fuckball.

1622
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,589
Damn!

1623
01:39:11,768 --> 01:39:13,599
Cut! Cut!

1624
01:39:14,104 --> 01:39:17,938
-I'm pushing the right button.
-You're not, or it wouldn't fall.

1625
01:39:18,108 --> 01:39:20,099
Every take I push the right button.

1626
01:39:20,277 --> 01:39:22,609
Bear, man,
you show him how to do it.

1627
01:39:22,779 --> 01:39:24,212
I don't really know.

1628
01:39:24,381 --> 01:39:26,372
What do you want to do, Harry?

1629
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:28,281
Wrap.

1630
01:39:28,451 --> 01:39:30,442
It's a wrap.
Come back tomorrow.

1631
01:39:31,621 --> 01:39:35,284
What're you doing? You should've gone
into overtime to get that shot.

1632
01:39:35,458 --> 01:39:38,450
This is only the second day.
We're already two weeks behind.

1633
01:39:39,563 --> 01:39:41,394
Do me a favor, okay?

1634
01:39:41,464 --> 01:39:44,797
I don't understand.
Martin told me that he loves it.

1635
01:39:44,968 --> 01:39:47,630
I just don't think
Martin is right, okay?

1636
01:39:47,804 --> 01:39:50,238
-Why the hell not?
-He's too short.

1637
01:39:50,407 --> 01:39:51,396
Come on.

1638
01:39:52,142 --> 01:39:54,133
Why does he keep pushing Martin?

1639
01:39:54,311 --> 01:39:55,471
Packaging.

1640
01:39:55,579 --> 01:39:58,412
You can't make a Martin Weir
into a Mel Gibson.

1641
01:39:58,982 --> 01:40:02,975
Where do you want to go?
Morton's or Dan Tana's?
