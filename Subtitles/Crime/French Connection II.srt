1
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:16,517
(speaking French)

2
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,335
(speaking French)

3
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,772
Taking your number, fella. I got it.

4
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,609
That's in case you screwed me.

5
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,777
- Bartlemy!
- Pardon?

6
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:33,738
Bart...

7
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:37,450
Bartlemy.

8
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:41,954
Ah.

9
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:59,180
- Bartlemy.
- Hm?

10
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,557
- Bartlemy.
- Barthélémy?

11
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:04,769
- Bartlemy. Yeah.
- (French)

12
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:07,355
- Which one?
- (French)

13
00:06:08,523 --> 00:06:10,358
Barthélémy.

14
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,209
(French)

15
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:31,003
Bartlemy?

16
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:33,172
Bartlemy.

17
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:38,594
I'm Doyle.

18
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:42,598
Ah. Doyle. Henri Barthélémy.

19
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:45,685
- Bartlemy.
- We were expecting you.

20
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,187
- A little spare-time work?
- Narcotics.

21
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:51,190
- In the fish?
- In the fish.

22
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:54,819
Unfortunately this is our information,
Monsieur Doyle.

23
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:59,407
(French)

24
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:07,915
Oh, pardon me. Inspectors Diron and Miletto.
Monsieur Doyle de New York.

25
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,671
- We shall work together.
- Great.

26
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:14,922
Henri!

27
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:17,091
(French)

28
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:31,272
(French)

29
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:50,458
- What's all this about?
- Poisson d'avril.

30
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,044
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:56,088
April Fools' Day.

32
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:58,674
You know? We are the first of April.

33
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:01,761
You see, this information was a bad joke.

34
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,935
Over here, on April Fools' Day, it's a custom
to pin a fish on people. You know?

35
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,729
Only it's usually a paper one.

36
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:15,274
They really pinned it to you this time.

37
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:17,527
This way, please.

38
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,668
"Doyle, James R."

39
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:38,130
(French)

40
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,978
"42 years old. Nickname: Popeye."

41
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,278
Cute.

42
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:03,906
Spinach.

43
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:08,786
What are you doin' with my file
in the shithouse, huh?

44
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:11,330
This another one of your April Fool jokes?

45
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:13,791
No. I like reading it here.

46
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,795
Uh...

47
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:21,591
60 kilos of heroin. It was a big arrest.

48
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:26,512
Regarde, Miletto.
We have an authentic American hero here.

49
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:30,850
Where the fuck did you get that?

50
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:33,686
Mr. Doyle, I was requested to help you.

51
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:36,564
I didn't request that you come here.

52
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:41,319
But naturally I wanted to know
who you were. I found out.

53
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:44,113
After this big arrest,...

54
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:46,407
..it disappeared.

55
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:51,537
I read in the papers that somebody stole your
heroin right out of the police headquarters.

56
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:54,999
Was it your friends?

57
00:09:57,126 --> 00:09:59,795
My friends are still on the force.

58
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,548
How many men have you killed?

59
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:05,051
Wait a fuckin' minute. Wait a minute!

60
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:08,304
Am I bein' interrogated here?

61
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:12,183
Am I workin' with you, or am l
some kind of goddamn suspect, or what?

62
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,899
Five.

63
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:22,276
Five people killed.

64
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:25,404
It seems quite a lot.

65
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,833
I've been a New York cop for 14 years.

66
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:43,256
I know that the dope that comes out of
this city has killed a lot more than I have.

67
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,764
Two of the dead were policemen.

68
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,434
Right?

69
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:58,396
Miletto, show him his office.

70
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,408
Mr. Doyle.

71
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,411
This is, uh... your office.

72
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,414
Right here.

73
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:24,672
- Yeah.
- (toilet flushes)

74
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:28,134
Right next to the, uh... the shithouse, huh?

75
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:31,637
I got a telephone, an extension... It's terrific.

76
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,931
Very nice.

77
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:39,520
Hey, Henry. It's beautiful. Really beautiful.
I'd be better off in New York on welfare.

78
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,607
Hey, poor Popeye. You are -
how do you say - homesick?

79
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:44,734
I'll send for some spinach.

80
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:48,738
Hey, Bartlemy, why don't you
knock off the chickenshit, huh?

81
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,200
I'd rather be a lamppost in New York
than the president of France.

82
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:56,537
I came over for one thing only: to get
Charnier. And that's what I'm gonna do.

83
00:11:56,662 --> 00:12:00,374
I'm gonna get him and put him
where he belongs, even if you won't.

84
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,420
Hey, bravo. It's D-day in Marseilles.
The Americans have landed.

85
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:07,298
- (French)
- (phone)

86
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,426
(French)

87
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:20,645
Hey, this Charnier of yours,
to begin with, this is certainly not his name.

88
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,691
Second, there is no record of such a man -
here, in Paris, or in the streets.

89
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,819
But there is more of a record on you,
and it's not very nice.

90
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:31,948
I must remind you,
it's you that let him escape.

91
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:38,287
Come, back to work. But you come
only with us to observe, hein?

92
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:42,625
You carry no gun, I hope.

93
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,798
- It's illegal for foreigners. Even policemen.
- No, no gun. I'm strictly by the book.

94
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:52,468
- You read my file, right?
- That's why I asked.

95
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:13,132
- Raoul?
- Oui, Henri.

96
00:14:13,257 --> 00:14:14,800
- Miletto?
- Oui.

97
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:16,677
- Prets?
- Prets.

98
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:17,929
OK.

99
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:20,097
Doyle.

100
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:23,351
You just stay close to me and observe.

101
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:28,022
You are my guest.
You do nothing, say nothing. OK?

102
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:31,526
Who, me? I'm naked, remember?

103
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:37,156
You must think I'm some sort of hero.
No, I'm just here to watch how the pros do it.

104
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:39,325
I'm your guest.

105
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,328
On y va.

106
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:48,209
(loudhailer) Ici la police!

107
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:51,671
(French)

108
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:18,364
(French)

109
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:24,829
(screaming)

110
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:31,169
Hey!

111
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,174
Hey!

112
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:41,137
Doyle! Doyle!

113
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,807
Doyle, come back! Doyle!

114
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,727
Doyle! Raoul!

115
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,751
(car horns)

116
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:52,500
(Doyle) You bastard!

117
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:56,170
Get him off me, goddamnit!

118
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:11,477
(French)

119
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:15,147
I want him arrested!
You're under arrest, you son of a bitch!

120
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:19,193
Shut up! You've got
no police powers here, Doyle!

121
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,700
Forget it. Raoul!

122
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:29,787
- Come on. Come on, Doyle.
- No! I want that bastard collared!

123
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:32,039
- You let him go?
- He's ours.

124
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,499
- What?
- He's ours!

125
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:36,169
How do you think he got out of there?
Come on.

126
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,337
(dog barks)

127
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:41,257
Holy shit.

128
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,763
(mutters)

129
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:51,142
(siren)

130
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:01,986
(Barthélémy shouts in French)

131
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:17,627
Why don't you go back to New York and
kill policemen? That's what you do best.

132
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:19,754
Raoul, tu appelles l'ambulance.

133
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:24,675
Two months' infiltration
wasted through your madness.

134
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,178
- If you'd warned me, he'd still be alive.
- No!

135
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:30,848
If you'd done what I told you,
he would still be alive.

136
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:43,402
(French)

137
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:48,324
Hey, what'd he say? What'd he say?

138
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:53,412
Look at all this stuff.
Must've been an accident, huh?

139
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,668
Look at that acid. Must be enough there
for 50 kilos. Maybe double that.

140
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:02,839
You hit him too soon. Hey, you screwed up.

141
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:04,757
I have a job for you, Doyle.

142
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:08,344
You want to know what people say?
You talk to them!

143
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:12,723
What do you mean?
Hey, you mean interrogate 'em?

144
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:17,728
What am I supposed to use - sign language?
I don't speak French, remember?

145
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:21,399
Miletto will be your interpreter. Miletto!

146
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:25,778
- Hey. Shove it.
- No, my friend. You shove it!

147
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:30,116
You don't help us outside. You just fuck up.

148
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:36,873
What do you know of Marseilles? You think
it's Harlem? Kicking blacks in the streets?

149
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:42,712
Get depositions from all of them. I don't give
a damn what they say, but I want it in writing.

150
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:46,048
Hey, look. I came over here
to nail that Frog son of a bitch good.

151
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:52,138
It's not part of my plan to sit beatin' my meat
while you French narcs grab all the credit.

152
00:19:52,263 --> 00:19:56,559
You stick me next to the shithouse
while you take all the medals, right?

153
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:59,478
That's right.

154
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,027
(siren)

155
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:11,402
We should decide
the matter of the rendezvous.

156
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:14,906
A place to meet after
you have made the delivery.

157
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:17,074
How's New York?

158
00:22:18,326 --> 00:22:24,332
You know better than that, William.
New York is hazardous to your health.

159
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,251
At least, to my health.

160
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:30,671
But it is an amusing city.

161
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:35,218
(shouts in French)

162
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:41,599
- How did you do it, if it's not a secret?
- Oh, it was very simple, and very droll.

163
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:44,727
83 policemen wanted to talk to me,...

164
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:48,189
..and 52 of them chose
to talk to my money instead.

165
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:52,860
I love a city where you always
know where you stand.

166
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:05,331
(Doyle whistles)

167
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:08,960
Hey, Hank!
I'm really learnin' a lot up here.

168
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:12,004
You're really missin' it, buddy.

169
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:18,302
(policeman) This one's named Godardi.
We arrest for drugs. One conviction.

170
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,979
I'm gonna take you right down there
in that alley. Right down there.

171
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:30,857
And we'll start on your throat, right here.

172
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:34,068
I'm gonna bust everything in it.

173
00:23:35,486 --> 00:23:39,156
You like that, huh? Then your belly.
I'll start workin' on your belly.

174
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:42,743
I'm gonna hit you so fuckin' hard,
it'll break your backbone.

175
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:44,912
- Je comprends pas.
- You compris that?

176
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:47,707
- Non.
- No, you don't understand, huh?

177
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,002
Then I'm gonna work on your arms.
I'm gonna set 'em over a kerb.

178
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:54,046
I'm gonna use 'em for a trampoline,
jump up and down on 'em.

179
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:57,008
And then your kneecaps. One, two. Kneecaps.

180
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,802
I'll make oatmeal
out of your fuckin' kneecaps.

181
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:04,223
And when I get done with you,
you are gonna put me right in Charnier's lap.

182
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:07,226
- Je ne le connais pas.
- You connais pas?

183
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:09,395
Ah, food.

184
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:16,652
What'd you do - cremate the fuckin' thing?

185
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:18,821
You cremated it. You burned...

186
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:22,200
You got the ketchup there.
Where's the mayo? The mayonnaise.

187
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:25,411
Mayonnaise. Mayo, mayo, mayo, mayo.

188
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:27,705
- Watch my mouth: mayo.
- Mayo.

189
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,917
Mayo, right. And relish. Relish.

190
00:24:31,501 --> 00:24:32,835
- Relish.
- Relish.

191
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,338
Relish, right. Mayo and relish.

192
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:38,299
- Send Miletto up too, will you?
- Hein?

193
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:40,468
- Miletto!
- Yes, yes. Miletto.

194
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,138
That's good, huh?

195
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:46,641
Hey, Miletto! Come on, get up here!

196
00:24:46,766 --> 00:24:49,352
I want ya to ask this fuck somethin'.

197
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:53,648
Ask him if he ever
picked his feet in Poughkeepsie.

198
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:56,984
- Is this comfortable for you?
- I didn't understand.

199
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:01,072
Ask him... You ever
pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

200
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,283
(French)

201
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:11,082
- I'm gonna take a walk.
- Doyle, the orders.

202
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,335
Stick your orders right here.

203
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:18,089
(thunder)

204
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:35,523
I'd like a... Four Roses,
straight up, and water on the side.

205
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:37,692
Quoi?

206
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,362
Four Roses, straight up,
and water on the side.

207
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:44,490
- Comprends pas.
- Aw, shit. Uh...

208
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,577
Bourbon.

209
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:52,415
(French accent) Bourbon. Bourbon.

210
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:58,254
(Doyle sighs) OK. Um...

211
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:02,925
Can you give me some help here?

212
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:07,638
Uh... Jack Daniels.

213
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:10,808
- Jack qui?
- Jackie, yeah. Jackie Daniels.

214
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:14,437
Jackie?

215
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:17,315
Let's see. Um...

216
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:21,402
Scotch. Right there.

217
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:24,280
- El Scotcho.
- Whisky?

218
00:26:24,405 --> 00:26:27,492
- Avec glace?
- In a glass, yeah.

219
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:43,174
No, I don't want ice. I don't want it.

220
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,057
Uh, excuse me, miss. Excuse me, ladies.

221
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:53,434
Can I offer you a little drink?

222
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,356
- A drink. Would you like a drink?
- (French)

223
00:26:58,481 --> 00:27:00,525
Comprends pas.

224
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:04,737
- Mind if I sit down?
- (French)

225
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:07,073
- What?
- (French)

226
00:27:07,198 --> 00:27:10,284
I don't understand. Just have a little drink.

227
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:16,207
OK.

228
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:32,306
How'd you like to kiss my Irish ass, huh?

229
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:36,853
- Guess that told 'em, huh?
- (motorbikes zoom off)

230
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:39,188
Hey, fella?

231
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:44,819
How about another drink here?
Give me about two fingers, like that.

232
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:46,988
- Un autre?
- Yeah. Um...

233
00:27:48,364 --> 00:27:50,533
Give yourself one too.

234
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,202
- Pour moi?
- What's your name?

235
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,788
André.

236
00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:00,209
Help yourself to one. I want...
Somebody's gonna have a drink with me.

237
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:02,712
- Um... you.
- Moi?

238
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:04,881
Right. Give yourself a drink.

239
00:28:06,424 --> 00:28:09,302
Á boire, pour moi? Merci beaucoup.

240
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:19,228
You're gonna drink that green shit?

241
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:21,939
J'aime beaucoup ça.

242
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:25,109
- That's not... Hey, come on. Fill it up.
- Merci beaucoup.

243
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:27,361
- Have a drink.
- Un double, alors.

244
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:35,286
(low voices)

245
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,960
- Pretty good drinker.
- Double?

246
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:45,129
Double.

247
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:51,677
- I hope those Hell's Angels come back.
- Mais c'est de ma part. Moi.

248
00:28:51,802 --> 00:28:53,554
Have another drink.

249
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,140
No, no, no. Have another - you.

250
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:08,361
- Santé.
- Down the hatch.

251
00:29:11,781 --> 00:29:13,825
Throw it back.

252
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:16,327
Ah!

253
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:18,704
(French)

254
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,207
- Merci.
- I'll have another.

255
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:25,419
(drunken laughter)

256
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:31,175
# The first marines bought the beans

257
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,344
# Parley-voo

258
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:37,139
# The first marines bought the beans

259
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:39,308
# Parley-voo

260
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:43,938
# Oh... the first marines, the second marines...

261
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,404
- # The first marines
- (drunken mumbling)

262
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,530
No, no.

263
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:56,993
- # The first marines
- # Ze first marines

264
00:29:57,118 --> 00:30:00,121
- # Bought the beans
- # Botza beans?

265
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:02,290
Bought the beans!

266
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:04,750
Yeah. Gimme my hat back.

267
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:06,878
Ah!

268
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:11,257
# Two marines are following me
Parley-voo

269
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:13,426
Par... Parlez-vous?

270
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:17,471
# Two marines are following me
Parley-voo

271
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:19,640
# Parlez-vous

272
00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:24,645
# Two marines are following me,
I don't think they're gonna catch me

273
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:29,692
(phone)

274
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:36,782
Oui?

275
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:38,951
Hello. Inspector?

276
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:41,412
Yes. How are you?

277
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:45,583
Well, it's... sunny, warm.

278
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:49,629
Yes. There too? Formidable.

279
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:54,300
Well, the plan is going as you said it would.

280
00:30:55,593 --> 00:31:00,848
(Barthélémy) No, I don't like it, no.
If Charnier is in Marseilles and sees him,...

281
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:03,017
..it will be very dangerous.

282
00:31:04,602 --> 00:31:10,191
Well, I have two men on Doyle, day and night.
But he is unpredictable.

283
00:31:11,025 --> 00:31:13,861
No, I would not do it this way.

284
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:20,618
First I would tell Doyle myself that he is
being used as - how do you say - as bait.

285
00:31:21,494 --> 00:31:24,580
Well, he is your man, not mine, Inspector.

286
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:30,294
Oh, yes. He is very evident, very visible, yes.

287
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,257
Hello? Hello? Merde. On a été coupé.

288
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:37,176
Hello? Hello?

289
00:31:38,135 --> 00:31:40,596
Yes, operator? We were cut off.

290
00:31:41,264 --> 00:31:44,058
I was talking to
the New York Police Department.

291
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,227
Hello?

292
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:49,647
What do you mean,
it's the French operator's fault?

293
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:52,650
What? Hello? Hello.

294
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:55,152
Hello! Merde.

295
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:57,488
(news in French)

296
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,000
(car horns)

297
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,883
(siren)

298
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:28,728
- I wanna go right there, not here.
- (French)

299
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:32,273
Do you speak English?

300
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,611
Speak English?

301
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:42,325
(car horn)

302
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,494
Hey!

303
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,373
Hey, Henry?

304
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:51,876
Pretty good.

305
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:56,422
You had a two-hour lunch?
Are you investigating the greasy spoons?

306
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:58,925
Doyle, this is Mademoiselle Lefévre.

307
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,678
- Monique, Monsieur Doyle de New York.
- Bonjour.

308
00:33:02,803 --> 00:33:06,724
- I thought that you had left us.
- No, I was... hangin' around.

309
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:11,103
I wanted to find out why Charnier
likes this burg so much. You know?

310
00:33:11,604 --> 00:33:13,689
- I think I found out.
- Found out what?

311
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:19,445
That while Charnier is walking around free,
the police are having two-hour lunches.

312
00:33:19,862 --> 00:33:24,033
- Can I get you a taxi to the airport?
- No, I think I'll just stay here.

313
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:26,202
- As you wish.
- Listen.

314
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:28,996
I want you to do me a favour.

315
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:31,958
Get your two tails off my back, will you?

316
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,252
Is the tall one your brother-in-law?

317
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:37,338
- Listen, Doyle...
- No, you listen!

318
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:41,008
I came over to get that fuckin' Charnier,
and I'm gonna get his ass.

319
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:44,929
And I could do it a lot better
if Sacco and Vanzetti were off my tail.

320
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:47,431
Put 'em back on the school crossing.

321
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:51,602
They might get run over by a bicycle.
I don't want that on my conscience.

322
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:55,189
- Nice to have met you.
- Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit?

323
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:34,020
You want this ball? Huh?

324
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:36,272
Come on. Come over and get it.

325
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,749
God, I wish this Blanc de Blancs
would travel.

326
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:39,585
I'd like to take 20 cases back to Washington.

327
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,672
All you Americans have that misconception.

328
00:35:42,797 --> 00:35:46,717
Wine will travel.
It is people who have difficulty.

329
00:35:52,682 --> 00:35:55,935
They understood about
you not travelling with the shipment.

330
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:01,274
Good. I'm pleased you all continue
to see the situation as I do.

331
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:21,419
Bill,...

332
00:36:21,544 --> 00:36:24,922
..have Geneva taken the necessary first step?

333
00:36:26,215 --> 00:36:31,637
Exactly as you wanted it, with a good spread
against inflation and floating currencies.

334
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:36,601
100,000 in South African rands,
50 in Canadian dollars, another 50 in yen.

335
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:40,062
200,000 altogether.
Ten per cent, as per the agreement.

336
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:46,777
OK. Tell them the final shipment is en route.

337
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:52,200
- Once it arrives, we cook for a few days.
- Understood.

338
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:58,664
We are expecting you for dinner.
A little party, very informal.

339
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:02,960
I'd love to but... no can do.

340
00:37:05,922 --> 00:37:07,965
Official business.

341
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,968
Looks like you guys want us back here again.

342
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:15,890
I've gotta be in Paris to have dinner with the
Minister of Defence, talk numbers and bases.

343
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,186
Thank you very much for the lunch, Alain.

344
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:23,523
Incidentally, Geneva's counting on you.

345
00:37:24,815 --> 00:37:27,735
Sorry. They wanted it made clear.

346
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,987
Naturally.

347
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:34,951
My expectations of them are the same.
Be sure they know that too.

348
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:43,209
(French)

349
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:07,984
Bonjour, mon chéri.
Je ne suis pas trop en retard?

350
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:10,153
Non, non. Pas du tout.

351
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:13,281
Mais... excuse-moi. Je suis obligé de partir.

352
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:20,746
Listen, um...

353
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:24,625
You play good volleyball.
You bounce around a lot.

354
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:28,629
I'll see you down at the beach, huh?

355
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:35,404
Sacco and Vanz...

356
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:56,611
(shouts in French)

357
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,380
(footsteps)

358
00:41:33,648 --> 00:41:38,986
I must say, Mr. Doyle, that you were
the one person I did not want to see again.

359
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,156
(French)

360
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:49,080
My... associates here want to discuss things
with you, Doyle, but in their fashion.

361
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:56,254
I told them it would be useless,
that you would die first.

362
00:41:57,588 --> 00:42:02,802
And, of course, then we would never find out
what you have learned about our...

363
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:05,346
..little business.

364
00:42:07,974 --> 00:42:10,852
That was the expensive lesson of New York.

365
00:42:11,853 --> 00:42:14,105
You're a good cop.

366
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,899
Honest, but stupid.

367
00:42:18,484 --> 00:42:20,736
But honest.

368
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:23,865
Up your ass, Charnier.

369
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:44,552
I'll tell you what I found out.

370
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,808
I found out that you eat shit,
you fuckin' Frog, you!

371
00:42:51,475 --> 00:42:55,855
- (Charnier) That's not good enough.
- You goddamn scumbag, you!

372
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,584
(thunder and rain)

373
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:06,546
(door opens gently)

374
00:46:15,054 --> 00:46:17,098
Hello.

375
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:22,395
I have a son just about your age.

376
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,564
Nice young man.

377
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,319
I'm English, you know.
I heard you speak English.

378
00:46:30,778 --> 00:46:32,864
I heard you shout.

379
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:35,116
You mustn't shout.

380
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:38,536
They never listen.

381
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:44,125
I have lived in Marseilles for 42 years.

382
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,294
Even through the war.

383
00:46:47,044 --> 00:46:49,380
I married a Frenchman.

384
00:46:50,673 --> 00:46:52,925
He wouldn't listen to me.

385
00:46:55,052 --> 00:46:58,556
And then my son went away.

386
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:03,019
Nobody listens to me.

387
00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:06,355
No, no, no, no, no, no.

388
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:10,401
You mustn't do that. You mustn't scratch.

389
00:47:11,277 --> 00:47:15,990
You'll get infected,
and then you'll be very sick.

390
00:47:16,115 --> 00:47:18,159
You must...

391
00:47:18,284 --> 00:47:20,328
Like that. See?

392
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:23,873
Hm? (chuckles)

393
00:47:39,764 --> 00:47:42,433
When will they come around again?

394
00:47:44,352 --> 00:47:46,187
Soon.

395
00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:48,022
Soon.

396
00:47:48,815 --> 00:47:50,858
But you mustn't shout.

397
00:47:51,818 --> 00:47:53,861
No one will listen.

398
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:02,495
(woman laughs deliriously outside)

399
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:18,803
(toilet flushes)

400
00:48:20,054 --> 00:48:22,098
(banging)

401
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:27,353
- (singing French song)
- (Doyle hums along)

402
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:43,286
Ah! Voilá. There you are.

403
00:48:44,453 --> 00:48:46,497
(police siren)

404
00:48:47,957 --> 00:48:50,001
(hums dreamily)

405
00:50:07,286 --> 00:50:09,539
Not yet.

406
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,044
Doyle,...

407
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:18,381
..tell me.

408
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:32,687
They sent me over here because I was
the only one who could recognise you.

409
00:50:36,107 --> 00:50:38,151
That's all.

410
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,154
I didn't find out anything.

411
00:50:45,116 --> 00:50:47,702
(sighs) You fuckhead, you.

412
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:55,376
This ain't my town. I can't even
get a goddamn drink here.

413
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:57,545
Come on.

414
00:50:58,462 --> 00:51:00,506
Come on!

415
00:51:01,048 --> 00:51:03,092
You know,...

416
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:06,470
..I believe you.

417
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:12,810
(gives order in French)

418
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,253
(Doyle mutters)

419
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:14,413
We'll take you back, Doyle, to your friends.
They are looking for you everywhere,...

420
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:17,750
..and making it difficult for me to operate.

421
00:52:18,543 --> 00:52:20,795
So we are giving you back to them.

422
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,206
- C'est l'américain.
- Oui, c'est l'américain!

423
00:52:57,331 --> 00:52:59,375
Appelle Henri.

424
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:04,463
Barthélémy!

425
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:07,008
Henri, viens vite.

426
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:09,177
Oui.

427
00:53:39,707 --> 00:53:42,585
(doctor gives instructions in French)

428
00:55:07,044 --> 00:55:08,838
(Doyle groans)

429
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,236
(machinery gurgles)

430
00:55:48,294 --> 00:55:50,338
(French)

431
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:56,010
(heart monitor beeps)

432
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:20,701
(French)

433
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:30,169
(French)

434
00:56:30,294 --> 00:56:32,338
(long beep)

435
00:57:16,716 --> 00:57:18,759
(regular beeps)

436
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,163
(Doyle vomits)

437
00:57:51,876 --> 00:57:53,920
(French)

438
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:56,964
Merci.

439
00:57:58,299 --> 00:58:00,343
(Doyle sighs)

440
00:58:22,782 --> 00:58:25,243
What are you lookin' at, asshole?

441
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,276
That's bitter.

442
00:58:58,526 --> 00:59:00,570
It's bitter.

443
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,323
(Doyle snorts and coughs)

444
00:59:04,448 --> 00:59:07,994
I need a doctor. I need an American doctor.

445
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:11,205
Doctors keep records, papers.

446
00:59:12,832 --> 00:59:14,876
- You want that?
- (retching)

447
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:17,461
Junkie cop?

448
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:20,381
They'll throw you off the police force.

449
00:59:20,506 --> 00:59:22,550
Drink.

450
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:27,054
- (retches)
- Miletto!

451
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,725
(Doyle screams)

452
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:23,569
It's cold.

453
01:00:23,694 --> 01:00:25,738
(distant voices)

454
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:33,746
- (cell door closes)
- Yeah, that oughta help a lot.

455
01:00:42,129 --> 01:00:45,007
I feel like I spent a week licking a pool table.

456
01:00:45,424 --> 01:00:47,468
It was three weeks.

457
01:00:50,471 --> 01:00:53,307
- Where were you guys?
- We looked.

458
01:00:54,976 --> 01:00:59,147
- Where the fuck were ya?
- 52 men were looking for you full time.

459
01:00:59,272 --> 01:01:04,527
Aw, shit. If I had 52 men lookin' for somebody
I'd find 'em in three hours in New York!

460
01:01:04,652 --> 01:01:09,073
- Yes, but Marseilles is not New York.
- Yeah, you're goddamn right it ain't.

461
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,284
Bet your fuckin' ass it ain't New York.

462
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,537
Scag City.

463
01:01:14,662 --> 01:01:19,500
I'd like to pull the goddamn city down brick
by brick and put it all in your fucking head.

464
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:21,669
You can relax now.

465
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:30,386
(distant laughter)

466
01:01:36,058 --> 01:01:39,437
Shit. I feel like a goddamn pincushion.

467
01:01:42,523 --> 01:01:47,236
Look, Henry... you're not gonna
make me go cold turkey, are you?

468
01:01:48,446 --> 01:01:50,865
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, look, I'm s...

469
01:01:51,657 --> 01:01:56,370
I've seen guys go cold turkey. They put
their fuckin' head right through a steel wall.

470
01:01:56,496 --> 01:02:00,791
They'd cut their mother's throat for
a $5 bag of scag. Come on, you can't make...

471
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,586
I call your mother.

472
01:02:04,045 --> 01:02:07,048
I call your mother. She will be proud of you.

473
01:02:07,173 --> 01:02:12,803
- Aw, come on. Leave her out of this.
- "Mrs. Doyle, I present your son, the hero."

474
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:17,558
- Oh, shit. Will you stop this shit?
- Did I ever tell you? I had her once.

475
01:02:18,476 --> 01:02:20,520
- What a fuck!
- Oh, you...

476
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:22,688
(Henri speaks in French)

477
01:02:34,408 --> 01:02:36,452
Don't quit now.

478
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,664
Don't give up.

479
01:02:41,999 --> 01:02:44,043
(whispers) Don't give up.

480
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:15,241
I want a fuckin' Hershey bar.

481
01:03:21,372 --> 01:03:23,416
That's OK.

482
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:41,142
It's not good for Frogs.
Makes 'em jump backwards.

483
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,854
(Doyle chuckles)

484
01:03:44,979 --> 01:03:47,023
Asshole.

485
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:42,745
(Doyle moans)

486
01:04:57,301 --> 01:04:59,345
(knocking)

487
01:05:04,851 --> 01:05:10,606
Hey. I don't want any of this fuckin' rock!
What are they givin' me?

488
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:16,946
Wait a minute... OK. What I want
is a nice, juicy PJ Clarke's hamburger.

489
01:05:17,697 --> 01:05:20,366
Understand? With blood
runnin' out of it,...

490
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:25,621
..and some onions on it and some ketchup
and salt, and a beer. OK? All right?

491
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:28,499
Henry, wait. Wait a minute.

492
01:05:29,709 --> 01:05:31,752
I need some help, Henry.

493
01:05:32,587 --> 01:05:34,672
I need some help. I want a doctor, Henry.

494
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:36,883
- A fuckin' American doctor.
- Forget it.

495
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:40,928
Don't tell me to forget it.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

496
01:05:43,723 --> 01:05:48,060
Just wait till you go get the hamburgers.
All right? I'll wait here.

497
01:05:48,186 --> 01:05:50,730
Just... wait till... All right, wait.

498
01:05:51,272 --> 01:05:52,607
Goddamn...

499
01:05:52,732 --> 01:05:55,776
Let's change the order.
I don't want the hamburgers.

500
01:05:55,902 --> 01:05:59,113
I want... I want some Hershey bars,
Henry. You know what I mean?

501
01:05:59,238 --> 01:06:04,076
Wait! I want the Hershey bars, Henry. Not
the Frog oatmeal shit you've been givin' me.

502
01:06:04,202 --> 01:06:06,621
I want real Hershey bars with the nuts in 'em.

503
01:06:06,746 --> 01:06:10,416
Henry, you got it in the office.
I know goddamn well... Henry!

504
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:13,377
Who the fuck would know, Henry?!
Goddammit!

505
01:06:19,634 --> 01:06:21,677
You motherfuckers!

506
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,891
(footsteps recede)

507
01:07:07,598 --> 01:07:09,433
(muffled protests)

508
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:16,983
Don't tell 'em anything
until you see your fuckin' lawyer!

509
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:19,152
Right?

510
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:28,870
(Doyle coughs)

511
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:33,791
This is... (coughs)

512
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:37,837
It's really good. I never
drink this at home, you know.

513
01:07:37,962 --> 01:07:41,257
"Gaston de Lagrange. Cognac."

514
01:07:41,382 --> 01:07:43,301
It's good stuff.

515
01:07:43,718 --> 01:07:46,053
Only the best for you, Doyle.

516
01:07:46,179 --> 01:07:48,222
Goddamn.

517
01:07:49,182 --> 01:07:52,768
When I was a kid, I never drank
because I thought it was a sin,...

518
01:07:52,894 --> 01:07:54,937
..because of the nuns and everything.

519
01:07:55,062 --> 01:07:58,316
- Are you Catholic?
- Retired.

520
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,819
Retired?!

521
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:07,200
Retired, huh? You just
turned in your papers and...

522
01:08:07,325 --> 01:08:09,494
Do you get a pension? (chuckles)

523
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:16,542
Oh, shit.

524
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:18,711
Ahhhh...

525
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,512
Well, besides all that...

526
01:08:29,096 --> 01:08:34,018
You didn't imagine me, did you?
But besides all that... (chuckles)

527
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:42,610
When I was a... um...

528
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:49,492
..a kid, you know, with the nuns
and the confessions and all that,...

529
01:08:49,617 --> 01:08:52,286
..I was a ballpayer... ballplayer.

530
01:08:53,412 --> 01:08:55,456
I was a ballplayer!

531
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:58,584
Baseball player.

532
01:08:58,709 --> 01:09:01,879
Yeah. You know,
I had a tryout with the Yankees.

533
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:07,844
- You know what the Yankees are?
- Yes. As in "Yankee go home."

534
01:09:07,969 --> 01:09:10,012
Yeah. No!

535
01:09:13,099 --> 01:09:14,934
No, uh...

536
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:21,899
Uh...

537
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:27,071
No, the Yankee baseball... baseball team.

538
01:09:27,488 --> 01:09:30,449
Yeah, I had a tryout with them and...

539
01:09:31,325 --> 01:09:34,704
..they sent me down to the... the minors.

540
01:09:34,829 --> 01:09:39,083
And the poblem...
poblem... problem was that...

541
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:44,630
..there was a fuckin' kid there, and he was...

542
01:09:47,592 --> 01:09:50,928
..the fastest bastard, he was fuckin' fast.

543
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:55,349
And he... he played shortstop
at the time, and he...

544
01:09:59,437 --> 01:10:02,106
He could hit the ball a fuckin' ton.

545
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,609
A fuckin' ton!

546
01:10:06,652 --> 01:10:08,946
- You know what "fuck" means?
- Yeah.

547
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,824
(Doyle chuckles) Yeah.

548
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,828
Well, I was in spring training...

549
01:10:15,953 --> 01:10:18,623
..and I saw this kid,...

550
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:22,126
..and I just immediately took the test for cops.

551
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,798
That kid was Mickey Mantle.

552
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:38,351
You know who Mickey Mantle was?

553
01:10:38,476 --> 01:10:42,063
- You fuckhead.
- No, I can't say that I know.

554
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:47,109
You don't know
who Mickey Mantle was? Huh?

555
01:10:48,694 --> 01:10:50,738
How about Willie Mays?

556
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:57,078
Say hey! Willie Mays!
The mighty Willie Mays. See?

557
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:01,165
No.

558
01:11:04,168 --> 01:11:07,380
Max Lanier. A Frog.

559
01:11:10,508 --> 01:11:14,011
Jean Kiley. You remember Jean Kiley?

560
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:18,224
- Gene Kelly?
- Gene... Not Gene Kelly.

561
01:11:19,392 --> 01:11:21,602
Jean Kiley, the fuckin' skier.

562
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:25,022
Oh. You mean Jean-Claude Killy.

563
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:28,276
That's what I said! Yes. Fuck, yeah.

564
01:11:29,777 --> 01:11:31,654
Good athlete.

565
01:11:34,115 --> 01:11:39,579
Well, and... Whitey Ford. Goddamn.
You know who Whitey Ford was?

566
01:11:41,289 --> 01:11:45,126
Oh... shit. He was a dandy little southpaw.

567
01:11:45,251 --> 01:11:48,379
That's what we called him.
He was a dandy little southpaw.

568
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:52,758
- Southpaw?
- Yeah. He was a lefty.

569
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,304
- You mean a communist?
- No, he was a Republican.

570
01:11:56,429 --> 01:12:01,184
But he was somethin', I tell you.
He was somethin'. He was...

571
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,899
He was... uh...

572
01:12:08,649 --> 01:12:10,485
..um... a lefty.

573
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:12,820
He threw with his left hand.

574
01:12:12,945 --> 01:12:15,823
Understand? With his south hand.

575
01:12:16,491 --> 01:12:18,951
With his south paw.

576
01:12:19,076 --> 01:12:21,746
That's why we called him a lefty.

577
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,541
You got it? (chuckles)

578
01:12:26,459 --> 01:12:28,503
Look here...

579
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:31,255
(mutters)

580
01:12:31,839 --> 01:12:33,925
(Doyle giggles)

581
01:12:34,133 --> 01:12:36,177
(mutters)

582
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:50,233
And the batter was standing like this.

583
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:53,778
You gotta throw me the ball.

584
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:57,240
Wait a minute. (mutters)

585
01:13:00,117 --> 01:13:02,161
OK. Ready.

586
01:13:05,665 --> 01:13:08,751
- You never saw any baseball, did you?
- No.

587
01:13:08,876 --> 01:13:10,920
Shit.

588
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:17,301
Well, Whitey Ford was a dandy southpaw.

589
01:13:18,845 --> 01:13:20,888
He was...

590
01:13:29,188 --> 01:13:31,232
(incoherent)

591
01:13:31,858 --> 01:13:34,986
Give me one, Henry, quick!

592
01:13:36,821 --> 01:13:38,865
(incoherent pleading)

593
01:13:45,413 --> 01:13:48,791
You motherfucker!

594
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,669
(Doyle sobs)

595
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,797
- Drink it.
- (yells)

596
01:14:20,948 --> 01:14:24,869
He'd hit the fuckin' apple ball
with the fuckin' stick!

597
01:14:28,372 --> 01:14:33,544
- Tell me about Southpaw.
- I told you about that fuckin' southpaw!

598
01:14:36,547 --> 01:14:39,634
- I can't take it no more!
- And Mickey Mantle.

599
01:14:39,759 --> 01:14:41,803
Mickey Mantle sucks!

600
01:14:46,724 --> 01:14:50,853
- Do you ski?
- Do I look like I can ski, you fuckhead?!

601
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,023
I can barely walk!

602
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:59,111
I need help, goddamnit!

603
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,909
Shit.

604
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:22,051
- I have your breakfast. I hope you can eat it.
- Uh... I'll try.

605
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:42,655
- Are you gonna take me home?
- Not yet.

606
01:15:46,534 --> 01:15:49,579
You were cold. We'll warm you up.

607
01:15:51,414 --> 01:15:54,709
And maybe see a little
of Marseilles too, hein?

608
01:16:12,894 --> 01:16:16,189
I don't remember anything.
They'd just knocked me on my ass.

609
01:16:16,314 --> 01:16:18,816
Anything? Any detail?

610
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:23,738
I don't remember anything.

611
01:16:46,385 --> 01:16:48,930
I'd like to have some of that.

612
01:16:49,055 --> 01:16:52,934
You're kidding. A woman now
would finish you off.

613
01:16:53,893 --> 01:16:56,062
Not the woman, dummy. What she's eating.

614
01:17:06,572 --> 01:17:08,950
Listen, asshole, tell me the truth.

615
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:14,288
I was set up, wasn't l?

616
01:17:20,419 --> 01:17:22,964
Whose idea was it?

617
01:17:23,756 --> 01:17:26,342
What difference does it make?

618
01:17:35,226 --> 01:17:37,687
They sent me over here to work with you.

619
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:46,279
You put me on the street
so Charnier could blow me away.

620
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:52,034
That's beautiful. Beautiful.

621
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:57,290
Why didn't you figure this out earlier?

622
01:18:00,001 --> 01:18:02,420
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

623
01:18:07,466 --> 01:18:09,677
Cos I'm a bigger asshole than you are.

624
01:20:19,015 --> 01:20:21,100
Henry? It's Doyle.

625
01:20:21,225 --> 01:20:24,896
- Workin' kinda late at the office, aren't ya?
- Where are you, Popeye?

626
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:27,773
I'm at Charnier's place.
I suddenly remembered it.

627
01:20:27,899 --> 01:20:31,444
It's the Hotel Colonnades.
Used to be the Hotel Tanger.

628
01:20:31,569 --> 01:20:33,821
It's on the Rue Rappatu. You got that?

629
01:20:34,405 --> 01:20:36,365
- Stay where you are.
- OK.

630
01:20:36,491 --> 01:20:40,828
Oh, Henry. Bring some water. A lot of it.

631
01:20:59,222 --> 01:21:01,265
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?

632
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,434
- Exterminator.
- Quoi?

633
01:21:03,559 --> 01:21:06,646
Rats. You got rats, buddy.

634
01:21:09,524 --> 01:21:11,567
(uproar)

635
01:21:15,488 --> 01:21:17,198
(shouting)

636
01:21:40,054 --> 01:21:43,307
Come on outta there, you fuckin' rats!

637
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:46,394
Come on out or I'll burn you out!

638
01:21:46,519 --> 01:21:49,230
- (woman screams)
- (sirens)

639
01:22:05,371 --> 01:22:08,124
Come on, you rats! Come on out!

640
01:22:15,256 --> 01:22:16,841
Everybody out!

641
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:24,307
Hey, hey, hey! Move it! Hot pussy here!

642
01:23:06,724 --> 01:23:09,769
Hey! You moustached motherfuckers!

643
01:23:17,568 --> 01:23:19,403
Hey!

644
01:23:41,592 --> 01:23:45,888
Doyle! Doyle, you knew!
You always knew the name of this place!

645
01:23:46,013 --> 01:23:50,143
You knew and you wouldn't tell me!
Doyle, I deserve an answer!

646
01:23:52,854 --> 01:23:56,023
Look at that! That's your answer. Fuck you!

647
01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:59,443
I came over after Charnier
and I'm gonna get his ass!

648
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:04,490
Where is that goddamn motherfucker?
Where is he?!

649
01:24:12,206 --> 01:24:15,376
(pleading in French)

650
01:24:17,128 --> 01:24:20,131
That's enough! Stop it, Doyle!

651
01:24:20,256 --> 01:24:23,176
- (French)
- (Doyle) Look at this, asshole!

652
01:24:23,301 --> 01:24:25,303
He told us what we want.

653
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:27,513
- That's enough now.
- OK.

654
01:24:27,638 --> 01:24:30,308
You'd better be right. I'll tell you that.

655
01:24:30,683 --> 01:24:32,727
I'll come lookin' for ya!

656
01:24:33,811 --> 01:24:35,855
I'll knock your dick stiff.

657
01:24:36,481 --> 01:24:38,524
Look at my hat.

658
01:25:18,314 --> 01:25:20,358
(French)

659
01:25:28,658 --> 01:25:30,701
(French)

660
01:25:31,744 --> 01:25:34,497
This time, Doyle, you stay right next to me.

661
01:25:35,581 --> 01:25:37,416
Come on.

662
01:28:08,067 --> 01:28:10,111
Where's my fucking gun?!

663
01:28:27,044 --> 01:28:29,130
(French)

664
01:28:40,975 --> 01:28:42,268
(French)

665
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,164
(rush of water)

666
01:29:19,806 --> 01:29:22,892
I hope you can swim, asshole!

667
01:29:44,038 --> 01:29:46,082
(French)

668
01:29:53,464 --> 01:29:56,467
Hey! Doyle, come on!

669
01:32:21,529 --> 01:32:24,031
(police siren)

670
01:32:24,157 --> 01:32:25,825
Henri! Henri!

671
01:32:59,525 --> 01:33:01,569
(knocking on door)

672
01:33:03,488 --> 01:33:05,031
Yeah?

673
01:33:05,156 --> 01:33:07,200
(Barthélémy) Doyle?

674
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:20,379
Commissaire Delacroix.
He wants your passport.

675
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:26,636
There is a plane for Barcelona in the morning
with a connection to New York.

676
01:33:26,761 --> 01:33:29,430
You'll get your passport back
when you get on it.

677
01:33:29,514 --> 01:33:32,016
(French)

678
01:33:34,852 --> 01:33:37,146
(commissaire continues in French)

679
01:33:42,193 --> 01:33:44,445
Do you need me to translate?

680
01:33:48,991 --> 01:33:51,118
They called your boss in New York.

681
01:33:51,244 --> 01:33:53,329
(French)

682
01:33:53,496 --> 01:33:55,748
Your passport, Popeye.

683
01:33:58,584 --> 01:34:01,963
Why don't you tell him
I lost it in the dry dock?

684
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:26,112
(French)

685
01:34:26,237 --> 01:34:29,782
He wants you to stay in the hotel
until we say you leave.

686
01:36:52,175 --> 01:36:54,218
(French)

687
01:36:55,011 --> 01:36:57,180
My French no good. In English.

688
01:36:57,305 --> 01:37:00,892
I say nothing till consul get here.
I know nothing of last night.

689
01:37:01,017 --> 01:37:03,686
You must have known
something was stuck to the hull.

690
01:37:03,769 --> 01:37:07,773
We come for fixing of the rudder!
I know nothing about the dope!

691
01:37:07,899 --> 01:37:11,194
- You will wait here, Captain.
- I go back in Dutch territory.

692
01:37:11,319 --> 01:37:14,822
No! You are in French territory,
and you will stay on French territory.

693
01:37:36,511 --> 01:37:39,347
I don't want to see that. Keep it under wraps.

694
01:37:40,723 --> 01:37:42,767
- What are you gonna do now?
- We wait.

695
01:37:42,892 --> 01:37:45,853
When this consul comes,
we'll go to headquarters and talk.

696
01:37:45,978 --> 01:37:49,232
And when the consul leaves,
we don't talk so much.

697
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:53,319
Don't lock this bum up yet.
He hasn't been paid.

698
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:57,740
Charnier would only pay after delivery.
Last night there wasn't time.

699
01:37:57,865 --> 01:38:00,409
This Dutchman will wait till he gets his cash.

700
01:38:00,535 --> 01:38:05,081
- It could be in Holland, on deposit in Geneva.
- No, it'll be here, and in cash.

701
01:38:05,331 --> 01:38:08,876
Charnier won't stiff this guy.
He's got too many stories to tell ya.

702
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:11,337
- I don't know.
- Look.

703
01:38:12,088 --> 01:38:15,091
If you follow this guy
all over Europe, in a week's time...

704
01:38:15,216 --> 01:38:17,927
..there'll be nickel and dime bags
on 126th Street.

705
01:38:18,052 --> 01:38:20,721
Let him go. Let him walk away.

706
01:38:22,306 --> 01:38:24,809
He'll lead us right to Frog One.

707
01:38:34,193 --> 01:38:36,237
You owe me one.

708
01:38:55,631 --> 01:38:57,675
OK, merci.

709
01:39:06,559 --> 01:39:10,938
We've got the harbour covered,
in case he tries a rendezvous by boat.

710
01:39:12,899 --> 01:39:16,903
- When's that ship scheduled to leave?
- The day after tomorrow.

711
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,574
OK.

712
01:40:04,075 --> 01:40:07,745
It will get very difficult
if we see nothing tomorrow, Popeye.

713
01:42:11,619 --> 01:42:13,663
Hey, look. Look!

714
01:42:22,755 --> 01:42:26,050
Who in the hell does that
look like? Henry Kissinger?

715
01:42:33,391 --> 01:42:35,434
(French)

716
01:42:36,727 --> 01:42:39,730
- Alexandre, Raoul, Émil...
- Come on!

717
01:43:43,211 --> 01:43:45,254
They're comin' in.

718
01:43:47,673 --> 01:43:49,801
(ship's horn)

719
01:44:06,776 --> 01:44:08,903
- Hey, there he is.
- Which one?

720
01:44:10,196 --> 01:44:14,534
The guy with the cigarette in his mouth.
They switched bags!

721
01:44:15,076 --> 01:44:17,537
The white collar. He's got a white collar.

722
01:44:17,662 --> 01:44:20,081
(French)

723
01:44:21,207 --> 01:44:24,836
Tell 'em he's got a white-and-blue bag
around his shoulder.

724
01:44:28,965 --> 01:44:31,884
- Getting ready to cross the street.
- (French)

725
01:44:57,493 --> 01:44:58,911
Oui.

726
01:44:59,453 --> 01:45:01,372
(French)

727
01:45:52,298 --> 01:45:55,343
- (French)
- Christ, look at this.

728
01:46:03,559 --> 01:46:06,229
(# "La Marseillaise")

729
01:46:30,628 --> 01:46:32,964
(French)

730
01:47:13,463 --> 01:47:15,506
(French)

731
01:47:53,878 --> 01:47:55,296
He goes to the Arab quarter.

732
01:48:08,351 --> 01:48:09,685
(French)

733
01:49:58,586 --> 01:50:00,630
Over here!

734
01:50:03,841 --> 01:50:05,009
(gunshots)

735
01:50:08,805 --> 01:50:11,474
(machine-gun fire)

736
01:50:14,811 --> 01:50:16,437
Doyle!

737
01:50:18,981 --> 01:50:20,608
(shouting)

738
01:50:25,613 --> 01:50:27,031
(shouts)

739
01:50:36,249 --> 01:50:38,584
(machine-gun fire)

740
01:51:47,528 --> 01:51:49,572
(French)

741
01:53:37,013 --> 01:53:38,806
(car horn)

742
01:53:42,185 --> 01:53:44,729
(car horn)

743
01:53:48,232 --> 01:53:50,276
Get out of the way. Get out.

744
01:54:02,121 --> 01:54:04,165
Come on, move it. Come on!

745
01:57:35,084 --> 01:57:37,211
(ship's horn)

746
01:57:37,587 --> 01:57:41,090
(radio message in French)

747
01:57:47,472 --> 01:57:50,266
(ship's horn)

748
01:57:52,685 --> 01:57:54,854
(laboured breathing)

749
01:57:56,063 --> 01:57:58,232
Charnier?
