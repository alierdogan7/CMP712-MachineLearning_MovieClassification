00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:07,377
<i>(male announcer)</i>
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

2
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:09,626
<i>the people are represented</i>
<i>by two separate</i>

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,405
<i>yet equally important groups--</i>

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,172
<i>The police</i>
<i>who investigate crime</i>

5
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:16,029
<i>and the District Attorneys</i>
<i>who prosecute the offenders.</i>

6
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:17,762
<i>These are their stories.</i>

7
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:22,415
- I put the new budget
on your desk.

8
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:23,957
- Stay out of my office,
Caroline.

9
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:25,128
- Charles.

10
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:27,357
- Anything you have for me,
give it to Amy.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,571
- I'm sure you understand
my position.

12
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,883
- You obviously
don't understand mine.

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,857
- You can't
seriously expect me to.

14
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:36,472
- What I expect
is a little consideration.

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,007
Good night,
Caroline.

16
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,469
- Guy going out to get pampers
for his kid

17
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:47,819
called it in from his cell.

18
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:49,486
We got a canvass started.

19
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,852
So far, no witnesses.

20
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,435
- [sighs] All right,
let's see.

21
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:56,917
- Looks like knife wounds
from the back.

22
00:00:56,982 --> 00:00:58,795
- Ruined a pretty good suit.

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,504
Crockett and Jones wingtips--

24
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,819
obviously not
from the neighborhood.

25
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:05,855
- No wallet.

26
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:07,894
Just a business card case here.

27
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,138
- "Charles Whitley.

28
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,705
Executive Director
of the Boland Initiative."

29
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:13,975
Pretty big charity.

30
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:16,093
- Yeah, they got 100 bucks
off me last year.

31
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:17,231
Hey, check this out.

32
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:19,109
Ligature marks on his wrists.

33
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:20,939
Somebody had him tied up.

34
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:22,654
- What's this?

35
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:24,483
It's not a tattoo.

36
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,621
It looks like fresh ink.

37
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:27,933
- A bank account, password.

38
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:29,200
- One thing I know for sure,

39
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:31,977
it's definitely
not his lucky number.

40
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:38,314
[dramatic music]

41
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:46,432
# #

42
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:25,044
- Charles was usually
home by 7:00.

43
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:28,829
I thought he'd stopped to have
a drink with a colleague.

44
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:30,592
I fell asleep.

45
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:33,140
When I woke up
and he wasn't home...

46
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:36,073
- You have any idea
why he'd be up in Inwood?

47
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:38,045
- No.

48
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,450
Was this a robbery?

49
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:42,760
- Maybe.
He ever mention any threats?

50
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,059
Or people following him?

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,047
- No, nothing like that.

52
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,915
- Executive Director
at the Boland Initiative--

53
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,277
What did that involve?

54
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:53,293
- He oversaw
their philanthropic projects.

55
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:56,563
- Your husband, did he talk
about problems at the office?

56
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:59,272
- No, he loved his work.

57
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:03,056
He even turned down
a generous retirement package.

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,101
- He had this
written on his arm.

59
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:07,738
See?

60
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:11,682
That mean anything to you?

61
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:14,327
- It's not like Charles
to do that.

62
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:17,164
That doesn't even
look like his handwriting.

63
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:21,540
- Contusions
on his limbs and torso,

64
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:23,945
bruised ribs,
welts on the back of his legs,

65
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:27,087
all leading up
to the <i>tercio de muerte.</i>

66
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,804
- The final act
of a bullfight.

67
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:30,808
- Five stab wounds
to the right lower back.

68
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:32,041
- That's a nice cluster.

69
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:33,388
Might be somebody
with training.

70
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:34,814
- What do you make of
the numbers on his forearm?

71
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,448
- It was applied
with a regular pen

72
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:38,597
not more than a day
before you found him.

73
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:40,632
As for the numbers themselves,

74
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,603
I've seen this before.

75
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:43,711
[beep]

76
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:45,716
Survivors from Auschwitz--

77
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,190
The only death camp
where prisoners

78
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:49,724
were tattooed
with serial numbers.

79
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:53,474
- Maybe someone put this number
on his arm as a message.

80
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,607
- Anti-Semitic threats?
Charles wasn't Jewish.

81
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,917
- well, maybe somebody thought
the Boland Initiative

82
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:02,194
Was too sympathetic
to Jewish causes.

83
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:03,364
- That would surprise me.

84
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:04,838
We spread the money around
very equally.

85
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:07,084
- Do you spread any of it
up in Inwood?

86
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,517
- We have grant recipients
all over the city.

87
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,785
But I spoke with Charles
yesterday.

88
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,965
He didn't mention
going to Inwood.

89
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,794
- His wife said he was
offered a retirement package.

90
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,299
- That was pro forma.

91
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:19,280
When Charles turned 62, he was
eligible for early retirement.

92
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:21,957
We were relieved
when he decided to stay on.

93
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:23,898
- Mrs. Reeves,
your conference call.

94
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,468
- Oh, excuse me.

95
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,640
- This is all of Mr. Whitley's
personal correspondence.

96
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:30,674
- Thank you.
- I see his date book

97
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:33,784
has every other Tuesday blocked
off between 5:00 and 6:00.

98
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,420
- That's right.
I'd call a car for him

99
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,826
for a 4:15 pickup,
and off he'd go.

100
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:39,026
- Off he'd go where?

101
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,799
- I never asked,
and he never told me.

102
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,085
I just told the dispatcher
to take Mr. Whitley as directed.

103
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,969
- NYPD.
Can we come in?

104
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,164
- Oh, sure.

105
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:55,648
You must be here about
the murder down the street.

106
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,786
- [murmurs]

107
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,464
- Let me put up
some fennel tea for you.

108
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:01,195
It's great for the digestion.

109
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,038
- We're good.
You were here last night?

110
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,768
Ms...?
- Lorraine Flockhart.

111
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:06,179
Yes, I was.

112
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:08,406
- A car service sent--
oops, sorry.

113
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:11,018
Uh, a car service
said that they dropped

114
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,796
the victim off
at this address.

115
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,968
- Oh, my God!

116
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:16,034
It's Charles Whitley.

117
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:18,534
He was one of my clients.

118
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,185
-You were his nutritionist?

119
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,117
- Yes, I was.

120
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:27,332
He had a standing appointment
here for years.

121
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:29,207
- How did he seem yesterday?

122
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:33,438
- He said he was
a bit run-down, actually.

123
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:36,018
I reviewed
his glycemic index

124
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,160
and we made some changes
to his diet.

125
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:42,110
And then he left,
just after 6:00.

126
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:45,409
- He had this written
on his left forearm.

127
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:47,620
- Sorry.

128
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:50,025
He had his jacket on
the whole time.

129
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,532
- There are
plenty of nutritionists

130
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,040
near his office in midtown.

131
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,139
You sure this
wasn't about sex?

132
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:59,687
- We didn't get that vibe.
- Because?

133
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:01,050
- The woman's practically
as old as his wife.

134
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:02,812
What would be the point?

135
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:06,002
- I can't believe
you said that, detective.

136
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,427
- What?

137
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,169
- I can't believe it, either.

138
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:12,780
[phone ringing]

139
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,592
- Van Buren.

140
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:16,594
Yes, put her through.

141
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,261
- You want this closed?

142
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:20,136
- This is Lieutenant Van Buren.

143
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,180
Yes, that's our case.

144
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,976
Of course we're interested.

145
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,117
- It arrived at
the metro desk this morning.

146
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,456
No return address, no note.

147
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:33,867
This is a copy.

148
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:36,238
When I saw that Whitley
was on this, I called you.

149
00:06:36,303 --> 00:06:37,473
- Let's play it.

150
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,242
[click]

151
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:48,560
- Bring the prisoner here.
- On your knees.

152
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,099
- Yes, Fraulein Vera.

153
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:54,120
- Hey, hey. It's Lorraine,
the nutritionist.

154
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:55,450
- Lick her boots, you scum.
[whip noise]

155
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,555
- Oh.

156
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,765
- Talk about
your low calorie diet.

157
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:01,233
- [grunts]

158
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:04,438
- You didn't say please.

159
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:06,776
- May I please
lick your boot, fraulein?

160
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,844
- Lick it clean.

161
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:10,494
And don't
get your lice on her.

162
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:12,096
[whipping noise]
[click]

163
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:16,902
- What I do
is completely legal.

164
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,882
Mr. Whitley got exactly
the treatment

165
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:21,580
he paid for and agreed to.

166
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:23,086
- Getting abused
as a prisoner,

167
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,457
the number on his arm--
that was all his idea?

168
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:28,260
- Yes. Don't ask me why.

169
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:31,337
- Maybe providing
S&M services is legal,

170
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,803
but making
blackmail videos isn't.

171
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,974
- I didn't spend 15 years
building a reputation

172
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,985
just to ruin it
by blackmailing a client.

173
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,423
- This was shot
in your office.

174
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:43,992
- Without my knowledge.

175
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:46,171
Charles came over
two weeks ago.

176
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:47,532
He was furious.

177
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,207
He said that someone
had sent a DVD to his work

178
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:51,921
and now they
were trying to fire him.

179
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:54,019
- So if you didn't
make the video, who did?

180
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,358
Maybe one of your...elves.

181
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:58,856
- They didn't know
where Charles worked.

182
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:00,795
- Okay.

183
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:03,534
So last Tuesday...

184
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,704
why did he come over?

185
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:06,739
- For his usual session.

186
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,148
- After being videoed?

187
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:11,929
- I fired my two girls.
We moved to a different room.

188
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,268
He needed this.

189
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,701
He couldn't stop.

190
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,908
- Somebody sends a DVD
to Whitley's boss

191
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:23,510
to try to get him fired

192
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,521
a month after he was
offered a retirement package.

193
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,363
- Which he turned down.

194
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:30,703
- Somebody wanted him
out of that job badly.

195
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:33,763
- They got him
out of that job now...badly.

196
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,788
- I didn't tell you
about the DVD

197
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:40,589
because I didn't want
to embarrass Charles' family.

198
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,263
- Do you have the DVD
and the envelope it came in?

199
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:44,896
- No, on the advice
of our council,

200
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:46,703
those materials were destroyed.

201
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:48,242
- Why?

202
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:50,818
Wouldn't you need the DVD if you
were trying to fire Mr. Whitley?

203
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:52,577
- Charles refused to resign

204
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:54,179
and he threatened
to sue if we fired him.

205
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,483
He was completely unapologetic.

206
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:58,228
He said he
wasn't breaking any laws,

207
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:01,092
that this was
his private hobby,

208
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,189
and it didn't
impact his duties here.

209
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,870
Our lawyers said
he had a strong case

210
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:06,503
if we tried
to terminate him.

211
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:07,831
- So you just let it drop.

212
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,599
What about the retirement offer?
Whose idea was that?

213
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,745
- I told you
that was pro forma.

214
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,544
- Anyone in particular
in or out of the Initiative

215
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,385
who wanted Whitley gone?

216
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,282
- No, he was respected.

217
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:22,921
That is, before that DVD
landed on my desk.

218
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,962
- I didn't know how to tell you

219
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:29,020
about Charles' predilection.

220
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:33,501
I asked him once
to explain it to me.

221
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:34,828
He couldn't.

222
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:37,373
- Did he tell you a video
of one of his sessions

223
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,566
was sent
to Boland Initiative?

224
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:41,503
- Yes, they weren't
after money.

225
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:44,416
They wanted
to hurt him professionally.

226
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:49,680
I have to call my children

227
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:51,120
before they hear
about this on the news.

228
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:52,321
- Of course.

229
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:54,866
We're very sorry.
Thank you for coming in.

230
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,498
- That is gonna
be one awkward phone call.

231
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:03,876
- At both ends.

232
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:06,434
What did you find
at the nutritionist's place?

233
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,978
- Enough leather
to outfit a biker convention,

234
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:10,307
but no spy cam.

235
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:12,579
- So it must've been
an inside job.

236
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:16,180
Take a run at
the nutritionist's little elves.

237
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:19,221
- <i>jawohl.</i>
- [chuckles]

238
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:23,493
- Yes! That's me.

239
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:26,261
It's not like I'm a prostitute.

240
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,556
It's just acting.

241
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:29,156
- It's not
what you were doing,

242
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,427
but how it got on the DVD.

243
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:33,508
- I told Lorraine
I had nothing to do with that,

244
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,203
and she still fired me.

245
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,803
And I'm about to be evicted

246
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:39,012
and I got, like,
$100 to my name.

247
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:42,467
- Did you just get
some work done, Vera?

248
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:44,515
- They're too high, right?

249
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,913
No, they're gonna look normal
when the implants settle.

250
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,514
- You didn't have them
on the video.

251
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:51,345
Where'd you get
the money for them?

252
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,555
- My savings?

253
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:54,627
- Uh-huh, okay.

254
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:56,353
So money you saved
over months?

255
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:57,857
Is that what
we're gonna find

256
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,088
when we check
your bank account?

257
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,384
- Or if we call your doctor,

258
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,160
is he gonna tell us
that you paid cash?

259
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,223
- You know, Vera,
if you paid for those

260
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:08,734
with money you got from planting
a camera in Lorraine's place,

261
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,166
the government can seize them

262
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,701
as proceeds from a crime.

263
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,230
They'll just
put you under a knife

264
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:17,005
and take them out.

265
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,677
- You can't be serious.

266
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:21,037
- As serious as murder,

267
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:23,581
which is what happened
to the gentleman in the video.

268
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:24,941
- Charlie?

269
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:26,812
Oh, my God!

270
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:28,140
- If you cooperate with us,

271
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:32,013
We can make sure
that you keep your, um...

272
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:33,854
enhancements.

273
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,852
- [sighs]

274
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:39,420
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

275
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:41,469
Wait, wait, wait.
- It's behind the cocoa puffs.

276
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,131
- Just stand over there.

277
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:46,425
- I swear I had nothing
to do with any murder!

278
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,602
The guy gave me 10 grand
to put that in Lorraine's place,

279
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,201
and that's all I did.
- Which guy?

280
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,167
- His name is Phil.

281
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:54,969
I met him outside of Lorraine's.

282
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:57,576
He said he was looking
for some restaurant,

283
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,215
and after we hooked up
at his hotel a few times,

284
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,237
he asked me to plant the camera
the next time Charlie came by.

285
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,812
He paid me and I never heard
from him again.

286
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,908
- Well, how do we find Phil?

287
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,588
- I don't know.

288
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:13,859
I went to the hotel
and he checked out.

289
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:15,778
The hotel said
that he paid cash.

290
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,347
- Did he have a phone number?

291
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:19,185
- It stopped working
so I threw it out.

292
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:21,552
- The hotel is the only place
you ever saw him?

293
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:24,895
- I saw him using an ATM around
the corner from the hotel,

294
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,199
and he looked at me like
I caught him stealing money.

295
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:31,261
So...
- Hmm?

296
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:33,069
- Are you gonna
let me keep them now?

297
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,805
- We'll be in touch.

298
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,237
- That's some
nice police work, fellas.

299
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,675
You found me through an ATM?

300
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:44,747
- You recognize her?
- [clears throat]

301
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:46,314
[chuckles]

302
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:47,642
I was in a nice hotel.

303
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,049
Expense account.

304
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:50,504
I just wanted
a no-strings-attached fling,

305
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:51,638
no crime in that.

306
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,238
- No crime so far.

307
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,982
- You know what
she does for a living?

308
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,773
She's a dominatrix.

309
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:58,517
A nut job.

310
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,723
I got a weakness
for crazy girls.

311
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,482
That's why
I love them and run.

312
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,480
- She's connected to a murder
victim named Charles Whitley.

313
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:05,984
You know who he is?

314
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,056
- No.

315
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,048
- He's one of Vera's clients.

316
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,014
She said you paid her $10,000

317
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,582
to get compromising
video of him.

318
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:13,517
- She said that?

319
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,958
That's the thing
about crazy girls--

320
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:16,589
they make trouble if
they don't get what they want.

321
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:18,301
- You're right about that.

322
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,003
How about you tell us where you
were last Tuesday around 6:00?

323
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,761
- And how about I don't?

324
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:24,458
I'm a security professional,
guys.

325
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,328
I know my rights.
- Sure.

326
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:27,496
We'll get out of your way.

327
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,000
Just curious...

328
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:31,639
how did you get
into the security business?

329
00:13:31,703 --> 00:13:33,542
- Personal interest.

330
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:39,266
My older sister was killed
by a stalker in college.

331
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:41,376
You have a nice ride
back to the city.

332
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:46,510
- Your witness is a woman
who beats up men for a living.

333
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,215
If that's your probable cause,
it won't impress a judge.

334
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,972
- Well, Amato said he
was in the city on a job.

335
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,253
His boss said
he was on vacation.

336
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,588
- Well, Vera said
Amato gave her $10,000

337
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:55,579
to plant the camera.

338
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:56,874
Does he have
that kind of money?

339
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,777
- No, he's
moonlighting for someone

340
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:00,282
who wanted Whitley
out of the way.

341
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:02,183
- That's not enough
probable cause for murder,

342
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:04,489
but it may be enough
for an extortion charge.

343
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,456
Talk to a judge
about a search warrant.

344
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,596
- Hey, what do we have here?

345
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:15,890
A program to operate
remote cameras.

346
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,552
- Yeah,
that's standard equipment

347
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:19,330
in the security business,
big deal.

348
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:21,568
- Let's turn one on
and see what we come up with.

349
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,527
- Looks like the property room
at our precinct.

350
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:31,340
- Which is where we stored
the camera that Vera gave us--

351
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:34,107
The camera she says
you gave her.

352
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,300
You're under arrest
for extortion.

353
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,339
Hook him up.

354
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:39,403
- Vera set me up.

355
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:41,303
- Hey b, check this out.
- She set me up!

356
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,375
- It's a letter
of recommendation

357
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:43,607
for our friend here,

358
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:45,605
addressed to the Halliwell
Group, dated last year.

359
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:47,380
Check out the signature
at the bottom.

360
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:50,242
- Rita Shalvoy.

361
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:51,618
- Governor's wife.

362
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,177
No wonder he's so cocky.
The guy's got juice.

363
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:55,681
- Oops.

364
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:59,024
We just stepped
into a deep, stinking pile.

365
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:04,803
- According to her
letter of recommendation,

366
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:07,731
Rita Shalvoy met
Bobby Amato 13 years ago,

367
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:09,538
when his sister was killed.

368
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:11,728
- Rita was a victims'
rights advocate back then.

369
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,001
What was his sister's name?

370
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:15,232
- Ellie. Ellie Amato.

371
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:16,640
- Ellie's law.
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:18,112
The anti-stalking statute.

373
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:19,566
- Rita fought
to make that happen.

374
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:21,038
- You know
what a fighter she is.

375
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:23,037
And how corrupt
the husband is.

376
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:25,373
- Start by finding out
who Mr. Amato is working for.

377
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,372
I'll talk to Rita Shalvoy.

378
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:29,580
Just to give her a heads up

379
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:32,378
that we're charging
her friend with extortion.

380
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:37,882
- Your boss told us you weren't
working for him in New York.

381
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:40,024
You were freelancing
for someone else.

382
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:41,446
- There is no someone else.

383
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:42,853
I did a job for Halliwell,

384
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,956
then I decided to stay in town
and enjoy the sights.

385
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:47,251
- The sights?

386
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,186
From where? Zagat's guide
to S&M dungeons?

387
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:50,899
- Well, yeah, I want
to tell you about that.

388
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:52,721
- Mr. Amato--
- It's okay.

389
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:54,192
I was up in Inwood,

390
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:56,622
I was looking for a Dominican
restaurant when I met Vera.

391
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,630
After we hooked up, she told me
what she did for a living.

392
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:03,069
She said she was worried
about this client of hers,

393
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,973
this creep, she thought
he was stalking her.

394
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:07,371
I told her that my sister
had been killed by a stalker

395
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:09,034
and that I would
follow him for her

396
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,442
to put her mind at ease.

397
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:13,032
- An act of gallantry
toward a woman you were dating

398
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:16,438
under a pseudonym
and planning to dump?

399
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:19,141
- Did I mention that
following people is fun?

400
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:21,270
I told Vera
where he lived and worked

401
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:22,918
in case she
needed to protect herself.

402
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,981
Then she has
the nerve to turn on me

403
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,412
and set me up
with this extortion rap.

404
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:28,578
- So you're saying she planted

405
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:30,386
spy cam software
in your computer?

406
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:31,986
- No.

407
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,185
That would be ridiculous.

408
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,223
I gave her the camera
so I could watch her.

409
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:39,327
She liked to put on little shows
for me on her computer,

410
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,126
but then she made a video
of Whitley and framed me for it.

411
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,653
- You sure you
didn't leave anything out?

412
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:46,523
- No, that
just about covers it.

413
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,298
- Except Vera
never mentioned her worries

414
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:49,930
about Whitley to the police.

415
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:52,266
- Oh, no, she was
definitely concerned.

416
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:53,994
The guy was twisted.

417
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:55,096
And hyped up on coke.

418
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:57,432
- Drugs now.
- That's what she said.

419
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:00,262
He went to a dinner a few months
ago in honor of Jimmy Carter

420
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:03,797
and he spent the whole night in
the bathroom with a bloody nose.

421
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,244
That's a guy with a problem
right there.

422
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,403
- I'm sorry to hear
about Bobby Amato.

423
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:15,106
He's never recovered
from his sister's death.

424
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:17,410
Can I get you some coffee?

425
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:18,644
- I'm fine, Rita.

426
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:20,882
- I appreciate the heads up.

427
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:24,786
Come what may, Jack,
when this election's over,

428
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:28,290
I hope you and I are able to
find a way to be friends again.

429
00:17:28,354 --> 00:17:31,969
- You know me,
I'm an optimist by nature.

430
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,826
But wouldn't Donald object?

431
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:36,399
- Donald's had ample
proof of my loyalty.

432
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:41,199
And with our youngest
going off to boarding school,

433
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:44,767
there's an opportunity for me
to reengage with the world.

434
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:47,278
- Well, you can't keep
a good woman down.

435
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:49,181
Back to Bobby Amato.

436
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:52,077
You wrote a pretty glowing
recommendation for him.

437
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:53,914
How well do you know him?

438
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:55,179
- I should've known
you wouldn't come

439
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:57,305
all this way
for a courtesy call.

440
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:03,190
The fight for Ellie's law
gave Bobby a purpose.

441
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:05,814
He became attached to me.

442
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,987
He's loyal to a fault.

443
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,588
- The fault being?

444
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,284
- [sighs]

445
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:13,152
A few years ago,
he called me.

446
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,218
I was on my way to Maine
to visit my mom who was ill.

447
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:19,921
Two days later,
Bobby shows up--

448
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:23,966
in Maine, car full of groceries,
ready to pitch in and help.

449
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:27,101
I had to explain why
his behavior was inappropriate.

450
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,628
He apologized and left.

451
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:32,764
- Sounds like you need Ellie's
law to protect you from him.

452
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,379
- You ever have a cat, Jack?

453
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:40,411
They'll bring you mice
they've killed

454
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,443
as a gift--

455
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:45,021
A kind of unsolicited
act of devotion.

456
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,659
Bobby's like that.

457
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,625
- In December,
there was a dinner

458
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:55,227
honoring President Carter--

459
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,489
an intimate dinner for 30
at the Shalvoys' townhouse,

460
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,025
and it was on a Tuesday.

461
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,160
- Whitley went there

462
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,969
straight from one
of his S&M sessions.

463
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:06,503
If he was in the bathroom
tending to a bloody nose--

464
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:08,167
- Rita Shalvoy would've known.

465
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,860
- She might've been the one who
told Bobby Amato what happened.

466
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:16,405
- Meaning she sicced Amato
on Charles Whitley.

467
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:18,245
- Whatever Rita's motive,
she's already laid out

468
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,675
a preemptive defense
for herself.

469
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:23,251
She accused Amato
of stalking her

470
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:25,410
and doing unsolicited favors.

471
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:28,819
Rita Shalvoy
and Charles Whitley.

472
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,721
Connect the dots.

473
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:34,690
- The invitation
to the Carter dinner

474
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,225
was sent to
the Boland Initiative.

475
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:38,128
Charles happened
to be free that night.

476
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:40,129
- Do you know if he had
any kind of relationship

477
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:41,392
with Rita Shalvoy?

478
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:42,960
- No, he never mentioned her.

479
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:44,223
- What about a relationship

480
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,431
between Rita Shalvoy
and the Boland Initiative?

481
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:48,495
- The Shalvoys have
attended some of our functions,

482
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,367
but there was no relationship.

483
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,839
- What about you,
Ms. Reeves?

484
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:54,942
Did you ever talk to Rita
Shalvoy about Charles Whitley?

485
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:57,216
Maybe complain about him?

486
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,414
- No, what a strange question.

487
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,446
- Well, you offered him
the retirement package.

488
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:04,206
You were sent the DVD.

489
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,342
You tried to fire him.

490
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:08,446
This campaign to get rid
of Mr. Whitley--

491
00:20:08,526 --> 00:20:10,285
if it didn't come from you

492
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:11,949
it certainly came through you.

493
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:14,317
- That is completely untrue.

494
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:16,364
I knew Charles
for almost 20 years.

495
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:17,997
I never wished him any harm.

496
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:21,932
- She left her office a half
an hour after you talked to her

497
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:23,995
and took a cab
to Hudson River Park.

498
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,595
- She looks kind of familiar.

499
00:20:25,662 --> 00:20:26,941
- Yeah, it's Thea Curry,

500
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:29,837
City Councilwoman
from District 52.

501
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,772
She spoke
at my niece's graduation.

502
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:33,610
Impressive.

503
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:36,908
Whatever you said to Ms. Reeves,
you got to her.

504
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:38,474
- They're lovers?

505
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,586
- Not to mention Caroline
Reeves is married.

506
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,442
- Half an hour
after she talks to us,

507
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:45,753
Caroline Reeves is crying
on Thea Curry's shoulder.

508
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:49,656
We should remind Councilwoman
Curry she has an obligation

509
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,793
to report any criminal
activity to us.

510
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,361
- I'm aware of my
ethical obligations, Mr. Cutter,

511
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,135
As I'm sure
you're aware of yours.

512
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:03,559
Whatever your detective saw
is nobody's business.

513
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:07,240
- Right, nobody's business,
of course.

514
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:09,335
And Ms. Reeves
is a lovely woman.

515
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,239
- Well, I could put
in a good word for you,

516
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,407
but it wouldn't do any good.

517
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,720
She's married.

518
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:18,215
- Isn't this the school
the Obamas

519
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,622
considered for their girls--

520
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:21,013
Georgetown Day School?

521
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:22,758
- I think it was.

522
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,286
- Are you thinking of it
for your kids?

523
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,548
You're moving to Washington?

524
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:29,717
- No, my husband
and I have shared custody,

525
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:33,462
and he's had job offers,
so we're just...

526
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,796
you never know.
- Right.

527
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,333
Yeah, you don't.

528
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,235
The people
at Georgetown Day School

529
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,411
say Thea Curry visited twice.

530
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:46,611
She told them that she was the
one who might be moving to D.C.,

531
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:47,844
not her ex-husband.

532
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:49,379
- So why lie about it?

533
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:51,378
- She's a smart politician.

534
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,387
Everyone expects her
to run for State office,

535
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,273
maybe even for Congress.

536
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,985
Of course.

537
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,352
It's been staring us
in the face.

538
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:10,225
New York has
an open U.S. Senate seat.

539
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,528
Governor Shalvoy
can appoint whoever he wants

540
00:22:14,593 --> 00:22:16,273
to fill that vacancy.

541
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:19,566
- If there's something
in it for him.

542
00:22:19,632 --> 00:22:21,934
- Does a bear crap
in the woods?

543
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:25,806
- Meanwhile, Thea Curry's
lover, Caroline Reeves,

544
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:29,246
tries to coax Charles Whitley
into early retirement.

545
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,086
- When that didn't work,

546
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:35,053
Rita's "loyal-to-a-fault"
private spy

547
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,862
dug up the dirt on Whitley
to force him out of his job.

548
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,686
- That's the horse trade.

549
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:42,191
Thea Curry becomes Senator

550
00:22:42,255 --> 00:22:44,558
and Rita Shalvoy
becomes Executive Director

551
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:46,733
of a prestigious
international charity.

552
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,270
- The Shalvoys are running
a big game of musical chairs.

553
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,543
- And Charles Whitley
didn't want to give up his seat.

554
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:54,301
But it's still not clear

555
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:58,077
if Amato killed Whitley
on Rita Shalvoy's orders

556
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,109
or what the Governor knows
about his wife's involvement.

557
00:23:00,174 --> 00:23:01,918
- We'll have to find out,
won't we?

558
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:05,519
- If Shalvoy goes down,
he takes Joe Chappell with him.

559
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,286
- That's not a factor
in how we prosecute this case.

560
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,860
- Don't look so happy, Jack.

561
00:23:24,395 --> 00:23:26,521
- Rita Shalvoy described
you as a quasi-stalker

562
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:28,489
who did her favors
she never asked for.

563
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,600
- No, Mrs. Shalvoy
would never say that.

564
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:31,960
- She told us about the time

565
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:33,767
you brought groceries
up to Maine.

566
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,736
- You see what she's doing,
Bobby?

567
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:38,663
Whatever you did to Whitley,
she never asked you to do it.

568
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,200
We're sending you to prison.

569
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:43,577
She's greasing the skids.

570
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,335
- Is there a plea offer here?

571
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:46,616
- Manslaughter.

572
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:48,904
But first we hear
what he has to say.

573
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,598
- Mrs. Shalvoy
wanted my help

574
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:06,789
forcing Whitley out
of the Boland Initiative.

575
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:10,532
She told me about his nosebleed
at the Jimmy Carter dinner.

576
00:24:10,598 --> 00:24:13,173
She said I'd have no trouble
finding something on him.

577
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:14,597
- Did she pay you?

578
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,934
- She gave me
a Diamond necklace.

579
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,534
Told me where I could sell it.

580
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:21,174
I got 20 grand for it.

581
00:24:21,238 --> 00:24:23,781
I used ten to pay Vera
to make the DVD.

582
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,844
Two weeks after I sent
the DVD to Caroline Reeves,

583
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,477
Mrs. Shalvoy called me.

584
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:31,445
She said
Whitley was being stubborn,

585
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:34,661
and would I remove him?

586
00:24:34,726 --> 00:24:39,394
Mrs. Shalvoy said he
was standing in her way

587
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:41,395
of doing great things.

588
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,323
She reminded me
of all the good she'd done.

589
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:46,497
Ellie's Law.

590
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:51,537
And how could
I turn my back on her now?

591
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:53,409
So I did what she asked.

592
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:57,344
- Did she say
anything to indicate

593
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:00,449
if Governor Shalvoy
knew what she was up to?

594
00:25:00,513 --> 00:25:02,017
- No, she never
mentioned him once.

595
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:07,983
- It's hard to believe
Rita Shalvoy would go so far

596
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,583
off the reservation without
her husband knowing about it.

597
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:13,022
- When it
comes to the Shalvoys,

598
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:15,552
I've suspended disbelief
a long while ago.

599
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,487
How much of Amato's story
can we corroborate?

600
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,087
- Well, we talked
to the jeweler

601
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,164
who bought Rita's necklace
from Amato.

602
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:26,460
He resold it to a tourist
from Qatar for cash.

603
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,173
There's no way to track it down.

604
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:31,165
- That necklace
could've belonged to anybody.

605
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,436
It's gonna take more than
the word of an accused killer

606
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:35,374
to convict the Governor's wife.

607
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:37,917
- Amato offered
to wear a wire...

608
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:39,548
if we can get Rita
into a room with him.

609
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:43,420
- This woman
wasn't born yesterday.

610
00:25:45,726 --> 00:25:48,860
Have Amato's lawyer
move for a bail hearing.

611
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,228
- I'm not
asserting a privilege,

612
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:54,956
I just don't understand
why I've been called

613
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,428
to testify at a bail hearing.

614
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:58,957
- I subpoenaed her to address
my client's <i>Bona Fides</i>

615
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:00,365
for release on bail.

616
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,173
She's known him
for a dozen years

617
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:04,573
and can testify to
the likelihood he'll appear.

618
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:07,645
- I don't want to hurt
Mr. Amato's chances for bail,

619
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,908
but I'm not
going to address that.

620
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:11,148
- Can I speak
to Mrs. Shalvoy in private?

621
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:13,580
- That's highly irregular,
your honor.

622
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,948
- Please, Judge,
just give him a chance

623
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:17,308
to convince her to cooperate.

624
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:20,012
- Your client has ten minutes.

625
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:33,164
- You've put me in a
really awkward position, Bobby.

626
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:35,660
- Why aren't you helping me,
Mrs. Shalvoy?

627
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,997
I'm going crazy in jail.

628
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:39,676
I've kept my mouth shut
until now.

629
00:26:39,742 --> 00:26:42,044
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

630
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,445
- I don't want to hurt you
or your family.

631
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,317
At least help me come up
with a story.

632
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:47,820
- A story?

633
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:50,412
Are you implying you murdered
Charles Whitley for me?

634
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,010
- Yeah, well, I did.

635
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,587
- Bobby, you know
that's not true.

636
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:56,681
You may have heard
me criticize Whitley,

637
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:59,561
but I never asked you
to harm him.

638
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:05,161
- I'll tell them
about the necklace.

639
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:07,433
- The necklace.

640
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:09,801
Bobby, I've told you before,

641
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:13,304
you need psychiatric help.

642
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,880
Bobby,
I've told you before,

643
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:26,186
You need psychiatric help.

644
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,881
- She didn't come close
to an admission.

645
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:31,849
- She's too smart.

646
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:34,298
[phone ringing]

647
00:27:34,364 --> 00:27:36,921
- Yes, Ida.

648
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:40,265
Tonight?

649
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,362
Tell him I'll be there.

650
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,867
I've been summoned.

651
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:51,482
- I advised Mrs. Shalvoy
that she had to report this.

652
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:54,137
She insisted on doing it
as soon as possible.

653
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:57,640
- Bobby Amato confessed
to me today

654
00:27:57,722 --> 00:27:59,320
that he killed
Charles Whitley.

655
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:02,249
As fond as I am of Bobby,

656
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,856
I'm prepared to testify
against him.

657
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:06,120
- She'll come down tomorrow

658
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,959
and give a full statement
to Mr. Cutter.

659
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:10,695
- It's the right thing
to do, Rita.

660
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:16,197
Can we have a word?

661
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:18,965
- Give us a minute, Rita?

662
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:29,572
- Rita told me that Amato might
try to drag her down with him.

663
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:33,109
- Let's not insult each other's
intelligence, okay?

664
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:36,052
We both know
what this murder was about--

665
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:37,476
the Senate seat.

666
00:28:45,428 --> 00:28:46,565
Seems like every day

667
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:50,228
we hear about
another corrupt civil servant.

668
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:54,867
Corrupt banker
or businessman, athlete.

669
00:28:57,508 --> 00:29:03,346
Seems that behind every success
story of the last ten years,

670
00:29:03,412 --> 00:29:07,106
a scandal is exploding.

671
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:10,450
We're facing a rising sea
of corruption,

672
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,386
and we wonder...

673
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:17,584
who will be
the next to be drowned?

674
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,696
Who will be saved?

675
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:26,225
And what will become
of our good works?

676
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:30,896
When will it stop, Donald,
and who will stop it?

677
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:43,374
- If you expect me...

678
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:46,574
to implicate Rita...

679
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:47,854
and jeopardize my family?

680
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:49,854
- Your family--

681
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:53,918
they're campaign props
you use to get elected.

682
00:29:53,983 --> 00:29:57,821
They mean as much to you as
balloons and bumper stickers.

683
00:29:57,885 --> 00:29:58,892
Your whoring proves it.

684
00:29:58,957 --> 00:30:00,366
- Be careful, Jack.

685
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,996
I'll attribute that to
the stress of your campaign.

686
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,923
I know you're in a dead heat
with Joe Chappell.

687
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,163
I also know
a few things about Joe.

688
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,779
Maybe we could swing
the numbers your way.

689
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:21,018
- You're trying
to buy me off?

690
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:25,449
- Well, you worry
about your good works, Jack.

691
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:28,056
How are you
going to safeguard them

692
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:29,943
if you're not
in the game anymore?

693
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:44,840
- Rita came in
and gave her statement.

694
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:47,126
She's practically
inoculated herself

695
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:48,695
against anything Bobby
might say.

696
00:30:48,776 --> 00:30:51,670
- Every time we zig,
the Shalvoys zag.

697
00:30:51,736 --> 00:30:54,374
- Then go straight at them.

698
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:56,279
Convene a Grand Jury
to investigate

699
00:30:56,344 --> 00:31:00,214
the selling of a Senate seat
by Governor Shalvoy.

700
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:02,118
Once we prove
the why of Whitley's murder,

701
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:03,655
we can prove the who.

702
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,486
- I had discussions
with Governor Shalvoy

703
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:13,397
about my possible appointment
to the U.S. Senate.

704
00:31:13,463 --> 00:31:15,333
- Did the Governor
mention his wife, Rita,

705
00:31:15,397 --> 00:31:16,963
during these discussions?

706
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:20,259
- He said his wife was looking
to get back into public service.

707
00:31:20,324 --> 00:31:22,340
He asked if I could
help her find a position.

708
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:23,603
- So was it
your understanding, then,

709
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,362
that finding
Rita Shalvoy a job

710
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:29,602
was a prerequisite to your
getting the Senate appointment?

711
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,176
- He didn't say those words,

712
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:36,512
but that's what
I read between the lines.

713
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:38,144
- So what did you do?

714
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:40,287
- I told him a friend
at the Boland Initiative

715
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:42,815
was unhappy with
their Executive Director,

716
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,655
Charles Whitley.

717
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:46,847
I said that I would look into
that situation for his wife.

718
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:48,190
- And what happened next?

719
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:50,464
- My friend
Caroline Reeves

720
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:53,359
agreed to urge
Mr. Whitley to retire.

721
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:54,559
He refused.

722
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,767
It was then
that I called the Governor

723
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,694
and told him that the Boland
job wasn't opening up.

724
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,397
- And what did
the Governor say?

725
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,437
- That he'd let me know
about the Senate appointment.

726
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:08,606
A week later,
Caroline told me

727
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,151
that Mr. Whitley
had been murdered.

728
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:16,477
- She "read between the lines."

729
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,909
I'm not sure
that makes out pay-to-play.

730
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,749
- Should be enough
for an indictment.

731
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,917
- You're asking a Grand Jury
to indict a sitting governor.

732
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:25,998
He's not exactly
a ham sandwich.

733
00:32:26,062 --> 00:32:29,052
- Shalvoy's giving an interview
about the vacant Senate seat.

734
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,701
- My only criterion
is who will best represent

735
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:34,172
the State of New York.

736
00:32:34,238 --> 00:32:35,468
Right now,
I'm leaning towards someone

737
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:37,035
I've had my disagreements
with in the past,

738
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,604
but he's seasoned enough
to handle

739
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:42,332
the rough-and-tumble world
of national politics.

740
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:45,113
Manhattan District Attorney Jack
McCoy is at the top of my list.

741
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,411
Thank you.

742
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:53,174
- Shalvoy must've found out
we convened a Grand Jury on him.

743
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,744
He's muddying the waters.

744
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,015
- Not to mention
who's going to vote for a D.A.

745
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:58,456
Who's got one eye
on Washington?

746
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:02,392
You have to admit,
it's rather brilliant.

747
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:05,191
- Ida, get me Mark
in the campaign office.

748
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:07,622
I'll put an end to it
tomorrow morning

749
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:08,855
with a press conference.

750
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:10,663
- We're wanted
in the Grand Jury.

751
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,102
- We saw the news
during the lunch break,

752
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:15,526
And some of us wondered
if Jack McCoy

753
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:17,543
might be horse-trading
with the Governor too.

754
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:19,397
- Mr. Foreman,
Jack McCoy is not

755
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:21,477
a target
of your investigation.

756
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,109
- Maybe Thea Curry
was subpoenaed

757
00:33:23,174 --> 00:33:24,836
because McCoy's trying to
whittle down his competition

758
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,213
for the Senate job.

759
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:27,540
- We'd like to hear
what he has to say about it.

760
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:28,980
- Mr. McCoy will be speaking

761
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:30,677
at a news conference
tomorrow morning.

762
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,220
- We want him under oath
when he tells his side of it.

763
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,692
- Your Grand Jury
is out of control.

764
00:33:36,757 --> 00:33:38,658
- We always claim Grand Juries
are independent.

765
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:40,995
- If it leaks out that
I've been called to appear,

766
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,787
I might as well concede
to Joe Chappell right now.

767
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:44,388
- You need to get out
in front of this

768
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:46,788
before you find your name on the
first page of an indictment.

769
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:49,794
- My campaign director
is advising me

770
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:51,426
to assert executive privilege--

771
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,729
to stall
until after the election.

772
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:55,906
- Well,
if that's your plan, Jack...

773
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,904
I'd rather you conceded.

774
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:04,639
Mr. McCoy, have you ever
sought an interim appointment

775
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:06,273
to the United States Senate?

776
00:34:06,353 --> 00:34:08,241
- Never.

777
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,224
I'm running for election
to remain the District Attorney.

778
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:15,518
I have no desire
to hold any other office.

779
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:18,384
- Have you ever discussed
the interim Senate seat

780
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:20,590
with Governor Shalvoy?

781
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:22,431
- Not as it concerns myself.

782
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:23,486
- Um...

783
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:24,862
- Yes.

784
00:34:24,928 --> 00:34:27,166
- In other words, Mr. McCoy,
you had a discussion

785
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,206
with the Governor about it.

786
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:29,470
- Yes.

787
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:30,669
- And yesterday
the Governor said

788
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,365
he was thinking
of appointing you.

789
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,766
Why shouldn't we
infer you made a deal?

790
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,308
- I convened this Grand Jury
because the police

791
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:46,477
uncovered evidence
of political corruption

792
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,213
during the investigation
of a murder.

793
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:55,452
The Governor's announcement is
a ploy to hijack your inquiry.

794
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:57,388
I never sought

795
00:34:57,455 --> 00:35:00,732
and will not accept
appointment of the Senate,

796
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:02,700
because I remain
committed to one thing:

797
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:04,268
To serve this city

798
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:07,561
as its chief
law enforcement officer.

799
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:12,634
And in that capacity,

800
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:16,011
I will prosecute
political corruption

801
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:19,706
wherever it occurs...

802
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,217
and whomever perpetrates it.

803
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:29,418
- Two hours and counting.

804
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:31,225
- I think he'll be okay.

805
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:32,955
- Don't be so sure.

806
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:35,930
That one Grand Juror was
ready to storm the barricades.

807
00:35:35,994 --> 00:35:38,458
There's a mob mentality
in this country right now.

808
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,633
None of us can afford
to be complacent.

809
00:35:40,698 --> 00:35:42,042
[bell ringing]

810
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:45,240
- Thank you.

811
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:51,670
They voted a sealed indictment
against Governor Shalvoy

812
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:54,118
for official misconduct

813
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:56,582
and attempted bribe receiving
in the second degree.

814
00:35:58,743 --> 00:35:59,812
Nothing about you.

815
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:01,879
- It's just an indictment.

816
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:02,981
They still don't
have enough evidence

817
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:04,388
to convict him in trial.

818
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,389
- It's sufficient for
what I need to do with it.

819
00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:11,700
- I will not be
sent out again, Donald.

820
00:36:11,763 --> 00:36:13,396
- Whatever you have
to say to me, Jack,

821
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:14,756
you say
in front of my wife.

822
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:16,835
- Fine.

823
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:19,235
I have a sealed indictment
against you

824
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:21,332
for bartering the Senate seat
with Thea Curry.

825
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:23,731
- I'm just curious,
what did you promise Thea

826
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:25,747
in return for
her perjured testimony?

827
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:27,202
- I'd be careful.

828
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:29,841
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

829
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:31,617
- Are you Mirandizing him?

830
00:36:31,682 --> 00:36:34,273
- I have officers outside
waiting to arrest you.

831
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:35,954
- Waiting?

832
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:37,314
What do you want from me?

833
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:39,457
- Corroboration
of Bobby Amato's testimony

834
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:42,689
against your wife
for Charles Whitley's murder.

835
00:36:42,754 --> 00:36:43,954
- Jack.

836
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:46,064
This vendetta against me
is pathological.

837
00:36:46,129 --> 00:36:48,529
- If you give me what I need,

838
00:36:48,595 --> 00:36:51,058
I might be convinced that your
conversation with Thea Curry

839
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,536
was political back-scratching

840
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,401
that didn't rise
to the level of criminality.

841
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:01,312
I'll withdraw the indictment

842
00:37:01,378 --> 00:37:06,175
as legally insufficient before
it even sees the light of day.

843
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,143
You'll keep your position,

844
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,417
your power.

845
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,214
- How can I trust you

846
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,359
- You can't seriously
be considering this, Donald.

847
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:18,318
- Never mind trust.
Do the math.

848
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:20,063
- Donald, I remind you

849
00:37:20,128 --> 00:37:22,063
that every
conversation we've had

850
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:24,031
is subject
to the spousal privilege.

851
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,630
I can stop you
from testifying against me,

852
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:28,639
just as you can stop me
from testifying against you.

853
00:37:30,735 --> 00:37:33,342
- The privilege
has exceptions.

854
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:35,565
- Yes, I know.

855
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:39,037
Did Bobby Amato
mention a necklace?

856
00:37:39,104 --> 00:37:42,684
- The Diamond necklace--
that's how Rita paid him.

857
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,573
Amato sold it to a jeweler.

858
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:46,412
- If I remember
my law classes,

859
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:48,317
it's an exception
to the privilege

860
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:50,749
if I see my wife take
a necklace out of our safe

861
00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:52,382
and put it in her purse.

862
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:55,723
A necklace our insurance company
has a picture of.

863
00:37:55,788 --> 00:37:57,500
- Jack...

864
00:37:57,565 --> 00:37:59,868
Every word out of his mouth
is a lie.

865
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:02,923
You must know that.

866
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:05,436
- Of course,
for our son's sake

867
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,740
I can't take the stand
against Rita.

868
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:09,341
- No, you wouldn't have to.

869
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:11,901
If the jeweler recognizes
the necklace from the photo,

870
00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:14,907
that corroborates
Amato's story.

871
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:16,811
- Done.

872
00:38:18,284 --> 00:38:20,556
- You bastard!

873
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,114
After I cleaned up after
you and that Brazilian whore,

874
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,714
this is how you repay me?

875
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,186
- Just suck it up, Rita.

876
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:28,764
You know, when I heard
that Whitley was killed,

877
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:30,330
I knew it had to be her.

878
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,057
She was in heat
for the Boland job.

879
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:33,528
- You're sick!

880
00:38:33,593 --> 00:38:35,993
- You wanted to be
this big humanitarian

881
00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:38,296
jetting around the globe,
saving the world.

882
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:39,993
And now look at you--

883
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:41,927
sad, pathetic.

884
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:43,064
- Shut up, Donald.

885
00:38:43,128 --> 00:38:45,432
- Jack, he's framing me.

886
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:46,712
This is what
he's always wanted

887
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:47,831
so that he could be
with his whores.

888
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:49,079
- Rita.

889
00:38:49,144 --> 00:38:50,374
- You have no idea
what it's been like

890
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,605
to live like this,

891
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,278
share a bed with him.

892
00:38:54,343 --> 00:38:55,687
- Rita, don't do this
to yourself.

893
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,148
- He owed me.
You owe me!

894
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:24,243
- When the police
were investigating

895
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:26,273
Charles Whitley's private life,
they discovered

896
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:28,945
that his dark world
overlapped yours.

897
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,369
- I doubt that.

898
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,673
I'm not one
of those S&M freaks.

899
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:33,985
- Well, maybe not,
but you'd be surprised

900
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:37,120
how often sex workers
migrate between specialties.

901
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:40,753
High-class escort one month

902
00:39:40,817 --> 00:39:43,088
may be working
in a dungeon the next.

903
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,129
And service people, they love
to gossip about their clients.

904
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:49,663
- That's old news.

905
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:51,199
I learned my lesson last year.

906
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:53,872
- Not well enough it seems.

907
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:56,735
One thing about people
like you...

908
00:39:58,304 --> 00:40:00,112
you can't stop.

909
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,638
I have names, dates,
and places.

910
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:13,981
- What do you want?

911
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:15,518
- Your resignation, Governor,

912
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,652
with your reputation--
such as it is--intact.

913
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:22,028
Just say you're leaving office
to support your wife

914
00:40:22,093 --> 00:40:26,156
and family in a time
of personal crisis.

915
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:27,836
- That wasn't the deal.

916
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,363
McCoy said I'd stay in office.

917
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,636
- I'm not Jack McCoy.

918
00:40:46,108 --> 00:40:47,977
- After my wife's arrest
on these tenuous

919
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:50,651
and politically-motivated
charges,

920
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:54,249
I find myself torn between
my obligation to my family

921
00:40:54,316 --> 00:40:56,985
and my commitment
to my constituents.

922
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:58,360
But after speaking
to one of the most

923
00:40:58,425 --> 00:40:59,690
talented minds in the state--

924
00:40:59,754 --> 00:41:01,593
Deputy Attorney General
Joe Chappell--

925
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:04,697
I realize I need
to put my family first.

926
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,305
I'm resigning as Governor
of the State of New York

927
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:08,441
effective immediately.

928
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:09,737
No further questions.

929
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:14,936
- One last shot at me

930
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,967
before the door slams
behind him.

931
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,406
I'm surprised, though.

932
00:41:22,472 --> 00:41:23,478
- About what?

933
00:41:23,543 --> 00:41:26,149
- Given the chance
to keep his job,

934
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,582
I thought he'd hold on
with both hands.

935
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:31,589
What'd you say
to him yesterday?

936
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:35,253
- I...

937
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:37,285
I told him
that I had this list

938
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:40,902
of his latest assignations
with prostitutes.

939
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,964
[paper rustles]

940
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:48,836
- I'm not sure I approve.

941
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,140
- Not sure?

942
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:54,769
I thought you wanted
to win this election.

943
00:41:56,674 --> 00:41:58,851
- Polls open
in seven hours.

944
00:42:05,616 --> 00:42:10,257
- [sighs]

945
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:12,191
May we live
to fight another day.

946
00:42:12,257 --> 00:42:13,855
- Here, here.

947
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:15,519
[clinks]

948
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:18,655
