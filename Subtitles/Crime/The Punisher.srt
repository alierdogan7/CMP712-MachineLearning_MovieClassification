00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,029
AFTER NEARLY FIVE YEARS
OF APPEALS,

2
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,531
DINO MORETTI,
REPUTED LIEUTENANT

3
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,533
OF THE FRANCO
CRIME FAMILY,

4
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,535
WAS RELEASED
FROM PRISON TODAY

5
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,036
AND ACQUITTED
OF ALL CHARGES

6
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,538
IN CONNECTION
WITH THE MURDERS

7
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,039
OF POLICE OFFICER
FRANK CASTLE

8
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,541
AND HIS FAMILY.

9
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,543
MORETTI HAS LONG
MAINTAINED HIS INNOCENCE,

10
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,546
CLAIMS HE HAS NO IDEA
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE

11
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,549
FOR THE 125 MYSTERIOUS
GANGLAND MURDERS,

12
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,051
OFTEN ATTRIBUTED
TO A SHADOWY FIGURE

13
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,553
KNOWN AS THE PUNISHER,

14
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,054
WHICH HAVE OCCURRED HERE

15
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,556
OVER THE LAST
HALF DECADE.

16
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,558
LAURIE SILVERS
HAS THIS REPORT.

17
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,559
MR. MORETTI?

18
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,562
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE FINALLY
ACQUITTED?

19
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,063
IT FEELS GREAT.

20
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,565
JUST GREAT.

21
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,567
THE GOVERNMENT
SAYS IT'S GOING
TO APPEAL.

22
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,569
LET THEM APPEAL
A HUNDRED TIMES.

23
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,070
I'LL STILL WIN.

24
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,572
THIS IS AMERICA.

25
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,074
IF A MAN IS INNOCENT,
JUSTICE PREVAILS.

26
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,577
ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THE PUNISHER?

27
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,580
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS PUNISHER,

28
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,081
WHOEVER HE IS.

29
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:39,085
IF HE EVER SHOWS UP
WITHIN 1,000 YARDS OF ME,

30
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,589
HE'LL FIND OUT WHAT
THE WORD PUNISHED
REALLY MEANS.

31
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,091
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME.

32
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,094
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

33
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,596
THE DAPPER DON,

34
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,598
ALLEGEDLY HEAD
OF THE POWERFUL
FRANCO CRIME FAMILY,

35
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,601
ONCE AGAIN SHRUGGING OFF
ANY FEAR OF THE PUNISHER

36
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,104
DESPITE THE FACT
THAT OVER 125
ORGANIZED CRIME FIGURES

37
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,107
HAVE BEEN MURDERED
BY THE SELF-STYLED
VIGILANTE

38
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,109
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

41
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,620
MAYBE I GOT
A FUTURE IN POLITICS.

42
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,121
ENOUGH OF THE JOKES.

43
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,623
BREAK OUT THE CHAMPAGNE.

44
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,124
I'LL GET IT, BOSS.

45
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,626
NO. FIRST THINGS FIRST.

46
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,127
YOU GUYS CHECK THE HOUSE.

47
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,631

00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,279
WHAT THE FUCK?

52
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,067
JESUS!

53
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,068

LOOK, THERE'S
SOMEBODY THERE.

64
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,611
I GOT
THE TIGHT SHOT.

65
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,480
WHO IS THAT?

66
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,483
HOLY SHIT!
THE PUNISHER!

67
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,117
IT'S HIM!

68
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,620
MOVE IN FOR A CLOSE-UP!

76
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,765
ANSWER ME.

77
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,267
IT'S YEARS
I'M ASKING YOU WHY.

78
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,269
WHY ARE
THE INNOCENT DEAD

79
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,271
AND THE GUILTY ALIVE?

80
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,773
WHERE IS JUSTICE?

81
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,275
WHERE IS PUNISHMENT?

82
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,778
OR HAVE YOU ALREADY
ANSWERED?

83
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,781
HAVE YOU ALREADY
SAID TO THE WORLD,

84
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:58,284
"HERE IS JUSTICE,
HERE IS PUNISHMENT,"

85
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,786
HERE...

00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,788
IN ME?

87
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,676
MOMMY, AREN'T WE
GOING TO WAIT
FOR DADDY?

88
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,927
DADDY'S WORKING.

89
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,929
WE'LL MEET HIM
AT GRANDMA'S.

90
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,930
OK?

91
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,937

ARE YOU BEING
PRESSURED TO RESIGN

94
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,825
AS HEAD OF THE
PUNISHER TASK FORCE?

95
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,826
NO COMMENT.

96
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,327
DO YOU HAVE LEADS?

97
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,328
NO COMMENT.

98
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,830
DO YOU STILL THINK

99
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,332
FRANK CASTLE
AND THE PUNISHER
ARE THE SAME PERSON?

100
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,333
ABSOLUTELY.

101
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,336
DON'T YOU PEOPLE
HAVE ANYTHING
BETTER TO DO

102
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,337

HEY,
GIVE ME A BREAK.

106
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,849
NOW, THAT WAS SMART.

107
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,350
VERY SMART.

108
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,852
THE CHIEF OF DETECTIVES.

109
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,353
IT MUST BE IMPORTANT.

110
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,855
IT IS.

111
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,357
I HAVE A MESSAGE
FROM THE MAYOR.

112
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,860
I QUOTE,
"FRANK CASTLE IS DEAD."

113
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,863
NO MORE TALK
ABOUT HIM BEING OTHERWISE.

114
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,866
YOU TOW THE LINE
OR YOU GET THE BOOT.

115
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,868
YOU'D GO ALONG
WITH THAT, TOO.

116
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,870
WE CANNOT LET
THE PUBLIC THINK

117
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,755
THERE'S SOME PSYCHOTIC
EX-COP WHACKING OFF
WISE GUYS

118
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,757
LIKE HE'S GOT
A HUNTING LICENSE.

119
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,758
WHY NOT?

120
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,259
WHY NOT?

121
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,261

122
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,763
I'M TIRED.

123
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,265
YOU'RE WARNED.

124
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,271
WHAT THE HELL
EVER HAPPENED TO YOU?

125
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,284
EXCUSE ME,
LIEUTENANT BERKOWITZ?

126
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,786
I'M DETECTIVE SAM LEARY.

127
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,787
SAM?

128
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,288
SAMANTHA.

129
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,791
I WORKED WITH YOU ONCE
FIVE YEARS AGO.

130
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,793
DID THE MORETTI
HEROIN BUST.

131
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,796
IT WAS MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT
PLAIN-CLOTHES.

132
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,297
I WAS THE HOOKER.

133
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,298
OH, RIGHT.

134
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,667
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
DETECTIVE?

135
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,669
I'D LIKE TO BE
YOUR PARTNER.

136
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:16,172
I DON'T WORK
WITH A PARTNER.

137
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,673
BUT YOU USED TO.

138
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,926
USED TO.
PAST TENSE.

139
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,679
I'M NOT AFTER
A FREE RIDE.

140
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,681
I CAN CARRY MY SHARE
OF THE LOAD.

141
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,183
I'M SURE YOU CAN.

142
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:30,186
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE NOT
EVEN LISTENING.

143
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:31,187
THAT'S RIGHT.

144
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,189
I'M NOT EVEN LISTENING.

145
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,190
WHY?

146
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,691
I WORK WITH THE BEST.

147
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:37,693
ANYTHING ELSE
IS A WASTE OF MY TIME.

148
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,695
THINK YOU'RE
THE FIRST TO APPLY?

149
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:42,198
NO, BUT I'M
THE MOST QUALIFIED.

150
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:43,199
WHAT MAKES
YOU THINK THAT?

151
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,701
I GRADUATED FIRST
IN MY CLASS
AT THE ACADEMY.

152
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:48,704
I SCORED
IN THE TOP 1%
IN THE TARGET RANGE.

153
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,207
I MADE DETECTIVE
FIRST TIME UP,

154
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:54,210
THE SECOND YOUNGEST
ON THE FORCE
TO DO THAT.

155
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,712
IT MUST MAKE
YOUR PARENTS PROUD.

156
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:59,715
BUT WHY SHOULD
IT MAKE YOU MY PARTNER?

157
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:04,720
I BELIEVE
THAT FRANK CASTLE'S
THE PUNISHER.

158
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:09,725
KNOW WHERE
MY OFFICE IS?

159
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,727
YEAH.

160
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:15,731
YOU BE THERE
AT 9:00 SHARP.

161
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,492
MR. FRANCO,
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE BACK HOME?

162
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,495
IN THE 30 MINUTES
SINCE I'VE LANDED,
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

163
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,247
HAVE YOU COME
TO TAKE OVER?

164
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,748
IT WAS A LONG FLIGHT.

165
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,250
GIVE HIM A BREAK.

166
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,252
AREN'T YOU AFRAID
OF THE PUNISHER?

167
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:39,255
IN EUROPE,
THEY THINK
YOU MADE IT UP

168
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:40,756
TO SELL
NEWSPAPERS.

169
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:43,759
WHAT'S BEEN KILLING
YOUR ASSOCIATES
FOR FIVE YEARS?

170
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,761
TOO MUCH STRESS,
I GUESS.

171
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:47,263
THANKS FOR COMING.

172
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,265
COME ON. VANISH.

173
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:50,766
JUST A SECOND.

174
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,770
CAN I HELP YOU,
DETECTIVE?

175
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:58,274
OH, YOU ALREADY HAVE,
FRANCO.

176
00:10:58,274 --> 00:10:59,775
REALLY? HOW?

177
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:02,778
KIND OF LIKE
A WORM HELPS A FISHERMAN.

178
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,782
I'M GLAD YOU FINALLY
CAME HOME, GIANNI.

179
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:09,285
I WAS RUNNING
OUT OF BAIT.

180
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:10,786
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

181
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:14,790
TOO MUCH STRESS, HUH?

182
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,293
THAT'S FUNNY.

183
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,180
HOW'D YOU
LIKE IT THERE?

184
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,682
IT WAS OK.

185
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,184
LEARN GOOD STUFF
IN THOSE FANCY SCHOOLS?

186
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,686
SHOW HIM SOMETHING.

187
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,187
YOU GOT A QUARTER?

188
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,689
SURE.

189
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,190
HERE YOU GO.

190
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,191
WATCH HIM.

191
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,196
HEY, THAT'S GREAT.

192
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,200
I CAN DO IT WITH $10.

193
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,202
THAT'S EXPENSIVE FOR ME.

194
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,706
GIVE THIS TO LOUIE
IN THE KITCHEN.

195
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,709
ASK HIM TO GIVE YOU
MORE CHEESECAKE.

196
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,710
LOSE SOMETHING?

197
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,211
HEH HEH!

198
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,218
SO TELL ME.

199
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
HOW BAD IS IT?

200
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,722
HOW BAD?

201
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,724
IF YOU DIDN'T
COME HOME,

202
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,727
I WOULD BE HEAD
OF THE FAMILY.

203
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,730
IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE FAMILIES ANYMORE.

204
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,231
THAT'S OLD THINKING.

205
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,233
IT'S DAD THINKING.

206
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,235
THERE'LL BE
NO MORE WARS,

207
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,737
NO MORE TERRITORIES.

208
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,239
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO CONVINCE ANYONE?

209
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,743
WITH AN ACT
OF GOOD FAITH
SO GENEROUS

210
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,747
THAT EVEN
FREDDY DeLEO
WILL SEE THE LIGHT.

211
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,248
A WEEK FROM NOW,

212
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,251
I'VE ARRANGED
FOR 600 KILOS
OF PURE JUNK

213
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,753
TO COME IN.

214
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,754
600 KEYS?

215
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,255
$500 MILLION WORTH.

216
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,757
EVERYONE GETS
THEIR SHARE,

217
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,760
PROVIDED
THEY WORK TOGETHER
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

218
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,262
ONE GROUP
ON SECURITY,

219
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,764
ONE AT RECEIVING,

220
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,265
ONE IN COLLECTING,

221
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,767
ONE IN DISTRIBUTION.

222
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,769
THAT WOULDN'T
BE TOO HARD.

223
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,772
AND WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT THE PUNISHER?

224
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,274
ONE THING
AT A TIME, JIM.

225
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,278
FIRST WE CONSOLIDATE.

226
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,781
AND THEN WE OBLITERATE.

227
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:19,915
EXCUSE ME,
KIND SIR,

228
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:22,918
BUT I CAN'T HELP
BUT SEE IN YOU

229
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:25,421
A MAN FAR
LUCKIER THAN ME.

230
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,422
WHAT?

231
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:29,425
WHATEVER YOU CAN SPARE
WILL BE SUFFICIENT.

232
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,427
AND THIS OLD THESPIAN--

233
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:34,930
WHAT THE HELL'S
A THESPIAN?

234
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,932
AN ACTOR, SIR.

235
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,435
OH, SURE.

236
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:42,938
THANK YOU.

237
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:44,440
HEY.

238
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,942
WHAT'D I TELL YOU
ABOUT BUGGING
THE CUSTOMERS?

239
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:47,943
RICHIE.

240
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,446
THROW THIS TRASH
OUT OF HERE.

241
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,951
YOU CAN'T
TREAT ME LIKE THIS.

242
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,453
I DEMAND SOME RESPECT!

243
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:58,954
I'M NOT TRASH!

244
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:01,457
I'M A MAN!

245
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,463
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE TRIED
SOME EUGENE O'NEILL.

246
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:09,965
AW.

247
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:53,008
HI THERE.

248
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,012
NICE WEATHER
WE ARE HAVING FOR--

249
00:14:57,012 --> 00:15:03,018
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET ME HERE
FOUR HOURS AGO.

250
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:04,019
I KNOW.

251
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,021
I'VE HEARD IT
ALL MY LIFE.

252
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:08,023
CHECKS, RESPONSIBILITY...

253
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,026
CAN'T KEEP
AN APPOINTMENT.

254
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:13,529
WHERE IS THE DOPE
COMING INTO?

255
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:15,030
THE DOPE.

256
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,533
THE DOPE.

257
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,034
OH, THAT.

258
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,537
PIER 30.

259
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,545
BUT THE LOCATION'S
NOT THE BIG STORY.

260
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:31,547
WHO'LL BE THERE IS.

261
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,549
WHO'LL BE THERE?

262
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:34,550
EVERYONE.

263
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,052
THEY'RE ALL
WORKING TOGETHER NOW.

264
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:38,554
ONE BIG, HAPPY FAMILY

265
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:42,558
UNDER THE FATHERLY WING
OF YOUR OLD FRIEND
GIANNI FRANCO.

266
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,064
MR. P!

267
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:51,066
HAPPY HUNTING.

268
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,581
ALLEZ, VITE.
ILS RAPPROCHENT.

269
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,589
I CAN'T GET THIS
FRIGGING THING TO WORK.

270
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:18,594
[BEEP]

271
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,095
VERY DIFFICULT.

272
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,597
WELL, FUCK YOU.

273
00:16:21,597 --> 00:16:23,098
FUCK YOU!

274
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,600
FUCK YOU!

275
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,603
HEY, THERE'S $500 MILLION
OUT THERE, ASSHOLES.

276
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:29,104
COOL OUT!

277
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:30,606
HERE,
CHECK THE PERIMETER.

278
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,107
GET WITH IT.

279
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,111
HELLO, RED 1.

280
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:37,112
COME IN.

281
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,616
RED 1, WILL YOU
GET OFF YOUR ASS?

282
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:42,117
WHAT?

283
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:43,619
EVERYTHING'S OK?

284
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:44,620
YEAH.

285
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,628
RED 2, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

286
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,129
BAD KIDNEYS.
I GOT TO PEE.

287
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,632
SO PEE.
EVERYTHING'S OK?

288
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:57,633
YEAH.

289
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,134
IT'S DEAD HERE.

290
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,276
THE U.S. COAST GUARD.

291
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,777
CUT YOUR ENGINES.

292
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,780
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

293
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,283
WE HAD TO PULL INTO DOCK.

294
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,784
OUR HULL IS LEAKING.

295
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,786
DOWN THERE.
HAVE A LOOK.

296
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,816
15 MINUTES LATE.

297
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,817
JESUS CHRIST.

298
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,319
FUCKING FAGGOT
FRENCHMEN.

299
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,821
HERE THEY COME.
HERE THEY COME!

300
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,364
YOU'RE 15 MINUTES LATE,
YOU STUPID DICKHEAD.

301
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,865
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

302
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,593
HEY, GUYS,
GET BACK THERE.

303
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,596
600 KILOS OF DOPE.

304
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,097
SEVEN DEAD WISE GUYS.

305
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,099
ALL FROM
DIFFERENT FAMILIES.

306
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,102
GUESS IT'S
A DRUG DEAL GONE BAD.

307
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,111
GUESS AGAIN.

308
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:21,280
AAH!

309
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,802
IDIKO TANAKA.

310
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,803
SHE'S SINGLE,

311
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,305
IN HER EARLY 40s.

312
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,806
SHE HAS ONE DAUGHTER,

313
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,809
A MUTE AMERICAN GIRL
SHE ADOPTED AT BIRTH

314
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,311
WHO NEVER
LEAVES HER SIGHT.

315
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,314
SHE'S A GRADUATE FROM
HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL

316
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,817
AND THE FIRST FEMALE
EVER TO HEAD THE YAKUZA.

317
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,319
YAKU WHAT?

318
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,321
YAKUZA.

319
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,322
JAPANESE MAFIA.

320
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,824
THIS IS A LONG
FUCKING WAY FROM JAPAN.

321
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,826
WHAT ARE THEY
DOING HERE?

322
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
I DON'T KNOW.

323
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,330
WE ARE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT.

324
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
OK.

325
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,842
LADY TANAKA.

326
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,344
MR. FRANCO.

327
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,346
IT IS AN HONOR.

328
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,848
YOUR REPUTATION
PRECEDES YOU.

329
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,350
AS DOES YOURS.

330
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,851
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

331
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,353
NO, THANK YOU.

332
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,356
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
WILL BE BRIEF.

333
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,858
WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING
YOUR ORGANIZATION

334
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,360
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

335
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,364
YOUR LEADERSHIP
IS DECIMATED.

336
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,366
YOUR SOLDIERS
ARE INEXPERIENCED.

337
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,868
OUR LITTLE
DEMONSTRATION ON PIER 30

338
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,870
WAS AMPLE PROOF OF THAT.

339
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,375
YOU'RE WEAK, MR. FRANCO,

340
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,377
VULNERABLE...

341
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,879
AND WE ARE NOT.

342
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,883
WE COULD CRIPPLE
ALL YOUR OPERATIONS--

343
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:09,388
LEGAL, AS WELL AS ILLEGAL--
VERY EASILY.

344
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,893
BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT.

345
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,896
WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT,

346
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,898
LET'S CUT THROUGH
THE BULLSHIT.

347
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,400
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

348
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,402
A PARTNERSHIP.

349
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,903
DEFINE THE TERM.

350
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,406
YOU WILL
MANAGE AND OVERSEE

351
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,409
ALL YOUR BUSINESS
ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.

352
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,413
WE WILL ASSUME
THE DUTIES OF EXECUTIVE
ADMINISTRATION,

353
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,916
INVESTMENTS,
AND FINANCIAL SERVICES.

354
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:38,917
COME ON!

355
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,919
I'M NOT THROUGH.

356
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,927
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE
AS A SPLIT?

357
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,430
75% FOR US.

358
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,932
25% FOR YOU.

359
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,436
NO FUCKING WAY
AM I GOING TO BE
A SALARY BOY

360
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,438
TO SOME BUNCH
OF NIPS.

361
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,440
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

362
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,942
BUT THE DeLEO FAMILY
GIVES UP SHIT.

363
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,444
WE DON'T WORK
FOR NOBODY.

364
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,946
WHO THE FUCK
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

365
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,948
WE ARE YAKUZA.

366
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,951
WHEN YOUR ANCESTORS
WERE STILL SHEPHERDS
SCREWING SHEEP

367
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,953
ON THE
MEDITERRANEAN COAST,

368
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,956
OURS WERE THE
CRIME LORDS OF ASIA.

369
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,459
I'M NOT
OFFERING TERMS,

370
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,460
MR. FRANCO.

371
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,462
I'M MAKING DEMANDS.

372
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,964
AND WHAT IF WE
CHOOSE NOT TO COMPLY?

373
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,968
STEPS ARE NOW BEING TAKEN
TO ENSURE THAT YOU WILL.

374
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,973
YOU AMERICANS HAVE
A GREAT CAPACITY FOR VIOLENCE.

375
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,977
BUT IT'S
WILD, UNFOCUSED.

376
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,479
YOU WILL LEARN.

377
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,736
GOOD DAY, GENTLEMEN.

378
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,241
WHAT DO WE DO?

379
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,244
ONLY ONE THING WE CAN.

380
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,247
WE GO TO WAR.

381
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:13,128
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO DO WITH THAT,

382
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:15,130
PLAY MS. PAC-MAN
OR SOMETHING?

383
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,631
HOPEFULLY FIND CASTLE.

384
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:17,632
NO SHIT.

385
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:18,633
NO SHIT.

386
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:20,135
UH-HUH.

387
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:23,138
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO ACCOMPLISH
THIS LITTLE MIRACLE?

388
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:26,141
I'VE ACCESSED
INTO ALL AVAILABLE
DATA BANKS

389
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,143
WITH INFORMATION
ON HIM

390
00:25:28,143 --> 00:25:31,146
AND PROGRAMMED
THE COMPUTER
TO FORM AN ANALYSIS

391
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:32,781
OF PROBABLE
LOCATIONS.

392
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,782
OH, WOW.

393
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,785
EVEN THE PUNISHER
HAS TO LIVE SOMEWHERE.

394
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,295
HEY.

395
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,799
YOU SEE
THIS BOARD HERE?

396
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,800
YEAH.

397
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,302
I'VE BEEN LIVING
WITH IT FOR FIVE YEARS.

398
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,804
EVERY TIME
HE KILLS SOMEBODY,

399
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,305
I PUT A PIN THERE.

400
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,307
I FINE-TOOTH
EVERY BUILDING,

401
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,810
EVERY ALLEY,
IN THIS CITY.

402
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,313
THE ONLY THING THAT
I'VE GOT TO SHOW FOR IT

403
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,316
IS THESE LITTLE
CALLING CARDS HERE...

404
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,569
AND A WHOLE
BUNCH OF THESE.

405
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,574
I'VE ALREADY BEEN
THROUGH THIS CITY.

406
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,578
I'VE BEEN IN IT,
AROUND IT,
ON TOP OF IT.

407
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,080
YOU NAME IT.

408
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,834
HOW ABOUT UNDER IT?

409
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,344
I GET THE RED.

410
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,846
I HATE YELLOW.

411
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,347
THE RED'S GROSS, JENNY.

412
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,349
I THINK IT'S
TOTALLY HOT.

413
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,854
HI. I'M PETER BEAR.
I REALLY CARE.

414
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,857
AND TO SHOW YOU
IT'S TRUE,

415
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,109
I HAVE THINGS
TO TEACH YOU.

416
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,727
LIKE WHAT, PETER?

417
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,229
OHH!
OHH!

418
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,121
COME ON!

419
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,122
WAIT UP!

420
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,130
ROGER?

421
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,633
ROGER?

422
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,508
HELLO?

423
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,510
HELLO?

424
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,013
COME OUT.

425
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,515
COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

426
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:31,516
OH!

427
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,020
BUBBLE, BUBBLE,
TOIL AND TROUBLE,

428
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,523
I BETTER GET OUT OF HERE
ON THE DOUBLE.

429
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:40,525
AAH!

430
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,531
WITH YOUR FLAIR
FOR ENTRANCES,

431
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,534
YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER A CAREER
IN THE THEATER.

432
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,037
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

433
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,540
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

434
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,542
WHAT WOULD I
BE DOING,

435
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,545
TRAMPING AROUND
THE SEWERS OF THIS
GREAT METROPOLIS?

436
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,047
SIGHTSEEING.

437
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,549
HEH HEH. VERY FUNNY.

438
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,552
I BRING YOU NEWS,
YOU GIVE ME GRIEF.

439
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,057
YOU KNOW, THEY ALL
THINK YOU'RE DEAD.

440
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,559
THEY'LL KILL
EACH OTHER NOW.

441
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,563
TURN THE LIGHTS OFF
WHEN YOU LEAVE.

442
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,565
VERY CLEVER.

443
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,567
AND WHAT
WILL YOU DO

444
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,069
WHILE THE
CARNAGE ENSUES?

445
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,570
TAKE A VACATION.

446
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,073
YES, I HEAR
THE SEWERS OF PARIS

447
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,575
ARE LOVELY
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

448
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,577
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE CHILDREN?

449
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:33,578
WHAT CHILDREN?

450
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,081
THE CHILDREN
OF THE NEW BOSSES

451
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,583
ARE NOW COUNTED
AMONG THEIR LOSSES.

452
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,087
THEY'RE BEING
HELD FOR RANSOM
BY THE JAPANESE.

453
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,090
SO THE BOSSES
WILL HAVE TO PAY UP.

454
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,092
PAY THEY WILL
AND ALL FOR NAUGHT.

455
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,594
THE CHILDREN
WILL BE SOLD BY
THE SLAVE TRADE--

456
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,096
THEY'VE BEEN BOUGHT.

457
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,098
MY GOD, MAN,
DON'T YOU SEE?

458
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:56,101
THIS IS THE RESULT
OF YOUR FIVE-YEAR
KILLING SPREE.

459
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,603
YOU WEAKENED
THE FATHERS
TO SUCH DEGREES,

460
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,606
THEY COULDN'T
PROTECT THEIR
OWN FAMILIES.

461
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,609
I PUNISH THE GUILTY.

462
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,496
AND AS A RESULT,
THE INNOCENT
NOW SUFFER.

463
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,503
YOU MUST DO SOMETHING!

464
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,506
YOU MUST DO SOMETHING.

465
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,511
ENOUGH OF
THIS FUCKING
BRAINSTORMING.

466
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,013
LET'S SNATCH
HER DAUGHTER,

467
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,514
TAKE HER
TO THE MEETING

468
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,016
WITH THIS
IN HER MOUTH,

469
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,517
THEN WE TALK.

470
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,519
BEFORE YOU
GO SNATCHING ANYBODY,

471
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,022
LET ME TELL YOU
A STORY

472
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,523
ABOUT OUR MISS TANAKA.

473
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,026
THE ONLY PERSON
SHE WAS EVER CLOSE TO

474
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,527
WAS HER TWIN BROTHER.

475
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,530
THEY GREW UP IN
A TOKYO ORPHANAGE

476
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,032
AFTER THE SECOND
WORLD WAR.

477
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,533
THEY WERE INSEPARABLE.

478
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,535
THEY LIVED TOGETHER
THEIR WHOLE LIVES.

479
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,537
ONE DAY HE STUCK
THE YAKUZA

480
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,539
FOR A LOT OF MONEY,

481
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,042
WHICH HE HAD NO INTENTION
OF PAYING BACK.

482
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,045
NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM
BECAUSE OF HER.

483
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,048
THEN OTHER PEOPLE STARTED
GETTING THE SAME IDEA.

484
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:04,552
BEFORE SHE COULD BECOME
HEAD OF THE ORGANIZATION,

485
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:09,057
THE OTHER LEADERS DEMANDED
AN ACT OF ABSOLUTE LOYALTY.

486
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,059
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DID?

487
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,063
SHE WENT HOME,

488
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:19,567
COOKED HER BROTHER
A BEAUTIFUL MEAL,

489
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,570
WAITED UNTIL
HE HAD FINISHED,

490
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,073
AND THEN SLIT
HIS THROAT.

491
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,074
JESUS.

492
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,575
WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

493
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,577
WE DON'T DEAL
WITH HER?

494
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,579
WECAN'T
DEAL WITH HER.

495
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,082
YOU'RE SAYING
THERE'S NOTHING THAT
CAN SAVE OUR KIDS.

496
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,586
THERE IS, BUT IT'S LYING
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HARBOR.

497
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,091
WELL, I'M GOING
TO THE MEETING.

498
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,092
YEAH.

499
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,094
YEAH, I'M GOING, TOO.

500
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,097
I'M NOT.

501
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,931
GOOD.

502
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,933
THE MONEY
FOR THE CHILDREN.

503
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,052
THE SLAVE BUSINESS
IS VERY PROFITABLE.

504
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,939
COME ON. DON'T CRY.

505
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,941
WE'RE GOING TO BE OK.

506
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,944
WE'RE NOT. IT'S BECAUSE
OF MY FATHER I'M HERE.

507
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,445
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

508
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,447
THEN WHY ARE
WE HERE?

509
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,949
I DON'T KNOW.

510
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,450
WE'RE BEING HELD
FOR RANSOM

511
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,953
BECAUSE OUR FATHERS
ARE RICH GANGSTERS.

512
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,455
BUT MY FATHER'S
NOT A GANGSTER.

513
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,957
ARE YOU KIDDING?

514
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,959
YOUR FATHER'S
THE BIGGEST GANGSTER

515
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,460
AND A COWARD.

516
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,463
MY DAD SAID
HE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS MESS.

517
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,464
BULLSHIT!

518
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,966
YOU'RE BULLSHIT!

519
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,480
WHY ARE YOU
FIGHTING?

520
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,984
EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.

521
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,986
I WANT TO GO HOME.

522
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,988
AND YOU WILL.

523
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,989
WHEN?

524
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,490
SOON.

525
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,996
SHH.

526
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,499
NO MORE TEARS.

527
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,003
HERE.

528
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,007
COME WITH ME.

529
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,508
LEAVE HER ALONE.

530
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,012
OW!

531
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,026
UHH!

532
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:19,424
COME IN.

533
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:20,925
THANK YOU.

534
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,433
HI.

535
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,964
HERE'S YOUR USUAL.

536
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,511
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

537
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,513
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

538
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,031
EVERY DAY
THE CHILDREN
ARE GONE,

539
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,533
IT'S GOING TO
COST YOU MONEY.

540
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:16,541
TAKE THAT MESSAGE
TO YOUR PEOPLE.

541

00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:41,187
I'M SCARED.

725
00:55:41,688 --> 00:55:42,689
YAAH!

726
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:22,789
SHIT! COPS!

727
00:57:28,795 --> 00:57:30,296
HOLD ON!

728
00:57:51,317 --> 00:57:53,319
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

729
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:55,822
COME ON, KIDS.
COME ON. OVER HERE.

730
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:56,823
HURRY. HURRY.

731
00:57:56,823 --> 00:57:58,324
IS MY MOMMY HERE?

732
00:57:58,324 --> 00:57:59,325
HURRY!

733
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:48,007
HELLO, FRANK.

734
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:51,511
HOW YOU BEEN?

735
00:58:55,515 --> 00:58:56,516
BUSY.

736
00:58:56,516 --> 00:58:58,017
OH, I KNOW.

737
00:59:03,523 --> 00:59:05,024
I KNOW YOU HAVE.

738
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:10,530
I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE BODY COUNT.

739
00:59:13,533 --> 00:59:15,535
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED, FRANK?

740
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:18,037
FRANK IS DEAD.

741
00:59:18,037 --> 00:59:19,539
ALL RIGHT?

742
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,041
OH, I SEE.

743
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:26,546
SO YOU DECIDED
EVERYBODY ELSE
HAD TO BE DEAD, TOO.

744
00:59:26,546 --> 00:59:28,047
IS THAT IT?

745
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:29,048
NAH.

746
00:59:29,048 --> 00:59:32,552
IF YOU'RE GUILTY,
YOU'RE DEAD.

747
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:38,057
COURTS DECIDE
WHO'S GUILTY,

748
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:39,559
NOT COPS.

749
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,063
THEY HEREBY SWEAR
TO UPHOLD THE LAW.

750
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:45,064
REMEMBER?

751
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:53,573
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
FOR FIVE YEARS, MAN.

752
00:59:56,576 --> 00:59:59,579
WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU
COME TO ME FOR HELP?

753
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,081
I DIDN'T NEED YOUR HELP.

754
01:00:02,582 --> 01:00:05,084
YOU'RE SICK.
YOU KNOW THAT,
DON'T YOU?

755
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:11,090
NO, I'M NOT.

756
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:15,094
THEN WHAT THE FUCK
YOU CALL 125 MURDERS
IN FIVE YEARS?

757
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:18,097
WORK IN PROGRESS.

758
01:00:18,598 --> 01:00:20,099
GOD DAMN YOU! LOOK!

759
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:22,101
IT'S NO FUCKING JOKE HERE.

760
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:24,604
THEY ARE GOING
TO ELECTROCUTE YOU,

761
01:00:24,604 --> 01:00:27,106
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT.

762
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:28,608
TALK TO ME, MAN.

763
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:29,609
LET ME IN!

764
01:00:29,609 --> 01:00:31,110
LET ME IN!

765
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:32,612
THEY WERE MY FAMILY, TOO.

766
01:00:32,612 --> 01:00:34,614
THEY WERE MY FAMILY, TOO.

767
01:00:34,614 --> 01:00:38,618
LET ME IN,
GOD DAMN IT!
LET ME IN!

768
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:41,120
I SEE.

769
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,623
YOU WANT TO DIE.
IS THAT IT?

770
01:00:43,623 --> 01:00:46,125
WELL, FUCK YOU.
GO AHEAD AND DIE.

771
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:49,629
THE FRANK I KNEW
DIED FIVE YEARS AGO.

772
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:51,631
FUCK YOU!

773
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:58,137
OPEN THIS DOOR.

774
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,152
HA HA HA HA!

775
01:01:16,155 --> 01:01:17,774
NO! PLEASE DON'T!

776
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,161
AAH!

777
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:26,416
IN A FEW MOMENTS,

778
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,917
FRANK CASTLE,
THE EX-POLICE OFFICER

779
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,920
WHO'S WAGED A ONE-MAN WAR
AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME

780
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,422
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS,

781
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:35,425
WILL BE ESCORTED TO COURT
TO FACE AN UNPRECEDENTED

782
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:37,927
125 FIRST-DEGREE
MURDER CHARGES.

783
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,430
THERE'S STILL NO NEWS
AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS

784
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:41,931
OF TOMMY FRANCO,

785
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,934
THE SON OF CRIME BOSS
GIANNI FRANCO.

786
01:01:56,062 --> 01:01:57,563
WHERE'S BERKOWITZ?

787
01:01:58,064 --> 01:01:59,065
HURTING.

788
01:02:01,067 --> 01:02:02,568
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU TWO--

789
01:02:02,568 --> 01:02:03,569
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

790
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:06,572
HEY, I CARE.
I'M HIS PARTNER.

791
01:02:06,572 --> 01:02:09,575
HE CARRIED THE BURDEN
FOR A LONG TIME
BY HIMSELF.

792
01:02:12,078 --> 01:02:15,081
HE NEEDED HELP,
AND YOU WEREN'T THERE.

793
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:17,834
I WAS THE NEXT BEST THING.

794
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,837
HE RESIGNED
FROM THE FORCE
AFTER SEEING YOU.

795
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:23,339
HE LIVED
FOR THE DAY
HE FOUND YOU.

796
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:27,343
THAT'S ALL HE HAD,
AND NOW YOU'VE
TAKEN THAT AWAY.

797
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,845
HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

798
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:32,849
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO TAKE HIM DOWN
WITH YOU?

799
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,852
YOU WERE HIS LIFE
BEFORE THIS EVER HAPPENED,

800
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:38,354
AND YOU'VE BEEN HIS LIFE
EVER SINCE,

801
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:41,357
AND YOU FUCKING WELL
KNOW THAT.

802
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:44,360
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
SOMEONE CAN LIVE

803
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,863
AFTER YOU'VE
CUT OUT THEIR HEART?

804
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,366
A LONG TIME.

805
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:53,369
LIKE YOU?
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT FOR JAKE?

806
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,372
TO LIVE LIKE YOU?

807
01:02:58,374 --> 01:02:59,876
CALL HIM.

808
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:00,877
WHAT?

809
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,379
I SAID, CALL HIM.

810
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:34,911
NIGHTY-NIGHT, ASSHOLE.

811
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:51,928
LET HIM BE.

812
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,935
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FAMILY
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO.

813
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:02,939
IF I COULD UNDO IT,
I WOULD, BUT I CAN'T.

814
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:06,943
I SWEAR THIS ON THE LIFE
OF MY SON THOMAS ANTHONY.

815
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,947
I WANT HIM BACK.

816
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:16,452
I CAN'T DO IT MYSELF,
OR I WOULD.

817
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,456
I NEED YOU, CASTLE.

818
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:22,959
I'LL GIVE YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

819
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,961
I'LL DO
ANYTHING YOU WISH.

820
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,465
SAY SOMETHING.

821
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:31,467
FUCK YOU.

822
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:35,972
LET ME PUT IT
ANOTHER WAY.

823
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,987
A LIFE FOR A LIFE.

824
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:54,490
I'M NOT GOING
TO ASK YOU TWICE, CASTLE.

825
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:58,995
WELL?

826
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,005
OK.

827
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:11,007
OK, I'LL DO IT.

828
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:13,509
BUT UNDERSTAND...

829
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:17,513
WHEN THIS IS OVER,
YOU'RE DEAD.

830
01:05:28,274 --> 01:05:29,775
THE ELEVATOR
STOPS AT 40.

831
01:05:30,276 --> 01:05:31,277
THEY'RE ON 41.

832
01:05:31,777 --> 01:05:35,281
WE NEED A KEY TO GET THERE,
WHICH THE LOBBY GUARD HAS.

833
01:05:35,781 --> 01:05:37,283
FIVE MINUTES.
PUSH THE FIRST BUTTON.

834
01:05:37,783 --> 01:05:39,285
WHAT'S THAT
GOING TO DO?

835
01:05:42,788 --> 01:05:43,789
BLOW OUT THE LIGHTS.

836
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:45,791
SIR, JUST IN CASE,

837
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:49,295
IT'S BEEN AN HONOR
TO HAVE KNOWN YOU.

838
01:05:51,297 --> 01:05:52,298
LIKEWISE.

839
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:55,301
CASTLE, HERE'S
SOME BODY ARMOR
FOR YOU.

840
01:05:55,801 --> 01:05:57,303
JUST IN CASE.

841
01:05:57,803 --> 01:05:59,305
HERE. JUST IN CASE.

842
01:06:00,806 --> 01:06:02,308
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

843
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:04,810
15 MINUTES.

844
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:07,813
YOU HIT
THE SECOND BUTTON.

845
01:06:08,314 --> 01:06:09,815
WHAT'S THAT GOING
TO BLOW OUT?

846
01:06:10,316 --> 01:06:11,817
EVERYTHING ELSE.

847
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:20,826
HEY.

848
01:06:22,328 --> 01:06:23,829
I GOT TO
TAKE A LEAK.

849
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:25,331
BE MY GUEST.

850
01:06:25,831 --> 01:06:26,832
THAT'S FINE.

851
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:29,835
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE BOSS WILL SAY

852
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:33,339
ABOUT A YELLOW STAIN
ON THE SEAT.

853
01:06:39,845 --> 01:06:41,847
HEY, HEY, MAN!
THAT'S SKIN BACK THERE.

854
01:06:42,348 --> 01:06:43,849
TAKE IT EASY.

855
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:44,850
UM...

856
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:46,352
WHAT?

857
01:06:48,354 --> 01:06:51,357
ARE YOU GOING TO HANDLE
THE EQUIPMENT FOR ME?

858
01:06:56,862 --> 01:06:57,363
IN FRONT.

859
01:06:57,863 --> 01:06:59,365
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

860
01:06:59,865 --> 01:07:00,366
WHAT?

861
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:02,868
IS AN IQ TEST
REQUIRED FOR THIS JOB?

862
01:07:02,868 --> 01:07:03,869
NO.

863
01:07:07,373 --> 01:07:08,874
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

864
01:07:10,876 --> 01:07:12,511
HEY, MAN,
I GOT THE PIZZA.

865
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:41,290
PSST.

866
01:08:49,108 --> 01:08:51,110
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

867
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:56,115
WHAT'S THE REASON BEHIND
YOU KILLING ALL THOSE GUYS?

868
01:08:56,115 --> 01:08:58,617
THERE'S A LIMIT
TO REVENGE.

869
01:08:59,118 --> 01:09:01,120
WELL, I HAVEN'T
REACHED MINE YET.

870
01:09:42,528 --> 01:09:43,412
WHICH WAY?

871
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:47,416
NOT THAT WAY.

872
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,502
YOU GO THAT WAY.

873
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,635
[SIREN]

874
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:53,412
YOU ALL RIGHT?

875
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:56,165
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THIS POOR, OLD SLOB.

876
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,167
GET ON THE CASE.
DO THE JOB.

877
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,668
TAKE CARE OF THIS GUY.

878
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:02,788
I'LL OPERATE
UNDER MY OWN STEAM,
THANK YOU.

879
01:14:15,934 --> 01:14:17,302
HERE. HOLD THIS.

880
01:14:33,819 --> 01:14:34,820
TOMMY!

881
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:35,821
DAD!

882
01:14:37,322 --> 01:14:38,323
TOMMY!

883
01:14:40,826 --> 01:14:44,079
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
TO GET AN ELEVATOR?

884
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:45,581
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

885
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,583
ELEVATORS ARE VERY
TEMPERAMENTAL THINGS.

886
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,085
SO DO COPS WHO HATE
BEING JERKED AROUND.

887
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:51,086
10 MINUTES.

888
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,088
HOW LONG?
HEY, HOW LONG?

889
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,090
UH, FIVE MINUTES?

890
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,727
AH, MR. FRANCO.

891
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,730
HOW NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

892
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,232
LET HIM GO.

893
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,735
YOU'VE GOTTEN EVERYTHING
YOU WANTED.

894
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,739
NOT QUITE YET.

895
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,830
TAKE ANOTHER STEP,
MR. FRANCO.

896
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,832
WELL, YOU
CAN'T WIN HERE.

897
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,335
YOU KILL HIM,
I KILL YOU.

898
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:47,836
AND WHO LOSES MORE?

899
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,838
CERTAINLY NOT ME.

900
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:00,849
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

901
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:02,351
ON YOUR KNEES.

902
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:06,355
ON YOUR KNEES!

903
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:12,861
PUT THE GUN
IN YOUR MOUTH.

904
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:18,867
YOU HAVE MY WORD
HE WILL LIVE.

905
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:21,870
HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'LL KEEP IT?

906
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,372
YOU DON'T,

907
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:26,875
BUT SOME CHANCE
IS BETTER THAN NO CHANCE.

908
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:36,385
ALL THE WAY IN.

909
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,387
PULL THAT TRIGGER,
MR. FRANCO.

910
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:39,888
NOW! NOW!

911
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:43,392
THIS IS PART
OF YOUR EDUCATION.
YOU WATCH.

912
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:46,395
GOODBYE, MR. FRANCO.

913
01:18:05,664 --> 01:18:07,666
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
LET'S GO.

914
01:18:10,168 --> 01:18:11,169
TOMMY?

915
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:12,671
DAD.

916
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:13,922
TOMMY.

917
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:17,926
LET ME HAVE
A LOOK AT YOU.
CARE TO WALK?

918
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:19,428
YEAH.

919
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:20,679
OK. COME ON.

920
01:18:28,553 --> 01:18:30,555
WAIT OUTSIDE, MY SON.

921
01:18:32,557 --> 01:18:33,558
I'LL SEE TO HIM.

922
01:18:34,059 --> 01:18:35,060
I CAN HELP HIM.

923
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,561
WAIT OUTSIDE, TOMMY.

924
01:18:51,209 --> 01:18:53,595
I MUST
COMPLIMENT YOU, CASTLE.

925
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,598
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
I NEVER DREAMED POSSIBLE.

926
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:59,101
YOU'VE WIPED OUT
THE COMPETITION.

927
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:02,104
THANKS TO YOU,
THERE'S ONLY ME.

928
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:03,472
IN FIVE YEARS' TIME,

929
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,973
MY NEW ORGANIZATION

930
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:08,477
WILL BE THE MOST POWERFUL
CRIME SYNDICATE ON EARTH,

931
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:11,730
AND THAT BOY
WHOSE LIFE YOU SAVED

932
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:13,732
WILL INHERIT ALL OF IT.

933
01:19:13,732 --> 01:19:16,618
AND THE ONLY THING
HE WILL HAVE TO FEAR,

934
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:19,121
I'M ABOUT TO ELIMINATE.

935
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,127
YOU GAVE ME BACK MY SON.

936
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,629
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'M IN YOUR DEBT.

937
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:31,883
SEE YOU IN HELL,
CASTLE.

938
01:19:31,883 --> 01:19:32,884
DAD!

939
01:19:32,884 --> 01:19:33,752
TOMMY!

940
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:29,057
DAD, STOP!

941
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:30,058
STOP!

942
01:20:34,446 --> 01:20:35,947
DAD, GET OFF HIM!

943
01:20:50,962 --> 01:20:51,963
[GUNSHOT]

944
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,492
DAD?

945
01:21:21,493 --> 01:21:22,360
DAD.

946
01:21:38,877 --> 01:21:40,879
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

947
01:21:47,886 --> 01:21:48,887
GOOD.

948
01:21:50,388 --> 01:21:53,892
MAYBE IF YOU
GET IT OVER WITH NOW,

949
01:21:53,892 --> 01:21:56,778
YOU WON'T GROW UP
TO BE LIKE HIM.

950
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:08,290
COME ON.

951
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:11,293
DO IT.

952
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:12,794
DO IT.

953
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:17,299
DO IT.

954
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:32,931
WHAT THE HELL?

955
01:22:33,431 --> 01:22:33,932
[WHISTLES]

956
01:22:34,432 --> 01:22:34,933
WHOA.

957
01:22:35,433 --> 01:22:36,935
ALL RIGHT.
SPLIT UP.

958
01:22:37,936 --> 01:22:38,687
FRANK?

959
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,188
FRANK?

960
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:52,200
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY,
TOMMY.

961
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,203
GROW UP
TO BE A GOOD MAN.

962
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:06,715
BECAUSE IF NOT...

963
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:08,717
I'LL BE WAITING.

964
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:27,852
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

965
01:23:27,852 --> 01:23:30,355
WHICH WAY DID HE GO?

966
01:23:54,379 --> 01:23:55,880
FRANK!

967
01:23:59,884 --> 01:24:02,387
FRANK!

968
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:14,899
I STILL TALK
TO GOD SOMETIMES.

969
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:19,404
I ASK HIM IF WHAT I'M DOING
IS RIGHT OR WRONG.

970
01:24:19,404 --> 01:24:22,407
I'M STILL WAITING
FOR AN ANSWER.

971
01:24:22,407 --> 01:24:25,910
AND UNTIL I GET ONE,
I'LL BE OUT HERE.

972
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:27,412
WAITING.

973
01:24:27,412 --> 01:24:28,413
WATCHING.

974
01:24:30,415 --> 01:24:32,417
THE GUILTY
WILL BE PUNISHED.
