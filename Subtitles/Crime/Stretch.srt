She just looks so
ridiculously happy, doesn't she?

1525
01:30:23,535 --> 01:30:26,036
Not to rub salt in the wound,
but I hear the groom-to-be has

1526
01:30:26,037 --> 01:30:29,339
(SHOUTING)

- I do.
- (LIGHTER CLINKS OPEN)

1534
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,527
He's Leonardo Di Caprio.

Jesus!

1553
01:31:35,772 --> 01:31:38,475
I knew Karos like to fist.

1554
01:31:38,476 --> 01:31:41,243
But it sounds like he's footing, right?
(CHUCKLES)

You're gonna see some shit up
close you've never seen before.
